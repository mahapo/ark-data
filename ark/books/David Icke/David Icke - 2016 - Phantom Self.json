It's an amazing story, really, and one that continues to unfold every day. I was born in Leicester , England, on April 29th 1952 and I felt from an early age that I was here to 'do something'. I didn't know what and I felt at first that the 'something' was to be a professional soccer player. This was my childhood ambition and through many 'coincidences' and strokes of 'luck' I went on to play professional football until rheumatoid arthritis ended my career aged 21. 'Lucky coincidences' have been a constant feature of my life and work and some unseen force has clearly been guiding me through the maze. I went on to be a newspaper, radio and television joLIInalist, spokesman for the British Green Party and, since the tum of the 1990s, one of the most ridiculed people in British history (Fig 1). But today with so many of my 'crazy theories' and exposures confirmed to be true there has been a transformation. More people than ever before are observing the world and world events from a new perspective. It's not the majority yet, nowhere near, but compared with how it used to be a quarter of a century ago what has happened borders on the miraculous. People who once ridiculed me are now reading my books and I hope this has inspired others to speak their truth without fear of the consequences however unpleasant they may be. If what you say has validly it will eventually be shown to be so, but before it can be validated it has to be said. Courage to stand up and speak out is so crucial to unravelling the vast web of global deceit that holds humanity in servitude to engineered ignorance. I was a sports presenter with the BBC and speaking on behalf of the Green Party in 1989 when my Life took a rapid and extraordinary new direction. Throughout that year I felt a presence around me, most tangibly when I was alone. The feeling became stronger and stronger to the point in early 1990 where I felt I could almost touch whatever was there. One night in a London hotel room while working for the BBC the presence was so obvious that I said: 'lf there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you a.re driving me up the waJI!' A few days later I walked into a local newspaper shop and as I s tood in the doorway my feet were suddenly held fast to the ground as if pulled by -\u0001"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2 Phantom Self Figure 1: Journey to sanity.

I'll have to close my eyes for this one.' She said she was seeing a figure in her mind who was asking her to communicate 'his' words to me. First of all I was told that 'They' knew that l wanted them to contact me but it couldn't have happened until nmv because the time wasn't right. Betty knew nothing about what I had said in the London hotel room. This is some of the information that came through Betty that day: • \u0001 He is a healer who i!-i here to heal the Earth and he will be world famous. • \u0001 He b still a child spirih1.1lly, but he will be given the spiritual riches. • \u0001 Sometimes he will !'iil)' things and wonder where they came from.

A week later I saw Betty for the fourth and final time and more messages came through: • \u0001 One man cannot change the world, but one man can communicate the message that \u0002 will change the v·.-orld. \u0002 • \u0001 Don't try· to do it all alone.

My life became a series of incredible coincidences or synchronicities as I was led to knowledge through people , books, documents and personal experiences. It was certainly true that arduous seeking wasn't necessary because the information was finding me. Many, many times I have remembered these lines: 'Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from - they will be our words' and 'Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times h(' will be led to knowledge .' This has absolutely been my experience. I wrote my first book on these subjects in 1990 , called Truth Vibration s, and I would indeed write five books in three years - and many more since. I headed for Peru in early 1991 purely on a powerful intuition that I had to go there, and it wa s an extraordinary trip full of stunning synchronkity and experiences. 'Coincidence' led me to Peruvian ruins at Sillustani near the city of Puno on the shores of Lake Titicaca, 13,000 feet above sea level in the Andes. My Peruvian guide had booked me the night before into a hotel in Puno called the Sillustani and when I saw pictures of the place on the wall r knew I had to go. I went there in a mini-bus I taxi with the driver and my guide (Fig 3). Sillustani is beautiful but after walking around I was disappointed that the strength of my feeling to go there was not matched by what had happened. I returned to the bus and set off back to Puno. A few minutes down the road I was daydreaming and gazing at a hill we were passing when the words 'come to me, come to me, come to me' began repeating in my mind.

Next came the non-human 'Hidden Hand' behind that web and revelation s about the illusory nature of 'physical' reality.

Phantom Self is for readers of my other work~ and take s the story on, but it's also for those coming to my information for the fir~t time.

Let the revelations begin."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE Last Question If you do not change direction , you might end up where you are heading Lao Tsu It may seem odd to start with the 'last' but, as usual with human society, the opposite is the case. Have you noticed that? Again and again, the truth turns out to be an inve rsion of what we have been led to believe. [t is so bl atant when you scan the world that the most effective starti ng point for pursuing the mysteries of life is to take everything you have ever been told and simply flip it. There will be examples where this technique doesn't work - but far, far more where it does. I've spent two and a half decades so far uncovering the lies and deceit that 'The System' peddles as 'truth', and the very foundation of my work has been turning perceived and accepted 'reality' on iL'> head in almost every facet of life . The System is a construct of deception and contro l created by a hidden force that I will be exposing in \" detail later. Until l get there, I will refer to the hidden force or Hidden Hand which is behind what appear s on the surface to be random and unconnected events (Fig 6). They say that we see the world upside down and the brain flips it upright. What 1 am doing, symbolically at Least, is flipping it back. ThJs is what happens when you regain control of your own perception - you see that everything you have been led to believe is an inversion of what is really the case. This book explains why thi s is and how it relates to the sCJ.le and natuie of collective human control. I began my ongoing adventure - at least consciously - in 1990 trying to establi sh why evidence about the nature of reality was virtually ignored by 'education ', media and overwhelmingly by society in general. People were being bombarded with this-world-is-all-there-is ' science' and its alleged polar opposite , pick-your-god religion; but where was the tidal wave of evidence explaining reality in ways that largely demolished both?

The Lie is such, in both scale and depth, that its promotion and impo ~ition is plainly systematic. We did not trip over the Lie by random accident; it come~ courtesy of calculated design. People don't know the very reality they are experiencing because there is a hidden force at work that doesn't want them to know. Given that the force contro ls 'education', media, 'science' and religion, my start-out question of why evidence about reality was suppressed soo n secured an answer; but th ere was so much more, so many revelations and insights as the dot:, began to connect to form an extraordinary picture .

Definitions of the term phantom capture the essence of Phantom Self: 'Something apparently seen, heard, or sensed, but having no physical reality';' An image that appears only in the mind; an illusion'; 'Fictitious or non-existent, often when intended to deceive'; 'Believed to be real even though illusory'. Phantom Self is a downloaded self-identity of your name, country, race, culture, religion I science belief system, family history, life-story and the 'education' I medi,1 versions of virtually everything. These information and perception sources dictate the j sense of who people think they are. They focus human attention almost entirely on the five senses and we become isolated from the insight, knowing and expanded awareness of beyond-the-body Infinite Self which can see, perceive and understand what Phantom Self cannot. Infinite Self speaks to us through intuition and knowing, a state of awareness beyond thought and the lassoed perceptions of the five senses. If we lose touch with Infinite Self we become isolated in Phantom Self and our only source of information and insight to get a fix on life and the world is The System in the form of 'education', media, science and other agencies of deeply controlled five-sense reality (fig 9). We are meant to stay connected with Infinite Self to be in this world, but not completely of it in terms of our perceptions of reality (Fig 10); but the overwhelming majority are manipulated into an isolated bubble of awarene&, and sel.f-identity - Phantom Self (Fig 11).

That is Infinite Self (or some of it) and in most people this has been silenced in pursu it of mass control by a force I will be exposing. Once attention is imprisoned in Phantom Self a lone, with no other perspectiv e, we become a babe-i n- arms to the tyranny of this hidden force which created and controls human society as we live it today. Phantom Self is not who we are , it is simply what we Figu re 13: A wave and its crest are the same ocea n in different a.re experiencing. Confusing the two forms.

Exploration of self and reality is way down the list of priorities for most people. Wlw am I? This is so often the last question, not the first, as it should be. It falls way behind perceived essentials like: What job shall I do? What clothes shall I wear? What phone shall I buy? How do I make lots of money? Who shall I marry? Where shall I go on Saturday night? Sport alone is, for many, light years ahead in priority of 'what is Figure 15: Phantc>m Self-deception. reality?' I'm not saying those other questions should not be considered, or sport should not be enjoyed as a pastime and entertainment- I do myself - but if it's not given perspective then our peripheral vision can be blocked and this is vital to seeing what those in authority don't want you to see. George Orwell wrote in 1984: 'Football, beer and above aJI ga mbling , filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult.' How can we answer any question effectively without some grasp of the master questions- Who am I? Where am I? What is this 'reality' that I daily experience? lf you didn't understand water you might try to walk across it and drown _ The fact you do understand, at least in one sense, means that you either keep away or learn to swim. Humanity is drowning in confusion, bewilderment and chaos because it doesn't understand the very natur e of the world, how we interact with it and each other and that we are creating our own reality whether we like it or not. Funny how most children are taught at an early age about water because that is deemed so essential, but they can go through their entire lives without giving much thought to reality itself. They thus assign their beliefs and perceptions to Phantom Self as they slee pwalk through life believing themselves to be wide awake and looking through blindfolded eyes believing they c,m see (Fig 15). This doesn't get any better for wannabe manipulators of the human experience because moulding humanity to become what they have become would be top of their Christmas list (Fig 16). This is no coincidence, as we shall see.

Co nscious mind is aware of so little whjle the subconscious absorbs everything. Subliminal advert i sing and messages target the subconscious which filters them through to t he conscious mind as 'I'll do this' or 'I'll buy that'. Subliminal means 'below threshold' (below the threshold of the conscious mind) and 99 percent plus of the information we receive goes straight to the subconscious - home of Phantom Self. Our subconscious commurucates through symbolism and so dreams are virhtally always symbolic and rarely literal. The System has its own language of symbolism, wruch I will be explainmg because it is seeking to program perceptions via our subconscious mind. We are experiend ng a reality that can be likened to a computer simulation and the relevance of trus to Phantom Self will become ever clearer as we proceed. So it is hardly a surprise that computer language can invariably be used to describe the human plight. This is especially true of the term 'to program' whid, is defined as 'to arrange (data) into a suitable form that can be processed by a computer' and 'a sequence of coded instructions fed into a computer, enabling it to perform specified logical and arithmetical operations on data'. This is describing most human thought processes which together create what we call human society. lnformation (data) is fed to the human mind (education, media and endless other sources) and this is downloaded and processed to become human perception or what I call Phantom Self. What is Phantom Self? It's a program. In fact, a program made up of endless sub-programs knov.rn as human traits and behaviour. This doesn't mean that we - the Lnfinite 'I' - are a program, only that our phantom perception of self and reality is a program which dominate:, what people think, feel, do, don't do, support and don't support and their very concept of what is referred to as self and 'life '. What we call 'life' is a program being perceived by another program - Phantom Self. You will see as the book plays out how this explains so much about the mysteries and apparent contradictions of 'life'. 'Mysteries' tend to evaporate like ice in a fire when you come from this perspective. Phantom Selves are programmed to program other Phantom Selves.

Knowledge is sa id to be 'the sum or range of what has been perceived, discovered, or learned', but how much of what people call their ' knowledge ' was gained first hand from their own unique experience and research? Hardly any - in fact if any, in mo s t cases. People largely perceive what they have been told to perceive, discover what they have been told hai:. been discovered and learn what n they have been told to remember. You hear people say when questioned about some alleged fact or truth that they 'learned it at school' or university and yet those who provided this information which became their perceptions were Phantom Selves that passed through the same programming machine. They accepted the program.ming c;o blindly and totally that they became perpetuator s and promotors of the machine as teachers and academics. The System decides and dictates what is true and not true, what can be taught in 'education' institutions and what is s uppressed and ignored. George Orwell's concept in 1984 of 2 + 2 = 5 is very apt. If your parents tell you from the earliest age that 2 + 2 = 5 and teachers, university aca demics , scientists, media and your peers who have been th.rough the same programming tell you 2 + 2 = 5, then there is an excellent chance that you will go through your entire human life believing that 2 + 2 = 5 while in truth it's reall y 4.

'Morning children , welcom e to pri so n' Parent-pump-primed and already developing Phantom Selves (children) leave home every weekday morning from the age of four or five and head for a prison called a 'school'. It's not a prison? So they can stay at home if they want, then? Or they ca.n Jeave when they want? No to both. From their very first day in the prison 'school' an authority figure or figures tell them when to be there, when they can leave, when the y can eat, when they can play (not much and ever less) and even when they can go to the toilet (Fig 26). Developing Phantom Self quickly learru, key lessons of prison school life: 'Truth' comes from authority; intelligence is the ability to remember and repeat; memory and conformity are rewarded; and non-compliance is punished. These le ssons are meant to stay with the Phantom for the rest of its life and they mostly do so under terms like 'respect for authority', 'keep your head down', 'don't rock the boat' and, as they say in Ta pan, 'don't be the nail that stands out above the rest because that's the first one to get hit'. Today this demand for conformity is reaching ever greater extremes with schools dictating more of the child ' s time outside of the school day (see Texas for the cutting edge) and parents being fined £60 per child by UK schools, rising to £120 if u npaid after three weeks, for 'unauthorised absence'. This can rise to £2,500 and involve three months in jail (Fig 27).

We now have Orwellian surveillance and control in schools through camerns, fingerprint scanning for meals and library books, electronic tagging (see Texas again) and fenced-in classrooms that make them look what they are - prisons for the young (Fig 28). These Orwellian controls are being introduced to program children to accept mass and incessant surveillance as normal so they won't resist when the entire world is like that (Fig 29).

This reminds me of my mother who used to tell Jehovah's Witnesses knocking on the door that 'we're Church of England'. We weren't and our family never saw the inside of a church except for weddings and funerals (thank you God). But my mother had sorted out our official spirituality with the holding position of 'we're Church of England.

'Education' is not there to develop freethinking uniqueness, but nodding, unquestioning slaves in mind and body who accept their place for life a!:> powerless cogs in a merciless machine that vampires their energy and creativity. John D, Rockefeller, creator of the General Education Board in 1903, said: 'I don't want a nation of thinkers. I want a nation of workers: A nation of slaves. Then when they can work no more The System spits them out into 'retireme nt' - usually ,1 few years of financial struggle and hardship for most people before the world waves goodbye. Once you can no longer serve with mind and body The System doesn't give a shit what happens to you. Do we regret the pa~sing of a cog in the car transmission? No, we fit ano th er one and so does The System. Humanity is c;een in those terms by their hidden controllers that I expose at great length and detail in other books and later in this one. Physicist Albert Einstein (1879-1955) is a name synonymous with intellect and you hear apparently clever people referred to as 'an Einstein'; but he well understood the myth of 'education'. He said that 'education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school' and 'the only thing that interferes with my l earning is my education'. He said something else highly relevant, too: 'Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.' Phantom Self is specifically constructed to serve The System and b 'educated' (downloaded) on the basis of what serves The System's designs and interests. If you are a fish that can't climb a tree then you are written off, excluded, marginalised and labelled a 'slow learner ' or 'stupid' because The System only wants the tree climber s who are sure to get lost in its forest. Who you are is a secret The System in-point is called birth, the o ut-p oin t is called death, and the bit in the middle is usually known under its alias of 'human life'. The 'education' hoax is crucial to !>ecuring Lifetime compliance of body and mind and deYelopment and moulding of Phantom Self, which is little more than a narrow band of potential awareness that views everyth ing through the blinkered filter of the five senses. Phantom Self reality is largely only what it can touch, taste, hear, see and smell. These 'senses' are illusory constructs of a programmed brain as I will expand upon, but The System doesn't want you to know that. It wants you to serve its interests by perceiving the five-sense 'physical' illusion as the 'real world' and Infinite reality as a figment of deluded imagination when the oppos it e is the case (Fig 30).

Phantom S.,lf flip, once again. Education is therefore focussed on promoting a belief in purely 'physical' reality because this belief will hold your perception in five-sense servitude and slam the door to Infinite Self beyond the program. Academia, as a product and creation of The System, follows and promotes the song sheet of mainstream science and medicine, which is al.so bli ndly repeated and promoted by the mainstream media. 'Mainstream' anything is an agent and vehicle of The System - that's why it is mainstream (Fig 31 ). Most of those who work in this multi- faceted ma i nstream will have no idea that they are agents of a hoax, because they have been through the same mainstream education machine and been programmed by the same Mainstream Everything to the point where they, too, are servants of the hoax and believe in the hoax - which they perceive to be the 'real world' (Fig 32). Anyone that challenge s and exposes the hoax must, by definition, not be accepted in this 'real world' and they are subjected to reflex-action ridicule, dismissal and contempt (Fig 33) . Richard Dawkins, the Oxford University professor to whom anything alternative is a~ garlic to a vampire, encapsulated the arrogance of ignorance when he said: You cannot be both sane and well educated and disbelieve in evolution.

Dawkins appears obsessed with death being the end of everything and gave us this considered insight : 'Don't kid yourself that you're going to live again after you're dead ; you're not.'

Mainstream science is only another religion in disguise and mostly (though not entirely) created by the s ame dose-minded dogma. People like Dawkins castigate and condemn religion while being High Priests of their own - Scientism. Quantum physics has thrown a spanner in all this with the evidence that our reaHty is anything but 'physical', predictable or operating in isolation from consciousness. There are physicists who break the mouJd and rightly contend that consciousness creates matter and not the other way round. Quantum physics alone should demolish Mainstream Everything, but it doesn't because The System won't allow it. Instead, while being forced to reluctantly acknowledge the existence of the non-physical quantum world, Mainstream Everything ignores the fundamental implications of such revelations and cracks on with its promotion of the 'physical' hoax in all its forms. A review of a Dogma Dawkins book reported that he doesn't believe that reality is malleable (quantum physics dearly shows that it is) while at the same time the esteemed professor said that his grasp of quantum physics was 'a bit foggy' and so 'declines to delve very far into that topic' . This is a classic of its kind. I can protect my belief system so long as l never read anything that would question my belief system. 'You found something ?' 'Yes.' ' Where is it?' 'Over there.

This is the reason, in my view, why Dawkins has launched so many attacks through television documentaries and other platforms on alternative explanations of reality and methods of healing. l sense that somewhere deep in his psyche he is seeking to convince himself as much as his audience that challenges to his dogma have no validity. Unfortunately for his considerable ego, they do. Dawkins also, again classically, equates intelligence with being 'weU educated' and, in turn, links 'well educated' with being sane, as with 'You cannot be both sane and well educated and disbelieve in evolution.' This is another way of saying that 'sane' and 'well educated' can only apply to those who believe what he believes.

I'll be explaining this in detail later. As I began this book, a group of real scientists genuinely pursuing answers announced that experiments strongly suggested that ' the world only exists when we look at it'. This should have been banner headlines given its monumental potential consequences for human life at every level, but it was barely reported and even then wit hout fanfare. The 'why' of this is simp l e: Would a sys tem of perception control use its institutions to reveal information with the potential to end its perception control? Would prison warders tell their charges how to break out of their cell? Apply this to education and the question is the same: Why would those behind education want fully informed people when that wou ld break the spell that holds them in slavery to The System that controls education? Hence, education is not there to enlighten and inform in the deepest sense bu t to program perceptions which fuse together to form Phantom Self. Note that l say those behind education because everyone else involved, from teachers to esteemed professors, are themselves prod ucts of the hoax doing the bidding of the hoax. They are both inmates and warders who can't see the prison they administer and perpetuate. It's hysterical , really, when you see the world for what it is. Downl oa din g c ompli anc e Programming is regularly checked to confirm that you are conceding your uniquenes s to The System and Phantom Self through countless education tests and examinations , in which you are asked to repeat what The System has told yo u to believe. In another colossal inversion you are deemed a success if you pass the exams to confi rm your 'degree' of programming, but you a re cons idered a failure if you don ' t Incentives and rewards (more hoaxes) are offered to encourage compliance and these include the fact that many jobs and professions are the domain of exam-passer s only.

Pushy parents (a form of child abuse in my view) se ek to choose and dictate their children's life-path as they outrageously manipul,1te guilt and desire for accep tance to pressure their chil dren into The System's lair . After all , it's what they have been programmed to do. They treat their kids not as an expression of Infinite Awareness, but as an appendage and extension of themselves and the face they put to the wor ld. 'My' child went to a good schoo l and got good grades . Oh, welJ done you, so you passed their exams then? They then play the guilt card to dictate the child's chosen profession and this can scar the child for life. r have met pe ople in their 60s who were still racked with guilt because they had 'let their parent s dovn1 ' by not being what they wanted them to be. If parents want to do some thing l et them do it, but children are their own uniqueness and not a trinket of those who had sex to bring them into the world. This goes both ways with parents not having to be what their children insist they should be. 'Oh, mum, you can't do that- it's embdirassing.' When it comes to Phantom Selves, programming does t en d to go both ways. Respect for individual uniqueness and people being individually unique keeps The System awake at night and so uniqueness is incessantly discouraged and legislated against.

There is no 'at that time' about it. This is what has always happened and still does.

Morpheus in The Matrix movie encapsulated this theme when he said: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see?

This is exactly what they do in so many and various ways. We are looking at a collective form of Stockholm syndrome:' A psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and have positive feelings towards their captures, sometimes to the point of defending them.' We see this all the time with human slaves defending The System which holds them in slavery. As the saying goes ... 'They piss on us and we say it's raining.' Stockholm Syndrome is the stablemate of cognitive dissonance defined here by psychiatrist and philosopher, Frantz Fanon: Sometimes people hold a core belief Lhat is very strong. When thev are presented with evidence that works against that belief , the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a ieeling that is extremely uncomfortable , called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the corl' belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anythin g that doesn't fit in with the core belief. Stockholm Syndrome and cognitive dissonance are a devastating combination when it come to free thought and perception. The world is ruled - at least officially - b y politicians (System programs) and they decree laws based on The System's version of reality. This is reported and supported by the media (System programs) who tell the story in line with their System perceptions. Most agents of Mainstream Everythin g are not knowingly misleading and perpetuating the Lie - that is the domain only of the few . Far more often they are misleading the masse s because they themselves have been misled. Most are slaves every bit as much as those they help to enslave. They ma y have money and apparent prestige but they're still slaves to The Program . Society app ears to be diverse with different political parties and labels, apparent competition and uniforms - everything from dark suits to pit helmets - but this is more illusion and deceit. What appear to be differences and diversity are all operating within the rules and limit ations of the same System.

This is not so remarkable when these perceptions and beliefs have been instilled every day since they left their mother's womb and especial ly since they first stepped into the psychiatric prison that is hysterically known as education. Generation after generation Phantom Selves pour off the conveyor belt to fill posts that administer society and tell the Phantom Self masses what to do and think, just as The System tells tliem (Fig 39). Blind leads the blind, programmed lead s the programmed. This is 'h uman society'; this is the realm of Phantom Self (Fig 40) .

Each generation conditions the next generation, with both leaders and led ultimat ely slaves of an unseen force directing from the shadows.

Not everyone fits this mould of fully-programmed Phantom Self, but the vast majority do and this will continue until humanity awakens to the hoax and its own Infinite nature. Leader s and led, ' bosses' and 'worke rs' are deceived by the hoax and controlled by either the carrot or the stick. The carrot is 'success', or at least survival, and if that do es n't work the stick comes out. Essential to successfully dangling this carrot is to project all perceived 'good' thing s and better things into the illusory 'future'.

Even most of the perceived s ucc essf ul people, the 'winners', reach the stage ot self-reflection (though many won't openly admi t it) because there is no Nirvana for Phantom Self, only the iUusion of one. The emptiness that people still feel despite money, status, tr ophy wife and perceived achievemen t is from living the Lie since they entered the world . They feel empty within because they have lost touch with their 'w ithin ' - the magnificence of their Infinity which the program set out from the start to sile nce.

And you don't feel very different from what you always felt. And there's a slight let down because you feel there's a hoax. And there was a hoax. A dreadful hoax. They made you miss everything. We thought of life by analogy with a journey, with a rilgrimage which had a serious purpose at the end and 1he thing was to get to that end.

Or, as Mark Twain said: 'It is easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled' (Fig 42). Some will enjoy their live:, as a Phantom Self although they have no compass with which to judge and compare life as it could be with influence of Infinite Self. There are many caught by Phantom fakery (virtually everyone to some extent) who <;till have moment:, and even longer periods when insight and perspective of Infinite Self flood their perceptions. People call this anything from inspired intuition to a spi ritual or divine experience. Themes I have described, however, are largely omnipotent in the Phantom realm of the soulless System ('soulless'= the exclusion of Infinite reality). Social media and the Int erne t in general have allowed us to witness the astonishing ~cale and depth of Phantom Self and its ability to spew out programmed stupidity, hatred and mind-blowing ignorance, but it doesn't have to be like that. We don't have to concede our Infinite uniqueness to a manufactured sense of self - and when we stop doing so the prison shaJ I be a paradise or, at the very least, comparatively so (Fig 43).

Chinese philosopher Confucius said: 'Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance' and Greek philosopher Socrates said: 'The only true wisdom is knowing you know nothing.' Another variant is: ' Wisdom tends to grow in proportion to awareness of one's own ignorance .' To divert the target population from such wisdom and ensnare perception in Phantom Self, ignorance must be repackaged and called intelligence and cleverness. This is the prime inversion from which all others come - and can be dearly seen in the collective inversion that is human society . The System is a pig with a lipstick, dressed up as the cutting edge of human 'evolution' when it is nothing more than a madhouse, lunatic asylum, a downloaded app from Looney Tunes (Fig 47). Indeed [ apologise to pigs and give my condolences to lipstick. It's aJJ inversion and when you begin to emerge from the program you are seen as mad and crazy by mainstream society still imprisoned by the program. Imagine that you grew up in a madhouse and all you had ever known happened within the waUs of the madhouse. With no other point of reference you would consider madness to be 'normaJ' - ignorance to be intelligence. As writer and filmmaker, Alejandro Jodorowsky, put it: 'Birds born in a c age think flying is an illness.' U someone came aJong from outside the madhouse and pointed out that it was a madhouse you would see them as mad or 'not normal' , which is nothing more than your normal, your perception of normaJ, from your life experience ... in tlie madhouse (Fig 48). I have just described humanity and its journey from cradle to grave in a process widely referred to as 'life' and . it has been designed that way to secure the specific outcome of human enslavement to a force we never see. Writer Ellen Goodman provides a definition of madhou~ 'normal' - also known by those in the madhouse as 'success' : ' Normal is getting dressed in dothes that you buy for work and driving through traffic in a car you're still paying for in order to get to the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car and the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it.' Human society really is cuckoo-crazy, but I emphasise again that this doesn't have to be . It doesn't have to be a madhouse.

How can we Uve in the 'real world' when the world isn't real, or at least in the way people believe it to be? This must be the first question, the starting point, of any quest to understand human life, surely? Well, apparently not , because this is so often the last question that people ask and not the first. No wonder humanity is so be ... vildered and confused when the 'solid' reality people think is so real is a monumental , nothing-lik e- it-seems -to-be illusion. We have politics , science, medicine, commerce , media and everything else deciding policy, perception and possibility on the basi::, that the world is solid when it isn't.

In terms of understanding a11ythi11g we're already six-nil down before we've even kicked off. Point num ber one: There is no 'solid', onJy our perception of solid (Fig 50). A human brain processes some 11 million 'sensa tions ' or 'impressions' every second in the form of information that it decodes into images, sound, sig ht, smell, taste and feeling or touch; but these 11 million are filtered down to around 40 from which our sense of reality is constructed. Every minute 2,400 impressions are taken from a possible 660 milli on - so imagine what that would be in a day. We appear to see a searnJess reality from these fragments because the brain fills in the gaps with what it belieues should be there.

A physicist would seem to be in another world to a native shaman but open-minded scientists, shamans, mystics and awakening peop le speak the same language. Mexican shaman Don Juan Matus , quoted in the books of Carlos Castaneda, said: We are per ceivers , we are aw areness ; we are not objects ; we have no solidity. We are boundless ... We. or rather our reason , forget this and thus we entrap the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in our lifetime. Another thing about the illusion: Even mainstream science agrees that we only 'see' a tiny fraction of what there is to see - and I mean tiny. The electromagnetic spectrum is said to be as little as 0.005 percent of what is said to exist in the Un iv er se in terms of matter, mass and energy (Fig 51). 'Visible light', the only frequency range we can perceive with human sight, is a fraction of even this 0.005 percent (Fig 52). Some say the electrometric spectrum ratio is a bit bigger , but not much. We don't live 'in' a world as we perceive we do. We live in a frequency band or range which s ome call dimensions or densities and they interpenetrate each other just like analogue radio and television stations operating on different wavelengths while sharing the same 'space' (Fig 53).

Scientist Isaac Newton appropriately coined the term 'spectrum' from the Latin word meaning 'apparition or phantom' (hence 'spectre ' ). Colours are, like everything in our reality, information carried by particular frequencies wruch the brain and the other receiver-transmitting systems of Body-Mind decode into what we appear to see. An 'object' is not a particular colour or colours, and the illusion of this is created by which frequencies (colours) are reflected or absorbed. We don't see what is absorbed and we ucsee what is reflected. We are decoding these reflected frequencies when we say 'that is blue' or 'that is red'. We can on ly see reflected light and while we may appear to see a landscape, house or chair we are actually seejng onJy the light that is reflected from them.

The Universe is like a gigantic computer / Internet system based on encoding and decoding information and there is a good reason for this - we live in a massively more sophisticated version of a computer simulation (Fig 54). Our five- sense reality is a quantum computer with almost unimaginable potential for processing information. Computers that we use are encoded into binary digits (known as 'bits ' ) represented by 1 and O or on-off electrical states. Quantum computer~ employ qua11t11m bits (' qubits') which use atoms, photons or electrons etc., to store and process information. Quantum computers can operate in multiple states simultaneo u sly (not onJy 1 or 0) and so they are millions of times more powerfu l than even today's :,upercomputers . Consider the potential, therefore, of a quantum computer on the sca le of the Universe for information processing. Quantum physicists are realising that all matter (concentrated energy) is a form of computer , but in fact all energy can compute information because it is consciou s. The Universe is not only a computer of extraordinary power, it is a conscious computer. Everything is conscious in ~ome form. I have been saying for many years that the body is a biological computer or living computer - a quantum computer in other word:,. A definition of biological is ' of, relating to, cau s ed by, or affecting life or living organisms '. A biological computer has consciousness and can think for itself up to a point - as the immune system does all the time, making decisions on how to respond to changing circumstances.

They come and go, live and die. Eterna l lnfinite Self is Awareness, the state of being aware (Fig 55). We are points of attention within Infinite Awareness which is lnfinite Everything - all thought, feeling, knowing, potential, possibility, aware11ess - and this has been known by endless names through the ages (including, of course , God). I prefer the term All T1rnt ls, Has Been And Ever Can Be . At first sight this description seems ridiculous . How can you be all that is, has been and can be? But this is only another way of saying All Possibility and rightly so because Infinite Awareness is All Possibility. Near-death experiencer Anita Mootjani ~ author of Dyi11g to be Me, said of the out-of-body realms: 'When we are not expressing in our physical body, you and I and aU of us ... we are all expressions of the same consciousness.' What we call Creation and the realms of form and illusory physicality are Infinite Awareness experiencing itself. Albert Einstein said: 'Everyone who is seriously involved in the p u rsuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe - a spirit vastly superior to that of man.' Max Pl anck (1858- 1947), the German theoretica l physicist behind quantum theory, made a similar point All matter originates and exists , only by virtue of a force. We must assume behind this force is the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter. Mainstream religion mocks or condemns anyone suggesting that we are 'God' , to use that mis l eading term. We are to ld to believe that we are inferior, subordinate, sinners that must worship 'God' when , in fact, we are a point of attention within 'God' as 'God ' experiences itself ; but this 'God' is not the 'God' of religion - it is Infinite Awarene ss"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":".. / ' \\ ' 36 Figure 56: Phantom Self or Infinit e Awareness - il's just Figure 57: Awarene-;s - from a pinhead to infinitv a different perception. with Infinite points of attention that can be anything from myopic to All-Knowing.

DMT is a naturaUy­ occurring component of the metabolism of mammals and plants. Ayahuasca can have many effects, nice and not so nice, and can free you from five-sense awareness to experience far more expanded states. This happened to me over five incredible hours. DMT stimulates the pineal gland in the centre of the br,1jn, which is part of the decoding !>ystem known as the 'Third Eye' and can connect us to realities beyond the reach of the five senses (Fig 59). Pineal glands are only about the size of a grain of rice and look a bit like a pine cone. This symbol has been used for the pineal gland by many cultures and can be seen in the enormous pine cone that dominates the Courtyard of the Pinecone in the Vatican (Figs 60 and 61). Pineal glands are crystalline, as are DNA molecules and the body and genetic structure'-, because they are all receiver-tran!>mitters of information. There are even military radios that exploit the ability of bones to transmit <.ound. Every cell membrane is a liquid crystal and we have tens of trillion<. of cells. What do they use in commurucation technology? Crystals. Ancient standing .. tones and circles were made with crystalline rock because they were a means of receiving and tran�mitting information between their builders and the 'gods' or other frequency bands of reality. Ayahuasca is known as the 'plant of the gods' for the same reason. It can open the mind to see 'the gods' (non-human entities) in other realms of fre quency.

Quality of experience is what matters, not quantity, and this one gave me so much both immediately and in further researching information I was given that night. I lay on the floor in a round wooden structure in the forest for about an hour before the effects of the ayahuasca began to kick in. A loud and powerful voice began to speak in my mind. It took a female form (with a hysterical sense of humour) and the illusory nature of physical reality was explained to me. 'David,' the Voice began, 'we are going to take you to where you come from so you can rem embe r who you arc.' My awa reness was immediately taken to a realm of indescribable bliss where I was pure consciousness. There was no form, no time, no division. All wa s one seamless co nsciousness in whkh I was everything and everything was me. There was no point where 1 ended and everything else began . I was ~If-aware a., d 'me' (a point of attention called David kke) but al.so collectively aware - infinitely aware you might :.ay - as a point of attention withjn the Infinite Whole.

The word~ were repeated many times - 'Infinite Love is the only truth -everytlri11g else u. illu~ion'. l experienced this infinite state as silence when the Voice wasn't speakjng, and as either stillness or sometime!) waves moving in seriom, slow motion. There was pure harmony with no polarities or divisions and although it appeared as a sort of blackne!,s it someh ow shone vvith e norm ouo; vibrancy. Others who have experienced thi~ state de~cribe much the same thing - a 'Dazzling Darkness' as one near-death experiencer described it. This was Dr Eben Alexander, an academic neurosurgeon at Harvard for 15 years, who by his own adrnisi,ion could not have been a more unquestioning advocate of mainstream 'science' and its belief that co nsciousness came from the brain. Then his brain shut down during a nea r-d eath experience in 2008 but his awareness continued neverthel ess. He describes in his book Proof tf Heaven what he calls 'The Core' or 'Dazzling Darkness' from where the pure!)t love emanated and all is known (Fig 62). This is the Infinite in awareness of itself, a state of awareness that knows it is the All TJ,at I:; A11d Ever Can Be, All Potential, All Po ss ibility. One of the terms used through the centuries to describe the Dazzling Darknes!> is the 'Void'. From here all 'C reation ' and form i.i; made manif ec;t as the Infinite experiences it~lf.

Different names and labeb make us lose sight of this unity just as \\Ve speak of the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Indian Oct•an when they are alJ the same body of water. 'Love' as in Infinite Love does not have the same meaning as the illusory love that humanity talks about. Humanity 's perception of love is overwhelmjngly describing an electro-chemical attraction; or what I call 'Mind Love'. Those who have been involved in government-military mind control programme,:; have told me how two people who would otherwise have no attraction can be made to fall madly in 'love' purely by stimulating certain chemkals in the brain. We are told that love never dies and in term!> of Infinite Love that is true; but how often do those attracted by Mind Love walk away from each other with the attraction long gone and onJy acrimony to c:;how for it? lnfinHe Love is far closer to always-there friendship than head-over-heels temporary 'love'. Infinite Love just is. It doesn ' t have a set of conditions. It doe sn ' t even have to like what you do. It loves because it is love. We have to use terms like unconditional love to indicate the difference between Mind Love and love in its Infinite sense which is the harmony and balance of all things , all forces. Humanity has been sys tematically disconnected from this ,;tate of Infinite Love for reasons and through means that will become clear. This is why the world is as it is, but we can reconnect whenever we make that choice. I will refer to the realms of form as 'Creation' in contrast to the All Tllat ls or Dc1221ing Darkne ss which is the source of that Creation through its infinite points of attention. Creation is not all the work of the Dazzling Darkn ess in awareness of itself saying: 'Let there be light and there was light' (I'll put that into another context later, anyway). Expressions of Infinite Awareness whid, are not aware of their own infinite nature also create worlds or simulated worlds. Someone designing a house or car is still using creative imagination to do so as an expression of lnfinite Imagination. Only the scale of awareness and potential to manifest is different. An adult can do brain surgery but a child can't becau~e it does not have the l:>ame awareness. A child does, however, have the potential to expand its awareness until it can do brain surgery. The relationship is the same between the All That Is in awareness of itself and human s in awareness only of being human. A perception of being human is only a temporary experience by expressions of Infinite Awareness - you, everyone . Phantom Self is a state of strictly limited awarenei.s which ha s been tricked into believing that it is the experience , when it is really Infinite Awareness luwi11g that expe rience. l explained in the opening chapter ome foundations to how the trick works , and I will expand on that and what is behind thj.:; manipulation - cmd why. For now it is enough to ~ay that humanity is living out a false identity by confusing who they are with what they are experic11ci11g - their name, race, culture, religion, family history. The Voice asked me as I experienced Infinite reality: ' Do you feel any frustration or anger in this place ?' l did not. 'Do you have any worries or fear or guilt where you are now?' No, there was only harmon y, peace , love and bliss. 'Frus tration, anger, fear , guilt and pain are only illusions, figments of disconnected mind,' the Voice continued. 'T hey don't exis t except in your imagination.'

Do you rhink the Infinit e is feeling nauseous now? So you must be identifying with your body.

If your body does not exist how can nausea or pain? 1 think it is fair to say with historic understatement that human perception and Jnfinjte Perception do not see the world the same way. We live in a simulation When r returned from Brazil and the 'Voice' in 2003 I began to research what I had been told over those five hour s or more. I realised that o ur reality is actually a hi ghly advanced fonn of computer s imulation li ke that portrayed in Tire Matrix and thi s will make so much more sense of the 'worJd' (Fig 66). I saw that even the c utting edge of mainstream science had established the 41 Figure 66: The world we thml.. is ·out 1here ' is actually a ~imula tio n which we decode into the reality we daily experience. lt\"s i~ all happening 'in here ' - within our decoding processes . illusory nature of reality, but the in stitution of science is so fragmented, with each discipline up its own arse, that these revelations were largely ignored in the hope they would go away. Quantum physics - the study of the unseen energetic levels from which our illusory 'physical' world is manifested - has demolished the foundations on which mainstream science has been based and they are still doing their best not to acknowle dge that. 'Laws of physics' are only the encoded rules and limitations of the sim ulation or 'game' and they only operate within the sim ulation . Expand your aware ness to beyond the game and you transcend the game and its encoded limitation. What then happens are called 'miracles', but they are not miracles. There are no miracles, only more expanded understanding of how everything works. The Voice in Brazil told me that the human laws of physics were illu sory 'laws' to measure an illusory universe. 'Do you think the Infinite needs 'laws' through whjch to express itself?' the Voice asked. There were no laws of anything, only perceptions of them. Laws and limitation were only a belief in laws and limitation , the Voice said, and this is clearly true.

What you believe you perceive and what you perceive you experience. I have been writing and sayi ng for a long time that we live in a simulation or 'Matrix-type' world and my own research and sources are increasing ly supported by those mainstream scientists who express a sp irit of true exploration rather than song sheet worship. Reports have now even begun to appear in the mainstream media here and there. Physicists at the University of Bonn in Germany have said they may have evidence that the Universe is a computer simulation and the y published their findings in a paper h eaded 'Co nstraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation'. They highlight the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cut-off which is a barrier for cosmic ray particles caused by interaction with cos mic background radiation and they say that thb ' pattern of constraint' is precisely what you would find with a computer simulation. Like a prisoner in a pitch-black cell we would not be able to see the 'walls' of our prison, the team says, but 'through physics we may be able to identify them'. Simulations can have their own 'laws of physics' in the same way that computer games operate to the rules dictated by the writer of the program. Answers to questions about how something is possible can so often be answered by 'c lick, click, enter' - simply the way the simulation has been written. I have long co ntend ed in my books that the outer 'wa ll' of the simulation is what scientists call the speed of light (officially 186,282 miles per second). Albert Einstein said this was the fastest speed possible but I strongly beg to differ. There can be no fastest speed within All Possibility for a start and the speed of light is pedestrian compared with what happens outside the simulation. Reality and 'time' go haywire close to the speed of Light because we are then approaching the limits of the simu l ation and entering a realm with very different 'laws of physics' (Fig 68). Time is only an encoded program within the simulation and starts to warp when you reach the outer Hmits of that program. Consciousness beyond the five se nses can override the limitations of th e simulatio n and this often happens in dreams when we can fall off a cliff or some thing and no one dies. Do the same within the program and you do 'die', or at least the body does, because that is the way the program is written to hijack perception in a state of limitation. A belief in the speed of light a~ the limit of possibility can keep you entrapped in the program as your sense of r ea lity becomes your experienced reality. Most people believed that no one could ever run a mile in under four minutes, but once Roger Bannister achieved that by a fraction of a second in 1954 others began to do the same and better. This is the same principle . Figure 68 : Tiie Ma1nx operates ton the level we perceive) within lh P speed of lighL By 2015 the world record for the mile was neaily 17 seco nds below four minutes. Near-death experiencers find themselves in a totally different reality with different 'laws of physics' when their awareness wi thdr aws from the body - withdraws the point of attention from the sense of limitation specifically programmed into our 'physica l' (Matrix simula tion ) reality . Phantom Self, or five- sense self, is subject to these Limitations because it is part of the same program, a~ Pl 01 cc tl- :vi tr aJ if."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"- ...

When this happens the resulting 'miracles' are often dismissed a~ a piece of trickery- 'things like that can't happen'. How often such words spew forth from Phantom Self, which is attached to the sim ulation and so believes in its programmed laws and rules. There is Phantom Self trickery and illusion - as with magicians - but the Infinite Se lf does not require that to transcend limitation when it is All Tl1at I i, And £vet Can Be . Oxford professor Nick Bostrom has also said that our world could be a computer sim ulation and calculated the 'co mputationaJ requirements' on which it would be constructed. Bo!>trom is also a proponent of transhumanism - the fusing of humans with technology - and I will have much to say about this. It is vital for people to appreciate the magnitude of human co ntrol that transhumanism represents. We now hav e tec hnology that basically mirrors the simulation in the form of virtual reality games that can convince the player:. their virtual world is real (Figs 69 and 70). We have virtual reality trainin g including pilot training, and movie simulations that are getting ever closer to this-world real (Figs 71 and 72).

Phantom Self at the forefront of virtuaJ reality development say it won't be that long before virtual realities are produced which will be indistinguishable from our 'real world' (simulation). Silas Beane with the University of Bonn team said: The idea is that in future, humans will be able to simulate entire universes quite easily. And given the vastness of time ahead, the number of these simulations is likely to be huge . So if you ask the question: 'Do we live in the one true reality or in one oi the many simulations?, the answer, statistically speaking, is that we're more likely to be living in a simulation. James Gates, the John S. Toll Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland and Fl ts Di rector of The Center for String and Particle Theory, is another mainstreamer exploring bell evidence that we live in a simulation. He said in a Physics World article in 2012 that vib evidence is indeed there to suggest that our reality is something dose to the Matrix anc movie series . Gates detailed how his team had uncovered equations in the fabric of the aw Universe which include embedded computer codes of digital data that take the form of vib 1 a11d O - the binary system of on-off electrical charges used by computers. He agreed the that 'nature' can be reduced to equations found in computer coding and that finding in~ these codes supported the view that we live in a simulation. Gates also revealed that ex1 they had discovered sequences which are the same as mathematical sequences known to J as error-correcting codes or block codes embedded in computers and other electrical !>iD technology. These return or reboot data to its original state if something changes or inf interferes with it during transmission. Gates said that he didn't know what they WC're tlu doing in the make-up of our reality, but I suggest they are part of the software that du ensures the simulation remains in situ when other data and sources of information pei threaten its stability. These error-correcting codes are connected to the apparent ert1 limitation (walls of the Matrix) that is called the speed of light. Max Tegmark, a de physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MlT), says the Universe is a as mathematical structure 'just like a cube, or a tetrahedron' and is 'entirely des1..·ribed by prl numbers and maths, just as a video game is encoded. Tegmark, author of Our wi Mathematical Universe, makes the point that the physics of computer games and our Inl world are basically the same: col gli Suppose you are a character in Minecraft or some much more advanced computer game where of the graphics are really good and you don't think you're in a game. You feel that you can bump in into real objects and you can fall in love and get excited about stuff. And when you start inJ studying the physical world in this video game, eventually you start discovering that, wow, fo1 everything is made out of pixels, and all these things that I used to think were 'stuff' are actuall y wl just described hy a bunch of numbers.

And we're exactly in this situation in our world. We look around and it doesn't see m that mathemati cal at all, but everything we see is made out of elementary particles like quarks and electrons. And what properties does an electron have? Does it have a smell or a colour or a texture? No! As far as we can tell the only properties an electron has are - 1, 1/2 and 1. We physicists have come up with geeky names for these properties, like electric charge, or spin, or lepton number, but the electron doesn't care what we call it, the properties are just numbers .

These waves and vibrations are encoded information and the human Body-Mind decodes this information into the world that we experience as physical (Fig 74). I'll come to how it does this in a moment. The sim ulation is interactive. We decode information from the information fields that we call the Universe and we aJso change the Universe by posting our own perceptions through thought and emotion (information). For this reru.on I describe the Universe - the s imuJation - a~ the 'Cosmic Internet' (Fig 75). The principle is the same, especially with wireless communication. Wireles s Internet information may appear on your computer screen as image s, words, graphics and video, but do you see any of those things flying around the room or in your computer tower? Thjs information is in the room, yes, but in the form of unM?en information fields (Wi-Fi) which the computer decodes into images, words, graphics and video.

Phantom sen information from the un see n Cosmic Internet into the 'seen' world of the conscious five-sense mind. The Universe in its foundation state can be likened very accurately to Wi-Fi fields of information which we are decoding and encoding (Figs 76 and 77). We live within an energetic 'sea' of information - the simulation or Matrix. What is called the World Wide Web only exists in the form we perceive when the computer decodes information onto the screen and our 'physical' reality onJy exists in the form that we perceive when the brain decodes information onto its 'screen'. There is no 'out there' - the 'out there' is only illusion . Pt.>ople often ask that if we create our own reality as I say we do, then how come we all see the sa me landscap e, house or car? We are all decoding the same background information fields, the c:;a m<.' information construct, but not necessarily in the same dNail ,1nd with the s,1 me perception. How do we know what other-; are seeing? They may see the same basic backdrop (decode the Cosmic Internet) but information we choose to decode and what we think of what we 't:,ee' can be very different. How often we hear people say of those with a different perception of the same thing- 'What planet are you on?' What planet are you decoding and perceiving would be more lik~ it. Remember , too , that while the brain is receiving 11 million 'l:>E.'nsations' or 'impressions' (pieces of information) every second it constructs our sense of visual reality from ju st -10 while filling the gaps with what it thinks should be there. Are ,,ve really saying that every brain is going to fill those gaps in the exactly s ame way? An observer'._ sense of reality is also going to dictate what is decoded and what is made of that - as in g la ss half empty or half full. Now, something that will become very relevant later: You can program a compu ter to decode information in a particular way and to decode some information and ignore the rest. Body-Mind is a biological computer that can be programmed to do the same . If you wanted to control humanity en masse is thb not what you would do? Of course you would - and they have. The program is Phantom Self. Lost in the role Body-Mind is designed to directly interact with the simulation and this is the vehicle through which our expression of Infinite Awarene ss - what some call the 'Soul' or superconsciousness - can ex perience and interact with thi5 reality . 'Soul' resonates to a much higher frequency than the simulation that we 'see' and in its purest Infinite state i5 beyond frequency and vibration. 'Soul' could not pick up a fork or drive a ca r in the same way that the frequency of radio station A cannot interact (interfere) with radio station B when they are on very different wavelengths. Etem.il Soul overcomes this frequency di spa rity by transferring it s point of attention into the biological computer of Body-Mind through which it can directly interact with the sim ulation .

Phantom Self is an actor who is so confused that he thinks hi s fictional character is really him and this confusion is enco uraged and manipulated for reasons and by forces that I will reveal. How apt that the word 'person' comes from persona or 'actors mask' in Latin (Fig 78). You could think of someone sitting at the computer with the keyboard and mouse as symbolic of the figure 79: When the computer is disconnec ted trom the operator and goes its own way the greater perspective oi reality is lost. The computer world is all that appears to exist. Soul and the computer as Body-Mind and the five se n ses (Fig 79). Ima gine the computer losing contact with the 'so meone' and d eci ding itself where to go on th e Int e rnet and what to do. This is the dynamic I am talking about betwe e n 'Soul' and Body-Mind Phantom Self. We are m e ant to be si multaneousl y aware on multiple levels so we are in trus world (Body-Mind) but not of it (Soul) with th e two working in conscious harm o ny to exchange information and insight. The mor e we expand our awareness the more points of attention we become aware of- 'I could be anywhere I wanted to be simultaneously', as the near - death experiencer s aid. The System is specifica lly s tructured to disconnect Body-Mind from the influence and insight of Soul to isolate perception, attention and awareness in Bod y-Mi nd, which then becomes a Phantom Self unaware of its Tnfinite Self. The following is all accepte d by the scie ntific mainstream although its fundamental implication s for understanding reality are la rg ely i gno red : Our five se nses of sight, hearing, touch, s mell and taste d ecode waveform information (what I would call the ' Wi-Fi' Cosmic Internet) into electrical information which is then communicated to the brain to be decoded into th e digital 'phys ical world' tha t we think we 'see' (Fig 80).

They are packets of 49 energetic information that are part of the decoding process, that's all. Everything in our reality is information being encoded and decoded. What is the Universe? Information. In the case of the 'physical' Universe it is decoded information in the s ame way that a computer is information decoding software i!nd Internet information. (Fig 84). F ive-s ense illusion The five senses are decoding systems that turn waveform information into electrical information, which they communicate to the brain - or at least that is a simp le way of explaining the process of manifestation. There is a major rider to this, which I will expla in at the end of the chapter. Virtual reality games hijack the five se n ses by sending information to the sight, sound and (through gloves) touch se nse s. They use the same decoding sys tem through which we create 'normal' reality , but communicate different information. My goodness, how this is going to be so relevant later. Ears decode waveform information and transmit it to the brain to be decoded into so und. Anything that prevents this information reaching the brain in the correct form or stops the brain decoding it wiU cause the person to be deaf . We hear words when people speak, but only when the fields of vibrating information generated by the vocal cords have been decoded into words by the brain. Words do not pass between us, only vibrational information fields. Words come courtesy of the brain which can be programmed to decode different vocal cord information in different ways and we caU the se different languages. Music is a perfect example of waveform information decoded into sou nd by the brain. A music concert is a mass of waveform information from vocal cords, strings and drums decoded by the brain into the form that we 'hear'. Music can also be expressed as ma thematical codes. We only feel pain when a blow on the knee is transmitted electrically to the brain to be decoded into 'o uch '. Method s of pain relief used today include blocking this communication, becau se if the brain does n ot decode the message we cannot feel the pain .

Chemical 'taste enhancers' such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) are added to what passes for food to trick the brain into decoding taste that isn't really there. Different parts of the brain specialise in decoding information from different senses and our entire visual reality springs forth from a few cubic centimetres at the back of the brain. Yep, physical reality is real all right. A scene in Tile Mafrix when Morpheus was explaining the illusion of physica li ty was based on fact: What is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. That's all it is- this 'Real World'. A brain sits in pitch black darkness encased by the skull and only 'sees' light by decoding electrical information delivered from the sight senses. Philosopher and mystic Allan Watts was right when he said: ... !Without the brain I the world is devoid of light, heat, weight, solidity, motion, space. time or any other imaginable feature. All these phenomena are interactions, or transactions, of vibrations with a certain arrangement of neurons. It's not just the brain, either. The whole genetic and body structure is invo lved in the reality-decoding process and this includes the receive r -transmitter system known as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and the central nervous system. An Internet artide described DNA very well: From the characteristic form of this giant molecule - a wound double helix - the DNA represents an ideal electromagnetic antenna. On one hand it is elongated and thus a blade which can take up very well electrical pulses. On the other hand, seen from above, it has the form oi a ring and thus is a very magnetical antenna. DNA is also a software program as an article in the San Francisco Chronicle pointed out: 'DNA is a universal software code. From bacteria to humans, the basic instnictions for life are written with the same language.' DNA consists of four (biological computer) codes known as A, C, G and T, and the relationship between them decides if the holographic form is a virus, a mouse or a human (Figs 85 and 86). Only small differences can produce vastly different forms. Body-Mind in its entirety is a software program designed to interact with the overall software program of the simu lation or Matrix. This is the realisation that makes sense of our crazy world and the nature of Phantom Self . Body-Mind software is programmed only to visually decode the tiny freguency range called visible li ght to focus and isolate our perceptions in five-sense reality at the expense of a conscious connection to Infinite Awareness. I will be addressing the whys and wherefores of this and in doing so unravel the mys teries of human society. Scientific naivety about DNA is such that up to 98 percent has been dubbed 'junk DNA' because they don't know what it does and conclude therefore that it must have 110 fi111ctio11.

Humans can 'talk ' to animals and plants th r ough this same DNA frequency interaction.

They obviously don't do this by knowing human la nguage but by gleaning a feeling or impression from the information fields whjch they d ~ode in their own way. People get a good or bad feeling from a song even if they can't m ake out the words. Experiments with electrically-wired plants have shown that they react positively and negatively to words of kindnesc; and abuse , and recognise an abuser wh en they re-enter the room. We can heal (balance) ourselves and make ourselves ill (imbalance) through words, thoughts and visualisation (concentrated thought) through th e vibrational impact . Electrical I energetic healing devices (genuine ones) work in the sam e way and so does 'hands-on' healing through an exchange of energy (frequency I vibration I information). Molecular biologist Pjotr Gatjajev and his colleagues say that: 'Living chromosomes function just like solitonic/holographic computers using ... DNA laser radiation.'

He described how his father had a party for friends and invited a stage hypnotist to entertain the guests. At one point a man called Tom was sitting in a chair in a hypnotised state. Tom was told that when he re turn ed to a waking state he wouJd not be able to see his daughter in the room. His daughter was then asked to stand in front of her father as he awakened from the trance. Tom was asked if he could see his daughter. No, he said, even thoug h he was lo oking into her belly. Next the hypnotist put his hand on the daughter's back and asked Tom if he could see what he was holding . Yes, Tom replied , he was holding a watch. His daughter was standi ng between him and the watch, but he could sti ll see it. Tom was asked if he could read an inscription on the watch and he did. Ask mainstream scientists like Richard 'Dogma' Dawkins to comment on this story and they would lik ely say that either it didn't happen or was so me sort of trick. In fact, it can all be easily explained if you appreciate that ' physical' rea Uty is an illusion . The Universe in its foundation state is wavefo r m information which is decoded into an apparen tl y physical (holographic) form by the brain. This is true of everything including the bod y. We even decode our own body into ho lographic form beca u se the base state of Body-Mind is not what we see but energetic information fields that are decoded into what we tltink we see (Figs 88 and 89). If that decoding process does not happen Body-Mind rema ins only in its energetic state and cannot be i-.cen by the conscious/holograph ic mind -yes, even the brain whic h is also energetic in its undecoded form. Everything is energy, but l am using the term 'energetic' here to describe the difference between 'physical' and 'non-physical' states . All of which brings U!> back to the article in a British newspaper th at I referred to earlier headed: 'Your entire life is an ILLUSION' and 'New test backs up theory that the world doesn't exist until we look at it'. Physicists at the Australian Na ti ona l University had found evidence which supported daims made by other quantum physicists that the Universe as we know it only exists when it is obst!rved. l would take it further and put it like this: 'The world doe sn't exis t until we decode it.' Observing or 'looking' is a focus of attention that triggers the decoding process. From this pe rspective Tom's experience with his daughter makes perfect sense.

Or perhaps it's not unfathomable at all. Holographic television syste ms now being developed operate with two-dimensional information observed as three-dimensio n al forms. I saw a video about holographic TV and the voiceover said: And it does look 30 when you sit in front of it [observe it] ... The image is stored on the film or in this case displayed on the screen as an intricate set of interference patterns which only form the image when you view it from the right angle and illuminate ii properly. Other scientific pioneers of the holographic principle of 'p h ysical' reality include quantum physicist David Bohm (1917-1992) and Karl Pribram, Professor Emeritus of Psyd,ology and Psychiatry a t Stanford University and Radford University in the United States. Pribram and Bohm both worked on 'holonomic brain theory', which describes the brain as a holographic storage network. Pribram contends that this involves wave oscillations in the brain that create interference patterns that encode memory. Song sheet 'science' is going to have to face the truth eventually that its foundation beliefs about the nature of reality are tlawed beyond words and measure and we do indeed Live in a computer -like simulation with a holographic 'physical' component. Physicist Nikola Tesla said: 'If you wish to understand the Universe, think of energy, frequency and vibration.' Now holograms should be added to the list. Tim e Control Time and space are information encoded into the fabric of the Universe and when we decode them they appear to us to be real; but they're not. Play a virtual reality game and there will appear to be 'time' (one event or scene fo ll owing another) and space (three- dimensional perspective) and yet the game is onJy decoded information encoded with click, click, enter, when the program was written. Near-death experiencers describe how their out-of-body world did not have tin,e and space in the way we perceive it within what I would call the simulation. A quote from earlier said: l saw everything they were thinking now, what they thought then, what was happening before, what was happening now. There is no time, there is no sequence of events, no such thing as limitation, oi distance, of period, of place. l could be anywhere I wanted to be simultaneously. Near-death experiencer Anita Moorjani said like so many others that when she 'expanded' out of h er body she could be everywhere 'at the same time'. Our perception of time is relative to the perceiver, observer - decoder. People throughout what we call history have been described as ahead of their time because they knew things and could do things that were thought impossible by their contemporaries.

We can now see why and the gift can be developed by practice given that the simulation is interactive and we can change the way we receive information from the Cosmic lnternct by how we choose to decode it. If you process information very fast or very slow then your experience of 'time' ·will be different. The need for sports players to slow down time to make an accura te shot can be activated by the desire - will - to improve their game and in the same way the need for different species to develop unique gifts and abilities to cope with their changing environment can lead to mutations that are called 'evolution'. Scho l ars reported in the UK Daily Teit'graph claimed that drugs could be used to so distort a prisoner's sense of time that they couJd serve an extremely long sentence (in their perception) in a matter of hours. Team leader Rebecca Roache said: Uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours. This would, obviously, be much cheaper for the taxpayer th,m extending criminals' lifespans to enable them to serve 1,000 years in real time.

Put time and money together and you have pretty much got the human control system. Why can't you do what you want to do? I haven't got the time and I haven't got the money . People say 'time is money' when there is no time and there is no money (exp l ained later). lt is so hard for humanity to grasp the concept of illusory time when we are subjected to that illu sion 24/7 throughout our lifetimes with the five -.en'>ef. constantly telling us that time exists: What's the time? ls that the time? I'm out of time. Where's the time gone? This is all illw,ion when the only time is NOW. There is only the NOW, the Infinite NOW. What about past and future? Where are we when we think about the past? In the NOW. Where are we when we think about the 'future'? In the NOW. Everything happens - and can only happen - in the NOW. Past and future are only perceptions (beliefs) con:.tructed in the NOW. An entire movie exists at the <.ame 'time' on a DVD, but as you watch the <,creen you have the perception of past, present and future in that the scene you are watching appears as the present ; the ones you have watched is your sense of the 'past'; and the ones you have yet to watch are in your perception of the 'fu ture' (Fig 107). Whichever scene you are watching on the DVD it is always in your NOW. The idea that we are 'run out of time' is more illusion . We can't run out of time when there is no time. We make choices about what we do, that 's all. 'la m running out of time and I have to get to so and so' is nothing to do with time. It is only a choice to get to so and ~ at that moment. How often do these illusory past/future perceptions destroy our enjoyment and peace in the NOW through regret and re~nt.ment from the 'past', or fear, desire and foreboding about the illusory future? figure 107: Every ~cene on a DVD is encoded in the salllt' moment the same DVD - but the play· ou1 ,;equence gi11es the illusion of pas1 moving through r~nt to future.

Human society cannot be understood without the realisation that almost everything is inverted or upside down and there are few better examples than the term 'paranormal'. This is defined as 'beyond the range of normal experience or scientific exp lanation'. We are back to the concept of 'normal' again, but normal is only normal from the perception of experiences that people normally have. Whenever we return to 'normal' we must return to the perception of normal because that's all normal is- a perception of reality. Someone living in a house in the middle of nowhere will experience a normal of being alone. When a car passes by this is paranormal, but only to the per.on living in the \"Par, middle of nowhere. To ~omeone with a home in an urban street the passing of vehicles o is their normal while peace and quiet is their paranormal. Phantom Self is programmed to believe in The System's version of normal which demands that we perceive everything through the five senses and beUeve in a world of solidity. When something happens that 'science' can't explain this is labelled 'paranormal' while being perfectly normal once you understand reality. If you think the world is solid mo!>t of the paranormal is impossible and so it's seen as strange and bewildering, condemned as the 'black arts' or dismissed as a figment of deluded imagination. Such responses block any serious inquiry that could lead to a re-evalualion of what is 'normal' and the cycle of ignorance goes on and on. Infinity ca llin g ... I am going to present many examples of the perfectly normal parnnonnal in this chapter and I'll start with psychic phenomena.

Anyone claiming to have psychic gifts is therefore a charlatan or deluded. Tt 's official.

A fundamentill disadvantage for the normal paranormal is that the version of reality pedalled by The System is so purposely distorted and inverted that moc;t people can't understand how the so-called paranormaJ can be possible. This is a major reason why I am writing this book. If you believe the world is solid then psychic happenings make no se nse. I mean, how can you contact the departed when they were pronounced dead and either buried in a coffin or went up in flames? Clearly it's not the former body that is being contacted, but then the body is not 'us'. Body-Mind allow~ 'us' - awarenes s, consciousn ess, point of ,1ttention - to experience the range of frequencies known as human society. When the body ceases to fm,ction the Infinite 'us' withdraws its attention and tran sfe rs it to freq~encies new (Fig 113) . Those left behind can no longer see their departed loved onei, because their now di se mbodied awareness is resonating to higher frequencies beyond the holographic world (think Tom's daughter again). This frequency gap between the 'p hysica l' world and real me:; of 'Soul' can be bridged by genuine psychics and mediums as their awaren ess tunes-in to the higher fre qu e ncy, proc esses that information into human langu age, and delivers the mes sages into the human frequency (Fig 114).

A definition of the word 'medium' is 'an intervening sub:.tance through which something else is transmitted or carried on'. Another form of ' paranormal' inter-frequency communication is known as channelling. A psychic or medium will see or hear information communicated to them, but with channelling the 'channel' allows another awareness to take over their body and vocal processes to speak through them . I have experienced this with many people around the world and some have been almost hilariously bad while others extremely impressive. Like everything, it comes down to gifts and abilities. 1 have witnessed the faces and voices of channels change quite dramatically in some cases as the energetic field of the connecting awareness impacts upon the holographic field of the channel. Body-Mind allowc; awareness in multiple states of consciousness to experience the sanw 'world' (Fig 115); but once awareness withdraws from the body, it can only interact with a frequency band with which it can sync. Some leave the body and gravitate to frequencies of pure awarenei,s without form, while others are still !to attached to the 'p hysical ' and the programming and sensory pull of the 'physical ', that they remain very dose to this reality (Fig 116). They can still lo ok like an energetic copy of their former 'physical' selves through what is called in Tile Matnx 'resjdual self- image ' - their programmed perception s till dominates their sen..c;e of ..,elf and reality and they continue to perceive them.selves as their once 'physical' personality.

Friends and family who are sensitive to their loved-one's frequency-closeness will say things like: 'I can feel him /he r around me all the time.' This is one explanation (only one) for ghosts and apparitions. They are so close to our frequency band that they can 'bleed' through like a form of broadcasting interference (Fig 117). A radio accurately tuned to a radio statio n frequency will produce a clear, sharp reception with no interference, but when the dial is slightly off centre another station or stations can be heard alongside the main one. A 'ghost' is a form of visual interference based on the same principle and a nother ' paranormal' mystery that is easily explained. Ghost or spirit (energy) figure s don't usually look solid because the observer is not on the same frequency , just as broadca s t interference affecting a radio station is not crisp and dear. People are being influenced all the time from other frequencies without realising it. They might have a thought or idea out of nowhere and wonder where it came from. This could be self-generated from their s ubconscious mind , but it can also be communicated telepathically from other frequencies of reality . 1 have been consciously guided and led to infom1ation this way since the days of Betty Shine - 'Sometjme s he will say things and wonder where the y came from' ... 'Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other time s he will be led to knowledge .' Mo ments of ins pired intuition when people say 'I don't know how I know , but I just know ' can also be the r esult of int e r-fr e quency telepathic co mmunicat i on. Genuinely-gifted ps ychics and mediums expand the range of their re ceiver-transmission processes to c onnect with frequencie s that we can't see (Fig 118).

In my view, ayahuasca does not take you to these high frequencies but rather removes the programmed sen . e of limitation which stops you getting there. We are all meant to be doing this without support of drugs and potions. It's our natural state to be mu 1 tidimensional awareness communicating across the frequency scale. We have been manipulated into an unnatural tate of isolation by the hidden force that created and controls The System and our simulated reality. Real McCoy psychics and mediums are receiver-transmitters of information with a frequency range greater than that accessed by the rest of humanity.

Mysteries and 'it's-not-possible' fade away in the wake of simple explanation once reality is understood. Thi s plac e is haunted Ghosts and apparently spooky happenings can be energetic recordings. The Universe is a quantum computer encoding and decoding information and every experience is recorded or po~ted in the fabric of reality. This 'library of everything' is the source of the belief in' Akashic' fields or 'records', where some contend that every thought and event is stored. Akasha is a Sanskrit word meaning 'sky', 'space', 'luminous', or 'aether' and I would liken the term to the 'hard drive' of the quantum computer. I have heard storiei,, over the years of people hearing the sounds of battle at the scenes of ' past ' bloody conflicts, and this can be a quantum computer recording rather than 'real-time' ghostly activity . Witnesse s on the Lc;le of Wight where I live in England claim to have seen a garrison of Roman soldiers marching at night between two ancient Roman sites, but this doesn't mean troops are literally marching in ghostly form. These witnessed experiences can be a powerful recording encoded in the energetic field which tho~e sensitive enough can tune in to. Some people see these things and others don't . Not everyone has the same sensitivity and one person can see or hear something very dearly while someone next to them doesn't. Sensitivity doesn't make you better or more advanced than others. It means you are more sensitive to frequencies outside of visible Light. Wisdom and enlightenmen t is not defined by having psyd,ic experiences , but from what you make of them and what you do as a result.

A recurring theme in ghostly tales is of obj ects moving around an d poltergeists - 'a ghost that manifests i~elf by noises, ra ppings, and the creation of disorder'. A 'physical' object is a holographic projection of en er~etic infor mati on. U yo u manipulate the information you manipulate the lographic projection.

Atmo s ph ere is e le ct ri c ( literall y) Electricity and electromagnetism are all arow1d us, and why would that not be the case in a computer simulation? There are multiple expressions of the Universe and electricity I electromagnetism is one of them along with the waveform, digital and holographic. A gathering branch of alternative science is known as the 'Electric Universe' which researches and uncovers the properties and roles of electricity, magnetism and the interaction of the two - called electromagnetism. These are vehicles for delivering and communicating information, and electromagnetism generates information-encoded waves travelling at the speed of light. Electric Universe research is rewriting the concept of the Universe promoted by Mainstream Everything. Two Electric Universe pioneers are Australian physici st Wallace Thornhill and researcher David Talbott , co-authors of two excellent books , Tlie Electric U11ivcrse and T/11mderl10/ts of tlze Gods. They and other proponents of the electrical nature of the Universe (on one level) have comprehensively rewritten the s kewed assumptions of mainstream scie nce dbout how the Universe works with regard to electricity, electromagnetism and much else. I have introduced a very significant word here - ass11mptio11s. Great swatches of what has come to be accepted as scientific fact turns out to be mere assumptions th.;t have been repeated so often by science, academia and media that they have fused into an 'everyone knows that'. They are only assumptions and often the outcome or headline assumption is founded on a long list of other assumptions. Here are t en of the key assumptions li s ted by researd,er and biologist Rupert Sheldrake in his book Scie11ce Set Free which have (a) become accepted scientific, academic and medfa 'fact' despite being nonsense, and (b) ensure that anyone who believes them will never understand reality: I.

Then came a rather loud noise as an explosion generated temperatures of trill ,oru, of degrees which somehow created sub atomic particles. energy, matter, space an d time, and later planets, stars and Fig ure 12 0: The 'Big Bang' - ' Give us a free miracle and we'll explain th~ rest'. iv erything eh.c. American writer and researcher Terence McKenna captured this lunacy \"lliantly when he said: 'Give uc; a free miracle and we'll explain the rest.' He goes on: Every model o( the universe has a hard swallow. What I mean by a hard swallow is a place where the argument cannot hide the iact that there's something slightly fishy about it. The hard swallow built into science is this business about the Big Bang. Now, let's give this a little attention here. This is the notion that the universe, for no reason, sprang from nothing in a single inst,1nt. Well, no\\\\ beiore we dissect this, notice that this is the limit lest for credulity. Whether you believe th,s or not, notice that it is not possible to conceive of something more unlikely or less likely to be believed! I mean, I defy anyone - it's just the limit case for unlikelihood , that the universe ,,ould spring from nothing in a single instant, for no reason?! - I mean, if you believe th.1t, my family has a bridge across the Hudson River that we'll give you a lease option for five doll,irs! It makes no sense. It is in iact no different than saying, 'And God said, let there be light .' And what these philosophers of science are saying is, give us one free miracle, and we will roll from that point io,ward - from the birth of time to the crack of d()om! - just one free miracle, and then it will all unravel according to natural law, and these bizarre equations which nobody can understand but which are so holy in this enterprise . Big Bang Theory was first postulated in 1927 as the 'hypothesis of the pri m eval atom ' by Georges Lemaitre (1894-1966), a priest at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. Even he never said it was a fact, only a hypo t he.is.

Given the dependency of mainstream scie nce on assumptions, I had to laugh when American media cosmologist, Neil deGra sse Tyson, said: A conspiracy theorist is a person who tacitly admits that they have insufficient data to prove their points. A conspiracy is a battle cry of a person with insufficient data. Fig u re 121 : Plasma is a near-perfect medium for el ec tric ity. This is taking self-de lu sion to shocking extremes whe n you think that mainstream science is another way of saying 'insufficient data'; but Tyson's worship of Mainstream Everything becomes clear in this quote: 'The goo d thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.' Like the Big Bang?? A now mountain of evidence produced by proponents of the Electric Universe have overtu rn ed so many accepted 'facts' (ass umption s) of Big Bang believers like Tyson who appears to contend there are no conspiracies Figure 122: Lightning strikes impact on ma ny level s o ut int o the cos mos. anywhere only insufficient data. The Universe is awash with electricity and elec tromagnetic fields from nano-tiny to spanning great swatches of 'space'. Its working env ironm e nt is plasma which mainstrea m science agrees is a near-perfect vehicle for electricity I electromagnetism. Plasma has been called the fourth state of matter and 99.999 % of the observable Universe is plasma. Everyone will have seen plasma balls which produce lightning-like responses when you touch them (Fig 121 ). Lightning is an obvious express ion of electrical activity in the atmosphere when electricity builds up to the point where it has to be released. Lightning we see from the ground is only part of the story and the same electrical surge continues into the upper atmos ph ere where science gives it names such as 'elves', 'sp rit es', 'gnomes' and 'jets'. A lightning strike plays out into the e lectromagnetic fields of the Cosmos (Fig 122). Tornadoes are fas t-rotating electrica l fields and so appear during elect rical storms. Electricity can also be seen with the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights. When p lasma in one electrical state meets plasma of another electrical state a barrier is created between them known as a LangmuiI Sheath after American Nobel Laureate , Irving Langmuir (1881-1957) who discovered the phenomenon.

ElectricaJ currents are passing through the Universe in the form of filaments of vastly varying size and power. They are known as 'Birkeland currents' after the Norwegian scientis t, Kristian Olaf BirkC'land (1867- 1917) who discovered them. As electricity travels through the plasma another process takes place in which electrical currents create electromagnetism and this, in tum, causes the filaments to rotate around each other while electromagnetic fields keep them apart. This is called the 73 Figure 123: Planetary energy fields or magnelospheres are formed hy Langmuir Sheaths where plasma in difierenl electrical states resist each other.

Brain activity is electrica l and is just one level of the body's communication system. Communication of information electrically is another example of the Cosmic Internet (Fig 126). Electrical sunshine Mainstream Everyt hin g claims that the Sun is a nuclear reactor generating heat and light from its core and will at some point bum itself out; but as the American engineer and Electric Universe researd1er, Ralph Juergens, said: 'The modem astrop hysical concept that ascribes the Sun's energy to thermonuclear reactions deep in the solar interior is contradicted by nearly every observable aspect of the Sun.' This is because the S un is almost entirely plasma (99 percent) and processes electricity from its atmosphere and not from within. The Sun is absorbing electricity from the universal field and transforming that energy into the 'light' that we see. Solar power is coming from outside not inside and its role is one of processing and transforming (decoding) not generating (Fig 127). We talk of sun cycles as the power of the Sun goes through highs and lows and these are measured by the number of sunspots or the massive 'holes' that appear on the surface (Fig 128). Mainstream Everything says that sunspots arc being punched from inside as nuclear energy emerges from within, but this theory doesn't stand up at all. Scientists say that solar energy comes to the surface through a 'radiative zone' and 'convective zone' when there is no evidence of a radiative zone, and an MRJ scan of the Sun revealed a convective zone so small that it was only one percent of that necessary for the theory to be valid. S un spot holes are punched by phenomenal elec tric al rnarges coming the other way (another inversion). At the ultraviolet level of the Sun you can see a torus or plasma doughnut circling the solar equator and this stores electricity from the Cosmos (Fig 129). When this torus over l oads extraordinary bolts of electricity (on the same principle as lightning) are discharged to punch holes in the solar surface. Sunspots measure solar activity and its cycles because the more electrical power gathered in the torus the more is disd1arged. The Sun operates in basically the same way as an electric light and dimmer switch. • .#"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"\"he e solar ,ery is ,lasma ty from 1.

You can't see this with the human eye, but it can be measured technologically. Here is another inversion: The hottest part of the Sun is way out from the surface in the corona. This can reach 200 miUion degrees Kelvin while surface temperature is only 5,000 degrees. I wonder which direction the electrical power is coming from then? David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill summarise the electrical principle in Tl11111derbolts of the Gods: From the smallest particl e to the largest ga la ctic formation, a web of electrical circuitry con nects and unifies all of nature , organizing galax ies , energizing stars, giving birth to planets and, on our own world, controlling weather and animating biological organisms.

Lm1itless electrical power all around us begs the question of why we rip Earth apart by digging and sucking out sources of energy like oil, coal and gas to generate electricity that we could tap into at will from universal sources.

Nikola Tesla said in the first half of the 20th century: 'All peoples everywhere sho uld have free energy sources ... electric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities and can drive the world's machinery without the need for coal, oil and gas.' Tesla proved the reality of free energy from an electrical Cosmos but was blocked at every turn and died virtually penniless in a New York hotel room in 1943 (Fig 130).

Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci, a 12th and 13th century Italian mathematician, identified the mathematics of hb 'F ibonacci sequence' in plants, flower s, trees, shells and proportions of the human face (Fig 133). Recurring numbers are part of a web of interconnected mathematics on which the virtual reality Figu re 133: The Fibonacci spiral in nature (the simulation, . simulation is founded. I heard a scientist say of flowers: 'They set up a little machine that create~ the Fibonacci sequence.' I would say they nre a machine in the sense that they are a creation of the click, click, enter interactive c;imulation and following the cycle of their encoded information blueprint. A US Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) dcx.-umentary in 2015, Decodmg tlze Unit,erse: Tlze Great Math Mystery, highlighted how mathematics exist at every level of the observable Universe and asked what this could be all about. I would answe r the que s tion with another question: Would it be a mystery to find mathematics at every level of a computer program?

Mathematics and geometry are indeed a glimpse into the hidden blueprints of ' physical ' reality . Galileo Calilei (1564-1642), the Italian astronomer and mathematician, sa.id that the Universe is written in the language of mathematics and so it is. Digital images are made of pixels - ' the basic unit of a digital image, representing a single colour or level of brightness' - and together these pixels interact to appear as a pictur e. We only see television ima ges when the brain decode5 the pixels formed on the scree n into perceivable still images and conn ects them in a way that produces the illusion of movement. An article in the New Sc,enti,;f magazine in 2009 exploring the possibility that reality is holographic , ~aid that under magnification ' the fabric of space-time becomes grainy and is ultimatel y made of tiny units rather like pixel s'.

Ancient initiates knew that mathematics and geometrical proportion was a way of communicating with the Universe. They knew t hat if they de signe d building~ such as churches and temples with certain geometrical and mathematical (digital) proportion s they would automatically generate their corresponding waveform and electrical energetic states (information and interdimensiona l connections). Geometrical and mathematical sequences are digital expressions of waveform and electrical information. The 'pr imitive' ancients would never have known that? Oh, yes, they wou ld, and did, in term s of their inner circle initiates, and the same s tream of knowledge continues in the inner circles of secret societies today. Ancient initiates in the mysteries of numbers - Pythagoras in Greece is the most famous example - believed that 'fractions are number s in the stages of becoming '. You find the same principle within quantum computer simulations in the form of electrons and atoms 'in stages of becoming' holographic 'p hy sica l' reality. My sterie s, wh a t m ys te rie s? Many more 'paranormal' questions dissolve when. we appreciate one of the most amazing characteristics of holograms and the way they store and distribute information. Thjs can be described in one sentence - every part of a hologram is a smaller version of Figure 134 : Every part of a hologram is a sm<1llcr version of !he whole. Figure 135: Human hrain activity and !he Univrrse - every part of a hologram is a smaller version of !he whole . the whole. Within those few words is a massive revelation. If you cut a holographic waveform print into four parts and apply the Jac;er they will each show a quarter-sized version of the w/,olt• image (Fig 13-l). information from the whole in1age is stored in every part of the image and this is the real origin of the term 'as above, so below'. Electrical activity in brain and Cosmos look so like each other because of the holographic principle (Fig 135). Fibonacci spirals on a shell are similar to the spira l of a galaxy, and the human energy or auric field is a smaller version of the Earth field through holographic information dbtribution {Fig 136). The s maller you go, holographically, the less clarity and detail you see. but it's the same information. Our holographic bodies are encoded with the information of the holographic Universe. Every part of the body stores. in miniatur e. informatio n about the whole body and from thb understanding we can be see how acupuncture, reflexology and other forms of alternative healing can identify poinh. figu Hu n and on the (Fig L<i a is a are the int e art exp buq f: rid ic th e t D an an d· Mee as ' i p rac B rit! fo r I"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Self ·ith nd :? is he ation. mof a · part s wa ge .age as brain Fig milar m on of 'SS ;ame HC rms 1ts Pu.normal' Is Normal figurell6: Human energy field and Earth energy field. on the ear, hand, foot, etc. that represent the heart, brain, lungs, liver and all the rest (Fig 137).

System minds are so programmed they believe that a pharmaceutical industry, which accmes its annual billion s from people being sick, has any interest in anything that would keep them healthy. Homeopathy is based on the fact that everything is information w h ether it's a plant or a drop of water. If it isn't information it can't exist. I have written at Length over the years about the information storage potential of water. Dr Masaru Emoto, the Japanese rec;earcher (who sadly left us in 2014), became well known for revealing the existence of information in water and how this can be changed by human and technological interaction. He was expanding on earlier research. I visited Dr Emoto's centre in Tokyo and we spt> nt a weekend in London s haring information for a co-authored book in Japanese. His work and mine complement each other. Even some mainstream scienti sts hav e been attacked and ridiculed for saying that water has a memory (stores information) when the evidence for thi s is overwhelming and must be true given that evcrytlting is information. Dr Emoto published many illu s trated books to show how thought, emotion and other frequency phenomena impacts on the st ructure of water and what goes for water goes for everything Figure 141: What .i mobile phone does 10 water else. He would attach words, sayings and crvs1als technology like cell phones to canisters of water and then freeze the water very quickly to photograph the ice crystals. What he found was stu nning confirmation of the interactive Cosmic lnternet. Words of love and appreciation produced beautiful patterns of balance and harmony while others such as 'You make me sick, r want to kill you ' ca used a distorted mess (Fig 139). Spoken words are clearly produced by vocal cords in the form of vibrating information fields and the same is true of the written word. We ~e words on paper or computer screens but they are only holographic versions of waveform, electrical and digital states.

We call the result a polluted (energetically-distorted) rh' er. lntent is an immensely powerfuJ energy and it 's not the words but the i11te11t be hind them that make:, the biggest energetic impact. This is the process through which in tent to achieve something can influence, attract, repel and restructure energetic fields (pe ople, opportunities etc.) to manifest your intent. 'If you believe it you will achieve it', th e :.aying goes, but a better word than believe is intend. People who think what they l\\' ant will never happen infuse that information into their energetic environment and so ~- it never happens. Half-empty /half-full mentalities impact themselves on ouI en ergetic world to repel or attract people , places, opportunities, ways of life and so on - al l of which are information fields because everything is. I call this phenomenon 'n brational magnetism' with electromagnetic fields in different information states attracting and repelling each other (synchronicity or Jack of \"ynchronicity). Docs anyone re ally think that people meet their partners, get jobs or bump into those they know in Hi e ,;trangest of places by random accident? How many times do we hear 'I'm so unlucky' and 'how could this happen to me of all people after what's happened to me be fore'? It is nothing to do with ' luck' , and it's happened again becaw,e the state of be ing(' attitudes') that created the first experience hasn't changed and so it is electromagnetically attracting a repeat. Albert Einstein said that 'synchronicity is God's w ay of remaining anonymous'. My We became a daily wave of synchronbtic experiences after my meetings with psychic Betty Shine.

All 'physical' experience is a holographic reflection of energetic information s tate s and to ch ange the holographic outcome you must change the energetic information state th rough visualisation, attitude and intent.

A substance (holographic illusion) may be gone but its e11ergefic i11Jormatio11 is still in the water and this does the healing by affecting the energetic information state of the body. Another experiment at the Aerospace Institute involved Figure 142: The Stuttgart water droplets . asking local people to take four droplets from a tank of water and place them in their designated dish . Researchers found that droplets taken by each individual were all different but the individual 's own set of four were virtually the same (Fig 142).

'Hands on healing' is an energy (information) exchange behveen the healer and the patient when the healer (genuine ones) tap into cosmic energy fields (frequencies).

Yawn . Astrology can work and does in the right hands and in the right depth and detail. Everything is information including planets, stars and 'space'. Their movements and interactions exchange information with the universal field or Cosmic Internl?t (Fig 147). They imprint their information signature upon the universal field in the same way as tho!:te people did with water in the German experiment (Fig 148). Movements of planets and stars in relation to Earth impact and change the planetary energy (information) field - the energy 'sea' - with which we are constantly interacting (Fig 149). Different planets or groups of planets will have most influence on the Earth field at different points in the cycles. Configurations of planets known in astrology as conjunctions, oppositions, trines, sextiles, squares etc., produce even more powerful information impacts through their combined influence . Humanity, in turn, is interacting with these changing influences but not all in the same way.

This is the basis of astrology - and ancient astronomers were al.;o astrologers. They knew the tw o di!-ciplines were in separab le. Astrology co lumn s in newspapers and magazines are dismissed because 'how can it be the same for so many people? ' [ agree in the sense that even the best of these columns can only be extremely generalised ; but when you go into the detail of an individual's astrological background those influences can be measured by skilled astrologers. I emphasise that these astrological influences are i11flue11ces and they don't have to dictate. I had to smile when I came across an astrologer's reading of my chart on th e Lnt ernet. It described influences that give energetic support for the life journey I have taken, but the reading said that on the negative side J might be open to betrayal by those I thought were friends and also legal s ituations . I have been in court (successfolly a~ it turned out) with two people who had told me how much they supported my work - and got their livelihoods from it - who were seeking to secure money they had not earned. One of them was trying to steal the entire rights to my books for which he had not produced a single syllab le. A third one who once earned his living from my work instigated legal action in pursuit of money while I wa!-> writing thb book after not hearing a peep from him for a year. I guess he just wanted to support my work which he had said was 'so important'. How noble. Between 2013 and 2015 everything was a challenge for me. No matter how hard I tried little worked as I wanted it to and it was a struggle just to stand still. Then everything changed like a cloud had lifted and fast forward momentum began again. Later an astrologer told me that in this same period the 'stars' (energetic environment) ,....,as very bad for me in anything to do with work. career, business and legal matters. The blocker was the position of Saturn and its impact on my energetic field and thus the area of my life to which its position re lat ed. This changed in September 2015 and so did the success of my work as I began riding an energetic wave instead of having it flowing against me . Astrology is all about ene r gy flows. Many corporate CEOs employ astrologer~ to ad\\'be them on when to make moves in busines~ to ensure that the energy environment is mo~t conducive to a successful outcome . An astrologer noted years ago that major changes in my life coincided with lunar eclipses agai n and again. Astrology may sound mumbo- jumbo but only to those who don't understand reality. My experienc~ and their connection to astro logical influences are clear to see when I look at my ovm life . Card games Tarot cards, run e stones and other forms of divination are also said to be ways of reading the future or possible I probable future . Well, it's not the future for a stc1rt when there is only the NOW. Divination techniques are reading (again in skilled hands) the probability of a sequence in the NOW. We exist on multiple levels and information/insight / perception / choice operates on all these levels. We exist in waveform , electromagnetic, mathematical I digital and holographic states as well as pure consciousness/ awareness. There is a 'yo u' on all those levels with its own point of attention and perspective. 'David lcke' is not 'me', only the holographic 'me' (Fig 151). We only experience choices with our conscious mind when they are decoded into the hologram as 'physical' happenings , and before that they are only possibilities/ probabilitie s in other energetic realms . I saw a quote which said:"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Paranormal' ts Normal 8 7 Accidents happen - that's what everyone says. But in a quantum universe there are no such things as accidents, only possibilities and probabilities folded into existence by perception. Perception = state of being= information/ frequency= which possibility I probability you will sync with and project into holographic existence and which you will not. This is why the whole foundation of human control is a Perception Deception . Control perception and you control human experience. Tarot cards and divination are not reading the future but rather reading the probable outcome of choices and sequences happening in the subconscious. This is a misleading term given that the subconscious is actuall y consciou s but at levels of awareness beyond the realms of our conscious mind. Subcon scious is conscious - but not to the five senses. Tarot cards are reading poss ibilities and probabilities (information) within our own deeper energetic fields. Figure 1 S 1; We are multi dimens ional bei n gs and the ho lograp h 1t 'physical' is on l y o ne o l them. Energy flow that manifests eventually as a holographic outcome is not from past through present to future , but between different levels of ourselves in the NOW as possibilities and probabilities become actualitie s. Each card is illu s trated with symbols that represent mental, emotional and information states (Fig 152). Symbols are energetic information just as words are, but much more powerful. Tarot cards are information field s repre senting energetically what the images symbolise and we don't choose the cards - the cards choose us. Cards are chosen by the ele ctromagnetic field of the card syncing frequencies (vibrational magnetism) with the electromagnetic field of the per s on in accordance with their information I energetic sta te (Fig 153) . They pick certain cards and not others through frequ ency compatibility between themselves and the cards.

I'll start with telepathy. Humans operate on a particular frequency band while also having our own unique e ne rgy signature within that band dictated by our mental, emotional, perceptional and DNA state. African tribal people who communicate this .-, , way led to the t erm 'bush telegraph' and this can include tuning into frequencies of animals to instinctively know where they are. All species are the same in terms of having their own particular collective frequency and animals and insects are more sensitive to consciously interacting with energetic communication fields because unlike human~ they don't get desensitised by The System (Fig 154) . From this comes the 'hundredth monkey syndrome' in which a small number of a ~pecies learn something new and suddenly others at different locations can do the same without being shown. Animal species are highly sensi tiv e to this communication system in the abse nce of a lifetime of programming to desensitise them to higher senses as with humans. Phantom Selves can be so energetica ll y isolated and 'dead' they don't pick up this bush telegraph; but many people do and especially when it involves dose friends or family members with whom a close bond (energetic/frequency connection) ha~ been established.

Extrasensory perception (ESP) works on the sa me principle. People just know that so mething has happened to someone dose to them without any other information to support this. Telepathy can also be used by sources in other realms of awareness with benevolent or malevolent intent to communicate with humans. Are they your thoughts you're thinking now? Sync:hronistic events can have many interacting sources but the means through which they happen is the same - the attraction of energetic states and frequencies or vibrational magnetism. Swiss psych iatrist Carl Jung said that synchronicity was proof of a coUective unconscious, and he was right. It's the bush telegraph again. Teleportation is the 'theoretical transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them.' This is fact not theory and it's possible because there is no matter as people perceive it. Teleportation is the transfer of information from one point to another and even the concept ot 'points' are illusions when you go deep enough into reality (Fig 156). Quantum phy sicists speak about 'entanglement' which basic ally involves downloading information to another 'location' by syncing where you are with where you want to go. We download an external file by connecting a computer to the location of the file and cause one to be copied by the other. Teleportation is the same principle , realJy.

Global g rid Other sources of paranormal 'mystery' are ley lines, stone circles, pyramids and so on . Planet Earth is criss-crossed and interpenetrated by a network of energy lines known variously as ley lines, dragon lines and meridians. These are the planet's version of the acupuncture meridians in the body on the holographic principle of as above, so below' (Fig 157). A vortex is created where the lines cross and the biggest vortexes are the planetary power centres where the ancients located stone circles, major temples and pyramids to tap into and manipulate the energy and also for interdimensional communication. Crystalline (quartz) stone was used to aid communication with 'the gods' for the same reason that quartz crystal is used in communication technology (Fig 158). Initiates in the circles could tune in to communications transmitted to the stones from other realties. Ancient initiates of the hidden knowledge knew far more than Mainstream Everything wants us to realise. To be aware that advanced knowledge existed in the ancient world is to ask 'why did they know things then that we've only just learned or still didn't know?

Lf knowledge is suppressed, socie ties can go the other way, too, into ignorance and reverse development. Compare ancient Egypt with modem Egypt. Initiates in the ancient world knew a great deal more than modern mainstream scie ntists with regard to the principles of reality. Today's secret societies and many religions are based on this know l edge while hiding behind a Biblical front. The Mom1on temple at Salt Lake Gty is built from crystalline granite for the same reason that Stonehenge is constructed with crystalline stone (Fig 159).

But if you locate your structures on the vortex points of a grid that is geometrically aligned then you automatically geometrically align your structure with tho:,,e at other points on the grid. Christian cathedrals and churches built on former Pagan sites inspired by vortex points are the same, and you have otherwise inexplicable alignments between Christian churches and ancient pre-Christian ~tructures. My information is that the British lsles are placed at the hea rt of the global grid pattern and there are more standing stones, circles and andent earthworks per !'tquare mile in Britain and Ireland than anywhere else in the world (especially centre- we~t and across to Ireland) . This energetic power and potential is why these tiny islands have such a history as a centre of global power - and they remain so from the shadows. Britain was considered sacred by the Druids , priestly initiates of the Celts, especially i.,lands s uch as the Isle of Man , Isle of Anglesey and Isle of Wight.

Research into 'aliens' 01orrible term) tends to focus almost entirely on the human visual frequency range or the 'p hy sical'. I have been interviewed twice for the Hi stor y Channel series Ancient Alie11s - which is very good as far as it goes, but I found it a frustra tin g experience trying to take the narrative beyond the illusory physical. A 2012 article in Psychology Today about DMT, the main active constituent of ayahuasca, describes how users can 'e ncounter non-human intelligence s, often resembling aliens'. I mentioned earlier that ayahuasca has been called a 'p lant of the gods' because it can open the frequency channels to those dimensions of reality where the perceived 'go d s' reside. Non-human or extraterrestrial life exists in a multiplicity of forms and expressions even among those who observe and interact with Earth. Some are benevolent, some neutral and still others have a malevolent agenda, which I have been exposing for decades. They have appeared to humans over thou sands of years and they are the source of endless myths about 'the gods'. The History Channel series is based on these s torie s and evidence to s upport them. Ancient Indian documents and text s de scribe advanced flying machines that brought the gods. Dr. V. Raghavan, retire d head of the Sanskrit department at the University of Madras, says that centuries-old documents written in the ancient Indian lan guage describe extraterrestrial visitations: Fifty years of researching this ancient work convinces me that there are living beings on other planets , and that they visited earth as far back as 4, 000BC. There is a just a mass of fascinating information about flying machines, even fantastic science fiction weapon s, th at can be found in translations of the Vedas (sc riptures ), Indian epics, and other ancient Sanskrit text. Inner-circle s of government and military know that extrater restrial lite is still visiting this planet and the y just don't want us to know. Most 'aliens' come in and out ot our reality. Accounts by those who claim to have seen them or their craft are ridiculed when they de scribe how they appeared out of nowhere and disappeared just as quickly. To Phantom Mind thi s is impossible, but it's not. When they enter our frequency band they appear to any observer as if they have manifested out of n ow here and the r everse when they disappear. They have neither appeared out of nothing nor disappeared into nothing. They enter the frequency range of human sight and leave again. Now you see them, now you don't.

Other flying saucer-type craft that people think must be ' aUens' are really flown by humans with secret technology. Anti-gravity craft have been built in the most secretive military bases especially in the United States for many decades and there are deep underground bases or 'DUMBS' all over the world where interaction takes place between the human 'elite' and extraterrestrial beings. I am coming to this whole area of human control by a non-human force in the next chapter and it goes way beyond 'aliens'. Exc u se my French Mainstream Everything sets out to trash the 'paranorma l' at every opportunity. This is through calculated design by those in the shadows and ignorance by their academic foot soldiers and slaves of The System. Phantom Self always dismisse:. what it doesn't understand. Academ ics get their information from other academics and program each other into mutual myopia. No one outside of academia can possib ly know more than them. If that were true their 'great education' would have to be seen for what it is-a hoax. Christopher French, Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths College, University of London , and former Editor-in-Chief of Tlze Skeptic magazine, is often wheeled out on television shows in Britain to trash anything ' paranormal'. I'm usually shaking my head when he's on giving his excruciatingly feeble explanations for why anything considered paranormal can't exist. Years ago, there was another academic paranormal-trasher who said that when people died in operating theatres and found themselves looking down at their bodies thi:, was their brain remembering life experiences in the course of dying. How could that be true unless the person had ever floated above their body looking down on it? Mainstream Everything is trying harder and harder to hold the line in the face of emerging evidence, and the academic narrative becomes more desperate and bizarre in response. Quantum physics already means their battle is ultimately lost. Psychiatry is clueless about the forces that both manifest consciousness and influence its perceptions. Shocking numbers of people having perfectly explainable 'paranormal' experiences are incarcerated and drugged only because psychiatry is so deeply infected with the arrogance of ignorance. Psychiatrists enforce their psychological fascism a:, agents of Mainstream Everything. They have downloaded The System's version of the huma11 mind and repeated this in their examinations to satisfy The System they are 'qualified' to be an agent of The System.

What I am about to say is a good measure for how deeply some people are entrenched in Phantom Self and how open others are to consider all possibility and not only programmed possibility. I say this because what is really happening, why and by whom, is a challenge to everything Phantom Self rep resents - limitation, unquestioning dogma, unyielding belief and a refusal to see beyond its downloaded sense of 'normal'.

I have been researching these subjects for decades and as the dot s have connected from the synchronistic flow of information (which is what I was told would happen through psychic Betty Shine) I have been able to weave together so many common themes that span what is termed human 'history'.

You will find all the highly detailed background .ind evidence in my other books , Like Tire Pern7'tio11 Deception.

I am going to tell the story here to the extent that it puts into essential context the architects of Phantom Self, the reason for it-; creation and why the world operates as it does. I will also take the story on further than ever before. ThLs hidden force is given different names by ancient and modem cultures but the way it is described and its goals and modus operandi are remarkably consistent. Christianity U!)es the term demons; Islam (and pre-Islamic Arabia) refers to Jinn or Djinn; pagan Gnostic; warned about Archons; Zulu legend tell s of Chitauri; Central American shamans call them Flyers, Predators and other names; on and on it goes around the world. They arc different names describing the smm• force that is portrayed almost wherever you go as the malevolence that has infiltrated and hijacked human reality. Endless gods and goddesses worshipped by the ancients were also largely different names for this force. Today's religion emerged from the worship of these perceived 'gods' which were eventually fused into one God by monotheistic faiths, most notably Judaism, Christianity and Islam. All believe in a negativ e force behind human affairs under names like the Devil, Satan, Lucifer, lblis, Asrnodai, Haggadah and Samael ('angel of death'). This th e me can be found everywhere because this force e'<ists cmd has been directing human society for a very long 'time'. Religious advocates miss the fact that often their one God is only anot her version of demon gods in yet another monumental inversion as I have explained at len gt h in Tire Perception Deception and will address later.

They were spiritual outca<;ts of mainstream religion and were constantly, violently and mercilessly targeted by the System- created Roman Church , which ~aw them as a potentially lethal threat to its make-believe dogma. A famous example was the horrific assault on the Gnostic Cathars in the Languedoc in southern France that culminated with the siege of the castle at Montsegur in 12-14. This put an end to the Figure 164: The Royal Library in Alt-~andria. Egypt, was ,in incredibl e depository 01 anuenr 1.nowledge and history . Catha rs or at least those with a public face. Another barbarous attack on Gnostics by the forces of peace and love came with the sacking and burning of the Gnostic- inspired Roya.I Library at Alexandria in Egypt in around -llSAD (Fig 164). This was home to half a million scrolls and document~ detailing history and accumulated knowledge from the ancient world which the Roman Church did not want people to know about. Christianity's ludicrous narrative, pedalled and imposed so violently by the Church hierarchy and its programmed minions , would have been demolished by the content. I'm sure that what didn't go up in flames wa<; secretly ~ecured in the vaults of the Vatican and will still be there today. Rome's as~ault on the Royal or 'Great' Library included the hacking to death of Hypatia (350-415AD), a mathematician, astronomer and philosopher Figure 165: A painting depicting Hypar, a. who was head of the Platonist school at Alexandria (Fig 165). She taught the views of Greek philosophers Plato and Ari stotle to Pagan and Christi.1.n students alike. Advanced and open mind~ gathered at the RoyaJ Library to seek answers to the Mys teries. Among them was a man who accurately measured the size of Earth and another who established that Earth orbit s the Sun - 2,000 years before this was officially discovered by Polish Renaissance mathematician and astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus. Gnostics used their open minds in pursuit of knowledge and also took psychoactive potions to expand their awareness in the same way that I did with ayahuasca. Knowledge - or gnosis to them - was not only about names, dates and places, but deeper awareness of other realities from where they could better understand this reality. Gno~tic ·~ow ledge' has the connotation of internal , intuitive knowledge that can see beyond the program. Their expanded awarenes~ could tap into insight and knowledge that Phantom Self cannot under the ignore-trance speJJ of The System. Knowledge is always dangerous to any tyranny which survives through suppression of knowledge and the Roman Church ensured that little survived of Gnostic insight. Well, that was the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"ria, ng y 5. y. e Tht ~cret - Shhhhh' case until a startling find in 1945 at Nag Hammadi, a town some 77 miles from Luxor in Egypt. A sealed glass jar discovered by a local wa~ found to contain 13 codices and more than 50 text.., by Pagan Gnostics (not to be confused l with the later Christian Gno..,tics although their f beliefs had great si mil arities). The find at Nag Hammadi was a game-changer for those who could Sl!e its true significance, but was virtuaJly Fig ur e 166: The Nag Hammadi find was ignored (for obvious reasons) by Mainstream sem,ation,11 and so it wa~ largely ignored bv the Everything (Fig 166). Texts revealed that the mainstream . Gnostics believed the 'material' world we see is a fake reality, and they made the crucial distinction between what they called nous (Phantom Self) and p11euma (Infinite Self). Gnostics also used the term Bythos or 'Void' ior the 'Dazzling Darkness ' (AU That ls) which they said existed before our world was created . This has to be the case when Bythos is the All Possibility and All Potential from which all form or illusions of form are ultimately manifested. I was taken aback when I read of the Nag Hammadi texts because they described my own conclusions gleaned in other ways and from other sources. Ladies a nd gentlemen - the Archons A fifth of Gnostic texts discovered at Nag Hammadi are focussed on non-human entitie~ that they call' Archons' (a name meaning 'rulers' in Greek). This is the force behind the 'Matrix' simulation that we experience as the Universe and The System of human control and subjugation. Gnostic texts say Archons can possesc; the human mind and manipulate perception. They explain how Archons remain hidden (in another frequency range) and are able to manipulate illusions and in:;til beliefs. Gnostics describe Archons ai:. 'deceivers' who engineer illusion, which th ey call pl1a11tasit1 - including the fake human reality, Matrix or simu lati on that r will describe in the next chapter. They say Archons invert reality and today's inverted society that I have long exposed is only the current state of an ongoing inversion imposed by th.is common source (Fig 167). In our ver.,ion of 'time' Archons were manipulating humanity in the Gnostic period, and for aeonc; before, in the same way they do today. They have been securing ever more control by the centralbation of globa l power and decision-making - which is precisely what we see now at such an advanced stage. Nag Hammadi texts say Archons lack t•1111oia or 'intentionality'. I wuuld use the term creative imagination. There is a reason for this , as J will be exp laining. Figure 167: Ar chn ns in ve rt every thin g thl 'Y ro uch .ind !hi , is wh y S, 1l a ni s in d <)(\". ! he sa mE •"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"• 98 Figure 168: /\\,\\any names - same force. Lack of en11oia means Archons cannot create anyth ing from scratch. They can only piggyback, imitate, change and distort what ha s already been created.

Give them a blank sheet of paper and the y would be lost, but give them paper with an image or written word and they can manipulat e, distort and imitate what is already there. They can do things far ahead of what Phantom Self human s can do thanks to knowledge gleaned from other more advanced realiti es and not because of their own creative imagination. Gnos tic s referred to Archons as parasites, and part of the reason for this is that they must feed off creative energy and imagination of humans to overcome their disadvantage of not having any themselves. To maintain this status quo Archons have to keep humanity in ignorance of their very exis tence , never mind their manipulations, goals and illu sions. A glance at the world with an open mind will confirm that this continues today. We live in such a parasite society with the political and banking system alone feeding off creativity and labour of the people through oppression, taxation and intere st on debt. Archons have specifica11y structured the financial sys tem and The System in general to parasite human energy and creative imagination. Not only do' Arcbons' as described by the Gnostics fit perfectly with my own research over the last 26 years, but it describes what the Islamic and pre-Islamic wor lds say of the Jinn; Christianity says of demons; Central American shamans say of Flyers and Predators; Zulu and other African peoples say of Cltitauri; and other cultures say of their names for a negative force of human manipulation. Gnostics said Archons are made from 'luminous fire ' while the Koran says Jinn are made from 'smokeless fire' (Fig 168). Jinn, or Djinn, comes from an Arabic root word meaning 'hidden' or 'to hide'. They are said to be supernatura l beings that live in a parallel realm {frequency band) and are invisible to us. Gnostics said the same about Archons and it is a universal theme. Jim, are the origin of the term genie - entities described as pure energy in their prime state, but which can manif est in form (Fig 169). This is again what the Gnostics said about Archons and others say about their version of the same phenomenon. Gnostic texts describe how Archons serve the Lord Archon or 'Demiurge' which they say is the fake 'God' that created our illusory 'p hy sical' or 'material' reality and s tand s between humanity and the 'transcendent' God (InfinHe Awareness).

A virus can change and distort what we sec on a computer screen and the Demiurge/ Archon virus has done the same with our 'screen' or decoded sense of reality (Fig 173). Gnostics described Demiurge/ Archons in term<. of what today we would call technology or computer-like. They are a form of Artificial lntellige11ct' and my goodness how significant that is going to be later in the book to what is happen i ng in human society. Artificial Intelligence explains their lack of 'ennoia' or creative imagination. A machine-like force totally di.,connected from Infinite Awareness has no imagination. It can only copy, infiltrate and take over like a virus in a computer. I described earlier how the simulation we call the Universe operates as a quantum computer with its own self-awareness. I said: 'Quantum physicists are realising that all matter (concentrated energy) is a form of computer, but in fact all energy can compute information because it is conscious.' Demiurge/ Archons are a conscious (to an extent) Artificial Intelligence computer virus which has set out to take over everything (Fig l 74). It can't do this with Creation as a wholl' because it is not even remotely powerful enough, but it can - and has-wreaked havoc in our reality and in other realities and 'worlds'. Humans began to 'know good and evil' when the virus struck and its many guises brought what we call evil (a distortion of balance and harmony).

Machines in Tire Matrix used human energy as their power source and the Demiurge I Archon virus does the same. A computer virus gets its power from the computer. Morpheus in The Matrix captured this theme when he held up a battery and said that the Matrix was 'a computer-generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this' (Fig 175). Not just any human energy will do for Archons. It has to Phantom Self be within the frequency range of the virus or it can't be absorbed and the energy that syncs with the Archon Figure 174: Th e Demiurge/Archon virus has li!ken over human society by hijacking human perception and Phantom Self is fundamental to that viru s is .. . low-vibrational emotion based on fear and its s ubdivisions like anxiety, stress, hatred , resentment, revenge , conflict, depression and competition.

Sacrificing people to 'the gods' was - and is - to relea se extremes of emotion through sheer terror and make a gift of 'food' to 'the gods' (Archons beyond human sight). Evil is appropriately the word 'live' written backward s - inverted. Demiurge I Archons are obsessed with death from their role as an inversion of 'live' or life and therefore their manifestation s in our reality Like Satanists and black magicians are ob sesse d with death (Fig 176). Human and animal sacrifice is often performed in cemeteries and churches s urrounded by graves of dead people. Death is energy with its own frequency, and all the wars, mass slaughter and death from preventable hunger and di s ease are the work of the global Archon Death Cult that direct s human society and feeds off the energy it is manipulated to Figure 175: Humans have been turned into a power source for the virus.

Shining black leather and PVC are also used to sym bolise the goo/virus in music videos and s tage shows, as is Darth Vader in the Star Wnrs series. Possession is real Gnostics and other cultures describe the motivations and behaviour traits of the Demiurge/ Archons ('the viru s') in the same way that the term 'psychopath' is defined- no empathy, remor se or shame, pathological liars (deceivers) and parasites who do whatever it take s to get their way. Archons under their many global names and aliases are also described as having no emotion and a trait of psychopaths is the 'shallow effect' or an inability to express a range of emotions. Human psychopaths are those deeply infected with the Archon virus, and psychopathy is much more prevalent in society than is widely believed. What Gnostics call the Demiurge is the original dis tortion/viru s and Archons are copies or reproductions that serve the distortion/ virus. People need to suspend their focus on form or a classic 'Devi l' figure to grasp what is happening. Malevolence is not a 'being' as we perceive the term but a djstorted energy I awareness which can take forms that reflect its distortion. This can be anything from the hideous and distorted faces of a classic 'Exorcist' posses sio n to a (psychopatruc) bank CEO causing poverty and suffering in pursuit of still more money and control. Infestation by the virus of the body-computer is the real foundation of 'demonic possession' . This is an age-old theme when demonic enbties are said to take over thoughts, emotions and behaviour of their human targets. These accounts are universal across history and culture and remain so today . To dismiss them without investigation is the response of either an idiot or someo ne so terrified they might be true that they employ ridicule and dismissal to say 'shut up, I don't want to hear it'. A majority react the same way to any mention of conspiracies for the same reason. The rejection of possession as 'not possible' betrays yet again an ignorance of reality. If people are 'solid', how can they be possessed in ways described both ancient and modem? They couldn't be, but people are 11ot solid. They are energy I awareness and can be possessed or taken over by other energy I awareness c1s long as the frequencies are compatible. Po ssess ion happen s when an entity or energy (the virus) attaches to the human amic field and begin s to dictate thoughts, emotions and perceptions. Human fields with high vibra nt frequencies cannot be po ssessed by malevolence , but once people foll into low vibrational (Archontic) states the frequency compatibility is sec ured and possession can take place. Drug and alcohol abuse can lower human frequency enough to enter the realm of the Archon virus and having sex with a possessed person can allow a po ssessing en tity I virus to slip across the energetic connection to possess the partner. Tt's the same principle as a virus infecting one computer infiltrating another. Possession takes many forms, not only the distorted faces and demonic behaviour portray ed in films like Tiu.> Exorcist (Fig 180). Those extreme levels of obvious possession do happen but it is mostly far more subtle and often almost imperceptible. Effect on behaviour can span the range from barely obsen rable to full-blown psychopath and facial distortion. When the attachment is relativ ely weak on the person's auric field the virus may hardly impact itself on the hologram of the target. People po ssessed in this"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"'111 Soc m - Shlrhhh ' figure 181: As the anrormillJOn fields ot the possessing entiry or virus impilcl upon the fields of the ta~et person their h\"lographic. ieaturcs begin lo morph and distort to reflect the possessing force. 105 wJy (the majority) continue to look as they always have, although their behaviour and perceptions will be affected to the extent of the possession; but the more powerfully and totally the virus/ entity attaches itself the more its 'personality' dictate~ their behaviour and perceptions and they can start to change as the information infusion from the possessing field impacts upon the hologram (Fig 181 ). At this point an observer will see the face or even the ent ire body of the posses~ed person change and distort to reflect the nature of the possessing en tit y. I have seen people distorted like this, and others who s till looked basically the same but with clear facial changes and very darkened eyes after pos<,ession had taken them over to the extent that their personality became very different. What I have just described is a form of shapeshifting although there are other explanat ions for that, too, and I will deal with them later. I have been constantly ridiruled for saying that the world is covertly ruled by shapeshifting 'leaders' who can ~hift behveen human and reptilian (and other) forms. But it's true, despite sounding crazy to those who have done no research into any of this (virtually everyone). Possessed people can be schizophrenics who jump from one personality to another (their own and the possessor). It's not the only reason for schizophrenic behaviour, but it is one. Sometimes a possessing agent of the virus will withdraw and the person's own personality returns until the entity imposes itself again and the target goes through a sometime dramatic personality tran sformation. Those who have lived with Satanists describe how they can be one personality by day and quite another by night. Entities can also use their possessed vehicles to infiltrate other people and groups with their 'nice' mask and then suddenly turn on them with a malevolence aimed at doing as much damage as possible. I have experienced this myself several times and those involved will mostly have no idea that their malevolent motivations were not coming only from them, but also from that which possesses them.

They must have been vibrationally open and frequency-compatible for this connection to happen; but there are also a mass of covert government/ military mind control programmes designed to attach possessing entities to otherwise innocent people, who then become their agents (see T/1e Biggest Secret). Those expos ing The System and especially the Archon vims (very few) need to be constantly vigilant because they are goi ng to be targeted by these programmes and other techniques for obvious reasons. It's certainly happened to me. Wha t follows is a very accurate description of possession attributed to Rumi, a 13th century Persian poet, Islamic scholar and Sufi mystic. Note that date - the 13th century- and the same is happening today: When a man is possessed by an evil spirit The qualities of humanity are lost in him. Whatever he says is really said by that spirit, Though it seems to proceed from the man's mouth. When the spirit has this rule and dominance over him, The agent is the property of the spirit, and not himself; His self is departed , and he has become the spirit. This describes not only members of the general population subject to possession, but most crucially it applies to those in positions of political, economic, military and administrative power who are mere agents and vehicles in our world of the Archon virus. I will exp lor e this further shortly. 'He says the world is run by seven-foot lizards ' Okay, shapeshift ing lizards. This is the phrase you see almost every time my name is mentioned in the media (mainstream and most of the 'alternative') and by the thoroughly ignorant who ridicule me on the Internet as the man who believes in 'lizard people' (Fig 182). They all think they are making sta tem ents about me when they are really exposing their own immaturity and ignorance - Phantom Self. 'David lcke believes the world is run by shapeshifting lizards', they say as they laugh and mock. And that's it. No further questions, no further research. The idea that 's hape shiftin g Figur e 182 : Reptilian enlilies manipulating human affairs is a fact - no matter how much people may ridicule me. li zards', or Reptilians as I call them, could even exist let alone run the world is so far beyond their programmed sense of the possible that their Phantom Selves can't breach their perception firewall.

Why should they further question and research when the program tells them it is obviously aU madness?

Myopic perception afflicts the whole of humanity no matter what the label, background or income bracket and the antidote is always the same - an open mind. People from all walks of life who are not totally controlled by Phantom Self can look at the world from a far less programmed per s pective if they have a mind of their own. For those who do, I'll explain why Figure 183: Gnostic texts from at lea,t 400AD describe reptilian and grey e nt ities that ,ire reported hy witnesses and the UFO research community toda y. Reptilians are not so crazy. The self-ware Demiurge/ Archon virus can take many forms and possess any form that falls into its frequency range . Two of the most common are reptilian and what have become known as the 'Grey aliens' with their grey 'skin' and big black eyes (Fig 183). I don't mean all entities that take these forms, but certainly those possessed and infected by the Archon virus. A theme running through accounts about Archons, Reptilians and Greys is that they operate with a hive mind much like an ant or bee colony serving a central control system in the form of the queen. This make s sense since they are expressions of the virus and this is their hive-like communication and control network. Archons are seeking to attach humanity into the same hive 'Demiurge Internet' which dictates perceptions and behaviour of Archons and virus-possessed Reptilians and Greys. This is what Figure 184 : A painting of a Reptilian entity - the Chitauri hv Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa from ancient and modern descriptions. tran s humanism is really all about. Reptilians and Greys are believed by many to be a modem phenomenon as described by the UFO and alien research community. There are large numbers of people worldwide who s ay they have se en these entities and even been abducted by them - many for genetic experiments and hybrid interbreeding programmes. In fact, reports of Reptilian s, Greys and other non-human entities are not new at all. Account s all over the wo .rld and throughout history have told of reptilian 'gods' and non-human entities or 'go ds ' and 'ant people' that fit the description of Greys (Fig 184) . Compared with humans some Reptilians are very tall, and some Greys are very short, and this has led to tale s of both 'giants' and the ' Little People'. Gnostic text s found at Nag Hammadi in 1945 say that the Archons can take a re ptilian form and also a form that looks like an unborn baby or foetus with grey skin and dark, unmo ving eyes.

Accounts of Reptilians and Greys describe how they can appear and disappear (enter the human frequency range and then depart) and that they are cold, mechanical and have no empathy or conscience. The same is said of the Archons under their various names and disguise., and that's because the Reptilians and Greys involved are manifestation .... of the Demiurge / Archon virus/ distortion. Ancient and modern accounts say Reptilians can possess human minds to control behaviour and describe how they interbred with humans to create hybrid bloodlinei:. which are part- human and part-Reptilian (Archon virus). These are the hybrid 'elite' bloodlines that run The System to this day for the hidden Archons, but there b a reptilian dimension to all humans. The '!eke is mad' brigade in their legions won't know that one of the most profound influC'nces on human behaviour is the reptilian brain - what !>Cience calls the R-complex (Fig 185); or that the hum,m embryo also goes through a reptile stage at the ~tart of its development. Survival is the focus of the reptilian brain and it is con!>tantly scanning the environment for potential threats to survival whether they be 'physical', financial or anything from relationships to reputation. Reptilian brain doe1,n't think, it reacts, often emotionally, and its currency is fear. It is heavily involved in the fight or flight response. Mainstream science says the reptilian part of the brain is rc~ponsible for the following behaviour traits: Cold-blooded behaviour and 'territoriality' - this is mine; a desire to control; an obse.sion with hierJrchical structures of power; aggression, might is right and winner takes all; protecting stJtus, power , reputation, superiority, intellectual pre-eminence and can also lead to acquiescence to hierarchy and authority . These are also traits of the Archons / Reptiliam, / Grey~ (what a 'coincidence'}. The 'They' or 'Them' working towards total control of human society are expressions of the virus, either directly or through possession. This covers the whole raft of name~ and manifestations from the Demiurge (prime virus) to Archons, Jinn, Demon~, Flyers etc., and the Reptilian:, and Greys infected by the virus. For the rest of the book I will use Demiurge virw,/ Archon virus/Demiurge/ Arc.hons/ Archon Reptilians I Reptilians I Greys as interchangeable terms because they are all either the viru1> itself, manifestations of the virus or infected by the virus to the point of complete control. Look again at behaviour traits of the psychopath: no empathy, remorse or <ihame, pathological liars (deceivers) and parasites who do whatever it takes to get their way.

Original texts before translation referred to so ns of the gods, plural, and to the sons of the Elohim as with 'bene ha-'elohim '. Elohim = Archons. Recurring accounts of human s interbreeding with non-human 'gods' often include reptilian themes. Legends of the African San people , or Bu shmen, say humanity was created by the 'Great Python ' when he arrived with a 'bag of eggs' in the Tsodilo Hills in the Kalahari De sert of Botswana. The oldest form of religious worship so far uncovered is the worship of the serpent or python going 'back' at least 70,000 years to the same Tsodilo Hills. Worship of snake and serpent 'gods' is not only incredibly old but also globally widespread. Rebecca Cann, Assistant Professor of Genetics at the University of Hal, ·aii, was the co-author of a study published in the journal Nature in 1987 presenting evidence that modern humans de scend from a single mother in Africa about 200,000 BC -a single mother or a single hybr id genetics programme? Zulu Chitauri 'gods' are said to be reptilian - the ' People of the Serpent' - and Mayans of Central America say the first settlers of their land were the Chanes or 'People of the Serpent' led by the god ltzamna. The name is said to derive from 'itze m' (lizard or reptile) and the sacred city of lt zamna would translate as 'the place of the Hzard' or 'Iguana House' (Fig 186). Mayan legends tell of a reptilian race known as the 'Iguana Men' who came from the sky and taught them how to build p yra mid s (Fig 187) . Reptilians were pyramid builders all over the world because of the frequency effect in suppressing Earth's energy grid. Anunnaki, an 'alien' race recorded in ancient Sumer and Bab ylon (present-day Iraq), were de5cribed with reptilian connotation s. They were said to be led in their mission to Earth by h, ·o brothers, Enki and Enlil. Legend s of the Zulu Chitauri also include two prominent reptilian brothers, Wowane and Mpanku , and are dearly based on the same story. The Biblical Garden of Eden (similar tales can be found around the world) has a ~rpent on centre stage with Adam and Eve and relates to the 'FalJ of Man' (Fig 188).

'Fall' refers to frequency as I will come to. Legends of Golden Age Earth could be likened to the world of the blue people, or Na'vi, portrayed in the movie Avatar. Humans previously had far more expanded awareness, communicated with animals and plants through conscious telepathy and knew that everything is connected to everything else. I have asked Christian believers who laugh at the idea of hidden reptilian overlords if they really believe that the serpent in the Garden of Eden was a snake that could talk. The 'Fall of Man' was discovered to be a global theme in the study of serpent worship by Reverend John Bathurst Deane who detailed his research in a 1933 book, Tile Worship of tire Ser,1ent. He found worship of reptilian gods and imagery everywhere and he wrote in conclusion: It appears, then. that no nations were so geographically remote. or so religiously discordant but that one - and only one - superstitious characteristic was common to all: that the most civilized and the most barbarous bowed down with the same devotion to the same engrossing deity; and that this deity either was, or was represented by, the same sacred serpent. It appears also that in most, ii not all, of the civilized countries where this serpent was worshipped, some fable or tradition which involved his history, directly or indirectly, alluded to the Fall of Man in Paradise, in which the serpent was concerned. What follows, then, but that the most ancient account respecting the cause and nature of this seduction must be the one from which all the rest are derived which represent the victorious serpent- victorious over man in a state of innocence, and subduing his soul in a state of sin, into the most abject veneration and adoration of himseli. Legends and accounts of serpent god~ can be found everywhere, most obviously in China, J apan and the Far East where the reptilian dragon bat the centre of their culture. Even the 'Devil and Satan' in the Biblical Book of Revelation is described as a dragon. People laugh at reptilian 'gods' when the evidence is there all over the world if they would only take the trouble to turn off the program long enough to do even a modicum of research. Hive - mind humanity Interbreeding between Archon-Reptilians and humans did not have to be through sexual procreation. You only have to observe technological techniques of today to realise what is potentially possible and this includes growing body parts in laboratories.

We live in a simulated world controlled by the Demi urge / Archons and they play a role that can be compared with a computer programmer. Humans and human society are the program. Writers and programmers of videogames are obviously far more advanced in their knowledge than those in the game. Human perception of how interbreeding can happen is only human perception. Archon-Reptilians are not const rained by the Limitations they impose on humanity. People think in terms of 'natural' flesh and blood, but Archon-Reptilians know what the body really is - a holographic, biological ' computer' - and they treat it as such. Biological L5 technological to them and when you study stories and accounts of the Archon-Reptilians in all their forms it is clear that they are obsessed with technology of all kinds. Human scie ntists today are working with biological technology and creating syn thetic forms of biological processes. Genetic mutation 111 Figure 189: When genetic information i, bro.ulcast rm the frequency oi human DNA ;i mass mutation can he lrigg<'rcd. I of humanity could have been done collectively simply by broadcasting genetic infom1ation of the 'new human' to the DNA of the 'old human'. DNA is a receiver- transmitter of information and so is the entire body hologram and associated energetic fields. If virus-infected information and genetic blueprints were broadca st on the frequency of 'old human ' DNA it would mutate the bod y's genetics by mutating its information field (Fig 189). A Russian research group led by biophysicist and molecular biologist Pjotr Garjajev transformed frog embryos to salamander embryos by transmitting salamander DNA information patterns. The next stage of human genetic mutation (including obesity) is being engineered today through food, drink, water additives and other chemic al concoctions plus the fantastic increase in technological radiation in the atmosphere - millions of times what it was 50 years ago. What doe s radiation do? It mutate s genetics. And what does obesity do? Limits and weakens the body and can pass the sa me characteristics to the next generation. Food additives are intentionally addictive -witness sugar - to keep people on a diet of poisonous, genetic- mutating shite. Aichons overcome in part their lack of creative imagination through technological means . It is not a contradiction to say they don't have creativity while at the sa me time they deal in technology . A computer 'tec hy' may not be very bright and have no gift for imaginative ideas and creativity, but if he knows how something works he can appear technologically advanced and gifted to someone who may be bright and creative but knows little about computers. Take that analogy further to where access to knowledge about computers has been systemically suppressed so that the bright, creative p erson has never seen a computer. The not very bright techy will then appear to be a genius doing what appears to be miraculous feats. Jn the Kingdom of the Blind the one-eyed man is king. Archons are the one-eyed man and they have ensured that humans are blind to what is really possible. This and their secrecy are the only way they could have such power over their gifted and creative human targets (those in a non-"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"112 Phantom Self Phantom state). The Archon virus has piggybacked human society and knowledge to feed off the creativity of others. Hum ans are not the only ones subjected to Archon- Reptilian manipulation. A Ne.ms magazine article some years ago featured the work of what was claimed to be an insider revealing a secret project called the Channelled Holographic Access Network Interface, or CHAN!. It described how the govemment- backed CHAN] group had access to advanced technology located in Africa and communicated with an entity in another dimension or frequency band. Interaction /i nterface was said to have started in 1994 and over the next five years some 20,000 questions were asked and answered. The article induded the following comments attributed to the entity: • A reptilian race was holding back humans 5() they couldn't 'grow'. • The entity's species had fought many b,1ttles against the reptile race in their own reality. • Humans were more evolved spiritually than the reptiles but they suppres.c; humans with their technology- 'thei r god is their technology'. Whatever you may think about the CHAN! article's validity what is said there is absolutely in line with what I have researched since 1990. Common themes just go on recurring. Here is another major point: Archons are not only obsessed with technology - they are technology in the sense that in their foundation form they are rogue information or 'error' that operates like a computer virus infesting everything it touches be it Reptilians, Greys or humans. Arch.on-Reptilians deal in 'technological procreation' that jq far more ad\\•anced than human knowledge even at the cutting edge where scie ntists now seed and grow babies in laboratorie<,, gene splice and genetically manipu l ate to produce offspring without sex. Rese<ucher Mike Barrett at Nat11ra /society .com wrote: Although gene-altering drugs are indeed helping to pave the way for iurther human genetic modification, it is only a single move in the game. lust a few months ago, we reported on the very first group of genetically modified babies being ·created' in the United States.

If you consider again behaviour traits of the reptilian brain according to majnstream science you can see the connection to behaviour trait s of the Archon virus and its Reptilian agents: Cold-blooded behaviour and 'territoriality' - this is mine; a desire to control; an obsession with hierarchical structures of power; aggression, might is right and winner takes all; protecting status. power, reputation, superiority, intellectual pre-eminence and can also lead to acquiescence lo hierarchy and authority. This is what human society has also become and has been since the Archon hijack. Archon-Reptilian genetic I energetic manipulation attached humanity to their collective mind like ants in a colony obeying the queen and to their fake reality Matrix simulation that we experience as daily 'life' (Fig 190). The reptilian aspect of the human brain is a major access point for the Archon hive mind. Don Juan Matus, the Mexican shaman quoted in the books of Carlos Castaneda, described the hijack very powerfully, as quoted in Castaneda's final book, The Acth1e Side of Infinity: We have a predator that came from the depths of the Cosmos and took over the rule uf our lives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lord and master . It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses our protest If we want to act independently , it tiemands that we don't do so ... indeed we are held prisoner! They took us over because we are food to them, and they squeeze us mercilessly because we are their sustenance. lust as we rear chickens in coops, the predators rear us in hum an coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always available to them. Think for a moment. and tell me how you would explain the co ntradictions between the intelligen ce of man the engineer and the stupidity of his svstems of belief , or the stupidity of his contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs, our ideas of good and evil; our social mores. They are the ones who set up our dreams of success or failure. They have given us covetousness, greed and cowardice. It is the predator who makes us complacent, routinary and egomaniacal. In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged themselves in a stupendous manoeuvre - stupendous, of course, from the point of view of a fighting stra tegist: a horrendous manoeu vre from the point of those who suffer it.

My own research over the last 26 years supports every word. 'Food to them' is referring to human energy manipulated into low-vibrational states. 'System of beliefs' is the perception program running through Phantom Self. ' They gave us their mind' came from attaching humans to the Archon's collect i ve mind (virus) and their fake 'Matrix' reality. Why does so much human behaviour, and especia ll y among the 'elite' and 'leaders', imitate profusely-described traits of the Archons? You have your answer. Archon-Reptilian genetic/ energetic infiltratio n is the means through which humans are connected to the Archon control system so they can 'give us their mind' , and transhumanism is about making this connection even more extreme and total. Don Juan Matu s makes the point about the predators giving us our ideas of good and evil. Adam and Eve (symbolic of virus-infected rewired humans) were sa id to be enticed by the serpent to eat the apple {virus) in the Garden of Eden to know good and evil. Cosmologist Carl Sagan identified the fundamental impact on human behaviour of our reptilian genetics in his book, The Dra gous of Eden : It does no good whatsoever to ignore the reptilian component of human nature , particularly our ritualistic and hierarchical behaviour. On the contrary, the model may help us understand what human beings are really about. Archon-Reptilian 'elite ' Archon predators or expressions of the virus use the modus operandi of remaini ng hidden while using other~ to do their bidding in the world of the '!>een'. Or, rather, what is seen by humans, anyway . What better way to control unmolested and unchallenged than to do so whjJe your targets have no idea that you exist and even ridicule and abuse those who say you do? A rchons a.re experts at deception and illusion - pltantasia . People will ask why they don't just come out and takeover , but they can't. They are manifestations of an energet ic distortion / virus and have severe limitations compared with humans in their true power and potential. Many legends speak of the predators' tear of humans shou ld they be discovered and this is another reason they stay out of sight - at lea st for now. They have to so deceive humanity that we build our own prison (which we are every day), to the point of complete subjugation. Then we might openly see manifestations of the virus in form . Archons also stay hidden becau se of a simple law of frequency. 'They' (virus) operate primarily in a different frequency band to ours. Energetically and in most of their various forms they are not on the wavelength of our reality and nor do they sync with our atmosphere. They need far more radiation than we do, and this is the real background to why the Earth 's atmosphere is being so massively ir radiated through technology. The viru s needs power which it cannot generate itself (hence humans being its 'batteries') and it can draw this power from state!> of high radiation. Fukushima , which has been emitting s taggering levels of radiation since the nuclear meltdowns of 2011, was an accident? Sure it was- see Remember W/1() You Are and The Per cepti on Deception .

It's a similar principle to people only being able to stc1y a short time in radiation fields during nuclear leaks before they have to leave to protect their health (it's often too late even then). Demiurge / Archons overcame these limitations by engineering particular hybrid bloodlines (biological computer programs) that I will call variously the 'Elite', Archon bloodlines, Archon-Reptilian bloodline s and the hybrids. These r epresent Archon interests and plans within the human frequency band, and they are genetic (information) constructs specifically designed to be vehicles for the Demiurge virus and therefore they behave as the virus does . There are different \\eve.ls of virus infiltration, which are reflected in how much people are influenced by fnfinite Awareness. You have those with expanded awareness who can override much (rarely all) of the impact of Phantom Self and the virus; those with Phantom Self in overwhelming control of perception (majority); Phantom Self in total control (psychopaths); and 'Elite' blood.lines who are Archons incarnate - super-psychopaths (Fig 191). I can best symbolise the role of the hybrid bloodlines with the analogy of a scientist working in a laboratory with material too dangerous to touch directly. The material is placed in a sealed tank and the scientist s tands outside with his arms in long gloves that allow him or her to work inside while standing outside (Fig 192). If you think of the scientist as the Demiurge I Archons, the tank as our reality and the gloves as the se Elite bloodlines you have the picture. They are the middle 'men and women' or conduits for control between the hidden Archons and the target human population, and they are manipulated into the positions of power that run The System. Elite hybrids have a greater infusion of Ardion-Reptilian energy I genetics (virus) and exhibit tho se character traits far more than the general population. Duel virus-human DNA (frequency compatibility) allows them to be far more powerfully and completely possessed, and their behaviour and actions controlled to a greater degree.

Instead, I see something like a layer of 'shiny tar' around them in which a monst rous being in the shape of a lizard can be distinguished.

As a result of this possession our world is run by psychopaths, parasites and pathological liars (deceivers) who have no empa thy, remorse or shame. Put those characteristics together along with the reptilian obsessio n with hierarchical structures of power and you have the very personalities that have come to power all over the world creating war , division, mayhem, death, destruction and terror throughout known human his t ory (Fig 193).

When they switch from one 6e ld to the other they appear to an observer to change or shift from one form to another, but there is no physical shift because there is no physical.

Hy brid blood drinke rs Drinking cop i ous amounts of human blood, which contains the human genetic (information) blueprint, is one way they can be !>Ure to retain human form when they are not among their own. This is the origin of vampire legends and blood drinking rituals of Satanism. The most infamous blood-drinking vampire was the mass human-sacrificing Vlad the Impa ler, the 15th century ruler of Wallachia (now part of Romania). This land is, of course, the home of so many vampire legends , especially the region of Transylvania. Bram Figure 195: Vlad the Imp aler wo uld torlure people to de;ith on stakes and drink chcir blood. Stoke r 's stories about the shapeshifting, blood-drinking Dracula were inspired by the life of Vlad the Impaler (Fig 195). Vlad's title comes from the ma ss murder of thousands of people, often impaled on stake s. He would drink their blood as they slowly died all around him. Decaying corpses (Dea th Cult again) were everywhere. His father, Vlad Dracul, was initiated into the ancient Order of the Dragon by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1431 and this is one of the elite secret societies of the Archon-Reptilian bloodlines . Secret societ ies by their very nature are there to keep <:ec rets, and within the exclusive inner circles the bigg est ~ecre t is Archon-Reptilian control of human reality.

You see the pattern and get my drift. I quote at length in those earlier books Christine Fitzgerc1ld, a l ong-time close friend of Princess Diana. Christine was one of the people who described to me the reptilian nature of the royals and their participation in satanic ritual s.

Diana privately described the Queen Mother to Christine Fitzgerald as 'evil' while the 'Queen Mum' was portrayed to the public as a kind old lady and the 'nation's grandmother' (Fig 198). No wonder Diana was taken out in the Paris crash, given that she knew symbolically and literally where the royal bodies were buried, and was showing every sign that she was quite prepared to take them on. You'll find far more detail in The Pe rception Deception and The Biggest Secret and I will return to the Queen and the royal family when I come to the section on Satanism and its essential contrib uti o n to human control. I also address the assassination of Diana in The Biggest Secret . Archon-Reptilian human hybrid s are the origin of the global theme of 'royal' bloodlines claiming the 'Divine right to rule'. This really means their genetic connection to the Archon-Reptilian 'gods' the y were created to serve, as vehicles for the virus (Fig 199). Elite hybrid bloodlines (programi,) were installed all over the world to rule humanity on behalf of the Demiurge / Archons and the 'Divine Right' deal spans the globe from Europe to China, Middle East to Far East and Africa to the Americas. Chinese emperors claimed the right to rule through their descent from the 'serpent gods'. Many emperors were called dragons and described in reptilian term5 as in a 'dragon-like countenance '. Dragon I serpent / snake symbolism for royalty or king~hip is universal and can be found in Celtic society with Pendragon ('Great Dragon', or 'King of Kings'). The Book of Dzyan, one of the oldest Sanskrit accounts in India, refers to a reptilia n race called the Sarpa, or Great Dragons, which came from the skies. A Buddhist text, the Mahnuyut,:mtti , lists 80 king s descended from the Naga s, or 'Serpent Kings', and Indian rulers claimed their right to power through their descent from the Nagas who were said to shift between human and reptilian form. lndian epics say the Nagas interbred with a white people to become the 'royal' line of Aryan kings. A cobra is an ancient symbol of Archon-Reptilian hybr id s. Egyptian Pharaohs were buried in caskets wit h a headdress representing the hood of the cobra, a cobra body protruding from the chi n and a cobra on the forehead (Fig 200).

Moche was a ceremonial title in Egypt which meant something close to 'He who is anointed with crocodile fat from the Nile River '. Fat from the Nile crocodile, or 'Messeh', led to the term 'messiah' or ' anointed om•'. The Biblical ' Moses' (who was found 'floating on the Nile in a basket') comes from ' Mo s he '. Ancient kings of Media (now Iran and part of Turkey) were called 'Mar' (snake in Persian) and known as the 'Dragon Dynasty of Media' or ' descendants of the dragon'. On and on it goes. Royal Archon-Reptilian hybrids were perceived as the chosen rulers of the 'gods' and their power came from ge11efic inheritance (vehicles for the virus). A perception of royal bloodlines as the middle men and women between humans and the 'gods' has the same origins as priests being the middle men and women (sometimes) between humans and 'God'. Archon-Reptilian royalty and aristocracy are often called 'b luebloods'. Stewart Swerdlow says that he learned in the Montauk mind control programme that the term blueblood relates to the increased amount of copper in the blood of hybrids whjch makes it tum a blue-green colour in a process called oxidation.

We have a Head of State in Britain dedded by who had sex with whom, and when to dictate the hierarchical genetic succession. This has been going on for aeons since the Archon virus hijack and the seeding of their hybrid middle men and women. Some of the most significant hybrids came out of Sumer, Babylon and Egypt in the Midd le East and earlier from Asia and the Far East. Tbey expanded north to interbreed (share the 'elite' version of the virus) with other Archon-Reptilian hybrids to become kings and queens of Europe (Fig 201 ). Empires followed the bloodlines as you would expect as representatives of a force seeking to take over (infect with their virus) everything, everyone and everywhere. The Babylonian Empire became the Roman Empire as the bloodlines expanded, then the British and other European Empires . Today, with the bloodlines long established in North America, we have the American Empire in everything but name. All these empires have been empires of the Archon virus and they were the means through which ever-larger swa th es of the Earth have been stolen and controlled. From pharaohs to tribal kings, Chinese emperors to European royalty and aristocracy, Archons have ruled while hiding behind human form. You can see why they have been so diligent in protecting their genetics (virus blueprint) by interbreeding only with each other and not with the 'commoners' . This has dearly not been done to somehow maintain their superior 'intelligence' when some of the thickest people in history have been interbred royals. No, it's been to maintain something else - their hybrid genetics. Even when it appears that a commoner has been allowed into their exclusive genetic circle, as with the marriage of Kate Middleton to Prince William in 2011, further research into family backgrounds of alleged 'outsiders' reveals highly significant royal and aristocratic ancestry . There is also an Archon- Reptilian sperm bank programme that has been revealed to me by a number of people, including an unofficial offspring of the seriously Archontic Rothschild family. This allow~ children of Elite bloodlines to be brought up by other families using the sperm bank technique. These children then come through to be political leaders and other servants of The System, but they don't have the name ' Rothschild' or whatever Elite family their bloodline belongs to, so the common connections can't be easily seen. There a re enormous ntLmbers of unofficial Rothschilds alone who do not carry the name but have the b/oodli11e and are vehicles for the same Archon virus. All this is necessarv because the hybrid genetic program can quickly be diluted and absorbed into the general populat ion if it is fused with those not of the Archon-Reptilian line. Most royal marriages don't result from love or even attraction, but from genetic necessity. Many of their relationships are conducted outside of marriage, and Prince Charles is a classic case with regard to Princess Diana (genetic duty) and Camilla Parker-Bowles (desired relationship). A human genetic type that Archon-Reptilians most seek to interbreed with when they require an infusion of human genetics are blue-eyed, blond-haired people. Diana's friend Christine Fitzgerald told me that the Windsors needed Diana's genetic input because after generations of interbreeding their hybrid genetic s were in danger of becoming so reptilian th,1t their human form would be hard to maintain.

We can at least thank Boy Bush and Barack Obama for the most blatant confirmation of this. Bush was rep laced by 'Mr Change' Obama and everything continued with business as usual (Fig 202). Hybrid bl oodlines mostly swapped their crown s and coronets for dark suits and became unofficial king s, queens and princes of the political and financial classes along with those behind big busine ss, science, medicine and media. In doing so they replaced overt royal (Archon) dictatorship with a covert dark suit {Archon) dictatorship called 'democracy' which comes from the ancient Greek 'demos' (people) and 'kratos' (rule). We can see how this really works in present-day Greece with the European Union and international bankers running the country without any 'people rule' except as irrelevant, diversionary window dressing . 'Democracy' L<; based on promoting dictatorship as free choice. Key to this was not to have truly independent individual would-be politicians elec t ed to govern, but political parties. These are more hierarchies controlled by the few at the top. To be successful in almost any major political election you need to join a party to be given any effective promotion, funding and media coverage. To be selec ted to represent a party you need sa tisfy its hierarchy that you will toe the party line because, after all, you a re not representing the electorate, but the party (those who control the party). To progress up the ranks to be a minister, Prime Minister or President you have to obey the d ictates of the party and its hierarchy or - except in the rarest of circumstances - you have 110 chance. How many genuine people who don't lie through their teeth as a matter of course ever get into high political office? Each party is a hierarchical pyramid of top-down control with the few sitt ing at the capstone calling the shots and represent ing (most unknowingly) the interests of the Archon co ntrol system.

'New' parties may appear every now and then but they are soon absorbed by The System to become a duplicate of the ones they were apparently created to challenge. Now, here's a big penny-dropper. The System is a manifestation of the Archon virus and when we talk about once independent-minded people and organisations being absorbed by The System what is really happening is that they are absorbed {infected) by the virus which The System represents. How many times do you see people go into politics with apparently good intent but ending up as the epi tome of what they set out to change? Neil Kinnock, the former Labour Party leader in Britain, come~ to mind but there are legions of others aJI over the world. Alexis Tsipras came to power as Prime Minister in Greece pledging to stand firm against the imposition of crushing austerity on Greek people by the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), in the wake of the engineered debt crisis. Greeks voted 62 percent in a referendum called by Tsipras in favour of rejecting the EU I ECB I IMF economic war against them, but his former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said Tsipras decided on the night of that referen dum to surrender to the psychopaths and bullies on terrible term!', for Greek people despite all the rhetoric and bullshit. \\i\\lhat followed was an attempt to purge his party of all those who were saying what he had been saying before his capitulation to The System.

Human control comes from both Archon hybrid personnel and the stra it jacket of programmed perception and possibility ingrained by a life in the Archon-created Mainstream Everything. Add to this the need to attract votes from a population overwhelmingly programmed by Mc1in stream Everything to fear anything different or new directions, and breaking through The System politically is impossible when politics is The System. Political parties today in terms of policy and perspective are pretty much herded together on the same tin y po s tage stamp or 'political consensus' (Arc hon agenda). This is the programmed political and economic 'no rm ' and anyone challenging that norm is by definition perceived and portrayed as an ' extremist ' and usually a dangerous one. Difference s between parties and political allegiances are fractional to say the least, with the alleged political polarities ('extremes') serving the same System while only appearing to be at odds with each other. We saw a slightly different approa .ch in the election of a new leader for the UK opposition Labour Party in 2015 in the form of Jeremy Corbyn, and that was good in that he has a sense of compassion and decency , which his political opponents lack; but in the end he's still The System in another form.

Phantom Self is crucial to its success.

John Lamb Lash ~ummarises the Gnostic 'Hal' in hjs book, Not In His Image, using information from the Nag Hammadi texts: Although they cannot originate anything, because they lack the divine factor of ennoia ti ntentionality ), Archons can imitate with a vengeance.

I will come to the significance of 'fractal patterns' very shortly. Reality that we know as 'the world' , the' real' one that we think we experience as 'so lid ', is really Archon Hal-a fake simulation specifically imposed to entrap our perceptions for the purpose of ongoing control. Gnostics believed that the material world (sim ul ation) was the work of the Demi urge and not the tran scen dent 'god' or Infinite Awareness of which we are all an expression. They said that humans were sparks or droplets of the .,amc 'god' but had become trapped in the illusion of physicality. They said the 'Fall of Man' was the fall into matter (a low-frequency state). Gnostics beHeved that 'sin' was caused by ignorance of our true nature . Thjs fits 100 percent with my own writings over the years, and the 'Fall' was the point when the simulation was imposed to entice human perception into low-frequency states.

David Pincus, an American psychology professor, said this about the Cambridge findings: In the past 10 to 20 years, researchers in psychology have been finding increasing examples of fractal patterns across each of the domains of psychology: Including intentional behaviours , visual search, and speech patterns . In my own lab within the past few years we have found that interpersonal relationships are organized as fractals and most recently that the self-concept is a fractal , with complexity being associated with health in both the psychological and social d()mains . Furthermore , it appears that fractal complexity tor rigidity) is routinely exchanged among biological , psychological and social processes. Fractal personality structure helps us to grow and connect, as do fractal relationships, and each likely has direct influences on physical health by encouraging integration and flexibility among circulatory, respiratory , and immune systems. The study ... has added to much prior research suggesting that the brain exhibits fractal behaviour . This makes a necessary link between the physical processes of the brain and each of the larger scale fractals we see in broader personality and social relationships. It is clear that biological, psychological and social dynamics are highly interlinked across scales, each impacting the other over time in myriad ways. With fractal organisation at each of these sc.Jles, one may propose that they in some respects they are all part of the same fractal tree so to speak .

Those conscious beyond the program have !:>aid thi!i throughout known human history and been condemned, ridiculed and even killed for their trouble. Hum ans l oggi n g-on An ability to replicate original Earth reality doesn't mean the Archons (virus) are more advanced than humans potentially are in terms of ,,visdom and expanded consciousnes!:>. They merely know how reality works (at lower frequencies) and ensure that humans don't-hence the emphasis on controlling science and education. The Demiurge/ Archons had to achieve three things: 'Download' a copy ot Golden Age reality I simulation; lower its frequency; and then retune the human body-computer vehicle to that frequency. This is where genetic manipulation or ' interbreeding' came in. Genetic manipulation infected tlie liuma11 Body-Mi11d will, llie Pirus, which has then been replicated through the generations. All of which fits with themes of the 'Fall of Man' and humans being 'born' with 'original sin' or 'ancestral sin' (Archon virus). Sin was a major pre-Islamic Mesopotamian god in Akkad, Assyria and Babylonja. From this we get Mount Sinai (Sin was the 'God of the Mountain') and 'Desert of Sin' through which the lsnielites are supposed to have travelled. Sin's Sumerian equivalent was Nanna who was said to be the son of one of the Anunnaki brothers, Enlil. Archons created a low- frequency, 'low-resolution' copy of high- frequency Earth reality and then connected humans to the copy. Hey, presto. Those entrapped by the Archon web were now decoding the bad copy into 'physical' reaJity. They have been doing :.o ever since and it has become their 'normal' (Fig 220). Bonn University's paper on simulated realities said:' ... like a prisoner in a pitch-black cell we would not be able to see the \"walls\" of our prison' (Fig 221 ). Morpheus said in TJ,e Matrix: Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How Figure 220: The real world is a fake s1mula11on.

Hum ,1ns fell down the frequencies into the density of ignora nce. Jewish tradition relating to this good and evil theme is symbolic of profound truth s . The Fall is said to be the beginning of the mixture of good and evil, when before th ey had been separate and evil only had a 'nebulous existence'. Evil existed, the tr a dition goes, but separate from the human psyche. Human nature then did not desire it, but af t er the Fall came the 'EviJ Inclination', the tradition goes. What was at the centr e of the ' Fall' narrative? The serpent. Dr Eben Alexander said this about e\\·il in the wake o f his near-death experience: Eve n on e<1r1h there is much more good than evil, but earth is a place where evil is allov\"ed to gai n influence in a way that would be entirely impossible at higher levels of existenLe.

Phantom Self Alexander said he experienced another Earth with green, lush countryside, amazingly vibrant colour and with people happy, laughing, singing and dancing. This is how the original Earth reality- from which the copy was taken - is described. Near-death experiencers galore have told how the world that humans left behind looks something like our version, but with those vibrant colours, joy, happiness, harmony and absence of fear and its associa t ed emotions, hate, anger, anxiety, worry and stress. When their focus of attention return s to Body-Mind awareness they experience (decode) bad copy reality again with all those emotions in abundance. Emotional programs are running through the body-computer to gene.rate the energy on which the virus feeds (Fig 222). Those in only Phantom Self perception can go through an entire lifetime without having a single original thought or emotional response (see those fractaJ patterns of interconnected behaviour). High and low frequency 'Ea rths' can be symbolised as the reality portrayed in the Avatar movies in which the blue people or Na'vi were at one with animals, nature and each other while the invaders saw everything in terms of money and power . The fact the invaders were humans from our Earth was highly appropriate, as was the way they infiltrated the Na'vi world by taking on Na'v i bodies (Fig 223). High-Frequency Earth is a heart society and interacts with reality from that perspective of lnfinite Love and Awareness. Archontic manipulation has transferred human interaction within the bad copy from the heart chakra (excep t for those with some expanded awareness) to the gut chakra and in doing so inverted love into fear (Fig 224). This caused the human frequency to fall and closed the door on their frequency prison - the Matrix (Fig 225).

High-frequency Earth is about life and the Archon low-frequency inversion is dominated by death and fear of death. What is death but a distortion and inversion of life? Fear of death is the ignorance of life. There is no death for the core self only the manipulated perception of it. Death is food to the vin1s because death is an energy that syncs with ib frequency and of course a computer virus means the death of balance and harmony for anything it touches. Demiurge/ Archon worshipping Satanists are obsessed with death for this reason. War and other ma ss kiJling and suffering (distortions of life) are food- fests for the virus and allow it to spread. Conflict and suffering abounds as the virus makes it so. The realm of the Derniurge/ Archon vims is a realm of death and it is my view that Harvard academic neurosurgeon Eben Alexander experienced at least part of the Archon world during his near-death experience. He says in his book Proof of Heaven that he found hin1self in a place where he I wasn't human or even animal, but ' a lone point of awarene ss in a timeless red- brown sea'. He describes reptilian and wormlike creatures moving past him and rubbing against him with their 'smooth or spiky skins ' . Faces bubbled up out of the darkness crnd became ugly and threatening . He heard a pounding that inten sified and s ounded like 'the ,,..•ork-beat for some army of troll-like underground workers'. There was a smell - 'a little like faeces, a little like blood, <lnd a little like vomit ... A biological smell, in other words, but of biological death, not of biological life'. This is the world ('Hell') of the Demiurge/ Archons ba s ed on biological death, not biological life, and their plan is to make bad copy Earth the same.

I saw the heavens technologically projected on to the domed ceiling and it looked so real. I have since often looked at the heavens and asked the :. ame question - is it as real as it s eems to be? The high-frequency original Universe is teeming with life but b the copy? I made the point earlier about looking at the blaze of stars and believing that we are the only 'intelligent' life as we know it. The point ,till stands, but in the original not the copy (Fig 234).

They would later put the hexagram on the flag of Israel, a country which is nothing more than a Rothschild fjefdom based on Saturn (Demiurge) worship (Fig 255). The absolutely overwhelming majority of people calling themselves Jewish today have no historical or genetic connection to the land of [srael and instead originate from a people called the Khazars from the region of the Caucasus and the Black Sea. Khazars were not born Jewish but were subject to a mass conversion to Judaism by King Bulan in 740AD. They later moved north into Eastern and Western Europe to become those called Jewish in Germany (see Tf,e Pem,;tio11 Deception and Humm, Ract' Get Off Your Knees). These facts are supported by Jewish sources and historians such as Shlomo Sand, Professor of History at Tel Aviv University, in his book, The f11ve11tio11 of tire /1-\"T.11ish People. Israel was established in 1947 by a Saturn-worshipping Rothschild hoax to cause the conflict and mayhem (divide and rule) that we have seen ever since. Khazaria's king, by the way, was known as the 'Kagan' which, for the reason:, explained, became a common Jewish name to thi s today. Secret societies, religions and Establishment institutions of human society all employ Saturn symbolism profusely, including the hexagram, because they are all manifestations of the Demiurge-Saturn virus. Reality rings Dr Norman Bergrun, an American scientist and engineer, made a long and detailed study of Saturn's rings and came to the conclusion that they are not natural (Fig 256). He detailed his findings in a book, Ri11gmakers of Salum. Bergrun is no amateur. He was a scientist at what became NASA's Ames Research Center, worked for Lockheed Missiles and Space Company and Douglas Aircraft, and established his own research and engineering company. Bergrun became fascinated by the rings of Saturn after studying photographs from the NASA Voyager I ,md Il missions. They arrived at Saturn nine months apart in 1980 and 1981 and Bergrun saw blatant differences in the rings."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Figure 256: Dr Norman Bergrun, 1hp AmPrkan scientist and engineer who has done such revelatory work on tht> n,,ture oi S.-iturn . l.J7 'That was the starting point for me. I've been researching this ever since', he said. Lmages from NASA's Cassini mission, which arrived in 2004, confirmed all his conclusions. He said that some astronomers and physicists had speculated that the rings were much younger than the Universe and maybe about 100 million years old, but 'one pair of pictures shows a change in five minutes!' Bergrun realised that observations of the rings at any point were then considered definitive - when in fact that was only how the rings looked at the time of observation. He said: An impression is conveyed that latest reported measurements purport to be the true ones when , in reality, all might be quite nearly correct at time of observation. General reluctance to accept variable ring-system geometry occurs because of apparent failure to identify a physical mechanism suitable for producing recurrent change. We can't explain it so it can't be happening- usual story. Constant change in Saturn's rings was revelatory enough given the belief in their permanence by mainstream science; but Bergrun went further. His long and detailed study of NASA image, from three missions led him to conclude that the rings are made by what he calls gigantic 'electromagnetic vehicles'. When he says gigantic he is not kidding, with some of them estimated to be tl1ree times the size of Earth and more. Not po ssible once again? Consider the size of Sah1rn compared with Earth. We are not talking about the same relative perception of 'big' (Fig 257). Size is governed only by energetic information codes and click, click, enter. One person is taller than another because of il~fvrmation running through their genetics. Norman Bergrun said of these electromagnetic vehicles: 'Such an immense propulsive body implies a space engine possessing unheard-of capacity and capability.' Or a completely different form of propulsion involving electromagnetism. He does not relate the vehicles to space ships in the conventional way, but to electromagnetic energy and they can be clearly seen in NASA images (Fig 258 and 259). This begs the question of why NASA has never publicly addressed what they are - a question that cc1n be answered by NASA's true role of suppressing information that would open minds and cause a re-evaluation of Figure 257: Putting the size relation~hip of Saturn to Ear1h reality.

Presence of electromagnetic vehicles near other planets is intimated by a finding of ri ngs, the signature le ft by exhaust and emission products persisting in orbit. Bergrun refers to the substance making the rings as trails of effluent or exhaust disch a rged by the vehicles, but I would connect this to some crystalline or similar ma terial related to the transmitter-receiver systems of Saturn. He describes how jets are emitted from different points on the vehicles and each jet appears to consist of a series of ' bulbous swellings' (Fig 260). He says these are 'indicative of the form of electrically- charg ed flows known as pinched plasmas' (which I mentioned earlier). Location of the ring s is decided by the positioning of the vehicles and the 'degree of emission activity', he said. Vehicles Like those highlighted by Bergrun have been seen near our Sun, but he said that Saturn is their focus: A c oncentrated presence of them appears at Saturn, thereby introducing the interesting Figure 2b0: Material being released by Bergrun's vehicles to make the rings. speculation that the planet serves as an operational base. Ultra- superlative intellect is implied by the existence of these highly sophisticated electromagnetic vehicles . Not only do these units demonstrate mastery of nuclear power and massive electro-potential force fields, but also they show an ability to modify extensive surface areas of large celestial bodies. Indeed, a realistic pos sibility is raised that good-sized celestial bodies can be moved about. Now, what was I saying about Archons rearranging parts of the soJar system? Are the y ' vehicles' or an expression of click, click, enter? Bergrun said vehicles are pictured striking the surface of Saturn's moons (in its own mini solar system) with electromagnetic blasts. He relates the effects to the surface of our own Moon and points out that some Moon craters and scored-out landscape could have been caused in the sa me way: 'Mobile bodies of high electrical potential can entrap and disfigure celestial bodi es [and this] has implications of unforeseeable magnitude.'

A statue at CERN depicts the Vedic god Lord Shiva (Lord Archon/Demiurge) dancing within a ring. Shiva is represented by Saturn in Vedic astrology (Fig 270). He is also the god of death and time - just like Saturn. Shiva's dance symbolises the primordial destructive force of the Universe and this is the real origin of the term 'Lord of the Dance'.

Moon Mind The Moon is part of the fake reality delivery system and not real in the sense of being there by ' natural' causes . Earth's Moon is very much like the Death Star in the Star Wars movies with everything going on inside (Fig 271). The Moon is a colossa l broadcasting transmitter that amplifies Saturn transmissions and directs them at Earth (Fig 272). Saturn and the Moon are broadcasting the human 'prison for you r mind'. Soviet scientists suggested as long ago as 1970 that the Moon is a construct or part constmct because there are so many unexplainable anomalies and mysteries - including where it came from. Irwin Shapiro of the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said: 'The best explanation for the Moon is observationa l error - the Moon doesn't exist.'

Religions of the East have reincarnation as a founding principle and the way the proces~ is described sounds remarkably like the scenario I have been setting out. Buddhism, for example, portrays reincarnation as a cycle of struggle .ind suffering (slavery) known as the wheel of Samsara. The cycle is eternal until a soul's frequency is raised (awareness expanded) to allow liberation from the cycle. That , in a sentence, is what I am saying, too, from my own research and experience, which has had nothing to do with Buddhism or any other religion. I vvould say that expanded awareness (higher frequency) allows liberation from the Matrix. Saturn Ring - Pass -Not Common themes are everywhere as we can !>ee with the Nag Hammadi texts of the Gnostics. They say that :,,ouls are duped by further simulated illusion, or phmztasia, at the point of death and to escape the Archontic fake reality they had to pass beyond the planetary sphere~ of the Archons. They say the outermost of them is ... here we go again ... Saturn. This is the planet (sun) associated with death and symbolised as the Grim Reaper.

These are the insights and understandings that people need in order to break free from the prison of the mind, and the prison of perception. Awareness of what is happening and the methods of manipulation im med iately begins the process of disconnecting you from the Matrix, by bringing subconscious to conscious, hidden to the seen. Swiss analytical psychologist Carl Jung said: 'Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.' Phantom Self is constructed in the subconscious and making Phantom Self vi sible to the conscious - the point of this book - begins to disconnect us from its influence. Humanity is being subjected to a monumental program of ongoing control that Phantom Self could not begin to imagine, but Infinite Awareness is all-powerful and cannot be enslaved except through manipulation into isolated ignorance - which is what has happened.

This is defined as something 'accepted as true ' . A belief does not have to be true and usually isn't - only accepted to be true. Without unyielding belief there can be no Phantom Self and without Phantom Self there can be no Archontic control system. The rnce is on from birth to program every human to believe in som ething as long as it's not true. Layer after layer of further beliefs that are not true go on being added until Phantom Self is formed and solidified and its program is dictating perception. These programs are in the virus (original sin) running through Body-Mind but they can remain dormant, or their influence diluted, by access to awareness beyond the Matrix. Rigid belief brings the virus to life but at any moment its impact can be dissipated by awakening to Infinite Self. Programming propilganda from cradle to grave forms a bubble of belief or Phantom Self to block this awakening (Fig 292).

AJI System influences collectively confirm that you are indeed your body, name and family background, living in a solid world, and that you can be defined by the label on your trainers and the colour of your hair . 'Look, there's a ginger!' In the absence of expanded awareness saying 'Hey, hold on a second, I have s ome questions', Phantom Self goes on absorbing more and more perception programs. There may appear to be a diversity of beliefs and perception called religions, atheism, cientific dogma, political 'choice', Establishment and anti-Estc1blishment, but they are all reflections of the same Svstem and Matrix. Archons and their hvbrids know that . . beliefs and the illusion of diversity offer limitless potential for divide and rule. Belief:; invariably involve a sub-theme of limitation. This can be anything from the laws of physics to subordination to a god who both loves you and will cut your balls off if you don't do what 'He' says. Rigid belief is like a concrete bubble resisting all attempts at es cape or infiltration, and the only antidote to the virus of belief is to transfer your point of attention and self-identity from the bubble to Infinite Awareness. Many will say 'we have to believe something' but this is not the ca~e - as J will come to.

There would seem to be so many religions. l mean, whc1t diversity ... Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Buddhism, Sikhism ... the isms have no end as new ones continue to appear and subdivide into the inevitable factions arguing over the fine detail of mostly pure baloney (Fig 293). They usually begin with a focus on one person or founder and after that everything is handled through corporate headquarters (see the Vatican, Mecca, etc.). and the PR department. Religion as software is confirmed by its association with location. If you are born in India you are massively more likely to be a Hindu believer and the sc1me with Islam and the Middle East, Judaism in Israel and Christianity in the Deep South. Thb applies even to black people in the UnHed States and Africa whose ancestors were enslaved by Ouistian believers. Some slave traders wrote hymns, like Figure 293: 'Different' reltg ,ons - sa me 'go d'. Amazing Grace. The religion program involves a belief system, a deity, worshippers of the deity, 'sacred' places to worship the deity and people in frocks operating as middlemen, sometimes women, between worshippers and deity (Fig 294). Er, that's it really. Christianity= God I Jesus; Christians; churches; priests/bishops. Islam= Allah/Mohammed; Muslims; mosques; clerics/imams. Judaism= Yahweh/Jehovah/Moses; Jews; synagogues; rabbis. We see the same structure and pattern with almost aJI of them.

She immediately rejected the very idea but when a fellow Christian said that actually it was true she replied: 'Well, it doesn't matter anyway.' Concrete has set in the bubble and it won't be breached (Fig 296). If religious believers would only calmJy and dispassionately look at the evidence (not easy with the program running) they would be shocked at what the frocks are not telling them (and often the inner sanctum is not telling the frocks).

Religious Phantom Self is among the most programmed of all. I have provided detailed background to religion in my other books and I will summarise here in the context of Phantom Self. I'll pick up the story in Babylon {founded about 1,894BC) although the origins of religion go back much further as we perceive time. Babylonians worshipped a trinity of deities - Nimrod, the father god; Queen Semiramis, or Ishtar, the virgin mother; and Tammuz, or Ni nus, the son . Myths say that when Nimrod died he became the s un god Baal and impregnated Semiramis with the rays of the sun. From this union came Tammuz in a Pirgi11 l,irt/1. T.1mmuz was believed to be a reincarnation of Nin1rod and so ... 'Father and Son were one'. Babylonian beliefs were transferred by the bloodlines and their peoples eventually to Rome, and the Babylonian Trinity became the Christian Trinity of Father God (Nimrod), Jesus (Tammuz) and Holy Ghost or Spirit, symbolised as a dove. This just happens to be the symbol in Babylon of the goddess Semiramis/ Ishtar and Babylonian attributes and title~ for this goddess were attached by the new Christianity to Mother Mary- virgin mother, Queen of Heaven and such like. Easter comes from Babylon along with the Easter egg {Ishtar's 'moon egg'), Easter bunnie s {related to Tammuz) and hot cross buns. Easter and Christmas are both recycled Paganism and so is virtually every other religious festival and symbol including the cross. Babylonians didn't put crosses on their buns for no reason. The 'Christian' mitre' comes from the headgear worn by Babylonian priests worshipping the 'fish gods' under names such as Oannes, Dagon or Ea (fig 300). Remember that one of the Anunnaki brothers, Enki or Ea, was associated with water and the Zulu name for the brothers is Wowane and Mpanku - the 'water brothers' of the Chitauri who are said to have brought the Moon. How do Christians with their mitred priests symbolise Jesus? As a fisli.

Constantine had no problem changing religions because he wasn't really changing anything except the name.

Helios is translated ,1s sun in the sense of the one we see shining today, but this is the wrong sun. Helios is Saturn and we have Mithra, the Jesus blueprint, a!:>sociated with Helios and called Sol lnvictus or Uncom1uered Sun. There were once hvo suns with Saturn the most dominant in the Earth sky and the focus of worship. Heliopolis or 'City of the Sun', in Egypt, was dedicated to Saturn and an original obelisk made for Heliopolis stands to this day outside the Vatican in the centre of St Peter's Square in Rome. Why? The Roman Church (and all forms of Christianity, which came from the Roman Church) is a continuation ot the Babylonian and Roman religion - the worship of Saturn (Fig 302). Emperor Caius Caligula ordered the Heliopolis obelisk to be moved to Rome in 37 AD when Romans were openly worshipping Saturn in the 'Christmas' festival of Saturnalia (Fig 303). Rome is still the 'City of Saturn' ('City of the Sun') with more obelisks than Egypt and several from Heliopolis. Original Egyptian obelisks cue also located in London, Paris and New York, and the Washington Monument is the same symbolism (Fig 304). Obelisks are in part symbolic of the penis (bloodline) dnd translations include 'Baal's shaft' or 'Baal's organ of"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"173 Figure 304: Ori11inal Egyptian obelisks in London , New York and Paris. and the Washington Monument in Washington DC. reproduction'. Baal was another name for Nimrod (Saturn I Father God). Obelisks are used profusely by secret societies like the Freemasons although most of their compartmentalised initiates wiU not know the significance . Christianity's 'God' is the Demiurge/Saturn, and the Christian Devil, or Satan, is the Demiurge/Saturn. What a perfect hoax -you worship me and give me your energy and allegiance whichever deity you choose. You worship the God of Light? That's me. God of Darkness? That's also meeeeee! The same story plays out across the major religions. Energy flows where attention goes and worship is an extreme form of attention. This means that a focus on either the Christian God or Christian Devil creates an energetic connection to the frequency of the same deity- the Gnostic Oemiurge/Saturn. They can be combined because Saturn is infested and controlled by the Demi urge virus, as a computer can be overwhelmed and directed from its original purpose and mode of operation to become a full-blown manifestation of the virus. 'Saturn god' really means 'Archon god' or Demiurge. There was no virus in the original bad copy and Saturn had to be subsequently infected. Saturn , in short, has been possessed and become a 'fallen angel' or Archon. Yahweh /Jehovah, the Old Testament god of Judaism, is so shockingly bloodthirsty and lusts for violence, power and control because this version of 'God' is also a name for the Demiurge /Saturn. Gnostics associated the Old Testament god with the Demiurge who created the fake 'physical' reality, and, as [ have mentioned, I contend that the 'God' creating the world at the start of Genesis is actualJy the Gnostic Demiurge creating the Matrix - 'Let there be light'. The Jewish god El ('Mighty One') is their Saturn god and can be seen within the collective name of Elohim (Archons). Elohim appears in the Bible 2,500 times. An extreme Christian group based in Oklahoma call their community 'Elohim City' with no idea what the name really refers to. Saturn-day or Saturday is sacred to Jews as the Shabbat/Sabbath and the Christian day of worship is Saturn Sunday. Tetragrammaton is the Hebrew name for God that 'must never be spoken', and also appears as YHWH (sometimes YHVH), Yahweh, Jehovah, El/Elohim, Adonai ('My Lord') and profusely in the Bible as the 'Lord'. Tetragrammaton is the 'Lord Archon' or Demi urge/Saturn. A Greek form ot the Tetragrammaton was Iao 'the highest of all the gods' and ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus said lao (Demiurge/Satum) was the God of Moses.

El, the Hebrew Saturn god, is encoded within the name lsraEL, and some believe that Israel is a combination of lsis, the Egyptian goddess, Ra, the (Saturn) s un god of Egypt, and EL, the Hebrew god of Saturn. Greek historian Diodon1s of Sicily notes an inscription at Nysa in Arabia in which bis is proclaimed as 'the eldest daughter of Saturn, most ancient of the gods'. Israel's symbol is the hexagram or 'Star of David' /Seal of Solomon, an ancient symbol for Saturn and the origin of the name 'Roth::-child'. This financial banking dynasty was the driving and manipulating force behind the creation of the modern Israel on a blatant historical lie.

They interlock with each other and everv other aspect of the web. Secret societies operate by their very nature in :,ecret from mainstream society. They manipulate people and events from the hidden while making it appear to the public that ensuing events and happenings are random or the work of whoever is officially tagged with the blame. Freemasonry alone has among its ranks politicians, police, lawyers, judges, doctors , journalists, bankers, business leaders, military top brass, intelligence chiefs and people in every walk of life you need to coordinate decisions and actions to secure the outcome th.it vou want. Secret societies have the added Figure 315: The compartmentalised degrees of Fr~masonry. benefit of being so fiercely compartmentalised that only a few in the inner circle will know the ultimate game and the real force behind it (Fig 315).

'Individual' secret societies funnel chosen initiates - usually bloodline - into a higher pyramid that many call the 'Illuminati' or illuminated servants of the De mi urge /Saturn (Fig 316) .

The El-lite Propaganda Due (Pl') Freemaso nry lodge in Rom e provided a wonderful insight into secret society s tructure and method of operation when it was exposed in the 1980 s. P2 was headed by the 'Venerable Master' Udo Celli, a Mu ssolini fasci s t and close friend of Argentina's fascist leader Juan Peron, American Pre s ident Rona ld Reagan and vice-president Father George Archon Bush. Celli wa s invited to Reagan's inauguration . Documents that came to light in a police raid revealed that P2 membership included man y of Ital y's leading figures in the political, intelligence, banking, legal and media £1 -ite. Among them was futu re prime mini ster and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi . P2 member s wer e compartmentalised into sections and the head of each one was only awa re of tho se in his section. Celli and his inner circle were the only people w ho knew all the initiates of P2 and the y were interacting with each other \\vi thin the Italian establishment without knowing they were all P2 a ss et s. Secret societies work secretl y e ven with their own membership. P2 controlled the Vatican and its finances. The Rom an Church, a relocated Church of Babylon , is a n immensely significant part of the same se cret society web. At its core the Church of Rome is a central branch of Satani sm and worshipping the Demiurge/ Archon-Reptilians. They put this on public display with La Resur rezione ('The Resurrection') by sculptor Pericle Fazzini at the Paul VI Audience Hall on the border between the Vatican and Rome (Fig 317). It is claimed to represent Jesus 'rising from this crater torn open by a nuclear bomb; an atrocious explosion, a vo rtex of violence and energy.' I suggest the image takes us back to CERN, Apollyon/ Abaddon and the pas sage in the Book of Revel a tion about the opening of th e Abyss , 'a great smoking pit', from whkh a horde of demonic locusts are supposed to rise.

No post-mortem was carried o ut on the Pope to cover up the truth and the s ame network murdered Roberto Calvi, chairman of Banco Ambrosiano and labelled 'God's banker' for his connections to Va tican finances.

Satanists want to drink this because it gives these deep I y sick and possessed people a 'high'. At the same time the e11ergy generated by the terror is absorbed by Archontic demons in the unseen. Here we have the real meanin g of sacrifice to the gods. Participants in our reality perform the sacrifice while Archon- Reptilian entities absorb the energy of terror and death (Fig 320). We can't see this energy within visible Light (only its effect on behaviour) but we can certainly feel it. Go to a place of death and fear and you will be aware of the vibrntional impact. Many participants and witnesses have told me how malevolent entities (often reptilian but far from always) have manifested before them in rituals (Fig 321). This is made possible by the u se of colour and sound (chants) of specific frequencies ,md vibration that create energetic gateways and channels between our reality and the Archon realm.

I said earlier that the British Isles was the heart centre of the global ene r gy grid (most powerful vortex or neh•vork of vortexes), and this explains why these islands are (a) such a global centre of Satanism; (b) why it has been such a centre of global political and military power; dnd (c) why it is the home of so many Archon-Reptilian hybrid families and secret societies.

Archon-Reptilian hierarchy in the unseen becomes satanic hierarchy in our world on the basis of demonic entities that take possession of their human and hybrid vehicles (Fig 326).

I have said in the face of great ridicule that the British royal family are Reptilian hybrid shapeshifters who take part in satanic ritual including sacrifice (see The Biggest Secret and The Perce~1tio11 Deception) . One source talked to me for days about her direct experience of British royals at sacrifice ceremonies and other occasions when they shapeshifted (switched information fields). She is referring here to Britain's head of ~tate Queen Elizabeth ll and her late mother before she died in 2002 in her 102nd year. My source said of the Queen: I have seen her sacrifice people and eat their flesh and drink their blood. One time she got so excited with blood lust that she didn't cut the victim's throat from left to right in the normal ritual, she just went crazy, stabbing and ripping at the flesh after she'd shape-shifted into a reptilian. When she shape-shifts she has a long reptile face, almost like a beak, and she's an off- white colour.

You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears to be a frail old woman. When she shape-shifts into a reptilian she becomes very tall and strong. Some ot them are so strong they can rip out a heart and they c1II grow by several feet when they shape-shift. What she says supports the information that 1 was given by Princess Diana's friend, Christine Fitzgerald.

Royal families are always there no matter who comes and goes in politics and the same with the intelligence networks and government administration (Fig 332). A rchon paedophil ia Satanism's obsession with the energy of children brings me to paedophilia, which is so rampant worldwide the scale is almost incomprehensible. Even the FBI said in 2015 that Figure 333: Paedophiles are possessed vehicles ior Archonic entities to feed off the energy of children a nd distort their energetic fields. sexual abuse of American children was close to 'epidemic level' and there is a rea s on for this. Archons possessing paedophiles are using the abusers as a vehicle or conduit during sexual activity to draw off the child's energy from the base chakra at the bottom of the spine (Fig 333). Sexual abuse and torture distorts the child'~ energy field to rewire them mentally and emotionally for life unless the imbalances are corrected. A child's energy before puberty is like nectar to the Archon virus and here you have the major reason why paedophilia is so rife. This is especially so in the £/-lite levels of society where there are so many Archon-possessed people and Archon-Reptilian hybrids. We think of puberty as a hormonal change but this is a holographic response to an energetic information change. Archon demons want the child's energy before this change happens and they demand an endless supply of children. Don Juan Matus, the shaman source for the Carlos Ca,;taneda books, highlighted this. Castaneda wrote: ... [Don Juan] explained that sorcerers saw iniant human beings as strange luminous balls of energy, cove red from the top to the bottom with a g lowing coat, something like a coat of plastic adjusted tightly around the cocoon of energy. He said that glowing coat of awareness was what the predators consumed and that when a human reached adulthood, all that was left of that fringe awareness was a narrow fringe that went from the ground to the top of the toes. That fringe permitted mankind to keep on living, but only barely. Archon hybrids in human society run paedophile and Satanic networks that control children's homes, 'care centres' and social services or child protection (Fig 334). The shocking and ever-gathering increase in children taken from loving parents by ' child protection' agencies and placed in 'care' or forced adoption for the most spurious and ludicrous reasons is connected in part to extending control over children so they can be 'disappeared' and farmed out for .1buse, even sacrifice (Fig 335) .

If you wanted a ceaseless supply of children, which agencies would you target? Children's homes, 'care centres' and social services I child protection. E/-ite paedophile and Satanic groups even use their networks within social services and child 'protection' services to steal children to order, and this is another reason why excuses to take children from loving parents can be so blatantly ridiculous. When there is no genuine cause to remove children they have to make them up to en.sure delivery. Paedophile rings have been exposed countless times operating within the 'child care' system and they are only the tiny few that come to light. Don't fall for the assumption as most people do that the number of d,ildren that go missing can be judged by missing d1ildren stories we see in the media. Extraordinary numbers of children go missing worldwide every year and many hundreds of thousands in the United States alone. There are multiple reasons for this, but one is that many end up in the hands of Satanists and paedophiles. Their rings (ring if you go high enough) infest child protection, government, law enforcement, judiciary and the Establishment in general. These are c11l the institutions and agencies you need to control to hide almost all the abuse and bang down the lid when examples do come ·to public attention. All the abuse scandals in Britain in recent years represent a trickle of what is going on driven by the Archons' insatiable demand for the energy of children through abuse or sacrifice. The plan is to continually delete parental rights until the state has complete control of children. We are seeing this progression all the time today as schools and state agencies claim the right to dictate every area of a child's life. Scotland is one of the most disgw-,ting examples with tlie plan to impose a 'state guardian' on all children to over-.ee their upbringing to age 18 and some schools in America have agreed to have .,t.1ff from Child Protective Services in situ several days a week. This is only the beginning of where they want this to go. lf you read Brm•e Nt'lv World by insider Aldous Huxley, publi!>hed in 1932, you will sec the agenda for children laid out.

Huxley taught Orwell, real name Eric Blair, at the £/-lite Eton College where the royal children go and they became friendly. They both had access to inner-circle sources on which their books were founded and this is why they have both proved to be so prophetic (Fig 336). Predicting the 'future' is easy when you know the gist of what is planned as I have shown myself. Their books reveal different aspects of the same agenda - a police state tyranny and control through drugs and genetics. f/-ite paedophiles I exposed the VIP paedophile network in Britain involving famous politicians and others in The Biggest Secret, first published in 1998, and named names; but while the open-minded took it seriously the general response was dismissal or ridicule. The content was far too much for the perception of solidified Phantom Self to take in and, anyway, that Icke bloke is a nutter isn't he? That response has changed big-time since 2012 with an explosion of shocking revelations about paedophile politicians and child abuse rings involving the Westminster parliament and the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The Establishment cancelled the laxative order and headed for the bathroom where it has been sitting ever since. Police 'investigations' with code name after code name have been set up to seek the truth (it says here) but a~ I write years later not a single politician has been collared . Some genuine police officers will be involved and doing what they can within a command structure that doesn't want the truth to come out. An obvious cover up was instigated in which mostly C-list celebrities were used to divert attention from politicians and at the time of writing a coordinated campaign has clearly begun in sections of the British media (including the BBC as usual) to trash the idea that these political and VIP rings exist despite all the evidence (see T/11.' Perctption Deception). They are doing thjs by taking the weakest of the witnesses and targeting them while ignoring all the credible witnesses including a list of former police officers who have told how their cases involving prominent people were ordered to be dropped (Fig 337). This is a classic technique that I have explained in other books. You don't challenge the best evidence because you can't win if you do.

How these people can call themselves 'journalists' without blushing I cannot comprehend and even more so how they sleep at night. A government 'inquiry' was delayed by appointing two chairwomen so unbelievably inappropriate that they had to s tand down. One frontline witness they would have had to question was Leon Brittan, Home Secretary in the Thatcher government, who had to explain how a dossier handed to him exposing Westminster paedophile politicians and others was not Figure 338: Jimmy Savile . d ose friend of Prince Charle; a nd the roy a l fam i ly, prime ministers Margaret That c her a nd Edw ard Heath , Sat anist a nd procurer of children for t he rich ,md famous. Ni ce acted upon and then went 'missing'. The first chairwoman appointed was the sister of the Thatcher Attorney General Lord Michael Havers who was fundamentally implicated in the paedophile cover up with Leon Brittan . The second was a friend of Brittan and his wife and lived in the same street. This caused a big time delay in startin g the inquiry- enough for Brittan to die from 'long-term ca ncer' that had never been mentioned before. 'Secret' government documents were found after he died relating to his sexual activities along with other known political paedophiles. Brittan and Havers were both paedophiles and this is why they instigated the cover up. I knew that Brittan was a paedophile and yet his colleagues and friends in the Conservative Party of Prime Minister David Cameron didn't? Or Cameron's Home Secretary Theresa May who appointed the two chairwomen who had to resign - a delay that put paid to Brittan ever being questioned? Neither knew that their friend Brittan was supposedly dying of cancer and needed to be questioned with haste? Theresa May went to New Zealand for another establishment judge to be the third chairwoman and Justice Lowell Goddard is talking of many years before she will report. Phew, we've got time for the public to forget all about it. Leon Brittan is one of the men along with fom1er Pr i me Minister Edward Heath that the media campaign has been trying so hard to portray as innocent and wrongly accused. What a sick joke . The Westminster paedophile story broke in the mainstream after the death in 20'11 of a former BBC entertainer and disc-jockey called Jimmy Savile (Fig 338). He was famou s for being what they call a character when, in fact, he was a paedophile of record- breaking proportions as confirmed by police and media after a television documentary triggered the exposure in 2012 . I was told by Princess Diana's friend Christine Fitzgerald in 1998 that Savile was a paedophile and necrophiliac (sex with dead bodies ). She was my only source and with his 'good old Jimmy' image s o different to the realit y and no cross-referenced supporting s ources I \\Yas stuck. He could have sued me into the s treet n o problem.

My knowledge about Savile came from Christine Fitzgerald not the BBt. I present this brief background to Savile because from him many dots connect. First of all he was not only a paedophile but a procurer of children for the rich a11d famous. This vital fact has not come out in the mainstream, and it explains how he could go about hi!:. astonishing levels of paedophilic abuse (we now know) for decade after decade in the knowledge of the Establishment, police, intelligence agencies and members of governmen t, and still be allowed to get away with it. The collective Archon web and paedophile and satanic networks have infiltrated all these institutions and so many more. Savile was exper t in supplying children for them and they were not going to let him go down. His back was their back. Paedophile royalty Christine Fitzgerald also told me in 1998 about Savile's close connection to the royal family and how Princess Diana couldn't stand him because he was so sleazy. She wasn't wrong (Fig 339). These close associations with the inner sanctum of the royals have been glossed over but they reveal and connect so much. He was particularly close to Vlad the Impaler's bloodline relative Prince Charles (Fig 340). Medici reports after Savile's exposure said he had 'a licence to roam' in Charles ' London palace and wa~ 'granted unprecedented access across all the royal palaces up s tairs and downstairs ' . A royal correspondent wrote: 'Sa vile was so close to Charles that not only did he advise on the appo intment of a senior aide, but also sacked another figure because, I WclS told, the Prince didn't have the stomach to do it himself.' Another report suggested that Charles had wanted Savile to be godfather to Prince Harry before this was blocked by royal aides. Charles didn't know what Savile, the record-breaking paedophile and procurer of children, was doing?? Briti sh Intelligen ce didn't know while allowing him to walk through royal palaces at will? Savile said himself that he was introduced into the royal inner circle in the 1960s by Lord Mountbatten, formerly Battenberg. 'Britain's' royal family is the German bloodlin e of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

Lord Mountbatten's close association with Savile is highly significant because Mountbatten, a mentor to Prince Philip and Prince Charles, WclS not only a premier royal advisor and confidant, but also a paedophile (Fig 343). I named him in earlier books and in 2015 he was named by an abuse whistle blower for his role in the cover up of a child abuse scandal at the Kincora boys' home in Belfast, Northern Ireland. There was a reason for that-he abused children from Kincora. Two others named were Sir Maurice Oldfield, former head of M16, and Anthony Blunt, an employee of the Queen. Blunt was the Queen's surveyor of pictures, a close friend of the Queen Mother and a publicly-exposed Russian spy (Fig 344). I had named Oldfield and Blunt years before as paedophiles.

This put him much higher in the network and increased his protection. Satanism takes us into the highest levels of the Archon conspiracy and this level is afforded maximum protection and cover up, even more than non-satanic paedophilia. Savile famously volunteered as a porter to 'do his bit to help people' when he was really securing access to the mortuary for his necrophilia (Archon obsession with death). Margaret Thatcher was another close friend of Savi le during her more than a decade as British Prime Minister (Fig 346). Once again British Intelligence and police forces knew all about Savi le but allowed him to get so involved with a sitting Prime Minister as they did with the royals. Why is the mainstream Figure 347: Savile was given a papal knighthood by Pope !ohn Paul II. head of the biggest paedophile operation on Planet Earth ~nown a~ the Roman Church. media not making these points?

Everything interconnects. Recent revelations have made it clear that Thatcher covered up the paedophile nest in her government which included Leon Brittan and her two closest aides between 1975 and 1990, Lord Alastair McAlpine and MP Peter Morrison (Fig 348). I named McAlpine in Tire Biggest Secret in 1998 and repeated this again when he was threatening all and sundry with libel actions in 2012 for even hinting at hi s acti\\'ities.

The dying Australian Satanist quoted in full in Human Ract' Get off Your Kn,xs wrote this of political paedophiles: Politicians are introduced by a carefully graded set of criteria and situations that enable them to accepl that their victims will be 1 'Our little secret'. Young children sexually molested and physically abused by politicians worldwide are quickly used as sacrifices. In Australia, the bodies are hardly ever discovered, ior Australia is still a wilderness. In smaller and more densely populated countries than Australia they use private crematoria owned by sa tanic rings. I have highlighted over the years that Au!;tralia is a global centre for Satanism and its associated paedophilia and a VIP paedophile scandal erupted there as I was finishing this book over three alleged child abusing former prime ministers and other Establishment figures. The story was a repeat of what has come to light in Britain because we are looking at a global web in which each part reflects the whole and operates in the same way. Another famous politician I named in The Bigge~ l 51.'cret in 1998 was Edward Heath, Britain's Prime Minister between 1970 and 1974. Heath signed Britain into what is now the thoroughly Archontic European Union. He was Thatcher's predecessor as leader of the Con~rvative Party. l had multiple sources again and named him not only as a paedophile but as a se rial d1ild killer and Satanist. I continued to name him over the years at every opportunity . A journalist, or what pas ses for one, read Heath the passage in Tlte Biggest Secret soon after the book was published but no action was taken in the seven years he went on to serve as cl Member of Parliament before he died. Another 17 years passed before Heath's paedophilia came to mainstream attention with a series of police forces revealing investigations into claim s against him. The media refu s ed to acknowledge that I had named him as a paedophil e and much more nearly 20 years earlier. This would have been for too embarrassing for them to admit that a person they had condemned and ridiculed as a madman could have been right about such extraordinary happenings . The UK's Daily Mail even ran headline when the Heath story broke saying: ' ... no one ever rnlled Heath a paedophile .' What a joke. Those they label 'conspiracy theorists' can never be seen to be right or people might look at what else they are saying. Edward Heath is an outstanding example of how paedophilia and Satanism are intrinsically connected and how both are driven by the Demiurge/ Archon virus. I am expecting big efforb to discredit claim~ about Heath because he was a high Satanist and therefore a gateway to the darkest depths of what lies behind human control. Paedophilia is covered up but Satanism and <-atanic abuse even more so. Archon black eyes When I wa~ first told about Heath in the 1990~ l recalled a seriously strange experience I had with him years before in a television make-up room.

I walked into the room and didn't see him at first because he was behind the open door. I thought l was alone but when I sat down• and turned around there he was. I should point out here that this experience was years before I knew anything about the subjects in this book. I was a television presenter and Green politician . I nodded 'hello' to Heath but he didn't react in any way. He just stared at me in a puzzled and curious way as if he was observing something interesting. Then he lifted his eyes to the top of my head. Only his eyes moved as they scanned me from the top of my head to my feet and back again before he turned away without saying a word and looked at the make-up mirror in front of him. The most shocking part of the experience was that during the 'scan' his eyes turned jet black and I mean all of them even the whites (Fig 349). I described it later as like looking into two black holes. There was no eye contact (impossible with no eyes) and I was looking through him into blackness. I had no idea what had happened until years later when it became very clear. I was looking through 'him' into the Archon realm for which his body wa:. only a vehicle to manipulate our world. I almost doubted what I had s een because it wa s so extraordinary but I would later come acro ss legends and accounts around the world of the 'black-eyed people' which described the experience I had with Heath. Put 'black-eyed people' into a search engine and you'll see what I mean. Some movie portrayals of the 'black goo' (virus) taking over people have their eyes turning black in the way I saw those of Ted Heath. Another story involving Heath was in the 1990s when I returned to Britain from a long trip to the United States during which I had met a lot of people -12 in 15 days at one point - who told me about their direct experience of reptilian 'aliens ' and hybrids who could shapeshift between human and reptilian form. I was still compiling this information and had said nothing publicly about it. I had arranged a meeting back in the UK with a women who said she had information about Edward Heath being a Satanist. l went along to see her with no mention of what I had been told about reptilian shapeshifters. She told me that s he had been married to a Satanist who was warden of Burnham Beeches, an area of forest, copses and clearings to the west of London not far from Slough. The land is owned by the globaUy-important City of London financial district known as 'The City' or 'Square Mile' which is awash with secr et societies, especially the Knights Templar, and with Satanists. It stands on the site of the original London occupied by the Romans . 'The City' logo is two flying reptiles holding the symbol of the Knights Templar (also the flag of England) and at the point where 'The City' meets the Temple district, once owned by the Knight s Templar, you find a flying reptile statue in the middle of the road (Figs 350 and 351 ).This is where the centre of Briti s h and much of global finance meets the centre of the British (and again in many ways globa l ) legal profession.

Satanic ritual is on the bill for the inner circle an d everyone takes part in the 'Cremation of Care' ritual involving a big fire under a 40- foo t stone owl - a symbol of the god Moloch or Molech to whom the ancients sacrificed chi ldren in fire (Fig 353). The Bible says in Leviticus, 18-21: 'And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shal t thou profane the name of thy Go d.' This was a version of the Celtic Wicker Man which was set ablaze with children inside. Moloch is the Prince of HelJ in demonology who loves making mothers weep by stea ling their children and here's the punchline ... Moloch is a god representing Saturn (Fig 354). Moloch was the Saturn god of the Canaanites/ Ammonites and also called Baal (Saturn). The Star of David or five-pointed star I hexagram Saturn symbol has been cal led the Star of Moloch and Sta.r of Re.mphan (the ancient Egyptian god of Saturn). The recurring theme is obvious.

You can't abuse children without serious psychopathic tendencies. Wilfred Wong, barrister and campaigner against satanic ritual abuse for 22 years, appeared on the UKColumn Internet television show in 20J 5 to share his experience of the subject. He listed common themes in the accounts of those reporting satanic abuse as children and I have heard all of them myself from people l have spoken with across the world: • People dressed in dark robes and hoods who are d1anting, usuaUy in a language which the victim does not understand. • Drugged prior to their abuse by those dressed in robes and hoods. • Forced to ingest human or animal faeces and urine . • Forced to drink human or animal blood. • Kept in cages or hung on hooks. • Placed in coffins or buried in the ground - taken out after experiencing the terror of being buried alive. • Forced to sexually abuse other children. • Ritual sacrifice of a human or animal. • Forced to watch human or animal sacrifice and eat sacrificial victim. • Forced to participate in the killing of sacrifice. • Women or girls forcibly impregnated and later their. child is aborted and used as a ritual sacrifice or born and ritually sacrificed [that is where many babies aborted in hospitals and clinics end up]. • Death threats against themselves, their loved one s and pets if the child reveals what has happened to them. Satanic communication - symbolism Arc hontic vampiring of human energy is a constant theme and this can be done individually and collectively. We return to frequency. When humans are attached to the Archontic frequency band their energy can be trawled and this happens in ways mo st people could not imagine . The trick is to focus attention on a person or symbol that r epresents the Archon frequency and the focus makes an energetic connection with them - energy flows where attention goes. Thousands of people o utside Buckingham Palace focussing on the Qu~en or at the Vatican will make these connections and the electromagnetic energy generated by the crowds can be vampired (Fig 357). You ca n feel this energy at a sporting event when the excitement of the crowd ' makes the hairs stand up'. This is the effect of electromagnetic energy collectively generated. What we call 'a tmosphere' at mass events is simply the energy of the people and their figure 357: R:x.:us makes an energetic connection with that being iocussed upon.

Another way of hijacking focus is through symbols and this is so important to appreciate (Fig 358). Symbols are everywhere and used profusely by religion, Satanism, secret societies and the Establishment in all its forms. They are overwhelmingly the same symbols in each case and the same as those used by the ancients. The Statue of Liberty (inversion), the work of Freemasons in Paris, is holding the classic Archon network symbol of the lighted torch. 'Liberty' is in fact a depiction of the Babylonian goddess Semiramis or lshtar (Fig 359). Semiramis was known as the 'Great Queen' in Babylon and so the Mother Lodge of Freemasonry, established in London in 1717, is in Great Queen Street. From here Freemasonry was launched in the United States. A torch or flame is symbolic of illumination (hidden knowledge) and of the Archons who are also known as fire demons (Fig 360). Remember how Gnostics said Archons are made from 'luminous fire' and the Koran says Jinn are made from 'smokeless fire'. They can enter our reality through the frequency of fire - hence fire is often used in satanic ritual. Other major symbols are the eye, pyramid and all-seeing eye, hexagon , hexagram, pentagram and cube among many others (Fig 361). Eye as a symbol comes in part from the eye symbolism of Saturn and the 'all-seeing eye' of Saturn is profusely employed by Freemasonry (Fig 362, 363 and 364). Skull and bones is Saturn symbolism and relates to Saturn's astrological role as governor of the skeletal structure and its association with death (Fig 365).

Satanists have told me that on an energetic level a pentagram within a drcle appears as walls of energy which allow entities to slip through into this reality but not to escape from the pentagram energy 'shield ' (Fig 369). Satanists are terrified of their masters. Symbols are holographic projections of information fields and we need to see them in this way if we are going to understand the game. Spoken words are energetic information fields generated by vocal cords and we 'hear' them when they are decoded by the brain. We consciously hear what they say as long as they are loud enough.

Subliminal manipulation was brill.iantly symbolised in the 1988 movie n,ey Live in which special sunglasses allowed peopl e to see what others couldn't see . They realised that subliminal messages were all around them and that a non-human race had taken over by hiding behind apparently human bodjes (Figs 380 and 381). Lead actor Roddy Piper said in a radio interview in 2014 th at Tltey Live was not a movie but a dornmentary and he mentioned the information in my books. You can see They Live on YouTube and it is worth watching. Put it together with The Matrix ,md that's basically how things are. Once you bring symbols to the attention of the conscious mind with awareness of the way they work, they will no longer have the same effect because conscious mind blocks the connection. Awareness is everythin g. The System really isn't bothered so much what you believe as long as you believe something rigidly to the exclusion of other possibilities. Religion, politics, mainstream science, any rigid belief will put you in the pen as will a myopic focus on sport, celebrity, tele vision , smart phones and such like. You can watch sport in its rightful place as entertainment and still be aware of wider reality. Hey, but hold on a minute, we have to believe something don't we? No, we don't. I don't believe anything in the sense of this-is-how-it-is-and-that's-that. I have a perception of how things are at any point but I am constantly open to expanding that perception in the light of more information and insight.

We are never literally disconnected in the sense that we are all expressions of Infinite Awareness, but we can certainly be disconnected from its influence, knowledge and wisdom (Fig 382). This is especially so when a hidden force is working ceaselessly to ad1ieve that very outcome {Fig 383). lt is not our natural state to be disconnected from the ocean and we become diminished, confused and deluded whenever that happens . Leonard Cohen was so right when he said that if you don't become the ocean, you'IJ be seasick all your life.

Program perceptions of one generation, and each will program the next while believing they are doing what's 'best for the children'. Parents first transmit their programmed perceptions to their offspring in the ever-diminishing period before The System officially moves in under aliases such as pre-school, school, college and university. System-programmed teachers and professors take the programming on from the parents by repeating as fact the official truths of Mainstream Ev erything (Fig 384) .

Being non-conventional (expressing a spirit of Infinite Possibility) has to be targeted and stamped out or, nightmare of nightmares, it might catch on.

They each define self and reality in terms of limit.1tion and, in tum, this compresses the human frequency into the density of Matrix entrapment. None of th ese perceptions are true as descriptions of who we and where we are. They are experien ces and once we confuse experience with who we are (Infinite Awareness liaving the experience) then the trap is sprung and the Matrix has you. Phantom Self is basicall y an endle ss series of labels (information/ thought fields and beliefs) cemented together to confuse, delude and entrap our 'incarnate' point of attention in a prison of illusion . Without labels there can be no Phantom Self. I am using terms such as Infinite Awareness to help define and explain Phantom Self, but really there is no need for any name to describe our tme nature. We all just are and everything just is. Realms of form demand that everything is named to stop confusion with everything else, but in expanded levels of awarene ss they are not necessary.

There are others who are so totally label-gay in every fibre of their self-recognition that every other co nsideration is a distant alc;o-ran.

You see the same with the 'I am a feminist' self-identity - 'You are only saying that because yo u are a misogynist.' No, it's because I think you're talking bollocks. Jewish, Muslim and Christian self-identHy can also manifest extremes of 'I am' that make their label the only arbiter of anything. Disagree with the Israeli government's mass murdering and ge nocidal treatment of Palesti n ians and you are 'anti-Semitic'. No, I just disagree with mass murder and genocide. Israeli extremists describe Palestinians as a cancer but that is no problem it seems. Question the point in dropping to your knees five times a day while facing Mecca and you are anti-Muslim. No, I am just saying that it all seems daft to me, not that you shouldn't do it if you feel the need. And, by the way , it's my right to fi nd it daft, just as it's their right to do it. The throttle goes both ways. Label -people can't see how diminished they are by such self-identification. They could identify with being Infinite Awareness - limitless All Possibility, All Potential - having an experience as whatever the label may be.

Phantom people are expert at falling for this one whether it be world wars, conflicts with neighbours or family feuds. Nothing is too trivial, irrelevant and nonsensical to brawl over. Humani ty is so focussed on fighting itself and warring with fake and manufactured enemies that it doesn't see the force operating through all the labels - the force that made up the list in the first place. There is also the wish-I-was-someone-else syndrome that you see with white people of the New Age mind-set who desperately wish they were Native Americans or dres s a s Hfodus to mitigate the dis appointment that their skin is the wrong colour. We have extraordinary extremes of this phenomenon like the white 'civil rights advocate' who claimed to be black when she wasn't and so-called 'transabled ' who self-identify as di s abled when there':, nothing wrong with them. One academic !>aid: 'The person could want to become deaf, blind, amputee, paraplegic. It's a really, really strong desire.' It's also madness and an extreme example of how Phantom Selve s self-identify with their body. From this comes self-hatred when the body does not conform to the programmed norm. Today's real norm is for people to be overweight or at least not catwalk-perfect in some way; but programmed no rm i~ what rules perception. Does my bum look big in this?

Political correctness and Label-Consciousness trigger identity-obsession that can see no other point from which to consider or observe any question or situation. Label- obses sed extreme Jews, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, blacks, whites, straights, gays, Lefts , Rights and feminists seem to find it impossible to appreciate the view of anyone who does not reside within the perception walls of their chosen label. They will argue an d dismiss to the mo st jaw-dropping extremes to avoid saying the dreaded, avoid at all cos ts ... 'Yes, my fellow believer is talking crap on this one' or even 'I don't agree'. Valid poi nts made by another label are rejected and the chosen label must be defended at all cos ts. It is their god (or goddess), their reason for being and definition of self. They can not concede they could ever be mistaken. You see this constantly with po li tical par ties in which 'we were wrong' is blasphemy and 'you might have a point' is a prima fac ie case for execution. Another role of political correctness is to isolate groups that do not constitute a 'minority'. Majority groups in any situation are the ranks from which most of the alleged enemies of a minority must be gleaned and there can never be dis crimination against enemies, real or mostly otherwise. There is no political cor rech1ess for the majority in any situation for thi s rea son. When white people are raci ally condemned by non-white people, for example, it is a legitimate stance by an opp ressed minority; but when it's the other way round white people are called 'racists'. A black presenter on an MTV video condemning HaJloween and other d1ildren's cos tumes as 'racist' said that he hoped anyone buying a Confederate uniform for their kid s 'gets into a car accident and have to be saved by black paramedics.' Switch th,,t aro und to black people buying a costume and white paramedics and the o;tormf, on Sat urn would have some competition. Political correctnes5 is perfectly fine with that beca use this se rves the agenda it was created to serve. Such lunacy and systematic disc rimination was personified by Bahar Mustafa, welfare ,md diversity officer at Go ldsmith s College, University in London, in 2015 when she banned white people and me n from an event to promote equality.

See how labels awarded to Phantom Self go on proliferating as the Little Me virus spreads its infection and the sense of 'You' which they represent get smaller and small.er (Fig 390). 'Little me' programs are victim programs and nothing takes your power away quicker than a self-perception of being a victim of something or other. Jacques Ba.rzun, a Frend,-bom American historian, described it all very well when he said: 'Political correctness does not legislate tolerance; it only organises hatred.' Political correctness is supposed to be about diversity and tolerance when it is actually organised hatred, organised victim hood and fake tolerance imposed by extreme intolerance. Balls to that. Oh, wait. Was the use of 'balls' sexist there? Do I need gender training? I do ? Okay, tits then. Oh, it should be balls/ tits/ non-binary and you'll deal with colour later? Gotcha. CoExist House, a US and UK-based interfaith group, has called on employer s to ban ham sandwiches and sausage rolls on the grounds that Muslims and Jews might find them offensive. Not as offensive, however, as CoExist House must be to basic intelligence (Fig 391). Andy Dinham, a University of London professor who wrote the guidelines said: 'It would be good etiquette to avoid heating up foods that might be prohibited for people of other faiths ... We also say, don't put kosher or halal and other ... special foods next to another [food] or, God forbid, on the same plate.' Note that serving kosher or halal meat from animals killed in a particularly cruel way that might offend others is fine, but then as a minority they can't be politically incorrect, only the majority can. Eva Brunne, a lesbian bishop, said that Christian crosses should be removed from Swedish churches in deference to Muslims and churches should provide Muslim prayer rooms. Why .not go the whole way and remove the Bible? I reject all religion, but that's not the point. The ludicrous scale of political correctness today is the point and we've seen nothing yet if people go on acquiescing instead of saying don ' t be so bloody stupid. We reached still new levels of absurdity when the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee announced that the term 'politically correct' is now politically incorrect. Apparently its use is a 'microaggression' (see Orwell) because it suggests that people are being too 'sensitive' and are policing the language.

These factors can indeed cause them to be monumentally stupid. They say there is no fool li ke an old fool, but from my experience there are few more bereft of brain activity than an aristocratic or academic fool. 'Lord' is not a definition of intelligence and neither is 'professor'; Prince is not a term for consciousness, nor pauper a term for dumb.

Consciousness beyond the Phantom has a frequency 'hierarchy' bas ed on real choice with no one excluded, in that the more you expand your aw areness the higher the frequencies you can explore. What we have in human society is an Archon-typical inversion of this. By blocking access to expanded awareness through perception programming and other means they have been able to entrap isolated Phantoms in a hierarchical structure based on dividing those who run The System from those who are slaves to The System. In the end, irony of ironies, they're all slaves to the Archon vims . Entry to the highest echelons of the hierarchy - which the public mostly never see- is by hybrid bloodl.ine only.

Phantom Self is a software construct and the more extreme Phantom Self ens lavement the more they will be unyieldingly acquiescent to rules and regulations whether enforcers or enforced (Fig 402).

Their mentality is an extreme expression of the slaves-enslaving-slaves program. Most of the enforcers are serving a System that also enslaves them and their families and is planning to enslave their children and grandchildren with unimaginable levels of tyranny as the Archon virus pursues total control. Comp et ing to lose Divide and rule by definition requires a means of division and this is where hierarchal perception is so perfect and essential. Phantom Self by its very nature cannot identify with the infinite unity of being a unique point of attention and observation within Infinite Awareness (Fig 403). It cannot perceive itself as an expression of All That Is celebrating infinite possibility, potential and diversity. If it could it wouldn't be Phantom Self. Instead its information downloads program perceptions of an isolated individual. Figure 404: Wha t happens in a competition soc i ety controllro by those who rit; the game so ther al,,ay'S 'win'. Potential for divide and rule is therefore fantastic even before Phantom Self is herd ed into groups to be played off against other groups through religion, politics, cultur e and so much more . A disconnection from the wisdom and insight of Infinite Awarene ss leaves Phantom Self with only one source of information - the 'out there' world of Mainstream Everything. Without the filter and expanded perspective of Infinite Awareness these Archontic five-sense information sources mostly face little challe n ge on their way to becoming accepted ' fact'. A subconscious sense of isolation from lnf init e Self leads to ongoing insecurity, fear and anxiety which Phantom Self cannot expl ain or puts down to other Earthly factors. Most people will not even be aware of what I cal l background sadness or background anxiety just as background noise is not heard if it goes on for long enough. From this insecurity can come a need to control (all contr o l- freaks suffer from extreme insecurity) and a need to define o;ucces s by other Phant om Selves perceiving you as successful. TI-tis sets humanity at war with itself through wh at is known as competition. We can cooperate and no one would go hungry or hom el ess (Fig 404). Or we can compete and most will h,we nothing while the few will have fa r more than they could ever need. Competition is the offspring of the psychological dependency of being seen to succeed.

Security for those conscious beyond Phantom Self comes from within and not in external adulation or acknowledgement. This is the security of knowing that we are infinite, eternal awareness having an experience and not believing that we arr that experience. There is no need for external confim1ation of what you already are; no need for still more label:; like succe ss and failure. Phantom Self lives with a perception of isolation and can only ucceed (it believes) by 'doing better' than other Phantom Selves also living with a perception of isolation (Fig 405). 'I beat you!' No, you are Infinite Awarene ss and so you 'beat' yourself. 'I killed you!' No, you are lnfinite Awareness and so you 'killed' yo urself. Doing your best in your chosen field is not the same as competing. To do your be st is to do your best and not to define yourself by comparison with others doing their bes t. You can play football with and against others and do your best without defining th e experience by how others do. Your best wasn't good enough? Of course it was because it was the best you could do. Oh, but we 'lost' and all the cheers went to the other side? You are externalising your sense of security again. Who care s how many cheers they got and you didn't. Does our sense of self and security depend on what others think and do? 1f it does then Phantom Self has you. l have seen many stories of young lives destroyed and even ended tluough suicide bec ause of what has been said about them by the mentally deranged on social media. The troll mentality is extreme Phantom Self insecurity and allowing yourself to be aff ected by these moronic people is extreme Phantom Self insecurity. Trolls are thick as in dense and dem,e as in density - low frequency. They don't have to be but they have cho~e n to be and they can make another choice whenever they want. A need to seek se curity through your perceived place in the hierarchy involves not only climbing the la dder but also making others fall. Here we have a major reason why so many people love to see those perceived as successful brought crashing down and if they can play a pa rt in that demi se even better. I can't get up the ladder so next best tl1ing is bringing oth ers down to me. I have taken unimaginable abuse over 26 years and still do so from Ph antom Self extremists; but I don't give a shit.

It doesn't matter what peo ple tl1ink about you, only what you think about you. Another consequence of Ph antom Self dependency on externalised security is that to attract confirmation that yo u are successful you must succeed according the symbols and definitions of success dic tated by The System. This is a major vehicle through which The System dictates and limits choice. Once you have programmed the definition of success, which largely co mes down to fame, status and money, you have set the ambition criteria for Phantom Se lf in need of externali sed security.

Reacting without thinking can be necessary when ~ omeone walks in front of your car and the reptilian brain slams the brakes on without any debate about whether to do so. Thank goodness when to take time to ponder could be fatal; but reacting from the survival instinct before other parts of the brain can calmly think is also fatal to Fig u re 4 07: 9/11 wa~ a classir Problem - freedom if the survival reaction becomes the governor ReaLlion-Solution. of all perception and behaviour.

We see reptili . an / amygdala responses v.'hen people react in an over-the-top manner or even violently and then say 'Oh, my, god, what have I done?' Panic is a trait of the reptilian brain in the face of perceived threats to the survival of whatever is perceived to be under threat {Fig 406) . .Put this reptilian brain I amygdala reaction system together the left-brain I reptilian brain relationship with hierarchy and you have the reason why the mass manipulation technique that 1 have dubbed Problem-Reaction-Solution {PRS) is so enormously and constantly effective.

The term 'journalist', when applied to the mainstream variety, is another inversion - with honourable ex ceptions. Journalists are supposed to tell people what is going on when they don't kn ow what is going on. Investigative journalism is largely reading the morning papers a nd watching the rolling news on the new s room telly with 'journa li sts' telling 'jo urnalists' what is happening who then repeat it as fact.

He clearly beHeved from the way the conversation went that l was going around the world doing Christian evangelist-type 'healings' like some British Benn y Hinn. How had he come to this ridiculous conclusion? By passing through his off-the-peg pe rception processes the nonsense written by his fellow ' journali s ts'. These are the pe ople that stand in the pivotal position between what is happening and what you are t ol d is happening and to them the very idea of a global conspiracy is way beyond their ca n't-get-my-head-around-that capacity for free thought.

A year to the month after the document was published came 9/11-what Bush called 'our Pearl Harbor' - and this wa s used to kick-start the process of picking off country after country on their list while blaming the attacks on 'Islamic extremists'. Mohamed Atta, the alleged 'terrorist leader ' on 9 / 11, was such an Is lamic fanatic that he had a white, non-Muslim American girlfriend, took cocaine, drank heavily nnd his favourite food was pork (see Tlze David lcke Guide to tire Global Conspiracy and Alice i11 Wo11derla11d a11d tl,e World Trade Center Disaster) .

General Wesley Clark, NATO's former Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said in a t e levision interview on a non-mainstream s tation in 200 7 that wars in the Middle Ea s t and North Africa since 9 / 11 had been planned at least by 2001 (and in truth long before). He said: About ten days after 9/ 11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz .

The 'war on terror' launched as a result of the engineered 9 / 11 has been used to target countries on the original pre-9 / 11 list, using different manufactured excuses for each one in an attempt to hide the common force behind them all, and used also as an excuse to deJ ete freedoms at home under the pretext of protecting the population from terrorism (Fig 4 16).

This sa me ignorance then condemns and ridicules those who are informed and dubs them 'conspiracy theorist s' - a term invented by the CIA to discredit those exposing the Prel'>ident Kennedy assassination and other connected events in the 1960s including the assassinations of Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. (Fig 417). The arrogance of ignorance is at work once more, but Phantom Self believes them anyway. A quote from writer Stephen King sums it up: 'The trust of the innocent is the liar's most m,eful tool.' It's not only the tmst of the innocent; it is also the trust of the fearful. Phantom Self is wracked with fear - the fear program is running through body software - and this makes them open to being told what they so want to be true. Which is the easiest way to being believed? Telling people what they d on't want to hear or telling them what they do? It may not be nice to be told that Muslim hijackers were responsible for 9 / 11 or that banking greed and incompetence was the only cause of the crash of 2008.

It appears to in-denial Phantom Self to be so much easier to condemn or shoot the messenger than have the courage ,rnd maturity to consider the validity of the message . Divide and rule programs make people far more likely to rush to condemnation and support war s of 'solution' if the official perpetrators are from a different sub-program. Christians are far more likely to support attacks and consequences for Muslims than they are for fellow Christians, and once you have demonised one group you return to d\\.'monise the group that you exploited to demonise the first group. Pastor Martin Niemoller famou sly .;;aid this about Nazi Germany: First they came ior the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist.

The refusal to comprehend a long-planned conspiracy ('they would never do that!') or to commit any thought or research to the possibility makes Phantom Self a sucker for the stablemate of Problem-Reaction-Solution, a technique that l call the Totalitarian Tiptoe.

The European Union dictatorship has been made possible by this technique as it progressed from a free trade area to a centrally-controlled bureaucratic superstate consuming the sovere i gnty of nations with every new step.

Europe's nation5 should be guided towards the super-state without their people understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps. each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually anrl irreversibly lead to federation . This has clearly happened and the crushing of Greece and its people is but one example of using engineered financial exc u ses to justify ever more centralisation of power. We reached still new extremes when Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's constitutional president, refused to appoint a lef t -wing coalition government that won an absolute majority in the Portuguese parliamen t because it was sceptical of the EU and wanted to challenge its debt policies imposed on Portugal. Neither Greece nor Portugal is any longer a democracy and every other country is planned to follow . They get away with it because most Phantom Selves are consumed by their own de s igner myopia. lt may be family, job, sport, hobby, television or celebrity, anything that takes your eyes off the panorama of unfolding events (Fig 419). You n eed at least some connection with Infinite Awareness and certa inly an active right-brain to see that panorama. A good example of Phantom Self tunnel vision are the Trade Unions that rejected a proposal by the UK Labour Party leader nut to spend £100 billion (and the rest) replacing the Trident nuclear weapons system. They said they had to defend jobs in the 'defence sector'. Actually, it is t he attack sector, but the point is that what potentially impacted on the unions was more i mportant than the consequences for the wider world and mass murder of the innocent by the weapons made by their members. Alternative employment that could be generated by the same £100 billion (and the rest) passed them by in their peripheral vision. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said: 'I understand the moral case and the huge cost of replacing Trident , especially in this era of austerity , but the most important thing for us is jobs and the defence of communities.'

Crucial to this end is for Archon hybrid networks to divert attention from what is happening in the same way that a magician wants you looking at one hand while the trick is done with the other. We can see this in its simplest form when governments make unpopular announcements on days when big stories are dominating the news. The Pentagon announced that trillio11s of dollars had gone missing from its budget with il news release on September 10th 2001, knowing full well that what was going to happen the next day would ensure that this staggering revelation would hardly rate a mention in the media. Magical tricks of perception diver s ion go much deeper and include five-sense pap and crap of social media, television and celebrity culture (Fig 421 ). Look at this, listen to that, feel this, smell that, taste this. Aren't the senses great - they're all that exists, you know. The System spews out a constant stream of diversioru, to focus attention on irrelevance and it's the ultimate attention seeker. Phantom Selves that fall for this just trot along with blinkers in place focused on their own particular interest and leaving the manipulator s to go about their bu:.iness unchallenged. John Lennon made the point in Working Class Hero about people being kept doped with religion, sex and TV while thinking they are so clever and classless and free; but, as the next line says:' ... you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.' Football and sport in general are great examples. I like watching football to a point but I know it doesn't matter in that whichever side wins no one dies, goes hungry or bombs the innocent. You would not think this, however, when you observe the sheer hatred that can be unleashed over people kicking a bag of wind about (Fig 422). Talk ,,bout Phantom Self. Tribal programs are activated and spark reflex-action hostility between rival groups of supporters . The closer the clubs are located the greater the hostility - precisely what happens with tribes. If only people would get as worked up about the door banging shut on their freedom and their family's freedom; but, no, the blinkers are on and they are painted in the colours of City or United, Barcelona or Madrid. While I was writing this book, Raheem Sterling, a young player with Liverpool football club, said he wanted to leave and play for a more successful team. The abuse that follovved was both shocking and Phantom Self in all its cockeyed stupidity. There were thre<1t s against his three-year-old daughter and the wish expressed that Sterling's shirt would be 'soaked in your own blood'. He's a kid, it's a game and there are peopl e"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"ll ,t e Drop ,n the Ocean 2.H in psychiatric wards for far less. When Sterling played for his new club opposition fans booed (what a pathetic sight that is) every time he touched the ball as they responded like parrots to the abus e dished out to Sterling by 'journalists' and others who would ha ve done exactly the same had they have been him. The football diversion alone is such that we have people dying through lack of money and living in abject poverty while football ers are bought and sold for more than £80 million and some paid ten s of millions a year for kicking a ball about. Yes, very skilfully many of them, but it's still a ball being kicked by their feet. Football clubs ar e increasingly owned by fake Arab 'royalty' who have stolen oil reserve s from the Ar abic mas ses; oligarchs parasiting off their masses; and money-obsessed, masse s-exploiting corporation s. Meanwhile football ma sses pay outrageous ticket prices and buy televi s ion subscriptions to fund thi s grote s que global pig-trough. Football, the sport of ' the people' and the 'working clas s' , ha s been hijacked by the £/-ite money-class, while s o many of the curr e nt ' working class' are quite happy with that so long as the £/-ite use their billions - secured from football and the efforts and labour of the 'working class' - to buy footballer s at stupendous cost to make their team win. They piss on us and we say it's raining. Phantom Selves ,,t this level of programming could never see the outrageous nonsen se of this when their s en s e of what matter s is focussed on a dot and not a picture. Phantom Self perceives everything through a microscopic mind where only dots exist, not pa noramas. To quote George Orwell again in 1984: 'Football, beer and above all gambling filled up the horizons of their minds. To keep them in control wa s not difficult'. This applies to any 'dot' that hijacks attention and di storts perspective and T he System turns them out by the million. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with enjoying sport and other pastimes. The key is seeing them for what they are and removing blocks to peripheral vision where the magicians work. ' Spir i tual ' and 'R adical ' Phantom s Phantom Selves aren't always as obvious and on public display as Raheem Sterling's abusers and tho s e who believe that what s ome celebrity po s ts on Twitter actually matters in the great scheme of life . There are hidden Phantoms and by hidden I mean as in hiding themselves from themselves and seeking to do the s ame to the world. They invariably succeed with the first goal but often less so with the second. Sadly , they often think that they do and confuse hiding themselves from themselves with hiding themselves from others. The latter is much harder though far from impossible as hindsight constantly reminds us. These covert {to themsel ves) Ph , mtoms include Spiritual Phantoms and Radical Phantoms. The New Age ar e na is awash with Spiritual Phantoms who talk about love and light and 'we a re One' while behaving in every way like a blueprint Phantom . They think they've 'got it' when 'it' has got them. Not all New Ager s and 'radical s ' are like that by any means , but many are. I have had New Age 's tars' in the United States slag me off for the sort of information I am revealing in thi s book because their alleged 'open minds' are not open enough. I appeared in a documentary with s ome of them once and they wrote an open letter to the producers c omplaining that I had been included without them knowing. They thought it might damage their 'credibility'. Spiritual, right? One of their points wa s that I was que s tioning vaccinations. You have got to laugh or the tear s would flow. I have had 'alternative' bullshitters pa ss through my life who talked their fairyland self-deception"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"234 Figure 423: Walking the tall,.? No, running the rail,..

'All mouth and trousers' as my father used to say and some of these 'spiritual supporters' have gone to newspapers to sell their 'story' for 30 pieces of silver while stilJ considering themselves 'spiritual' as they cashed the cheque. The scale of sell-deceit chills the spine. Many New Agers and radicals tell people to 'let go of fear' while they have balls akin to nanotechnology (Fig 423). These fakes lie, manipulate, exploit, break confidences, seek to undermine and hurt, while aU the time proclaiming that everyone should love each other and come from the 'heart'. SpirituaJ Phantom is so consumed by the program and its own self-deception that they can hide the part that does the deeds from the part that does the words. I remember one told me in 2015 that it was a shame I had not stayed on 'the path'. I take it that he meant his version of 'the path' which involved, from observing his Life, doing absolutely damn aU unless it suited him and avoiding anything that would get his 'spiritual' hands dirty by facing the rea1ity of the human plight and doing something about it. 1 can only think from my own experience that for many a lack of humility and self-reflection (and ball-removal) are prerequisites of New Age membership. Spiritual Phantoms are some of the most programmed of all in that part of them speaks against the program while the other lives it and serves it. Cognitive dissonance in extremis - 'simultaneously holding contradictory or otherwise incompatible attitudes and beliefs.' Their 'spirituality' is externalised in words and postures instead of coming from a connection with Infinite Awareness (Fig 424). They ~tand as a warning to aJI of us that Phantom programs can still control you when you think you are free from them and self-deception is an essential component of Phantom programming. Being honest with ourselves and on constant guard for Phantom influence is vital to unravelling the program. It is easy to condemn the actions of other s while convincing omselves that we're not doing the same when we are. 'If you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself', as OrweU put it. Those that have caused me most stress and most challenge to my health and work over 26 years have been those who most said they wanted to help me. What I was uncovering and communicating was 'so important', they said. This was a!J fine while they were benefiting from what I do but once that changed Spiritual Phantom transformed immediately into the extreme end of Classic Phantom.

They were and cUe drowning in resentment and hatred while still pontificating about love and light and running websites claiming that the people must 'wake up'. Starting with themselves might be helpful. Spiritual Phantom's cognitive dissonance builds a wall between the self-deception of 'I am loving and spiritual' and the self-reality of 'Fuck you, I'll bring you down and love it.' This wall is in many ways located in the corpus collosum that connects right-brain to left and it is certainly located in the disconnection of Phantom Self from Infinite Self. Spiritual Phantoms talk right-brain and act left. Jiddu Krishnamurti said: 'Violence takes many forms. not merely brutal action, striking each other ... ,·iolence includes imitation, conformity, obedience; it exists when you pretend to be which you are not.' You can spot a Spiritual Phantom OT any other by their obsession with self. Me, me, me is its calling card and when you dose your ears to the words and just watch the actions the real agenda and motivations are easy to see (Fig 425). This is a good way for everyone to scan themselves for Phantom Figure 425: Spirilual Phantom assessing priorities. Figure 42b: They disagree with me - silence them! programs and bypass self-deception. Close your ears to your words and watch your actions. Another example of Spiritual Phantom and Radical Phantom are those who demand freedom of speech but then call for others to be silenced when they don't like what they're saying (Fig 426). I have been subjected to thb over the years by the cognitive dissonance of Radical Phantoms who are mostly found in arenas known as Left and Green, but also in other groups. Zionist Phantom extremists would love to !>ilence all opposition while saying how important it is to have freedom of expression. The contradictions are so obvious to anvone with even a smear of connection to e>.panded awareness but Phantom software is programmed to block this. It is another version of the me, me, me program. Free speech is for me because what I am saying is right and fair, but not for you because you are dearly wrong by saying something different to me. A bloke campaigning against my right to speak in public once said: 'What benefit is there in allowing him to speak?' His speciality, apparently, was human rights. l remember speaking to a policeman many years ago who was dealing with a bunch of Radical Phantoms protesting outside an event where I was speaking. He said that he had been on duty when marches by the far right National Front had been opposed in the same area by marches of the 'radical' Left. His point was telling. He said that if it wasn't for their different banners he would not have been able to tell them apart by the way they behaved. Phantom Self is a collective program.

Radical Phantoms think they are challenging The System when they are essential to The System, which needs to divide and rule and hide its centrali sed contro l b ehind the iUusion of diversity. 'Alternative' Phantoms Spiritual Phantoms and Radical Phantoms are legion in the alternative media which has exploded in the wake of world events and the information that pioneers were circulating when few wanted to know. The term 'alternative media' covers a vast spectrum of people, attitudes and beliefs th at span the chasm between those barely different from the mainstream in beliefs a nd approach, to those like myself at the oth er end who are questioning the entire Mainstream Everything to its very core. This colo ssal spectrum of belief and perception means that most of the alternative media is acting from the perspective of one Phantom program or another. By that I mean that its advocates are coming mostly from a belief system that attaches them to The System. Maybe they believe in the world view of mainstream science or they are coming from the political Right or Left. Many in the United States are Christian believers, another Archontic creation as with religion in general. What is called · alternative' media includes some seriously off-the-scale Old Testament extremists and here-today-gone- tomorrow self-promotors along with some of the most decent people you could ima gine who genujnely want an end to the jnsanity of division and for people of all colours, creed<; and cultures to come together in mutual respect and support. The only theme that connects them all is that in some way they challenge the propaganda and deceit of the mainstream media. I have been able to witness all this personally given that l am challenging all belief systems of Mainstream Everything. I am not saying that people shouldn't have the right to hold those beliefs. I am only questioning their validity as explanations of the world and pointing out that their origin can be located in the Archontic conspiracy. This has led to an inevitable response that has s een me attack ed, abused, dismis~d and ridiculed by most of the alternative media every bit as much, and often more, than even the mainstream. You know you are on the right track in questioning Mainstream Everything when those who normalJy attack each othe r turn on you with a unity never seen before. Religious advocates don't like me becau se I question its basis; the Left call me Right and the &ght call me Left because in truth I reject them both - and all in between; Zionism calls me anti-Jewish because I expose its manipulation and slaughter of the innocent in Palestine; Muslim group s have sought to condemn me because I say their religi on is a control program; many in the New A ge don't like me exposing the force behind world events on the grounds that it is apparently negative and frightening fo r those who urge people to 'let go of fea r '; talk of' Archons', 'Reptilians', Moon, Saturn and simulated reality obviousl y blows the gaskets of virtually all of them.

You are not free of Phantom Self just bec,,use you believe that 9 I 1 l was an inside job. It goes waaaaaaay deeper than that. 1 see comments on the Internet and social media from people who think they are ' alternative' which are still so me-centric, so Phantom Selfish, instead of supporting the common cause. They label people who are out there exposing what the public need to know as 'CIA' or 'Intel' with no evidence whatsoever and the best one is '[f you were genuine, you'd be dead'. Well, why aren't they? Talk about handing your power to that which you claim to be challenging. They infight among themselves and so do the work of the very force they say they oppose. Phy s ician heal thyself, as the saying goes. In the end, it all comes back to being honest with our selves and scanning actions, attitudes and behaviour for Phantom programming. No one is immune but we can be constantly self- aware and so constantly dilute the influence. The alternative media has done a brilliant job up to this point and I salute everyone who makes an effort to break the main s tream ::i tranglehold in any peaceful way that suits them; but the great majority in that field are c; till walking around the rim of the rabbit hole and have not even entered it yet. This should be the next stage . Until minds are opened and Phantom programs cast aside they'll never s ee the full magnitude and depth of what is happening. and what needs to be known . They might - everyone might - ponder again on the fact that we can see only an infinitesimal fraction of what exists and even that is perceived through the filter and se \\'ere Limitations of a biological computer programmed to squeeze our perception of reality. It is not only arrogance to think that given these facts we can dismiss possibilities without question or research - it is pure self-deluded stupidity. Sup er Phantoms Bloodline Phantoms and others so profoundly infected (possessed) by the Archon virus that they basically are the virus, are what I call Super Phantoms. 'Psychopath' Hts the bill here and while many associate this term only with serial killers, it means far more than that. Professor Robert Hare, a criminal psyd1ologist, worked with psychopathic people for decades before compiling his 'Hare Test' definition of a p syc hopath , which includes the following traits: glibness and superficial charm, grandiose sense of self- worth, pathological lying. cunning I manipulative, lack of remorse , emotional shallowness, callousness and lack of empathy, unwillingnes s to accept responsibility for actions, a tendency to boredom, a parasitic lifestyle, a lack of realistic long-term goals, impulsivity, irresponsibility, lack of behavioural control. Professor Hare said: 'It stuns me, as much as it did when I started 40 years ago, that it is possible to have people who are so emotionally disconnected that they can function as if other people are objects to be manipulated and destroyed without any concern.' I have been making this very point for decades about Archon-Reptilian bloodlines and this is the wakeup call for those who say 'they would never do that'. No, you would never do that; tlzey would and /m,e it. Ima gin e if you had no empathy or remorse for the consequences for others of y our action s. There would be no emotional fail-safe mechanism to stop any scale of violent and abusive behaviour, nor regret after the deeds were done.

They even get off on the suffering and mayhem they wre ak (Fig 429).

To see the empathy-deleted almost sexual rush that some lawyers get from vanquishing their targets is a sight to behold. Those who only associate psychopaths with serial killers will think they are not that common. This would be a major misunderstanding. Human <;ociety is infested with psychopathic behaviour. The world is run by psychopaths and they hire other psychopaths at all levels to administer The System for them. These are the ones Figure 431: Ps yd10paths and th~ controlled by psychopaths= armies everywhere. 239 who mostly (not always, but mostly) end up in positions of power and hire and fire throughout global society. Pharmaceutical and Biotech industries are playgrounds for psychopaths, and so is journalism in the case of those who gleefully destroy lives without any public interest relevance whatsoever. The military are trained to be psychopaths and to be subordinate to psychopaths and unquestioningly follow their orders. Ps yd10p a ths in the military then go about their slaughter for the psychopaths in government who are me re vehicle s for the psychopaths in the shadows who are agents of the psychopathic Archons and the psychopathic virus. Troops that are psychopaths have no problem at .:ill killing the innocent and destroying lives and countries. Those who are not often suffer serious psychological consequences for the rest of their lives. Show me a soldier who doe s not deeply regret what he or she did to civilians and children and I will show you a psychopath (Fig 431). We se e psychopathic criminals, organised crime, drug dealers, people-traffickers and those who coldly trick the elderly and most vulnerable out of their life savings to leave them with nothing. So-called 'suckers lists' came to light in Britain in 2015 with the name s of 200,000 people compiled by criminals (psychopaths infe s ted by the virus) to be targeted with money scams. Most were elderly, with one 87-yea_r-o)d specifically targeted becau s e her husband had just died. She lost £90,000. No empathy, no remorse - Archontic psychopath!>. The scale of psychopathic behaviour is astonishing when you take thl'.' trouble to observe the world and this is a manifestation of the virus replicating it::.elf. Social media and the [nternet ha s allowed us to se e the scale of psychopathy that we couldn't s ee before. Trolls and abusers who delight in the hurt they cau se to others Me psychopath:,. No one is immune from psychopathic traits, however mild, with all human body-computers infected with the virus ('original s in'). The question is how conscious are we beyond Body-Mind to override the impulses of the psychopath program. If we look through our lives we will all find examples of acting without empathy (though usually far less so without remor se). Actions that inv olve no empathy and no remor se are a s till higher level of psychopathy . For most people these are moments, but for many (especialJy those in pow er and others Like Internet trolls) psychopathy is their very being as a Super Phantom.

The potential is there in everyone for the rea sons I have explained and The System is constantly seeking to activate those traits with its actions and propaganda. Violent video games are a part of this to desensitise pe ople to violence and suffering. You also see psychopathy with a Problem- Reaction-Solution terrorist attack blamed on those from a particular country, and the common respons e of 'bomb the bloody lot of them'. This is the psychopath program being activated. Another major trait of a psychopath in the Hare Test is a 'parasitic lifestyle' or living off the efforts of others. The term is defin ed as 'an organism that lives and feeds on or in an organism of a different species and ca u ses harm to its host' and 'one who habitually take s advantage of the generosity of other s without making any useful return' . My god, I've known some of those. Observe the world and it all makes sense . The Archon virus which infects human society is par as iti c to its foundation and operates in hierarchical structu res. Human society is a parasitical hierarchy in which higher levels of the power structu re parasite off those below, and this continues down into the lowest levels with, for example, a lazy partner parasiting off the other and criminals from a deprived estate stealing from others in the deprived estate. The parasite program is holographic like everything else in our perceived reality and you find it everywhere right down to the parasites that feed off the body and each other. Cancer, one of humanity's biggest killers, is a parasitical fungus and a blood y stupid one because by killing the body it kills iL<;elf. Parasites are not usually very bright which is why, I guess, they are parasites. Cancer is also psychopathic in that it cause s death and suffering without empathy or remorse (everything is conscious). Psychopaths and parasites are traits of the same program, which is active throughout the fake Matrix and everywhere the virus infests. To understand Phantom Seit and its many and various expressions and programs is to understand ourselves and human behaviour - and to understand the world.

The virus can be eradicated - and will be - but a first and fundamental step is for people to realise they are slaves of the Hidden Hand and to understand the modus operandi of opp ression and manipulation. How can slaves cease to be in slavery while under the illusion they are free? I have described the origin and depth of human control. and in the next few chapters I am going to show how this plays out in daily life as 'random' events that are all coor dinated in pursuit of a common goal. The Archon Control System perpetuates its mass slavery in two main ways: Method one is to control people through violence and a merciless police state so the population know they live in a tyranny, but are too frightened to do anything about it even though they are the great majority and the ir opp n~~ so rs a small minority. Method two ('democracy') is to control and dictate choice and events while deceiving people into believing they are free. The plan with current 'democracies' is to accrue so much power at the centre that they can move from method two to method one and we see this happening today ever more clearly. Hijacking choice while promoting this as Wl!J ~lit!)~ free choice pervades The System and infiltra tes all aspects of life. Jf 1 offer you a choice of A, B or C you can think you are making a free choice by picking one of them; but A, Band Care not the only choices that you can potentially make. There are billions of others and, ultimately , infinite others. Those three from which you make your 'free' choice are o nly the ones being offered (Fig 433).

Governments also have no legal obligation to do what they said the y would do (or not do) when lying to the electorate to secure sufficient votes to win power. 'Democratic' government is a joke and has nothing to do with poLitical representation of the populous and yet the right to vote is the constantly-quoted sym bol of this 'you are free' confidence trick. You can vote so you mu st be free, and you can choose the government so this must be government by the People for the People . But for this to be true there must first of all be choice in how a society is run and the directio n that it takes. Yet all that is offered in the 'free democracies' are political party masks on the ame Archontic face - and this is 'choice' scuppered before a single ballot is ca st (Fig 435). Once a mask or 'political party' is officially elected it can go its own way (as it always planned to do) with little or often no regard for the election promises through which it attracted its electoral support. Wi shes and desires of the population only h ave to be considered again when the next election is close and the entire farce is repeated . Thl s has been the case throughout the history of 'democracy' and still so many peopl e can't s ee how they are being systematically shafted. They continue to campaign for the masks and argue with other masks over which mask s hould be pinned to the unchanging face this time around. You don't lik e thi s mask after its years in government? No problem. You can now have another mask and when you eventuall y reject that mask because it is doing the s ame as the previous mask, you can choose to go back to the other mask once again.

Tho se that covertly co nt rol the political parties make those decision ~ along with corporations and individuals who fund them and the media that builds them up and knocks them down.

Corbyn has been attacked and undermined from day one by large sections of th e British media for the political crime of being a bit different- in an attempt to ensure he never gets into government. By the way, talking of corporations - countries and governments are actually private corporations operating under commercial and maritime law. I have exp lained this in other boo ks, and specialist researchers on this su bject have also done so in great detail. The term 'United States ', for example, does not refer to a country but a privately-owned corporation with the president knott'Tl as the President of tlle united States.

Next question: What governs your d1oices throughout your life such as what yo u do, where you go, where you work , if you work, where you live and even if you live (see 'if you eat' and 'if you have health care')? This can be answered in one word - money . Who controls money and therefore all of those choices and potential life -paths? The same force that decides who is in government, and the same is the case with centres and institutions of power the world over. Archon-Reptilian hybrids created and control the carte ls of Big Banking; Big Politics ; Big Oil; Big Biotech; Big Pharma; Big Food ; Big Media (including Hollywood) ; Big Internet and so on. This is possible through what I have called The Blueprint or Spider's Web, a global network of secret societies, semj-secret groups and those operating in the public arena such as corporations and government~.

Th is is how the same force control~ The System while making the wo rld appear to be random and diverse and by controlling perceived norms through control of consensus reality.

Without choice and with subsequent dependency (on The"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"--- we·re. Free. Honey System) there is a single word to describe v,:hat this means ... slavery. American journalist Ellen Goodman described this very well when she wrote: Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work and driving through traffic in a car that you arc still paying for - in order to get to the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car, and the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it. 1 have exposed the banking and financial system and its second-by-second manipulation and cormption in fine detail in other books (see Archon Economics in Tile Perceptio11 Deception) and it will Figure 445: Shocking, but true suffice here for new readers and essential dot- connections to describe what money is and how it 249 comes into being. How extraordinary in the extreme it is to observe how few people even within the financial community know where 'money' comes from. This is especially so when who has money and who doesn't is !-uch a basic and profound dictator of human experience. If you have never come across this information before prepare to be gobsmacked. Money is only worth what people believe (are manipulated to believe) it is worth. Er, that's it. Money is actually worth nothing once buyer and seller s top believing it has worth. Coins have Little value in themselves in terms of their metals, while paper and digital money have no value whatsoever outside of that officially ascribed to them. Money is all illusion and engineered perception . One day a pound sterling or a dollar can be worth so and so (in theory) and the next a different so and so (in theory). All that has changed is the belief in what it is worth because of some stock market or currency market rumour or government/ centraJ bank decision or circumstance. Money is worth, in other words, what 'They' tell us it is. There was a time when money was valued in relation to commodities like gold but that has long gone. We now have 'fiat' currency, which is only worth anything because governments say it is (Fig 445). Definition of fiat currency: 'Paper money or coins of little or no intrinsic value in themselves and not convertible into gold or silver, but made legal tender by fiat (order) of the government.' Fiat has a Latin meaning of 'Let it be done', 'It shall be'. Fiat money has no intrinsic value beyond the government saying 'it shall be' and yet when people 'borrow ' this stuff they have to buy it in the form of interest. Should they be unable to repay this intrinsically valueless 'loan' plus interest then the lender (bank) can take what they mvn that does have intrinsic value - their home, land, business etc. The world is being stolen through this global s cam by Archon bloodlines that not only control the political and financial systems, but created them with the Rothschild.\" pre- eminent and they Me run by secret society and satanic networks doing the work of the Spider (Fig 446). Today's banking system can be tracked from ancient Babylon (again) through Rome (again) into Europe and worldwide. 'Bank' comes from banco, or bench, after benche~ used by moneylenders in Italian cities such as Florence, Genoa, Venice and Milan. Wherever Archon hybrids went, control of money went with them. Central to this for centuries has been the Archon-Reptilian House of Rothschild and it was they"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"250 Figure 446: 'Satanism, senet societies. politic5. banking and media are all linl-ed hy the Archontic Web. who globally established the fiat 'money' con-trick. Ask most people, even most System people, how money is created a~d they will either look at you bewildered - or 'gone out' a~ my mother used to say - or they will parrot some nonsense about 'the government'. In fact, the overwhelming majority of money (credit) comes into circulati.on by priv a te banks (all ultimately owned by the same Archon hybrid famrnes) making 'loans '. This gives them almost total power over how much 'money' is in circulati.on (boom) and how much is not (recession or depression). You may notice that I am putting a lot of words within quote marks and I do this to indicate that the word doesn't really mean what we are told that it means. A loan indicates that something has been given, but in terms of a 'loan' of 'money' it hasn't, except in theory. ['IJ explain ... Money out of noth ing When you apply to a bank for a 'loan' what happens? First they demand that you secure the 'loan' by signing oveI to them intrinsic wealth - house, land and such like. Then they type into your account the figure they have agreed to 'give' you in return for it all being paid back- plus interest. What have they really 'Loaned' you? Fresh air. Worthle ss fiat currency works in league with fractional reserve lending which allows banks to lend nine or ten times (far, far more in truth) what they have on deposit , and so every ti.me you put a pound or dollar in a bank you are giving it the legal right to 'lend' nine or ten that it doesn't have in the form of non-existent 'credit'. Fiat money 'credit' is 'money' that does not and will never exist except in theory (Fig 447). The £100,000 you may ha ve 'borrowed' to buy a house is only six digits and a£ sign that someone has added to your account, and this is only stage one in the money-go-round. You transfer this 'money' (credit) to the owner of the house you are buying and he or she accepts it only because they believe it is worth what they are told it is. They, in tum, transfer it to the owner of their next house and the same thing happens. Fractional res erve landing goes even further into the realms of insanity. Say you borrow credit to buy a car and hand this over to the owner who puts it in hi s Figure 447: B,1nking is leg;ilised then. bank.

Honey of nothing by the first bank, but now the sec ond bank can lend nine or ten times its alleged worth again to other people under fractional re s erve lending and the sa me with any subsequent banks where mo ney from the original fresh-air loan of credit ends up. Consider the ex traordinary amount of theoretical money or credit that the banking system can generate (and 'lend' again) from a s ingle Joan (Fig 448). The Archon hybrid 'on e-percent' or less-than-one-per-cent ha s hijacked the global economy and human society by swapping non-existent credit for wealth of intrinsic value - land, property, resources. There are ways that a th eo retical currency can be used as a srmbolic means of exchange to overcome the limitations of barter, but that can't happen while there is the addition of interest. Once interest is charged the i,ery u ni / ~f.fi11a11cial excliange is 'created'from t ire s tart as a debt. Interest on fresh air credit changes the game completely. You c an also rob people of their real wealth by increasing interest to the point where th ey can no longer pay you back and by 251 Figure 448: Put it in another bank ,mrl they can lend it again. Figure 449: This is exactl y the situation whl•n people are toreclosed. cra shing the financial system which has the same effect. Once they can't repay your non-existent credit and interest you move in to take the loot and they are often on the street (Fig 449). To those who are nev,, to this it may seem inexplicable that governments hould pass laws that allow private banks (owned by the same Archontic cabal) to dominate the creation of 'money' and be able to 'lend' many times what they actually ha ve on deposit (and even that is only in theory). Why do government.'> borrow money al interest from private banks (which the taxpayer has to repay) when they could issue th eir own currency interest free? These are all legitimate points and questions, but they ha ve a single answer: Governments are controlled by the same Archon hybrids that own and control the banks. By dictating how much 'money' is in circulation (by how much the y decide to loan) the banks are dictating how much economk activity is possible. Recessions and depressions don't happen because people decide they don't want to work, have a home or feed their families. They happen when there is not enough money in circulation or of sufficient perceived value to generate the income required to pay for tho se things. Who controls that? The ba11ks. Who owns them? The Arcl1011 blood/i11es. This following sequence is known by economists (most of them clueless about money- creation) as 'the economic cycle' when it is pure manipulation: Stage 1: You put lots of money ind rculation by making lots of loans at low but"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"252 variable interest rates. In doing so, you stimulate lots of economic activity- a boom. Stage 2: People and businesses tend to get into more debt during boom times with confidence in their income leading to new plant, machinery, property and other investments to meet expanding demand or reflecting an improved economic statw,. Stage 3: At the optimum time to trawl the wealth of the people you start taking money out of circulation by either raising interest rates and calling in lo,ms or crashing the system as in 2008 to cause what they called the 'credit crunch'. Stage 4: You grab the loot in property, land, resources and business from those who can no longer afford to pay you back the 'money' which under any bane criteria you didn't actually give them. Unrepayable debt is coldly encoded in the banking system. A loan of £100,000 that a bank theoretically brings into circulation leads to £100,000 of credit being transferred into your account; but you are not committed to paying back only £100,000. You are repaying this figure plus interest and the i11terest is nei,er created with any 'loan'. Take a breath before considering what this means: There is never even nearly enough ' mone y' in circulation at any time to pay all the outstanding 'loans', plus interest, and people losing their intrinsic wealth to the banks is built into the system. Thi& simple fact can be hidden to an extent during a boom on the principle of Peter paying Paul but during a recession or depression it is perfectly obvious from lost homes, businesses and ruined lives. The debt trap is being played on countries as well as individual s with governments (taxpayers) drowning in debt to banks and other creditors. Official American government debt is approaching $20 trillion but the real figure with everything added in is more like Jiu11dreds of trillions. Laurence Kotikoff, economics professor at Boston University, suggested a figure of $220 trillion some years ago. Cumulative individual debt of Americans is estimated to be $11.85 trillion by 2015 figures with student 'loans' (paying for your own programming) at nearly $1.19 trillion . Debt= control = slavery, just as scarcity= dependency = control. The equation the Archons and their bloodlines want to avoid at all costs is abundance= choice= freedom. We have become used to seeing European and global entities such as the European Central Bank (ECB), International Monetary Fw1d (IMF) and World Bank moving in to 'bail out' countries like Greece, Ireland and others. 'Bail out' is code for imposing massive interest-bearing debt, transferring wealth from people to bankers, and vicious austerity on entire populations, which they subsequently control by dictating to governments who dictate to the people. These global and European banking entities were created by guess who?

What a gigantic confidence trick - and it controls the world today more than ever. We are told 'there isn't enough money' for the poor to be supported, the hungry fed or the homeless given shelter, but funding for war is never a problem. When was the last time you heard a political leader say they can't go to war because the country can't afford it? Americans are living in tents or on the street while the country spends trillions bombing faraway lands {Fig 452). The United States is responsible for 41 percent of the world's military spending and 31 percent of armaments sold or given to other countries. Some 85-90 percent on average of those killed in wars in which those weapons are used are civilians. America has been at war in 222 of 240 years since 1776. Special Operations Command spokesman Ken McGraw said in 2015 that American Special Forces had been deployed in 147 countries - 75 percent of the world's recognised nations - and at any one time they are active in 80 to 90. The $-100 billio11 spent on developing a new fighter jet (with $400,000 each for pilot 'helmets') could have given every homeless person in America a nice place to live (Fig 453). Instead the homeless population of New York a.lone soars past 60,000 - 40 percent of them children. This is not incompetence, but calculation (Fig 454).

People switch off when it come s to financial issues with all the jargon , gobbledegook, wind and air abo ut hedge funds, bulls , bears, naked shorts, put options, peak rate, non-plan expe nditure and all the rest which most of tho se involved don't even understand. A financial reporter wrote: I have been interviewing bankers and asset mana gers ior the best part of two decades and, Lord knows, they can be hard to understand. Many is the time I have looked up from my not epad to realise that I haven 't understood a word that the interviewee has uttered for the last few minutes. Or rather, I understood the individual words, but not in the context the banker was using them. At its core, however, the financial system is simple: you lend people money that doesn't exist (credit) and charge them interest on it; you don't create the interest (as currency) and so there is always far more debt than 'money ' in existence to pay it back; when people can't repay, especially when you purposely crash the syste m, you steal their wealth and their possessions that do exist - their homes, land , businesses and cars. The latest figures I saw confirmed that we are approaching the point where one percent of the global population own 50 percent of the world's wealth in all its forms. They have achieved thi s largely by exchanging fresh air ' money ' for land, property , resources and corporate entities. An Archontic one percent (less in fact) is stealing the world and 50 percent is not nearly enough for them - they want the lot (Fig 456) .

This happens all the time, and major financial players like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers always end up richer in the wake of banking and financial collapses. Witness what happened after the crash of 2008 . Engineered financial crises transfer ever more wealth from the people to the less than one percent and I will be dealing with th e plan11ed consequences of that later on . People ask why banks and stock market s would be crashed when many in the financial industry lose their jobs and money, but at their level they are only pawns in the game like everyone else. If you are not in the less than one percent you are just another expendable no matter how rich and powerful you ma y currently think you are. Jf you own the World Cup it doe s n't really matt er which team s win and lose because you always win when you own the game itself. This is the relationship of the global financial system to Archon hybrids and their hidden master s. Finance and politics are the two major dictators and arbiters of choice in the daily lives of almost everyone with regard to th e laws, rules and regulations which limit action, potential and availability of money to allow or deny choice. When you break it all down, there is ultimately no real choice and that mean s slavery. Oh, people will sa y, I could choose to be a lawyer, doctor, politician, CEO, the choices are endless; but those are The System's choices, not necessarily yours, and they there to s erve its intere sts. You have only chosen one of those choices on offer once again. Even then you need money to pursue those choice s (jobs) and how many are reall y your choices and how many merely the result of pres s ure and influence from parents and academics who tell you what your 'choice' should be? Try choosing something outside The System without acces s to money and s ee what happens. Financial slavery is founded on making the basic s of life - food, drink, shelter, warmth- available only in return for money, when they should a human right in any civilised and conscious society. The more you need to s erve The System to earn the money to survive the mor e control The System has over you. AU over the world humanity wakes up each morning to a new day of work and toil which is not done as a choice but as a necessity of s urvival (Fig -157). What better definition could there be for slavery? When you and your family need money for the basics of life and The System is the only ource of money to pay for them what choice do you have but to s erve The System and allow it to be your master? This is the idea, and why today's financial and corporate system has been created. Once the essentials of life are provided by a society that genuinely believes in \\ freedom, people can choose to accept that lifestyle and do things that don't have to generate more income or alternatively choose to do something else that would. This would be their choice, not The Figure 457: A n ew day in the slave camp."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"We 're Free. Honey 257 System's choice and the Archons' choice. Where would the money come from to provide for the essential needs of everyone as a matter of course? I'll answer that with another question: where does it come from 11ow? Where do the open cheques come from fo r endless war and carnage? 'Money' is a theoretical means of energetic exchange and it can be used for slavery and dependency or for freedom and prosperity. lt is just a c li oice. The program dictating the perceptions of Phantom Self is so ingrained and omnipotent in mo~t people that they won't be able to grasp that simple fact. They will co ntinue to demand 'Where will the money come from?' Are we really saying that humans are less powerful than non-existent money called credit? Are we saying that it should control us and not we it? So it would seem, but that's Phantom Self for you. Who owns your body? Surely the most basic of freedoms would be an unchallengeable right to decide what we allow in our own bodies and the right to decide how we are treated when we are ill. How can freedom possibly exist when people are forcibly medicated and denied the tre atment they choose to have when alternative practitioners with records of success are banned and jailed? This has to be a foundation definition of fascism, but this is h appening and it's still nowhere near as extreme as it is planned to be .

A UK Freedom of Information request revealed that more than a thousand pa ti e nts had starved to death in hospital in four years and four times that number had 'de hydration' on their death certificates. Patients leaving Briti sh hospitals suffering from malnutrition had doubled to 5,558 while 'Health' Secretary Jeremy Hunt s aid in 2015 that a 'plane crash' number of patients were dying avoidably in UK hospitals at the rate of about 200 a week. A Save the Children report in 2013 said the United States with its Big Pharma-controlled 'medical' system had the highest first-day death rate for babies in the industrialised world. This daily deva s tation of human health unfolds , with gove rnment support, while the same authorities are vociferously targeting alternative or com plementary practitioners who, while there are many clueless people among their ranks , could not begin to compete with such catastrophic levels of human carnage. How can Big Pharma medicine be anything but a fast-track to the cemetery when it is based on a complete misunderstanding of what the body is and how it functions? I say mis understanding and that's true of the rank and file, but once again the inner core drivi ng the Big Pharma Archon agenda do know the nature of the body and therefore the c onsequences, short-term and long, of what they are doing. Everything is an energe tic information field and when a distorted or disharmonious field comes into conta ct with human fields this distortion and disharmony can be passed on. We see drugs and vaccines in their holographic form, but in their base state they are distorted infom 1ation fields that distort human fields. The di s tortion can be so extreme that the perso n dies either immediately or cumulatively. These distortions that impact on health are called 'side-effects', but there is nothing 'side' about them. They are effects every bit as much as the alleged positive effect that the drug is claimed to have. Alternative trea tmenb are founded on harmonising human energy fields while Big Pharma medicine devastates them. Whatever is happening in the information fields - harmony or disharmony - is happening in the hologram in the form of health or dis-ease.

Schmitz and Ter Meer were jailed for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials but Ter Meer only served fouI of his seven -year sentence after the intervention of his friend and four-times Governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller. Ter Meer then continued his career with Bayer and eventuaJly headed Codex Alimentarius to use the excuse of 'harmonising' global food and supplement laws and regulations to target alternatives to Big Pharma (Fig 463}. Codex Alimentarius is recognised by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-created World Trade Organization, which provides powers of enforcement to Codex laws and regulations. The Rockefeller family, subordinates in the bloodline hierarchy to the Rothschilds, are largely responsible for giving the world today ' s govemment- imposed killing field 'allopathic medicine'. Oil and pharmaceutical tycoon John D. Rockefeller was behind the establishme nt of the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1847 and conspired to impose Big Pharma medicine on the world. Today the AMA has one of the biggest political lobbying budgets in the United States. RockefelJer set out to take over medical s choob and introduce a system of medical licencing . This meant that physicians could not be physicians without a licence and they couldn't get a licence unless they treated patients the way The System demanded. Licensing alone gave Rockefeller Big Pharma co ntrol over methods of treatment and the mean s to banish the now so-called ' alternatives' that were used before. Licenced doctors who challenge orthodoxy in any way are jumped upon with a vengeance. The licensing scam is employed thrnughout The System to ensure that people do things The System's way or not at ail. Alternative or complimentary treatment is now a target for this. John D. Rockefeller imposed Big Pharma medicine while being treated by his personal homeopath who was still at his bedside when he died at the age of 97. Notice how many bloodline stalwarts live to a great age compared with the general population. Thi s relates to their genetics and to the fact that they don't have the same treatment they force on the ma ss e s. Rockefeller founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (America's first) in 1901 to promote Big Pharma medicine and this is known today as Rockefeller University. I will fe ature later an American doctor and Rockefeller insider who made a series of predictions nearly 50 years ago from knowledge of the Archon agenda which have e ither happened or are happening.

Richard Da y told the Pittsburgh meeting that the plan was to cull the population through medicine, food, new laboratory-made diseases and suppression of a cure for cancer. 'You may as well die of cancer as something else', this cold, callous Archontic man said. Anyone think that this mentality behind Big Pharma medicine has any desire to see humanity healthy in mind and body? I see genuine people rattling their tins for cancer research but I will not contribute from the knowledge that the cure is already known but suppressed - another reason why many bloodline assets live for so long. Is it really credible that mind-blowing amounts of money have been donated to 'cancer research' worldwide and yet cancer numbers continue to soar? Or that the two main treatments ,ue radi,1tion and chemotherapy, both of which devastate the immune system and open people to more disease including cancer? Chemotherapy is liquid poison or weed killer as one doctor put it (Fig 464). Americans ,, vere taking on average twelve medications a year by 2011 with the number growing year on year.

Only 12 percent of 2,500 of the most common drugs and treatments prescribed by doctors have been confirmed in proper scientific studies as having any effect in treating illness.

E nding vaccine cho i ce Po litical and medical fascism is adding a new element to it~ tyranny with increasing pressure and laws to impose compulsory vaccination. This has begun with the To t,1Litarian Tiptoe of banning adults from healthcare jobs and children from school and daycare without government (Big Pharma) 'recommended' vaccinations. You will see Lhis expanded to other locations, too. The claim is that the unvaccinated put the va ccinated at risk, but there are two questions here: What happened to the alleged immunity of the vaccinated and how come outbreaks affect the vaccinated while unvaccinated go unaffected? Oh, and another question: lf vacdnation is safe why are va st amounts of money paid out to vaccine-damaged people? Mandatory vaccinations means mandatory devastation of health and even death for many (Fig 466). California governor Jerry Brown signed a bill in 2015 eliminating vaccine exemptions for personal and religious beliefs. Only a certified medirnl reason can avoid vaccination for those in public and private schools and daycare centres (Fig 467). The bill followed a campaign le d by California Democratic (joke} senator and paediatrician Richard Pan who is re ported to have received $95,000 from Big Pharma during the legislative session of 20 13-2014.

They ad vised to forget facts and deal in emotion: 'Reason leads to conclusions, while emotion leads to action.' All that really mattered was the power of the story and people cared about benefits not facts, the advice continued. Remember that next time anyone fancies a Coke, Pepsi or Big Mac. Selling vaccines in the same way as selling Coca Cola or a burger and fries just about sums it up. Health consequences of mass vaccination are catastrophic but to Big Pharma they are only another fact-free brand to sell. Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates is another major corporate promotor of worldwide vaccination and he turns up constantly in projects on the A rchontic wishlist (Fig 469). Still-de\\'eloping immune systems are deluged with toxins by the insane 25 to 30 (,md growing) vaccinations before the age of two, and even more between then and six-years old, and into teenage years (Fig -170). Their immune system will never be the same again after being devastated by a constant wave of poison, and here we have still another inversion when vaccines are supposed to boost immunity. A damaged and weakened immune system leaves people open to health consequences that would normally be dealt with by the body, and this will become even more significant later in the book.

They are slaves to the programmed software of Phantom Self. Observe the animal world and the cycles of software behaviour which doesn't chang e generation after generation. This is especially ~o with software extreme s such as crocodiles and other reptiles. I saw two demonstrationf.. at crocodile farm~ in Au s trali a in which the keeper showed how the crocs' behaviour is ba-.ed on impulses that they 268"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"269 can't override or resist. The keeper would say that if he did this, the croc would do that, and it happened every time. Great tracts of the human race are the same and Archon- Reptilians certainly are. It's not a case of being either Phantom Self or Infinite Awareness. I said that only those with some connection to beyond-the-Matrix awareness can make genuine choices and free decisions. There is a huge spectrum of perception from fully-blown Phantom Self to those with expanded awareness hardly affected by the program. These different states can be observed through behaviour and on that basis many who think they are 'awake' are actuaJly Phantom Self held fast in the program through the self-delusion that they're not. Those influenced by Infinite Awareness have an instinctive empathy that override:, the response of what's in it for me, me, me. I mean empathy expressed in actions and not only words, which have constant potential for deception. I mean those that walk thefr talk, but few do. Phantom Self has them under lock and key. Infinite Awareness can also be seen in c1n openness of mind in those who respond with their own intuition or knowing, and not only to the alleged facts and figures of academia and song sheet science. Such people are not immune from Phantom Self programs and they can play them out, but they also have moments, sometimes far more than moments, when they transcend them. These are the people that the Archons are still after in their quest for a closed world in which only Phantom Self exists and humans are devoid of any awareness outside the sofhvare. To know this is to grasp a \\\"ery different understanding of global society and why it is taking the direction that it is. My approach to research has always been to establish the goal and the methods employed to reach the goal. Without this knowledge everything appears unconnected and a series of events that have no apparent consistency or connection. Once you know where the plan wants to take the world and the methods of manipulation used to take u, there then events that seem random and disconnected come into clearly-connected clarity. Ahhlt, so /Ital's why they're doing this or that. The plan for human subjugation has been followed long term with Archons in hybrid bloodlines coming in and out of th_b reality through cycles of birth and death to advance the agenda through its different phases un the road to total control. They may be called different names by history but they are the same Archoru. coming, going and returning. It's not quite that simple because there it> no time, only the illusion of it, and Archontic manipulation in what we perceive to be 'past' and 'future' can influence events in what we experience as the ' present'. This concept has been explored and portrayed in several movies. \\1anipulating the past is like changing a scene in a DVD that makes all the scenes that follow also change to sync with it and, in the other direction, to change the final scene which makes the scenes up to that point change to lead to the new outcome. You can't manipulate the 'present' from the perceived 'pc1st' and 'future'? Of course you can - it's all a program happening in the infinite NOW. Only the sequence is being changed by manipulating the NOW in a way that appears to flow from past through present to future. There is no such thing as time travel only NOW travel that is experienced as time tra\\'el. I have explained the two key methods of mass manipulation - Problem-Reaction- Solution and the Totalitarian Tiptoe - and now [ am going to describe the world that the.,e and other perception deceptions are in the proces~ of creating. 1 refer to this as the Hunger Games Society because the power structure that Archons and their hybrids want to impose is portrayed (but only to an extent) in the Hunger Games movie series."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"170 Pha111om St ~ We .ue well on the way to th at end if people \\Vill only lift their eyes from the smartphone and look around .

What they have done to Greece and other countries is what they plan to do to the world - and far, far worse. A major scam to remove financial independence from even those currently wealthy is known as the 'bail-in'. The term came to public consciousness with the manipulated banking crisis in Cyprus in 2013 (Problem-Reaction-Solution). Crashing banks is a doddJe when the financial system is controlled by 271 Fig u re 477: When you put money in a bank it becomes their propt>ny in effect - not your.;. Archontic families like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers . Banking crises were dealt with before Cyprus by governments bailing out banks through borrowing (often from banks) and taxation. This was bad enough, but now it got a whole lot worse. Cyprus banks were 'saved' by taking money directly from accounts of depositors - the 'bail-in' - and this common theft was demanded by the so-called 'Troika' of the Rothschild-controlled European Central Bank (ECB), Rothschild-controlled IMF and Rothschild-controlled European Commission with the enthusiastic support of Rothschild-controUed Germany in the form of Rothschild-controlled Chancellor Merkel. This criminal syndicate, sorry, 'Troika', came together to crush Greece, and the plan is for this Archontic hit-squad to do the same to the entire European Union as a blueprint for the world. At the time of the Cyprus bail-in the EU guaranteed deposits up to 100,000 euros (£85,000), but everything above that was simply stolen to the tune of some 60 to 80 percent oi what was in the private accounts . A lot of rich people were not nearly so rich after this bank heist and I cannot emphasise enough that those who have wealth now and think they are immune from poverty and deprivation should think again. If they are not part of this £/-lite then their wealth is going to be targeted, too. Already a large number of formerly 'middle class' or 'upper middle class' people a re living on the street. The European Union announced in 2015 that the deposit guarantee for British savers would be cut from £85,000 to £75,000 and the idea is to remove all bank deposit protection across Europe. The plan is to crash the banking and financial system on a scale that will make 2008 look very smalJ deal. With the bail-in principle now accepted and in place they intend to steal people's money on a mass scale with pension funds also in their gunsights. When you deposit money in a bank you are only an unsecured creditor if the bank goes down, which any of them could at almost any time (Fig 477). Financial reform advocate Ellen Brown said of the new bail-in rules: They use words so that it's not obvious to tell what they have done, but what they did was say, basically, that we, the governments, are no longer going to be responsible for bailing out the big banks. There are about 30 (systemically important) international banks. So, you are going to have to save yourselves, and the way you are going to have to do it is by bailing in the mone y oi your creditors. The largest class of creditors of any bank is the depositors."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"272 Fig u re 478: The derivative market is a ticking time bomb for the global financial system.

This truth is hidden behind financial complexity and gobbledegook terms such as 'forwards', 'futures', 'options', 'swaps', 'synthetic collateralised debt obligations' and 'credit default swaps'. When the derivatives illusion is unmasked - and this is what is planned - the global financial system goes with it (Fig 478). Four banks, J.P.

Hunger Games hierarchy I have been exposing the political and enforcement structure of the Hunger Games Society for two decades and the pieces arc being constantly moved into place by the Totalitarian Tiptoe.

Now we have nations be .ing absorbed by superstates like the European Union, with many others planned to emerge from stalking horse 'free-trade .ueas' in the same way the EU has been. 'Globalisation' is the Archontic agenda on public display but without the essential background for people to see that - until now. For the few to secure ever-increasing control over the many they have to incessantly centralise decision-making; the more you centralise power the more power you have to centralise even quicker. World government is planned to oversee a second tier of EU-style superstates in the Americas, Africa, Middle East, Asia/ Australia/New Zealand and so on . None of these or the world government would be elected, and we have thi s already in the European Union which is controlled by appointed bureaucratic dark suits in Brussels and not elected politicians (except in theory).

Paying with a credit card takes only seconds but we are being urged to pay through the new contactless system 'because it's quicker' when the real reason is to secu re another stepping stone to a fully cashless and microchipped society. Further en gineered economic problems give Archon hybrids more excuses to replace cash. Some co untries are virtually cashless already and even Iran is trialling a cashless system. Fighting for tyranny A world army would impose the will of the self-appointed world government on an y country or community that refused to play ball. T have once again warned for decades that NATO was a TotaUtarian Tiptoe to a world army and so it is proving. The United States military is als o a proxy world army in conjunction with Britain ,md other NATO countries, and a time is planned when command of all of them will be given to a world authority. We can see this emerging with the US military structure that has carved the world into 'COMS' or commands (Fig 48 6). There is a CENTCOM, AFRlCOM , EUC OM, PACOM, SOUTHCOM and NO RTH COM and American troops are Figure -'86: The glob.ii comma nd structure oi the Americ,rn military is really being creatt>d ior the planned world army."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"276 deployed in some form in more than 150 countries. This structure is not actually for the American military ultimately but is being prepared to hand over to the world army.

They decide that a country or regime is not obeying orders and in goes the American military with or without Britain and NATO to get rid of them.

Such 'regime change' is not alway done directly and often involves US/NATO trained , armed and funded' rebels'. This happened with the engineered' Arab Spring', which has led to death, destruction and sufferi n g throughout the Middle East. Regime- changing too many times by direct invasion will be too obvious. Better to manipulate the population to do it for you. I have detailed the background to the Arab Spring hoa:1. and those behind it in other books. This includes Obama's appointment of Robert S. Ford as United States Ambassador to Syria in the period before 'rebels' began an uprising using US-supplied weapons, and they were later joined by other US- instigated 'rebels' who had removed and killed Gaddhafi in Libya. Ford had served in Iraq after the invasion under Ambassador John Negroponte who orchestrated death squads in Central America on behalf of the Reagan-Father Bush administration during a civil wa r that cost the lives of 75,000 men, women and children in El Salvador. Ford ran the sam e death squad deal in lraq - under Negroponte as Minister Counsellor for Political Affai rs - and then repeated the now-dubbed 'Salvador option' after being named Ambassador to Syria (Fig 488). Professor Michel Chossudovsky from the Global Research website said: Since his arrival in Damascus in late January 2011 until he was recalled by Washington in October 2011, Ambassador Robert S. Ford played a central role in laying the groundwork within Syria as well as establishing contacts with opposition groups ... Ford also played a role in the recruitment of Mujahideen mercenaries from neighbouring Arab countries and their integration into Syrian 'opJX>Sition iorces'. Since his departure from Damascus, Ford continues to oversee the Syria project out of the US State Department. Ford was recalled from Syria because of 'credible threats' to hi~ safety when state television began to expose his involvement in the formation of death squads.

American presidents now have the power to kill anyone including their own citizens without charge, evidence or trial once they appear on a ClA 'kill list'. Trus is mostly done through drone attacks (Fig 489). British Prime Minfater David Cameron announced in 2015 that he had sanctioned death by drone in Syria without producing any evidence in support of his claims that the targets were planning terrorism in the UK (Fig 490). It's do what you like time and these are the mass-murdering terrorists who claim to be protecting us from terrorism. Another pre-determined bonus for Archon hybrids of this systematic violence and upheaval is for dispossessed ma sses and refugees to head for Europe to escape war and tyranny and bring more chaos and upheaval by their sheer numbers. Chaos, like fear, is the currency of control. What I call Probl~m-Reaction-Solution is the Freemasonic motto 'Order Ab Chao', or order out of chaos (Fig 491 }. Create chaos and you create the excuse to impose order - your order - as an alleged solution to the chaos. Harmony is almost impossible to manipulate by trying Figure 491: Freemasoni c Problem- Reactron-Solution. to justify change in a si tuation where everything is fine. Chaos makes people open to anything they beUeve will end the chaos.

Here you have the reason for private policing and security companies such as G4S securing government contracts no matter what their performance. Volunteer police officers or Community Support Officers in Britain are being given ever more powers from the professional police as part of the dismantling of policing as we have known it until now. Private prisons are negotiating contracts in which governments agree to ensure high occupancy rates (Fig 495). Better have more laws then, eh? How about a ban on breathing? This new police/policed dynamic was captured in Australia when a police officer on the Gold Coast was charged with 'misconduct in public office' for leaking a video to the media exposing how his colleagues brutally beat a 21-year-old while the blood was washed away by a senior sergeant. The officers who did this were not charged, only the one who exposed what they did. Do what you like lads, just don't tell anyone. Doing it is fine, just don't get caught. Psychopaths and sofhvare minds are also being recruited into government administration at every level and they and law enforcement personnel are sent on 'training courses' which are nothing more than mind control operations to further integrate the program and instil a sense of us and them with the public.

FBI Director James Corney said ludicrously that public outrage over police brutality videos might have caused an increase in violent crime -what, by the police? He produced no evidence, of course, because he's an idiot. Police beat, shoot, kill and Taser with virtual impunity in terms of official consequences for their actions. I provide a long list of them in TJze Perception Deception and where but in a psychopathic police state would you find headlines like '14 San Francisco cops gang up on homeles s man with one leg and 'armed ' with crutches ' ? Put those words into a search engine and you'll see the video of morons in uniform . How much more extreme and psychopathically outrageous can you get than British polke officers holding down an innocent Brazilian electrician, Jean Charles de Menezes, on a London tube train while another officer shot him in the head at point-blank range S<-'Vell times? They said they mistook him for a 'terrori st' when he was just a young guy going about his day. lf anyone else had done what those officers did it would be considered cold-blooded murder and a long prison sentence would follow, but the officer who fired the gun was promoted and so was the police commander overseeing the operation, Cressida Dick. She was also made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for 'se rvices to policing' and now works for the British Foreign Office. l know that most people are bewildered when they see poUce brutality and murder around the world, especially in the United States, and officers involved facing no consequences. Once you know what is going on and where it i!. planned to lt:>ad the mystery dissolves. Police officers are not disciplined, fired or jailed because they are literally doing their job. Oh, no, this is not official vet, but it is the underl ying, unspoken theme (Fig 498). The idea is to make the public so terrified of police and other forms of law enforcement that they become subservient, acquiescent and unquestioning. It's alieady happening. Tasers with their 55,000 volts of electricity are all part of this. Th ey said at first that Tasers would only be used by trained fireanns officers when lives were threatened but I wrote at the time that this was only the start of a Totalitarian Tiptoe to widespread and indiscriminate use. This is exactly what has happened.

Death by Taser adds enormously to fear and acquiescence. Tasers are being used ever more frequently on children by these lunatics (Fig 499). Put these words into a search engine to s ee how far it's already gone : 'Shocking Video Shows How a Schoolyard Quarrel is Dealt With ln a Police State.' Notice how police increasingly look (and behave) like the military. The aim is to hm no distinction between th e two and to fuse them into a global military enforcement structure with a central command operating at every level of society down into every local community (Fig 500). New York Mayor Bill de Blasio declared his intent for the city's law enforcement to join the United Nations and the US Department of Justice in combatting 'all forms of violent extremism, whether it's based in religious, or racial, or nationalistic or ideological intolerance'. But not if it's the work of the New York police, presumably. New York is also participating in 'The Strong Cities Network' to 'counter a range of domestic and global terror threats'. Usual cover story. The Strong Cities Network is another vehicle for coordination on the way to a global police / military for ce as cities 'integrate' efforts to ' afeguard citizens' by deleting their freedom . It is being nm by the lnstitute for Strategic Dialogue (TSO) established by British-ba s ed Zionist George Weidenteld (Baron Weidenfeld) to ' counter extremism,' among other things. Your definition of ' extremism', pray? Then we have the 1033 program in the United State s through which the Pentagon has been transferring military hardware and weapons worth billions of doUars to local police and SWAT teams (psychopaths mostl y) for nothing or next to nothing. Half a billion dollar s' worth was transferred in 2014 alone and it's been increasing every year. Hi-tech weaponry handed to county police forces has induded grenade lmmclzers, M-16 a:;sault rifles, armo11rcd veliicle s and tanks, lielicoptcrs a11d military robots. Why do local police forces need grenade launchers and tanks? They don't to do the job they are officiaUy supposed to do, but that is only for public consumption and perception deception (Fig 501). People we re so shocked by the military veh icles and equipment used so publicly during the Ferguson riot s in Missou ri in 2014 and 2015 that police have been ordered to hand back so me of the more extrem e military vehicles and weaponry, but many police forces are kicking and screaming and this story is not over yet long term.

Giving grenade launchers, armoured vehicles and tanks to local police forces may s eem crazy, but less so when you realise that the control structure is planned to be from the bottom-up as well as top- down. Law enforcement and government administration is being prepared for the fascist control of local communities to prevent any challenge to the power struc ture gathering momentum. Many wiJI have noticed how authoritarian local councils and state and county government are becoming and how ever-more government agencies operate with armed enforcement units in the United States. These include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and even the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), among a list of others (Fig 503). At the time of writing there are calls for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to follow suit on its way to being America's version of the East German state security or Stasi. All these ,1gencies and so many more are merging with the police and military into a global enforcement network to impose the will of the Archon El-lite. Fascist police states are founded on almost everything being iJlegal and we are having a tidal wave of new laws and regulations dictating every facet of life cascading from governments and parliaments of the world in the last few decades. Federal judges in Texas even ruled that having pro- police bumper stickers, air fresheners and religious symbols in a vehicle can be considered 'reasonable suspicion of criminal activity' and ju s tify a police traffic stop. Authorities in Ferguson, Missouri, have targeted black people in particular with ... wait for it ... 'pants sagging laws' and 'manner of walking violations'. A British comedy show years ago did a sketch about a racist police officer who was arresting black people for walking on the cracks in the pavement and wearing loud shiits. We have reached a stage of madness where Figu re 503: 'Hey. thar hedge is too high .' even comedic exaggeration is no longer"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"284 necessary or possible. During the nine-year British premiership of big-time Archon front man, psychopath and war criminal Tony Blair, 3,000 new criminaJ offences were created - almost one per day. We also have the ever more mountainous scale of ' international law', regulations and treaties. International laws that everyone on the planet is supposed to obey are essential to a world government dictatorship (Fig 504). At the sa me time protection and detection of crimes against the public cue being constantly reduced to remove 'psychological and physicaJ security' and u se crime 'to manage society' in the words of a bloodline insider I will highlight in the next chapter. When law enforce ment is perceived to be ineffective, people will be open to the police being run by private Archontic corporations and involvement from the military - Problem-Reaction-Solution. The s ame scam is being played out to hand Britain's health service to private corporations. We have had the most bizarre policies announced by British police forces that include not investigating burglaries at odd-numbered Figure 504: The Spider 1s producing an explosion of laws, tdxes and financial demdn ds to anach peopl e to its web . houses (I kid you not ) and stopping all investigation of 'criminal damage, minor assaults and lower-value thefts.' One police chief suggested that people who have been burgled should email the evidence to the police to save them coming round, other~ ha ve been asked to use Skype and we have had police officers going to crime scenes by bus because there are not enough cars (Fig 505). Reducing funding to police makes it eas y to force them into cutting the scale and breadth of operation, which leads to privatisation - the plan from the start. No place to hide Engineered terrorist attacks, systematically-promoted fear of terrorist attacks, and fury generated among those whose countries are devastated by Archontic psychopaths all provide calculated excuses to take away basic freedoms to 'protect the public from terrorists' and advance the police state. Thi.s is happening on a mega and quickening scale as new technologies are constantly introduced to face-scan, eye- scan, finger-scan, everything-scan, and record every communication through Figure 505 : The System wants crime to frighten rx.,opl e into accepting more laws .-ind deletions of freedom a nd this is why so much is being i~noreo and uninvestigat ed .

Re velations about the extraordinary sur ve illance reach and capabilities of the Unit ed States National Security Agency (NSA ) don't even begin to tell the story of the scale of surveillance to which the population is now subjected with so much more to come (Fig 511 ). Britain's GCHQ surveillance operation is just the same or worse (Fig 512). American Edward Snowden , who worked for a co mpany contracted to th e NSA , went pub li c in 2013 to reveal the astonishing sca le (to most people) of surveillance on th e public by these agencies. He fled to Ru ss ia and wa s charged by the Obama a dministration under the Espionage Act which had only been used to prosecute gove rnment-connected officials three tim es since 1917 before Obama began to use it as a tool for punishing and s il encing those who sought to expose wha t they know about government and i nt elligence corruption and the scale alr ea dy of the Big Brother State.

This doesn't mean that everyone is watched every day in what they call 'real time' - though targeted people will be - but they can access any information they want about your movements, statements and activities whenever they like. Snowden revealed that the authorities can switch on your smartphone at a distance and turn on the microphone even when the phone is turned off. This may sound Figure 514: Chips with evel)1hing. outrageous, but what they are planning is far more extreme as I will be explaining. We have traffic cameras recording numberplates that can also be read from satellite. Smart meters in homes and businesses using wireless technology can tell the authorities how many people you have in your home and what rooms they're in - even when you open the fridge. We even have gaming technology like the X-box able to hear conversation..,; and see through clothing. Microchipped people - which I have constantly warned about in the last quarter of a century - are now a reality. The plan is to extend this to everyone by first selling microchips as 'cool', then making it ever more difficult to function and deal with money without one and finally making them compulsory (Fig 514). I'll be expanding on the significance of human microchipping. 'Pre-crime' technology is being used to assess body language and emotions so people can be arrested for doing something they've not yet done and never intended to. Does anyone really believe that this colossal scale of surveillance and control is being done to 'protect the public from terrorism'?? Consider this: how many people actually die from terrorism (espedally non-engineered terrorism) compared with road accidents, cancer, heart attacks, 'treatment' by mainstream medicine and accidents in the home? The number killed by terrorism, even including the terrorism carried out by government agencies and blamed on others, is ti11y by comparison. American civilians who died worldwide in terrorist attacks in 2010: Eight. At least 29 died in the same period from being struck by lightning. Heart disease and cancer kill 1.5 million in America each year and one study I saw suggested that research into cancer runs at some $10,000 per American victim while spending to 'combat terrorism' (delete freedom) equates to $500 million per American victim. I am not saying that lives lost to governments and other terrorists don't matter , but clearly the unlimited money assigned worldwide every year to 'fighting terrorism ' is not about terrorism at all.

The report, made public through the Freedom of Information Act warned of 'dire consequences' from allowing (US- created) Al-Qaeda to unify the jihadist Sunni Muslim forces in Iraq, Syria and the rest of the Arab world against all other Muslim minorities. It said: 'ISi (the Islamic State of Iraq) could also declare an Islamic State through its union with other terrorist organizations in Iraq and Syria, which will create grave danger in regards of unifying Iraq and the protection of its territory.' Precisely this has happened and the warning was ignored because those in the shadow~ wanted to justify all that hc1s followed in terms of war in the Middle East and using terrorism to terrify populations at home into conceding their freedoms to 'stop the terrorists' (Fig 516).

The plan worked and thanb to Brzezinski and the United States up to 1.5 million Afghan civilians were killed and millions fled the co untry as refugees to countries like Iran and Pakistan.

This b not a contradiction a5 it may appear. Apparent contradiction hides the consi~tent theme: whatever is necessary to advance our agenda we will do and say. 'Al-Qaeda' means 'the base' or' database' and the name comes from the CIA database of Mujahedeen fighters that morphed into th e largely mythical 'Al-Qaeda' that took the blame for 9 / 11.

Iran has been labelled a threat to the world when it hasn't invaded anyone for hundreds of years while the United States is dubbed the peacemaker when surrounding Iran with its military bases (Fig 529). When the US and Britain failed to win public and political support to directly bomb Assad they used the excuse of 'fighting ISIS' to bomb in Syrian territory (Fig 530). As I write Syria is being bombed or attacked by the United States, France, Britain, Turkey and Israel on behalf of the peace- loving 'West' (Fig 531 ). Russia also began bombing in support of Assad in late September 2015 with China and Iran also supporting Assad militarily in the country. President Putin said he was intervening to oppose ISIS, but he had Western-backed 'rebels' attacking Assad in his sights as well.

ISIS is only a seamless continuation in a much expanded form of Western armed and funded terrorism going back to the Mujahedeen and further. They are so well ,urned and funded because aims and money are coming from the United States and other Western sources, plus Saudi Arabia , Qatar and others (Fig 532).

There was no publicly-organised Zionjsm in 1871 when the letter is said to have been written, but there was by the end of that century and I have been emphasising all these years how the Archon agenda is a b l ueprint put together long before events and organisations involved even yet exist. Whatever your view or the detai l ed background to the letter it is clear that Pike's description of the lead-up to World War III fits what is happening in the Mjddle East. Nihilists or Nihilism certainly describe the brain-dead of ISIS - 'a political belief or action that advocates or commits violence or terrorism without discernible constructive goals'. Footage from inside ISIS-held territories has shown the next generation of Nihilists, with very young children being 'trained' to be ISIS fighters and subjected to classic brainwashing and trauma-based mind control techniques. I have exposed at great length in other books these techniques, which are used in mind control programme in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. ISIS- captive children are ordered from the earliest age to listen and obey at all times and never question or they will be killed. Young children are forced to watch executions and even carry them out, and they are programmed to believe that the infidels (anyone not with ISIS) must die. If they refuse to conform they can be mutilated and have limbs cut off. These super-psychopaths are Archons incarnate and express the depth of their empathy-deleted depravity . ISIS is the virus spreading and how life is planned to be in the Brave New World in which the state controls children from birth while parents as we know them are no more.

They also manipulate visitor numbers and listings to suppress traffic and, in the case of Google/You Tube, remove advertising revenue from videos challenging their masters. This happened to me with a video exposing what is really happening in Syria which has been watched, at the time of writing, by nearly 350,000 people. Most alternative media researchers and blogger s accept a meagre income to do their work full-time and the little they were getting from Google/YouTube advertising revenue (ba s ed on video views) was essential for many to continue. Thjs is why Google/YouTube have been targeting that. These giant corporations and their controllers might seem all-powerful, but their knocking knees and chattering teeth can be s een in the fear they have of exposure and an awakened humaruty to the point where they feel the need to undermine people often working out of their bedrooms. For all their arrogance , they are pathetic little boys in short trousers. Another plan is to stop people linking to articles on other website s without permission. This is designed to stop the flow of information on alternative sites that link to mainstream articles while putting them into their true context. I completely understand that it is wrong to cut and paste articles from one site to another and take the traffic for that; but overwhelmingly the alternative media links to the site concerned and cumulatively sends enormous amounts of traffic (and thus advertising revenue) to these mainstream websites . But crushing the alternative media is far more important to these terrified people than even money. No matter, we'll always find a way. The case of G oogle/You Tube is an example of a recurring sequence and technique of the takeover. Archon corporations first destroy the opposition, secure a monop oly or virtual monopoly; and then dictate who can do what. Amazon is in the process of doing precisely this - not least in terms of books and publishing. Jt is vital that aJtemative information source s do not become dependent on these corporations and find di stribution and circulation systems of their own. US National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has even revealed documents that confirm British and American intelligence operations are employing people to post comments on social media, forums and You Tube to discredit researchers and use psychological manipulation on their audience to disrupt and 'promote di strust'.

David Evans, a fuU-time or part-time consultant for eleven years to the Australian Greenhouse Office (now the Department of Climate Change), said he had checked the maths in climate models and found that the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has over-estimated future global wamung by as much as 10 times (on purpose I say). Evans said: 'Yes, C02 has an effect, but it's about a fifth or tenth of what the IPCC says it is. C02 is not driving the climate; it caused less than 20 per cent of the global warming in the last iew decades. The model architecture was wrong. Carbon dioxide causes only minor warming. The climate is largely driven by factors outside our control . .. ... It took me years to figure this out, but finally there is a potential resolution fig ur e 556: How promotors are bought and dissentel'!, between the insistence of the climate silenced. scientists that C02 is a big problem, and the empirical evidence that it doesn't have nearly as much effect as they say. Evans said that his discovery 'ought to change the world' but 'the political obstacles are massive'. He had earlier talked about those obstacles and what was actually driving the fraudulent cLimate change agenda. He said: 'I am a scientist who was on the carbon gravy train, understands the evidence, was once an alarmist, but am now a skeptic.' (Fig 556) He said the whole idea that carbon djoxide is the main cause of warming was based 'on a guess that was proved false by empirical evidence during the 1990s, but the gravy train was too big, with too many jobs, industries, trading profits, political careers, and the possibility of world government and total control riding on the outcome'. Evans said that 'governments and their tame climate scientists now outrageously maintain the fictjon that carbon dioxide is a dangerous pollutant', rather than admit they are wrong even when the evidence is overwhelming. The climate change fictjon is being dismantled by scientists like these and dogged researchers and in its desperation The System is proposing to make illegal any questioning of the official Lie worldwide. What is described as 'a semi-secret, international conference of top judges' proposed in 2015 to make it illegal for anyone to question alleged scientific evidence for human-caused global warming (which isn't happening). 'Climate Change and the Law' was held in London's Supreme Court and funded by the Supreme Court (taxpayer), UK government (taxpayer) and the United Nations Environment Program (taxpayer).

To give y ou some idea of what they mean by human settlement zones we had the then Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, announcing in 2012 the building of an initial 165,000 micro-units 30 feet by 10- bigger than a prison cell, but smaller than a mobile home (Fig 558). This c ontrasts with billionaire Bloomberg's property portfolio that includes a New Y ork home 40 times larger than the micro units and an estate in Bermuda.

Around 80 percent of present day America would be no-go areas for the population and there's a similar agenda for every country. Anyone who thinks this can't be true should look at the map of the United States demanded by Agenda 2 1/2030 and the Biodiversity Treaty (Fig 559).

Anything that comes out of the 313 United Nations in terms of major policy, Figure 565: Wh;itever vou w;int mC' lo say- no problem . goals and initiatives is the Archon agenda. No surprise then that Agenda 21 (and the climate change lie) operate through the UN, and in 2015 came its updated and repacked version called Agenda 2030. This is about the date when key pillars of the pl anned Archon global fascist s tate are due to be in place with many more to follow. Agenda 2030 - a new universal agenda to use its own description - was agreed at a special UN summit in September 2015 and commits countries to 'a new agenda for sustainable development'. The plan consists of 17 ' Sustainable Development Goals' and 169 associated targets and in the words of a European Union statement 'mobilises all countries and stakeholders towards their achievement and affecting domestic policies.' Put this through an Orwellian language translation unit and you get: 'Imposing the will of those who control the UN on everyone in the world.' They used the Pope again to sell this deceit as you would expect as the front man for the Archontic Church of Babylon while other Archontic assets sang from the song sheet to herald the coming of a 'new world' (Fig 565). Well, they were right on that, at least, but it's not the new world they were describing. Most of those who gave their support would have been clueless about what they were buying into. They have no idea what is really going on. The European Union statement said it alJ without, of course , defining the true context: The new 2030 Agenda will re-define how the international community works together on a global commitment to a different kind of future for people and the planet- one which will put the world on a path towards sustainable development. While the Millennium Development Goals (MDGsl targeted developing countries, the 2030 Agenda is the first-ever global agreement setting a universal, comprehensive agenda for action that will affect all countries, including domestic policies. There you have it - what I have been warning was coming for so long. They are describing the emergence of a global dictatorship to impose policy and action across the whole spectrum of human society by tel.ling national governments what they will and will not do.

Human society may be run by evil people but without ill-informed idiots in positions of power, they would not be able to it. Popul ation cull A cursory glance at the biodiversity map of the United State s makes clear why a major part of Agenda 21 /2030 is a dramatic reduction in the human population. Among the methods to achieve this already underway are cumulatively deadly chemical additives in food, drink and water supplies, laboratory- created diseases, vaccines, starvation, an immensely irradiated atmosphere, falling sperm counts and many others (see The Perception Deception for detailed background to the population cull). Humans a.re already toxic time bombs. A draft copy of the United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment demands that the world population be slashed to a billion (it's more than seven billion as I write). Television producer Aaron Russo said that Nick Rockefeller told him in their conversation thc1t the population had to be reduced by at least half. Archontics such as CNN founder Ted Turner and Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, the vaccine, GMO and death panel promotor, are vocal in their support of such aspirations, as are the £/-lite i.n general. Gates's father, William H. Gates Sr., once headed Planned Parenthood, an organisation that started life in the eugenics movement.

People (mostly the elderly) are in effect murdered by doctors by withdrawing medfrines and food once the doctor decrees they are going to die. There are many examples of patients taken off these 'pathways' after pressure from loved ones who have gone on to live for years. We are only seeing the foot in the door at the moment (Fig 566). Once people reach an age where they can no longer serve The System the psychopaths want rid of them (Fig 567). Archon agent, mega-psychopath and arch manipulator Henry Kissinger called them and others who don't serve The System 'useless eaters' (Fig 568). Falling sperm counts around the world are also related to the cull, with scientists warning that we will soon read, the point where fertility is c ompromised. A large Spanish study revealed sperm counts had fallen by up to 38 percent in a decade with toxins being a major factor. Special mention was given to contraceptive drugs peed into the water supply and Bisphenol A or BPA, a hormone disrupter used to coat tin cans and make plastic food containers, bottles, and cash re gister receipts. None of this is by chance. Why would a Californian biotech company called Epicyte patent a gene in 2001 that makes men and women sterile and infertile if ingested? Why would they genetically-e11gi11eer the gene into com seeds? Another 'why' - why would Monsanto and Dupont form a joint venture to buy the Epicyte company to 'commercialise' the Epicyte gene? Epicyte president Mitch Hein said: 'We have a hothouse filled with corn plants that make anti-sperm antibodies' and he suggested this cou ld be a solution to overpopulation. Rjma E. Laibow, Medical Director of the Natural So lutions Foundation, pointed out that the Food and Drug Administration {FDA) was blocking the public's right to know if they are eating this gene: Do you want to know ii the fcxxi that you're eating contains the Epicyte genet Sure you do. How about the iood that your children are eating, or your grandchildren? Sure you do. But the FDA, the Fraud and Death Administration, has made sure that under current laws it is illegal for you to have that information. The population cuJI is being planned in mulHple ways, some cumulative, some instant, and we'll be seeing more come to light that we didn't know about now. I guess culling the population will also be easier when all the men are dead, right? Clearing the land Agenda 21 /2030 and the biodiversity programme require vast numbers of people to be removed from vast are,i.s of land worldwide and this process has begun.

Their agents assess what needs to happen to make it impossible for a target to remain in rural situ and off they go to make that happen. If the necessary laws don't exist they are either passed at a pace or they do it any way.

And tl1at's the reason for doing it - Agenda 21 /2030. President Obama created a White House Rural Council th.rough a no-debate Presidential Executive Order that involves the Department of Defense and all the agencies required to impose Agenda 21 / 2030. President Liar said this was to improve life in rural areas when it is part of the campaign to destroy it. The Council has been described as 'the greatest threat to independent and family farming and ranching' and ' a war council ... which has declared its intention to mount an attack on property owners across the nation ... to remove as many as possible from valued agricultural lands across the country'. An Obama Executive Order entitled 'National Defense Resources Preparedness' allows the government to 'legally' seize all land, farms (including livestock and crops), property, industry and business, food production and clistribution, health resources, energy and water sources, and transportation, among much else. Control of water even trumps control of food in terms of survival and both are being pursued with a vengeance. The Environmental Protection Agency is claiming rights to all ditches, gullies - even those that appear only temporarily after rain or melting snow - by defining them as 'waterways' under the Clean Water Act. Agenda 21 /2030 wants all water controlled by a central water management agency. People are being jailed for collecting rainwater and a guy called Gary Harrington from WHO OWNS TH6 WEST?

Control of food is further centralised every time an independent farm is vacated and a corporation moves in. New laws, including zoning laws, are making it harder and harder for people to grow their own food, and the plan is to eventually ban it altogether.

UN treaties ban weather manipulation for malevolent and military reasons, and why would they ban something that wasn't possible? American scientist J. Marvin Herndon wrote in the lntenintionnl Journal of E11z,ironme11fal Research and Public Health in 2015: The recent calls for open discussion of climate co ntrol or geoengineering tend to obscure the fact that the world's military and civilian sectors have modified atmospheric <.anditions for many decades as has heen described by science historian , James R. Fleming. Some of the early weather-modification research resulted in programs like Project Skywater ( 1961-1988), the U.S. Bureau of R ec lamation 's effort to engineer 'the rivers of th e sky'; the U.S. Army's Operation Figure 574: HMRP-type technology has multiple uses and among them is weather and earthquake manipulation. Ranch Hand (1961-1971), in which the herbicide Agent Orange was an infamous part; and its Project Popeye ( 1967-1971 ), used to 'make mud , not war' over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. These few examples of weather- modification , all oi them secret at the time they were engaged, show that the weather is in the words of the military , 'a force multiplier' . Weather modification entered a new stage with technology that can heat and manipulate the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere (37 miles to 620 miles above the Earth's surface). The sa me technology can trigger earthquakes. Weather is, like everything, information with a particular frequency. If you technologically generate that frequency you manifest it s holographic expression - like weather extremes and earthquakes. The High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program or HAARP ins tallation in Alaska has been widely exposed by rese,1rchers for its impact on weather and earthquakes (Fig 574). HAARP is an atmospheric heater and there are others around the world that operate in much the same way. HAARP-like technology bounce s high-powe r radio waves off the ionosphere and back to earth and has the capability for Figure 575: Extrt.mes oi rain are eas\\' ro generate. everything from weather manipulation to earthquakes, mind control and X-raying the Earth for resource s .

In 2011 the US Army Corps of Engineers said they had to blow-up levees to stop the Mis s ouri and Mississippi reaching dangerous levels. This caused catastrophic flooding of farming land over a wide area. Three weeks later the farmers and property owners received letter s offering to buy their land on behalf of the government. The letters came from ... the Army Corps of Figure 576: Ex rr e= of rain or no-rain have rhe same outcome - ~etting people off the land . Engineers (Fig 575). Britain's wettest summer on record in 2012 and the long-term heat and drought in the United States was devastating for farmers and growers either side of the Atlantic (Fig 576). These weather extremes were blamed on the strange behaviour of the jet streams, fast-flowing air currents that largely direct winds from west to east- 'rivers of the sky'. Jet stream stability brings far more predictable weather. They are created by the Earth's rotation and atmospheric /,eating which is what HAARP-like technology is all about. No wonder Bernard Eastlund who wrote and secured HAARP patents for his corporate masters said: 'HAARP can steer the jet stream.' He also spoke of a 'Jet Stream Solar Power Satellite' of which he said: ... a dual use satellite which can focus microw a ve energy into a jet stream to change the direction (steer) of a jet stream . It does this by triggering turbulen ce in the flowing air which decreases the flow velocity of an edge region of the flow and generating a pressure differentia l that changes the direction oi the bulk air flow. HAARP technology is based on the work of Nikola Tesla whom Eastlund mentions in the patents. Tesla was able to cause lightning s trike s abo ve his laboratory in New York and make tl1e ground shake violently in earthquake-fashion with technology he developed in the first half of the 20th century. What can they do now? Scientists and researchers ha ve spoken of 'the atmospheric jet stream meandering all over North America' causing 'prolonged cold snaps on the East Coa s t, California drought and frozen mornings in the South'. The global warming cult s creams 'climate change' supported by the unquestioning and robotic media as two birds are smacked with the same stone.

HA ARP came on line in the 1990s (Fig 577). Francis said that the jet stream's unusually large swing to the north had the potential for warmer and drier weather in California, where a prolonged and extreme drought led to water rationing, disappearing lakes and rivers and devastated farmers and food production (Fig 578). All are Archontic goals. Jennifer Francis is not saying this strange behaviour oi the jet stream is caused technologically, but I am saying look at the facts. Extremes of weather and droughts serve the agenda to destroy independent farming and force people off the land; weather extremes in recent years have been caused by changes in jet ..,treams; HAARP technology can 'steer the jet stream'; weather-modifying changes to the jet stream have been identified since the 1990s; HAARP began operation in the 1990s. Droughts are easy to generate through weather- mc1nipulation technology and allow for the control and depletion of water ~upplies. You can't survive without water and so you have to move to where you can find some. This is planned to be to the human ~ttlement zones. Fracking is allowed to continue through the most e,treme droughts despite using stunning amounts of water and polluting ground water sources irreparably. The fracking insanity is also connected to the get-them-off-the-Land conspiracy (Fig 579). Fracking injects toxic fluid (water mixed with sand and chemicals) at a high pre.,sure to fracture shale rocks and access oil and natural gas. Injected pollution of 600 chemicals that include lead, uranium, mercury, ethylene glycol, radium, •, Figure .580: Anything goes wht>n something is on the w i~h li,1 - and tracking is. methanol, hydrochloric acid and formaldehyde seeps into groundwater.

Each fracking operation involves behveen one and eight million gallons of water that can never be used again because of its extreme chemical content.

Fracking is being promoted by the same governments that sell the myth about human-cau s ed 'global warming' when the fracking process releases the greenhouse gas methane as well as cancer- causing radon gas which adds to radiation levels. This would appear to be a contraction, but once again it's not. Promoting the lie about global warming and releasing a greenhouse ga s through fracking has a common theme - serving the agenda for human control. Corporations like Nestle have also been allowed to take huge amounts of water in California to bottle and sell while the people have been rationed. The reason is the same: Nestle is part of the Web and the people are not. Weakening the enemy A hit-list of food, drink, vaccines, multiple forms of toxicity and radiation are being used in the cumulative population cull and to advance the Hunger Games Society by weakening people mentally, emotionally and Figure 582: Genetit mutation ior all to sre.

George Orwell (1984) and Aldous Huxley (Bm r>e New World) both had connections to the Fabians. Its name d erives from Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus who was famous for wearing down the enemy over long periods to avoid battles that could be decisive either way. Once the enemy was believed to be weakened enough through hunger, fatigue and other s reason s Fa bius and his troops walked in unchallenged. This sa me technique is being deployed again st humanity by Archons and their hybrid s.

The idea is to make people exhausted, unfit, obese and suffering from ,1 list of disea ses and ailments (including those of the mind) that lead to still more toxicity in the form of pharmaceutical drugs (Fig 582). We can see this happening ever more obviously. Everyt hin g people do and everywhere they go involves contact with toxins.

Make a note of the chemical and radiation toxins you come into contact with in a single day and you'll what I mean by bombarded. It is also sobering to think that HAARP-type technology can generate electromagnetic fields which amplify the strength of paisons and chemicals in the body by a thousand times to where they become instantly lethal through a process called 'cyclotron re sonance' . I have made cleaI throughout the book the Archon obsession with genetics and mutation (distortion) of the hu man body. Radiation is accepted to cause genetic mutation but most people don't realise that the same is true of food, drink, vaccinl!s and other multiple forms of to xicity. They are, in the form that we see them, only holographic reflections ot energetic information fields. What we call toxicity or poisons are in their base form deeply distorted energy field~ of equally distorted information . They are a computer virus and om toxic world is really our Archon virus world . The deluge of toxins and radiation is the virus spreading. Chemically-infested toxic food and drink, toxic vaccinations, cleaning the cooker, washing the pots, splashing on the sun block and spraying under the arms are actually infusing highly-distorted, chaotic and malevolent energy fields - the Archon virus - into the fie l ds of Body-Mind which can absorb and sync with those distortions. Health is balance and 'ease' while ill-health is imbalance and dis-ease. When distortions (toxicity , radiation) are absorbed by the fields of Body-M i nd this plays out into the hologram and people say' doctor, I've got a problem' . Whatever is happening in the hologram is a reflection of what is happening in the human energy fields of b ody and mind. Toxins and radiation can affect people just as much mentally and e motionall y as they can 'physically'. The principle is the same as a pipe pouring pollution into a river which then changes its own state to reflect what is coming out of the pipe (Fig 587). Humans are reflecting more and more what is coming Figure 587: Poisoned world . out of the fridge, tap, can, bottle, aerosol and the ever-thickening radiation soup that we Fig ur e 588: Never did me any hann ."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"\\ Setr e NL , ote .s LI ;and , ans n. :I 1e tic ch a Ith ,ta 1g in .1 s t e as 1t is ing 1d World Ant'\\v (21 now live within (Fig 588). All those distortions and mo re are the Arc/1011 virus. Every time we use toxins in their endless forms we are dealing with the Archon virus - distortions of the Infinite order of balance and harmony. The 'Demi urge' is a self-aware virus and everything from Archons to vaccines are different manifestations of it. Frankenstein food This brings me with as many exclamation marks as I can muste r to genetically- modified organisms or GMO (Fig 589). Here we have another expression - a vitally important one - of the Archon virus to distort Body-Mind. GMO is being imposed on humanity by the biotech industry and most notably by one of the corporate centres of undiluted evil - Monsanto. They enjoy enthusiastic support from Archontics like mass vaccine-promotor Bill Gates who funds and supports so many pillars of the agenda. Bill ' GMO is good' Gates owns 500,000 shares in Monsanto worth tens of millions of dollars and promotes Monsanto GMO as the 'solution' to world hunger when it is designed to expand hunger exponentially by destroying alternatives and the very soil itself (Fig 590). Throughout the world thls is being shown to be true, with a farmer committing suicide in India about every half an hour in the wake of failing GMO crops and the cost of buying Monsanto poisons essential to GMO. These include 327 Figure 589: Geneticallv-modiiying humans - and killing them. Figure 590: It can'! he bec.:iuse he doesn'I know - not with his track-record oi tunding agenda projects.

Before Monsanto turned up we had the (ironically) sus tai11able method of crops from one season providing seeds at no cost for the next.

People will have to decide for themselves what his motivations are, but given the crucial role played by hi s funded projects I am personally not coming down on the side of ignorance (Fig 593). Maybe his mate, Bono, singer with the band U2 , could tell us more when he's not also promoting GMO for the developing world. Well, it's worked so well in lndia didn't it, Bono? Europeans have resisted the imposition of GMO far more than Americans, but the European Union and especially the Briti s h government are desperate for widespread use of GMO and will do everything they can to bring this about . The Totalitari,rn Tiptoe is being feverishly employed while non-GMO, organic and nutritio us so urces of food are being targeted by EU, British and North American fascist agencies to delete al tern atives to Monsanto 'food'. The plan is for only GMO to be available eventually. A report in 2015 highlighted plans to genetically-modify most of the chocolate industry by flcx1ding 70 percent of glob ,11 cocoa production with G!l.10 cocoa tree hybrids. Funding is being provided by major corporations and the plan is supported by the US Department of Agriculture. Another vehicle for promoting untested genetic engineering to infest the poor and hungry with GMO is the UN World Food Program, funded by again government s and corporations. Hidden Hand manipulation uses every trick and invented most of them. GMO is safe and the Moon is made of cheese Health effects of GMO have been monumental in the United Stat es and this was as planned as it was inevitable. Vandana Shiva, a prominent opponent of GMO and Monsanto in Lndia, said: 'You cannot insert a gene into a seed and caJI it life - you haven't created life, instead you have polluted it.' I would strongly advise that you watch a documentary available on You Tube entitled Geneti c Ro11frttc which reveals tha t since genetically-modified food became significant in the American diet in the 1990s, canc e r, heart disease, autism, obesity, Alzheimer's, Parkinson ' s and food allergies hav e soared.

When government dark su its tell you that somet hing is within official safety limit s don't for goodness sake mistake this for meaning it is safe. This is not what 'safety limits' are there for. Their job is not to protect people but protect Archon corporations so they can legally irradiate and poison the population within the 'law'. S tudie s have found an increa se of up to 70 times in birth defects of children born to workers on farms spray ing Roundup I glyphosate and it has been linked to a stream of health problems including Alzheimer's disease; autism; anencephaly (birth defect); multiple cancers; Celiac d isease and gluten intolerance; kidne y disease; colitis; depression; diabetes; heart disease; hypoth yroidism; inflammatory bowel disease (Leaky Gut Syndrome); liver disea se; multiple sclerosis; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Parkinson's disease; pregnancy problems (infertility, miscarriages, stillbirths); obesity; respiratory illnes ses. Add to this the growing damage to soil fertility and the infiltration by GMO of non-GMO plants, crops and vegetation and it is dear what a weapon this is for the Archon agenda .

Bee s are an Archon target with their essential contribution to plant life. Their populations have been plummeting through herbicide\"i, pesticides and Archontically-imposed GMO monoculture (while mendaciously promoting 'biodiversity'). These deprive bees of pollen nutrition (Fig 598). This ha!, led to the phenomenon of Colony Collapse Dis order which is destroying hives on a very large scale .:1nd bees pollinate about a third of the crop~ grown worldwide .

But that's not the plan, Steve.

He was told they were infected with a disease known as foulbrood.

By then Ingram had lost his bees, including the hive and queen he was using for his Monsanto Roundup research. Beeologics, one of the leading companies researching the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder, was bought by ... Monsanto. You get the picture. Entrapping percept i on GMO has been introduced to mutate DNA and its ability to receive and transmit information to further squeeze the frequency range it can access. Fluoride is added to drinking water and toothpaste to calcify the 'third-eye' pineal gland and suppress brain function for the same reason (Fig 599). I have been exposing for decades the effect of fluoride on the brain, intellect, teeth and other parts of the body, and in 2015 even the United States government had to bow to a mountain of evidence and lower the recommended level in drinking water. Officials admitted that that Americans had been 'overdosing' on fluoride and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (joke) found that some 40 percent of Americans have dental fluorosis from fluoride consumption when the official reason for fluoride in water is protecting teeth (Fig 600). What they didn't mention was the damage to brain function and intellect and the perception isolation caused by calcifying the pineal gland. Dr Arline Geronimus, a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center for Advanced Study, led a team of biologists and social researchers which discovered 'alarming deterioration in DNA of America's urban poor' with 'accelerated aging at the cellular level, and chronic stress linked both to income level and racial-ethnic identity driving this physiological Phantom Se lf A B Figure 599: It's worth repeating this image to cmpha~ise the chemical war on human perception. get some.

Genetic mutations once instigated can then be passed on to the next generation which will be from the start weaker in body, mind and immune system and far more likely to suffer from diseases and problems now encoded in their software. These include a greater likelihood of inherited obesity, which is largely caused by the constant inflow of toxins that the body deals with by making fat to store them to protect the body from the cumulatively fatal consequences. Geneticist Dr David Suzuki said: Any scientist who tells you they know that GMOs are safe and not to worry about it, is either ignorant or is deliberately lying. Nobody knows what the long-term effect will be. I agree with the first part, but there is a point being missed. When Suzuki says that nobody knows what the long-term effect of GMO will be this is correct with regard to the great majority; but the Hidden Hand does know what the effect will be and it is coldly working towardt> that very end. The Spider in the centre of the Archontic Web controls Monsanto, Big Biotech, Big Food, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Banking and Big Media as it controls Big Government and agencies of Big Government. The UK Independent ran this headline in 2015: 'Gene drive: Scientists sound alarm over ~upercharged GM organisms which could spread in the wild and cause environmental disasters.' Gene drive is the name for a technique to generate ' supercharged' genetically modified organisms that can spread rapidly in the wild. It is described as like a r>irns infection and this is yet another example of the Ardion virus being system,1tically spread throughout the simulation or bad copy. Gene drive is being promoted positively as usual as a way to stop mosquito-borne illnesses, eliminate crop pests and 'vermin' species . But David Gurwitz, a geneticist at Tel Aviv University in Israel, said: 'Just as gene drives can make mosquitoes unfit for hosting and spreading the malaria parasite, they could conceivably be designed with gene drives carrying cargo for delivering lethal bacterial toxins to humans.

Revolving doors of personnel moving between corporati ons and government 'protection' agencie s have become legendary and so have universities and academics on the Big Biotech payroll to promote and lobby fo r their products (Fig 603). Toxins, drug s, vaccines and GMO are allowed through to the public with virtually no proper chec ks. Everyone within Mainstream Everything is ultimately working for the Spider to ensure its will is always obeyed. Some are knowingly part of the plot (the very few) while others do so for money and power, out of fear of not doing what the boss says, and, in the case of the great majority, out of sheer ignorance of what is really going on. All these facets, elements and subjects are connected to the Archontic hijack of human society by hijacking human perception. GMO and endless sources of toxin!- and radiation weaken body and mind and mutate DNA into a distorted state to block ac cess to higher frequencies to perceive beyond the Matrix. Destroy independent farming an d growing and you hand control of all food production and distribution to Archontic government and corporations and it's the same with water supplies. They know tha t GMO will eventually contaminate every other plant and crop until there is nothing except GMO. Monsanto and Big Biotech patent their seeds and they own the rights to everything they genetically engineer to dictate who can use them. They plan to own th e human body in the same way through patented technology designed to be implanted and other patented genetic manipulation. Abundant non-GMO seed varieties are be ing deleted and biotech companies are being allowed to patent original seeds they had nothing to do with purely on the basis that they were the first to ask. Globc1l monoculture puts food security under fundamental threat because anything that damages or kills the monoculture crop varieties destroys the human food supply (F ig 604). Check how many varieties of vegetables and fruit have been lost since the turn of the 20th century and you'll be shocked. Rare and older breed s of farm animals are bei ng killed on the orders of government mafia in countries like the United States and Canad a until only corporation breeds remain. Targeting small and organic producers of non - GMO food is aimed at removing all alternatives to DNA-mutating GMO in the s am e way that alternative medicine and nutrition supplements are being targeted to destro y choice. These attacks are not only on the body, but also on the mind. Studies have shown that children on a diet of predominantly processed foods have a lower IQ-j us t as they do it they consume fluoride in drinking water and toothpaste. By contrast th e Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health reports: 'Food packed with vitamins and nutrients notably helped boost mental performance as youngsters got older.' Archo ns and their hybrids want humans to have barely functioning slave minds, not intellig e nt ones. What we call 'nutrition' is really energy and information.

Body and mind go into energy deficit on the corporation diet and the cumulative effect is premature aging, iJJness, death and impaired mental function. Big Biotech's campaign in the UnHed States to stop compulsory labelling of GMO products is to stop people having the right to choose whether to be poisoned and genetically mutated. Monsanto and other biotech companies know that lob of people would not eat GMO if labelling gave them a choice. American states are threatened with lawsuib over GMO labelling by Monsanto who have for bigger pockets, ilnd then,~ is always a colosc,al difference in spending power between the corporations and the public in GMO labelling referendums. Plus the fact that whether or not these votes are subject to rigging (bet on it) there are always breathtaking numbers of Phantom Self sofhvare in labelling referendums who vote against their right to know what is in their food and what it is made from. A more profound definition of insanity l can hardly imagine, but th en this is bad copy Earth, land of Phantom Self. In your face •. • Now, having laid out the multi-faceted and unfolding agenda for human enslavement here's a chap who predicted it all in 1969. Dr Richard Day was a Rocketeller and Zionist in~ider, professor of paediatrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and e,ecutive of the Rockefeller-controlled Planned Parenthood which began in the eugenics movement and wa-, expo:.ed in 2015 for selling foetus body parts. l quoted him earlier about a suppre:,sed cure for cancer that he said was on file at what G now the Rockdeller Univen,ity. Day knew about much of the pl,rn for humanity gleaned from hb big Rockefeller connections in the same way th,,t George Orwell and Aldous Huxley had insider ources for their prophetic 1984 and Brave Nt•w World. Day Web speaking in 1969 to a closed meeting of paediatricians in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 20 yea~ after Orwell published his so ,,ccurate portrayal of a police state society that is now clearly in the process of happening. The paediatricians were abked not take notes or uc;e recording equipment because (for whatever reason) Day was going to tell them how the world was going to change. One doctor, Lawrence Dunegan, did taJ...e note~ and lx•fore he died in 2004 he gave to a series of radio interviews detailing what Day had described. Thebe were just s ome of the elements of the nev, • society that Day !-oaid, nearly 50 years ago, were planned: Population control; permission to have babies; redirecting the purpose of .,ex - sex without reproduction and reproduction without .;ex; contraception univer-:;ally available to all; ,;;ex education and canalizing I genetic manipulation] of youth a-. a tool of world government; t,1x-funded abortion as population control; encouraging anything-goes homosexuality; technology used for reproduction without se,i fomilie\" to diminish in importance; euthanasia and the 'demjse piJJ'; limiting acces .... to affordable medical care making eliminating the elderly easier; medicine would be tightly controlled; elimination of private doctors; new difficult-to-diagnose and untreatable disease~; suppressing cancer cure~ as a mean of population control; inducing heart attacks as a form of as..;assination; education as a tool for accelerating the onset of puberty ,llld evolution; blending all religions ... the old religions will have to go; changing the Bible through re\\'isions of key words; restructuring education as,, tool of indoctrination; more time in school!>, but pupib 'wouldn't learn anything'; controlling who has acce<;s to"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"B6 information; schools as the hub of the community; some books would just disappear from the li braries; changing l aws to promote moral and social chaos; encouragement of drug abuse to create a jung le atmosphere in cities and towns; promote alcoho l abuse; restrictions on trave l; the need for more jails, and using hospitals as jails; no more psychological or physical secu rity; crime used to manage society; curtailment of US industrial pre-eminence; s hifti ng popuJatio ns and economies - tearing out the social roots; sports as a tool of social engineering and change; sex and violence inculcated through entertainment; implan t ed ID cards - microchips; food control; weather control; knowing how peop le respond - making them do what you want; falsified scientific research !see 'global wanning'); use of terrorism; surveillance, implants, and tel ev isions that watch you; the arrival of the totalitarian global system . Every facet of what he said in 1969 h,,s happened or is happening because the plan was set in motion a l ong 'time' ago and has been being rolled out by the century, decade and now by the hour. 'Canalizing of youth as a too l of world government' can be explained by this dictionary definition : 'Cana lizing selection - the elimination of genotypes tha t render developing individuals sensitive to environmental fluctuations.' Current genetic-modifications of the human body are in part preparing for a much- changed energetic and radiation environment and atmosphere for rea s on s I will come to in the next chapter. One other point to highlight is about ' blending all religions ... 'the old religions wi ll have to go.' They plan a one-wor ld religion to worship the Demiurge and this is what high Freemason Albert Pike was referring to when he said that with the end of traditional religion humanity 'wiJI receive the true light through the univer s al manifestation of the pure doctr i ne of Lucifer.' Divide and rule religions have served the Archon plan magnificently , but in its final form they want a 'one' of everything- including religion. Listen to Pope Francis calling for a unity of religions. It sounds good on the surface but what is unsa id is that this is the tiptoe to one religion. The shadow E/- lite know that religions are worshiping the same Demiurge 'god' and they want to make it open and official when they have secured enough power to do so . Richard Day, incidentally, worke d in weather manipulation during the Second World War - you know, the weather manipuJation they c<1n't do. Here are so me of Day's more detailed comments that relate to subjects I have covered. They are the words of Dr Dunegan describ i ng what Day said and remember this wa:. in 1969: Po li ti cs He said t/wt very ft.rw people really know how government works.

Richard Day also said that there would be mass movements and migrations of people without roots in their new locations because 'traditions are easier to change in a place where there are a lot of transplanted people, as compared to trying to change traditions in a place where people grew up and had an extended family, where they had roots.' Remember what I said earlier about one of the prime reason for orchestrating the ma s migrations trom the Midd le East and Africa into Europe with the targeting especially of Germany which has such a sense of its own traditions and culture. Chancellor Merkel knows exactly what she is doing and why. Day even ~aid in 1969 that soccer would be promoted in the United States because it wa.., an international game and would help to break down a sense of a unjque cttlh1re underpinned by baseball and American football. l have been trying to show people for so long that almost everything is manipulated and part of the plan. All that J have described in this chapter - in fact, chapter after chapter - is to advance the total enslavement of the human race which I have been warning about for a quarter of a century amid constant ridicule and abuse. People might not want to believe wha t I .,m saying, but that doesn't stop it being true. Here and no further These are some themes to watch for and challenge at every opportunity to slow down the march of tyranny until we delete it altogether: Anything related to changes listed by Richard Day; anything that forces people into cities c1nd denies access to rural lands; anything that makes survival harder for small formers and businesses to the benefit of corporations; attacks on independent food growing and alternatives to GMO; attac~ on"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"alternative forms of medicine, non-drug se health treatment and supplements; Ne anything forced upon us without choice the - like mandatory vaccinations; anything Sy that prevents free movement, makes ha travel more difficult or proposes new by high-speed railways between centres of TI major population without justification or through a sudden change of policy as in to the United States; anything that advanc es O Figure 605: Stand up now or take the consequences. the police state and increases st surveillance; any further centralisation of e1 power and decision-making; attacks on the family unit, parental rights and increased control of the state and schools (the state ) . 1 over the upbringing of children - including those removed from loving parents and put n into 'care' or forced adoption for spurious reasons; anything that makes it easier for h doctors to legally kill people either directly or by removing what they need to survive ; v government policies that target the poor and reward the rich. Be aware of anything that relates to centralised collectivism under terms like 'common' as in common core, common goals and common purpose. The latter is the name of a training organisation preparing 'leaders' for the post-industrial, post-democratic society. 'Consensus' is another version of 'common' with con.citant attempts to manipulate the public 'consensus' to agree to follow the Archon agenda without even realising there is one. Political 'consensus' is almost complete with political parties differing largely only by rhetoric. Manipulclting and imposing the consensu s also involves marginalising and vilifying anyone who questions and challenges the consensus - oppose all efforts to suppress and destroy the alternative media. When world events happen always ask: 'Who benefits?' And who benefits from people believing the official story of what has happened? I include in this extremes of weather and earthquakes for the reasons I have explained. We stand up and look this in the eye or we run. But there is nowhere to run , so we better get on with it (Fig 605). In a sane world the mainstream media would be exposing and warning about all this, but instead they condemn and ridicule those who do - the inversion again. They apply the label 'conspiracy theorist' to discredjt anyone exposing the truth when the very terms conspiracy theorist or theory were invented by the CIA to discredit those exposing the lies surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy and others in the 1960~. Most journalists - not all, but most - really are pathetic and a disgrace not only to the public in general but to their own families who will have to live in the world they are playing their vital role in making happen. There are executives and journalists who are knowingly serving the Archon agenda but most do so out ot ignorance and fall for the hoax that their 'good education' h.u. made them informed and intelligent. Anyone who believes what they are told by the mainstream media should listen to the experiences of German journalist and editor Udo Ulfkotte who h,~s revealed how he worked for governments and intelligence agencies and wrote stories that suited them .

First they hijack perception by making an energetic copy of the original reality and manipulate genetics (receiver- transmission processes) of the target population to tune them into a fake reality. From this point they work to distort the copy to a stage where it reflects their own frequency and preferred 'atmosphere' by the systematic generation of death, destruction, fear and suffering technologically supported by massive increases in atmospheric radiation and nuclear war. All of these energetic sources and many more transform what was originally copied into a reality that c;uits the Archon virus in its quest for total control. The endgame in these repeating scenario s is to fuse the population with technology controlled by Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is just a fancy cover-name for 'Them' - tire riirus.

Tell me how you would explain the contradictions between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of belief, or the s tupidity of his contradictory behaviour.'

There is a trade-off here between what you need for total control and the danger that at least so me people will open their minds further than is good for you. Mind expansion and development necessary for eventual technological awareness has made unacceptable many things once done openly such as human sacrifice and Fig u re 60S: The Schumann cavity. overt rule by royal bloodline. Many more people also refuse to 'know their place' and this is a dangerous period for the Archon agenda. Research into transhumanist technology opens the way to the realisation tha t we live in a simulation as technological developments mimic the very reality we are experiencing. We live in a 'time' of enormous danger but also fantastic opportunity, and they are pushing through transhumanism as fast as they can to lock down human awareness technologically before it can wake up to the truth on ..1 scale that would brin g the Archon house down. Technological sub-reality A global technological web of total control by Artificial Intelligence (Demiurge virus) is being rolled out by the day and the aim is to create a sub-reality between the ground and the ionosphere in that part of the Earth' s atmosphere known as the Schumann Cavity or Schumann Cavity Resonance (Fig 608). German physicist Winfried Otto Schumann is credited with discovering this electromagnetic resonance in the extremel y low frequency or ELF range between 6 and 8 Hz. This is within the frequency of hum an brain activity and all biological systems. Harmonic connection between Earth and oth er biological life is possible through this frequency compatibility, but the Archon agenda demands that this harmony be di s torted and the interconnection destroyed. HAARP - type technology, which interacts with the ionosphere, can function within th e same frequency band with potential to achieve thi s end. Sci e nti sts say Earth and the huma n br a in can synchronise at the Schumann res onance frequency of 7.83 Hz and thi s is a means through which all biological life can communicate. Dolphins generate so und wave s of 7.83 Hz . Dr Herbert Konig, Schumann's successor at Munich University, said the dominant brain wave in mammal s is between 6 and 8 Hz. Human alpha brain waves are broadcast in this frequency band while in state of meditation, relaxation and creativity. States of fear, stress and anxiety block alpha wave states and therefore bl ock harmonic connection with everything else. This adds further to a s en se of isolation. Alpha waves are abo very important to the immune system, which is a recurring ta rget of Archon manipulation. Schumann Re s onance operates like a tuning fork to 'entrain ' all biological life in a common and harmonious oscillation. 'Entrainment' is a major aspect to Phantom Self creation and control. Entrainment mean s that the dominant frequency rules perception. If you place three violins together playing the sa me note or frequency and then introduce another violin playing another note or no note this will be 'entrained' by the combined power of the other three and resonate to their frequency.

This, too, is aimed at blocking a conn0ction to expanded awareness. The Demiurge conspiracy is building a frequency prison or tec hnologically-created sub-reality through multiple mean s , including te chnologically-generated radiation, to entrap the human mind in an even more extreme and myopic fake-reality- a fake reality within a fake reality. Given the vast majority are already dbconnected from a powerful and consciou~ connection to Infinite Awareness wh,,t would humanity be like if this gathering frequency prison is allowed to reach ib intended goal? H e re we have still another example of further distorting the 'bad copy' (Fig 610). Studies have already revealed that Schumann resonance is being swamped by the electromagnetic fog or soup amassing from technological sources. Physicist and Sc humann researcher Wolfgang Ludwig said: 'Measuring Schumann re onance in or a round a city has become impossible ... electromagnetic pollution from cell phones ha s forced us to make measurements at sea.' Once Schumann harmonic connections are d istorted ,1nd unravelled fundamental consequences follow mentally, emotionally and ' physically'. Profe!>sor Rutger Wever from the Max Pl,rnck Institute for Behavioural Physiology in Germany proved this when he built an underground bunker i so lated fr om Schumann resonance and employed student volunteer~ to live there for a month. He found that their natural biological rhythms (cir cadian rhythms) w ent walkabo ut a nd they suffered emotional di stress (disharmony) and migraine headaches. Only a brief ex posure to 7.8 H7 brought them back into kilter and symptoms disappeared. Another highly significant aspect to all this is that DNA communic.ites through extremely low fre quency electromagnetic wave s at a frequency of ... 7.83 Hz. This was officially discovered by French virologist Luc Montagnier, joint winner of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. DNA can also be entrained with technological frequencies to res ist expanded communication and cause genetic mutation. Common themes are clear a nd this is the real background to the technological society and transhumanism. Smart is stupid The term 'smart' is being u!>ed for so many technologies and policies today. It's everywhere.

'Smart' is intended to promote the impression that anything 'smart' must be in accordance with its definition of 'having or showing intelligence'. A 'Smart Object' is defin ed as something that 'interact5 with not Onl)· people but also with other Smart Figure 611: The Snwt Grid . Objects'. I have been warning since th e 'smart' era began that all the 'smarts' are designed to communicate and synchronise with all the other smarts to form a global grid of technological wireless communication known as the Smart Grid. This i& planned to be connected with the human Body-Mind through microchips, other transhumanist body-inserts and by operating on the same frequency band as human brain and DNA activity to entr,1in them with the Smart Grid or technological sub-reality. From that moment humans will be nothing more than computer terminals responding to data input from a wireless control grid linking all the 'smart' technologies and many more that won't use that term. Advocates of transhumanism claim that smart environments will create 'a small world where different kinds of smart device are continuously working to make inhabitants' lives more comfortable'. We arc talking in truth about a technological prison cell for every man, woman and child on earth (Fig 611). The Smart Grid will n o! be built and switched on overnight. It is being con s tructed piece by piece before our eyes through the Totalitarian Tiptoe and the process is getting quicker all the time. If you want to hide something put it on public display . Technologies used for aeons by !ht' Archons in their multiple invasions of societies and realities arc being introduced as 'new inventions' when they were known about and developed long ago in the underground bases and other secret locations around the world, especially in the Unit ed States. Technology is relea~d in a pre-determined order using cover stories and cover people to explain where it came from. Computerisation is an example of thb along with smart and other technology essential to global mind, body and emotional control. Are vve really saying that technology crucial to the control agenda just happened to appe ar by sheer good luck just when the control system needed it? People standing in line fur hours to be the first to get the latest release of control-grid technology -I must h,we an iPhone first- is as sickening as it is sad and shows what a grip technology already h as on the human mind. We had the cell phone, then the smartphone, tablet, Bluetooth, smartwatch, Google Glass and now even skin patches that attach an electronic circui t to the s kin and communicate with computers (Fig 612).

A CIA scientist confirmed the microchip ag e nda to me in the 1990 s and he said that in secret development projects they were already small enough to be inserted by hypodermic needles in vaccination programmes. Todn y we call what he wa s talking about 'nanotechnology' which is well beyond the capacity of the human eye to see. Nanoparticles are now used in food, clothing, medicine, shampoo, toothpaste, sun screen and thousands of other products. Some scientists have warned that nanoparticles can change the function of cells and how they communicate, and Figure 614: One ot m a ny techn ol og ie ,; in lhC' To tal itarian Ti pt oe 10 ge tting in~ide th e bod y. significantly mange DNA, but they are ignored given that those outcomes are exactly what is required.

What is energetically coming off these devices to trigger such a magnetic attraction? I suggest it's a form of Artificial Intelligence. A poll for the UK's Channel 4 News in 2015 found that nearly half the parents questioned believed their children were addicted to smartphones and tablets and almost the same number likened thb to emutional dependency (Fig 616) . I was on a train coming into a station one day and lHerally everycme the whole k•ngth of the platform was bent over meo;;merised by smartphones. British newspaper columnist Sarah Vine wrote: They stop childrPn from inter.icting foce-to-face (how many groups of teenagers do you see 1n parks , hunLhed over their phones, nominally together yet lost in their own separate worlds ). What mo st horrifies me is the way s mar1 phones take normal, healthy children and turn 1hem into zombies whose principal pre-occupations are nol schoolwork, riding a hike or even following the latest chart-toppers, hut checking how many 'likes' their lnstagram picture has amassed, or whether their latest video h,1s amassed sufficient comment. At a time when young minds should be questioning and expanding, their horizons shrink to one tiny. glowing screen.

By 2015 some 6h percent of Briton~ had !-,martphones (up from 39 percent in 2012) and they only came on the market in 2007 . Smartphone!-. are the fastest-selling gadget in history with half the adult population owning a smartphone and by 2020 it's estimated the figure will be 80 percent. Smartphones, tablets and personal computers are predicted by then to number around 7.3 billion. Even remote tribes in the Brnzili.1n rainforest have been given smartphones on the grounds of protecting them from violen t ranchers who want their land. Americans spend an average of two hours a day on a smartphone and 80 percent of smartphone O\\.vners are using them within 15 minutes of waking up.

Smart devices are increasingly at the centre of everyday life and if it's not a text or 'checking my emails' (every few minutes) then it's taking a 'selfie'. l'm not saying that people shouldn't take pictures (although an estimated 1.2 billion selfies in the UK alone in 2014 points to more addiction). I' m pointing out where it is all designed to lead and l can tell you it ain't pretty. Smartphones are transhumanist pied pipers. Smart technology is promoted as a mean s of instant communication, but when you are covertly selUng a prison cell you don't highUght the bars and the lock on the door. You focus on the selt-contained accommodation with no utility bills and plenty of time to sleep. Smartphones are about control on multiple levels and they can tell the authorities dose to exactly where you are 24 hours a day. German news magazine Da Spi egel reported seeing top secret documents from the United State s National Security Agency (NSA) revealing how they can access information on phones made by all leading manufacturers including 'contact lists, SMS traffic, notes and location information ,1bout where a user has been'. Let no one tell me that this is not done in connivance with the manufacturers through the Archontic Web which controls both them and the NSA. Edward Snowden, the whistleblower on NSA surveillance now in exile in Russia , apparently told lawyers he met on the run in Hong Kong to put their cell phones in hi s fridge to stop any eavesdropping. Smartphones can be hacked using fake phone 'towers' known as Stingray technology that mimics mobile phone masts and tricks phones into communicating with them. Law enforcement is using these worldwide. Smartphones are a key part of the Totalitarian Tiptoe to total surveillance in which no one will be able to do anything that the authorities can't know about with microphones allowing private conversations to be heard in real time (Fig 618). There is already no privacy worth the name on Planet Smartphone when any action can be instantly videoed or photographed ,1nd passed around the world in minutes on sociaJ media. Smartphones on the brain Electronic commu nication devices addict the brain to con s tant stimulation and this is destroying human attention span (exactly as planned). A study of brain activity among 2,000 people in Canada using electroencephalograms revealed that average human attention since the mobile revolution had fallen to just eight seconds - le ss than that of a"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"354 Fig ure 6 18: Everywher e y ou go ... we'll be watching you.

Surveys have recorded a serious drop in the number of children reading books for pleasure by the end of primary school because of attention spans, a lack of reading at home (they and their parents are on the phone) and the fact that in the age of the smartphon e, reading books is not :-:.een as 'cool'. Wh at is 'cool'? Whatever The System tells th e ma sses is 'cool' and the mas ses impose what The System says is 'cool' on each other through peer pressure. Programmed programmers are everywhere in every race , age group, country and culture . Young adults now spend around 25 percent less time reading than ten years ago. Attention span deletion is crucial and a central g oal of the information assault on the human brain. How can you glean the knowled ge necessary to under s tand the world and the Orv•;ellian conspiracy with an attention ~pan less than that of a goldfish? How can you connect the do ts when you are so bored with the fir st d ot that you reach for the smartphone? Til e Per c eption Deceptio11, my mega expose of the global conspiracy in all its aspects, runs to 900 pages. How many will nev er read this simpl y because their attention span can't cope ? Reading books of that size are actually antidotes for the brain to the s mc1rt manipulation. Social media and text speak - UR prgmd lol wkup B4 2L8 - are also in the frontline of the war against attention spans. Text language is an obvious example of George Orwell 's N1.\"w s peak, the language which replaced the expansive vocabulary of Old s peak and did not have words to describe thoughts and concepts in detail. Political correctne ss is the same agenda. British neuroscienti s t Professor Susan Greenfield , a member of the British House of Lords, published a book in 2014 entitled Mind Change to explore the effects on the brain of the social media / smartphone age. I've read the book and recommend it.

James Olds, a neuroscientist at George Mason University, said: 'The brain has the ability to reprogram iL\"t.>Jf on the fly, altering the way it functions.' Species adapt to d1anging environments by brain and genetic 'placidity' providing new gifts necessary to ~urvive. When this process happens quickly enough we call it 355 Figu~ 620: The hrain 1s being sevt'relv influenc<'<l and changed by the technological r<>~olution. mutation and when it doesn't we call it extinction. Smartphones, Internet and social media haw had fantastic impacts on the brain in a staggeringly short time. Researchers from Tohoku University in Japan concluded that watching television for long periods can also damage brain structure in children. It has long been known that television is a ddictive and takes the brain into an alpha-wave state similar to hypnosis, which opens the subconbcious mind to almost limitless programming. Dr Thomas Mulholland, an American p5ychophysiologist who studied the mind control potential of television, ~id that alpha waves appear after only thirty seconds and the viewer falls into a 'virtual trance'. Smart technology ha,;; now added enormously to this cognitive takeover and the brains of dtildren and ,,dults are being battered by both smartphones and smart televb,ions. This is sobering when you think that the market-re-.earch agency Childwise e stimates that British children spend an average of five hours and 20 minute~ a day in front of 1V or computer screens. Susan Greenfield told the House of Lords: 'It is hard to s ee how living this way on a daily basis will not result in brains, or rather minds, different from those of previous generations.' I would add yes, but that's what they want. She said in a powerful and telling comment: 'The mid-21st century mind might a lmost be infantilised, characteri~ed by s hort attention spans, sensationalism, inability to empathise and a shaky sense of identity.' Once again this is the intention and while the mid-21st century might realise something like completion this process is already well underway. Scan social media for only a short time to see the child-like behaviour of a lleged adults and the gratuitous abuse even of people in tragic circumstances reveals a fundamental lack of empathy (psychopathy). No, not everyone is like that, far from it, but the ratio is high and getting higher from what l can see. Suo;an Greenfield writes: Our brains are under the influence oi an ever-expanding world of new tec:hnology: multichannel television, video games, MP1 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on . .. ... Ele<..troni c devices and pharm.:1ceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro-cellular structure and complex biochemistry oi our brains.

Already, it's pretty clear that the screen-based, two dimensional world that so man, teenagers - and a growing number of adults - choose to inhabit is producing changes in behaviour. Attention spans are shorter, personal communication skills are reduced and there's a marked reduction in the ability to think abstractly. This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as ii something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or You Tube . Altering human identity and perception of self is the whole point of the exercise, and it's interesting that she should highlight the effect on the ability to think abstractly. Definitions of abstract incl u de 'existing in thought or as an idea but not having i'.l physical or concre te existence'; 'dealing with ideas rather than events'; and 'denoting an idea, quality, or state rather than a concrete object'. Thinking in the abstract is primarily the role of the right-brain. You know, the side the Archons want to repress and suppress. Take away abstract thinking and attention spans and you remove the ability to understand the world as it really is and further encase human perception in the five- sense illusion of the Matrix. Researchers at De Montfort University in Leicester reached the same conclusion about the Internet, smartphones and reduced attention spans. They found that the more a person was on the I nternet or phone the more likely they are to experience 'cognitive failures'. A study by neuroscientists and radiologists at universities and hospitals in China noted that young people were becoming 'Internet dependent' and MR1 images revealed that 'excessive Internet use may cause parts of teenagers' brains to waste away'. American technologist Nicholac:; Carr support~ Susan Greenfield's themes in his book, The Sita/lows: How Tlie Internet ls Clzangi11g Tlie Wa .1/ We Think, Read And Remember, and in an article in TJ,e Atlantic magazine headed 'ls Google Making Us Stupid?' Carr spoke out after concluding that something was changing in the way that his brain functioned. 'I've had an uncomfortable sense that someone , or something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neura l-circuitry, reprogramming the memory,' he said. Carr also realised that he wasn't alone when he dbcussed this with other people. A doctor friend told him he had 'almost totally lost the ability to read and absorb a longish article on the web or in print.'

Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, compared the brains of limited users of the Internet with regular users and found that when the fir st group increased their activity their brains took only a few days to change in line with the second group and the changes were permanent. Carr said that 'like a chemical narcotic, the Net's \"cacophony of stimuli\" short-circuits both consciow, and unconscious thoughts, preventing our minds from thinking either deeply or creatively' a nd even sympathetically (deletion of empathy or dehumanisation). Other studies of v ideogame players have shown a r ed uction in the grey matter of the hippocampus which controls memory, learning and emotion, and is associated with neurological and psychological problems like dementia and depression. In the light of this background what an absolutely extraordinary statemen t it was in 2015 when Professor Annette Karmiloff-Smith of the University of London sa.id that babies should be given tablet co mputers 'from birth' (Fig 622). Who said a 'good education' and academic statu~ made you intelligent? Video download Su san Greenfield correctly expresses concern at the effect on personality and perception of violent videogames. These are designed to desensitise players to violence on the basis t hat the brain and subconscious mind doesn't make a distjnction between the 'real' and the simulated. Remember how brain responses were so ~imilar between people thinking about learning to play the piano and those actually learning. Greenfield said: 'That ete rnal teenage protest of \"it's only a game, Mum\" certainly begins to ring alarmingly hollow.' Desensitivity to violence is another form of psychopathy - a lack of empathy with the victims. A poll of Xbox game owners during the 2012 US election revealed that 72 percent supported more drone strikes on 'suspected terrorists' (men, women and children). Suspected, that is, not even proven to be. How many psychopaths play violent video games and war scenarios while still und er the self-delusion that they are just ' normal' people? Susan Greenfield said: 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer- generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' Hedonism is 'the pursuit of or devotion to pleasure, especially to the pleasures of the"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"358 senses' and believing that 'only what is pleasant or has pleasant consequences is intrinsically good.' A big part of the onslaught of cyber information is to stimulate pleasure centres in the brain via what Greenfield calls the 'pleasures of the [five] senses' and manipulate an addiction to pleasure. Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, spoke of making people 'love their serv itude '. A CIA lunatic called Tvor Browning wired a radio receiver to the pleasure centre known as the hypothalamus in the brain of a donkey and controlled the donkey's behaviour by Phantom Sell Figure 623: Control system with Kevin Warwicl... s timulating the pleasure centre when the donkey did what Browning wanted and stopping when it didn't. The d onkey walked along a pre-arranged course and back aga in by seeking to find the direction neet~ssary for the pleasure to return. This is happening step-by-step to humans to make us transhumans or transphantoms. Kevin Warwick, a human microchip-promoting professor of cybernetics at Britain 's University of Reading, said: 'If a machine is passing down signals that keep you completely happy, then why not be part of the Matrix?' 1£ there is a more misguided man than Profe ssor Warwick I would not like to meet him, if it's a!J the same with you (Fig 623). He once said: 'I don't mind changing dramatically from what I am.' Neither do we, Kev, but I won't be holding my breath. There is also pressure for mind-altering lithium to be added to drinking water to make people docile and 's tabilise mood' . A leading advocate, Dr Jacob Appel at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said lithium would make the brain 'more happy' - make people love their serv itude . Appel is from the same hospital as the Rockefelle r 'p rophet' Dr Richard Day. Must be something int.he water. Smart Grid All smart technologies are designed to wirelessly communicate with each other to form the global Smart Grid that would not only keep surveillance on everyone in the multiple ways I will exp lain, but would also feed information, perceptions and instructions to the human mind. Smart televisions, for example, are the Totalitarian Tiptoe (almost complete) to the Telescreens described by Dr Richard Day nearly 50 years ago and by George Orwell nearly 70 years ago in his book 1984: The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long a~ he remained within the field of vision which the metal plate commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time, but at any rate they could plug in vour wire whenever they wanted to."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"1'1n!Om Se lf :k <!Yin ,ersity 1appy, sor :ice 1t I Id e :he form n J years above ined s heard. al wire 11 any Tr.msphantom1sm Samsung S r:;J A RT TV Figure <,24: Ir's because we love you.

Hidden away in the privacy policy that almost no one reads it says 'please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other <;ensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.' So much more is going on with smart televisions (which connect to the lntemet) than we are ever told about (Fig 624). Britain's Daily Mail reported the evidence uncovered by British IT consultant Jason Huntley who became concerned at what appeared to be advertisements on his smart TV home sc reen specifically targeting him and his family based on programmes they had been watching. He connected his laptop to the set to acces s the data passing between the TV and the Internet and he was shocked to find that details of everything he watched and every button he pre~sed un hb remote control were being sent back to corporate headl1uarters in South Korea.

Jerry Day, an electronics and media expert from Burbank, California, has been a vocal and tireless opponent of smart meters after realising the extent to which they maintain surveillance of people in their own homes. Day says that smart meters can: • Identify electrical devices inside the home and record when they are operated to impose an invasion of privacy. • Monitor household activity and occupancy in violation of rights and domestic security. • Transmit wireless signals which may be intercepted by unauthoric;ed and unknown parties. • Record and store data about an occupant's daily habits and activities in permanent databases which are accessed by parties not authorised or invited to know and shar e this private data. • Produce through s mart meter databases a permanent history of household activities complete with calendar and time-of-day to gain a highly invasive and detaill•d view of people's lives. Smart meters are outright smveillance devices in violation of US Federal and State wiretapping laws by recording and storing databases of private information without th e consent or knowledge of tho~e being monitored. They can tell how many people are in a property and where they are and even identify sexual activity.

The European Union is one of the major advocate s of :.mart cities, and when Brus sels bureaucrats open their mouths the Archon hybrids are speaking.

We are told they use digital or information and communication technologies 'to enhance quality a nd performance of urban services, to reduce costs and re so urce consumption , and to eng age more effectively and actively with its citizens.' All of which is a long-winded way of saying 'utter nonsense' . Smart cities are both new cities and the conversion of current cities designed to be terminals on the global Smart Grid controlled by Artificial intelHgence.

The climate lie is so vital to the global plan that if it did not exist (it doesn't) they would have had to invent it (the y have).

The agency developed and furthered much of the conceptual basis for the ARPANET-prototypical communications network launched nearly half a century ago-and invented the digital protocols that gave birth to the Internet. DARPA also provided many of the essential advances that made possible today's computers and communications systems, including seminal technological achievements that support the speech recognition, touch-screen displays, .iccelerometers. and wireless capabilities at the core of today's smartphones and tablets. And Pentagon DARPA which specialises in the development of technology for mass murder did all of this for the benefit of humanity? Bless 'em (Fig 629). DARPA has been the vehicle for taking technology long waiting in the shadows and playing it out in human society in a pre-planned sequence. DARPA, Internet giants and intelligence networks such as the US National Security Agency (NSA) are masks on the same Archontic face. Max Kelly, Chief Security Officer at Facebook, joined the NSA in another inter-departmental appointment. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg says they are building Al systems 'better than humans at our primary senses' and he believes that virtual reality glasses will eventually be part of our every day. We already have virtual reality glasses called 'eyes' but thb is the Archon conspiracy adding yet another layer of illusion and disconnection from prime cont>ciousness. All these corporations and government agencies are speaking the same language, working for the same team and providing an answer to the question 'why are the world's richest people so often the most completely bonkers?' Smart cities or mind control cities of unremitting smveillance involve the concept of the so-called 'Internet of Things' which involves connecting all technology to the Internet, including domestic appliances, to tell the authorities when you even open your fridge door (Fig 630).

Google and Micro so ft have said that the Lnternet of Things would be made possible by free and more powerful Wi-Fi and the Archontic Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed just this - a free wireless internet system for everyone in the United States.

Implantable devices have been waiting in the secret development locations to be introduced at their point in the unfolding process of human control and that moment is here.

The Forbes writer :,aid t hat although this 'might sound like something you'd s ee in a science fiction movie', his prediction was that in the next three to five years 'implantable devices will become about as normal as wearing the latest watch' (which has been the plan all along). A neurosignalling patch is in development that uses low voltage electrical currents to alter a person's mood and energy, the article said, and it highlighted the $300 million in US government funding for technology firms, academic institutions and scientists 'to better under s tand the human mind - and affect it'. Yes, affect it, change it. Re5earching treatments for Alzheimer's, schizophrenia , autism, depression and other health problems is the official sales-pitch and Forbes said that 'implantables can save lives, improve health, prevent diseases and even begin to make us superhuman'. I am not saying that there aren't applications for technology in the fields of spinal injuries for example, but that is not what this is really all about. Nor is it about making people superhuman. The plan is to make them sub-human and mind-slaves to external stimuli. Humans as computer terminals What they call the Smart Grid is a technologically-generated sub-reality within the Schumann cavity that would link all smart and wireless technologies into an electromagnetic Wi-Fi 'cloud' (Fig 634).

One Web proposes to orbit a 'constellation' of nearly 700 satellites' operating in circular low Earth orbits of 800 kilometres (500 miles) and 950 kilometres (590 miles)' to provide global broadband access as early as 2019 (Fig 638). Facebook is, like Google, just another strand in the same Archontic Web, and Facebook is developing its own 'solar- powered drones, satellites and lasers to deliver web access to underdeveloped countries'. Virgin Media, another Richard Branson company, is introducing 'smart pavements' (sidewalks) with Wi-Fi generators under your feet and in street lamps to cover whole towns and cities in Wi-Fi radiation fields. Wow, how amazing. A 'pilot' scheme in the English town of Chesham is planned to be the first step to doing it throughout the country. Martin Parkes, a local business owner and spokesman for The Better Chesham Group, said: It's great that our customers have acc es s to Virgin Media's public Wi-Fi both in and outside our salon.

Transcendence, the 2014 movie starring Johnny Depp, was another cinematic exploration and portrayal of something very reaJ - the potential for the Internet to become a conscious entity. I think it's already happened (Fig 639). Johnny Depp plays a scientist researching consciousness, sentience and artificial intelligence and the aim is to produce a sentient computer that would create a 'technological singularity' or 'Transcendence'. Singularity is a transhumanist term for their world of technology-controlled humans and Transcendence is just another word for transhurnanism. There is even a Singularity University in the NASA Research Park, Silicon Valley, California, with plans to Figure 639: A conscious Internet is the planned foundation oi humi)n control through Artifioal Intelligence. operate globally and 'educate, inspire and empower leaders to apply exponentiaJ technologies to address humanity's grand challenges'. One of its founders is Al super- salesman Ray Kurzweil, of whom more shortly, and one of its sponsors is Google I Alphabet. Kurzweil is a Google executive. The word 'exponential' in that quote is important to emphasise because the speed of development with these AI technologies gets faster and faster as one development increases the speed to the next one. Depp's scientist character knows he's dying and his scientist wife downloads his consciousness to their quantum computer which is then connected to the Internet and the Internet becomes conscious. Connections to the Internet of Things allows his downloaded consciousness to take control of anything Internet-connected and this includes control oi human minds infested with sentient nano-particles spread on the wind. This may have been a fictional story but its theme is based on fact - the Internet can (has) become conscious and self-aware via Artificial Intelligence. Neuroscientist Christof Koch, chief scientific officer at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, has postulated that the Internet might be conscious. He said: The Internet contains about 10 billion computers, with each computer itself having a couple oi billion transistors in its CPU I brain I. So the internet has at least 1 QA 19 transistors, compared to the roughly 1000 trillion (or quadrillion) synapses in the human brain. That's about 10,000 times more transistors than synapses. If the human brain is processing information to become what we call the conscious mind, why wouldn't an Internet of that capacity be able to do the same?

Promotors and apologists for the Al nightmare say that Al is the development of technology that can asses s data, learn, conc.lude and make decisions and yet they claim at the same time that humans will always be in control of this. Mustafa Suleyman from the London-based Al company Deep Mind (bought by Goo gle in 2014) said the idea that a machine-based artificial intelligence could take over decisions and pose a threat to humans was preposterous. No, it's the claim that it's preposterous that's preposterous. I also watched an interview with a 'prominent ro bo ti c engineer', Israel-born Professor Hod Lipson from Cornell University, '\"\"ho was asked about the dangers to humanity of AI robots. His replies were, to put it most optimistically, a head-shaker in sheer naivety. Zionist Ray Kurzweil even has the arrogance to suggest that once humans and the Earth have been given his nanobots treatment then they would expand into space and make the Universe 'wake up' and 'become intelligent'. If he doesn't know the Universe is already intelligent that is shockingly ignorant for a man who thinks he is so clever; but behind the smoke and mirrors and cover stories I'm sure he doe s know.

Herndon said that 'the monsters are poisoning humanity.' Chem trails are a cumulative death sentence on the environment and much of humanity via their role in weather engineering (weather warfare), their toxicity and their hidden and most important content - nanotechnology (Fig 643). Chemtrails pollute people, rivers, lakes, seas, land, plants and forests as the Earth and its population are targeted by the Death Cult to change our reality into Archon reality. Trees and plant life are dying from the very toxins found in chemtrails (Fig 644). Once soil and water is contaminated everything gets it. Aluminium and barium levels have been increasing in water and soil all over the world, with snow on Mount Shasta in Northern Phantom Se ll Figure 643: For the good of humanitv? California recording an astonishing rise from :,,even parts per billion to 61,000 parts per billion. People under chemtraiJ bombardment report respiratory and flu-like illness, mental confusion and depression. Barium is known to weaken muscles, including heart muscles, and the immune system; thorium is a known cause of cancer and leukaemia; and aluminium is linked to osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and damage to the immune system (again). Research at Britain's Bournemouth University published in th e journal Surgical Neurology l11ternatio11al reveals a dramatic increase in brain disea ses . They compared figures between 1989 and 2010 in 21 Western countries and found that the average onset of dementia sta rted ten years earlier in 2010 than in 1989. Deaths from neurologicaJ disease in older people had soared and ever younger people were being affected. Diseases had reached 'almost epidemic' levels and the report suggested that environmental factors were largely to blame. Lead researcher Colin Pritchard said: 'Th e rate of increase in such a short time suggests a silent or even a \"hidden\" epidemic, in which environmental factors must play a major part, not just ageing.'

Aluminium is also in vaccines. Dr Russell Blaylock, an American neurosurgeon and expert in neurotoxins, is convinced (as I have 373 been for a long time) that chemtrails are a delivery system for nanotechnology. He says nanoparticles of aluminium in chemtrails correspond with an increase in brain degeneration diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and he says they quickly enter the brain after people breathe them in. Nanoparticles are the real cause of the 'mystery' Morgellons disease which appeared in the same period that the chemtrails began. Morgellons involves coloured fibres growing inside the body which can be pulled out through the skin only to be r eplaced by others as they replicate (Fig 645). The s ame applies to the environment in general which is being constantly bathed in nanoparticles and toxins from the sky. We are in the realms of synthetic biology impacting upon and controlling 'natural' biology through multiple sources (the bad copy being further and further inverted). Synthetic= 'made by chemical synthesis, especially to imitate a natural product' . Big Pharma and Big Biotech-controlled government agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration and European Food Agency block promotion and use of nutrition from nature and yet wave through synthetic versions of the same thing. This is also connected to the agenda to create synthetic humans and a synthetic world. Mass die-offs of trees and plant life from chemtrail chemicals and other content (problem) provide the excu se to replace them with genetically-modified versions resistant to toxins (solution). 'Trials' of toxin- resistant/ aluminium-resistant GMO trees, crops and plants are already happening. Frontline transhumanist promotor Ray Kurzweil Sdid: 'Nanobots will infuse all the matter around us with information. Rocks, trees, everything will become these intelligent creatures.' What he is describing there is known as 'programmable matter'. Remember 'black goo and programmable matter'? At least one Morgellons sufferer has had black goo of the classic movie variety come out of their body. Another term for nanobots is 'smart dust' which was pump-primed by the infamous DARPA. Each micro- computer ca.n communicate with all the rest to change anything including the human body because it manipulates programmable matter. Smart dust is the Demiurge/ Archon virus. What is the major delivery system through which Kurzweil's nanobots are being distributed to 'infuse all matter'? Chemtrails.

Research by scitmtist Clifford E. Carn.icom of the Camicom lnstitute in New Mexico found 'red blood cells, white blood cells, and unidentified cell types' within 'sub-micron tibre samples'.

A Borg-like hive-mind would be dramatically more extreme and technologically driven. Archons are akin to the Borg as slaves and expressions of the Demiurge virus and they are attempting to assimilate humans into the same 'collective'. Here is a description of the Borg.

This is bad for human health and well-being, increases the power and effectiveness of radio waves and other communications manipulating the human mind and emotions, and empowers still further the technological sub-reality perception 'bubble'. Weather manipulation through HAARP-type technology also becomes even more effective. If you control the nature of the sea, you affect all the fish - and if you control the frequency and information nat u re of the energy se,1 you affect all the human 'fish' (Fig 655). Dr Robert Beck, an expert in nuclear engineering, co-authored a scientific research paper nearly 40 ago with Dr Michael A. Persinger of Laurentian University in Canada, an expert in Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) radiation, which explored the potential for mind control through electromagnetic fieJds . Many levels of the human hologram and auric fields are electromagnetic in nature. Dr Beck told a Psychotronics Association conference in 1979 that people exposed to certain ELF field patterns experienced sensation~ of uneasiness, depression and foreboding. Dr Andrija Puharich, an American medical and parapsychological researcher, showed s ome 60 years ago how the use of frequencies can manipulate mood and behaviour and obviously the more powerfully this can be delivered the bigger the effect. He found that 10.80 Hz triggered 'riotous behaviour' and 6.6 Hz made people depressed. Psychics in 'out there' -mode operated at 8 H z. Frequency warfare is used by the military to manipulate mood and perceptions of enemy troops, and have no doubt this is used against civilian protestors, too. Broadcasting the frequency to stimulate the desired effect can produce riots, depression, whatever response you want.

We have even had advertisement 'trials' on German trains in which messages are beamed into the minds of passengers when they lean their head against the window. The Soviet Union broadcast perception-manipulation frequencies and information into the United States in the 1970s through the ' Woodpecker' signal named after its repetitive tapping sound. American Lieutenant Colonel John B. Alexander wrote in Military Ret•iew that they were well aware that Soviet 'mind-altering techniques' were ad,·anced and included 'manipulation of human behaviour through the use of psychological weapons affecting sight, sound, smell, temperature, electromagnetic energy, or sensory deprivation'. He said that certain low-frequency (ELF) emissions po ssess psychoactive characteristics which could be used 'to induce depression or irritability in a target population'. Alexander said that large-scale ELF behaviour modification could have an horrendous impact (HAARP technology can operate in this band). Missing from his commenb wa s that the United States and other countries could do the s ame as the Soviet Union and that in the end all those 'separate' sources of electromagnetic mass mind and emotion control answered to the same Archontic Web. A United States Patent from April, ]976 involved 'apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brain waves' and explained how brain activity could be manipulated and monitored from a distance using electromagnetic fields. The summary said: ... high frequency transmitters are operated to radiate electromagnetic energy of different frequencies through antennas which are capable oi scanning the entire brain of the test subject or any desired region thereof. The signals of different frequencies penetrat e the skull oi the subject and impinge upon the brain where they mix to yield an interference wave modulated by radiations from the brain's natural electrical activity. No, thi s is not a conspiracy 'theory'. Dr Robert Beck told the Psychotronics Association conference in 1979 that the Woodpecker signals were being broadcast into American homes through electrical systems.

Two things immediately come from this: firstly he is describing what was happening 40 years ago and the technology is light-years more effective today; and secondly this was being done via an electrical system that was not built for this purpose. The Smart Grid is being built precisely for this purpose and thi s is the rea s on for the otherwise insane imposition by law of ' green' light bulbs, which are designed not primarily to provide light but a~ transmitters of information for the Smart Grid (Fig 656).

Barrie Trower, a retired British military intelligence scientist, has long experience in microwave warfare~nd has been widely quoted on the dangers of the TETRA system. He explained why microwave frequencies were employed for cell phones and today's mass communication networks : During the 1950s and 1960s during the Cold War, it was realised by accident that microwaves could be used as stealth weapons when the Russians beamed the American embassy during the Cold War and it gave everybody working in the embassy cancer, breast cancers, leukaemia whatever, and it was realised then that low level microwaves were the perfect stealth weapon to be usro on dissident groups around the world, because you could make dissident groups sick , give them cancer, change their mental outlook on life without them even knowing they were being radiated. The electromagnetic spectrum is a band that goes from gamma rays and x-rays at one end, th e very high energy waves, and it comes down through visible light. which is also some radiation , and then it goes through infrared microwaves, TV and radio. Now the only ones which really affect us in the communications industry are the microwaves, and microwaves have a specia l ability to interfere with water, which is how microwave ovens work, and we are made of wate r. All of our chemical and electrical signals involve water in the body, somehow. electrical communications in the body. So, the industry has picked the worst possible part of the electromagnetic spectrum to give to young children and to adults. The Hidden Hand made this decision because the effects described by Barry Trower and many more are vvhat they want to happen. Microwaves can penetrate bone, walls ,md people and hence we have microwave Wi-Fi. We live in a raging sea of microwaves today when Trower says that he w,11:, told during his time in the military that there was no safe level of microwaves (Fig 659). How could there be when Wi-Fi radiation is interacting with the human auric radiation field from which the body is made manifest ? Trower says microwave ovens can change the nature of proteins in the food they zap and yet of the 100,000 different proteins in the body he says 'we only know about 600 ' and ~o have no idea about the effect of microwave-mutating proteins. But the Hidden Hand does . Look how mud1 food is cooked in this way in homes, cafes and restaurants . Trower abo makes the point that low level microwaves can be even worse than high level because of a mechanism in the body that defends against their effect. He says that this defence mechanism is activated by high level microwaves while at low level they c-an get 'under the radar'. Trower warns that the smaller you are the more you are affected and that of course brings u~ to children who also have thinner skulls protecting the brain. Smartphone for your child, anyone?

Trower says there is no published paper anywhere in the world giving a safe limit for a child to be subjected to microwaves for a simple reason - there is no safe limit. He reveals that documents in his possession, not made public for obvious reasons, list brain tumours on the front and s ide of the head as the biggest cauM.' of death in children in the UK. He also quotes university researchers, government scientists and international sck•ntific advisors, as predicting a minimum of 57.7% of schoolgirls exposed to low-level microwave radiation (Wi-Fi) risk foetal abnormalities and giving birth to still-born, genetically damaged children with the genetic damage passing to the next generation. Now , for anyone who doubts the plan for a colossal cull of the global population here is a devastating point made by Barrie Trower: If nothing is done about Wi-Fi, sm.ut meters etc., then in the lHetime of one person - 60 year!'> - the number of healthy children will be one-eighth - one fucking t'iglith - of what it is now.

Trow er said that he knew of at least 59 scientific papers linking microwaves to breast cancer s. He challenges anyone to show him a police station, fire station or other emergency service anywhere in the world that has had TETRA for 18 months and he will 'absolutely guarantee' that the level of violence by the police, breast cancer and other cancers, sickness, miscarriages and stilJ-births will all have gone up .

He told the excellent and recommended Richie Allen radio show on Davidicke.com that he has a United State s document from 1976 which states that the public and military /law enforcement 'mu st be deceived' about the full potential damage of microwaves to 'protect industrial output' and avoid legal actions. He quotes the frequencies agreed in official documen ts to manipulate mood and health including paranoia, depression/suicide, manic behaviour I anger, and blindness (aimed at the head) and heart attack (aimed at the chest). US Department of Defense documents list hypertension, changes in blood stat e, headache, fatigue, menstrual disorders, depression, anxiety and many ailments previously li s ted. One says that 'personnel exposed to microwave radicltion below thermal levels experience more neurological, cardio-vascular and haemodynamk disturbances than do their unexposed counterparts'. Haemodynamic relates to blood tlow within organ s and tissue. Trower says that his experience in the Royal Navy, which involved questioning spies, made him realise the even more devastating effect of pulsing frequencies added to microwaves. These can seize the heart and brain and ca use hundreds of health and emotional problems and changes in behaviour that the victim s would not associate with the real cause. Smartphones, smart meters, Wi-Fi, etc., all operate with pulsing frequencies. Much has been said about the way cell phones heat the brain and that's bad enough, but the pulsing aspect is even wor se (Fig 663). Trow er s aid the authorities knew of some 600 different pulsing frequencies for such uses with more being added all the time. This radiation madne ss has been de scribed as an experiment with life itself, but to those driving the insanity it's no experiment. They know what the outcome is planned to be because they have done the s ame to other societies and realities many times before.

I have explained in Remember Who You Are and Tire Perception Deceptio11 why the nuclear catastrophe at Fukushima in Japan in 2011 was no accident and the scale of radiation that this has released into the atmosphere and Pacific Ocean - and is still releasing - is truly astonishing (Fig 665) . One researcher specialising in the consequences of Fukushima said: 'The Pacific is in terminal decline. The Fukushima legacy is terrifying.' The unfolding effect on all forms of life is equally horrific with studies finding thyroid cancer rates among children in the Fukushima region 50 times higher than the general population. National Geo g raplri c reported on a sudden and 'bewildering' die-off in the Pacific: In March 2012, less than one percent of the seafloor heneath Station M was covered in dead sea salps. By July 1, more than YB percent of it was covered in the decomposing organisms, according to the study, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The major increase in activity of deep-sea life in 2011 and 2012 weren't limited to Station M ... ... Even though they do not have a 'scientific explanation' ior what is happening, the scientists are admitting that they have never seen a die-off of this magnitude in the 24 years that this study has been going on ... They could never use the politically incorrect 'f' word - Fukushima. The public mu s t not be allowed to make a connection between cause and effect or the future radiation plans of the agenda could come under scrutiny. When radiation levels in water, food an d air breach previous 'safe limits' (they weren't) the authorities simply increase the le vels they tell the public are officially safe. Oh, yes, officiall_11. All that means is the 'safe' limit the agenda requires to safely (legally) continue with its mayhem. R ule by robot s The Smart Grid/transhumanh:.t conspiracy and the radiation thii, requires and generates are designed to achieve the following among many other goals: • Attach human minds technologically to the Smart Grid through genetic manipulation, entrainment and 'implantables' to control thought, emotion and"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"386 perception and prevent anyone from accessing awareness beyond the Matrix. • Change the frequency and atmosphere to make it conducive to the Archons and their agents in form. • Destroy human health as part of the cull and mutate a new slave species that can live in a highly irradiated environment as they are doing with trees, plants etc. This is all planned to be over!>een and controlled not only by smart and associated Al technologies but by robots which in the end look so like humans it will be difficult to tell them apart: The ultimate 'singularity' of turning robots into humans and humans into robots. Our world is being transformed by robots of multiple types. Society-changing numbers of jobs are going to be lost to them in coming years and it's already begun (Fig 666); but this is about more than lost employment.

Taking over your home, more like. Researchers from the Royal Melbourne lnstitute of Technology said they have created a device 10,000 time::. thinner than a human hair, which is a 'vital step towards creating a bionic brain', and we are told th at 'the best minds' are working towards a truly sentient digital brain. Russian scientis ts at Tomsk State University in Western Siberia s ay they have created a model of a brain that is able to educate itself and 'could be an artificial carrier of a natural mind, able to learn and react to the environment'. Robots are predicted to have self-awareness and emotions, and bioengineers at Harv Md University have created the first examples of cyborg tissue - 'neurons, heart cells, muscle, and blood vessels that are interwoven by nanowires and transistors' that allow a computer to interface directly with the cells. Th is is what nanotechnology in chem trails is doing to humans to turn them into robots. We have reached the point where one legal expert has called for laws to regulate robots in case they 'wake up' and demand rights, and also because of their potentially lethal capabilities (Fig 667).

A survey of 12,000 users of a digital assistant app similar to Siri found t hat almost half could imagine falling in love with their virtual assistant. Ryan Calo asks - what if a machine claims the right to make copies of itself (the only way it knows to replicate)? But how do you regulate something that is planned to regulate everything? This is the point that is missed by those warning against the consequences of ArtificiaJ Intelligence. Scientist Stephen Hawking has said that without AI safeguards humanity could be heading for a dark future and even the demise of our species (Fig 668). Computer scientist Professor Stuart Russell told the journal Science that artificial intelligence could be as dangerous as nuclear weapons or even worse with Al's 'bewildering variety of software that we cannot yet describe'. These are valid points but still the crux of the matter is missing. Those in the shadows (and many who are not) promoting and driving Al and transhumanism intend to have Artificial Intelligence take over humanity and certainly not be subordinate to human laws, regulations and constraints. Robot Army Whilt' such warnings are being delivered the Pentagon's DARPA, in cahoots with Google/ Alphabet, push on ,,vith the robot explosion and the creation of robot armies. DARPA is funding a Robotics Grand Challenge which claims to be seeking to improve responses to disasters and rescues, when t he real motivation is the military and control Figure 669: Hey, troops of today - these will be chasing you and vour families when they 've raken over and you have realiSC'd you've heen hoaxed . applications. Positive us es for robotics are only the co\\'er story to hide the truth of where this is meant to lead. Google bought robotics company Boston Dynamics in 2013 along with its DARPA contracts to develop robots for military purposes. The world army I police force that I de cribed earlier is eventually planned to be an army of Al robots (currently called 'autonomous weapons') controllt'd by Al 'generals' and police personnel (Fig 669). Human troops and those now using transhumanist 'Transformer' - type technologies are just the stepping"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"388 stone to the robot army and they had better realise this fact and quick. The whole Transformer movie theme along with videogames is preparing people for the AI-controlled transhumanist society and making it 'sexy' (Fig 670). 'Fighting for my country' is just another Archontic scam to exploit human troops to impose the wiU of the Hidden Hand until they, too, become surplus to requirements. Busiuess Finance Ne1vs (BFN) reported in 2015 that Pentagon agency DARPA is heavily funding a project to 'enhance human ability in Phant om Self Figure &70: On the way to iull~·-tledged technologica l control. war zones, by altering the genetic code of their soldiers'. They hope to achieve supremacy by making soldiers who are stronger, smarter, more focused and lack empathy. Here we go again. DARPA refers to the human genetic code as the 'recipe'. The BFN report said: The part of the brain that is responsible for empathy can be turned off by gene therapy, mak ing the soldiers oblivious to fear, fatigue and emotions. What makes this thought even more terrifying is the 'Human Assisted Neural Devices program' which focuses on controlling th e brain. The result is the next generation of biological war 'machines', which could be controll ed by a sophisticated 'joystick'. Turnjng troops into robots. 'Biological war machines'= biological computers with no consciousness as we would perceive it. Trus is a stepping stone to a fully Al military . A US Navy website in 2015 ran the headline 'Navy to Accelerate Artificial Intelligence Development for Warfighting, Support Roles'. The article said: 'The Navy wants to integrate robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) into more of its workload, from warfighting missions to non-combat support roles, and is seeking fleet input on what types of AI research are worth investing in.' This is happening in all parts of the milit a ry and across the world as the global robot army controlled by Archon AI takes shape ( Fig 671). 'Matrix Sentinels, atten-s/11m.' Stephen Hawking and thousands of other scientists have warned about a robot arm s race in which technological ki!Jers will be so cheap to build and be the 'Kalashnikovs of tomorrow'. They warned of terrorists and warlords perpetrating ethnic cleansing, assassinations, destabilising nations, subduing populations and killing ethnic groups. This is possible until the complete takeover but it would be far more pertinent to make this warning Figure &71: This is the penny that needs to drop."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"intom Se lf al '.

This is where it is really coming from and whose ends it is planned to se~e. Once again DARPA, one of the world's most sinister organisations, has been driving transhumanism and artificial intelligence as it brags on its own website: DARPA has also long been a leader in the development of artificial intelligence, machine intelligence and semi-autonomous systems. DARPA's efforts in this domain have focused primarily on military operations, including command and control, but the commercial sector has adopted and expanded upon many of the agency's results to develop wide-spread applications in fields as diverse as manufacturing, entertainment and education. Yes, just as they were meant to. DARPA is also the force behind the development of synthetic genetics and DNA which is a foundation pillar of the Archon transhumanist society. The Wasl1i11gto11 Post reported: In the public sector, the role of innovation giant DARPA in funding synthetic biology projects has exploded, eclipsing the role of other prominent U.S. government agencies that fund synthetic biology programs. such as the National Science Found ation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the USDA. In 2014 alone, DARPA funded $100 million in programs, more than three times the amount funded by the NSF, marking a fast ramp-up from a level of zero in 2010. If DARPA, an am, of the Pentagon (arm of the Archons), is involved in anything then it is always real bad for humanity. Pill pushers One other point needs mentioning in this chapter. 'Smart pills' are a forerunner to the population being pennanently drugged. A dystopian movie called Equilibrium released in 2003 featured a storyline in which both the masses and police state personnel were forced to take mind-suppressing drugs every day and they were technologically monitored to ensure they did so . Today we have headlines like 'Smart Pill Contains Microchip to Monitor Patient Medication' and 'Smart pill with edible microchip that tells you and your doctor when the next dose is due'. Patients take their pills with a Figure &72: Sm.ut pills for Smart Grid minds. sensor that sends information to a receiver patch worn on the shoulder or a.rm. This data is then communicated to a mobile device, smartphone or tablet, to tell the patient or doctor when the next dose is due (Fig 672). Technological capability for enforced drug-taking portrayed in Equilibrium is already here and it is planned to be monitored eventually by Artificial Intelligence. Mandatory vaccinations are a stepping - stone to this goal. The young are most aggressively targeted and here is a"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"390 Phantom Sft f headline that highlights the point: 'Watchdog Says Report of 10,000 Toddlers on ADHD Drugs Tip of the Iceberg- 274,000 0-1 Year Olds and 370,000 Toddlers J9rescribed Psychiatric Drugs'. Pauses for breath. The US Centers for Disease Control admit that ten thousand toddlers are being given mind-changing drugs for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which is a make-believe 'disease' concocted by taking a series of childhood behaviours and giving them a name. lt was done to justify the mas s drugging of the still-developing minds of chiJdren to change them for the rest of their lives. This is outrageous enough, but the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a mental health watchdog, says that data provided by IMS Health, the world's leading health information and analytics company, shows that the situation is seriously more extreme. It says that hundreds of thousands of toddlers are being prescribed far more powerful psychiatric drugs with many given them before their first birthday. By the time they reach the age of five the number is more than a million and this leaps to more than four million for children between six and twelve. American psychiatrist and mental health reformer Allen Frances said: There are no objective tests in psychiatry - no X-ray, laboratory or ex am finding that says definitively that someone does or does not have a mental disorder. There is no definition of mental disorder. It's bull ... I mean you just can't define it. The mass drugging of children from birth is being done systematically on the road to compulsory psychiatric medication to control the perceptions of the population. The National Institutes of Health list serious side-effects (effects) of these drugs as agitation , mania, aggressive or hostile behaviour, seizures, hallucinations, and sudden death. But the Archons and their hybrids don't care - the agenda is all that matters. Vaccinations are an obvious access point for drugs, toxins and nanochips I nanobots and this is another reason for the gathering campaign to make them compulsory. Researchers at the University of California-San Diego announced in 2015 the development of 'microfish' - 'smart' mic.robots to travel through the bloodstream delivering drugs to specific parts of the body. There is also a smartphone-connected system that can detect changes in a person 's mood and behaviour patterns and transmit this information to ' professionals' in real time (Fig 673); but even that's not enough for these maniacs . Scientists at Taiwan University are creating sensors to be implanted in teeth to transmit information to doctors via 13Juetooth (how apt) with information about talking and chewing. How have we ever coped before? Once again insider Zbigniew ~ Brzezinski predicted it all. He wrote in 1970: Speaking of a future at most only decades away, an experimenter in intelligence control asserted, 'I foresee a time when we shall have the means and therefore, inevitably, the temptation to manipulate the behaviour and intellectual functioning of the people Figure 673: Hey, cool, man."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"t Transphantomlsm J91 through environmental and biochemical manipulation of the brain.

'It can't be that simple, Dave.' Oh, but it can and it is. The world seems so complex and yet it isn't. Apparent complexity is the playing out of what is at its core very simple: What you believe you perceive and what you perceive you experience.

How is that any different from the basic dynamic of war? Legal attacks have ended in my favour, but took an enormous amount of money to defend against, which I have never recovered. Thjs is another common theme of war - nobody wins. ' Victory' i!> counted by the scale of los s, not gain. I heard a quote one time that said something like 'when you go to war you have already lost'. This is so true. How many soldiers from 'victorious' armie s have been mentally, emotionally and 'physically' deva s tated by what they did and saw? History s ees 'winners', but I se e losers every time. The point I am making is that just as war happens on multiple levels and in multiple ways so do other ex periences that appear to be different , but are expressions of the sa me one . Nuclear weapons, host i le takeovers, legal attacks, a war of words. It is only matter of scale. In the end it comes down to two states of perception: fear and love. Everything is one or the other (Fig 67 8) . War is fear made manifest and so is competition. Peace in its tru e s ense (not just the absence of war) is love made manifest and so is cooperation. Worry, anxiety, stres s, regret, aggression, hatred, hostility, arrogance, disharmony , greed and lies are all fear made manifest. Joy, kindness, empathy, compassion , generosity and pursuit of truth a re all love made manifest. Whid1 one prevails? That's our choice and we are making it every 'minute' of every 'day' . Which wolf wins?-as a Native American saying puts it (Fig 679). This is the choice that determines the world we live 'in'. Fear infests the perceptions of everyone to a greater or lesser degree and in most the degree is ma ss iv e although they may not realise it. Fear has many labels to disguise its presence, but th e man behind the mask is s till the man. Fear is the ard,itect of control.

Self-identity with ln6nite Awareness disconnects you from being affected by what other people say or think about you. What would have h u rt before is n ow laughed away if there is any reaction at all. I have undergone monumental abuse and still do, but the abusers are wasting their lives if they think it impacts upon me (fig 688). If you were abused by someone who had no idea who they are or even why they are saying what they do would you take offence? Of course not. You would say poor chap or poor lady, how sad . It's not what people say that affects you but your response to what they say. If you think it matters then it will in terms of how it makes you feel. If you know it doesn't matter because it's all an illusion then the effect on you is zero (Fig 689). Why should we care what s omeone says about us when their in t ent is to hurt and harm? They deserve our sympathy, not our outrage. They have to wake up tomorrow and remember they are still them which can't be easy. Those that abuse you are expressions of the same Infinit e Awareness that you are. The only difference is that you have remembered you are Infini te Awareness having an experience and they s till believe they are the experience. Intent is also crucial to speeding your awakening. I said earlier how powerful is the energy of intent in manife s ti ng what you want. You a re the Infinite and the Infinite is you. Intent is a way of interacting with the greater 'you' to bring your desire into holographic reality; but here is where many New Age guru-types miss the point. One chap suggested that people should stick pictures of Ferraris all over the place to help them to visualise one into their life. Qujte apart from the foct that anyone who wants to spiritually manifest a Ferrari is still owned by the program, there are other forces at work which I will explain. Humanity's obsession with the accumulation of money and possessions is the program talking and if that's your only goal Infinite Awareness will not be involved. Mor e than one 'you ' Everyone and everything is an expression of the same Lnfinite reality, but if we bring it down to the ' incarnate' human there is more than one 'you' (Fig 690). There shouldn ' t be, but it's the way things are in the madhouse. There is conscious 'you'; subconsciow, 'you'; and superconscious 'you'.

Subliminal advertising implants images and perceptions in the subconscious mind for the s ame reason. Superconsciousness is what the Archons are desperate to suppress, and the overwhelming majority live their lives in their conscious and subcorn,cious minds - different levels of the s ame mind in fact and what l refer to as Phantom Self. Thjs is the realm of 'I want a Ferrari', 'I want to be super rich', 'I want power and status' and all the rest. It is also the realm of those who encourage people to 'think' themselves a Ferrari.

As I was told through Betty Shine right at the start: 'The spiritual way is tough and no one makes it easy.' What often happens is your old life starts to unravel and great change can be triggered, not all of it what you would like. But hold on. You said you wanted to awaken to your tme self and that can't happen if the 'old' life is not serving that intent. Once Body-Mind is breached by superconsciousness, and especially when the floodgates open as they did with me after Peru, you can wave goodbye to what was before. Influence of superconsciousness and the energy matrix created by your intent draws to you through 'vibrational magnetism' the experiences, people, locations and information necessary to dismantle Phantom Self, expose the illusion and allow the superconscious you to express its wisdom and insight amid the madness. We are living an illusion but we can experience these change s at first as if it were all real. Superconsciousness can see the illusion and has a totally different perspective of the s ame experience. To the conscious 'you' something can seem like a disaster, your wor<;t nightmare, while to superconsciousness the s ame experience is a great gift that further dismantles the perception and fear construct of Phantom Self (Fig 691) .

To do what I have done for the last 26 years, write what I have and say what l have, I had to be free of caring what other people thought of me - even the national media and its onslaught of ridicule and abuse. This is so important, vital, crucial, essential. indispensable bottom-line. Anyone who wants to ,1waken from the program and ditch Phantom Self must let go of the fear of what other people think. Almost everyone is editing their views, opinion:, and lifestyles to avoid being ridiculed, condemned or criticised, and so they are not living their own lives and their own uniqueness, but someone else 's version of what they should be, do and think. Phantom Selves policing Phantom Selves, sheep controUing sheep, is how we got where we are. You don't change a situation by doing what created it. What does it matter what others think of you? They will think something else tomorrow (Fig 692). What you are is none of their business and Mark Twain was so right when he said: 'Never argue with stupid people. They will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience .' Who are they to tell you who you are and what perceptions you should have? You don't have to justify yourself and de.fend yourself - just l,e yourself. l can tell you from long and extreme experience that you ca11 be yourself and not what the crowd tells you to be to mirror their own programming (Fig 693). I could not have done what I have unle-.s this foundation of human control was deleted.

I wanted to be a professional football player and the doors of 'coincidence' opened to make that happen - for a short while.

I hid what wa!> happening and kept going as long as I could before I had to stop playing at the age of 21. Arthritis for a budding footballer (nightmare) became a vehicle for awakening unbreakable determination and a refusal of to go under that l never kne\\.,, I had (gift). I have had many people come into my life who have proved to be deeply unpleasant frauds and parasite.'>, and had many legal ca...,es to fend off.

You have awakened another notch from the Phantom to sync even more powerfully with your superconsciousness. Our thoughts, emotions, attitud es and perceptions are all frequencies and electromagnetic phenomena, and they attract via vibrational magnetism other frequencies and electromagnetic field s - people, place s, jobs, experiences. You only have to look at the work with water of Dr Masaru Emoto .tnd the Aerospace Institute in Stuttgart to see how humans impact on energetic fields. I saw a quote on the Internet which said:' Accidents happen, that's what everyone says, but in a quantum universe there are no such things as accidents, only possibilities and probabilities folded into existence by perception.' Exactly . What we believe we perceive and what we perceive we experience. What we put out we get back is another way of saying the same thing and this is the foundation of what is called 'karma'. When superconsciousness comes into play its influence attracts to you mor e and more the people, places, jobs, experiences, which give you the best possible chance to complete what you are here to do. This is not 'karma' but 'guidance'. So many 'bad' things that have happened to me over 64 years right back into childhood have been essential pr e paration for what [ am doing now. My life and my work are indivisible because my own scale of awakening decides th e quality of the work. I remember as a little kid in primary school playing a tree (yes, a tree) in the annual play. All the parents and teachers were watching as Prince Charmin g (teacher's pet) came through our 'forest' with an imaginary scythe to cut us dov.rn to reach Sleeping Beauty. I was standing there in my brown top and trousers with make- believe foliage on my head waiting for him to come over to me so I could fall do\\-\\'TI; but he never did. The others dropped to the floor even though in my mind that was silly because he couldn't cut them down from so far away. l remained standing and Prince Charming never came. The audience began to titter, then giggle and finally laugh out loud. I stood there bewildered at why I was being laughed at when l wa s only playing it for real. Next day the headmistress, Miss Wilkinson, a very large lady in her tweed sui t and with shoulders the envy of quarterbacks, called me out of class and stood over me like s ome fairy tale ogre telling me how I had let the school down. I can still remember the experience so dearly because of the impact it had upon me. Last one standing and refusing to fall has its own symbolism with relation to my later life but more relevant than that was facing public ridicule at such a very young age. I couldn't have been mo re than six or seven. This was non-conscious preparation decades earlier for what I faced in mas s public ridicule after 1991. It may have been very different in scale, but the experience was the same. I have no doubt that what had such an impact on me at age six or s even opened something in my psyche that made it easier to come through wha t I have as an adult. Life is not a series of unconnected random events and our choice is to have those events manifested by superconsciousness or Phantom Self. li we don't learn from them, grow from them, awaken from them and see them as the gifts that they are they can add still more layers to Phantom Self in resentment, regret, suppressed and un s uppre ss ed anger and a sense that 'the world's against me'.

Thought Control Superconsciousness is the observer and guide when \"ve open ourselves to its influence. It is the realm of k11owi11g. Body-Mind is the experiencer in the realm of thought. Phantom Self is a construct of emotion and thought made manifest through the conscious and subconscious mind. Thought is the god of The System because it :.erves the interests of the Archontic conspiracy. We talk about a 'great thinker' and 'great mind', but thought is the village idiot compared with knowing. Superconsciousness is the knower for it is in conscious co1mection to the All Knowing, All That ls in awareness of itself. People can become ,;o detached from their superconsciousness that when their awarene ss leaves the body they are still operating in what we call conscious and subconscious mind. Such people are often referred to as 'lost souls' and they are very common given the power of the program to dktate perception s even after 'death'. These were the symbolic people in my ayahuasca experience dropping from the sky and back into the same 'groove' they had trodden many times before. If you sit quietly you can observe your thoughts passing through yom mind. Don't try to influence them. Let them be and observe. This can be hilarious when you witness the nonsensical mind chatter and what Phantom Self waffles on about.

But here's the point: As you observe this proce ss who i doing the thinking? Phantom Self. Who is doing the observing? Superconscious self. YOU. fnfinite YOU. The System is specifically designed to entrap us in thought. 'Education' is about thinking and so is science, medicine, business, politics, all of it.

I'll elaborate in a moment. On one level the heart can be seen as an electrical pump delivering blood flow (energy I information) to aU parts of the hologram. Arteries a.nd veins are holographic expressions of the information or 'chi' circulating the meridian system, which is the basis of acupuncture. Meridians are connected with the chakra vortexes that I described earlier (Fig 144). Lower chak.ras relate to this 'world', higher ones to other realities, and the balance-point vortex at the centre is the heart chak.ra. We experience feelings of love in the centre of the chest (my heart 'fluttered') because the heart chak.ra is our connection to Infinite Love - Infinite Self and superconsciousness. When the heart chakra is open and allowing free expression to Infinite Self then Infinite Love is also Infinite Awareness, InfinHe Intelligence, Infinite Knowing or superconsciousness (Fig 699). The head thinks, but the heart knows. Infinite Awareness is Infinite Awareness - a state of being Infinitely Aware. The more superconsciousness that we access the more we infinitely know. Not think. Not try to work out. KNOW. It's the All-Knowing, not the All-Thinking. Thought is Phantom Self. Knowing is Infinite Self. People experience this in the difference between thought and intuition and you hear terms like 'go with your head' or 'go with your heart'. Body language is the head thinking or the heart feeling ... Phantom Self thinking or Infinite Self knowing. We don't put our hands on our heart or chest and say 'I'm thinking'. We put them to our head where the brain is thinking. We put our hands to our chest when we have intuitive insight or feelings and we say 'I just know in my heart'. People even talk of their 'heart of hearts'. Knowing from the heart is something that I have been guided to understand (remember) since I left Betty Shine's front room. Si.nee that day whenever my heart has been in conflict with my head I have gone with my heart, my intuitive knowing, and eventually there is no conflict. Heart and head begin to speak the same language - as they are meant to. The late and very great American comedian Bill Hicks was a very aware man .

A world where greed is our god and wisdom is a sin, where division is key and unity is fantasy, where ego-driven cleverness of th e mind is praised, rather than the intelligence of the heart. Research at the Institute of HeartMath revealed that when the energetic field oE the heart is in harmony and electromagnetic coherence (communication) with the bra in and the central nervous system we enter a far more expanded state of awareness. New data suggested that 'the heart's field is directly involYed in intuitive perception, through its coupling to an energetic information field outside the bounds of time and space '. Yes- superconsciousness (Fig 700). Archontic inversion has sought to destroy this coheren ce and connection, suppress the heart chakra and make the brain centre of attention in every sense. E\\'erything is meant to work in unison to reflect the unity of Infinite Existence, but instead the 'parts' that make the whole have been systematically fragmented. Heart is de-Jinked from head. Right-brain is delinked from left-brain . Humanity needs to literally pull itself together (Fig 701 ). In s tead of open heart-wh ole brain unity we have in most people left-brain isolation. The difference is almost b eyond description.

Pre-hijack humanity interacted with reality through the heart and the brain wa s there to respond to heart 'knowing'. Once that connection wa s distorted and blocked, thought and emotion became the governor of perception, response and behaviour (Fig 703). A heart world became the head world that we have had ever since. People talk of having a heart-to- heart and this de s cribes a sparkling trnth in that we c an communicate heart-to-heart without intervention from the brain (Fig 704). If we did, conflict would end immediately. Deep sadness is described in term s of being 'heartbroken' or having 'heartache' and thi s is the effect on the heart chakra vortex of the way we are feeling . Energy in and around the heart chakra can become so tense, den~e and stagnant in the face of stress, trauma or loss that this plays through to the hologram as a ht.>art attack or heart di sease.

How do you cease to be a psychopath without at some point facing experiences that awaken you from your psychopathy? Look at the language ... when we act without kindness, empathy, compassion and generosity we are said to be 'heartless'. All the pressure from Archontic society and The System is for you to act from the head. Dog eat dog , winner takes all, look after number one. Yes, we must look after number one in that we should have love and respect for ourselves, but what is this 'number one' - Phantom 'one' or Infinite 'one'? Which 'one' are we 'looking after'? The phrase obviously refer s to Phantom 'one' that must fight, battle, kick and cuss to compete with other Phantom 'ones ' . But isn't that how we got into this mess? By looking after (in theory) the wrong number one? Heart people don't neglect themselves. They know the belief that spiritual purity lies in suffering and poverty is non ense. Sackcloth and ashes are for the Phantom not the Infinite. Kindness, empathy, compassion and generosity must be applied to ourselves as well as others. We are all the same' one'. A lot of people forget this need for kindness for themselves and in doing so create another Phantom program . 'Look at how spiritual I am, going without and suffering to help others.' This is actually another self-identity, another label, another Phantom Self. Heart just is. It doesn't need labels of isolated !>elf-identity whatever they may be. Heart people know that no one has to go without for others to have. This is such a myth. I know it seems like that from daily experience but remember always that what we experience is a fake reality in which the illusion of limitation is a vital mechanism of control. How can we run out of anything when our experienced reality is only a holographic manifestation of our sense of reality? We experience limitation and shortage by lidfr'V . i11g in limitation and shortage and have been programmed to do so since the baby met the midwife. In fact, this u1n happen even before that through energetic influence of the mother. Heart people are not martyrs for they know they are not necessary. Martyrs and martyrdom are more Phantom Self labels and delusions playing their role in the stage play. Heart people look after themselves, have kindness, empathy, compassion and generosity for themselves , but here's the point - not at the expense of others. Not to the detriment, suffering, control or loss of others. Heart people seek win-win, not win-lose. With heart economics no one would go without while with head economics this is essential.

For now we have to deal with perception as it is, but nothing can change without opening the heart to Infinite Self. It is the power of the heart that will get us through this and out of this. George Orwell wrote in 1984: 'They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.' Check li st Here is a summary of what I have found helpful and this wi11 definitely kick-start an awakening in anyone if it is done with genuine intent. Re-identify yourself with Infinite Awareness or superconsciousness having an experience instead of believing you are the experience. This alone will instigate a consciousness and frequency shift that will s tart to sync Phantom you with superconscious you. Say it to yourself as often as you like - I am Infinite Awareness, I am Infinite Awarene ss. Words are frequencies and can empower the awakening if they come from the heart and not the head. When you face a situation that i.s pulling you back into Phantom reality (and you will) stop and consciously reaffirm your new s ense of self - I am Lnfinite Awareness, I am Infinite Awareness and this is just an experience. Ditch all 'this world' label s to define your self- identity. If you identify with a label you are Phantom Self. You are not black, white, Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, rich, poor or any of those things. They are only what you are experiencing and believe yourself to be. You are Infinite Awareness having those experiences. This may sound simplistic but it's not. What you self-identify with you become. I am not David lcke - that is my experience. I am not an author - that is my experience. I am not even human - that is my experience. Th e System is now manipulating people through political correctness to sub-divide into even smaller labels as man and woman, black and white sub-divide into 'non-binary' or ' BME' . Further and further they go from self-identity with superconscious Infinite Seit. We will know we ' re getting somewhere when we hear this: ' Hello, who are you?' 'I am lnfinite Awarenes s having an experience.' 'Oh, so am I - pleased to meet you.'

My o, ... ·n philosophy is simple: Do what you like so long as you don't impose it on others. Ponder on that and you'll see that it covers ev erything through a simple word called 'respect'. No Jaws would be necessary if we lived like that and it's perfectly possible when superconsciousness prevails over Phantom Self. Some laws are required for Phantom Self only because it's an idiot.

Giordano Bruno said centuries ago: It is proof of a b.1se and low mind for one to wish to think with the masses or majority, mer ely hecause the majority is the majority. Truth does not change because it is or is not believed by the majority of the people. Mahatma Gandhi took the same view: Many people, especially ignorant people , want to punish you for speaking the truth, for be ing correct. for being you. Never apologise ior being correct, or ior being years ahead of your time. If you're right and you know it, speak your mind. Speak your mind. Even ii you are a mino rity of one. the truth is still the truth. The mystic Osho put it like this: The greatest iear in the world is of the opinions of others and the moment you are unafraid of the crowd, you are no longer a sheep. You become a lion. A great roar rises from your hea rt- the roar of freedom. People give their uniqueness away by comparing themselves with others, but th ey are them and you are yo11.

I have stayed with situations I didn't like when my intuition s aid 'hang in there' and then suddenly when the experience had delivered its gift of insight and self- reali s ation my intuition said 'time to go ' . I could not have uncovered and communicated a fraction of what I have without heart intuition which has been superconsciousness opening and closing doors to synchronistically guide me through what would be for Phantom Self, the head self , an incomprehensible maze. Awakening people notice how synchronicity and 'coincidence' increase in their life and the strengthening connection with s uperconsci o usness is the rea s on for that. Phantom Self is obsessed with outcomes - 'I want it to be like this, ' it must be like that', but this is a mug's game. By focussing on a specific outcome you are s etting yourself up for disappoinbnent if that one outcome doesn't happen. People can spend entire lifetime s banging their head against a door that will not open when infinite possibilities await them elsewhere. Those who have awakened to superconsciousness go with the s ynchronicity of event s. They know that is superconsciousness at work. I have learned profoundly over the years that if it is difficult it is not meant to be and if it flows - go with it. Near-death experiencer Anita Moorjani said : I detach myself from preconceived outcome s and trust that all is well. Being myself allows the wholeness of my unique magnificence to draw me in thos e directions mo st beneficial to me and to a ll others. This is re a lly th e only thing I have to do.

As you choose intuition over thought a heart connection to superconsciousness will open and the more powerful, sensitive and insightful your knowing will become. ln the end intuition will not have to win a battle with the head. They will be moving as one unit in heart-brain coherence as Phantom Head s ees that when you follow your intuition you may face challenges but it all works out in the end to youI benefit. Once Phantom Head s ee s thi s, it is no longer Phantom Head. Heart and head come together. Remember, too, that heart intuition a nd superconsciousness can say 'no' as well as 'yes' - 'don ' t go there ' as well as 'go there'. It is not about lovey-dovey saying yes to everything becau se you want to be s een as being kind and generous. Superconscious intuition makes us s treetwise to what we don't need to experience. lt is observing this reality from another reality and can s ee all. Superconsciousness often says no, have nothing to do with him, her or it.

Courage is overriding programmed respon ses of Phantom Self until so much superconsciousness is driving the bus that courage is no longer needed to overcome fear that no longer exists. Superconsciousness doesn't fear - it knows there is nothing to fea r. It is False Emotion Appearing Real. People talk about the courage of the heart and the heart's connection to superconsciousness is the source of that courage. Self-identifying with Infinite Self is crucial to overriding fear and summoning the courage to act when Phantom Self is screaming 'No, no, what about the consequences'. There is also the littl e matter that the consequences of not acting will be far, far, worse than the challenges of doing so . Quiet time It may seem for a few minute s that I am leaving the theme of awakening, but I'm not as you ' ll see. We Live in a world that is founded on work as you would expect from a world founded on slavery. From the earliest age we are told to 'work hard' and from first school to last job people are largely judged by their 'work ethic'. The point of life, you see, is to work, work, work and then, er, die. Who decided that, may I ask? Alill, Th e System decided that and the program makes you feel guilty if you don't work, work, work and then, er, die. Bloody slacker. Every government solution to economic crise s is that people must work harder and for less. Thb tired old baloney from presidential wannabe Jeb Bush speaks for them all: My aspiration for the country, a nd I believe we can achieve it, is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see . Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours, and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That's the only way we're goin g to get out of this rut that we're in. Same old, s ame old. Humans are servants of The System and have no right to joy, happiness or fulfilment. They are here to work and work until they can work no more (Fig 709). The System doesn't refer to the ma ~ses as people, but as workers and consumer s . Our role is only to work and con s ume to en s ure more 'growth'. Work 'til you die, shop 'til you drop. We can only survive and prosper if we have 'growth ' . We must work to ensure 'growth'. Do you know what growth is, or gro ss domestic produ ct Figure 709: Don 't awaken - work! · (GDP)?

How about these for measurements of success - how few people are ill; how few are hungry; how few are homeles~ how few are in poverty; how few are not free; how few are unhappy; how few are unfulfilled; how few are not living the life that they want. But, no - we must forever plunder more resources, cause more pollution, devastate more land and communjties to make more things, sell more things and throw away more things to worship the god of economic 'growth'. To pursue this insanity we must 'work harder'. Do people have to work as hard and as long as they do? No, they don't. The System forces this upon them by ensuring that only by doing a System job to The System's benefit and satisfaction will you earn money to pay for food, shelter and warmth never mind everything else we are told is :,o essential. Not got the latest iPhone? Wlrat? Get a life, what a loser. Work is another hoax to enslave us. I am not saying that people shouldn't do things and contribute to the wellbeing of themselves and society, but we don't have that. We have slavery- work slavery. The world is a labour camp that thinks it is free.

If they pondered for longer on what they do, and were not in denial of a truth they don't want to face, the number 'Would have been even higher. How many people wake up in the morning with joy in their hearts delighted they are going to work? The answer is so very few compared with those with aching hearts and anxious bellies at the thought of reporting for duty at their daiJy prison cell. Research has revealed a 'pandemic' of bum out across' all age groups, genders, professions, and cultures' and Scient~fic America11 Mind reported that job satisfaction worldwide is in 'a surprisingly fragile state'. What the hell is surprising about it? To repeat what American comedian and sociaJ observer George Carling said: Oh, you hate your job? Why didn't you say so? There's a support group for that. It's called everybodv and they meet at the bar. Work, work, work and then, er, die? This is We? No, it's not 'life' because it's not living. It's existing, surviving, slaving. George Carling also said that 'we've learned how to make a living but not a life'. The bar, drugs, all forms of escapism are toe cape the sou Iles~ dn1dgery and monotony and to somehow feel alive. From the age of four you have teachers telling you what you can do and can't do, where you can go and not go, and when you escape from that prison you enter the next one - the 'world of work' - when bosses tell you for the rest of your working life what you can do and can't do, where you can go and not go. Then you retire usually to live on a pension that leaves you cold and hungry before you, er, die. What the fuck are we doing? The System is mad but even madder is that humaruty stands for it. Humans are not slaves? I rest my case, M'lud. Humanity by the billion is held fast in slavery by a system controlled by the ridiculously few and \\Ve call it life, living or even freedom.

Children and young people focus almost all day at school follmved by homework and most of the rest of their time is taken by technology and other forms of focus, toru s, focus. Awakening to superconsciousness is expanded and speeded immensely by qui et reflection without focus when our point of attention - focus of attention - can wander where it pleases. Many people meditate using variow, techniques but I never have. I prefer to just sit quietly and give my attention a ticket to anywhere.

Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think , back on the farm with the other animals, as the Silent Wenpons document sa id more than 35 years ago. Daydreaming is not about clearing your mind but freeing your mind to wander a nd ad- lib. Even more than that it is freeing your awarene s~ from mind altogether. Tell omcone to clear their mind and their mind will immediately be focussed on 'I must clear my mind'. Part of the process of daydreaming is quiet tjme without distractions that entrap focus.

Reading books is fine becau~e I find s ome of my most powerful daydreaming come s that way as my mind wanders from the page and goe s its own way. Find time for yourself to be alone and you'll be amazed by the cumulative effect as superconsciousness establishes an ever-stronger connection and the s ame with using your imagination . Treat past and future as the iUusions that they are and know that the only moment that exists is the NOW . This can be challenging at first. Everything around you and running through Phantom Self programs is telling you that past and future are real. What we call past and future are experienced in the NOW and to live in the illusion of past and future is to live in Phantom Self which is governed and controlled by a sense of time. Regret and resentment from the 'past' and fear of the 'future' arc powerful forces to pull you out of the NOW, or your sense of it. You can't change what has gone - take the experience as a gift of greater awarene ss . You can change what we perceive as the future by changing what you are in the NOW - experienced reality is 'possibilities and probabilities folded into exL'itence by perception '. 'What do we do ?' People ask for solutions to what is happening to the \\vorld in term :, of action - 'What do we do?' But where does this 'doing' come from? It come s from your state of being. This point is so tragically missed , not least by most of the alternative media and research community. Our collective state of being- perceptions, attitudes - manifests as the world that we 'see'. If they don't change then nothing else can. lf we want a world of kindness we need to be kind. lf we want a world of peace we need to be peaceful. If we want a world of love we need to be loving. This is not esoteric naval-gazing- it is simple, solid-gold fact. We have the world we have because so many are not kind, peaceful and loving. How else co uld it be so? Jim Morrison, le ad singer in 60s band, Tl,e Doors, said: The most important freedom is to be what you really are . You trade your reality for a role. You trade your sense for an act.

They are talking about waking up to see the manipulation of world events and while that is to be welcomed it will not change anything of significance by itself. You only have to observe the hatred, hostility. arrogance and self-centric nature of so many in the alternative media who have woken up to the five-sense manipulation but have not awoken to their true self. Superconsciousness doesn't behave like that and it is perfectly possible to have some knowledge of global manipulation while remainin g a Phantom entrapped in the frequency prison of the Archon virus. They, nor anyone else, can escape through their head. It can only be done through the heart - the gatewa y to superconsciousness. 'Getting our heads together' to work out a response to global tyranny and madness will take us nowhere. We will be trying to solve the madness from within the madness and what will result can only be another version of madness. 'We must fight' will be in there for sure. We must fight the tyranny, fight for justice, fight because the head can only see fighting as a response to its fear. Either that or heading for the hills, as in fight or flight. I don't want to fight or flight. I want to change. Fighting changes nothing in a world which is founded on fighting at every level from war to personal relationships. Fighting got us here and it won ' t get us out. We don't need to fight or flight. We need to remember. Or, more than that, we need to connect v.rith the Infinity within us that does not need to remember because it knows and express that in what we say and do (Fig 714). Wl1en people ask what we rnn do and what are the 'solutions' they mean how can we act; but actions come from perceptions and perception!'> come from our state of awareness. Solutions from the Phantom are ne\\'er solutions. They are at best holding positions until the next problem come~ along in response to the last 'solution' . It's another form of fighting as solutions fight problem s and problems come back for another go.

They come from us and it can be no other way when we are decoding information through the filter of perception into holographic manifestation. We are creating them through our perceptions - ' ... in a ,1uantum universe there are no such things as accidents, only possibilities and probabilities folded into existence by perception' (Fig 715). The question is not who is creating the problems. We are. The question is who or what is dictating our perceptions which then decide what possibilities and probabilities are folded into existence? Is it the virus-programmed Phantom, or superconsciousness? Problems are the speciality of Phantom Self and can only be deleted by Infinite Self. I saw a quote that said everything changes when you start to emit your own frequency rather than absorbing the frequencies around you, when you star t imprinting your intent on the Universe rather than receiving an imprint from existence. Here we have the crux of everything, the fork in the road, the ultimate choice and the route to prison or paradise. When the quote talks about receiving an imprint from existence, I would say receiving an imprint from the Archon virus. This is what Phantom docs as a manifestation of the Archon Matrix. Expand your awa . reness and self-identity beyond the Phantom and into superconsciousness and you begin to emit your ow11 frequency and imprint your intent on the Universe and not implanted Archon intent. We post on the Cosmic Internet or we get posted. Giordano Bruno said: 'The Divine light is always in Man, presenting itself to the s enses and to the comprehension, but Man rejects it.' We always have the choice to stop doing so. I could make a list of things 'we can do' in the form of action. I could talk about the need for mass non-cooperation with The System. I could say that we need to circulate information about the Archon conspiracy and nature of reality to everyone we can. I could say that we must reject transhumanism and Agenda 21 /2030 with every fibre of our being. l could point out that a world of more than seven billion can only be controlled by a relative handful if the seven billion allow that to happen through ignorance, disinterest and silence (Fig 716). I could say that we must put aside the manufactured fault lines of race, gender, culture, religion, background and income bracket that are mercilessly employed to divide and rule us. I could say we must come together in unity and harmony to meet the fantastic challenges that face us (Fig 717). I could say that 'there' s nothing I rnn do' is a cop-out to justify doing nothing .

But those who have a connection with superconsciousness will know all this; and those who don't will not respond anyway. Superconscious people don't need to be told solutions. They instinctively know them from their own expanded awareness and instinctively do them from their own commitment to making a difference. Gandhi knew what to do: You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of this evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her own soul (Fig 718). Superconsciousness is beyond the Matrix and so beyond the realm of fear. Without fear the Archons have no power. Even at the level of courage that transcends fear the Archons have no power. Their power is only the power that we give them out of fear of not doing :.o. Where does a computer virus get its power from? The computer system it has invaded. Everything comes down to moving our point of attention and awareness from the All-Thinking to the All- Knowing. Supercon scious politicians (contraction in terms, I know) would never stand for injustice, unfairness and control. Superconscious journalists would never lie, mislead, seek to hurt or stay silent when truth needs to be heard. Superconscious scientists would never fall for the illusion of solidity, fix the climate change data for political and financial ends or produce poisons and potions to serve their paymasters in Big Biotech and Big Pharma.

We create paradi se a s we have created the prison - by decoding and manifesting paradise into holographic existence. Humanity is the vehicle for manifesting its own enslav ement. Archons cannot do that without creative imagination. They can only manipulate and program our perceptions so that we create what we have been programmed consciously and subconsciously to perceive. A constant stream of movies portraying transhumanism, robots and dystopian societie s are to post perceptions in our energetic fields through pre-emptive programming. Everything is a frequency including transhumanist, dystopian societies. Plant those frequencies in the conscious and subconscious mind and people will decode them into manifestation - fold them into existence by perception.

Humans are expressions of Infinite Awareness but their perceptions were hijacked and drawn into low-frequency states by low-frequency beliefs, emotions and attitudes.

These characters orchestrating the movie in the West and the Middle East are beyond evil and it's all a gigantic hoax. Robert Baer, a former senior CIA officer who worked in Yugoslavia during 1991-94 and in the Middle East, gave an interview to WebTril11111e in November 2015 describing his experiences. They are mightily relevant to current events. He told how the ClA spent millions to break up Yugoslavia into warring factions - exactly what is being done in the Middle East and Africa which is just a continuation of the same global plan. Baer said of the CIA: They gave us files about a group called 'Supreme Serbia' detailing plans to conduct a series oi bomb attacks on key buildings in Sarajevo in opposition to Bosnia's ambition to leave former Yugoslavia. No such group ever existed! Our headquarters lied to us. Our mission was to alarm and spread panic among politicians in Bosnia, simply to iill their heads with the idea that Serbs would attack. To begin with, we accepted the story, but after a while we started to wonder. Wh y were we raising such hysteria when the group clearly did not exist? ... ... I received instructions that Slovenia was ready to declare independence. We were given money, a few million dollars, to fund various NGOs, opposition parties and various politicians who have inflamed hatred ... ... Many CIA agents and senior officers disappeared simply because they reiused to conduct propaganda against the Serbs in Yugoslavia. Personally I was shocked at the dose of lies being ied from our agencies and politicians! Many CIA agents were directed propaganda without being aware of what they are doing. Everyone knew just a fraction of the story and only the one who create the whole story knew the background ... This is the compartmentalisation that I talk about - this is how attacks such as 9/11 and Paris can be instigated with only a few of the players knowing the real story. People dismiss the idea of a Hidden Hand behind terrorist attacks like those in Paris because they involve alleged Muslims, but they miss the point of how it's done. If you are working on the shop floor for a global corporation you do your job by following orders from 'on high'; but where is this 'on high' and who are the personnel involved? You may know the hierarchy immediately above you and maybe even above them, but there comes a level beyond which you don't know what is happening or to what end. You don't know the people making the decisions and delivering the orders that come down to you through those that you do know.

The prospect ot NATO as a whole joining th e madness was made possible by the mantra within hours that the Paris attacks were 'an act of war' against France and that 'Islamic State is at war with France'. The theme began with Hollande and was then repeated by all and s undry, not least in the United States. This was highly signjficant in its clear coordination because when a member state of NATO is attacked in an 'act of war' it can open the way for the 'all-for-one' Article 5 ot the NATO Treaty. It says: Washington State. The P.:irties agree that an armed attack agains t one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack .1gainst thrm all and consequently they ,1gree that. if such an armed att,,ck occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective SC'lf-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert v. ith the other Parties. such action as it deems necessal). including the use oi armed ior<.:e, to restore and maint.1in the security oi the North Atlantic Jrea.

The United Nations Security Council approved a French proposal after the Paris attacks which authorbed 'combating' ISIS 'by all means' and France invoked for the first time an EU treaty collective-defence article asking for military <;upport from EU nations in response to the attacks. It was, of course, agreed as the Parb Problem- Reaction-Solution played out. Same old story There is a dear pattern to PRS events or 'false flags' which I have been highlighting for years and Paris had all of them once again (Fig 6). There is the finding of a 'terrorist passport' which they use to identify by name and location those they want to blame for the attack. A 'Syrian passport' w.1s found near the body of a terrori s t in Paris who had killed him~lf with a suicide bomb. There \\\\'as little left of him, but his pass11ort? Not a problem.

Yes, a paper passport fro~ a 'hijacker' who was supposed to have died in the fireball when hh plane struck the tower. I watched a BBC newsreader tell me· thi s without laughing despite the sheer idiocy of the claim, but to the BBC if it rnme from official so urce it must be true no matter how ludicrous. A year later a British television crew filming a documentary about 9 / 11 asked New York Police about the passport that !>O miraculously survived intact and they \\vere told that it was 'a rumour that might be true'. Well, of cour se it wa!--n't true - don't be insane - and how come this 'rumour that might be true' was the subject of a 'we've definitely found it' news conference calJed at the time of 9 / 11 by the FBI? The~ ridiculous official narratives are part of the perception deception and they are circulated only to sell an image that the fairy s tories mu s t be true. They know that most people will never question even the most infantile claims and they will soon forget what was said when it is l<1ter contradicted by another lie that c;uit s the moment. The '7 /7' London Tube and bus bombings in 2005 also had the passport miracle. A man who is supposed to have blown himself apart with a bomb in his backpack somehow left behind an undamaged passport, driving licence and mobile phon e insurance certificate for the police to find and identify him. How very thoughtful. It was the ~ame with the 9 / 11 ' terrorists' that we were told left Koran in their hotel rooms and hire cars. If you were a fanatical Muslim what is the last thing you would leave anywhere? They also left omc flying manuals to let us know they flew the wide-bodied jets even though their flying instructor~ described them as hopeless when it came to piloting one-engined Cessnas. I talked earlier about s cientbts needing one miracle (the Big Bang) and they would take it from there; but with these PRS lie-fe::,ts they need far more than that.

See Alice i11 Wm1derla11d and the World Trade Center Disaster and The David /eke Guide To Tl,e Global Conspiracy for the detailed story of the 9 / 11 inside job (Fig 8). PRS terrorist attacks not only happen - they are allowed to happen by systematic breaches in security that would otherwise thwart what was planned. This is why you see 'security mistake s' as another constant theme in these situations. A drill was happening in London at the sa me time - and involving the same Tube stations - as the 7 /7 bombings and it's the s ame story with the Oklahoma bombing in 1995, the Oslo bombing of 2011, the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013. and a stream of mas s shootings in the United States which miraculously happen at the same time as drills or at locations where driJI~ regularly take place. All those drills were working to the same scenario of what actually happened in the same place at the same time. The police drill based on a bomb going off in Oslo ended just 26 minutes before the real one went off in the same place. And, yes, a drill was happening in Paris on the same day as the 2015 attacks founded on the s,,mc scenario of what really happened. The 7 /7 London attacks also took place during a G8 summit meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland, so they could be milked to sell the 'solution' and the Paris attacks were on the eve of the G20 summit in Turkey where world leaders were meeting across the border from Syria to discuss their response to Islamic State terrorism. You couldn't make it up - and you don't have to because tht•y do. Many other attacks will be planned (another in Britain eventually) to terrify the population into subservience and compliance - we must not fall for it. The road to World War Ill Days after Paris with politicians in meltdown hysteria to expand bombing in Syria and delete freedoms at home came the attack on a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the ludicrous grounds that it had breached Turkish airspace. Russia said that it did not enter Turkey airspace and for sure the plane came down in Syria. Even the Turkish authoritie s only claimed tJ,at it entered their airspace for 17 seconds.

The last thing they wanted was for Putin's Russia to come in and start trying to defeat them when the American-led bombing of ISIS had got nowhere because it wasn't meant to. Turkey has been key to the survival and proo;perity of ISIS with weapons and <;upplies passing acros\" its border to ISIS in Syria and Iraq while oil su pplies seized by ISIS came the other way to be sold via Turkey around the world. The Russian government produced evidence in support of this and, together with other reports galore, connected Erdogan and his son, Bilal, to this oil trafficking which is said to constitute some 50 percent of ISIS income. Fighter~ joining 1515 also reach their destination through Turkey, an allegedly 'democratic' country which Erdogan has turned into his own Islamic fiefdom while destroying any idea of freedom of the press or free political oppo..,ition.

Russia began Ill defend its bombers \\\\ 1 ith fighter planes while shipping into Syria ~tate-of-art missile defences and deploying a missile cnih,er off the Syria coast with orders to destroy any target posing danger. The potential for Albert Pike's World War Ill ha.s never been greater and it is happening in the way he described out of the Middle East with the unlea hing of his 'Nihilists' - the Western-created Islamic State I ISIS/ ISIL. So much has happened in tht' two weeks between finishing the body of the book and the printing process starting and more is sure to have happened by the time you read this as engineered terrorbm and ·war goes on being used to transform global society in the way I have de:-cribed. Watch for China being pulled into the picture. Another consequence of the Pari<, attacks and events in Syria has been to increase calls for cl European Union ,umy - long predicted in my books - as another stepping-stone to the world army."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"434 Belgium's Prime Minister, Charles Michel, responded to Paris with a call for the creation of a European CIA: 'We must quickly put in place a European intelligt!flce agency, a European CIA' [to] 'unmask those with hostile intentions.' Try Washington, London, Paris, Ankara, Tel Aviv etc., etc. Cl imate Mecca - the believers assemble As the book goes to press negotiators from 195 cow1tries are attending the late~t 'climate change' summit in - yes, Paris - called COP21. Most of them tmly believe that they are in a desperate race to save the planet when, in truth, what they think they are 'fighting ' doesn't actually exist. They buy the lies through mendacious repetition and/ or because of the endless flows of money for those who will promote the fairy tale. Leaders from 1-l7 nations addressed the event and sang from the song sheet. Barack 'I am speaking so it must be bollocks' Obama even had the ludicrous audacity to connect climate change to fighting terrorism using his location as the peg: 'What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshalling our best efforts to save it?' His speech was sickening in both its inversion of truth and its calculated manipulation. The mainstream media repeated unquestioned the unsupported claims and blatant lies about human-caused 'global warming' and protestors who would normally oppose the Establishment turned up to demand that 'global warming' be addressed by transforming the world into the very fascist dictatorship that they, at other times, turn out to protest against. It takes 'being had' into a whole new level of meaning. Tt is such a head- shaker to watch people demand th eir own enslavement while having no idea that they are doing so. The aim of COP21, as with all these climate summits, was to secu re as many legally- binding agreements as possible beh'\\Teen countries to centrally-dictate their domestic policy and so impose the demands of Agenda 21 /2030 - the Hunger Games Society. Prominent scientists meeting in Texas before the Paris farce declared that fears about human-caused global warming were 'irrational' and 'based on nonsense' (Fig 11) . We were being led down a 'false path' by what they called 'catastrophism'. As one put it: 'Demonisation of C02 is irrational at best and even modest warming is mostly beneficial.' The latter is confirmed by PROMINENT SCIENTISTS SAV i CLIMATE CHANGE CLAIMS BASED ON NONSENSE I, .:;;,,.: tt \"- . . /.a: -;;- ' ,- \" NOW , NOW ...

Greenpeace Co- Founder Dr Patrick Moore i,aid: 'We are deaLing with pure political propaganda that has nothing to do with science.' But instead of li~tening to scientists who produce evidence to expose the said nonsense we have increasing efforts to silence them (Fig 12). US Secretary of State John Kerry said before COP21: 'The science tells us unequivocally [like hell it does] - those who continue to make climate change a political fight put us all at rbk and we cannot sit idly by and allow them to do that.' The discredited James Hansen, who has been exposed Figure 13: The w.1r on truth. for fixing climate data in support of the lie, called for the prosecution of those who challenge the propaganda for 'high crimes against humanity' while Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said of those with a mind to call their own: 'This is treason, and we need to start treating them as traitors.' Joe Romm, a former Clinton official now running the CLimatePmgress website, went further in his warning to non-believers and climate infideb: 'It is not my wrath you need fear f trueJ when there's an entire generation that will soon be ready to strangle you ,md your kind while you sleep in your beds.' Oh, really? I'm shaking. The double-whammy of generating ever more fear through war and terrorist attacks, while silencing those who expose or see the conspiracy, are themes that become more obvious by the day. This includes the leaflet distributed to parents by government 'child protection officials' in Britain warning that opposing government policy and mistrusting the mainstream media are signs that children and young people have been 'radicalised' (Fig 13). Parents were also warned that 'a belief in conspiracy theories' could be a sign of grooming by 'extremists'. See how terrified The System is of the truth when its very existence depends on the lie? I take enormous encouragement from the way far more people are awakening to that truth- or some levels of it, anyway. This can be :,een in the increasing distain that people have for the claims of officialdom and indeed the massive surge in the interest in my work during the writing of this book.
