People reading it will probably fall into one ofthree main categories: those who laugh; those who condemn; and those for whom itwill change their lives forever. And with every month and year that passes, thelatter group will grow and grow until it is the largest.The transformation of humankind is upon us, and there is nothing more urgent forhumanity, I would most strongly suggest, than to listen to the message that isset before you here. It is impossible to overstate that urgency. The earth andall the life she supports is in the process of changes of an incomprehensiblemagnitude. Nothing and no one will be the same again. The earth is moving on tothe next stage of her evolution, and new energies, new vibrations, are beginningto encircle the planet. The changes began in the mid-1960s, and the volume isabout to be turned up rapidly through the 1990s and beyond.As the vibrations have quickened, so have they changed the thinking of millions,and humanity is being divided into those who are tuning in and those who arenot; those who are evolving at a fast speed and those stuck in the delusions ofthe material world. I have called these new energies Truth Vibrations, becausethey will affect – are affecting – our consciousness and understanding in such away that we will open our eyes to the truths about God and life, truths whichhave been forgotten for so long.This book will explain how you can tune in to these higher energies and how we,as a human race, can reduce the impact of the physical events the earth is dueto undergo. There is much we can do for ourselves and the planet, but we muststart now. To do this, however, will require a gigantic leap in humanconsciousness. We will have to let go of our old beliefs and perceptions in theface of the spiritual truths.You can appreciate the scale of that leap when I tell you that these truths havebeen given to me by some of the most evolved beings in this solar system. We arenot alone or even nearly alone. Every planet and star is pulsating with life,and we on earth in physical bodies are only a tiny part of the wonder that isCreation. Forgetting these truths has produced a world consumed by the emotionof fear. We fear death, we fear life, we fear today, we fear tomorrow. There isno need! There really is nothing to fear but fear itself. There is no such thingas death, and no matter what happens to us during our short visit to earth, wesimply go back from whence we came. After a while our souls return in anotherphysical body, usually in different circumstances, to learn more lessons andgain more experience in order to speed our evolution. Life is not for a fewyears on this planet. It is forever.Crazy? A candidate for the funny farm? Many will think so, and I can understandthis, given the way we are conditioned to believe whatever may be the prevailing‘wisdom’ of the time. But it will not be many years before those who cling on tocurrent thinking will be the ones labelled ‘crazy’. Remember how they ridiculedthose who said the earth was round? It is this scale of transformation thathuman perception is about to undergo, and it will happen, not over centuries,but over the next few years, to the end of this decade.I could have written this book in a different way and made it an exercise inlaughter-limitation. I could have ignored the more fantastic experiences thatchallenge belief, but that is not what I have chosen to do, nor what I have beenasked to do. I have set out exactly what has happened to me and what I have beentold. All the information in these pages has come through psychic communicationsor been confirmed as accurate by those communications. They have been passed onthrough many mediums and sensitives, most of whom had no idea what others hadalready told me, nor even knew of their existence. Some of the names of peopleinvolved in this story have been changed to protect them and their work. Wherefull names have been given they are correct.The energy I have termed the Truth Vibrations has a specific role to play in thetransformation of human thought. It has been ‘commissioned’ to take thespiritual truths out of the shadows, off the fringes, and onto the centre stageof debate. Once there, these truths cannot fail to triumph because they providethe only credible explanation for the meaning of life.I hope the traditional churches will hear this message in the way it is given. Ido not point out misunderstanding with any sense of malice or condemnation. Suchemotions are of no value. But too many of the major church movements haveallowed dogma to turn thinking into heresy, and it is time that was peacefullychallenged. As Albert Schweitzer said: “It will ever remain incomprehensiblethat our generation, so great in its achievements of discovery, could be so lowspiritually as to give up thinking”.If nothing else, this book will make you think. I don’t ask you to believe whatyou read. I don’t even urge you to do so. That is your choice and yours alone.But if you open your mind, the message cannot fail to open your heart. When thathappens you will learn much truth, and that truth will set you free.December 1990In this new Gateway edition I have made few changes to the original text for tworeasons. Firstly, I feel that it still represents the basis of my understanding,although the detail is evolving all the time as my consciousness expands.Secondly, this book was written at the start of my conscious awakening and itwill be interesting for people who read my later books to see how the process ofawakening and understanding develops and expands. One major change, however isin my understanding of the nature of Jesus’ mission, in chapter 8.I want to make it quite clear that I do not recommend any specific psychics orcounsellors who are mentioned in this book. Readers must make up their own mindsabout who they seek for advice.David IckeIsle of WightDecember 1993"},{"pageContent":"1Guided by the LightI had felt for some months that I was being guided. I couldn’t hear a voice oranything like that, I just had an overwhelming feeling that I was not alone as Ijourneyed through life.And what a life it had been already. I was a professional footballer untilrheumatoid arthritis ended my career, then a journalist and televisionpresenter, before moving into politics as a national spokesperson for Britain’sGreen Party. There was a definite pattern emerging. I would go for something,achieve it, leave it, and move on to the next goal, the next experience. Itwasn’t that I consciously wanted to jump from career to career, experience toexperience – circumstances dictated the sequence.My rise to prominence in the Green Party was rapid, to the point of beingridiculous. From joining the Green Party to being elected a nationalspokesperson took a mere six months, and it was at this point that I becameconvinced that I was being led by forces beyond my understanding. Somethingstrange was going on.For most of my life I had never thought much about what happens after what wecall death, or if there were anything for us beyond this sphere known as PlanetEarth. The teachings of the traditional Church made little sense to me, and sothe spiritual side of things passed me by. But the deeper I travelled into Greenpolitics, the more it became a spiritual journey. I was soon asking manyquestions about the reason for our existence. Why were we here? What happenednext? I wrote a book on Green issues, published in February 1990, called ItDoesn’t Have To Be Like This, and by then I was certain there were otherdimensions to the universe and ourselves which we could not yet comprehend. Inthe chapter called ‘Summon the Spirit’ I wrote:We are not consumption machines. We have a soul. It is our soul, our life-forcedeep within us, call it what you like, that has been suppressed, oftenextinguished, by the demands of the system which denies the existence ofanything that can’t be seen or touched, that can’t make money.It was hardly the deepest insight into the meaning of life, but it wasindicative of a fundamental change in my thinking which had been going on for ayear or two, and the pace of that change was about to lift me on to a new levelof understanding and knowledge. Life would never be the same again. Part of thepublicity tour for the Green book included a public meeting and interviews inNottingham, and I stayed with a couple who believed they, too, were being guidedby spirits. We talked for a couple of hours that evening and I found itfascinating. At one point the husband jumped from his chair, picked up a bookfrom the shelf, and said: “I’ve been told to give you this.” “Who told you?” Iasked innocently. “A spirit message”, he replied.I took the book with me and could not put it down. It was the writings of amedium recounting her experiences, and by now there was no question in my mindthat there was much more to the universe than science had yet had the breadth ofvision to discover or even perceive. What you don’t look for you have littlechance of finding; for centuries science has been a closed mind to thesepossibilities. This feeling of being guided had become intense, and I rememberone night in a hotel room saying out loud, “For goodness’ sake if you are there,contact me. This is driving me up the wall”.Then, one Saturday in early 1990, I went down to the sea-front near my home toplay football with my eight year old son Gareth. On the way I bought a bookcalled The End of Nature, which I intended to read that weekend. I still haven’tread it. After football we wandered along to the sea-front railway station tohave some lunch at a little cafe there, but it was full and we began to walkaway into the town to find another place to eat. As we left the station area, Iwas stopped by one of the railway staff who wanted to chat about a footballmatch being played that afternoon. We talked for a few minutes and I realisedGareth was missing. He was nowhere to be seen, and the only place he could bewas in the station newsagents. I walked in and there he was, looking at a bookabout railways. “Come on Gareth”, I said, “Let’s go and have some lunch”.At that moment I had this tremendous urge to look at the paperback books on thefar side of the shop. Why, I had no idea; they were usually romantic novels andsuch like, hardly my scene, and I had £13 worth of book already in my hand. Thelast thing I needed was another. But the urge, the compulsion to go, was toostrong to resist, and as I reached the first rack I saw a face smiling at mefrom the cover of a book called Mind to Mind. The face was that of Betty Shine.She is a medium and healer, a brilliant one, as I was to learn. I had neverheard the name before, but I bought the book without a second’s hesitation.Within twenty-four hours I had read her book, and first thing Monday morning Ifound her business address and wrote asking to meet her. The book was honest,simple, and totally credible in its explanations of how the physical body isonly a vehicle we use to exist on this physical plane of life. Our spirit-soulsimply went on to another plane of existence when the physical body died. Thebody we see may die, but we go on forever. She told of how the spirits of peopleformerly on earth contacted her through voice, telepathy or vision, and itconfirmed this idea of spirit guidance which I was sure was happening to me.Betty rang a few days later, and we arranged to meet for a session of healing. Ihad suffered with the arthritis since I was a teenager, and I saw this as achance to ease the pain. But that was not my real motivation. I wanted to knowfor sure if I was linked up with a being or force from another dimension oflife. Betty had had many psychic experiences as a child, but it was only at theage of 45 that she realised she had healing powers. She went to a medium as alast resort when doctors failed to cure a chronic health problem; she thoughtshe was dying. The medium told her she was ill because she was born to be aspiritual healer, and there was a buildup of energy within her body that wascausing the ill-health. If she wanted to be well, she had to be a healer, sothat this energy could be released through her hands to her patients. She tookhis advice, and the moment she started healing, her health problem disappeared.My first two visits to her were without incident, though my joints became lesspainful and my understanding of life expanded enormously. Visit number three,however, was to change my life. The date was Thursday, March 29th, 1990. I layon the couch in her little healing room as she worked on my joints as usual. Ican’t explain what I began to sense, except that the atmosphere in the roombecame charged, almost thicker somehow. You could almost see the energy. I beganto search for a hair I thought I could feel on my cheek, but I found nothing. Iremembered reading in Mind to Mind that when spirits are trying to ‘lock in’ toour consciousness, it can feel like a spider’s web has been laid across yourface.At that moment Betty said: “I’m being told you have two cats, and one of themhas stomach trouble and diarrhoea. You might have to change her diet for awhile.” The cats had been with us for only a short time. I rang my wife Lindalater that day, and she said there was no sign of anything amiss with either ofthem. By the time I arrived home the following afternoon, however, one wasclearly suffering from stomach trouble and diarrhoea.A few seconds after the advice about the cats, Betty visibly shuddered. “Oh”,she said, “This is powerful – I’ll have to close my eyes for this one!” Shedescribed the vision before her as someone of immense power. He was Chinese inappearance, and the description of his dress was subsequently confirmed as thatof a mandarin. He said his last life on earth was around AD 1200 – the righttime for such a costume. He gave his name as Wang Yee Lee and added “Socrates iswith me”. Over the next ten minutes Betty paraphrased the astonishinginformation Wang was asking her to pass on to me:There will be great earthquakes. These will come as a warning to the human race.They will occur in places that have never experienced them. Taking oil from theseabed is destabilising the inner earth. The centre of the earth will move andthe poles will change. The sea spirits will rise and stop men taking oil. Thesea will reclaim the land, and humans will see they cannot do these terriblethings. They cannot abuse the elements. They have to be treated with respect.In the country in which he (that is, me) lives there will be a culturalrevolution in five years’ time. He was chosen as a youngster for his courage. Hehas been tested and has passed all the tests. He was led into football to learndiscipline and training, but when that was learned it was time to move on. Healso had to learn how to cope with disappointment, experience all the emotions,and how to get up and get on with it. The spiritual way is tough, and no onemakes it easy.He is a healer who is here to heal the earth, and he will be world-famous. Hewill face enormous opposition, but we will always be there to protect him. He isstill a child spiritually, but he will be given spiritual riches. Sometimes hewill say things and wonder where they came from. They will be our words.Knowledge will be put into his mind, and at other times he will be led toknowledge.We know he wanted us to contact him, but the time was not right. He was led hereto be contacted, not to be cured. But one day he will be completely cured. Hewill always have what he needs, but no more. He should not worry about cars –electric cars will be used in eight years’ time. In twenty years there will be adifferent kind of flying machine, very different from the aircraft of today.Time will have no meaning. Where you want to be, you will be. When he is athome, he must do family things and keep the family unit together (I had beenaway constantly working for television or the Green Party).Wang Yee Lee ended the communication with the words: “If he abuses the gifts,the gifts shall be taken away”.“What an honour”, Betty said, “I’ve never had anyone through of that powerbefore”.I wasn’t surprised at being contacted. It was a relief that I hadn’t beenimagining it all. But the source of the guidance and the messages left mestunned. Socrates was of course a man of rare wisdom. A philosopher in ancientGreece who died in 399 BC, he was charged with corrupting the young (by tellingthem truth), and after one of the most famous trials in history he was sentencedto death by drinking hemlock. He had the chance to escape and live in exile, buthe refused. He talked of the divine voice that was guiding him, and he knew farmore about the ways of the spiritual universe than modern science knows today.Souls often take on the name and form of their last or most famous life on earthwhen they make themselves known to us, and the souls that were once in thephysical bodies of Socrates and Wang Yee Lee are now on the high spiritualplanes that guide and supervise life on this planet.Four days after I was contacted, I turned on the television news and heard of anearthquake centred on Bishops Castle near the Welsh-English border, which hadaffected a large area. People ran from buildings in panic, and one witness latertold me how he saw an office block swaying as its occupants ran screaming intothe street. The quake measured 4.9 on the Richter scale, big for Britain. It wasa rather chilling experience to look at the screen, given what had happened tome I didn’t believe in coincidences anymore.The next day I was getting ready to catch the ferry to the mainland from my homeon the Isle of Wight. There wasn’t much time to spare, but I suggested I take mywife Linda for a quick lunch at a health food shop and cafe five minutes away.We had to rush, but I was keen to go. While she was organising the food, I feltcompelled to walk over to the shop’s display of books. The feeling was the sameas in the newsagent’s. I saw nothing to interest me and I was about to sit downagain when something in my mind urged me to look on the other side of thedisplay, which was one of those units that spin around. There my eyes caught theword… earthquake. It was an American book called We Are The EarthquakeGeneration – a rare book in the UK, it would appear, at least at this time. Noneof the many people I have since told about it have been able to find a copy. Iwas obviously interested in anything about earthquakes, but only when I sawmention of psychics did I begin to realise its significance.“Knowledge will be put into his mind”, I thought, “And at other times he will beled to knowledge”.The book was written by Jeffrey Goodman, an open-minded American scientist. Hewent to American psychics with proven records of accurate prediction – peoplelike Aron Abrahamsen – and asked them independently of each other how they sawthe future. Almost to the detail they predicted the same things. He added intohis study the predictions of two of history’s most famous psychics, Nostradamusand Edgar Cayce (pronounced Caysee). Nostradamus was a Frenchman born in 1503.He made many miraculous forecasts, including that of the Great Fire of London,the rise of Hitler and the work of the scientist Louis Pasteur, whom he namedspecifically. This, remember, was all predicted in the 16th century. Nostradamussaid his prophecies were the result of linking into the ‘divine source’, bygoing into a trance. This was much the same technique as that used by EdgarCayce, an American who became known as ‘The Sleeping Prophet’. Once Cayce was inhis trance he would advise, accurately, on medical conditions, and revealdetails of people’s previous lives, and why they had come to earth this time.When he died in 1945, he had completed a staggering 14,000 of these readings.Both of these men predicted massive geological activity in the run-up to theyear 2000. Other proven psychic prophets came to the same conclusion inGoodman’s book, and they showed a highly developed knowledge of geologicalprinciples in their psychic state – knowledge which they did not otherwisepossess. They predicted that in some areas land would be lost, while in othersit would rise from the sea. This would bring confirmation of the existence ofthe so-called mythical worlds of Atlantis and Mu, or Lemuria as it is alsoknown. I was already certain in my own mind that these places had existed, andthis was later to be confirmed. The psychics said that all these events wouldlead up to the year 2000, when the earth would slip off its present axis.The biggest earthquake thus far recorded by instruments had reached 8.6 on theRichter scale, but these superquakes would be more like 10 or 12, the book said.The power of a quake, as registered by Dr Charles Richter’s calculations, goesup substantially with each point of the scale. It means that a quake of themagnitude of 12 can be nearly 5,000 times more powerful than one of 8.4,depending on how close to the surface it occurs. A shallow quake willconcentrate its power and damage in a small area. A deeper one will disperse itspower over a wider area, and while more places are affected, the damage to anyspecific area is less severe.Let me make clear that I am not saying that every detail these psychicspredicted in this book will come to pass, indeed I know that some of what theyhave mentioned has already changed for the better, and will continue to do so ifwe do what is necessary. As I have said already and will expand upon later, theseverity of these events is partly up to us. I can only say that I was led tothe book because its basis is correct and, as things stand now, there is goingto be immense geological activity in this decade.Here I was in possession of this information, basic as it was, but I had no ideawhat I was meant to do with it. I rang someone I respected in the Church ofEngland for his advice. I feel the traditional Church as an organisation has letdown the world badly with its dogma and rigidity, but there are many wonderfulpeople within its ranks. The person I rang is one of these. He has an open mindand a genuine compassion and kindness of spirit. He listened to my story and wasnot in the least bit fazed by it. He asked me to call him again when we couldtalk further. He said it sounded very much like the messages to the OldTestament prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, but he advised me to “eke it outgradually” without revealing the source, rather than coming out with it all. Hewas aware of the predictable public reaction.I decided to take his advice: at this stage, without further information, it wassensible to put the message in the public arena without putting myself on theline. The following Sunday I appeared on breakfast television to talk about theenvironment, and the same afternoon I delivered the closing speech to the GreenParty Spring Conference. I used both opportunities to question the wisdom oftaking oil from the seabed, and I predicted a period of great geologicalinstability.Soon after this the ‘eye’ appeared. One evening I was lying on my bed in a hotelroom when I closed my eyes and there, forming out of the darkness, was the shapeof an eye. It was there for a split second at first before dispersing, butgradually it became permanent. Within a week I was seeing eyes wherever Ilooked! Betty Shine had said in her book that she experienced the same thing.She said it was a sign that psychic powers were developing. Why this takes theform of an eye will become apparent. I was also led to a stream of books, someby Edgar Cayce. If I was reading a book that was not approved in this way, Ifound it a real struggle. When it was one I was meant to read, I went through itvery quickly.I made two appointments to visit Betty Shine again, but both had to be cancelledfor different reasons. This was to become a regular pattern. I was only meant tosee her when higher powers wanted me to see her. When we did get together againthere was another communication from Wang Yee Lee. He began with the words “Letthere be light and there was light” and these are the messages that followed, asreported by Betty:Don’t try to do it all alone. Go hand in hand with others so you can pick eachother up as you fall.One man cannot change the world, but one man can communicate the message thatcan change the world.The written word will be there forever. The spoken word disappears on the wind.(Wang lifted his hand in a sort of wafting movement as he said this.)He will write five books in three years.Politics is not for him. He is too spiritual. Politics is anti-spiritual and itwill make him very unhappy.He will leave politics. He doesn’t have to do anything. It will happen graduallyover a year.He will leave the Isle of Wight. He will find closed minds there. It will becomedifficult for people who need to see him to get to the island, and he willleave.This will take the fear away from his eldest child. She is living in fear andthis is affecting her health and life, though she tries to hide it.This last message referred to Kerry, my daughter. Betty Shine had no idea whatit meant and had no way of knowing. It was about the terror Kerry has oftravelling in ships, even the 40 minutes between the island and the mainland.She confirmed that the fear was indeed badly affecting her, as she worried abouther next trip on the water.One other incident happened during that second communication from Wang Yee Lee,which left me even more astonished, if that is possible. About half way throughhe said: “The spirit of the book he is reading is suffering great anguish. It isin his suitcase lying against a newspaper. The book is much troubled about astory in the paper about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, and there is anarticle in the paper written by someone who is not of our kind”. In the cornerof the room was my briefcase, which had not been opened since I arrived, nor hadI left the room at any time. Once the other messages were through, Betty saidshe was being told again about the book, and I went over to open the briefcase.The book I was reading was Original Blessings, by the American Dominican Priest,Matthew Fox, and it was lying on top of a story in that morning’s paper aboutBovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, better known as Mad Cow Disease. At the backof the paper was an article by a journalist who had written some particularlyhostile comments about me some months before, and he could, I suppose, havefitted the bill as ‘someone who is not of our kind’.As I was to learn, everything has a spirit, and we pass on our own spiritualvibration to everything we create. This book contains my spirit passed onthrough the thoughts that formed together to write it, and every single copyprinted, whether my physical body is alive or dead, will carry my spirit.Amazing? Of course it is, but in this case we are not working within thelimitations of thinking that we currently impose on ourselves, and have imposedupon us, in this world of physical matter. We are dealing with the realpotential of humankind.These latest messages answered many questions. I knew what I was to do with theinformation. I was to reveal it in books along with the spiritual truths thatwill transform human understanding. ‘One man cannot change the world, but oneman can communicate the message that can change the world’. It was going to be aprivilege, but a tough one. My spiritual education, under the guidance of mastersouls, was showing me with every page and communication what was meant by “Hewas chosen as a youngster for his courage”. What I was going to say in the bookswould indeed, in the short term, bring “enormous opposition” and much hilarityand ridicule.By now, however, I had no doubts that I was dealing with the truth, and that,frankly, is all that matters."},{"pageContent":"2Life After LifeIt is clear that traditional views of God and the ways of the universe arefundamentally flawed.I was led to one book after another about reincarnation and the journey of thesoul through successive earth lives. I also read constantly of a law calledkarma, which explains so much that we usually think of as arbitrary ‘luck’ withno pattern or reason to it. How many people say, “Why me? Why do I always havethe bad luck? Why am I in these circumstances? What is it all for? What is themeaning of my life?” The conventional Church can offer few answers which thevast majority will or can be expected to accept, and the spiritual side of ourlives has been neglected as a consequence.Reincarnation was the basis of early Christianity, with the writings of men likeOrigen, and it has always been a foundation of the Eastern religions such asHinduism and Buddhism. The teachings of Jesus outlined the laws ofreincarnation, and how our thoughts and actions in one life will decide whathappens in future lives. ‘What you sow, so you shall reap’ was a superb summaryof this law of cause-and-effect called karma – a Sanskrit word meaning action.Everything we do we answer for, or benefit from, in this life or those yet tocome. So what we are is what we have been, and what we do is what we will be.Perfect justice. The Old Testament’s ‘An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’doesn’t mean that we should all take equal retribution for the wrongs done tous, though that is the way it has been understood. It means karma, the law thatensures that no one can escape the consequences of their behaviour; and if wetake our own retribution we will have to face the consequences of that, also.What a different complexion this puts on the world around us! All thoseterrorists, hit-men, mafia bosses, fraudsters, murderers, rapists and racistswho believe they are getting away with their actions if they elude the human laware being monitored every second of their lives by the spiritual law. They areshaping their destiny in this life and future lives with every thought and deed.The terrorist might be terrorised and the racist may return as a member of therace he or she so despises. An Israeli could return as an Arab and an Arab anIsraeli. A Catholic could come back as a Protestant, and a white South Africanas a black. How absurd human behaviour looks from this perspective! Weexperience many types of existence, race, colour and creed in our earth lives,and this makes a nonsense of racism and religious bigotry. They are allopportunities to learn and experience, and it is not for any of us to stand injudgment of each other, or think of ourselves as superior. God doesn’t judge, sohow can we?We have to lose our obsession with the physical and the material. It isn’twealth that matters – it is our soul’s evolution. That is why we are here. Everythought creates an energy field, and we are energy fields, spirits, formed bythe thoughts of God – or the Godhead, as spirit-communicators refer to thisforce. In the beginning we are spirit-sparks – seeds is a good way ofunderstanding it. We are only potential, the spiritual equivalent of newbornbabies. The spirit-spark begins to gain wisdom through existence on all theplanes of life until it evolves into a mighty being of love, knowledge andcompassion. At the end of this great journey we return to become part of theperfect expression of all those qualities, the Godhead. Over thousands of yearsthis truth has been lost, and endless souls have been lost to the seductions ofthe material world – the only one we have believed existed. The Jesus parable ofthe Prodigal Son was a description of the way the spirit leaves the Godhead,learns lessons, and returns. Unfortunately you can get lost sometimes on thisjourney which is what has happened to the human race.Our perceptions are about to undergo an unprecedented transformation as thistruth is revealed. We must be like children, wipe our minds of pastmisconceptions, and begin again. For instance, most people don’t suffer frommental and physical handicaps by chance – their souls give themselves disabledbodies on purpose, to develop a part of their character and experience. Maybethey have treated a disabled person badly in the past and need to understandwhat it feels like. Maybe they made someone disabled. Perhaps they need to knowhow to overcome suffering and frustration. Or it could be that they are here toteach others to love, as anyone who has known a mentally-handicapped person willappreciate – they do teach us love and affection. A soul in a handicapped bodycan be highly evolved and that handicap ceases to be when the soul leaves thebody.Cot deaths have never been explained by medical science. Some at least areconnected with karmic patterns and decisions. Sometimes a soul will decide itonly needs the experience of growth in the womb and birth to balance itsdevelopment, and so it returns to a spirit plane as soon as this isaccomplished. This would appear to us as an inexplicable cot death. It might bethat a soul incarnates and then changes its mind. Again we have the sameoutcome. But most often the souls of cot death babies are spiritual teachers wholeave the body soon after birth to present the parents with a challenge toovercome – the agony of losing a child.Unknown to our physical brain we set ourselves targets and lessons to learn ineach earth life, so we can progress spiritually. We know roughly what is comingwhen we incarnate, and we know adversity can be the greatest teacher.A message from Wang said my football career was ended by arthritis to teach mehow to “get up and get on with it”. The principle is exactly the same. This doesnot mean we should ignore disabled people or those in distress and direcircumstances – quite the opposite. The compassion we show and the help we giveis one of the tests that will decide the kind of future lives we will have, oreven if we need to return to earth again at all.There is no sense of retribution in karma. It is not the product of a vengefulGod. Such a being does not exist. We decide all these things for ourselves.Between earth lives on a spirit plane we look back at our last physicalincarnation and decide what part of our soul’s development needs improvement.The process of assessing the immediate past life can be a painful one. Onceremoved from the confines of the physical body, we see things with a differentperspective, and we are often horrified at what we have done on earth. This iswhere the idea of purgatory comes from. It is this self-assessment by the soul.Once this process is over, we continue our development on a spirit plane andplan another earth life that will give us the experience we require for furtherevolution. If that means we lose a child or have a crippled body, then that isbecause we have decided it should be unless the lifeplan is affected by our freewill or that of others. We can learn from every experience, particularly theunpleasant ones, and once we accept that and realise that every experience isthere for a reason, life becomes so much easier.The soul, often in consultation with others, selects parents which will offerthe best chance of providing the lessons it wishes to learn, and it incarnatesas their child. So when your children say they didn’t ask to be born, they arewrong. More than that, they chose you to be their parents and you chose them!With each new incarnation, we are given a certain pattern of energies needed toplay the role we have decided upon. These energies will attract the people andthe circumstances necessary for certain experiences. Most of us are not aware ofwhat we have come to do because that knowledge would prevent the challengesbeing met as planned, and being aware of what we have done in the past would betoo much for most to bear. There is a mechanism which makes us forget, so we arenot consciously burdened by past deeds while in a physical body. There are,however, people who specialise in helping you find out about past lives andpresent karma, but we are only allowed to know what we need to know and no more.We are given the gift of free will to make our own decisions about which earthlives we shall have, or if we will keep to our life-plan once we haveincarnated. Our current circumstances may not be precisely the ones we planned.When we come across a pre-arranged challenge, we may take the wrong decision. Wemay have married the wrong person or given up on something when we could havehad the determination to continue. This is how we can be diverted from ourcourse, and if we don’t achieve what we set out to achieve, or learn what wewere meant to learn, we have to come back in similar circumstances and tryagain.It is the same when people commit suicide to run away from problems. There aremany souls locked into a cycle of living life after life in the samecircumstances because they keep making the same mistakes and don’t learn thelessons, but it is comforting to know that our souls, spirit guides and guardianangels are always trying to recreate the situations which will bring us back oncourse. Either way, we are where we are today because of our own decisions andno one else’s.I am sure many people will say, “Hold on, if we have free will to decide ourearth lives, we would all make ourselves millionaires, surely?” This is toforget that we are drawn like a magnet to a greater or lesser extent to continueour evolution, though we may not appreciate that in the confines of the diver’ssuit we call the physical body. If we are to evolve we have to learn, and theonly way to do that is to experience different situations and emotions. In theend, we all come round to that truth, and plan our earth lives accordingly. Evenwhat we would call ‘evil’ people see sense eventually. They are left to play outtheir misguided fantasies on the lowest nonphysical plane until they ask forhelp to progress.Once they ask for help it is immediately at hand, and they are advised on howbest to pay back karmic debts they have accumulated. This is never done all atonce. No one is put into circumstances he or she is not equipped to handle.Souls often incarnate in groups and play many different roles in their variousearth lifetimes, male and female. All the world really is a stage and we are theactors. A soul is neither male nor female, but both, as is God. It may be thatthe soul of a person’s wife may once have been his/her husband or child or closefriend. When karmic debts are built up between certain souls, they incarnatetogether to pay them back. It is possible that you did something to a member ormembers of your family in a past life, and you are here to work off that debtwith love and support – or, of course, it could just as easily be the other wayround, or, most often, mutual. Groups of souls also come to earth together ifthey have a specific job to do for the world in general.So much can be explained by the law of karma. It affects not only individualsouls, but also families, groups, sects, companies, races, nations and humanityas a whole. The human race is facing its karma now. All build up karmic debts ifthey harm any form of life, and this is why we have cycles of races, countries,companies, etc., rising to the top and then collapsing in bankruptcy orsuffering. It may pay us to do the right thing by all life-forms from the start,for this could help us with adverse karma.The earth is, in effect, a spiritual university. It offers the opportunity forsouls to get back on the right path if they so choose. It is, in every sense,the university of life because the challenges of living in a shell of densephysical matter are the toughest of all. The upheavals awaiting us in thisdecade and beyond are the hardest examination we can face, but we knew what wewere letting ourselves in for when we came. We must remember, too, that we don’tspend long in the classroom at any one time. We live forever, and the period weinhabit the physical body is nothing compared with eternity.The best advice in relation to reincarnation and karma is “Do unto others as youwould have them do unto you”. There is a similar theme in the Bible which I feeloriginally related to explanations by Jesus of reincarnation. But you have somuch more power over people if you can persuade them that they are judged on onelife before going to heaven or hell forever and that they will only go to heavenif they believe what you want them to believe for your own benefit. This was themotiviation that led many popes and other Church and political leaders to changethe Bible to suit their own ends over the centuries. When you think that it hasbeen shown again and again that the Vatican forged many ‘historical’ documentsto hoodwink kings and others to do what the Roman Catholic Church wanted them todo, it is the height of naivety to believe they would not also change and forgemany parts of the Biblical texts for the same reasons.I believe there has been tinkering and change all through the Bible’s life,particularly at certain points such as the time of the Roman Emperor,Constantine the Great, around AD 325. It was he who turned the Christianreligion into the state Church of the Roman Empire with all the horrificimplications that were to follow for anyone who did not follow the creed heinsisted was right. I feel it was during his reign that references toreincarnation were taken from the Bible. With so few people able to read and sofew copies of the texts around anyway, that would not have been the enormoustask it might at first appear.I know that many others feel that re-incarnation was lost from the Bible at ameeting of the Ecumenical Church Council called by the Byzantine Emperor,Justinian at Constantinople in AD 553. The story goes that this was the resultof Justinian’s marriage to an actress called Theodora. He was dominated by herpersonality, and she effectively became ruler, and a tyrannical one at that. Herenemies were slain in large numbers and she came into bitter conflict with theChurch of Rome.At this time a sect called the Monophysites came onto the scene. They rejectedthe Christian teaching on reincarnation. Theodora became a convert to theMonophysite beliefs, not least because if reincarnation and karma were a fact,she was going to have many problems to face in her future lives, until she hadlearned the lessons of her actions in this one. She set about obliterating allmention of these laws in the Bible, and in doing so she presumably believed thatsomehow they would no longer apply to her.Pope Agapetus admonished Justinian for allowing Theodora to appoint a yes-man asPatriarch of Constantinople, and Justinian agreed to replace him with someoneacceptable to Rome. The Pope died, very conveniently, soon after. Theodora wroteto his successor Pope Silverius demanding that he reappoint the yes-man aspatriarch. When the Pope received her communication he said: “I know very wellthat this affair has brought an end to my life”. He stuck with his principlesand refused her request. She organised a campaign of lies andcharacter-assassination that led to him being defrocked and sent into exile,where he ‘died’ Such was her power that she became the first Empress to appointher own Pope. This was Virgilius, appointed in 538. She had, by then, had twoPopes murdered, and appointed another.Theodora died around 547, but Justinian was so hypnotised by her that hecontinued where she left off, convinced that both would be equally powerfulrulers in the great beyond, if only he could rid the Bible of all reference toreincarnation and karma. In 553, Justinian convened the Ecumenical ChurchCouncil on the pretext of agreeing a minor change to the Canon Law. However heinvited only six bishops, who followed the teaching of Origen on reincarnation,while there were 159 who followed the Monophysite anti-reincarnation creed. Iwonder how the voting went.Even Theodora’s Pope Virgilius was outraged, and demanded equal representation.This was turned down, and the Pope refused to attend the Council. It was at thisCouncil that Origen was condemned as a heretic, and the decision was made toremove all references to reincarnation and karma from the Bible. I don’t know ifall or any of this particular story is true, but I have no doubt whatsoever thatexplanations of how consciousness is eternal for everyone were deleted from theBible text for reasons of personal and collective power. Over a period of time,perhaps in a process of death by a thousands cuts, truths were removed and theChurch was condemned to teach an illusion from then on. No wonder its teachingis so full of contradictions! When you consider that such fundamental passageswere lost, plus the many other changes and misinterpretations, it is anear-miracle that the Bible still contains so much truth.A few references to reincarnation do survive. The most obvious one comes afterthe disciples ask Christ about the predictions of the Old Testament scribes,that the prophet Elias (or Elijah) would return again before the coming of theLord:And Jesus answered and said unto them, “Elias shall come first and restore allthings. But I say unto you that Elias is come already, and they knew him not,but have done unto him whatever they listed. Likewise shall the Son of Mansuffer of them. Then the disciples understood that He spake of John the Baptist.(Matthew, 17, 11-13).The soul of the Old testament prophet Elias or Elijah had reincarnated into thebody of the man we know as John the Baptist. The American psychic, Edgar Cayce,read the Bible once for every year of his life. He was, therefore, deeplyshocked when he awoke from a trance in 1923 to be told that he had been sayingthat reincarnation was a fact. He was soon to have no doubts as the evidencemounted until it was overwhelming. Others have gone through the same processfrom disbelief to total belief, as they see there can be no other credibleexplanation for what happens to us.I met someone who already knew about four of his past lives on earth after areading by Judy Hall, a lady in Dorset who specialises in psychic communicationsand astrology, which reveal both past lives and the reason for the present one.I was intrigued and wrote to her. All she needs are a picture and the date, timeand place of birth. She knew nothing of substance about what had happened to me.When her tape arrived it was quite an experience. I now believed totally inreincarnation and karma, but it is still strange to hear about who your soul hadbeen in previous lives.First she said that from the moment she picked up my astrological chart she wasaware of “tremendous psychic energy”, which she felt had been sent to help herwith my reading. My purposes in this life involved the “collective power ofhumanity” and working to bring in change. This was confirmed, she said, by theposition of the planets in the astrological area of the solar system known asAquarius. My role would be to help bring about a spiritual revolution, and Iwould become a “cosmic parent” to the planet and humanity. Other planetarysequences at the time of my birth had given me enormous power to get things doneand to stand up for what I believed. “I would imagine if you put your mind todoing something, nothing on Earth will shift you. You will go on when othersgive up, and you get there in the end. If you harness your mind with thatwill-for-change you can literally do anything.”There was a deep karmic purpose behind my childhood, my parents and all myrelationships. In other words they were, or are, all linked to the reason I amon Earth this time. She said my purpose was to go out into the public eye and beseen to stand up for what I believed in, and to convey a new understanding. “Youhave taken on quite a task – nurturing the world mentally and physically”. Idid, however, have plenty of help. “Psychically, I think you are surrounded –there’s this huge host who are there ready and willing to help. Your task iswhat is important”.The whole astrological chart, Judy Hall noted, was “pretty powerful in terms ofwhere you have been and where you are going”. I had the potential to be‘incredibly psychic’ with the ability to channel information down to earth fromelsewhere. This power would soon be activated, and when that happened I would beput on a different plane altogether. Betty Shine had told me something similartwo months earlier.Judy said she was being told psychically that I had lived many simple livesworshipping ‘the Great Mother’, and gaining attunement with the cycles of theearth. These were very primitive lives from today’s perspective, butnevertheless important because “you have total unity, total attunement. I have asense that for the task you have, you need to go right back to your roots,really getting in touch with the earth’s energy and using it to ground you soyou can take off spiritually”.She then came up with three of my soul’s specific past lives: the soldier, thespy and the medium. My determination to end environmental destruction had beenimplanted in my eternal spirit-soul after experiencing the Russianscorched-earth policy, when they burned the entire landscape to stop the advanceof Napoleon. I had been a general in his army. Seeing the desolation had made medetermined to stop environmental degradation, and in that same life I hadlearned the futility of war, and when to retreat and re-group for another day.She said that in the early part of this century I had lived in the south of theUnited States and I had been a victim of the witch-hunts against fraudulentmediums, in which the escapologist Houdini was heavily involved. I had beenbranded a fraud when I was not, and to have my integrity questioned and thewhole meaning of my life brought into doubt had devastated me. She believed thatthis life had ended in suicide when I was still quite young.She then had a vision of a spider sitting in the centre of a web and everythingbeing brought to him. This was symbolic of many things including a life I had inthe reign of Elizabeth I. I had been like that spider, at the centre of a sortof secret service, gathering intelligence. It had not been merely politicalinformation. I had received a lot of occult and esoteric knowledge which Iprocessed and passed on to people. It had been a position of considerable power.If I had given information about people to certain quarters they would have beenkilled.But apparently I didn’t do that. “It’s quite interesting,” Judy remarked on thetape, “You had an ethical and moral stand for the work you did, when most peoplewould regard the work as unethical”. If the people in question were politiciansI supported I would quietly compile a dossier on them; and if I didn’t supportthem I would tell them I knew what they were doing and that they should desist.She said that many of those people were around me, or would be around me, inthis life to pay back that debt in the form of support. They weren’t forced todo this because they had free will, but their souls were giving themselves theopportunity. Another interesting aspect was that she said I’d had a strongconnection with Francis Bacon, the famous philosopher, and one of the mostbrilliant men the world has seen. This was important because I was close enoughto be aware of the knowledge he acquired.Judy finished the tape with a look at the future. She saw a vision of anunmistakable woman from Colombia. A meeting with her was planned for me. “She’senormous, absolutely huge, with very long, dark hair. It’s more or lessstraight, just a bit curly at the ends. She’s got one of those necks thatdisappear into her chin, and very distinctive sloping shoulders. She isincredibly powerful, and something she says is the key to the final work youhave to do. What you are about to embark on is an interim stage, and later youwill be used much more as yourself. I sense that you are being used as amouthpiece and that later your own powers will be used. This woman is to do withthat. It’s such a turning-point. After that I can only see you bathed intremendous light.”Two of those past lives were difficult to follow up, but the Elizabethan onelooked promising. Surely it wouldn’t be hard to track down someone very close toFrancis Bacon, who ran a secret service operation? It wasn’t. In my locallibrary I found a book within a few minutes called Elizabeth and Essex. In itwere many references to a man who setup a network of information-gathering forLord Essex, and had people all over Europe working for him. His name… AnthonyBacon, brother of Francis. It is weird in the extreme to sit there looking at apicture of someone your soul was part of 400 years ago.In the end, Queen Elizabeth and Lord Essex fell out in rather a big way, andAnthony Bacon was a victim of that. The book summed up his last days: “AnthonyBacon found rest which this world had never given him. The terribleconcatenation of events – the loss of his master, his brother, the ruin of hishopes, the triumph of folly, passion and wickedness – had broken the last propof his shattered health, his fierce indomitable spirit.” It may sound a prettydepressing end, but my soul would have learned much from those experiences, andthat, after all, is the point.A later reading with Judy revealed some of the previous links with my family inpast lives. We have been together in many different roles and differentcountries. Kerry had been with me when I was Anthony Bacon, and we were childrentogether in Victorian times. There was a strong link between Linda and Gareth.He had been a Tibetan monk in the incarnation before this one. Linda and I havebeen together so often “we could be here all day listing them all”, Judy said.We had been man and wife in ancient Greece, when we had undergone a mysticalmarriage. This, apparently, was when our souls pledged themselves to each otherfor a long period into the future. It involved ceremonies lasting many days inthe temple, and Judy saw a vision of us sitting on a bed of flowers in a caveabove Delphi.Linda had always seen her role in life as supporting me in my work. The tapemade clear it was much more important than that. She had come to earth with aspecial task, as had Kerry and Gareth, and she would embark on that around 1995or 1996. I had many links with my father, and the whole family was connectedthrough past-life experiences. What struck me most about the tape was the wayJudy had summed up the background and personalities of everyone so brilliantly,when she knew little or nothing about them, except for myself.I went to see her at her cottage in Dorset. We talked of matters spiritualbefore we tried to ease some of those past lives from the memory of the soulthrough to the conscious brain. What happened to us in previous incarnations canaffect our health and attitudes in this one, and going back to them throughvarious techniques can lay the ghost to rest, and the health and emotionalproblems related to a past life disappear.In the spiritual world beyond our sight, every thought and deed of everylife-form is recorded on a fine substance known at the Akashic Records. All ofus, our eternal spirit-souls that is, have our own unique vibrations, ourspiritual fingerprints, and they are the means of recording what we do. This iswhat the Bible means when it talks of the Book of Life being opened on JudgmentDay. The Akashic Records are this Book of Life. Past life memories are also heldby the soul.Our personal earth-life vibration is, it would appear, imprinted upon us atbirth. What form it takes is decided by the positions of the planets at themoment we are born – a moment we have chosen. Throughout our lives we areaffected by the way our vibrations relate to those created by the planetarymovements, and so you have astrology. Souls are trying very hard to be born at acertain time to receive a vibration suitable for the life they wish to lead. Thetiming is no accident.Judy Hall has a method which puts you into very deep meditation, although youare fully conscious and can stop at any time. The meditation is so deep that youcan actually ‘tune in’ to your Akashic Record or soul-memories, and it willrelease details of past lives, all of which are stored there. But as I havesaid, you are only allowed the knowledge you need for your development at thattime.I wasn’t given any awareness of the past when I was with Judy. Instead I had apain in my abdomen which came and went all the way through. It was like a knifegoing in. At the start I felt the ‘spider’s web’ across my face again, with thesensation along my hairline of the web being pressed down. I lost all sense oftime. I thought it was about an hour I was lying there – it was more than three.It was quite unlike anything I had experienced before. What I’ll never forget,though, were my hands. They first turned so cold that I lost feeling in them.Then they began to burn, almost to the point of being unbearable. Judy sat thereobserving me, and she had seen through her psychic vision that my body-energies,the aura that surrounds the physical body, were being rearranged. Several timesduring those three hours she had a vision of evolved beings having a discussion.It was a sort of Star Trek scene: they all had tiny waists and wore the sameuniform. Rank was denoted by the shape of the hairstyle. I know it is hard tobelieve after the way we have been conditioned, but there we are – I can onlytell you what happened. To disbelieve is not to disprove, as they say.The story had hardly begun, and yet my life and perceptions were alreadychanging dramatically. I knew that for some reason I had a job to do in thislifetime that would, in conjunction with other events and other people, changethe world forever. I felt a bit isolated and lonely with the knowledge I hadbeen given, but the Grand Plan was soon to take care of that.It was time, as Wang said, to hold hands."},{"pageContent":"3Letters from the GodsThe events of the next few weeks were to reveal much about the nature of theproblem facing the Earth and, by definition, the whole of humanity. I was alsoto realise why the geological upheavals were necessary.It relates to the Earth’s energy-system. Conventional science does not acceptthat this even exists, but science is mistaken. I was led to a book about theseenergies, and once I had the basic knowledge, I was subsequently guided to manypsychics who were receiving messages about this energy-system. The energy flowsfrom a central source – the Godhead – and throughout the universe on a giantinterconnecting grid that links up every planet and star. Each planet is apulse-point that sends the energy on to the next one and so on. The stars do thesame. The energy is referred to in the Bible and all the psychic communicationsas the Holy Spirit, the Christ Spirit or, most often, the Light.This energy, the life-force of Creation, is carried across the Earth on whatsome people call ley lines. The ancients rightly believed that these lines werethe Earth’s life-blood, and made the land fertile. They are often marked by oldtracks walked by people for thousands of years, though these have disappearedrapidly under new roads and developments. Birds use these lines to guide themwhen they migrate, and all animals are tuned into them. Every country has aversion of ley lines. The ancient Chinese knew them as dragon lines, and to thisday people have called geomancers, whose task it is to make the energy flow asefficiently as possible. Many energy-lines are set out with perfect symmetry,according to the laws of geometry and numerology. Pyramids and domes were builtbecause their shapes interact with the energy. The Great Pyramid at Giza is akey point in the whole system.I realised that ancient ceremonies and stone circles were not designed toworship false gods. The circles are power points that boosted and distributedthe energy across the land, and the ceremonies involved walking, dancing andsinging, in a way that stimulated the energy and charged it up. In 1921, a mancalled Alfred Watkins was enjoying the view from the top of a hill inHerefordshire when suddenly he saw before his eyes, not the landscape of the1920s but that of ancient England. He could see a network of lines linking allthe old stones, crosses, moats, holy wells, special trees with legends attached,and churches on pre-Christian sites. These were all in direct alignment witheach other, and they linked up in the same fashion with beacon hills andmountain tops. After this vision, he began to investigate ley-lines, and foundthey matched up perfectly with what he had seen. He published his findings in abook, The Old Straight Track. Energy-lines, however, do not necessarily have tobe straight. They can be created anywhere that people or animals walk regularly,because we are all made up of energy fields, and so we can form energy-lines ifwe walk the same way often enough. They can also be created by thought.The messages coming through from many sources explained how this energy-systemwas in urgent need of restoration. If it wasn’t restored, the earth would die,and the universe would suffer a catastrophe as the energy-grid was broken. Whenpeople walked everywhere and made pilgrimages down the long-distance paths, asin Pilgrim’s Progress, the movement stimulated the energy. In doing so thewalkers charged themselves with the life-force. Now we use cars and are coveringmore of the earth with concrete and tarmac, and this interchange between people,earth and energy cannot take place as it should. More than that, cars,electricity pylons, broadcasting transmitters and other things are causing greatdamage to the natural energy-lines which have survived.The spirit realms, and beings from other planets and star systems are now tryingto restore the flow of energy before it is too late. They are working withhumans in every country to patch up the old energy-grid around the Earth andbuild a new one ready for the more powerful energies that are being beamed tothe planet. When the moment is right the energy will be switched from one systemto the other. The major problem has been the destructive thoughts for whichhumanity has become famous throughout the universe. I mean the thoughts ofhatred, anger, fear, aggression, sadness, resentment, depression, and so on. Iwill use the words dark or darkness to describe these thoughts and the energythey create. Some people call them negative, but this has several meanings, notall of them bad, and can cause confusion. Anyway, darkness sums up their effectand contrasts them clearly with the Light.The Earth’s energy-system can be blocked or diminished by dark emotions andevents. All our thoughts create energy-fields, and the vibrations caused bybloodshed, battles and suffering in all its forms can produce a sort of screenthrough which the Earth’s energy cannot pass – at least not in the way itshould. When you consider the thoughts of anger, fear, hatred and resentmentwhich have been produced over the centuries, it is not hard to understand whythe energy-system is in such disarray.The Earth is a living, breathing, spiritual being, and her sadness at the damageand destruction caused by human activity has also produced much dark energy.This has blocked many of the energy-lines within the Earth and has createdenormous dangers. Some areas of the planet are not absorbing enough of thelife-force, and they are dying; while inside the Earth, energy is building up asits means of escape is closed off by shields of darkness. The Earth would simplyexplode if this situation was left unchecked, and relieving this pressure is onereason why the earthquakes and volcanoes must come.Spirit messages made it obvious even at this stage that ancient knowledge aboutenergy and reincarnation and karma have been carried by certain souls throughthe centuries, in peoples and movements such as the early Christians, theChaldeans, Gnostics, Cathars and Druids, and the Essenes, authors of the DeadSea Scrolls. Jesus of Nazareth studied with the Essenes during some of the‘lost’ years in the Gospels, before he was baptised by John the Baptist andbegan the work the Bible describes.Old Druid sites often came up in these early months of my tutelage. The Druidswere the priestly, learned class of the Celts, a people of ancient Europe whocame to Britain around 500 BC. They too believed in reincarnation and wereguardians of the energy-system. The Druidic religion diminished under theRomans, and all but disappeared by AD 500. Many of the souls which carried theancient knowledge through the centuries have apparently reincarnated in ourgeneration to play a part in bringing back the old wisdom, and to ease thetransition to the new tomorrow.This information began to emerge after I met someone living at Kenilworth inWarwickshire. I had been asked to speak at the opening of a Green Show at theNational Exhibition Centre near Birmingham, and I took the chance to visit thestand of Kindred Spirit, a magazine for people interested in mystical andspiritual matters. The conversation turned to earthquakes, and I was told that awoman who was getting spirit communications about earthquakes had visited thestand, and was wondering what to do with these messages. It turned out that thewoman had not, at that stage, received any messages about earthquakes – she hadreceived her first message on the day of an earthquake. But thatmisunderstanding was essential to grab my attention. The woman had left heraddress with Kindred Spirit, and I went to see her. It was clear within a fewminutes that we were meant to meet.She was receiving what mediums call automatic writing. This is when a spiritsends thought forms into the subconscious, and these are processed by thephysical brain to produce written words. I will refer to the woman only as ‘thesource’. She was one of a growing number of people that were being contactedwith messages relevant to this book and The Plan in general. On the day of theBritish earthquake she was sitting at the typewriter in her study when she felta tremendous push in the back. Her heavy wooden chair tipped forward and shewas, as she put it, “catapulted onto the keyboard”. It was as if someone hadgrabbed the chair and pushed it from behind. She stood up and called out butthere was only silence. She checked the rest of the house and found no one. Whatwas most strange was an overwhelming feeling that she was being urged to dosomething. She had experienced some psychic phenomena in the past and had heardof automatic writing. As the incident involved a typewriter, maybe she was beingasked to write something. She decided to sit at the desk and write whatever cameinto her mind. The first sentence was already forming and after that anotherword came, then another. Slowly the words built up, and this is what they said:Only good will come from the written word that I write here. The spirit of treesand the green earth surrounds me. On the plain a single tree tells a story Ican’t quite remember. The sound of men and horses survive in the echo of thepast. All these voices are there to be heard. They come in silence filling thevalley with the strength of their numbers. There has been bloodshed. Also themystery of words kept inside great books in the care of hooded men. The wordsare to be unravelled, the story told. There is fear of destruction, a secretsomewhere which holds together this place. Here there was quiet, now it istrampled upon.Somewhere there is a Light that must continue to shine. Destruction,destruction. Hold fast to the truth that walks the way, follow the paths thatlead to the hills, wash in the water over the stones. Turn them until the soundis made. There will be power to guide the feet along the tracks, beacons make aline. They will end in high places, for it is the looking down on Creation thatwill preserve all things. I am the Way, the Truth and the Light. Follow thatLight, touch as you pass. Look to the ripples, they must be counted. There thefeet have made marks and the energy lives. It can be stroked. Look into the Sunwith closed eyes. Let the tree branches carry the Light in different directions.This is the old way in the hills. The rocks remember where the fires burned. Themen must walk if it is to be saved. Follow the paths. The energy must flowagain. Take care. Carry the rock.She didn’t understand these words, nor where they came from, but Diane, apsychic friend, said she had been to a meeting a few days earlier at which a manhad talked about ley-lines and earth energies. She thought the writing could beconnected with these. It was. The source contacted the man and they arranged tomeet. He arrived with a friend called John; both men are extremely psychic. Thethree of them agreed that at least part of the message was about energy-linesblocked in Kenilworth, which had long been an important energy site. This wasrecognised by Queen Elizabeth I, who was told of the energysystem by her Celticpredecessors, the Tudors, and a series of sluices and waterways were built atKenilworth Castle. This is significant because water carries the energy.John said Kenilworth was on a main energy-line through England, and psychicmessages revealed that the energy was blocked at a point just downstream fromthe castle. This was where the bodies had been heaped after a battle in the 13thcentury, and the dark energy thus produced had caused the blockage. Theyvisualised the energy flowing again through that area and the line was cleared.It may sound strange that you can do this without even visiting the site, butthe energy-fields created by thought can travel anywhere instantly. This is howtelepathy works. Good thoughts will always disperse dark ones if they areprojected strongly enough, and in this way the screens of darkness can bebroken. I should stress, however, that not every block can be erased from afar.Some sites must be walked or visited by people gifted with certain energies orenergy-patterns.More automatic writing followed. A group of people were gathered together by thesource and the messages sent them off to many places around the Heart ofEngland. They were led to stone circles and ley-lines which had to be cleared.The locations were not normally mentioned by name, but only described. Therewere many remarkable incidents. One message had said: “On the hill-top I willwait where the dancers (a stone circle) move, and look back over the valley tosee the signs that I have marked for you”. When they arrived at that spot on adull, dark day with no sign of the sun, a shaft of sunlight pierced the cloudcover and illuminated a church down in the valley. The church, it transpired,marked the point on a ley-line where the energy was not flowing correctly.Another time the source went to a place which the writing called the Moon Grove,a Druid site. We know it by another name. She found at least eight blackbirdfeathers speared into the ground so firmly she struggled to pull them out. Themessage had said: “The feathers will become spears”.The most memorable event for the Kenilworth Group came at the Moon Grove. Themessage had said:Come again to the Moon Grove and begin the work we have shown. Wait until theMoon is full and you have seven people, and the words will come. Listen to myvoice as the sun sets and the moon begins her journey across the sky. The ashtree stands sentinel, and the water must run over your feet before you begin.Say the prayers that are in your hearts, and the pendulum will show you theplace where you must worship the Sun and the Moon Goddess. The oak leaves are tobe held as I have told you before. They hold the memories of Albion and cannotbe forgotten.The Druids held the oak tree to be sacred, and Albion is an ancient name forEngland. The pendulum refers to dowsing: this is when you hold a pendulum, andit responds to questions by swinging one way or the other, to indicate yes orno. It can identify energy-lines, and the more it swings the more powerful theenergy. The pendulum is also a means for the spirit world to communicate on ayes or no basis. It has many uses, but accuracy can vary greatly depending onthe skill or psychic ability of the person involved. I had been taught how todowse a few months before this all started, by a friend who used the pendulumfor diagnosis in his alternative healing practice.The source had no problems getting together the seven people required by themessage. “They just sort of arrived”, she said. There was herself, her friendDiane, their husbands, two friends, Michael and Helen, plus Deborah Shaw, whohad just returned from Canada for a short stay in Kenilworth, where she had oncelived. She had begun to have regular psychic experiences, and her place in thegroup was confirmed when she said that every time she opened one of her books itfell open at a page about a stone circle which the group had been working on. Ihad a specific message from the source that I had to meet Deborah Shaw, and wewere to work closely together a few months later when she was back in Canada.The seven who went to the Moon Grove appeared to be linked by past lives inancient Sumer – between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates in what is modern-dayIraq. They had all been either Chaldeans or Akkadians – or at least thecommunications pointed that way.At the Moon Grove there is a pool and a stream. The source walked through thestream as instructed, and stood on a stone by a thorn tree. She had an oak twigin each hand. The other six stood on the opposite side of the stream and waitedfor the moment to arrive. The sun set at 8.36pm, and the moon rose at 8.40. At8.36pm precisely one great ripple spread itself across the pool. The water hadpreviously been perfectly still.The night before, the source had spoken to a psychic friend, and he had pickedup the words she had to say: “Solache, maker and bender of light, hear my words.Bend my golden light into trust (or truth, it wasn’t clear), redeeming one”. Sherepeated these words as she stood on the stone. She held up the oak branches, asan earlier message had instructed, and she felt a powerful force drop throughher from head to foot. As this happened her eyelids were pushed down. Her bodyhad been used to convert energy from above into a form the Earth could absorb.It came in through the top of her head and out through her feet, via her ownenergy pattern.As she opened her eyes another big ripple swept across the water. They all couldalso hear the sound of fish breaking the surface of the water in the gatheringdarkness. The other six now felt they should walk to the top of the hill, andthere they found hundreds of sheep walking towards them in almost regimentedrows. The sheep made no sound, not one baa-a. Part of the Moon Grove message hadsaid: “The beasts will acknowledge you in silence”. As the Moon came up everysingle sheep turned to look intently in its direction.When the six returned to the pool, they found the water, once so still, bubblingand gurgling out into the stream. Massive ripples swept across the pool as fishleapt out of the water. All was a cascade of movement, sound, and life. It wasan amazing sight and astonished those in the group who had been sceptical. Inthe car home, two of the number said they’d heard singing or chanting in thesame spot at the Grove, and Diane said she’d had a vision of men in hooded whitecloaks at the same place. The communications had spoken of “the mystery of wordskept inside great books in the care of hooded men …Men in white cloaks who havecarried the knowledge …and sing the song you have heard since the youth time.”This ‘youth time’ referred to young souls, not children in this life. My messagefrom Wang Yee Lee, which said: “He was chosen as a youngster for his courage”had the same meaning. This plan for the great changes on Earth was arranged, andthe personnel selected, many thousands of years ago. The meaning of ‘sing thesongs’ will become clear soon.The event at the Moon Grove is only one of countless incidents all over theworld as Operation-Change-the-Earth enters its final stages. The author of theKenilworth Letters, a being called Ashad, spoke often of following the sun toother time zones, where others heard his words. One communication said: “Thereare others who hear our commands and are ready for the time when they must speak(for instance, when this book is published). Together you will be a mighty army,and you must speak with a loud voice for all the nations of the world to hear.”I was also being mentioned in some of the writing – as with “The man must writethe book and all will then be known”, and, “The man who writes the book willbegin it all”, but what was most interesting to me was the confirmation of themessages I was getting from elsewhere. The rivers they speak of are theley-lines, and the water-channels which carry energy across and through theEarth:The world is changing, and the North will become South and the East, West. So ithas been commanded since the beginning of all time. It will happen as the leavesfall from the trees and the water winds through the valley. We shall be replacedby the new gods (as one age is replaced by another), but our time has not yetcome and all must be left undisturbed for the new masters.There is much to be done and I must speak through you to the people who know ofthe Word. There is a darkness that will come in a lifetime and will spread overall things. The Light will be dimmed, but you have the power to preserve thefruits of the Earth. There is a blight across the land, and the Earth is dyingwithout the prayers. You are the people of the memory who know of the old ways…there are so few left, and the work must be done. In the beginning we knew theshape of things to come, but much has been changed, and man has worked his magicin the wrong way.The old ways are reviled, and men with forked tongues seek only wealth and haveno thought for the generations that are to come. We must protect their right,and the sword (the new, more powerful energies) must flash again across ourkingdom… The sword shall enter in the kingdom of the Brigantes (an ancient tribewhich once controlled most of Northern England).We shall come in the thunder, and the wind shall blow across the land. The seawill rise and there is much to be cleansed. All men must turn again to theirtrue gods. Each knows his line and the names he must worship if the world is tobe saved.There are false gods in the land, and men with loud voices listen not to thewords of their fathers. They are no longer listening to the seasons, but musttry to change all things themselves. We are the gods and it is not for man toaccomplish our work. Know that we must take command and put right those thingsthat have been misarranged.There have been many prophets, but the warnings have gone unheeded. We speak,and the land becomes silent waiting for the work to begin, but the men must movefrom the water for the land will be covered by the sea, and it must flow up thevalleys. Many will be lost if they do not heed our warnings.Men have not understood what is the nature of life on Earth. Much has beenforgotten, and wisdom has taken the wrong path. You must return to the knowledgeof your forefathers, or there will be a rent in the universe and the Light willgo out. Know that we mean only kindness to all men, and as before we come onlywhen the need is very great. There are still good things to be found on Earthand many good words spoken. But from many mouths there is only anger andbitterness and dissatisfaction at the life that was provided.The Earth, has become weak under the burden placed upon her and the power mustflow again. Everything has been planned and will come to pass as we say. For ourtask has been to preserve the Earth from its centre where the fire lives. Theuniverse needs the life the Earth brings forth, and the Whole must be preserved.It is not for you alone that we do this work. There has always been an order inthe way the planets have been governed. Man has not understood the linkageswhich bind everything together.A much later communication went into more detail about what happens in thecentre of the Earth:The fire which is at the very heart of your world needs to be replenished afterperiods of time. This is because the energy it transmutes, and which holds alllife together, can only reproduce itself for a certain period. The rocks, whichare at the Earth’s core, spread in different directions and are layered in sucha way that the heat can continuously smoulder without spreading outward andcrumbling the Earth from the inside.At this time, many changes are occurring in the Earth’s core and the volcanoeswill soon erupt as the pressure becomes unsafe within the surface. You shouldlook to the East for the first signs. The earthquake cycle has begun and manywill be triggered by the movement that has already occurred.The words could hardly have been clearer. The Earth faced a period of enormouschange, and if this ‘cleansing’ did not happen the universe would suffer acatastrophe of its own. This was no dream or illusion I was involved in here.This was for real.One thing that was apparent almost from the start was the importance of sound.This was emphasised when the Kenilworth source was led to a book called theShrine of Wisdom which fell into her hands in a shop selling old books. It was acollection of journals of the same name published in the 1920s. The journalswere, said the book, “A quarterly devoted to synthetic philosophy, religion, andmysticism”. There was a section about special words carried through the ages bymembers of the ancient cultures, including the Celts, Greeks, Egyptians,Chinese, Sumerians and Chaldeans. All these words begin with ‘A’, and the soundthey make stimulates, tunes up, one chord or frequency of the energy. The wordshave to be spoken with the hands across the nose and mouth; this forms a chamberin which the sound can resonate.What is produced by some words is not unlike the sounds made by Aborigines inAustralia. You put your hands together in front of you in the classicsaying-your-prayers position and then bring them back to cover your face,covering your nose and mouth with your thumbs on your cheeks. “It has been toolong since the prayers have been spoken”, and these were the prayers it wastalking about. It was the same with “Sing the songs you have sung since theyouth time”. Everyone involved in The Plan knew of this sound system of wordswhen our souls lived in the ancient civilisations, and the words we used thenhave been given to us to say again today, to tune up the energy. Another pieceof automatic writing said: “Play on the strings with your words and the Lightwill be enhanced”. The other kind of prayers, by the way, the kind we say inchurch, are powerful thought-forms which are picked up by the spirit realms andacted upon or otherwise on their merit.Much can be explained by the use and effects of sound which, if projected to theright frequency, can manifest and demanifest rocks, cause things to levitate,and make apparently impregnable structures crumble. The age-old questions of howStonehenge or the pyramids were built and what made the walls of Jericho cometumbling down, can now be potentially answered – the use of sound. Humanity hasforgotten this wisdom to its cost.Many strange and wonderful things were happening to me as I was led from placeto place gathering knowledge. I went with the Kenilworth source to a stonecircle to have my own energy charged up, and we arranged to meet her psychicfriend, Diane, at a hotel nearby. After an hour she still hadn’t turned up andwe had to leave. The following day the source rang to say she had solved themystery of the missing Diane. There had been a psychic message to say Ishouldn’t meet her yet. Diane had been in the hotel lounge in the right place atexactly the same time we were there and we walked the length of the lounge onseveral occasions in the course of that hour. But Diane had not seen us and wehad not seen her.Another time I was on holiday in Venice when I visited an island called Burano,which is famous for its lace-making. I wandered into the church of San Martinoand stood looking up at a large painting of Christ. As I looked, the pictureturned black and moved around before my eyes. Only the face of Christ was still.Suddenly I felt a sensation I can only describe as someone pushing a pneumaticdrill into the top of my head. I gripped the pew I was standing beside and mybody vibrated from the top of my head to the base of my spine as somethingseemed to go through me. It lasted for maybe half a minute, and when it stoppedmy eyes focused again and the painting went back to normal. Months later I wastold that this had been the moment I received a gift of energy from one of theMasters of this planetary system. The energy was to give me strength andcourage, a determination to seek the truth, and the confidence that I would findit.We were all getting tremendous help and support from the spirit beings who werecontrolling and co-ordinating The Plan. Whatever we did, they had an expert inthat field to offer expertise and guidance. This book is an example of that. Atanother visit to Betty Shine, a message told me to start writing and theinformation would be given to me: “They’re giving me the name of the man whowill be working with you”, Betty said. “Paul… Paul, no, I can’t get it… they’llgive it to me again in a minute.” A short silence followed. “Paul Branston, no,Branton… that’s his name, Paul Branton – they say you will not have heard ofhim, but he is very spiritual and a wonderful writer. He will help you shape thebook”. She added: “They are telling me to go to my bookcase and I will find abook he has written. Well, that’s a load of rubbish for a start!”Betty was moving to another house, and only a few books she had never got aroundto reading remained at this one. She left the room, certain the information waswrong. “You will never believe it”, she said as she returned. “I bought thisbook with five others a year ago, and I’ve never read it. I forgot I had it.”She held up the book: The Quest – Vol II, The Notebooks of Paul Brunton. He wasan American who wrote widely on spiritual matters before his death in 1981.Betty also told me it would be better if I left the Isle of Wight before thewinter because I would soon be travelling almost constantly, and living on anisland would make my travel arrangements more difficult and complicated. Icouldn’t move that quickly, but her words proved to be perfectly correct.My many journeys toward enlightenment were soon to begin."},{"pageContent":"4The Grand DesignLearning more than I ever had before about the true nature of life was awondrous and humbling experience. The universe is one big brotherhood andsisterhood of souls. There is no division. All is one and one is all.Over the months I was able to piece together the basic structure within which weall live. This was done either by direct communications or by reading books orparts of books, which were subsequently confirmed as basically accurate bydirect communications.Every form of life is created by the same light-energy, whatever we may be. Weare governed by the same laws, and so we conform to the same basic spiritualdesign, albeit with differences in detail. Every form, including the Godhead,has two opposite poles, positive-negative or male-female, whichever you preferto call them. We are all searching for the perfect balance between these forces,and when we find this harmony we are at one with the Creator. We are home again.What we call evil is the manifestation of a soul considerably out of balance –evil is disharmony of the soul. Hell is not a place, but a state of mind. Bothpoles are necessary to find the perfection of balance which leads us to what theBible calls heaven. Again, heaven is not a place, but a state of mind, a stateof being.It is by experiencing too much negative and too much positive that we find thepoint of balance between them. Evil is when this experience is taken toextremes. All of creation is constantly seeking the neutral point betweenconflicting forces. In the modern world the masculine polarity has been dominantat the expense of the caring, compassionate, receptive, feminine. It has beengrab-and-take rather than help-and-give. The next age will seek to redress thatimbalance. Male and female polarities, I should point out, are within us all, itis not a man-woman division.It is a cosmic law that when two forces, male-female, positive-negative, unite,a third force is created. This could be where the concept of the religiousTrinity originates, the Father-Mother-Son or, in Western religions where thefeminine has been discarded, the Father-Son-Holy Spirit. It is the interplaybetween the positive and negative poles of each entity that keeps energyvibrating at a particular rhythm and sets one vibration apart from another. Thecloser the two poles are to harmony the quicker the vibration, and this is howwe progress up the ladder of frequencies to the Godhead. The only differencebetween lifeforms or objects in terms of how they appear is the speed at whichthe energy is vibrating and their level of evolution. We may see a ‘solid’shape, but in fact it is not solid. Nothing is. Our own science has acknowledgedthat what we think is solid is really energy vibrating at a certain speed. Theslower it vibrates, the denser the form appears. The faster it vibrates, themore transparent it looks, until the vibrations are too quick for our physicaleyes to see.Radio waves are invisible to us for this very reason. This is also why there areso many reports of people seeing UFOs which suddenly ‘disappear’. What the UFOshave done is switch frequencies from one we can see to one we cannot. Energy andphysical matter are the same substance. Matter is energy vibrating slowly, andwhen matter is burned or decays the process quickens the vibrations and itbreaks down into pure energy again. It really is true to talk of the rhythm oflife: that is an excellent description of these principles.There is One Consciousness in Creation and we are all aspects of thatConsciousness. I have described us as like droplets of water in an ocean, allpart of the same whole. This whole, however, is not all at the same level ofevolution and development. This One Consciousness is made up of endless levelsof awareness and understanding. These are the frequencies of life I talk about.They are frequencies of consciousness. At the highest level, what I call theGodhead or the Ultimate, is the sum total of Creation’s wisdom, love, andunderstanding. The further down the frequencies you go, the further you are awayfrom that state-of-the-art consciousness.These frequencies of life are not stacked on top of each other like a chest ofdrawers, they share the same space. Wherever you are reading this book willcontain in the space you are occupying all the frequencies in Creation,including the Ultimate or Godhead.We can’t see these other levels because they are vibrating at a speed beyond therange our eyes and physically-attuned brains can tune into, although mediums andsensitives can quicken their own rate of vibration enough to contact otherdimensions or ‘frequencies’. This is why they see or hear spirits and others donot. It is also possible for souls on other planes to lower their vibrationsenough to be seen as a transparent outline, sometimes more, in our physicalworld. On these occasions we see them as ghosts. They can walk through wallsbecause there is a vast difference between their frequency and that of the wall,just as radio waves can pass through our houses to reach the transistor. Ontheir own level these souls look perfectly solid to each other because they areoperating within the same frequency range.Each higher plane and sub-plane of frequency is more wonderful than the onebelow as we get closer and closer to the perfect balance of peace, love, will,knowledge and wisdom that is our ultimate destiny. The astral plane is thenearest to the physical, and a communication from a consciousness calledAttarro, of whom much more later, gave us some idea of what life is like there:I want to tell you of the beauty of the astral levels. The beauty is beyondexplanation. The cleanliness of our air is refreshing and crystal clear. Thegreenness of our trees is of hues humans could not yet distinguish. We visitchurches of resounding reverence, walk in marble streets of harmony wherever westep. The learning process is everlasting. We meet and exchange our knowledgefrom all existences to gain perspective on God’s plan. Earth, so far away (infrequency), yet so near, is rocking the balance, not only of the cosmos, but ofthe astral plane, and we seek to gain balance and harmonise your world.It is to the astral plane I was told that we go when the physical body dies.Depending on our spiritual evolution, we either stay there until our next earthlife or move through to a higher plane. People who have died and been broughtback to life recall seeing a light at the end of a tunnel at the point of death.As they reach the light they see an exquisite place of incredible beauty andamazing colours where they meet ‘dead’ friends and relatives. What they havedone is visit the astral plane before returning to the physical body. The onlydifference between that and death is that when we die we stay there. Theconsciousness of people in a coma moves to the astral plane while they decide ifthey wish to continue their physical life or stay where they are. If they decideto come back they emerge from the coma, if they decide not to come back they‘die’.On the astral and all levels of life, other than the physical, we take ournourishment from the energy around us, and everything else we need we produce bythought. You think it and it appears before you. This applies also to yourappearance. You look how you need to look. To think, we wear black and gothrough agonies when our loved ones die, and yet all they have done is move onto a place of breathtaking magnificence where we will eventually join them! Weare not that far from the day when funerals will be joyous affairs, acelebration that a soul has completed a set of lessons and has returned to thenonphysical world.Another fundamental difference between the physical and non-physical planes istime. They have no such thing as time in the way we measure it. Only on earthare we obsessed with the clock and make such a great distinction between past,present and future. On the spirit-planes all three are happening at once andthey come together in the Now. This is a state of being which is virtuallyimpossible for our physical brains to comprehend at this stage of our evolution,and I mention it only in passing. Incidentally, this difference in the conceptof time makes it very difficult for spiritual guides to tell us precisely whenevents will occur, and you should keep this in mind, when I mention specificdates.The human being incarnated on earth has a constant link with the astral, mental,spiritual and soul planes. Part of us permanently exists there during an earthlife. The human entity is made up of many bodies, not just the physical one wesee. First there is the real us, the spirit-soul. This takes on a spiritualbody, a mental body, or mind, and an astral or emotional body, which, obviously,is the source of the person’s emotional responses. The more evolved the soul,the more adeptly it will manage the emotions and personality of the person. Theless evolved souls are usually dominated by their other bodies and so allowemotion and the limited perspective of the physical brain to rule them. It isall part of the learning process.Throughout our lives on earth, while the physical body operates on the physicalfrequency which we can see, all the other bodies operate on their ownfrequencies, which we can’t see. The soul can move its consciousness from onebody to another and that is all that happens in physical death. Consciousness isremoved from the physical body.In fact, this happens to us when we sleep. Every night our consciousness movesto the astral body and we travel around the astral plane. We meet loved ones whohave died, and the more evolved will spend time with spiritual teachers ordiscuss special tasks we may be involved in on earth. Most people don’t rememberthe details of this when they awake, but these travels are one reason for ourdreams. They usually appear as weird or amazing dreams. This is the physicalbrain trying to make sense of scenes it cannot comprehend. During these nightlytravels the astral body is connected to the physical by a thin thread of energyand when we show signs of waking the astral body returns instantly. Often peoplewill have a premonition that someone has died, because their astral bodies havemet on one of these occasions.The spirit-soul and its non-physical bodies incarnate in the womb and take on aphysical shell. This shell is, itself, made up of two bodies, the one we see andanother called the etheric. This organises the growth and development of thephysical body. The human entity, as we have seen, is a series of bodies orenergy-fields, and the etheric is the master organising-field. DNA, to whichmedical science has given a great deal of attention, carries the genetic codewhich explains to the individual cells how to do their job and what kind of cellthey will be, but the etheric body holds the information about where that cellshould go and what it should do on a second-by-second basis. It is theblueprint, the template, for the physical body. The etheric field is responsiblefor growth, the physical shape, the repair of damage and injury, recovery fromillness, and so on. If you could see the etheric body around the unformedfoetus, you would see it was shaped like the body it is destined to become. Thisapplies to all things.The health and harmony of the mental and astral or emotional bodies can eithersupport, control, or disrupt this etheric organisation, because they are allenergy fields interacting with each other. This is how our mental and emotionalstates can filter through to become physical illness. When modern medicinerealises this, there will be a revolution in health care. We will at last judgeour medical success by how few people are ill and not, as now, on how many illpeople we treat. Physical illness is caused by the disruption of the ethericorganisation, and this can happen weeks, months or even years before we feelphysical discomfort. When we have found ways to test for this disruption andre-stabilise the etheric energy-field, physical illness will be reduced on aquite fantastic scale.Here lies a cure for cancer and heart disease, which are caused, like so muchillness, by the emotional and mental bodies affecting the etheric. Thisdisruption can also damage the immune system, so making us open to diseases thatwe would normally repel quite easily. We so often see a husband or wife die, orbecome very ill, soon after his or her partner has died. This is caused by theshock and grief of the loss affecting the etheric organisation, or damaging theimmune system. It has become known as ‘dying of a broken heart’. Disease isliterally what it says, dis-ease, disharmony. Of course, the mental body canalso work the other way to re-balance the etheric organisation and cure illness.This is what we call mind over matter.The etheric organisation is also prone to outside influences such aselectromagnetism, and I remember reading a report which said that those workingwith electromagnetism are much more at risk from some sorts of cancer. This isbecause the etheric body is being thrown out of balance by electromagneticinfluences, and a certain type of cancer is the result. You can explain so manythings once you accept that the etheric body exists. When people have limbsamputated they often feel as if the limb is still there, and this happensbecause the etheric body is still there in the shape of the limb. In the newage, we will understand how to stimulate the etheric body so that it will regrowlost limbs, just as some animals do today. It is the prearranged disorganisationof the etheric body which produces difficult physical karma in an earth life.This may happen in the womb, producing a deformed or handicapped baby, or it mayhappen later in the form of a heart attack, cancer, or, in my case, arthritis.The etheric body is within the overall frequency band known as the physical andcan be seen by many psychics and sensitives, but it is at the higher end of theband and is still vibrating too quickly for most people to see. Many more willhave this etheric sight, however, as new vibrations are tuned up. All ourvarious bodies come together in the aura, which surrounds the physical body, andthis provides the outer shield against unwanted energies and influences aroundus. Again, many sensitives can see this and diagnose illness by studying itscolours.The more spiritually-developed the soul, the bigger, more powerful, will be thisenergy surrounding the head and body. This is where the halo comes from inBiblical pictures. You have people depicted with a bright glow around them, orwith a thin ring over the head, with which we see them depicted so often inpaintings, statues and children’s books.All our bodies are also linked together by energy points called chakras, whichare vital to our emotional and physical health and wellbeing. Throughout ourlives we are absorbing energy, the life-force of Creation, which is all aroundus. Without this we could not exist. The chakras work with this energy, and whenthey are operating correctly they look like spinning wheels of colour. Thechakras act as booster-points for the energy (like stone circles), help todistribute the energy around the body along meridian lines (human ley-lines),and ‘step down’ the energy into a form the body can use. Chakras are vortices ofenergy which link together the levels of being.[../Images/02.jpg]The Seven ChakrasWhen the chakras are working properly and the energy-system is in harmony, weare in good health. When there is a block in a meridian or chakra caused bymental or emotional imbalances, this shows itself in physical or furtheremotional problems. Chinese acupuncture has been based on this principle ofenergy-lines and power points for thousands of years. The stainless steelneedles are placed at points along the meridian lines to rebalance and harmonisethe energy-system. Stones sited on ley-lines are there for the same reason.There are seven main chakras on each body, though there are also other powerpoints along every meridian line. The main chakras are at the base of the spine,the sex organs, solar plexus, heart, throat, forehead, and on top of the head –this last one is known as the crown chakra. Each chakra vibrates to thefrequency of a spectrum colour. They all have their individual physical andemotional responsibilities, and all are connected to the physical body throughthe glands of the endocrine system. The lower chakras are concerned witheveryday and earthly matters and the top three with overall matters and thespiritual. The heart chakra is the meeting point, the bridge of balance betweenthem.The forehead chakra is linked to the ‘third eye’ or all-seeing eye, a sort ofspiritual telescope through which we see our psychic visions and understandlife. It was a psychic projection of this eye that I could see everywhere soonafter this story began. When people talk about opening your third eye, they meanactivating your psychic powers, which we all have, though some more than others.The crown chakra is the point of entry for thought-forms from the spirit realms,which sensitives can turn into words. It is through this chakra that we tuneinto higher levels of intelligence and wisdom.So when we stand in front of a mirror we are looking at more than our physicalshape. Out of range of our eyes are the etheric body, the astral or emotional,the mental or mind, the spiritual, and the spirit-soul. Each of them isoperating in its own plane of existence, while making up the physical entity forthe short stay on Earth. The laws of life are this: our outer body must alwaysbe vibrating at the frequency of the plane we are working on, and we must carrywithin us bodies from all the other planes that separate the outer body from thesoul – that is, the soul could not operate in a physical body without theastral, mental and spiritual bodies. We progress up the frequencies byquickening the vibration of the soul, and we do that by the quality of ourthoughts, actions, love, wisdom and understanding. Extreme negative emotions ifnot balanced by positive can create an imbalance which lowers the vibratorystate and causes us to fall down the frequencies of consciousness.What I have described in relation to the human entity is the Grand Design forall forms of life, including the planet. The Earth, too, is a soul that takes onan emotional, mental, spiritual and etheric body for its incarnation into thephysical body which we live on. The etheric body of the earth carries theblueprint to organise, repair, balance and harmonise the physical, in responseto natural events or human activities which promote imbalance and disharmony.This etheric organisation is better known to us as the laws of nature. Someenvironmentalists call it Gaia, named after the Greek Goddess of the Earth.The universe is based throughout on the law of as above, so below. Everythingconforms to the same basic design, everything is a microcosm of the whole.Individual countries have a consciousness to guide them, and so do planets,solar systems, cosmic systems and so on. There is truly one grand design behindeverything.This is extremely significant for those of us on the Earth today. If the healthof our own emotional and mental bodies affects the etheric blueprint, andeventually shows itself in physical disease, then exactly the same happens tothe Earth. If her mental and emotional state is out of balance then her ethericorganisation will be disrupted, and physical manifestations of this will occur.So much of the environmental mayhem we see in the world is the result of theEarth-spirits’ emotional and mental turmoil caused by human activity, and Iunderstand that one of my main jobs, apart from writing books, is to try, withothers, to stabilise and strengthen the earth’s emotional and mental state. Ifshe is upset then we take the consequences, and I know that after the wayhumanity has treated her for so long she is currently having serious mental andemotional problems. She needs our help – and fast."},{"pageContent":"5Spirit of the StonesI was sent on many travels around England and Wales clearing energy-blockages,charging up energy-centres, and learning about the powers of the mineral kingdom– what most people look upon as dead rock.I went on one trip with John, the psychic who went to see the Kenilworth sourceafter her first communication. Our destination was Wales, where we were to meetJoan, who was also working on the energy-system. On the way to see her, we weresent by a psychic message to find two stones buried on a hillside somewhere onthe England-Wales border. John dowsed the map to establish approximately wherethe stones were, and we parked the car at the end of a narrow road whicheventually became a rough track.It was a magical place. As we walked, the energy was quite the most powerful Ihad felt. Both of us were struggling to put one foot in front of the other. Thependulum led us to the top of a colossal man-made hill where the views touchedyour soul. The view down across the valley and away to the hills and mountainson the darkening horizon was something that will stay with me forever. The sunwas turning a deepening gold with its journey over Britain almost complete foranother day. The scene was awesome, just awesome.We dowsed to find the right spot, a pile of stones and earth left by the Celts,and after much digging and a broken spade we found the stones we were lookingfor. The minerals have spirits just as we do, and they can store information.They can act as a sort of spiritual computer disc. The ancient peoplestransferred knowledge of the energies and the future to the spirits of thestones. It was not easy to walk away from that hilltop as night began to fall. Ifelt so much at peace in that place. The sun sparkled its patterns across thesky as we made our descent, and it was later to deliver the most spectacularsunset I had seen.The following day we were sent with Joan to three other sites on the Welshborders. The two stones we picked up the previous night were to be used at thefirst location. It was at the top of a hill in a field of sheep, and we werepresented with another magnificent panorama across the valleys. As we had drivenaway from Joan’s house, John realised he had left the stones on the roof of thecar. We found them lying in the road. One was okay, but the other had broken intwo. Yet when the instruction came through about what was to be done on thehill, we found we indeed needed three pieces of stone!We were asked to find a fourth large stone in the field, and John picked up theonly one we could see. As he did so, this big chunk of stone broke in two in hishands. The break was so clean the pieces still fitted together perfectly. Thesmall stones had to be arranged into a triangle with the big one in the middle,and the information was passed from the spirits of the three into the one. John,who can tune to the frequency of the mineral kingdom, said it sounded like thehuman equivalent of “Right, now listen, this is what you have to do!” We had tocarry the stone to a safe place where it could resonate or transmit theinformation out across the land.At the same site, Joan had to convert some energy coming into the earth fromabove, into a frequency the earth could absorb. Her body’s own energy pattern isdesigned to act as a filter for very powerful energies, and this is why she ison such a special frequency herself. She manipulates the energy with a series ofmovements, words and sounds which lower the frequency to the earth vibration anddirect it to where it must go, usually to the earth-spirit at the core. On thisoccasion there were some beings from other planets in the area, working on theearth’s etheric body, and to do that they needed the energy that Joan wasfiltering. We couldn’t see the extra-terrestrials, because they were operatingon a non-physical plane.The second location, a potato field, involved something similar, though theenergy here was even more powerful. Joan and John could actually see the energycoming down in flashes and spirals. We found the third spot among some largerocks near the summit of another hill. We stopped to have lunch. If they had acompetition for the restaurant view of the world, this would come close! Ourchairs were the rocks and our cuisine cheese sandwiches, but who cares amongthose hills and valleys! When we had finished, Joan said our bodies had beenused in some way while we were eating and chatting. As we walked back down thehill, an arrow-shaped stone caught my attention, and whenever that happens Icheck with the pendulum. Yes, it said, I should take it. That was the fourth Ihad collected in a few days. I had been led to three others from the BurtonDassett Hills in Warwickshire.A few miles down the road, as we were passing a small wood John asked me to stopthe car quickly. We had been saying how beautiful it was, and our appreciationof the countryside had tuned John into the Deva frequency. The Devas are anotherform of evolution and the name comes from a Sanskrit word meaning ‘Shining one’.They start their evolution by looking after individual plants and flowers and goon to guide groups of plants, a copse, a wood, an area of the countryside, aregion, country, planet and so on. They are called nature spirits during theirearly stages and progress to become the archangels of the Bible stories.Another aspect of the Deva evolution are the elementals, who work with theelements. Devas are spirit energy just as we are, but they might manifestthemselves in a way humans expect or understand, and this is how the legendsoriginate about fairies, gnomes, the little people, and angels with wings.The Deva communicating with John said the wood might be beautiful, but it wastough trying to keep it like that, especially with the changes they were aboutto go through. We were asked to attract some energy to the wood from theearth-spirit, and we did this by visualisation. If you imagine something ishappening, the thought-field thus created goes to work to achieve what you arevisualising. Anyway, it worked and we left one happy Deva.We thought the work was completed for the day, but on the way home John was keento visit an ancient hill-fort in the area. Alongside it we found a BBCtransmitter tower, and as we walked up the path we felt we were being pushed. Inthe end I was running. This was an important power centre and the transmitterwas playing havoc with it. Human communications systems are doing tremendousharm to the energy grid. Some automatic writing said they were also making itmore difficult to make contact across the dimensions. The human communicationsnetworks had:…caused great problems for us as they have interfered with our communicationschannels, and we cannot allow this to continue. Consequently you will find thatthere will be severe disturbances with your communications systems, as we mustclear channels to communicate with those who do our work. Your satellites arevery basic and are not tuned to the correct frequencies for the work they do.There was no doubt about the problems this transmitter was causing. You couldalmost feel the disharmony at the site. I had to walk around the outer circle ofthe fort in a clockwise direction while Joan and John cleared an energy-linegoing into the fort from the distant mountains. John was sure we had to go intothe centre of the circle, which was not easy because it was covered by a wood.We ducked and weaved our way through to find a small mound. John was contactedby another Deva, the one with overall responsibility for the power centre. Thetransmitter had knocked the energy flow off-centre, and the Deva asked us tore-balance it. I walked around the outside of the mound while Joan and John wentthrough their movements and sounds. Harmony was restored. “You are thriceblessed”, said the Deva through John, “We now have the strength to face thetransition”.On the way out I saw another stone, a lovely piece of slate, and again thependulum said I should keep it. I was later told by a communication through Johnwhat I had to do with the stones I had collected. The ones I picked up in theWarwickshire hills were for Linda, Gareth and myself, and the arrow-shaped onewas for Kerry. We would have to hold the stones assigned to us and they wouldgive us information. We would have to do this three times before we assimilatedall the knowledge, and I would know when to hand them out.I have been led to many other stones. Some are for protection from the darkforces which seek to stop our evolution to a higher spiritual consciousness,others have helped me link up with spirit guidance, and others I have to take todifferent parts of the world to help to balance and harmonise vibrations betweencertain key energy-sites. I had to make one special trip to Scotland to findfive stones on the shore of the River Tay. Three of these have to be takenacross the world and two are to help me with my own development. I hope you canappreciate that stones are not just dead matter. Joan has some amazing crystalsthat do everything but talk to you, and our relationship with the mineralkingdom will be very different in the next century and beyond.My journeys took me the length of England. I had to visit four of the sevenEnglish chakras on a main energy line across the country. The line runs from thesouth coast up through the Midlands to the northeast coast and off around theplanet to complete the circle. The seven chakras on the English section of thisley-line or meridian are at the Needles Rocks off the Isle of Wight; the IronAge fort at Uffington in Oxfordshire; Brailes Hill in Warwickshire; the site ofKenilworth Abbey; the ruins of Jervaulx Abbey in the Yorkshire Dales; the siteof Durham Cathedral, and Staple Island, one of the Farne Islands. I had to visitthe Needles, Uffington, Jervaulx and the Farne Islands.I was due to pass near Uffington soon after I was given the messages, and so Iwent there first. It was a bright, sunny day, but as I neared the fort the skybegan to cloud over. For the last few miles the sun was ahead of me, and rays ofsunshine cascaded down spotlighting the landscape as if it were some giantstage. It was a rare sight. The Uffington Fort and the ‘white horse’ carved inthe chalk on the hillside are tourist attractions, overlooking as they do thebeautiful Vale of the White Horse. The ‘fort’ is a big circle with no stones,surrounded by a bank of earth with a path along the top.I had been told I would know what to do, and I felt I should walk the circularpath in a clockwise direction. The path is walked regularly by the visitors, buta number of people around the world, including myself, it would seem, have anenergy pattern within our bodies which charges up the energies and thepower-points in a certain way. When I had completed the circuit, I felt therewas something more I had to do, and the pendulum supported that view. Iremembered my visit to the stone circle in the Midlands, when I had to spiralacross from one side to the other to re-charge my own energies. The pendulumagreed this was to be repeated here. As I moved across the centre in a turningmotion, people were still walking around the perimeter path. They were throwninto sharp silhouette against the bright horizon just below the clouds. Youwould have thought this man spiralling across the circle would have attracted atleast some interest, but no one took any notice.The next day I was going to the Needles. I intended to go in the early eveningbecause I was due to be at a local country show with the Green Party that day.But the rain poured all night and into the morning, an unusual event in a long,dry summer, and we decided not to attend. I was free to go to the Needlesearlier. This was important because I realised when I arrived that the spot Ineeded to visit would have been locked up if I had gone when originally planned.I went up on to the headland leading down to the rocks. It is always amagnificent walk. The rain had stopped by now, there was little wind, and theviews down to the famous coloured cliffs of Alum Bay and out across to themainland were superb.All was well until I’d got about half way, when the wind suddenly picked updramatically, without warning. With that the rain was back, fierce andtorrential, and I was drenched and dripping when I arrived at the NeedlesBattery, an old military base, now a museum. It is the nearest you can get tothe rocks themselves, and I went to the fence at the far end and found myselflooking out over the sea and down to the rocks and the red and white lighthouse.The Needles are three large rocks, on one of which the lighthouse stands. Thesecond is close by, and, after a gap, the third stands, near to the headland. Wehad established that this third rock was the base chakra of the line as itpassed across England. Again I had been given no instructions, only that I wouldknow what to do. Well, walking around it was out for a start! The only wordsthat came into my head were “Let there be light”. I repeated the words manytimes, adding “Let the darkness be banished from this place”.After a few minutes, the pendulum confirmed the work was completed, and I wentto the museum shop to buy a little guidebook. The Needles Battery was built as adefence against French invasion and had seen action during the last war. Manyships had also been wrecked in the bay. The pendulum spun a ‘yes’ when I askedif these events had created the negative energy I had been sent to clear. Icannot stress enough how important it is to know the consequences of darkthoughts. In the old days when there were guardians of the power-points, theywould disperse such dark energy immediately it happened, but we have forgottenor ridiculed the old wisdoms, and so the energy has built up over manycenturies.I headed to Northumberland in the far northeast of England for my next stop onthe energy-line, the chakra at Staple Island in the Farnes. These islands have along spiritual tradition. Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, was an early centre ofChristianity. St Aidan and St Cuthbert also had close associations with theFarnes in the Celtic period. The Farnes are named after a Celtic word meaning‘land’. I did not have to go to Staple Island: I could do what was necessaryfrom the mainland shore. I walked down through the dunes to the expanse of sandbetween Sea-houses and Bamburgh, looking out to some of the islands and thelegendary Longstones Lighthouse. The pendulum led me to a spot near the waterand I went through the same procedure that I did at the Needles. This time Ialso began to chant the ancient word I had been given in Kenilworth. Soon thependulum was telling me the energy blockage was dispersed and I could go.I completed my work on the line at Jervaulx Abbey in the Yorkshire Dales. Iwalked through a field of sheep to find the ruins of the Cistercian Abbey, whichdates back to 1156. I dowsed a plan of the building in the guidebook to locatethe chakra. It was an area of grass with two trees in the middle. There wereseveral people around when I arrived, but a rain shower came at the right timeand I was left alone to walk a circle around the trees. Confirmation was to comethat evening that the work at the chakras had had the desired effect.I went on from Jervaulx to meet the two psychics, John and Ian, who had alsovisited the Kenilworth source after her first communication. Ian’s girlfriendJune, another psychic, was there, too, along with the source and her husband.After a while the room became charged with energy, and as John closed his eyes avoice began to speak through him. The voice said we had been brought togetherthat night because they knew we had many questions and they would try to answerthem. The voice said there was “much shifting of gear and vibration”. It said wemust understand water with a wider perspective, and appreciate the energycarried in the water. The energies were to be changed. The three was to bereplaced by the four. The three points of the triangle would become the fourpoints of the diamond. Another kind of energy was being added which wouldtransform life on earth. “There will be so many shifts, I find it difficult toexplain them all to you”.The voice said the line through England had been cleared. “It is impossible foryou to know how urgent this work has been – beyond your comprehension”. The morewe understood about the laws of the universe and the nature of life on earth,the less physical catastrophe had to occur, said the voice (that is, goodthoughts can disperse bad ones and reduce the damage). This was why we, ashumans, had a unique gift to decide our own futures. “If you understand this,you will truly become the gods that you ape on this planet”.The voice revealed that the line we had been clearing through England continuedsouth from the Needles, through the Atlantic to South Africa, where there weremany blockages. This was no surprise when you think of the dark thought-formsproduced in that country for so long. “There is time”, said the voice, “But thetime is short”. We were asked if we would “act as crystals for centres outsideyour solar system to clear this line”. This involved all of us holding hands ina ring, and the energy being passed through us and into the line in SouthAfrica. Each of us in the ring took on the energy for a few minutes as we madeword-pictures for the rest of the group to focus on.I remember June asked us to imagine the energy flowing through the sea andhitting a wall. We then imagined the wall being dismantled and the energyflowing through. I said we should picture the whole of South Africa as abrilliant light with all its people, black and white, throwing down theirweapons and running to hug each other. At the end of each visualisation we wouldlift our hands and pass on the energy to the next person until the circle wascomplete. We were doing three things: dispersing dark thought-forms in SouthAfrica which were affecting the line, acting as a filter to reduce the frequencyof the energy to a form suitable for the earth to absorb, and projecting thatenergy by thought-fields to where it was needed. We must realise the power weall have in our possession to create and change through positive thought. Thevoice ended the communication by announcing that our efforts had succeeded.There were encouraging signs in the various messages coming in, that The Planwas working well enough to ensure that the earth would survive the changeover,if the repairs to the energy grid continued apace throughout the world. Andevery improvement to the grid is reducing the physical consequences forhumanity."},{"pageContent":"6Lord of the AgeThe symbolism of Judy Hall’s spider in the web was beginning to make sense. Iwas in the privileged position of having information coming to me from manysources, and both the volume and the sources were about to expand substantiallyas the Plan revealed its global perspective. Some of the communications camefrom the consciousness which has the awesome responsibility of easing in andguiding the new age of Aquarius. This is Rakorczy, (pronounced Rakors-ski),known by many as the Lord of Civilisation and Lord of the Seventh Ray, one ofthe energies we will soon be receiving at a much increased power.The universe is governed and guided by a massive hierarchy, and the personnel orconsciousnesses are selected purely by a soul’s stage of evolution. There arebeings who guide the cosmic, galactic, solar and planetary systems, planets,countries, and regions. Each of these systems is broken down into further levelsof organisation. At the head of our solar system is the Solar Logos, workingwith the Lords of the Rays who control the energies that affect theconsciousness and spiritual development of life-forms. These have become knownas ascended masters, and they are supported by other ascended masters, behindthe scenes, as it were. It is not a case of the higher ordering the lower likesome spiritual sergeant-major. Everyone has free will to agree or disagree.Each ascended master like Rakorczy (some spell it Rakoczy) has what is called anashram, a large group of souls on the physical and non-physical planes who workto a common purpose. A strategy is agreed before those assigned to work on earthincarnate for that life and, when the time is right, they are contacted.Gradually, the purpose of their incarnation seeps through to the brain as theknowledge is eased from their soul by experiences arranged for them by theircolleagues on the spirit planes.The Lords of the Rays are also known as The Great White Brotherhood, white beinga reference to the forces of Light as opposed to darkness. They have enormouspower and wisdom, and this is highlighted by the people they have been in theirearth lives. It is claimed by some people that the Rakorczy consciousness hashad incarnations as a ruler in the then-fertile Sahara 50,000 years ago, a highpriest in Atlantis, Joseph (the father of Jesus), the prophet Samuel, SaintAlban, Merlin (King Arthur’s ‘magician’), the monk scientist Roger Bacon, theCount Saint-Germain of France, and… Francis Bacon.Bacon was the son of Queen Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley, Lord Leicester, andwas born four months after a secret wedding. He should have been king, butElizabeth was determined to protect her status as the ‘virgin queen’ and to stopDudley getting access to her wealth and power. She threatened her son with deathif he revealed his true identity. Instead he was brought up by Sir Nicholas andLady Anne Bacon – my soul’s parents at the time – and became one of the greatestminds the Western world has produced. It was he, not Shakespeare, who wrote thefamous plays. An aspect of this soul later returned as Count Saint-Germain, theman dubbed the ‘Wonderman of Europe’, in an unsuccessful attempt to bringdemocracy peacefully to France and Europe.Rakorczy communicated with me at this stage through Joan in Wales. They had beenworking together for many years. On the first occasion I was there, Rakorczytold me something about my soul’s history. I came to earth at the start of theAtlantis civilisation and I was there much later when it was destroyed byearthquakes, volcanoes and tidal waves. I went to the planet Mercury to begin mypreparations for the task I have today. Each of my incarnations since then hasbeen designed to prepare me for this time, and it is the same for everyone elsewho has a part to play in this transformation of consciousness andunderstanding.An aspect of my soul had been a Welsh Celt, and this had been an important lifebecause, said Rakorczy, “He sang like a bird to our will”. No wonder I was somoved by those Welsh hills and valleys when I was out with Joan and John. “Hissoul revels in the ecstasy of its memories”, as the ascended master put it.Rakorczy had many other messages for me to ponder on that night, some personal,and others that would only become clear later:The diamonds can be found even in the mud – the waters wash them clean. Nuggetsof gold (philosophy) are not for you. Seek diamonds, sparkling truth, theclarity, perfection of the Word. The whirlpools of life carry you to where thediamonds are. Resonate to the perfection of the crystals. Arduous seeking is notnecessary. The path is already mapped out. You have only to follow the clues.The race against time is of some importance, but the standard of the work is ofgreater importance. If any urgency arises, you will be told. Do not worry. Learnto relax – there is always tomorrow. Every physical life needs pleasure andenjoyment. Don’t ever forget humour. We are guiding you along a set path. Youare learning according to our teaching of you. It was all organised before youincarnated.I had been concerned about my family during the upheavals because I knew wewould be apart for long periods, but Rakorczy eased my mind:No need to worry about your wife. She has a job to do. Leave her free to do itwithout any worries, any strings, any attachments, so, like a bird she can flyoff whenever she will and back to you whenever she’s able, and you to her.Your son is his own self and must go his own way. He has his path and it is noconcern of yours. You are merely his custodians while he is young. One day yourdaughter will see her star and go for it.None of you realise how much the love for the Godhead enfolds you. It cares andguides. Not one single being is left alone, uncared for. All is gathered in atthe end of the day, and not one sheep will be left in the field.True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, butit will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you receivewhether you like it or not. Ponder on anything you do not like and see if youcan see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much easier.I can report the words, yes, but the love and warmth that came over wasindescribable. We may have a lot of challenges to face, but there are somewonderful beings on our side doing all they can to help.One of Rakorczy’s team was communicating through automatic writing to asensitive in Northamptonshire. I became aware of her when she was asked by hercommunicator to pass on some messages to the Kenilworth source. I arranged tosee her, and she was taking automatic writing almost to the moment I knocked ather door. Only a minute or two earlier the messages had ended with the words “Iwill stop now as your visitor is close!”Her communicator was ‘Attarro, Avatar of the Alchemians’. An avatar is a muchevolved being, and alchemy is the transformation of the spirit to a higherunderstanding. Attarro, along with a host of beings from other stars andplanets, has come to the earth in, for the moment, a non-physical form. Onemessage explained their role:We have been waiting to reach your planet for a long time. I come to you as afriend and wish to give you the truths. I have come to understand much from myplanetary existence and I am here to protect Mother Earth. She speaks to me inlanguage that earthlings are too deaf to hear. I come in peace. My work must notbe misinterpreted, as I am here to link the puzzle pieces during the next decadeto the year 2000.Attarro confirmed the problems facing the earth as the changeover approaches,when one type of energy would be replaced by another, more powerful energy of ahigher frequency and quicker vibration. There surround many cosmoses, eachreaching out indefinitely, but linking together to form a mass which isinterlinked like a vortex of many lines. These lines are linked to the earth,and the ley-lines are like the veins of the universe, pumping blood to theplanet. We should imagine a grid system, not only transversing the earth, butalso interlacing all our planets and suns as one great electrical system.Ley-lines, as they are being destroyed, are imbalancing the cosmos, and theearth is in danger of being cut off from her heavenly brothers and sisters. Theavatars had been sent to help before the links are cut off completely and MotherEarth is lost. The Earth is a pulse point of great energy within God’s Light andworld, and God had no wish to lose this child of light and love. If the earthwere lost, so a cosmos would fold with her, and this could not be allowed tohappen.A Black Sabbath was about to arrive out of the heavens and make colossalchanges. Only by people learning to sing in harmony could they relieve theapparent dismal events. Disease and disharmony would stifle the earth over thenext decade, leaving space only for the spiritually strong and influential, andmore so the pure in heart, who would win through triumphantly. When I read thisI thought of that Biblical prediction ‘The meek shall inherit the earth’. TheAvatar said the keys to the universe were being dangled in front of the humans’third eye, which we had to open to enter the next stage, the new realisations,all the things that were due to come.Much will be learned, blood will be shed, through Man’s own fault, and the nextfew years will see such changes. Mother Earth is choking, and as she coughs andwheezes, the earth will open up through land shifts. As she cries so the landwill be flooded. Volcanoes will erupt, all to cleanse our Mother. Many new scarshave appeared on our earth. Energy lines are being broken through new roadswhich interfere with sacred ground, which was dwelt upon by our animals wholove, nurture, and trust nature, and who live totally within their natural cycleand habitat, able to understand nature’s simple messages.The time has arrived when many people would begin to feel a change in theirhearts. This is because the new vibration is beginning to take effect. Thiswould force human consciousness up to the next rung. There were manytribespeople who read nature well. They had told, and would tell again, of theimminent changes. The skies would appear darker and the equinoxes appeardifferent to that of the star scholar. What we know as a comet would be seen inthe night sky.Attarro said the Earth had great love and devotion for the human form, but shecould not survive the pressures being imposed upon her. The Earth was trying tocommunicate her knowledge to us, and this explained the mystery of the cropcircles, the strange shapes that have appeared in corn fields all over theworld. They began as a series of perfect circles, but during 1990, as this storystarted to unfold, in parts of England they became very detailed, with amazingshapes and patterns. Scientific attempts to explain this phenomenon from withinthe sphere of current knowledge convinced few, including, I suspect, many of thescientists. Attarro named the being responsible – the Earth herself. The shapeswere formed by energy from below.These rings are of great importance… the energy is transmuting, and the symbolsrise from the voice of the Earth. Just by taking shape they reach our inner eyesand memories, and for those who glance or are aware, they reach deeply to sendthe quiet messages of Mother Earth. The vibrance of these areas can be measured.Crystals laid on these areas will absorb a subtle energy and help to transmuteand communicate messages which are hidden from our memories.The symbols and the duality of nature are reaching to the heavens to transmittheir energies out to skies which are desperately breaking down their chemicalcomposition, due to pollution. Rings will spring up in many unexpected places.They may appear through rock formations and even in water through the synergy ofcurrents. The circles are to amend the lost power and unblock ley-lines whichare in trouble. The lines and the format surrounding them are like anecho-system to extend the transmission and power.We should notice, said Attarro, the vortices and angles in the crop patterns.Many of the shapes, if fitted together, would give a deeper meaning. From agreat height Creation would perceive these as a mass pattern, not individualcrop shapes. The whole area should be likened to a giant canvas which is beingetched to draw planetary influences and healing to Mother Earth, who isstruggling to keep her natural balance. The Earth is a sublime creature herself,with a consciousness that does not forget any detail, but absorbs each and everyevent, pain, joy and destruction of any of her creatures.She tries to reach us in many ways, but now is the time to communicate herdeeper level of consciousness. Her messages are simple, her language complete.It just needs decoding. Through the absorption of her symbols, so the message,like beautiful music, plays deeply within our souls.These symbols, said Attarro, had been etched many times on stone wallsthroughout civilisation, and it is not the first time they had appeared onnature’s canvas. It is necessary to rock human awareness, as it becameself-absorbed and not part of the divine family. So there you have the manyreasons for crop circles: to send out energy to help the polluted skies andozone layer, to draw in other healing energy for the Earth, to boost flaggingley-lines, and to use symbols to awaken the memory of the soul. Symbols can bevery powerful. Some symbols given to the source of this communication came witha warning only to show them to the spiritually aware, because they could bedangerous for others. It is also interesting to note that language expertsapproached for the view on the crop shapes said they looked like the symbols ofthe ancient Sumerians, which supports what Attarro said.The poor condition of the energy-system was revealed when the Avatar talkedabout Avebury, the stone circles in Wiltshire, England. I was guided there towalk the circles, and I was astonished to see a village had been built on thesite, with a road going through the middle of the circles. No wonder it is in amess. Avebury is one of the earth’s major chakras, but the Avatar said it isopen and bleeding, and a ‘whirlpool of festering pus’. Many people would need tochant to heal the damage. New stones should be laid to replace those that hadbeen lost, and existing stones had to be healed by seven healers harmonisingtogether. There had been much folly at this site, especially in the last 50years, and many sexual rites had been held in this area, which ‘feed the poolwith deeper pus’. The damage at Avebury was mirrored throughout the world asmany sacred lands were desecrated:Areas with sacrificial negativity are once again upon us with fighting andhatred. Consecrated ground is being built on, not for temples, but for pointlessmeanderings which will cascade down in a few short years. My friends, find theconsecrated ground around you, make it clean again with your efforts. Expose thecharlatans and the money-mongers and keep the grounds and the rocks pure.Attarro said the greatest enemy of the planet was that of our thoughts anddeeds. It was the dark energy we were producing in this way that was the weaponfor the Earth’s destruction. That was not to say chemical disorder is not amajor problem – it is. But much work is needed on our emotional and mentalstate.Now is the time of dramatic change, a time to unclutter our lives ofmaterialism, to give us the space we need to breath, to cleanse our thoughts andour actions…Keep your hearts pure. Joy can be as catching as anything. Go about your workwith a joyous heart, exude love and wisdom and principle. Speak the truth tothose you can listen, and even to those who do not wish to listen. The seeds oftruth will bury and in time will grow.Healing was frequently the subject of the Avatar’s letters, especially healingthrough colour, and many times the lost civilisation of Atlantis was mentioned.There would be many breakthroughs when the healing knowledge of Atlantisreturned after the transformation into the next age. Surgery with a knife wouldbe outmoded. Only the use of hands, colour, crystals, and waters would benecessary. A new pioneer would vocalise wondrous findings which were just theinnate memories of his ancestors. Unfortunately, he may be laughed at, and itcould be another 50 years before the ideas began to be used. The use of colourfor healing is already emerging. Each colour is a frequency of the energy, andif you get the right colour and frequency for the right complaint, you canrestore harmony to the body and emotions.We look upon modern medical science with understandable wonder, from thelimitations of our current knowledge and awareness. But in fact cutting bits outof people, organtransplantation, toxic drug therapy and so on, is the medicaldark ages. The future lies in prevention and cure through the energy-fields.This is beginning very slowly to emerge under the heading of ‘VibrationalMedicine’1 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos290122]. Although somepractitioners do not realise it, we already have vibrational medicine at work inwhat is known as homoeopathy. Few people can understand why diluting a plantextract again and again can possibly have any power over disease, but in factthe vibration of the plant is still present in the water and it is thevibration, not the substance, of the homoeopathic preparation that has theeffect on illness.There were many warnings from the Avatar about nuclear technology, and medicineand science: “I try hard not to feel angry at the nonsense man has made. All issimple magic before your eyes. Don’t mess with genetics, just blend thesubstances given to you on Earth”. Chemistry was simple, as all laws were. Weshould work with them, not against them. We should work with the flow of theplanet, encourage and enjoy the elements and encourage and learn from theseasons. “Look for the simplicity and synchronicity around you. For everythingthere is a duality, and somewhere within it the answer lies. All is equal. Whenone (polarity) tries to rule the other only war and pain and ills proceed. Wheneach lives in harmony, all strife will cease, and the planet and the cosmos willunite. The choice is yours”.Attarro often talked about the Bible. Even though it had been changed andmisinterpreted, it still held many answers, and many secrets were revealed. TheBible had been written by alchemists, magicians, seers, healers and doctors, whothemselves had written of things they did not understand. They had left them fortheir children to follow. We should let the Bible fall open, using the old textand not the revised versions, as many secrets have been lost. The tombs of timewere opening, the cobwebs clearing and the sun arising. We should also hold ourreligious ceremonies outside in the elements, preferably within the gentlemagnetism of the stones. Worshipping indoors under a roof was too restrictingand diminished the effect.The knowledge, wisdom and advice of the Avatar covered many varied subjects asthe sensitive’s pen flowed to the rhythm of the thought-forms. This is a summaryof some of it:Only plants, shrubs and vegetation which have been grown in the soil of acountry for 50 years are suitable for the inhabitants of that country. Theplanet’s balance is for the gentle use of humans, and too much importation ofgoods, natural and manufactured, disrupts the natural balance of eachcontinent’s vibrations. We should use where found or made as much as possible.Waters and rivers preserve the natural energies of the universe. Rock crystalsand quartz are part of the chemistry to keep the unison flowing. Coal andcharcoal should be left in the earth where they filter the waters down into thecore, keeping the earth moist and cool and at the correct temperature for humansto live on. Colour and mystical music cure many ills, including heart diseaseand cancer, which are caused by stress and are bio-chemically related. Thetechniques would also transform childbirth and give the child a more serenebeginning. The moment of birth, as Atlantis had taught, should be a delight formother and child, not full of fear, trepidation and trauma. The use of lights,water and serene music has been lost in the tidal wave of humanity’s greed andmaterialism.I learned much from these messages, and many blurred areas were brought intofocus. I learned more about myself, too, in a message sent by Attarro, the day Iwent to see the Northamptonshire sensitive for the first time. It said I alwayshad three spirit beings around me to guide and protect me, and only good couldcome from my work. (I was told later that my three guides are from the planetUranus.) I was also told that I might become involved in literature about theIncas of Peru, and that I should let my vibration flow in that direction. Iwould be drinking of holy water soon and meeting with people of great importancethrough my work. Many mystics would gather and a new group would be born.Attarro said the sensitive would know me by my eyes, my voice, and the shape ofmy fingers (swollen through arthritis), and that she may see other things aroundme and be aware of my unusual energy-patterns. “He is a solidifier of thoughtand helps the Word to surface with those he meets”. She should tell me to goeast and put my mind and thoughts in that direction. I should “meet with thedragon soon” (subsequently confirmed as Japan). I would have to write severaldifficult letters (I already knew what some of these would be), but my handwould flow when the time was ripe.The channel was widening, said Attarro, and the information was ready to pour.My work-place might change shape or position unexpectedly and then much truthwould be found. As she took this part of the message, the sensitive had thevision of a ginger cat. I was about to leave for Canada and I was told mytimetable there might be slightly disrupted. I was warned to take care of my ownhealth and that of Linda. “She is rather over-tired of late, and a littleswallowed by the change of events. We send our love and blessings to her also,as she is the bowl and you are the roses”. There might be a time when I was “ledon”. I should watch for the time, it would be around the daffodils. “Watch yoursignature on the paper – and know the dealer and the dealings”.Later that afternoon the sensitive gave me a reading with Tarot cards. I had toselect a pile of cards from the pack at random, and she was given psychicmessages based upon the symbols of the cards I had chosen. She said I would meetsome sort of doctor. This would happen when I was not expecting to meet anyone.There would be a lot of information coming through this person, or he or shewould lead me to people with information. She asked me if I had been working onthe story of the Holy Grail, the famous legend about King Arthur’s, Merlin’s andthe Knights of the Round Table’s search for this object. I had. I already knewfrom other communications that the story was true and the characters hadexisted, and I knew that an aspect of Rakorczy had been Merlin. There have beenmany theories about what the Grail actually is. Some say a chalice cup made fromthe cross on which Christ was crucified, and others say it was a stone. Thesensitive said the truth of the legend would be made known to me soon.She went on to say that the next six months would show incredible changes in me;I would have a different energy-flow and my feminine vibration, the one thatgoverned intuition and psychic abilities, would be tuned up. I would be given atalisman in the next two months which would be a good vibration for me to holdor to wear. There would be travel to all ends of the earth, much of which wouldbe on water. I would spend several months in different places, and she saidthere was a strong Australian feel. (A trip to Australia has since beenconfirmed by another psychic.)All the expanding sources of information were confirming and cross-checking eachother on the basic story of reincarnation, karma, the energy-system, the greatchanges for people and the earth, and the job I am here to do. All were tellingthe same tale, and it would not be long before many of the predictions byRakorczy, the Avatar and the sensitive were all to be proved right by events."},{"pageContent":"7Diamonds in the MudDeborah Shaw had returned to Canada, and a connection with the North AmericanIndians was emerging strongly. They, too, carried the knowledge of theenergy-system through the generations, but much of it has been lost as theirculture has become Westernised.In the days before she left Kenilworth to return to Alberta, Deborah was gettingpsychic messages and visions about a past life as a member of the BlackfootTribe, which is still based a short drive from her home in Calgary. Every timeshe closed her eyes on her return flight she saw Indians standing, walking ordancing. She was told that her Indian life ended in the last century at the ageof 98. The Indians revered their elders and her age alone made her special tothem with all the knowledge she had of the old ways. Apparently, she had naturalhealing powers in that lifetime, but they were suppressed by some emotionalblockage.Two days after this information came through to her, she was busy on the phoneas one call followed another. But then she felt an enormous push and she wasleft in no doubt that she should leave the phone, sit down, and clear her mindfor a message. It said that I had to go to Alberta and an area south of Calgarynear the site of the Old Man River Dam – a dam which the Indians hadunsuccessfully opposed, because it meant flooding part of their sacred burialgrounds. Deborah said the clarity of the message was the most powerful she hadyet received.She wrote to me with the details of the communication, and within a week anotherletter had arrived. She had been given a further message. She had seen a visionof an Indian who was in a boat with the body of a woman. He shot an arrow intothe air and it was guided by the Great Spirit and landed in a special place. Itwas here that the woman was laid to rest. She was very special and so was he.Both Deborah and myself were in the vision also. The Indians in the scene wereobviously from another age, but the surroundings were modern, how they wouldlook today.I had no doubt that I should go. I was speaking at an Animal Rights Conferencein the United States a month later, and I arranged to spend the previous week inCalgary. When I met Deborah at the airport neither of us knew what was going tohappen or where we were to go, although her rapidly developing psychic abilitiesprovided a good link with the spirit guides and I was sure all would be well.Deborah grew up in the English Midlands in the Kenilworth/Leamington area. Bothher parents died when she was young. One day when she was in her teens the soulof her mother contacted her. She thought she was losing her mind, and it tookmany years and a visit to a medium for her to accept that she was psychic andthat what she was seeing was real. By the time we met at Calgary Airport, thecommunication channel was so open she was constantly seeing spirit-forms.She took me to the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, where one floor is devoted toIndian history. There were many mentions of shamans and medicine men, who werekeepers of the knowledge in each tribe, passing this knowledge on only to thosewho were trusted. Even then they had to go through a long apprenticeship. Wefound a picture at the exhibition of an un-named Indian chief holding copies oftreaties signed with the white settlers in the last century. We both dowsed thatmy soul had been that chief.We were also led to many books. At the museum shop we bought one about Indianhistory, and I was particularly struck by a picture of a medicine wheel. Thiswas the Indian version of a stone circle, an energy-power point. The Indianswould dance around them to charge up the energy, and the sounds they made woulddo the same. At another shop in the city we were led to other books, includingone called Star People about people alive on Earth today who came from otherplanets, and another called… Medicine Wheels. These were obviously going to playa major part in this visit to Canada.The next stop on this spiritually-guided tour was the junction of two rivers inCalgary, the Bow and the Elbow. This is close to the Calgary Fort Historic Park,where the white settlers first made their home in what was to become thepresent-day city. It was hard to believe, looking across at the skyscrapers ofdowntown Calgary, that this settlement was established in the lands of theIndians little more than 100 years ago. It has been said several times incommunications that rivers are vitally important to the energy-system and thelife of the earth, and the points where rivers meet are especially powerful.This power had been diminished at the junction of the Bow and Elbow by the angerand resentment of the Indians at seeing their way of life destroyed. This hadproduced much dark energy, as had the settlers with their treatment of theIndians.We had to sprinkle water symbolically from the rivers on to the land and saywhatever came into our minds or, rather, what was put into them. Deborah said:“Forgive them everything”, and I said once again: “Let there be light”. Thisspot is symbolic in itself of what we have done to the world in such a tinyspeck of time. We looked in one direction and saw the beauty of the Bow as ithurried out of the city. We looked the other way and there was modern Calgary,with its pillars of glass standing in worship and homage to the god they calloil.We were led by the pendulum to the top of the mound that once was Fort Calgary.I thought this might be an energy-centre which we were meant to clear. Instead,there was a ceremony to perform to remove one of my own karmic blocks. Deborahwas given the words I had to say: “I forgive myself for all the wrongs I havedone in all my past lives. I forgive all those who have hurt me or will try tohurt me in the future. To err is human, to forgive divine”.It was becoming obvious that I had some kind of link with the Indians in thisarea of Canada, and this was confirmed the following day when we went to NoseHill high above Calgary. The views are spectacular, but it has become a bit of adumping ground for debris and earth from building sites. We climbed one of thesemounds of earth, which had grassed over, and the message came that we shouldface the sun and chant the ancient words we had each been given. We then had togive thanks for the privilege of being in such a sacred place, and ask forcourage and strength for what we had to do in the future. Deborah said we weresurrounded by the spirit-forms of Indians. They said if we spoke to them theywould hear and respond. I said how much I respected their wisdom and knowledgeand how determined I was to see the truth win through. They said we were “a truebrother and sister of the family”.They told us that another mound nearby covered the site of a medicine wheel, avery powerful energy-site, and we had to walk a circle seven times to charge itup as best we could. The communications were coming mainly from an Indian spiritwho took the form of an elder, and he had, Deborah said, “a twinkle in his eye”.He described the wonderful life they had before the land was taken away. Theywere sad, but not bitter at how they and the land had been treated. But, he toldus, the great wind would blow away the mounds of earth and all would berestored. “The winds will move boulders as if they are pebbles”, he said.The next afternoon, we travelled some distance from Calgary near to anotherpoint where two rivers meet. We had to walk quite a way along the side of ariver and then climb on to a ridge looking out across the country. It was aplace of indescribable beauty, known by the ancient Indians as Long Shadows. Onthe ridge, the pendulums were spinning very strongly in the negative direction,indicating a serious energy-imbalance. We didn’t know quite what to do andDeborah asked for guidance. The message came immediately that we should go downon to a small plain below the ridge. As soon as we arrived I saw some bushes. Iknew that was the spot, and Deborah felt the same.It was the site of an old medicine wheel and Indian camp. The wheels were madeof small stones arranged like a wagon wheel, with lines of stones going from thecircle to a central point. The stones were aligned to the earth’s energies,astrological movements and principles. They go back thousands of years. Anotherhost of Indian spirits appeared to Deborah to tell the story of this place. Thesettlement had been joyous and happy until the son of the chief had destroyedsomething sacred to them in a moment of defiance. They decided to kill him, andthis had taken place on the ridge we had just left. After that the life-energyof the tribe had ebbed away and they broke up in pain, anger and bitterness. Thetime had come to remove the pain, re-unite the tribal family, and forgive thesoul of the son which had been through much suffering. It was also time torestore the life-force to this area.We walked the circle of the former medicine wheel seven times as instructed andwent back to the ridge. There, under spiritual direction, we had to hold handsto form a circuit of energy and ask the Great Spirit to cleanse the site andoffer forgiveness to the soul of the son. I said that the period of pain andsuffering was over and the soul was welcomed back into the arms of the family.All was forgiven and we should look ahead with joy and hope to the new worldthat was soon to come. “Let the pain and suffering be gone and the light flowagain”, I said, and Deborah was given the words: “And the deer will drink thewater, the children will laugh, and families will be reunited”.When it was over Deborah saw the spirit-form of an eagle with a red eye flyingover us. He said we would always have his protection, always be under his wing.As we left, the spirits of the Indians said they were getting their head-dresseson and they were going to have a big celebration party. All these activitieswere happening on the astral plane, but the karmic consequences of theirearth-lives had to be broken by a ceremony on the plane where the events tookplace, and the energy blockage had to be dispersed on this plane, also, whichwas why we had to be there.As we made our way back, my attention was taken by a stone on the ground, andthe pendulum said I should take it with me. It was, we subsequently discovered,one of the stones that once made up the medicine wheel. I have to take it to amajor energy-site in Asia. On the outward journey we had to climb a fence, andwe remembered it well because it was none too easy. When we returned there,however, there was a little black stone on the top of the fence, which haddefinitely not been there before. This was the talisman the sensitive hadpredicted, and I was told to keep it with me always. On the other side of thefence was a stone left for Deborah. Other predictions by the Avatar and thesensitive also came true: when I first arrived at Deborah’s house, I met hercat. It was ginger. And my Canadian time-table was slightly disrupted – I had tostay on an extra day.By now I knew more about my soul’s past life as an Indian. I had been Setting onan Eagle Tail, the chief of the Peigan Indians (pronounced Paygan), who werelinked together with some other tribes under the name Blackfoot. He was chieffrom 1875 until his death ten years later, and he signed the peace treaty withthe settlers along with other chiefs. Linda, Kerry and Gareth were all with mein that life.The name Blackfoot – which resulted from the colour of their moccasins – wasgiven to one individual tribe as well as being an overall term for several. Thenext afternoon we were directed to the Blackfoot reservation and their burialgrounds. Under a large cross we found the grave of Crowfoot, one of the mostfamous Canadian Chiefs, who also signed the peace treaties. There, Deborahpicked up a piece of seemingly dead wood with a round hole in the centre, andthe pendulum indicated that I should take it home.Our other call at the reservation was at the college, where there is a smallmuseum of original Blackfoot clothes and artifacts. It was late afternoon and wewere told at the college that we were too late.The museum was closed, they said, and locked up for the day. This was a blow,but we decided to see if the curator was still around. There was no reply when Iknocked on his office door, and we were about to leave when I saw another doorajar. It was dark inside, but as I found the light we saw that we were standingin the museum. Someone had forgotten to lock up. We were drawn to the medicinebags used by the medicine men – they were generating terrific power. Apparently,they were giving us a form of protection. For some reason I have yet toestablish, I also had to write down Eagle Tail’s Indian name, which was printedon a copy of the peace treaty in the museum. It was Zaotze Tapitapiw.That evening we visited the home of a lovely Canadian lady who was going tointroduce us to an Indian friend. But we soon realised that it was her, not theIndian friend, whom we were meant to see. She had many books on spiritual andmystical matters, and they, along with our conversation, gave us a number ofclues. Deborah was looking at a book of mystical pictures called Shaman, thePaintings of Susan Sedden-Boulet, and in it she found a picture of Merlinholding a piece of wood exactly like the one we found at Crowfoot’s grave. Thewords alongside the painting said:I will not forget these stones that are set,In a round on Salisbury Plain,Tho’ who brought ’em there, ’tis hard to declare,The Romans, or Merlin, or Danes.A few days after my return to England I had to take the piece of wood and buryit at a round on Salisbury Plain. It wasn’t Stonehenge, but I won’t say where itwas because it is balancing the vibrations, I understand, between that site andthe one in Canada, and must be left alone.Later during that evening, the lady began to talk about obsidian, a volcanicrock. Even she didn’t know why she suddenly brought this into the conversation,but it proved to be significant. She showed us a book which said obsidian wasnormally found in areas of present or past volcanic activity and was formed inthe same way as is a diamond. It was a protection stone, and helped to safeguardthe owner from being emotionally drained by others. It gave support for thosestressed by outside pressures and protected the soft-hearted and gentle peopleof the world from being misused. Its very colour, black, acted as a screen tokeep out the unwanted, said the book. The talisman I had been given is made fromobsidian.There were enough mentions of a certain crystal shop that night to leave us inno doubt that we were to go there. At the shop we were led to a book about astone called moldovite. We both had to buy a copy, and a piece of moldovite camefree with each one. The exact origin of the stone isn’t known except that itcame down to earth from somewhere else in the universe and landed in what is nowSlovakia about 14.8 million years ago. It is thought to help to acceleratespiritual awakening, and has been linked with the legend of the Holy Grail. Wetalked with the shop owner as we bought the books, and in the course of thatconversation he mentioned various places in Alberta, including Vulcan. Themoment he said the name it struck a strong and immediate chord with both of us.We knew there was something to be done in that area, and away we went to startwhat was to be the longest day of our lives.Vulcan is only a small settlement, and by Canadian standards only a short drivefrom Calgary. As we got closer a cloud ahead of us became a spectacular tapestryof colour. All the other clouds in the sky were white, but this one was red,blue, green, gold, every colour you could think of. While this was happening ourattention was caught by the sharp, black silhouette of a figure standing at thetop of a large mound to our right. The pendulum was most emphatic that this wasthe place we should stop. When we pulled over, Deborah had a vision ofpurply-green rocks pulsating inside the mound. We walked to the top and therewas no sign of anyone. The dark figure had been projected by the spirit-realmssimply to point out the spot.We were told that the bodies of many murdered Indians were buried in the moundand, as a result, it was beset with dark energy. We had to remove and keep twolarge stones buried in the summit, and perform a ceremony with water to allowthe energy of Light to flow again and disperse the darkness. We had bought abottle of water 20 minutes earlier with the intention of drinking it. We wereled from here to the place where two rivers meet on the plains nearer toCalgary, or, more to the point, where two rivers appeared to meet when we lookedat the map. Those rivers had now been sucked dry by the demands of themonoculture cornfields that have turned this once-beautiful area into afeatureless, soulless monument to human misunderstanding.We found our location in a large field alongside what was once a river. Again,it was beset with dark energy. A communication to Deborah told of the time whenan Indian tribe lived here. Many of them had died of smallpox after being givenblankets by white traders which had once covered smallpox victims. Sometimesthis was done by accident, but it was also used as a way of wiping out tribes sotheir land and few possessions could be taken. The medicine man of that tribehad suffered great anguish when he could not cure his people. This was a whiteman’s disease and he had no answer to it. The soul of the medicine man was stillsuffering, and there was another ceremony of forgiveness to perform to clear theenergy blockages. Deborah had to sprinkle soil on to a stone.A little further up the road, or track as it was, there was another site toclear, part of what had been the same Indian settlement. Deborah began to feelpains in her shoulders and left side. Here an elder of the tribe had put a curseon the land and we had to remove the curse for the sake of the land and the soulresponsible. The elder had been racked with pain at the end of his earth-life,and this related to what Deborah was feeling. I had to put my hand on theseareas of pain and ask the Great Spirit to free the soul and the land from theconsequences of the curse. Immediately her pain disappeared. Deborah saw avision of the elder riding off into the distance, free at last.It was late afternoon and we had been out for six hours. We asked if we werefinished for the day. No, came the reply. Finished? We had hardly begun. We wereguided west and towards the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Our first stop wasa place called Magnetic Hill. From there you can see a massive area of land downacross the plains and up over the foothills to the Rockies. We found a cattletrough carved out of a tree trunk, and this was where another Indian had laid acurse on all the land he could see in response to the activities of thesettlers. Another ceremony of forgiveness and release was performed for the souland the land.As we travelled deeper and deeper into the hills and forests, Deborah wasgetting more information about these curses. Three brothers and two of theirwives had decided to curse as much of the land the white man was taking as theypossibly could. One brother had been the elder on the horse at the smallpoxcamp, another had been the Indian at the water trough on Magnetic Hill, and oneof the wives had been the soul of Deborah. The other brother was the spirit shehad said had a twinkle in his eye at Nose Hill. That spirit had once been herhusband.We travelled for many miles through the forests, much of it on dirt roads, untilwe were told to stop. This was where Deborah’s soul and the other wife in thestory had stood back-to-back and cursed all the land they could see in bothdirections. It was what the Indians called bad medicine. Deborah’s mother hadbeen telling her for days to learn the words of the song ‘I Vow to Thee MyCountry’, and now she knew why. She had to sing it at this spot! She could justabout remember the main words between laughing. This was, of course, merelysymbolic of her soul saying sorry and asking forgiveness for what it had done.With that, the bad medicine was lifted and a blockage was removed which wouldallow her psychic powers to become even stronger. It was this same blockage thatsuppressed her natural healing powers during that Indian life. Her motherconfirmed that she would become even more psychic from now on. “You will startto see things happen now”, she said. Deborah’s mother had other personal reasonsto ensure that the freeing of this land went well. She had been the other Indianwife who had imposed the curse.Night fell, and the moon appeared magnificently over the trees. It was the nightbefore full moon, and the landscape glowed with its reflection. We were headingfor another place, for something I had to do. We had established that in thelife that I became Chief Eagle Tail, I had known the Indian woman who wasDeborah, and she had taken every opportunity to encourage me to hate the whiteman. We were asked to stop the car alongside a river which winds its way throughthe hills. I had been gifted with so many memorable sights on my travels, butthis was the finest yet. The moon was reflecting its power on the surface of theriver and backlighting the hills. There was not a sound, save the odd vehiclepassing. We walked along the river bank, stopping many times to admire themoon’s perfect image on the water.Eventually we came to a place where the path went right to the water’s edge andopened out to form a small ridge. The next stage of the story came through. Ihad signed the treaty with the settlers, but while we saw it as a peace treatybetween nations, they saw it as a real estate contract. Once we were on thereservations we became little more than prisoners, and we had to battle to keepeven the land the treaties had allocated to us. One night I had tricked thetribe medicine man into giving me the means to put bad medicine on this land,and I had come to this spot because this was where the soul of Deborah had mether husband, and she had told me about its beauty many times.I had to ask the Great Spirit for forgiveness, to forgive myself, and to ask forthe curse on the land to be lifted. I said I had learned that hatred andresentment were not the answers, whatever the provocation. Only forgiveness andunconditional love for all could solve the problems of the earth and its people.I walked away from that unforgettable place, my soul lightened by the burden ofkarma that I had now left behind.We were several hours from home already, but there was still much more to do. Wesaw a sign to the construction site for the Old Man River Dam, and as this hadbeen part of Deborah’s first message for me, we turned off. We went across abridge over the river and stopped at one of the entrances to the site. As we didso Deborah said: “This is it – this is the scene I saw in the vision”.The river was low, and we walked across the mud and thousands of large stones tothe water-side. When we stopped I saw a stone shaped like a diamond; thependulum said we should take it with us. Then I saw another diamond-shaped stoneand another and another. We collected eleven, and the words of Rakorczy cameback to me: “The diamonds can be found even in the mud – the waters wash themclean, the whirlpools of life (those Indian incarnations) will lead you to wherethe diamonds are”.Deborah was given the background to her vision of the Indians in the boat. Itwas something that had happened 1400 years ago. Her soul had been the woman inthe boat – she was the medicine woman of the tribe. The man who fired the arrowhad been the chief and her husband – he was the soul of the lady we had met thenight before in Calgary. My soul had been their son. Where the arrow had landedin Deborah’s vision was now the burial ground held sacred by the present-dayIndians, who were campaigning against the building of the dam, which would floodthe area. We had to perform another ceremony, again sprinkling the water on theland to remove symbolically the effects of past and present events.We were told the diamond stones would be used to make a form of medicine wheelon Nose Hill the following night. As we drove towards Calgary we were beingasked to stop at almost every by-road off the main highway to clearenergy-blockages. Deborah would get pains in her back, leg, arm or wherever, andshe would be told of incidents of horrific cruelty that happened at the variousplaces. All the victims were Indians. They had been shot, beaten, raped,disabled – the stories were appalling. We lost count of the number of times wehad to stop. At each place we had to ask the Great Spirit (a perfect descriptionof the Godhead) to forgive the souls who did the deed, and the soul of thevictim for the hatred and resentment that resulted from it. What a sad placethis area must have been. Deborah had a message that Michael or Mikaal, thearchangel responsible for the earth, was working with us that night. We werealso told that the forces of darkness were trying to disrupt our work.It was clear as we got nearer to Calgary that all these locations were on aley-line going into Nose Hill which, our spirit-guides told us, is one of theseven major chakras on the earth’s emotional body. It is the equivalent to thehuman body’s forehead or third eye chakra, the one through which we developspiritual awareness. Canada is an energy-centre of world importance, withchakras on all of the earth’s bodies. England has two earth chakras, one atGlastonbury Tor in Somerset and another at Avebury in Wiltshire, and some of theworld’s most famous landmarks are also chakras or major energy sites, includingUluru or Ayers Rock in Australia.It was nearly five o’clock in the morning when we reached Nose Hill and lookedout over the blaze of neon that was Calgary. Here we had to ask the Great Spiritto forgive all the souls who had ever lived in this area for all the wrongs theyhad done to each other, and to disperse the shields of darkness with the powerof Light. We both had to speak these words three times. When we arrived home, wehad been out for 20 hours.There was one other aspect to that night which gave us what seemed to be aglimpse of some of the star movements that will, we Were told, soon take place.At several of our stops, Deborah was sent a vision relating to the future. Shesaw the earth as an egg-timer with the sand running out, and then came news ofchanges in the night sky:The star constellations appeared as their astrological symbols. Taurus the Bullchanged its position in relation to Pegasus the Horse. They started out lookingaway from each other and turned to face one another. Three shields appearedcarrying the symbols of the horse, lion and bear, representing theconstellations of Pegasus, Leo and the Great Bear. The bear jumped over the topof the horse, indicating the constellations will change places accordingly.She saw the lady, which is the symbol of the constellation Cassiopeia, lookingbetween the two lines of Gemini. The bear then moved through between the twolines.A few days later she saw the lion turn upside down and a beam of light coming tothe earth from Regulus, a star in the Leo constellation.With these visions came the message that the new energy-system cannot reach theearth with the stars in their present positions and these, therefore, wouldchange. All would begin in 1992 with the process complete by 1998. It will be,she was told, the 31st or 32nd century before evidence of these changes can beseen from earth.The energies are stepped down in frequency at the various levels so that noplanet receives energy it cannot handle. If we, at our stage of evolution, weregiven some of the highest frequencies, we would be blown to dust. It would belike walking into the most powerful laser beam. Energies coming into this solarsystem are reduced in power by a being called the Solar Logos, whom I will betalking more of later. The energies are also filtered again by combinations ofstars and planets. One combination is made up of Polaris, the pole star, theconstellation of the Great Bear, and another star, Vega, which make up apositive-neutral-negative triangle. This is being replaced by anothercombination, it would appear, and this is one reason for the shuffling of thestars indicated to Deborah.We spent most of the rest of that day sleeping, until we were given the word tobuild the medicine wheel at Nose Hill just before midnight. Vehicles are notallowed on to the hill, and there is no natural way in by car anyway. But we hada pile of stones to take, so we had to find an entrance. The pendulum led us toa building site and a dirt track where the contractors’ vehicles had theiraccess. We reached a spot not far away from some houses on the edge of the hill,and we were told that this was the place and not, surprisingly, the old medicinewheel where we had been a few days earlier. It was a wet and misty night, andthat provided the cover for what we had to do.We had with us, according to instructions, all the diamond stones, many otherswhich we had collected at the places we had visited, firewood, and some water.We arranged the diamond stones in a circle and built a base for a fire with theothers. We walked the circle seven times to charge up the energy, and when thefire was lit and burning we had to ask the Great Spirit to help us to give powerand Light to this sacred place. The other dimensions can’t help unless we askbecause that would be denying us free-will. This is why Christ said: “Ask andyou shall receive”. We had to sprinkle water on the fire as we said our words,which we had to repeat three times. Deborah said that about half way throughthis, crowds of Indian spirits came across the brow of the hill and stoodwatching us. With them were the spirits of a buffalo, deer, beaver, bear, eagle,butterfly, and a variety of birds and animals native to Canada.As we left, the spirits began their work. No doubt this included ceremonies offorgiveness by all the souls who had contributed to the darkness that hadblighted this crucial energy-point. The next day, as I caught my flight to theAnimal Rights Conference in the United States, it was snowing and the weatherwas terrible. It stayed like that for the next four days, and no constructionwork was possible on the building site near the medicine wheel. It also tookprecisely that time for 1500 souls to take part in the ceremonies required todisperse the dark energies. When the cleansing was complete, this key point onthe Earth’s emotional body was working powerfully once again. This was crucial.The importance for all of us of stabilising the earth’s emotions is beyondcalculation."},{"pageContent":"8Journey to AquariusThere was a time when a UFO sighting was a big event. Today there is an endlessstream of reports and publications about people who have seen strange flyingmachines and ‘aliens’. This is not surprising. There are many beings from otherplanets working to help the earth and its life-forms through the years ahead.These beings are not aliens, but our brothers and sisters in the divine family.They have become known as extraterrestrials. In fact we are allextra-terrestrials when we are not in a physical body, but I am using thisestablished term to describe those coming to us from other planets and starsystems. A few are working with the forces of darkness, it is true, but theoverwhelming majority are here to help us. They always come in numbers atcritical times in our evolution, and the Bible contains descriptions of‘chariots’ that are clearly spaceships, and talks of people arriving on beams oflight.There are many souls who have lived on earth over thousands of years whooriginate from other planets. I am one of them, and so are Linda and mychildren. We came from a planet called Oerael (pronounced Oreal) in anothersolar system, and arrived at the start of Atlantis. Most of those working tobring in the new age of Aquarius also came from other planets a long time ago.To explain how and why this came about, and its significance for the future, wemust look, briefly, at the history of the Earth and its fall from spiritualgrace. The Godhead does not so much create as create the creators. I read atthis time that solar systems are formed by deva spirits often known as archons.They produce the atomic structure of suns, around which new systems can come torevolve. Archons have a special ability to produce and manipulate matter to formasteroids, the so-called ‘minor planets’. The archons create a swirling stormaround the asteroids, made up of cosmic energy, minute particles of matter andother gases and substances. Over millions of years in our time-scale, thecomponents of this cosmic dust-storm begin to cling to asteroids, and theasteroids cling to each other. As the mass spirals and spins, contracts andcondenses, atomic-type reactions take place and a sun is formed. During thisprocess, parts of the Sun break away and begin to rotate around it. These coolto become the planets and forms of the new solar system. That’s what some of thebooks I came across at this time said, anyway. I await more information on this.A sun is much more than a source of warmth. What we see from earth is only thatpart of our sun within our range of frequency. It has many non-physical aspectswhich go out across the whole of the solar system, and it sends to us certainspiritual vibrations. Our sun is a spiritual giant, and this is why the ancientsused to worship it. They knew the sun’s true significance. The avatar said ofthe sun:She is the goddess of love and she will hold the answers… The heart, we know, isthe centre of the emotional being and the pulse-point of our human membrane. Thesun is the heart of our solar system, and she bleeds and burns and is outragedat earthlings for the destruction they have caused. The Sun’s spiritual guide isthe Solar Logos, that aspect of Godhead responsible for this solar system. Suchmighty beings, and others, come into a new solar system after the archons havecompleted their work, and they supervise its development and the creation oflife.At this stage in the formation of the solar system other great beings from thedeva kingdom start their work. The devas throw an etheric field or body aroundthe new planet, and this field is programmed with the blueprint for the overallevolutionary design, the type of atmosphere and life-support systems required.Under the direction of a planetary deva or archangel chemical changes are madewhich help to develop the first primitive life forms, and over massive periodsof time these become vegetation and animals. Physical bodies are evolved byintroducing to them higher and higher souls. It is the influence of the soulthat changes the body until it reaches the perfection and standards ofperformance necessary for that period of the planet’s evolution. It is importantto remember that the evolution of the soul and the body are separate. Theevolution of the body is only a process of developing a vehicle for the soul onany particular planet.This solar system is much older than scientists have believed. They haveestimated that the Earth was formed around 4,600 million years ago. According tocommunications from Rakorczy and others through Joan, the figure is more like49,000 million! The Earth, we were told, suffered a catastrophe when energy fromthe sun pressed down on the atmosphere, contracting and condensing it, anddestroying all organic matter. Evidence that science has gathered to make theirestimate of 4,600 million years relates to the time when Earth began to recoverfrom that disaster, not when the Earth was first created.There was also a cataclysm which brought an end to the dinosaurs. This happenedwhen another planet went across Earth’s orbit, and their etheric bodies touched.Earth just survived, but it was fatal for the other planet’s physical body,causing it to ‘die’. Human life has also been here vastly longer than sciencehas thought. Enormous evolution had already taken place before the first majorcivilisation emerged, called Mu, or Lemuria, as some people know it. China,Tibet and areas of the Middle East and South America were part of this landmass, in a world that looked very different from today. The colossal andunexplained stone statues on Easter island, 2300 miles off the South Americancoast, were from Mu, which included the present Easter Island as part of itsterritory. The Mu-an civilisation survived, indeed flourished, for manythousands of years, and the more advanced of their number built the firstcities. The remains of these can be seen several thousand feet up in parts ofSouth America. They were lifted to that height by another cataclysm whichbrought Mu to a devastating conclusion. There have been many such geologicalchanges through the life of Planet Earth, some a natural part of her evolution,some human-created. I feel that in Mu the latter was the case.I believe that around the time we call Mu the effect of a misguidedconsciousness which became known as Lucifer began to be felt on the physicalEarth. I think this aspect of consciousness made a challenge to the natural lawsof Creation. By that I mean it opposed the principles of harmony, balance, andflow in the energies and harnessed the negative polarity for its own power. Thiscaused fantastic disruption all over the Universe. The power of thisconsciousness gathered as it fed off the extreme negative energies it wascreating and learned how to use them more and more destructively. Other aspectsof consciousness were imbalanced and drawn into the web. The decision was madeby those who wished to restore harmony, that this challenge had to be met. It isthe deep memory of the Light-Dark struggle on other frequencies and in otherareas of this frequency that has seeped into the conscious level of many sciencefiction writers to manifest itself as stories and films like ‘Star Wars’ and‘The Empire Strikes Back’.The Luciferian Consciousness either caused havoc directly or worked through theminds and emotions of others. Planets were destroyed and there was devastationthroughout this Solar System. The key planet Lucifer wished to control was theEarth because it is the heart chakra of at least this part of the Universe andthe point from which the energy we call love emanates. I had a vision of theEarth as one of those glass balls you see hanging from the ceiling in dancehalls and discos. Light was being beamed at the Earth and it was cascading anddeflecting out from here to the Universe. This planet is also a point ofbalance. If you can unbalance, even destroy, the Earth then the effect on theUniverse would be catastrophic, creating yet more negative energy and increasingthe power of those feeding off it. This planet is, therefore, the scene of theultimate spiritual showdown.The Earth has been taken over by the Luciferian Consciousness. Aspects of itincarnated and others, in ever larger numbers, were controlled at the mind andemotional levels, by this consciousness while they were in incarnation. If youcan scramble people mentally and emotionally you can make them lose contact withtheir higher selves and become servants of your will. This is the problem thathumanity has faced from this period right up to the present day.A call went out across the Universe and beyond for volunteers to come here andremove the Luciferian domination. The first incarnations of these volunteersfrom other planets came during the period of Mu and the biggest influx came atthe start of the civilisation that followed Mu. This was Atlantis. These highlyevolved beings created the most advanced and amazing civilisation the planet hasyet seen. They used the power of crystals to create breathtaking cities of lightand love. For a time Atlantis was paradise on Earth.A communication from the Attarro Consciousness talked of how the Atlanteansworked with the dolphins. They were the animals beloved of the Atlantean era andcommunication was two-way. “They were the messengers and told of the currentsand the weathers and of anyone who tried to enter this place of love andharmony. Dolphins were the epitome of true love and controlled the waters andthe emotions. They taught the children to swim and to trust the waters.”In the beginning, the extra-terrestrials – the ‘volunteers’ – became theso-called High Priests of Atlantis. These were not High Priests in the religioussense, they were the keepers of the knowledge about the energies. They initiatedothers into these secrets, including Earth people, after a long and exhaustiveseries of teachings, tests and ceremonies. They were extremely careful about whohad the knowledge; like everything, it could be used for good or ill. Knowledgeis neutral. It is how you use it that is positive or negative and in the wronghands the knowledge available in Atlantis was potentially catastrophic.The Atlanteans understood how to use the natural laws to perform what we wouldcall ‘miracles.’ They could manifest and demanifest things and move greatobjects by levitation. “Beam me up, Scotty” is not so far fetched as you maythink, they could do that in Atlantis without any help from Scotty or anyoneelse. Their bodies were less dense and heavy than ours and they could do manythings that we would find hard if not impossible to believe.One communication from the Attarro Consciousness said that the Earth “…wept forthe loss of her children (in the spiritual sense), for she remembered whenEarthlings floated through tranquil skies and walked across her placid oceans.They communicated on all levels with the animals, plants, and rocks until thegiant freeze vibration set in”.The ‘freeze vibration’ – dense matter – came when the harmony created by theearly Atlanteans was destabilised by the Luciferian influence. Even most ofthose who had come to help the Earth were affected and they began to becontrolled by the forces of disharmony and destruction. Mayhem was unfolding inthe heavens as other planets were destabilised also. Some say this was the timethe Moon fell into its present orbit around the Earth, causing colossal effectsto this planet’s energy fields. Once again Earth-shattering geological eventsunfolded and the map of the world was changed beyond recognition. There was anaxis tilt and a tidal wave surged around the Earth. This was the ‘Great Flood’mentioned in the Bible. The land mass called Atlantis disappeared and with itwent the giant crystal at the heart of its power system. This crystal is stillunder the Atlantic Ocean and it is the effect of this which has created fromtime to time a gateway from this frequency to another. It is this that has ledto the strange happenings in what is called the Bermuda Triangle.The Earth was almost destroyed by the upheavals at the end of Atlantis, but justsurvived. Atlantis itself disappeared under the sea and it was this that allowedthe Gulf Stream to flow northwards to warm the British Isles. Some of thebackground to this period was given to me in a channelling through a sensitivein the West of England. To ‘channel’ is to tune your consciousness to anotherfrequency and allow information in the form of thought energy to be passedthrough your consciousness down to this level. Here your brain decodes thethought energy and turns it into spoken words. The communicator on this occasiongave the name Magnu:I feel you are sensing now the energies coming in, the energies surrounding yourplanet. This is causing many of you to ask questions. It is causing many of youto re-evaluate completely your way of life, where you feel you wish to go, whatyou want to do. It is causing tremendous upheavals. Some of these upheavals arevery confusing, very distressing, very disturbing. Some people in relationshipsare finding they can no longer continue in those relationships because theirpartners cannot tune into what they are tuning into. It is causing a great dealof disturbance. And I have said to this sensitive on more than one occasion thatyou must organise yourselves into groups to support each other.Now then. My own allegiance with your planet goes back to an Atlantean period.At this time there were many energies being used and information and knowledgebeing used which were for particular reasons of safety withdrawn, shall we say,to prevent complete catastrophe, to prevent total destruction of your planet.One could say these were emergency measures if you like, to prevent theinhabitants of this planet from an untimely destruction.Now at that time, shall we say, this knowledge was distributed only to the few,it was taught in what one would call a temple setting, though I am very carefulabout using this word. It has connotations, maybe. So let me use that word inthe broadest possible sense. There were those initiated into this knowledge.There were grades of initiation and those who passed the full initiation, thesewere known as Guardians of the Light and Keepers of the Secret Knowledge. Thisis the context from which I am coming.There came a time when this knowledge and the energies were withdrawn. It isvery difficult for me to explain to you precisely what I mean by that, so I willlet you mull these things over. As the energies around your planet quicken, sothese latent energies, these energies which have been withdrawn, will now bephased back in. They will gradually be awakened. As the consciousness level ofthe planet raises itself, those of you Light Workers who are working together toraise your consciousness, you will be able to hold more and more refinedvibrations and so we will be able to use you as a catalyst to be able to feed inmore and more energies.As more of you raise yourselves to meet the challenge, so we can awaken more ofthese energies. Now, energy is consciousness and the energies themselves containthe knowledge and the information which is beginning to surface again in yourconsciousness, so that many of you will remember the Atlantean times. You willremember that you communicated with say, dolphins and whales. You understoodthese other sentient creatures. You could levitate. You could cause quitesignificantly large objects to levitate. You could manifest things. You couldcause spontaneous combustion by not miraculous means at all. Once you know whatyou are doing these things follow. It is a matter of order.Now I am looking to a time on your planet when these energies, this knowledge,is re-awakened and re-integrated into your consciousness. I am not looking to atime when this knowledge will be for a few, but when your whole planet will beawakened to this understanding which you have simply forgotten. It is not amatter of new information, it is a matter of remembering who you are and whereyou come from.So you are being asked to change. You are being asked to change in a total way.It is not a matter of small changes, of a little thing here, a little thingthere. You are really being asked to turn yourselves inside out. There is amassive shadow which must be cleared and it’s up to Light Workers such asyourselves to focus yourselves on that challenge.(I should say at this point that channellers decode the thought energy intolanguage that reflects their own way of putting things. You will see what I meanhere:)Those of you in the forefront of this, you are rather like a snowplough. You arethe thin end of the wedge. You really have, how shall I put this? To a certainextent. I suppose, you have the shitty end of the job. You have got to do anawful lot, but nevertheless you are capable of doing an awful lot. That is whyyou have chosen to come, that is what you are here for, to really shovel someshit, and therefore make some space behind you to make it easier for the others.The Magnu consciousness then asked for questions. I asked about the Earth’senergy system. He confirmed what I said earlier about every life form having thesystem of chakras or power centres. We should imagine they were in sequences ofseven, he said, although it was, in fact, not quite so simple as that. Thesepower centres were like a fuse box. The fuse box in humans and the planet werenot exactly the same, but they were similar.As in your human body, there are energy lines around your planet, through yourplanet, which correspond, I suppose, very much to the acupuncture lines andmeridians in your body. Where two lines cross, you create a vortex (a whirlpoolof energy), a tiny vortex if it’s two. The more lines that intersect, the biggerthe vortex. Therefore when you have a chakra you have a large vortex ofintersecting energy. It is the same with your planet. Where the most linescross, there is the biggest vortex. Now you could say the plexus (network) inand around the islands you call the British Isles is the hub of the wheel ofplexuses and energies which surround your planet. It has acted in other timeslike a fail-safe device. In order to activate these chakric points upon yourplanet, the energies must all pass through the central point. They must passthrough the heart of the pattern.Magnu said the network had been created by previous Light Workers over manythousands of years into ancient history. They had wanted to protect the energiesand the planet, and they did this by creating a protective webbing, a protectiveshield around the World. This allowed the energies to be activated only by thosewho had access to the keys and knew what they were doing. When Magnu wasincarnated on Earth in Atlantis, the Keepers of the Light had their individual‘keys’. Those who operated at the heart of the system had the greatestresponsibility because they had the keys to all the systems as a fail-safemechanism should anything go wrong. Once the centre of the pattern was shutdown, all the other interconnecting systems around the planet were greatlylimited also. “In effect” said Magnu “You switch it off.” The keys, he said,were a “consciousness pattern, a series of harmonic equations, if you like,known only to the keepers of that pattern.”The British Isles was an important place to be, but he said we should not gettoo carried away by that. The energy system was interconnected, and every placedepended on every other place to complete the circuit. At the end of Atlantisthe keys were turned off in the British Isles to reduce the power of theenergies so they could not be used to destroy the planet. They are now beingturned back on and this is causing great changes on Earth as the old ordercrumbles in all its forms and the new begins to emerge.Magnu talked of what happened when people worked with energy lines. The effectwas two-fold. “When you start doing things to those lines, they start doingthings to you.” Yes, we were clearing blockages, but the work was also helpingus to tune into the energy and the knowledge it carries. We were beginning tobring forth our memory, and it was important that the knowledge we carriedwithin us from previous times was brought to the surface. This was the way itwas to be done – not by him or other communicators, telling us everything. Acrucial aspect of our experiences had been to activate our memories of theknowledge.The effect of turning down the energies and the knowledge they carried was thatwe forgot what happened and what we learned in Atlantis and before. The higherthe frequency of the energies around us, the higher levels of knowledge andintelligence we can tune into. In Atlantis those frequencies were much higherthan they are today. When the energies were turned down our access to theAtlantean Consciousness was lost and so we ‘forgot’ it ever happened. In thisway, the greatest civilisation this planet has seen is now looked upon as somesort of myth or fairy tale, a figment of the imagination. Gradually, those morepowerful energies of the higher vibrations are being restored and this is willhave – is having – a dramatic effect on all of us.It is the role in this life for those re-incarnated Atlanteans to restore thoseenergies. These are the beings from other planets and civilisations who came into wrest control of the planet from the Luciferian Consciousness. As Magnu said:There are many of you for whom the Earth is not your indigenous evolutionaryhome, shall we say. There are many of you on this planet who come from otherspheres of evolution. I think these have been called “star children” by some ofyour writers, that is a good enough expression. More evolved beings came to yourplanet and manifested on your planet in Atlantean times. This was the biggestimpulse on bringing the new knowledge into Atlantis which caused it to grow intothe civilisation that it was. New knowledge was brought into this system fromuniversal sources from highly evolved spirits, bringing knowledge into theplanet. And you’re going to bring it back, basically.With that, Magnu said goodbye and asked us to discuss together what we hadheard. I should say that on these occasions the words we hear are less importantthan the thought forms we are absorbing on our other levels of being. It is alittle like recording them on a video to be played later. The thought formseventually filter through to the conscious level and appear as greaterunderstanding and knowledge.The sensitve could remember being with Magnu in Atlantis and the end of thatcivilisation around 10,500 BC. She could also remember what he and others lookedliked in Atlantis, very different from our bodies today. They were much taller,around seven feet some of them, with a gold complexion and slanting, pale blueeyes. They had a more elongated skull and much higher hairline. They livedincredibly long physical lives, as did those in Mu. As this transformationcontinues, physical bodies on this planet will again look every different andwill live for hundreds of years.The sensitive is also one of the extra-terrestrials who helped to buildAtlantis. She believes she went astray after that glorious beginning. Todaythose volunteers from other planets who survived the onslaught of the LuciferianConsciousness through the period since then are few compared with the populationof the planet. They are the ones who have come through so many tests to showthat they are capable of being trusted to do the work in this incarnation whenthe Luciferian control is being removed.It is these souls who have carried the knowledge through the centuries sinceAtlantis in civilisations and communities like the early Egyptians, the Essenes,the early Incas, the Cathars, the native American Indians, and others. The mostfamous of these volunteers from other realms was the man we call Jesus. In thisGateway edition of the Truth Vibrations I have made a few changes to theoriginal text for two reasons: (a) I feel the themes of it are correct althoughmy understanding (memory) of the detail is evolving all the time and (b) thisbook was written at the start of my conscious awakening and it will beinteresting for people to read my later books to see how the process ofawakening and understanding unfolds and develops. However, I feel it is worthinserting here what I feel is the basic truth about Jesus as it has evolved inmy consciousness between the first edition written in 1990 and this onepublished in the closing weeks of 1993.The following information I channelled directly through myself and I was amazedto see how it is supported by others who have either channelled the same or cometo this conclusion from historical research:Jeshua (Jesus is a translation from the Jewish) was born in the normal way andnot by some virgin miracle. It was his task to stand up and speak out for thetruth and challenge the Luciferian-controlled status quo. He was linked closelywith the Essene Community which lived alongside the Dead Sea at Qumran where theDead Sea Scrolls were found after the Second World War. In his early life hetravelled widely to places like India, learning from those he met or, more tothe point, remembering what he already knew, but had forgotten in the process ofincarnation into a dense physical body. He was also a channel for bringingimmensely powerful healing and transforming energies to the Earth, energies thathave become known as the Christ. This is the energy of pure love. The vibratoryrate of his energy field was so high that he could channel energies of a powerthat would have fried most people on Earth at that time. So his task was to passon information that would help to open the minds of people to who they reallyare, and to channel energies into this physical frequency that would help tore-balance the planet and in this way also trigger and awaken people as theybecame less affected by Luciferian domination.This was not an attempt to remove the Lucifer Consciousness completely. It wouldnot have been possible then and the time for that was planned well in advance tobe the period we are living through today. This is why so many prophecies byNostradamus, Edgar Cayce, the Hopi Indians and many others, point to now for thetime of great change. What Jesus and those working with him were here to do waschannel enough energy, remove enough negativity, and change the collectiveconsciousness enough for the planet to be able to survive until now. This theyclearly achieved.Far from being the celibate he is claimed to be by the Church. I believe Jesusfathered at least three children by at least two women. The one known as MaryMagdalene was his main life partner, possibly his wife. His task was enormouslydifficult, especially since those who incarnated with him also affected theimbalances of the planet and the limitations of perception within the densephysical form. In the end so many people turned against him that he was nailedto a cross to silence him. But I do not believe that he died there. I feel thatthe man called Joseph of Arimathea was his natural father and that he had enoughinfluence and money to ensure that Jesus was taken from the cross alive, thoughin a desperate condition. My own feeling, and what I have channelled and ‘seen’,leads me to believe strongly that he survived. I had a very strong vision ofJesus on the cross. During that vision I was with Jesus, experiencing what hefelt. He experienced great pain in his hands and wrists, and he was utterlyexhausted. I then saw a pole being raised with a cloth which was offered to hismouth. From this he took a drink. Soon after this he appeared to loseconsciousness. When he awoke he was lying with people all around him, attendingto his wounds. They were all in white, I remember. It was clear that Jesus wasin a state of shock. He whispered “I live, I live”, as though he had expected tohave left the physical body. I had other visions and channelling, which togethergave me this overall picture of what actually happened two thousand years ago.Joseph of Arimathea had persuaded the authorities to have the crucifixion on hisland – the Garden of Gethsemane. Joseph was a rich man and not withoutinfluence. The Authorities did not realise that he was Jesus’s real father. WhenJesus was offered a wet rag on the end of a pole to give him a drink, itcontained a drug that brought about the appearance of death.2[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos290401] Joseph of Arimathea organised this,no doubt with a bribe here and there, and the ‘dead’ body was taken away to theEssene Community where Jesus recovered after a long convalescence. Very fewpeople knew what was happening and even Mary, his mother, and Mary Magdalenewere not in on the plot. They believed he had died until they were laterre-united with him.Jesus, I believe, lived a long life and visited many countries, includingBritain, passing on information and channelling energies, but none of this wasrecorded by history. In the eyes of the historians and the people of Jerusalemand the Roman Empire, he died on the cross. I feel that had he and others notchannelled vast amounts of healing energy at that time, the Earth could wellhave been out of existence by now. All through this period since Atlantis thoseother groups I have mentioned have come to work on the energy system and humanconsciousness to keep the Earth alive until today and the time of the GreatCleansing. I have no doubt that the consciousness that we call Jesus is back inincarnation now to play a part in this. All that knowledge and experience wouldnot be wasted at this of all times. And the last people to recognise him will bethe churches who claim to worship him. Indeed they will laugh at him or condemnhim as a blasphemer and imposter!This time his words will not be perverted as they have largely been in theChurch under the influence of the Luciferian Consciousness. The Church in itsmany forms has caused wars to be fought over dogmas that it created and hasfostered fear and terror of some mythical, vengeful God. So much blood has beenshed in the name of a being who was the very expression of love and peace forall.The Lucifer influence is responsible for much of this, but it would be misguidedfor humanity to blame everything on that source of imbalance. It can onlysucceed in manipulating our minds and values if we allow it to and for so longhumanity has given in. It is time to make a stand. This is one reason why theextra-terrestrials are encircling the Earth in larger and larger numbers, tohelp us to defeat these forces and make a gigantic leap in evolution into theAquarian Age when humankind, or those who are evolved enough to meet thechallenge, will rise out of the abyss of misunderstanding at last. They are hereto guide us through tremendously difficult times with love, wisdom, andunderstanding. For let us not deceive ourselves about the momentous task it willbe to lead humanity through some turbulent years and back into the Light wherewe belong.The highest levels of Divine Consciousness are now standing together as One toguide this planet into the new age of balance and enlightenment. We are nowbeing offered the opportunity to be part of a new world and new Earth based onlove and harmony. What greater gift, what greater challenge, could we be given?What greater vision could be put before us?"},{"pageContent":"9New VibrationsAfter seven months of intensive spiritual education and guidance from some veryhighly-evolved beings, I now understand something of the changes the earth andourselves are going through, but there is still an enormous amount that I stilldo not know. It is also clearer to me why these books are being written and whatthey are intended to achieve. With every book my consciousness, my ability tounderstand what is happening and why, will be opened wider, as will my eternalmemory. This is, apparently, deliberate. They could have contacted me years agoand taken me much further along the remembering process before I was launchedinto print. They didn’t because that is not the way they have chosen to bringthe message before the world. Each successive book will be more detailed and godeeper into the creation and evolution of life and the transition we are goingthrough.I have no doubts whatsoever that some of what I have said in terms of detail Iwill modify in future books. That is unavoidable in the circumstances in which Iam working. The idea is for the readers to grow with me as my knowledge andunderstanding is increased at each stage of the programme agreed and set outbefore I incarnated.I have offered to you what I was asked to produce, a basic explanation of theuniverse and the imminent transformation of life on earth. I am in theprivileged position of being guided out of the mist, and these books aredesigned to take others with me. There is a phenomenal way to go and there ismuch we will never know within the confines of a physical body. Even Jesus hadproblems coping with its limitations as he went in search of the Truths. Thereis always the frustration of seeing one new fact demand six new questions, butmany truths are within our grasp. I have outlined some of them here, such asreincarnation, karma, and the energy-system.I should however add some notes of caution at this stage. Communication betweenother planes and dimensions and ourselves is not like picking up the telephoneThe thought-forms have to be processed by the physical brain, and in so doingsome of the sharpness of the message can be lost – not the general meaning, butthe fine detail can get distorted. It doesn’t mean the detail is necessarilyless than accurate, but it can be. Different spirit communicators may also havetheir own interpretation and emphasis. There are many communications I have notincluded because they have yet to be confirmed by other independent sources.Where I have used messages of this kind, I have said so. It should also beremembered what I said earlier about the difficulties the other realms havesometimes in judging our time, and the time-scales are often changing anyway inresponse to human behaviour. You should bear that in mind when I give dates.They are the latest dates I have at the time of writing in November 1990. Theonly thing we can be certain about is that we are talking about this decade andwe should concern ourselves more with the consistent themes than with the finedetail.Having stressed those points I can say with great confidence that, at the veryleast, the vast majority of what you have read and are about to read isabsolutely correct. With that, let us conclude this first stage of the story.The evolution of the earth is arranged into ages, identified by the astrologicalsymbols. Jesus came to herald the age of Pisces, and we are now entering the ageof Aquarius. This is when we are to learn the oneness of everything. We will seethat all life-forms, animals, plants, minerals, devas, humans and planets, arecreated by the same source with the same energy. We are all on a magical journeyof evolution back to the Godhead. We are all part of one another. We are all thesame one consciousness at different stages of evolution.We knew this once long ago, but our spiritual standards declined, and the powerthat built the glory of Atlantis was switched off to stop the planet being blownapart. A group of Atlanteans who had retained their purity and values came toBritain, the hub of the energy-system, to shut down the powerful energies. Theybased themselves in Cornwall, and one Atlantean used his special energy-patternand knowledge to switch off these powerful energies. At the same time in SouthAmerica, a people who were eventually to become the Incas were channelling alower energy into the earth to replace it. Other people were also involved indifferent parts of the world.But who was this mighty Atlantean who came to Britain? It might help if I saidthe symbol for the energies he was working with is the sword. The Atlantean wasthe man the legends call King Arthur, and with him was Merlin. The story of thesword Excalibur was symbolic of those energies being switched off. The HolyGrail is not an object, but levels of consciousness and spiritual awareness.That is what the Knights of the Round Table were searching for in what hasbecome known as the pursuit of the Holy Grail. Anything that helps to developthis understanding, this state of being, could fairly be linked to the HolyGrail.When humanity showed that we were not yet evolved enough to be trusted with thehigher energies, we had to begin a series of lessons before we qualified foranother chance. These lessons have taken the form of learning the right way, orat least seeking it, by experiencing the wrong one. The Lords of the Rays suchas Rakorczy look after twelve rays of energy, seven of which affect us directlywhile we are in a physical body. A mixture of these seven is given to each of uswhen we incarnate to set us challenges and tests and give us the opportunity tolearn the lessons we have chosen for ourselves. Another separate combination isgiven to the Earth-spirit.These rays are: ray one – pure will and power; ray two – love and wisdom; raythree – intelligence (rational intellect, not wisdom); ray four – harmonythrough conflict; ray five – concrete mind and science; ray six – love anddevotion; ray seven – law and order and ceremonial magic, the Rakorczy ray.Our personal mixture sets us individual lessons, while the Earth mixture setsthe curriculum for the Earth-spirit and humanity as a whole. In the age justpassing, the main energies have been numbers three (intelligence), four (harmonythrough conflict) and five (concrete mind and science). How long we took tolearn the lessons they set was our choice. We could have made it easy forourselves, or very difficult. For instance, you can learn through wisdom that itis better to seek harmony rather than conflict, or you can learn it byexperiencing two World Wars. This doesn’t mean we were made to fight wars –nothing is more abhorrent to the spiritual Masters. It was our choice.It has been the same with human science. We could have seen a long time ago thatyou cannot explain the great mysteries of life through merely mechanical means,but we didn’t. Now with science hitting countless dead-ends in its attempt toexplain those mysteries, more and more people are looking for spiritual answers.Another example is the material society. Again, we could have seen before nowthat judging our own success and that of our countries by how much we consumewas bound to destroy the Earth and all life upon it. Instead we have had tolearn the hard way by experiencing what materialism is doing to great tracts ofthe planet.When you look from the wider perspective of evolution, however, that is notnecessarily a bad thing as long as we don’t go too far. The hardest lessons arethe best learned. You can see this in the numbers of people who have becomedisillusioned with the present way of life and are looking for new meaning. Thismakes them fertile ground for the spiritual truths that are now being offered tothem. The present energy combination is being joined by ray seven, law and orderand ceremonial magic. This will help us to raise our spiritual understanding andbring order from chaos. This is what the voice communication meant when it said:“The three will be replaced by four. The three points of the triangle willbecome the four points of the diamond. Another kind of energy is being addedthat will transform life on earth”. We are already seeing that transformation inaction and, as they say, ‘we ain’t see nothin’ yet’.As people have tuned to the new vibrations, we have had the rise of the Greenmovement, anti-cruelty movements, and vegetarianism. We have begun to care forthe Earth and see other forms of life as fellow expressions of Creation and notas commodities to be made as fat as possible as quickly as possible and sold foras much as possible. The meat industry is seeing these new values on the balancesheet, and as the vibrations speed up, businesses based on cruelty or theexploitation of animals, people or the Earth, will be in serious trouble.The division in our societies between those who are tuning in and those who arenot is becoming more evident with every year. It is the division between thoselooking for a new direction, a new path, and those still stuck in the delusionsof materialism. These divisions are breaking up relationships of all kinds, aspartners and colleagues begin to view life with a difference of perspective thatis soon to become a chasm. Humanity is being divided into those racing forwardspiritually and those still holding on to yesterday. It is the former group thatwill bring about the ‘cultural revolution’ that Wang predicted for Britain by1995. It will be the same in every country at some time in the next ten years,and you can see that the potential for conflict and confrontation between thetwo groups is enormous during this changeover period. The responsibility lieswith those tuning in to avoid this through peace, love and understanding at alltimes.Imagine what all this will do to the world economy, the system of destruction,as hundreds of millions reject the belief that consumption is the meaning oflife and the measurement of our success and well-being. The idea that economicsshould be based on setting people against people and country against country inbrutal competition will be just as soundly rejected, as will the exploitation ofthe weak by the powerful. Anyone tuned to the new vibrations could not live withsuch injustice.This, along with the economic implications of geological upheavals, extremeweather events, and military conflict, will see the world financial systemcollapse. This was inevitable at some stage anyway because it is built onself-delusion, but it will be hastened. We will have to create barter economies,goods and services being exchanged for other goods and services on a local orregional level. The orgy of materialism in the latter period of the Pisces ageis taking its final bow. The planet cannot take the punishment and so the systemis being removed.A message from Attarro in October 1990 predicted serious economic difficulties.“Estimated economic flows will change drastically and the economic system willneed much attention as the currency falls flat on its face. Disaster afterdisaster, you say. It is not necessarily disaster, it is an opening for newopportunity in learning on many levels. The peoples sometimes have to be shakenup to open their eyes and their new awareness”.The spirit realms are doing all they can to avoid conflict and wars breaking outamid the chaos and confusion, not least because the thought-energy that would begenerated by wars would be extremely harmful to the Earth and the energy-system,especially at this critical time. But they can do only so much to influence us.Human free will can always override them if we choose to allow darkness toreign. It needs us all to meditate and visualise peace. The economic, human,weather and environmental pressures will bring with them tremendous politicalchanges, too, and from what I gather very few of the big political names in theworld today will stay in office, or opposition, as the vibrations accelerate inthe 90s. A message through the Kenilworth source on September 8th 1990 said thatMargaret Thatcher would not be Prime Minister of Britain for very much longer:You have a woman who speaks with too loud a voice and cannot feel the tempo ofthe seasons. She will go before the changes come and the ones who will rule areprepared for the work they must undertake. Fear not. It is not our way to bringpain to humankind, but decisions have to be made in which we play our part.On November 3rd, ten days before the Deputy Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe,resigned, came this: “There are already changes within your government andothers will follow swiftly. It will be necessary for a different style ofgovernment to be established”. Two weeks later Mrs Thatcher was forced toresign. She will not be the only political casualty as the new spiritual climateincreasingly turns us away from the responses of anger and aggression andreplaces them with love and peace. The automatic writing said that thepoliticians had not been taught the ways of the ancients or they feared a powergreater than their own. They fought with weapons and anger to preserve what wastheirs when the universe really belonged to everyone and could not be divided inthis way. Everything was for the good of all and should be shared equally acrossmany lands.The world political scene will change on a scale and often with the speed ofwhat we saw in Eastern Europe, which was, itself, a manifestation of the newvibrations at work. I was told by one message from Rakorczy of changes in theSoviet Union, with Mr Gorbachev replaced as president before 1992. This wouldlead to the states of the USSR being self-governed. They would operate asindependent countries within an overall organisation that would co-ordinateco-operation between them. This would set the example which the rest of theworld would eventually follow.The present way of life in the United States was also coming to an end beforethe end of the decade, according to a Kenilworth communication: “On the otherside of your large ocean, there will be many changes in government. This part ofyour world has for too long sought happiness through greed and has given littlethought to the needs of other people. In particular, they have not concernedthemselves sufficiently with the knowledge their brown brothers carry”.Every other nation would go through political and economic transformation,although in Britain the Establishment were likely to cling to the old illusionslonger than most, said the spirit guides. A new political grouping would emergein Britain made up of Greens and others who had seen the Light. The Green Party,I was told, should be developing policies for a time of economic collapse, andthese should include plans for barter economies based on local communities. Thereference to ‘those who will rule’ after the present order has gone were soulswho had incarnated for this purpose, although most did not yet realise that. Apiece of automatic writing to the sensitive in Northamptonshire spoke of “Onewith unearthly experience”, who would appear early in the next century, to “holdthe hand of humanity”.We can expect to see people acting strangely and behaving completely out ofcharacter. This is the result of them tuning to the new vibrations and seeinglife differently, or struggling to tune in and becoming confused, bewildered anddisorientated. We are likely to see this manifest in gathering conflict aroundthe world. There will be health effects, too, with diseases such as AIDSrampant, particularly in Africa, by 1993. New diseases will emerge and otherswill fade as the energies change. People’s health and behaviour will make itvery clear who is tuning in and who is not, and we must give all the help andsupport we can to those who are finding it difficult. All the old certaintiesand stabilities will disappear in the changeover period, and getting ourselvestogether in groups to support each other is vital. Children are the ones whowill adapt best because most of their souls will have incarnated specificallyfor the new age and they will find it easier to follow the quickeningvibrations.As the vibrations speed up, so does time as we measure it. When people say,“there are not enough hours in the day to do everything anymore”, they areright. It is important we recognise this and stop trying to do all we have donein the past. We must simplify our lives. If we don’t, we will burn ourselves outmentally and physically because, unknown to us, the days are getting shorter andwill continue to do so. I was warned by the Avatar that I would find that timepassed incredibly quickly, perhaps frighteningly so, and this was a reference tothe phenomena I have described.The great institutions in our modern societies will fall, including the Britishmonachy and the traditional churches in their present form. They will onlysurvive at all if they adapt their thinking radically and immediately toencompass the spiritual truths of reincarnation and karma which are about toreturn to Western spiritual life after their years in the wilderness. The newspirituality involves a one-to-one relationship with the Godhead and the higherintelligences. We will no longer believe that all our sins can be forgiven by apriest appointed by the Church hierarchy. Why do we need a human to arbitratebetween ourselves and God when we have our own personal link? We should stillmeet together for our spiritual ceremonies because numbers add to the power, butit will be very different to what we see today. The traditional Churches willcrumble.All life-forms will be affected by the new vibrations and geological events.Some are likely to become extinct as their habitats change. A communication toDeborah Shaw in Canada said the African elephant, the blue whale, the osprey andthe panda will not be with us beyond the end of the decade. Their species aregoing out of evolution and their souls will return in other species. There willbe new ones emerging with the new frequencies, and it will be the same with theplant kingdom. But it has been stressed that we must protect the dolphin, whichis the most highly evolved of the earth’s animal and marine life. The dolphinsare the last link with the sound system of Atlantis, and if they disappear it isgoing to be much more difficult for us to learn how to communicate with theanimals. Research into dolphins and their sounds hold the key to thisunderstanding. It is hard to believe, but true, that there was a time on Earthwhen animals did not attack humans. We were friends. It was only when we lostthe sense of oneness that fear of humans brought the divisions between us.It is impossible to say exactly what the geological impact will be because theforecasts are constantly changing as humankind wields its collective free will.What is certain is that we will have earthquakes and volcanoes of a power beyondmodern human experience along with breathtaking weather extremes. It is alsocertain that this is all linked to the individual and collective karma ofhumanity, and we can work through that karma by turning to the Light or byexperiencing tough lessons of our own creation. It would appear, at the time ofwriting, that we are in for an axis shift and a shift of both the magnetic andphysical poles. This would seem to be supported in Revelations, the last book ofthe Bible. Revelations is not about one period but the evolution of humankind,and I know that we are approaching the point when the sixth seal will be opened:And I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal. There was a violent earthquake andthe sun became black like coarse black cloth and the moon turned completely redlike blood. The stars fell down to the earth, like unripe figs falling from thetree when a strong wind shakes it. The sky disappeared like a scroll beingrolled up and every mountain and island was moved from its place.That would appear to be a description of how an axis shift would look and feelto those on earth at the time.A session with Rakorczy and members of his team, communicating through Joan inWales, gave us an explanation of at least part of what is happening. Everythinghas positive-negative polarities. Planets go through periods when they arepositive or negative in their relationships with other planets. Each one islinked to another of an opposite polarity, and as their energies pass betweenthem they try to find the balance between the two. The earth has been goingthrough a positive stage, and the negative balance has come from a planet calledConstabor in another solar system – this link with Constabor was also givenindependently to another source. Every time you move up to another level ofevolution, the poles switch around. The Earth is changing polarities andConstabor is doing the same. It is this, we were told, that will bring about theshift in the magnetic poles and, as a consequence, the axis tilt.As with the human body, the changes in the physical Earth come some time afterthe changes in the organising blueprint of the etheric body. Rakorczy and histeam said the pole shift and axis tilt would happen in the etheric blueprint inAutumn 1994 or, if we help the Earth between now and then, Autumn 1995. Thelater date would be better because it would cause less damage. This, in turn,would lead to a pole shift and axis tilt on the physical body, the one we seeand live on, in either 1998 or 1999. It was due to be an axis movement of 10%,but, thanks to the recent improvement in human thought-patterns, it is now dueto be 5%.The messages said the Earth’s core was changing its composition. It is currentlya liquid crystal with energy-particles of iron. This creates the planet’selectromagnetic field and gives the earth her positive polarity in therelationship with Constabor. The iron is gradually being replaced by theenergy-particles of berkelium3 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos290657],which would give the Earth a negative polarity. This would enhance her female,receptive, spiritual aspects and it would have a similar effect on us also. Partof the phasing-in process involves the use of radioactive radon gas in the core,and you may know that radon gas has been causing problems in some areas. Thiswill increase in the transition period.The Earth wobbles on her axis and this, we were told, was the result of theEarth-spirit not being able to control and balance the conflicting forces aroundher. The time would come when the Earth would have no wobble, she would spin ona perfect upright axis. Now whether all that came across the frequencies inexactly the form it was sent we shall have to wait and see, but the generaltheme is beyond doubt.There will be massive earth movements, volcanoes and great extremes of weather.As things currently stand, we can expect to see signs of this by 1992, andparticularly during 1993-94. This cleansing will also lead to many apparentlyinexplicable fires at sacred sites and key power-centres around the world, toremove sources of imbalance. There was specific mention of one major fire we canexpect in the north of England, the ‘Kingdom of the Brigantes’, though this onewill not necessarily be on sacred ground: “There will be a great fire which willlast for many days, and many will be needed from other parts of the world tobring it under control”.Every solstice from now on will see the pace of change quicken in its effect onall forms of life. The axis and pole shifts will cause fantastic winds in thedays it will take for stability to return and there will be more earth movementsand eruptions to relieve the pressure as everything re-tunes to the new regime.Sea rises, like the winds, have been mentioned many times in communications.They will take the form, in part, of tidal waves caused by the axis tilt, thepole shift, and the earth movements.I was led to a book which explained the background to earthquake- andvolcano-induced tidal waves. In some parts of the world the water table has beenlowered while pollution has been cleared and the earth cured of what wasdescribed as a sort of leukaemia, cancer of the blood, or, in this case, of thewater channels which carry the energy. This will mean that in some regions therewill be a lot of rain and flooding as the water is returned while in others,said a communication to the Northamptonshire source, “there will be new areas ofdrought as the Earth empties her deepest caverns to prepare for the new flows ofenergy”. Messages have said that the damage from all these events would appearto be random, but in fact it would relate to the karma of a country or region interms of its treatment of the planet and all forms of life. For instance, weshould expect to see those areas involved in taking oil to be prevented fromdoing so. This god of the material world is a vital lubricant which the Earthmust have, and too much has been taken already by our insatiable system. The oilbusiness will soon be history.Precisely how the world will change, how quickly and on what scale, is still notknown and, I repeat, the exact details and timings are subject to revisiondepending on how we react. But change there will be, and of a kind we could notbegin to comprehend as we look around us today.Whoever we are and whatever we are, the quickening vibrations of Aquarius cannotbe ignored."},{"pageContent":"10The MessageThe great souls we have been working with have made it clear many times thatthere is a tremendous amount we can do to help ourselves and the planet throughthis period and reduce, perhaps dramatically, the scale and impact of thegeological events.The first thing we must do is avoid self-condemnation or the condemnation ofthose we perceive to be most responsible for guiding us down the wrong path.Most of them did not mislead us through malice, but because they, themselves,were misled. Over many lives we are all responsible for the misunderstandingsand lost spiritual truths of reincarnation, karma, the energy-system, and anon-judgmental God. We should be seeking solutions, not scapegoats.The way forward is, as ever, through love, peace and forgiveness. Unconditionallove, unconditional peace, unconditional forgiveness. And the first step toforgiving others is to forgive ourselves, to love ourselves, and to make peacewith ourselves. Guilt is a destructive emotion and we should be rid of it beforewe go any further. We know we have done wrong, but we must not live in the pastor even in the future, but the present, the Now. This is the first day of therest of our eternity. As the Avatar said:Man should not experience guilt. He needs to acknowledge wrong and put thingsright where he can. He should ask for forgiveness and forgive himself. Guilt isman-made to stop man reaching his spiritual potential. This has developed sincethe crumbling of Atlantis and all ancient civilisations. This germ has takenhold and we must eliminate that germ of guilt. How can we love the Earth and ourpeople? We love ourselves.This kind of love is rather deeper than standing in front of a mirror admiringthe reflection. It is not, either, to ignore the things we and others do. It isto love ourselves unconditionally; to accept that we are not perfect, and whilewe always search for perfection, we know that we will often fall short of whatwe might desire; it is to rid ourselves of our guilt, fears and insecurities,which shield us from our real selves, that spark of Light deep within us thatknows who we really are. Let that Light shine and radiate through us and thedarkness shall fade away. If we can do that the darkness shall lift from theEarth, also.If we want to change the world, we have to change ourselves. It is our ownguilt, fear and dislike of ourselves that makes us attack others for displayingthe very faults that we wish we could banish from our own personalities. Once weare at peace with ourselves and love ourselves for what we are, imperfectionsand all, we will be in a position to love others with their imperfections. Thisis important, not only for the harmony of the human race, but also for the Earthas she goes through her traumatic transition.One message from Rakorczy summed up the main problem for the Earth: “She isfeeling unloved”. She is not alone in that. All of humanity is feeling unloved,and so are the animals, the plants, and the rocks, as they have been exploitedin the chase for the mythical utopia called ‘economic expansion’. The darkenergy-forms that our aggression, anger, fear and resentment have created arethe most destructive contribution we have made to the planet’s decline. Itfollows that the best way we can help the Earth-spirit through this period is toreplace the darkness with Light. Hence, love, peace and forgiveness mustprevail.The law of like-attracts-like means that dark energy-forms attract others of thesame kind, and this can create a massive cloud of darkness. It is a sort ofspiritual magnetism at work. People can find themselves tapping into those darkenergy clouds and having their attitudes and behaviour affected as aconsequence. This is how dictators like Hitler can assemble nations behind theircreed of hatred. The minds of people tune to these fields of darkness, and themore they do, and the more their own thoughts are affected, the bigger the cloudbecomes. This leads to war and conflict, and leaves the Earth’s energysystem inruins.But Light also attracts Light, and that is the way we can shield the Earth fromthe darkness and give her the strength to go through her changes with the leastpossible turmoil. The Earth is a living being, with feelings and emotions and,as many communications have said, she is struggling to cope with the pressure.Imagine how we would be feeling if we were going through such a transition whilephysically and mentally drained, and with our blood supply diminished. Don’t letanyone tell you that the Earth does not feel all the pain and anguish of whathas been done to her.Communications from Rakorczy and others have said that the strange weatherpatterns we have experienced in every part of the world are the result of theEarth-spirit suffering the effects of, particularly, emotional pressures. She isbecoming confused. This is making her lose control, and the natural order of theplanet is failing. As with the human form, upsets in the mental and emotionalbodies disrupt the etheric organisation, and so affect the physical. We have hadsome highly destructive winds in Britain and Europe in recent years, and we canexpect the power and frequency of hurricanes to increase. A message said therewould be a severe hurricane around the Gulf of Mexico and New Orleans. Automaticwriting to the Kenilworth source contained further warnings:You must tell your friends on the other side of the world (New Zealand) thattheir small homes must be protected against wind, as the storms will gatheraround their islands and do great damage. In many other places the waters havebegun to lift and much land will soon be no more. Not enough work has been doneto protect your big city (London), and there will be many who are blamed andwill lose their responsibilities as a result. In the East (of the world) thefloods will soon begin and the storms will rage across the southern ocean. Inthe north the land becomes very cold as the winter snow and ice covers theground. Here there will be many problems with food delivery and transport andmany countries will be asked to help, or people will starve.In the south (of Britain), the rains will fall heavily and inundate many areas…The east of your country will be very badly affected, and much of your fertileland will disappear…In the north, strong winds will be the greatest hazard and, in particular, largeamounts of snow will fall and lie on the ground for many months.Your transport system will be badly affected and it will be necessary foreveryone to store up their food supplies, as the power circuits will not operatefor some time.In the west, there will be large amounts of rain and snow, and the sea will riseand cover a considerable area.These communications were received in October and November 1990. I must stress,again, however, that how bad they are, or even if some of them come to pass atall, depends on how we conduct ourselves. What we can say is that, as thingscurrently stand, the world will be faced with severe and, in modern times,unprecedented weather conditions, and these will be caused by the mental andemotional turmoil the Earth-spirit is going through and the energy changesaround the planet as the vibrations quicken. You can see why so many of us arebeing asked to work on the Earth’s mind and emotions. If they can be settleddown, it will be better for everyone. The scale of the damage of all typesdepends to a significant extent on the Earth-spirit’s ability to maintaincontrol under enormous pressure.The series of messages which explained the changes in the core also emphasisedthe importance of the Earth’s emotional health. The shock of the axis and poleshifts would, we were told, cause the Earth-spirit to lose consciousness for oneor two days, and daylight would disappear from the planet for that period. Lightis also an energy-frequency and would be affected when the Earth-spirit goesinto her short coma. When she regained consciousness, the messages said, shewould be confused and bewildered, and order would take some time to return. Allthese things could be eased if humans were determined enough and far-sightedenough to help the Earth-spirit now.I have heard some people offer the opinion that there is nothing we can do. Itis all pre-ordained, they say. But that is overwhelmingly not the case with thecommunications I have seen and heard. Quite the opposite, in fact. We can givethe Earth emotional and physical strength if we spend a few minutes every daysending her love and Light. All you have to do is visualise the Earth-spirit inany way you feel right, and imagine a stream of bright Light and love pouringdown to her. See the darkness around her lifting away, leaving her surroundedwith pulsating white or golden Light. It is important, nay crucial, I am told,for us to send the Light to the centre, the spiritual heart of the earth.Much love-energy has been spread on the surface of the planet as a result of theGreen movement and concern for the environment since the mid-eighties. This iswonderful and necessary, but it is the Earth-spirit, or the Dynos as some preferto call her, which is in most desperate need of love and Light. I know all ofthis might sound ridiculous to some people, probably the majority at the moment,but I hope that many will begin to appreciate how thoughts create the veryevents they visualise. It happens instantly on the non-physical planes, andeventually on the physical. It is even better if you can get your friends to doit with you. Hold hands in a ring, and the power of your thought-energy will bemuch increased. I would urge that everyone organising any event large or smallshould include a few minutes at the beginning or end to go through the ceremonyof sending love and Light to the Earth.Under spiritual guidance there are groups of people throughout the world who arebuilding a network of Light, sending out love and peace to the Earth, herpeople, and all her creatures. Among them is Fountain International, which isbased in Britain4 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos292117]. Join them andhelp them to build a network of Light that no darkness can breach. Just becareful, though, of what organisations you get involved with. Check them out.Not everything that calls itself ‘New Age’ is desirable. Some of it is not.Walking around in a spiritual daze and ignoring the practical necessities oflife on a physical plane is of little use to anyone. It is balance we aresearching for.Visualise the shields of darkness lifting from the energy-lines around andthrough the earth. See the Light flowing unchallenged through the ley-lines andthe whole planet glowing with brilliant Light. Send Light and love to theanimals, the plants, the devas, and the rocks. Send it to anyone and any placethat might be surrounded by the emotions of darkness. This is particularlyneeded, for example, in war zones and at meat and poultry factories,slaughterhouses, factory farms, and other buildings and sites where there isfear and suffering. Visualise such places, and those who work and fight in themglowing with the Light of love. We will change their attitudes far more quicklyand effectively this way than by hurling abuse at them. It is the same withthose who work in animal experimental laboratories.This is something I hope that all campaigners and groups will come to acceptsoon. Many already have. Even when we are trying to stop bad things happening,we should not meet anger with anger or hatred with hatred. All you get that wayis double the anger, double the hatred, and a bigger cloud of darkness. This isjust what the darkness wants. Darkness can’t cope with Light, darkness prefersmore darkness. So we must meet aggression and hate with peace and love in largeenough amounts, if the Light is to triumph.I was guided into and out of the ‘angry young man’ stage myself in this life toshow me it didn’t work and make me receptive to these truths. I have known ofpeople who have changed their attitudes when, unknown to them, someone has beensending them thought-forms of love. The best way to change aggressors anddictators is not by war and bitterness. It is through visualising these peopleand their countries bathed in the Light of love. If enough of us do this, we candisperse the dark energies they are tuning into, and their outlook on life willchange. They won’t be able to help themselves, for their source of darkness willhave gone. I know that many people have been doing this for the countries ofEastern Europe for many years. This must be stepped up massively from now onwhenever there is conflict, anger and hatred. The dark forces are workingthrough all potential aggressors and often through those who oppose theiraggression, too, to bring about war.The next step for the Green Movement is to encompass this spiritual dimensionmore completely. If the pressure groups take the purely physical approach basedon the limitations of current scientific thinking, they will be telling onlyhalf the story. The key threat to the Earth will go on being ignored. It istime, I would suggest, that the movement turned its collective mind to theEarth’s energy-system, and sought protection for power centres, ley-lines andsacred sites.Everything we need to do to help the Earth and ourselves comes down to love,peace and forgiveness. Whatever the mixture of the seven rays we receive onearth, they can always be balanced by ray two, love and wisdom. If we tune tothis ray we automatically receive the best aspects, and avoid the worst, of allthe others. This happens as a matter of course once we allow love, peace,forgiveness, tolerance, understanding, sharing, caring, and respect for othersto dominate our values. The Avatar put it like this:Send out love through thoughts and acts, write down words of love, eliminateviolence of any level, whether mental, physical or emotional. Gentleness withinthe temple of our soul needs to shine through the windows of our eyes… There ismuch divine joy around us, and beauty of inexplicable abundance, if we can liftour faces upwards and let the Light of God shine upon us.And as this book was being completed a message was channelled through DeborahShaw in Canada, which emphasised the power of love and the meaning of life:Every wave that breaks upon the shore, every drop of rain, every puff of wind,is all part of the Creator’s Plan and contributes to life. Karma is not aboutrecriminations, it is our opportunity to learn to love, expand, learn, and loveagain.If people suffer physically as a result of what is to come, that is part oftheir karma. We need, each one of us, to look inwards and learn to accept whatis being offered to us. How we act on this information is entirely up to us. Butwe cannot lose because the Creator loves each one of us as if there was only oneof us. Yesterday is gone, tomorrow doesn’t exist – we need to accept Now. Toaccept, because only to want good karma to come our way is not to learn, but toallow our personalities to prevent our souls supporting, guiding and serving ourneeds.Every karmic experience leaves an impression on our soul. When this happens thebridge of learning is crossed and we then allow our soul to serve us by movingus to the next karmic experience. If we trust our Maker and open our hearts tolove, we will learn divine acceptance. This is what Jesus meant by ‘turn theother cheek’. Do not worry about the future.Whatever you need you will be guided to. If you give generously and help othersto prosper, you will prosper. It may not seem obvious to you because we havepersonalities and egos that interfere. Release all fear and doubt, and when youlie down tonight before you go to sleep, say “I accept every minute and I willlive it to the full to the best of my ability”.If you open the window in your heart to allow love to flow in, the freedom isindescribable and will guide you for all your days. If you mistrust what ourCreator has in store, you will experience mistrust towards others and fromothers. Everything you do to others, you are actually doing to yourself, becausekarma will make you play out the situation again.Acceptance is the key to your identity. This is true for all of us. This harmonyis the inner peace that comes as you realise that all you need to survive willbe drawn to you. You will all see with a new clarity, and so you will be able tosolve problems with ease. Life will be wonderful. Leave the past and negativeissues behind, and focus on all you believe to be good.In the light of this truth, we will build our new planet. Keep this visionalways in your sights and love your opposition unconditionally.The message is: Love life and help others to love life. Be happy and make othershappy. This is somewhat preferable, I would suggest, to what we see around ustoday. It is not an environmental crisis that we have first and foremost, nor acrisis of injustice, nor of peace, nor of cruelty. They are the by-products ofthe real crisis that faces us – the crisis of the human spirit. We will onlysolve those ills if we remove the cause of them, and the cause is that thespiritual truths that hold all the answers have been lost.This can be seen clearly in the way we see people: not by what they are, but bywhat they own; not by how they care, but by what they wear; not by the size oftheir heart, but the size of their house. They have become the collective statussymbols of the culture that controls the world, a culture that turns out moresuicide, drug-taking, alcoholism and violence in all its forms andmanifestations every year. A spiritual renaissance is long overdue.The changes unfolding in this decade had to come, not only because the nextstage of evolution is due, but to save us from ourselves. The alternative wasthe elimination of the planet well within the lifetimes of people alive today.Instead we are being offered a way out of the mess we have engineered, and ourguides are the spiritual truths we have long forgotten.By the time you read this, my consciousness will have been expanded further andI might know and understand more, but for now I can only say that the earth andhumanity are in the process of transformation and we are being lifted as gentlyas possible to the next rung of evolution. It will not be without its manyupsets and difficulties as we climb the last few steps, but the potential isthere for a new and glorious tomorrow if we choose to take it.The true potential of the Aquarian age will not be realised within the physicallifetimes of those on Earth today. The age won’t be in its prime until at leastthe year 2500, and we will have to reincarnate to savour the full benefit ofwhat we are about to do. But we can build the foundations for those who willfollow us and we can watch the old delusions fading into history as we viewcreation with a new wonder and understanding. In the new age we will have thepower to create the new Atlantis, and we will be given tremendous help andsupport from the entire solar system and beyond.They will pass on to us, through thought-forms, the means to develop the newtechnologies. This is what I call ‘the Eureka Factor’ because thought-forms fromthe forces of Light and darkness are a source of our technological inspiration.We will also be able to manifest and de-manifest matter through sound. We willbe able to levitate. We will use telepathy as we now use the telephone. Therewill be communication with the animals, devas and extra-terrestrials. Healingwill be by natural methods and we will have little need for surgery. Colours areenergy-frequencies, and as the vibrations quicken so the colours will becomesharper, more brilliant, and there will be more shades. We will have more soundsfor our music. There will be no need to use fossil fuels as we discover othersources of energy. The list goes on and on, and all of it can be ours.But even as the new vibrations are phased in and attitudes change, I know thatwhat I have said in these ten chapters will be met with much laughter, ridiculeand condemnation. I have been left in no doubt whatsoever about the scale of theopposition I will face. I knew that when I began, and I am prepared for whatevermay come. I do ask, however, that these words be met with open eyes and openhearts. No one is saying you must believe them. The traditional churches haveput forward their view for 1500 years and they have every right to do so. I amoffering another view; people must decide which they choose to believe.Martin Luther King said that unarmed truth was the most powerful force in theuniverse, and he was right. You have been reading the first instalment of thatunarmed truth. As the energies increase their tempo and our consciousness israised to new heights, the basis of what I have said will be the conventionalwisdom before too many years have passed. When that becomes the case, the fearof death will be replaced by the love of life, and as the darkness gives way toLight, the human race will enter-adulthood and the Earth shall smile again. Inthe words of the poet, Shelley:A brighter dawn awaits the human day,When poverty and wealth, the thirst of fame,The fear of infamy, disease and woe,War with its million horrors and fierce hell,Shall live, but in the memory of time.That dawn is set before us in the Aquarian age, and we can make that dreamreality. We can replace suffering with joy, sadness with laughter, the emptinessof materialism with a new spiritual vision. We will have the power and the meansto do each of these things if we want them badly enough. All we have to do isopen our minds, open our hearts, and tune into the new tomorrow. We have beenthe lost sons and daughters of the Divine Family for long enough. It is time togo home."},{"pageContent":"Notes(1) [../Text/index_split_008.html#filepos161273] For those particularlyinterested in healing, Vibrational Medicine by Richard Gerber MD: Bear and Co,USA.(2) [../Text/index_split_010.html#filepos234584] See Prof. Fida Hassnain’s ASearch for the Historical Jesus: Gateway Books, 1993.(3) [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos261796] I have used the name berkeliumbecause that is the nearest chemical element to the one being introduced to thecore. Berkelium was so named because it was prepared and identified at theradiation laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley in 1949. It wasthought to be a human-made substance, but, apparently, something close to itoccurs naturally within the earth. I use the name berkelium in that context. Theiron will be fully replaced by the berkelium by early in the next century, butthe poles will shift at the point when the negative energy-particles ofberkelium overtake the influence of the positive iron. The Earth-spirit isresponsible for controlling the balancing act, and how well this is done willdecide if the etheric pole shift and axis tilt will be in 1994 or 95, and thephysical in 98 or 99, said the communication. We were told that the scale of theaxis tilt had been halved because of a 60% improvement in human consciousnessbetween 1986 and 1990. This was a 60% improvement for humanity as a whole andnot every individual. Some had made rapid progress while others had hardlymoved. This new awareness and concern for the planet had, through thethought-energy it produced, strengthened the emotional health of the Earthenough to ensure the axis movement would be less than originally expected.(4) [../Text/index_split_012.html#filepos276922] The address for FountainInternational is: PO Box 52, Torquay, Devon TQ2 8PE (stamped addressed envelopeplease)."},{"pageContent":"OTHER BOOKS BY DAVID ICKEIt doesn’t Have to be Like This (GreenPrint)Heal The World (Gateway)Love Changes Everything (Thorsons)In the Light of Experience: autobiography (Warner)Days of Decision (Carpenter): also available as a cassette (Gateway)"},{"pageContent":"Gill & MacmillanHume AvenuePark WestDublin 12Irelandwww.gillmacmillanbooks.ie [http://www.gillmacmillanbooks.ie]© David Icke 1991, 1993, 2014First published by Gateway, an imprint of Gill & Macmillan 1993This ebook edition published by Gill & Macmillan 2014978 18586 0006 2 (print)978 07171 6349 6 (epub)978 07171 6348 9 (mobi)Cover design by Studio B of BristolCover illustrations by Jackie MorrisAll rights reserved.
