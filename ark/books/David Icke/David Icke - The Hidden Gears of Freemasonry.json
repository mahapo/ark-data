[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" The Hidden Gears of Freemasonry The Hidden Gears of FreemasonryThe Hidden Gears of Freemasonry The Hidden Gears of Freemasonry There is a Masonic organization within the world most know nothing about. Those who are familiar with Freemasonry only see the \"good works\" organization. Freemasonry occasionally holds benefits for Children's Hospitals, and various other organizations to raise money for the cause. What this does is it keeps peoples minds off of what is going on WITHIN THE WALLS of Freemasonry and reinforces the thought that Freemasonry is a \"good works\" organization. Freemasonry is like a *school building*. Everybody can see the outside of it which looks perfectly innocent. People who join Masonry go to this school not realizing the education they receive from it is designed to mislead and to keep members unaware of certain things. The information which would reveal the truth to them is withheld. Most members assume that it is a \"good works\" organization from its public image that is already in place so they do not question it. We see this echoed within the public education system wh ich d oes not teach chil dren ab out Masonic influences within the United States Presidency, Government, big business and other countries, . . no one even questions it either. People are unaware. . . I went through the U.S. Education system. I certainly wasn't taught that Freemasonry was behind the Luciferic design in Washington D.C. Some Masons may not even be aware of that fact because they went through the same education system I did. I also wasn't aware that Masonry had such a large influence in the U.S. Presidency both past and present. People who have been born into this world do not realize that they have been taught falsehoods and deprived of certain informations which are vital to their freedom. Thirty three is the highest degree obtainable within Masonry. You can be a 33rd degree Mason with a P.H.D. and still be lied to by your Lodg e. The Tumb ling D omino Effect doesn't ju st app ly to the church, it also applies to the Masonic Lodge as well. It is possible for the educated such as a Ph.D., doctor, lawyer, businessman, journalist, scientist, accountant or even a Ma son to be uneducated. As mentioned on anoth er pag e, there is a differe nce between vocational training and true education, and it has been cleverly blurred. And the reason for this is? It is so that people can successfully practice their vocations while at the same time remain totally ignorant of the larger issues of the world in which they live. There are two types of Masons. • TYPE 1; A Mason who is unaware of certain facts regarding the subject and may not be Satanic. • TYPE 2; A Mason who KNOWS the truth and is trying to keep the first type and the general public from realizing it. This Mason is Satanic. (ELITE Mason) Some Masons proclaim that Freemasonry is NOT Satanic. These Masons can fall under the description of both types. We must also be very careful with this Mason as well. This Mason might be of TYPE 2 and disguising himself as TYPE 1. Some Masonic Lodges MAY NOT have any members who are of TYPE 2. Therefore that Lodge could be innocent. However, there are Lodges in the world which ARE run by TYPE 2. Because of this, if"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"one says Freemasonry is Satanic, they are correct. If one says Freemasonry is not, they are correct as well. \"ELITE Freemason\" refers to someone who is recognized as being involved with the hidden gears of Freemasonry. This Mason is of TYPE 2 and has revealed themselves to us through the books they have wr itt en. He is a lso aware of the Luciferic design in Was hington D.C. and all the o ther secre ts associated with world control. TWO ORGANIZATIONS, ONE VISIBLE, THE OTHER INVISIBLE Researching this subject is like stripping away the paint and plaster from the walls of Freemasonry (school building). Take out a couple of bricks and you will see the truth, the invisible gears of Freemasonry. The engine which powers their global control system. As they turn, they mesh together to accomplish their agendas. The reason why politicians never seem to do what the people who voted them into office want is because of these agendas. An agenda is consistent with a secret society. A secret society whose plan is already laid out. Predetermined. Those gears were turning all through history right out in the open for all to see but very few even noticed. Just look at how many Masonic Presidents the United States has had. To the voter all a politician is is someone who follows their own agendas. This is perfectly consistent with a secret society, an organization which operates through the invisible gears of Freemasonry. The visible \"good works\" organization is deliberately lied to and mislead with false interpretations by the invisible organization. The invisible organization knows the truth and is comprised of ELITE Masons. This two dimensional organization is described by Manly P. Hall (who is a Mason himself). Hall was honored by The Scottish Rite Journal, who called Hall 'The Illustrious Manly P. Hall' in September, 1990, and further called him 'Masonry's Greatest Philosopher', saying \"The world is a far better place because of Manly Palmer Hall, and we are better persons for having known him and his work\"]. Manly P. Hall said: \"Freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity -- an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood of the elect ... it is necessary to establish the existence of these two separate and yet interdependent orders, the one visible and the other invisible. The visible society is a splendid camaraderie of 'free and accepted' men enjoined to devote themselves to ethical, educational, fraternal, patriotic, and humanitarian concerns. The invisible society is a secret and most August [defined as 'of majestic dignity, grandeur'] fraternity whose members are dedicated to the service of a mysterious arcannum arcandrum [defined as 'a secret, a mystery'].\" [Hall, Lectures on Ancient Philosophy, p. 433] There are many men within Freemasonry who are well-meaning and they make up the VISIBLE or \"good works\" organization of Freemasonry. They also have no knowledge of the INVISIBLE organization within Freemasonry. Albert Pike said something VERY interesting concerning the brethren in the visible society: \"Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism, and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be mislead; to conceal the Truth, which it calls light, and draw them away from it.\" [Morals and Dogma, p. 104-5, 3rd Degree] Albert Pike specifically says in the above quote that Masonry is a religion after the order of the Satanic Mysteries, the equally Satanic Hermetic Philosophy, and Alchemy. Freemasonry like the public education system was designed to conceal certain secrets from the brethren in the visible organization. The ELITE Masons are the ones who know the truth. This again is consistent with a secret society because there is a hidden agenda. Of course it also explains why politicians have their own agendas, they are controlled by the ELITE Mason. The brethren in the visible organization are spoon-fed \"false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols\" -- for what reason? -- those brethren in the visible organization \"deserve only to be mislead\". If a man were to make it known to his fellow brethren that he believes in Jesus Christ he would immediately be placed into the VISIBLE organization of Freemasonry. He would never learn the truth either unless he researched this subject independently. This man wouldn't be considered an Adept, or a Sage, or on of the Elect. Those terms are reserved for the members of the INVISIBLE organization. You would be one of those who were deliberately lied to about the doctrines of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Masonry, and given deliberate misinterpretations of its symbols, so that you would merely THINK you knew the Truth. \"So Masonry jealously conceals its secrets and intentionally leads conceited interpreters astray.\" [Ibid., p. 105] With that Pike completes his instructions to intentionally mislead members of the visible organization. The term \"masses\" refers to those who are members of the VISIBLE organization and it comprises of 95% of all Masons. Listen to what Pike says about telling the truth of the organization to the 'masses': \"A Spirit\", he said, \"that loves wisdom and contemplates the Truth close at hand, is forced to disguise it, to induce the multitudes [that is you] to accept it ... Fictions are necessary to the people, and the Truth becomes deadly to those who are not strong enough to contemplate it in all its brilliance.\" [Morals and Dogma, p. 103, 3rd Degree; Emphasis added] If a person is not capable of accepting the Truth that inner-core, invisible Freemasonry really worships and serves Satan, then such Truth would become \"deadly\" to you. Therefore, \"fictions are necessary\" so visible Masons would not be so devastated that they would leave Freemasonry and expose its inner secrets. There IS one short paragraph that properly and concisely defines the heart and soul of the Invisible Fraternity of Freemasonry. Let us return to Manly P. Hall for this quote: \"When a Mason learns the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his Craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy.\" [The Lost Keys To Freemasonry, Manly P. Hall, published by the Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company, Inc., Richmond, Virginia, 1976, p. 48; Emphasis added] The Scottish Rite Journal praised Manly P. Hall in 1990 as \"Masonry's Greatest Philosopher\". Some Masons may not have ever heard of Manly P. Hall; yet you can see his book was published by the Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company. The only reason this high-ranking Mason had never heard of Manly P. Hall is that Hall was a leader of the Invisible Fraternity, while this Mason was participating in the Visible Fraternity! I hope you understand just what it is I am teaching you here. A majority of Masons have been kept in IGNORANCE all along. If you would like to go further you can go to the publishing and distribution house of Invisible Freemaso nry, Kessinger's Freemaso nry a nd Occ ult Publi shing ; Kessinger's publishes all the old, formerly very secret Masonic books of the Invisible Society. You are encouraged to pursue the subjects they have listed at the very bottom of their Home Page, noting the extremely Satanic, anti-Christian subjects of which the Invisible Fraternity is comprised. Below are a few of these subjects as Kessinger's has listed them: THIS is the heart and soul of the Invisible, Inner Fraternity. The absolute darkest part of this heart is Phallicism, worshipping the erect Male Sex Organ. The obelisk is the major symbol for this worship, which is why you see obelisks everywhere associated with Freemasonry! It is time to stop being deceived, don't you think?! Listen to Albert Pike speak of the obelisk: \"Hence the significancy of the phallus, or of its inoffensive substitute, the obelisk, rising as an emblem of the resurrection by the tomb of buried Deity ...\" [Morals and Dogma, p. 393] Now, you know why you see so many obelisks atop the graves of Freemasons, for it is \"an emblem of the resurrection of buried Deity\"; the Invisible Mason believes he is becoming a god throughout his life, so the obelisk at his grave is simply the visible manifestation of that belief. The obelisk was originally created by the Egyptian Mysteries of the Pharaohs, and is spoken of in the Bible. Listen: \"... King Jehu said to the guards and to the officers, 'Go in and slay them; let none escape'. And they smote them with the sword; and the guards before the king threw their bodies out, and went into the inner dwelling of the house of Baal. They brought out the obelisks of the house of Baal and burned them.\" [2 Kings 10:26, Amplified Bible] God Almighty ordered the Satanic obelisks burned, but only after He ordered King Jehu to slaughter the worshippers of the obelisk, also known as Baal worshippers. Thus, the Invisible Freemasonry is devoted to the obelisk worship so forbidden by God as to be worthy of the Death Penalty. Keep this in mind the next time you contemplate the Washington Monument! Finally, Serpent Worship takes us directly into Hell itself, for Satan stands directly behind this form of worship. This is the Invisible Fraternity of Freemasonry, and I bet you never knew it existed, did you? "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Washington D.C. and Masonic/Luciferic Symbology.

They live among us, controlling us via mind control tactics. I would trust that you would study the entire site, it has plenty to offer. As you can see on the back of the U.S. one dollar bill there is a pyramid with the All-Seeing-Eye of God, with the message, \"New Order of The Ages\" or \"New World Order.\" You are about to learn that the U.S. Government is linked to Satanism. You have already learned that the U.S. Government is linked to several other governments and the church. And that it is all run by the secret society Brotherhood. The street design in Washington, D.C., has been laid out in such a manner that certain Luciferic symbols are depicted by the streets, cul-de-sacs and rotaries. This design was created in 1791, a few years after Freemasonry assumed the leadership of the New World Order, in 1782. In Europe, occult leaders were told by their Familiar Spirits as early as the 1740's that the new American continent was to be established as the new \"Atlantis\", and its destiny was to assume the global leadership of the drive to the New World Order. The United States of America was chosen to lead the world into this kingdom of Antichrist from the beginning. The capital is Washington, D.C. In 1791, Pierre Charles L'Enfante (the designer, who was a Freemason), laid out Governmental Center of Washington, D.C., he planned more than just streets, roads, and buildings. He hid certain occultic magical symbols in the layout of U.S. Governmental Center. When these symbols are united they become one large Luciferic, or occultic, symbol. Washington D.C. An untrained eye might not see the Luciferic connection in this map. The upper four points of the Goathead represent the four elements of the world, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. The bottom fifth point represents the spirit of Lucifer. All of which are represented in Washington D.C. (The United States Capital) Many people have natural tendencies to want to disbelieve unpleasant or frightening truths. Occultists take advantage of this. \"Audacity, always Audacity\", is a saying the Masters of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Illuminati have always had. Something shocking and so far out and considered to be impossible,...... is Audacity. People naturally feel that their leaders generally have their best interest at heart whether they be in a democracy or a government of royalty. Leaders may commit errors and may be incompetent. Some people may take solace in their belief that most leaders have their country's best interests at heart, most of the time. The average citizen in any given country could not conceive that their leaders may consistently have evil in their hearts. And this evil would be towards the very people they are leading. Since 1776, our leadership (U.S. Government) has been consistently moving us toward the Luciferic New World Order. This leadership has always been working through Secret Societies , misleading us as to their true intentions. This is why our study today is so CRITICAL!!!; it demonstrates, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that our leadership has knowingly and consistently been pursuing a hidden agenda which, when fully carried out, will mean the destruction of our nation(the U.S.) as we know it today and the beginning of the Biblical Great Tribulation. Our leaders are currently calling this system the New World Order! The U.S. Capital Building Once they are hidden, these occultic symbols are thought to possess great power. The Snake Basilisk is \" said to have the power to destroy all upon whom it looks \". To a person who is not an occultist, they will have no concept of the true hidden meaning contained within the symbol. And that hidden purpose is to communicate certain meanings to other occultists while hiding this meaning from all non-occultists. The symbols that were interwoven into the design of Governmental Center, communicate tremendous power to the occultist while at the same time they hide the true meaning from non- occultist. These symbols take on a life of their own, in the mind of the occultist, possessing great inherent power to accomplish the plans of the occultist. According to occultic/Satanic doctrine, the upper four points of the Goathead(left) represent the four elements of the world, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. The bottom fifth point represents the spirit of Lucifer. In the above photocopy of the Goathead Pentagram, the fifth point extends down into the mind of the goat, who represents Lucifer. With all that as background, let us now begin our study of Governmental Center, Washington, D.C. The Satanic symbol & the Masonic layout of Washington D.C.

"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" In the street layout of Washington D.C., the fifth point is the White House, a symbol placement which represents the in tention that the spirit and the mind of Lucifer will be permanently residing in the White House. The map I found isn't all that accura te as far as the streets are concerned, but it will have to do. The White House makes up the southern most tip of the Goathead. Lansat satellite image of the White House (below center) and surrounding northern area. In the map above, beginning from top left to top middle: 1. Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, and Scott Circle in the middle, form the top three points of the Devil's Goathead of Mendes, one of the most important types of the Five-pointed Devil's Pentagram. 2. Washington Circle forms the extreme left-hand point of the Goathead. 3. Mt. Vernon Square forms the extreme right-hand point of the Goathead. 4. The White House forms the fifth and bottom point of the Goathead. There is a 666 evident in the most important top three circles of the Goathead, Dupont Circle, Scott Circle, and Logan Circle. Each of these streets has six major streets coming into them from all angles of the circle. This type of encoding is so typical of the occultist. Everything was deliberately planned to stamp the power of Freemasonry and the symbols of its plans for America indelibly upon Government Center in Washington D.C. The combination of the the Goathead of Mendes, Devil's Pentagram, and the practical existence of the number 666 within the three upper points of the Pentagram, unmistakably shows that Lucifer is planned to be the ultimate master of Governmental Center. Dupont Circle Dupont Circle Dupont Circle Dupont Circle Scott Circle Scott Circle Scott Circle Scott Circle Satellite photos came from Microsoft's Terraserver. Now look for a moment at the circles which comprise the points of the Pentagram. Washington Circle, Dupont Circle, Scott Circle, and Logan Circle comprise four of the six points of the Pentagram. The only point which is not a circle or a form of a circle is Mt. Vernon Square. We shall return to the discussion of the importance of the square to the occultist, but let us now concentrate upon the circle. Logan Circle Logan Circle Logan Circle Logan Circle It is no secret as to why the Masonic architect chose to use circles as four of the points of the Pentagram. As Goodman states in his book, Magic Symbols, \" without doubt, the circle is the most"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"important of all units in magic symbolism, and in almost every case where it is used, the circle is intended to denote spirit, or spiritual forces \". Therefore, we can know with certainty that these circles of this Pentagram were used to denote powerful spiritual forces. And, of course, these spiritual forces are from Lucifer. Map of Washington D.C. with outlined Luciferic design. But, there is much more symbolism expressed by the circle in occultic thought. The circle has also been used as a halo above a person's head, denoting that \"he or she is in direct communication with the spiritual world\". The circle has also been utilized to represent the Sun, especially in spiritual terms, denoting spiritual light. But, the circle also is utilized as a symbol of the All-Seeing Eye. Remember the All- Seeing Eye atop the pyramid on the American One-Dollar bill? This eye is within a triangle, but the important factor to realize is that the eye is atop a pyramid. Of course, a pyramid is nothing more than a triangle. Look again at the triangles formed by the Goathead Pentagram. Four out of five triangles of the Goathead has a circle, representing the All-Seeing Eye atop each triangle. However, the architect had a problem with the triangle at the far right, because he chose the square as the anchor point; the solution is to place Thomas Circle at one of the points, thus giving that triangle an All-Seeing Eye. In fact, I believe this is the reason why Thomas Circle was placed in the odd position it was; it is the only circle which was not placed as an anchor of the Pentagram. Even the Southern Point of the Goathead Pentagram, the one which ends at the White House, has a circle at its top. Notice the Ellipse located just to the south of the White House lawn. (below) NORTH NORTH NORTH NORTH Lansat image of the White House Thus, the FreeMason architect who drew this pattern intended to show that Governmental Center was planned to be ruled by Satan. Further, the Goathead Pentagram was placed so the Southernmost point, the spiritual point, is precisely centered on the White House. Notice that I did not arbitrarily draw these lines to center on the White House; rather, the White House is the precise point where the two lines formed by Connecticut Avenue flowing from Dupont Circle, and by Vermont Avenue flowing from Logan Circle, intersect. The meaning is all too clear. Occultists planned for the White House to be controlled by Lucifer in accordance with his occultic power and doctrine. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" The Goathead.(for your reference) But, there is still more meaning expressed by this Goathead Pentagram. Quickly look again at the photocopy of the Devil's Pentagram, as copied from Goodman's Magic Symbol book. Protruding from the middle top of the Pentagram is a lighted candle, which is producing light. This physical light represents spiritual illumination. If this representation were made on a map, this illuminating candle would be thought of as being North. North is a very important direction, because it is the place of Governmental control. In I Ching, for example, North is the \"place one reports to the master on accomplishments\". (New Age Dictionary). This is again a fulfillment of Scripture. Lucifer Lucifer Lucifer Lucifer Remember in Isaiah 14:12-14, where God recalls Lucifer's original sin of pride and rebellion? Lucifer had every intention of taking God's throne by force and establishing his own reign. In verses 13 and 14, Lucifer vowed, \"I will ascend to Heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit upon the mount of assembly in the uttermost north ...\" Did you see that North is apparently the direction in which God's throne is situated, and Lucifer planned to take it over. North is the place, occultists believe, where Governmental authority dwells. Now look at the Goathead Pentagram again. Scott Circle is precisely located at the middle of the Goathead, and 16th Street proceeds directly north. As you look directly north on 16th Street, you will immediately see the House Of The Temple, which is the North American Headquarters of Freemasonry. Even the number 16 is significant to the occultist; it is 4x4 (Remember that the four upper points of the Goathead Pentagram represent the Four Elements of which the earth is constructed). Number 16 literally means \"felicity\", which, according to my Webster's Dictionary, means blissful happiness or anything which will produce such a state. Certainly, blissful happiness is the stated goal of any Satanic system. A corollary meaning of 16 is love. The number 16 also pops up in an encoded manner. Both Dupont Circle and Logan Circle, which form the top two most important points of the Goathead Pentagram, are located on \"P\" Street. \"P\" is the 16th letter of the English alphabet. Sixteenth Street emanates north from Scott Circle, which is itself the precise middle of the Goathead Pentagram. This street represents the candle of the photocopy. The illuminating light of the candle is represented by the House Of The Temple, which begins on \"R\" Street. The architect is literally saying that Freemasonry is the spiritual light of this Goathead Pentagram; of course, this Goathead Pentagram is rooted at the White House. One quick word on \"R\" Street. The letter \"R\" is the 18th letter of the English alphabet, and 18 is critically important to the occultist because it is 6+6+6 . The House Of The Temple is also located 13 city blocks north of the White House. Count them yourself, beginning with the first city block north of Lafayette Square. Of course, the number 13 represents rebellion against God's authority, and is generally thought of as Satan's number. It is no accident the House Of The Temple is located 13 blocks north of the White House. The meaning occulticly transmitted is that the control of the White House would be spiritual and would emanate from the House Of The Temple. Certainly, many American Presidents have been Freemasons. The most famous is George Washington, but the most influential was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who did more to advance the cause of the New World Order than anyone else in American history. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Seventeenth President Andrew Johnson 1865-1869 Brig General Albert Pike (1809-1891) Confederate The critical importance of this symbolism pointed out above, namely, that the Presidency of the United States is to be controlled by Freemasonry, is thoroughly documented by Christian author, Ralph Epperson, in his book, \"The New World Order\". On page 171, Epperson quotes testimony given in March, 1867, before the House Judiciary Committee, by General Gordon Granger. General Granger related a meeting between himself, President Andrew Johnson, who was a Mason, and Albert Pike, the most famous of all Masons. General Granger reported his surprise that President Johnson considered himself to be subordinate to Albert Pike. This subordination is detailed in the oath the initiate takes during the Third Degree, called the Master Mason's degree, inside the Blue Lodge. This oath states, \"I do promise...that I w ill obey all ...summonses..given..to me from the hand of a Brother Master Mason ...\" Presidents who are Masons are obligated to take orders from their Master Masons. But why should we be surprised? This is the meaning of the symbolization contained by the House Of The Temple being precisely 13 city blocks north of the White House. The Pentagon Now, let us quickly examine the importance of the square to the occultist. We need to understand this because the Eastern point of this Goathead Pentagram is a square, not a circle. The square is comprised of two (2) vertical lines and two (2) horizontal. According to Goodman in his book,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Magical Symbols,\" the vertical line symbolizes spirit. This spiritual force may move either from Heaven to Earth or from Earth to Heaven, or even from Heaven to Hell. The horizontal line symbolizes matter and movement from west to east. It also describes movement in time, as a direction in which one is traveling. This point is very critical, because the Freemason is committed to taking America in the direction of the New World Order. Since the square combines the vertical and the horizontal, it becomes a symbol of the material, physical realm which is enmeshed with spirit and time. The passage of time within an occultic spiritual context is what is in view here. In this instance, the United States of America is the physical realm which is moving in time toward the desired direction of the New World Order. Mason Headquarters (Mt. Vernon Square) This square also contains one more piece of occultic meaning. In this Goathead Pentagram, Mt. Vernon Square is the Eastern point. In occultic doctrine, East is the direction from which a person receives spiritual knowledge and guidance. This belief originated in the Pagan worship of the Sun, and it is very much alive in Freemasonry today. Now, let us look at the symbol contained in the lower right hand portion of your Washington , D.C., city street map. This combination of symbols runs South and East from the White House to the United States Capitol. These are the symbols which clearly stamp Freemasonry upon this city, and which unmistakably reveal that the brand of Luciferic worship which we see in the Goathead Pentagram is the brand practiced by Freemasonry. Let us look at these Freemasonry symbols. The three most sacred symbols of Freemasonry are the Compass, the Square, and the Rule or straight-edge. Look at the United States capitol, and you will see that it is laid out in the form of a circle. This represents the top of a professional compass of that era, which was circular. Pennsylvania Avenue, running from the Capitol to the White House, represents one leg of the compass. Maryland Avenue, running from the Capitol to Thomas Jefferson Memorial (left), represents the second leg of the compass. In this instance, you will have to lay out a ruler and draw a solid line from the Capitol to the Jefferson Memorial to get the full effect, because Maryland does not run straight through. It runs for a while and then disappears only to reappear again further toward the Memorial. However, you can easily see that the general direction runs precisely toward the Jefferson Memorial. This is the compass of Freemasonry. The Freemason's Square begins at Union Square, with Louisiana Avenue forming one arm and Washington Avenue the other. Again, you will have to draw a line down Louisiana Avenue and Washington to see the fully-formed square, because Louisiana ends at Pennsylvania and Washington ends at Maryland. The critical 90 0 angle of the square is pictorially missing; however, once you draw the natural continuation of Louisiana and Washington beyond their termination points you will see the 90 degrees square perfectly formed. The Freemason's Rule, or straightedge, is clearly seen if you draw a straight line south from the White House center to the base of the Washington Monument and then straight East to the Capitol. Thus, all three of the sacred instruments of Freemasonry are depicted in the layout of these streets. As I stated earlier, the deliberate planning of these Governmental Buildings so that they would be laid out so as to represent these three sacred tools of Freemasonry, coupled with the Luciferic Goathead Pentagram, clearly tell us that the brand of Luciferic control and worship planned for this capitol city was Freemasonry. This clearly shows that the New World Order for which FreeMasonry has labored for so many years is Luciferic, their vigorous protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" But there is more. Look again at the United States Capitol (above). At the extreme Eastern side of the Capitol, you can see two cul-de-sacs which are irregularly shaped. In fact, when you draw a bold black line carefully around these cul-de-sacs, and continue the black line around the Capitol, you get the appearance of a horned owl, with the cul-de-sacs as its ears. This is not accidental, either. This is another way of representing Satan. Freemasonry designed the layout of Washington D.C. they placed the owl there and on the American One Dollar Bill . The Southern point of the Goathead Pentagram represented the spirit of Satan reaching into the mind of the goathead, the owl represents the same meaning. In other words, both the Executive and the Legislative Branches of Government are to be controlled by Satan (II Corinthians 4). In commemoration of the 190th anniversary of the birth of George Washington, 48 American flags representing the then 48 states of the Union, encircling the monument, were raised on February 22, 1922. The current configuration of the more durable aluminum flagpoles date to 1959, following the inclusion of Alaska and Hawaii into the Union as the 49th and 50th states. Let us now quickly look at the Washington Monument, which lies directly West of the Capitol. In fact, the Washington Monument lies on a straight line, precisely 90 0 West of the Capitol. The Washington Monument(left) is the most important Presidential monument to the occultist, because it is an obelisk set inside a circle. What, you are probably saying, is an obelisk? An obelisk is a tall, four-sided stone pillar tapering toward a pyramidal top. The obelisk is critically important to the occultist because they believe that the spirit of the ancient Egyptian sun god, Ra, resided in the obelisk. Thus, the obelisk represents the very presence of the sun god, whom the Bible calls Satan!! There are only three major obelisks in the world today, and two of them are in the United States. According to Epperson in his book, \"The New World Order\", the first major obelisk was constructed in St. Peter's square in Rome, and is so placed that every Pope who addresses any crowd in the square, must face the obelisk. A New Age author, Peter Tomkins, reports the same facts in his book, \"The Magic Of Obelisks\", Harper and Row, New York, 1982, ISBN 0-06-014899-3. There is an obelisk in St. Peter's Bascilica as well. You'll be shocked to know that the Church of God promotes Celibacy while displaying a sex act right outside of St Peter's Bascilica. The second obelisk was brought to America in 1881 from Alexandria, Egypt, and was placed in Central Park in New York City. The third obelisk is the Washington Monument, built to commemorate our First President, George Washington (who was a Freemason). In light of the symbols which we have just studied, which have been built into the layout of Government Center, I believe the Washington Monument was constructed by Masons, according to Masonic tradition, as a symbol that this country was controlled by Freemasonry from the very beginning. And the Washington Monument has Freemasonry stamped all over it: * It is built from 36,000 separate blocks of granite. The number 36 is derived from multiplying 3x12 and is an important number. * Its capstone weighs exactly 3,300 pounds. * The monument contains 188 specially donated Memorial stones, most of them donated by individuals, societies, cities, and nations throughout the world. But, Masonic lodges throughout the world contributed 35 of these Memorial stones. These 35 blocks were intermingled with the other Memorial stones, but the last several of them were placed at the 330 foot level. * The total cost of the Washington Monument was reported to be $1,300,000, showing again a most important Masonic number, 13. * The Monument has 8 windows, and together they total 39 square feet in size. The number 39 is very sacred because it is formed by multiplying 3x13 AND 39 divided by two is 19.5 which is"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"another significant masonic number. And, also remember the importance of the Number 8 in Occultic Numerology, for it carries the meaning of \"New Beginnings\". Combined with the meaning of Number 13, as \"Extreme Rebellion\", you get the total message that this \"New Beginning\" {New World Order} is to be carried out in \"Extreme Rebellion.\" I believe this to also be connected to the UPC/EAN 13 BarCode specification (Mark of the Beast). There are several other, more complicated Masonic numbers concealed within the construction of the Washington Monument, but you get the point: This monument, constructed to honor the first Masonic President, was designed so that both the White House and the Capitol face toward it so that the leaders of both branches have to face the spirit of Lucifer thought to be residing in it. This is typical occultism. One final interesting note. We reported earlier in this article that the Washington Monument obelisk was placed directly on a straight line, precisely 90 0 West of the Capitol. Thus, the inhabitants of the Capitol could face the obelisk daily. However, note that the Washington, D.C., obelisk does not lie in a straight line 90 0 South the White House. Why? Because it was lined so that it lies in a straight line 90 0 from the House of Understanding, the headquarters of FreeMasonry!! In the mind of the occultist, the true political Administrative power resides in this Freemasonry headquarters, not in the White House. This is why President Andrew Johnson considered himself to be the subordinate to Albert Pike, the leader of North American FreeMasonry! Clearly, the power of leadership to drive this country toward the New World Order, leading the rest of the world, lies in FreeMasonry, not in the White House or the Congress. These symbols, built into the physical layout of Government Center in Washington, D.C., represent the extent of that power. Think of the many years these symbols have remained hidden from most people's knowledge; think of the millions of tourists which have walked on these streets during this time, without having any idea as to the existence of these symbols, not to mention their meaning! And, if you have ever driven a car in Washington D.C. area, you will now understand why these streets seem to be laid out so weird! Driving in Washington D.C. can be a nightmare. Now you know why. I will challenge any one to try and disprove this information. The odds against this happening accidentally are so astronomical and ridiculous! Do you see irrefutable evidences of a conspiracy here? And, now the end is apparently in sight. The Third World War, envisioned by Albert Pike in 1870 between Israel and her Arab neighbors, is apparently at hand. Out of this war is to come Antichrist. Are you spiritually ready? Is your family? Are you adequately protecting your loved ones? From the rest of my website, you should make the connection that the Churches and Governments are all controlled by this Brotherhood as well. Statue of Liberty Statue of Liberty Statue of Liberty Statue of Liberty - -- - information compiled by a list member information compiled by a list member information compiled by a list member information compiled by a list member The Statue of Liberty is another brotherhood symbol highlighting the lighted torch, Statue of Liberty is actually the Statue of Liberties - the liberties perpetrated on the American people by the brotherhood. It was given by French freemasons, a mirror image stands on an island in the river seine in Paris. Initiates into the rites of Mithra were called lions and were marked on their foreheads with the Egyptian cross. The first degree initiates had a golden crown placed on their heads, representing their spiritual self, and this crown, symbolizing the rays of the sun, can be found on the Statue of Liberty in NY harbor. All these rituals went back thousands of years to Babylon and the stories of Nimrod, Queen Semiramis, and Tammuz, their version of Jesus Mathra was said to be the son (Sun ) of god who died to save humanity and give them eternal life. One classic symbol of Mithra was a lion with a snake curled around his body, while he holds the keys to heaven. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Better Business Bureau, Notice the Torch?

The American flag is a symbol of the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood is linked to Satanism. The Flag has 50 pentagrams on it with thirteen stripes.

It is called \"Freemasonry.\" Freemasonry is linked to Satanism, however, not all Masons are evil or have evil intentions . In fact, a majority of them are mislead and kept in the dark as to what the true agenda is. Superior Masons deliberately lie to their fellow Masons, as those Masons \"deserve to be mislead.\" Explanations given to 95% of all Masons are wrong. Listen to this quote from a Masonic author, Carl Claudy : \" Cut through the outer shell and find a meaning; cut through that meaning and find another; under it, if you dig deep enough, you may find a third, a fourth -- who shall say how many teachings? \" So we see that Freemasonry deliberately misleads its members. This behavior of course, is not limited to just members of FreeMasonry, it extends to the entire human race. Freemasonry is a worship of Lucifer by the top 5% of all Masons. You can spot evidences of Satanism all over the world. There are numerous Masonic/Satanic symbols on this web site, all of which originate from this secret society called, \" The Brotherhood of the Serpent/Snake. \" Many call it \" Big Brother \" without even realizing its extraterrestrial origins. It was also known in ancient Egypt as \" The Mystery Schools .\" Freemasonry is the secret organization famous for its use of Christianity as a tool for control. The King James version of the Bible, edited by Sir Francis Bacon (a 33rd degree Freemason), is used to create ORDER in society through the implementation of a Belief system geared towards their Fascist Ideologies. The CHAOS is carefully orchestrated to insure the passing of more and more LAWS that will (eventually) completely destroy freedom. This is why there is more and more MORALITY being preached by the Politicians. This (as well as the WAR ON DRUGS) is the Product of the Secret Societies (Freemasons Etc..) who have a great motto \"Ordo Ab Chao\" meaning Order Out of Chaos. Agendas are formulated designed to give the powerful more power. Chaos is created, and media blitzed. Then cries go out for solution. Laws are passed which could never have been passed without the chaos. The Order has reigned by deception of the masses, and the Agenda is Accomplished. After all, it IS those secret societies (which follow this Egyptian model) that control the finances, Governments, and Religious systems that currently plague the planet with perversions of truth and Fascist agendas not becoming of the truly enlightened. Below are quotes written by high level Masons praising Lucifer with references: \"The Mysteries Of Magic' by Eliphas Levi \"What is more absurd and more impious than to attribute the name of Lucifer to the devil, that is, to personified evil.

Albert Pike 33° \" That which we must say to a crowd is - We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees - The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian Doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay whose deeds prove his cruelty, perf id y and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science, would Adonay and his priests, calumniate him? Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods: darkness being necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive. Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil. \" Instructions to the 23 Supreme Councils of the World, July 14, 1889.

If you really want to learn more, nevermind the red pill and eat the red apple and you will learn just how deep the rabbit hole goes. All of these Masons praise Lucifer. It is also the BIGGEST reason why we see Luciferic designs incorporated into Government center Washington D.C. Freemasonry is Satan's religion. It is the root of their control system. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" More on the Great Seal More on the Great Seal More on the Great Seal More on the Great Seal  Many companies use the pyramid within their logos. James Walker, a 32º Mason, shares some facts with us about the above symbols: • 13 leaves in the olive branch • 13 bars and stripes in the shield • 13 arrows in the right claw • 13 letters in the \"E Pluribus Unum\" on the ribbon • 13 stars in the green crest above • 32 long feathers on its right wing representing the 32º in Freemasonry • 13 granite stones in the Pyramid. (The 13 layers represent the 13 Illuminati bloodlines) • 13 letters in Annuit Coeptis It should also be noted that the Eagle has 32 feathers right wing, but 33 in its left wing. The 32 feathers representing the number of ordinary degrees of the Scottish Rite, and the 33 feathers representing the 33º of Freemasonry. The tail feathers number 9, the number of degrees in the York Rite. The eagle itself is a prominent icon of Masonry, being used extensively in the Scottish Rite. Looking just above the eagles head you will see 13 pentagrams within a cloud. The pentagrams are arranged in the shape of a hexagram - or greater Seal of Solomon. The hexagram is a powerful tool used by pagans to invoke Satan. It is also the sign of Anti Christ with 6 points, 6 angles and 6 planes ( 666 ). To the sorcerer, the hexagram is a powerful tool to invoke Satan, and is a sign of Antichrist. (6 points, 6 angles, 6 planes - 666 ) The 5 pointed pentagrams multiplied by the 13 stars equals 65, the same cabalistic number as mentioned above. This makes one wonder with whom or what , we are to dwell in unity! The eagle replaced the Phoenix in 1841 as the national bird. The Phoenix has been a Brotherhood symbol since ancient Egypt. The Phoenix was adopted by the Founding Fathers (Freemasons) for use on the reverse of the first official seal of the United States after a design proposed by Charles Thompson, Secretary of the Continental Congress.

There are also 39 green dots which surround the square, key and scale. Remember 39 ? Thirty nine divided by two is 19.5 . The number 19.5 can be seen within the design of Cydonia, Mars, Avebury, England and Washington D.C .

And all those numbers when added up equal 1776, the year the Illuminati formed. More than one method exists for arriving at 1776. However, there is only one way to arrive at the following sequence. The Babelonian numbering system was used by the Masonic designers of the Seal. That numbering system was not based on ten, but on six. For example, \"600\" would be 1000, \"60\" would be 100 and \"6\" would be 10. The Occult is Trinitarian, i.e. it's main teachings are grouped in three's. The Number Sequence \"93 and 93, 93\"; or 600, 60, and 6 is the \"current\" of the new age of Aquarius - the Water Bearer, which heralds the end of the age of Pisces - the Fishes (an early symbol of Christianity) in the teachings of the Order of the Eastern Templars or O.T.O.
