There is a vibrational transformation, a quickening,in the unseen realms beyond human sight that is teasing open the closed andconcrete minds of the human population.It is awakening those who are ready to emerge from the trance that holds them inservitude to the Hidden Hand that manipulates from the shadows through those whoonly appear to be ‘in power’. The goal of the Shadow People is an Orwellianglobal state of total control and compliance to their draconian dictatorship; aplace where freedom is lost in all its forms to the microchipped surveillance ofevery action, word and even thought. I have been warning about this for so longand faced much ridicule for my trouble, but laughter is a rare reaction thesedays as the evidence speaks in the language of daily experience.The vibrational quickening, and the ever-gathering extremes of governmentcontrol and imposition, have combined to open the eyes of an enormous number ofpeople to the reality that ‘something’s not right’. But what is it? In the firstof the Matrix movie trilogy, the Morpheus character says to the bewilderedseeker, Neo:> What you know you can’t explain, but you feel it. You’ve felt it your entire> life, that there’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is,> but it’s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. I know exactly how that feels and so do you, or you would not be reading thiswith the intent to answer the questions that are ‘driving you mad’ – Who am I?Where am I? Why is the world as it is?It was in the 1980s that I began my conscious journey in search of answers. Ithas taken me to more than forty countries and led me to knowledge, ‘ancient’ and‘modern’, which has shown me how many of the puzzle pieces fit. Only when thedots are connected can the picture be seen, and in this book I have pulledtogether two decades of research and experience to explain why ‘something’s notright’. As always, it is a work in progress, but it makes a giant leap along theroad to understanding the human condition and how we can change it. The writerMichael Ellner rightly said:> Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors> destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge,> governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions> destroy spirituality. This is not by accident, but by design … as I will now explain as the dots areconnected."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 1 So who are we? > The true value of a human being can be found in the degree to which he has> attained liberation from the self. > Albert Einstein Humour me a little while I state the obvious … we get lost because we don’t knowwhere we are. Of course, simple. We get lost because we don’t have theinformation to tell us where we are and, without that, we can’t find the wayhome. Equally obvious. How can we get somewhere if we don’t know where we are tostart with?All this may be a no-brainer, but what is in your face is not always in yourmind. As the saying goes: If you want to hide something, put it on publicdisplay. What I have just described is precisely the plight of the ‘human race’.We are lost because (a) we don’t know where we are and (b) we don’t have accessto the necessary information to tell us where we are. In fact, in our case, itgoes even further. We don’t even know who we are, let alone where. As JohnLennon wrote: ‘How can I go forward when I don’t know which way I’m facing? Howcan I go forward when I don’t know which way to turn?’ Without those coordinates– who we are and where we are – how can we possibly make sense of what we seeand experience? We can’t. So we guess (often wildly) and these guesses arecalled religions and scientific theories. We talk about making ‘educatedguesses’ based on the best information available, but what if that information –expressed through religion and science – was fundamentally flawed and, even moresignificantly, was meant to be so? We would be faced with a situation even moreconfusing than simply not knowing which direction to head. We would be sent offin the wrong direction believing that the passer-by with the mitre or themicroscope knew what they were talking about.Today, there is a growing understanding that our maps are out of date and wehave been reading them the wrong way up. Or, rather, we’ve had this done for usby agents, often unknowingly so, of a system that can only exist by keeping usin ignorance of the compass and coordinates that will lead us home. Someone’sbeen messing with road signs to confuse and control, and this book is designedto be a guide to who we are, where we are and how the few are manipulating ourdaily lives on a scale, and to an end, that beggars belief. From this,everything else will come, and what has appeared until now to be a crazy,bewildering, inexplicable ‘world’ will suddenly morph into focus. The worldseems crazy because we have been looking from the wrong angle. Look at itanother way and … ‘WOW, so that’s what’s going on!’Firstly, key coordinate number one: Who are we?Ask most people who they are and they would say something like: ‘I am JoeBloggs. I’m an office worker from Tooting in London, and I am married with threechildren. I like football and gardening and I would like to visit my brother inAustralia’. You hear that sort of thing all the time when people appear on TVgame-shows and are invited to ‘Tell us about yourself’. People identify who theyare with their job, income, their likes and dislikes, and what we would calltheir ‘personality’ – ‘I love to have a laugh and party’; ‘I like to stay athome and live a quiet life’, or whatever. But another ‘What if?’ What if whatyou call ‘you’, your ‘personality’, even your sex, is not you at all? What ifthese are all expressions of a computer program that you have been kidded isyou? We’d think it was insane if an astronaut was asked who he was and he beganto detail the features of his spacesuit: ‘I am a NASA Mark III, born in the1990s. I have a hard upper torso, brief and hip transition elements, and rollingconvolute shoulder, waist and hip abduction/adduction joints. I am capable ofbeing pressurised at 0.56 atmospheres, and would like to visit my brother at theInternational Space Station’. We would likely think that the guy had alreadybeen pressurised too much. What is he doing identifying himself with hisspacesuit, the silly sod? He needs help, big time, quick. Yes, he does, butthen, he’s not alone, is he? ‘Human beings’ do exactly the same. We believe weare our spacesuit, and once we fall for that one we have lost the entire plot.How could a spaceman operate if he thought he was his spacesuit? There would bechaos and confusion on a gigantic scale, right? Well, look around at this‘world’ of spacesuit believers and what do you see? Chaos and confusion on agigantic scale. How could it be any other way?So the first revelation on the road to freedom: your body is not ‘you’ – it is afantastic biological computer that ‘you’ are using to experience this reality.It is a vehicle, a means, not a ‘you’ or an ‘I’. The spacesuit is the means bywhich an astronaut can experience other ‘worlds’. So is your ‘body’. We are notour bodies, we are Infinite Consciousness, the All That Is, a seamless energyfield within which all ‘worlds’ and no ‘worlds’ exist. The only differencebetween everything is the level of awareness that we are All That Is. The deeperthis awareness, the more you will access that level of ‘knowing’ and perception;the more you think you are an ‘individual’ and apart from everything else, themore you will disconnect from the Infinite One that you really are. We live in arealm of division and ‘apartness’ because we have forgotten, and beenmanipulated to forget, our true and infinite nature. Albert Einstein describedreality as ‘an illusion, albeit a persistent one’, and he said:> A human being is a part of the whole, called by us Universe, a part limited in> time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something> separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This> delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires> and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free> ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all> living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Even more than that, to embrace that we are Infinite Consciousness, or what Iwill call Infinite Awareness. This is a level of consciousness that knows it iseverything. It is the self-aware ALL. Think of the difference between a dropletof water and the ocean; the droplet symbolises the sense of division, of beingan individual ‘me’, unconnected to anything else. This is like identifying withbeing ‘Bill Bloggs’ or ‘Ethel Jones’. But, put that droplet back in the ocean,and where does the ocean end and the droplet begin? There is no beginning and noend, no Alpha and Omega, because all is One. At that level there is no ‘we’ –only an Infinite ‘I’. Part of that ocean may be calm and peaceful and anothermay be angry and rough, but it is still the same ocean, the same Oneness. We arealways the ocean, always Infinite Awareness, and we cannot literally becomedisconnected from that. However, when we forget who we are, we can be confusedinto a sense of division, of being the droplet, and we perceive reality throughthe tiny lens that this creates in our minds. This lens perceives what itbelieves and brings into manifestation an experience that matches the belief.Think small and you’ll be small, even though you are Infinite Possibility. Thisis the plight of what we call humanity. We are the ocean, Infinite Awareness,but we believe we are just a little powerless, insignificant droplet. Weidentify with division and ‘parts’, not unity. This has happened because of themassive manipulation of our sense of reality that has led us to identify the ‘I’with the biological computer we call the body. Look at how many religions claimit is blasphemous to say you are the All, or what they call ‘God’. We can’t saywe are ‘God’; we must be humble and accept that we are subordinate sinners whomust cower in the face of the Almighty – them. You are an insignificant piece ofshit, get used to it, and only if the men in frocks put in a good word have youany chance of avoiding the guy with the pitch fork. This nonsense is designed bythose who control the religions (not the programmed underlings in the funnyhats) to lock us into the computer level of perception, the level at which weare easy to shepherd and pen. Listen to the language of religion – ‘The Lord isyour shepherd and you are part of the flock’. I will refer to those imprisonedin the body-computer reality as ‘unconscious’, and those with an awareness ofthe greater whole as ‘conscious’. In fact, everything is conscious; only thelevel of awareness is different, but I will use the terms ‘conscious’ and‘unconscious’ to keep it as simple as possible. By this definition, almost theentire human population is unconscious, because people identify who they arewith their body-computers (Figure 1, overleaf). Fortunately, we are now in anera when this is beginning to change.Computer realityA biological computer is often described as a ‘living’ computer; ‘biological’ isdefined as ‘pertaining to life and living things’. It is a computer that canwork out solutions without being told exactly how to do it. These are now beingdeveloped around the world although, naturally, they are little more thancounting-beads compared with the biological computer that is the human body.Still, the principle is the same. Professor Bill Ditto is leading thebiological-computer research at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He says:‘Ordinary computers need absolutely correct information every time to come tothe right answer. We hope a biological computer will come to the correct answerbased on partial information, by filling in the gaps itself’. Put most simply,biological computers have the ability, up to a point, to think for themselves.This is true of the body, on a far more advanced scale, and the problem is thatwe are allowing it to think for us, too. We have become entrapped by theillusion that our body is who we are and therefore we believe that all thethoughts and emotions of the body-computer are ours. Not necessarily so. Infact, if we are talking about higher levels of our Infinite Awareness, never so.I would update the Albert Einstein quote at the top of this chapter and say:‘The true value of a human being can be found in the degree to which he hasattained liberation from the computer-self’. The various parts of a computermirror the workings of the body because in theme they are the same. Thebody-computer system is based upon the DNA/genetic network and other bodysystems and energetic fields that communicate information between the cells,among many other things, in response to thought, emotion and environmentalinfluences. When the communication is working well we are ‘healthy’, because theright information is reaching the right cells at the right time. It is thiscommunication network that responds to disease, or heals cuts and bruises, andreleases chemicals or absorbs toxins as necessary to maintain balance and reactto challenge and change. When this system breaks down, the instructions becomescrambled, like a mobile phone breaking up, and the body malfunctions. We callthis ‘illness’, be it physical, mental or emotional. Look at what happens whenthe instructions passing around a desktop computer become muddled because of a‘virus’, or whatever. The computer starts to show signs of ‘dis-ease’ ordisharmony. At first, only its speed of reaction may be affected and we say ‘thecomputer is slow’. It is slow because the information is not being communicatedthrough the circuitry at optimum speed and efficiency. The ‘virus’ can go on todistort communications to the extent that the computer won’t even turn onanymore. What do we say at that point? ‘My computer is dead’. This is whathappens when ‘we’ die.Image [../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 1: Humans on the merry-go-round. Most people are operating at thecomputer level of reality; others are more conscious, but still trapped in theillusion; and some are consciously connected to Infinite Awareness In truth, ‘we’ don’t die because ‘we’ can’t. We are Infinite Awareness – not abody. It is our computer that dies when either its communication system hasbroken down and is no longer able to function, or consciousness chooses towithdraw from this reality and end the experience. Consciousness provides thepower source to animate the computer, to ‘plug it in the mains’, if you like,and so when it goes the plug is pulled. What happens when you drop a computerfrom a great height? It doesn’t work anymore – it dies. What happens when aperson is dropped from a great height? The same. What happens when a computervirus destroys the operating system of a computer? It doesn’t work anymore – itdies. What happens when a virus, cancer or other malfunction destroys theoperating system of the body? The same. What happens when the memory of acomputer fails? It becomes confused and unable to respond to instructions andinformation as it could before. What happens when this happens in a ‘humanbeing’? We call it Alzheimer’s, or mental illness. A computer goes into ‘sleepmode’ when it is inactive and resting. So does the body. The analogies go on andon – as they must when we are talking about the same basic phenomena andoperating principles.The point to emphasise again, however, is that we don’t die and we don’t getAlzheimer’s or mental illness – the body-computer does. In the same way, acomputer operator at the keyboard does not get the computer virus. What we referto as ‘mental handicap’ is not a problem with our Infinite Awareness; it is adamaged computer. You can be the best computer operator on the planet, but ifyour machine can’t process your input you cannot make it work to full potential.We say we can’t make a computer do what it could do before, especially as itgets old and worn out. What do we say about our bodies as they age? ‘I can’t dowhat I used to do.’ Note that we use the term ‘I’ for the body when we say suchthings. The body-computer is not who we are. We are consciousness – awareness –all that has always been, is, and ever shall be. We are Infinite Awareness, nota finite computer, and once we confuse the two our SatNav can think a prison isan open road. Our world is structured to make us confuse the two because then weare controllable and suppressible, as this book will show. A computer isprogrammed to respond to a set of instructions, or ‘software’. It has a circuitboard, or ‘motherboard’, to communicate electrical signals to its various parts,and the key processor of information through the network is called amicroprocessor, or CPU – the central processing unit. A computer has a memorycalled the ‘hard drive’ and a ‘virtual memory’ or ‘RAM’ that holds informationwhile the computer is in use. What you want to keep within this virtual memoryis then transferred to the hard drive when you press ‘save’. Computers also havesoftware to protect them from being destabilised by viruses and other externalattacks. These are called firewalls and anti-virus programs like NortonAnti-Virus. The body-computer operates in basically the same way. It has a harddrive, virtual memory, circuit board and anti-virus ‘software’.Genetic hard driveThe body’s hard drive is comprised of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, and cells.As we shall see, the cells are like computer chips. The two spiralling strandsof DNA in the cells are recognised to be the body’s genetic library that carry,and ‘download’ through procreation, the codes of our physical characteristics(Figure 2). But that is only part of the role of DNA. We have some 120 billionmiles of the stuff, and it can store more than a hundred trillion times moreinformation than any device that human science can construct. The principles arethe same between the body and a desktop computer, but they are light years apartwhen it comes to scale, potential and sophistication. Another point to emphasiseabout DNA is how little established science knows about it; some 95 to 97 percent of DNA is referred to as ‘junk DNA’ because scientists have no idea what itdoes. Think about that. We each have 120 billion miles of DNA and yet up to (andprobably more than) 97 per cent is a mystery to scientists who then have thenerve to tell us how we should, and should not, treat our bodies – the bodiesthey are thoroughly ignorant about. We should remember that scientists andintellectuals don’t have to be conscious in terms of Infinite Awareness, and thetrouble is that the overwhelming majority of them are not. Their intellectmostly comes from the computer level of thought. How often is it that thegreatest breakthroughs have come not through the intellect, primarily, butthrough intuitive hunch? The hunch is then followed up by the intellect andfound to be valid. Our hunches, our intuition, inspiration or what I call‘knowing’, come from Infinite Awareness – not intellect. The ‘scientific’ and‘intellectual’ professions, like teachers, university lecturers, and those inthe media, are awash with unconscious people (along with some very frustratedconscious ones). This is why science has found itself at so many dead ends whenit comes to explaining reality. They are programmed thinkers rather thaninspired, All-Knowing Awareness, and as body-believers they come from theperspective of body reality – the five senses. A true scientific genius, NikolaTesla, who died in 1943, said: ‘The day science begins to study non-physicalphenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all previouscenturies of its existence’. To so many, if it can’t be seen, heard, touched,smelled or tasted it can’t exist, but everything is energy, most of it unseen.DNA and the body in general are also energy fields and one expression of this isthe ‘aura’. What we call the aura is like the electromagnetic field that holdsthe information on a computer disk or system. The auric fields (the ‘mind’) areconstantly communicating with the body’s ‘physical’ level and giving it ‘life’.So please remember that whenever I talk about DNA, genetics, cells, etc., I amincluding their energetic expression, the auric fields. Thought and emotion, forinstance, are communicated by the auric fields to the ‘physical’ level wherethey are expressed electrochemically. What I call ‘five sense consciousness’ or‘body consciousness’ is both the ‘physical’ body and the energetic body – thelower auric fields.Image [../Images/00007.jpg]Figure 2: DNA, the body-computer ‘hard drive’ The inference of the term ‘junk DNA’ is that it is surplus to requirements andhas no purpose – the very idea of which is mind-bogglingly ridiculous. One ofthe major roles of this so-called ‘junk DNA’, along with other body systems, isto connect with other realms of reality and to receive, communicate and amplifyinformation, much like a broadcast transmitter/receiver. The DNA’s shape andcrystalline structure make it perfect for this, as I’ll come to in the nextchapter. It is also vital to realise that DNA in all forms of life, from ahuman, to a mouse, to a flower, to a fish, to a virus, is basically the same.All DNA is comprised of the same four codes known as adenine, guanine, cytosineand thymine, or A, G, C and T. The only difference between a flower and a humanis the order in which these four codes are put together, and very smalldifferences in the coding can produce massive differences in physicalcharacteristics. The DNA distinction between a human body and a mouse ismarginal compared with the fundamental differences in physical form. If you haveseen the Matrix movie trilogy you will appreciate how the DNA code sequence inFigure 3 looks like the computer codes featured in those films. It is not onlythe human body that is a biological computer system; so, of course, are allforms of ‘life’ in this reality that we call the ‘world’. Everything you seethat has apparent physical form is a computer program, and A, G, C and T arelike computer codes.Image [../Images/00008.jpg]Figure 3: The A, G, C and T computer codes that decide ‘physical’ and othercharacteristics look like the computer screens in the Matrix movies Image [../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 4: The body’s circuit board, or ‘motherboard’, is clearly seen in thisimage produced at the Necker Hospital in Paris Meridian motherboardThe body’s circuit board is the meridian system that forms the basis of theancient healing art of acupuncture. Thousands of years ago, the Chinese knewabout the network of energy lines passing around and through the body that arenow called meridians. Along these lines are many points, known as acupuncturepoints, where the flow of energy through the meridians can be regulated by usinghair-like needles and other techniques. You can see in Figure 4 how the meridiansystem even looks like a circuit board. This is a computer-enhanced version ofan image produced at the Necker Hospital in Paris in a joint study with theCytology Laboratory at the Military Hospital. They injected a radioactive tracerinto acupuncture points and then took the photograph with a gamma camera to seewhere it would go. It followed the pattern of the acupuncture meridian system.Not only does this confirm the existence of the meridian network, which ‘modernmedicine’ has long dismissed and ridiculed, but the study also establishedanother crucial fact. It found that the slower the energy (or chi to theChinese) passed through the meridians, the less healthy was the person involved.When the energy was flowing at optimum speed and balance the subject was in goodhealth. How can this be? Because the energy, the chi, is information thatincludes details about a problem or imbalance, and the instructions on how torespond. If people were taking too long to tell you that a problem existed andtoo long to pass your response to those at the scene, what would happen? Theproblem would not get fixed and would probably worsen as a result. This is onereason why people who are ill are more vulnerable to other illnesses. The chialso carries instructions to maintain balance and harmony and, again, when thiscommunication is affected, so is the balance and harmony, and the body becomesdis-eased. As we have discussed, the first thing you notice when a computerbegins to malfunction is that it is slower than normal to respond to yourinstructions. Once that happens, it can go on to become far worse unless actionis taken to clear the system of whatever is slowing the communications traffic.So it is with the chi in the body circuit board. Those who have no understandingof how the body works, or even what it is, have long laughed at acupuncture andother ‘alternative’ methods of healing. Their ignorance cannot grasp how puttinga needle in the foot or leg could cure a headache, for instance. This is becausethey associate the pain with the location of the pain rather than seeing thebody as a whole. The meridians form circuits around the body, and a line thatpasses through the head also passes through the leg and foot. A blockage inthese areas can cause disharmony elsewhere on the circuit, and so restoring theflow at a corresponding point on the foot or leg can remove the pressure, orother problem that is causing the headache. Computer technicians do somethingsimilar when they ‘clean up’ a computer to make the electrical circuits flow atoptimum speed. These technicians are often referred to as ‘computer doctors’.How very apt.The meridian system also links with a series of vortices that connect the humancomputer to our Infinite Awareness, or they’re supposed to do anyway. There aremany such vortices and they are known as ‘chakras’, a word that comes from theancient Indian language of Sanskrit and means ‘wheels of light’. There are sevenmain vortices, the base, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, andcrown chakras (Figure 5), and they connect to the body-computer through theglands of the endocrine system. The heart chakra is the balance point in thecentre of the chest, and this is the real origin of feeling love ‘in the heart’.As the knowledge was lost, the symbol of love became the ‘physical’ heart. Thethird-eye chakra, in the centre of the forehead, is our connection to psychicsight and communication, and it interacts with the pineal gland in the centre ofthe brain. The pineal gland is light-sensitive and produces melatonin, thehormone that regulates sleep, and serotonin, a vitally important transmitter ofelectrical impulse in the brain. It is what is known as a ‘neurotransmitter’.René Descartes, the 17th century French philosopher and mathematician, concludedthat the pineal gland was the ‘seat of the soul’. But it’s really areceiver–transmitter that connects the ‘soul’ – Awareness – to the computer. Thecrown chakra, on the top of the head, is the master connection with InfiniteAwareness and its gland is the pituitary gland, the ‘master gland’, which isalso located in the brain and secretes the hormones that control the wholeendocrine system. Some say the pituitary is the gland of the third eye, and thepineal is the gland of the crown, but it doesn’t matter either way for thepurposes of this book. Both chakras connect us to ‘out there’, and if there is aproblem with either of these glands it makes that connection far more difficult.They work with the hypothalamus in the brain, which is a key regulator of ouremotional state and it organises and controls feelings and moods, as well ashunger, appetite and food intake, and everything to do with the concept ofpleasure and creative activity. The hypothalamus is vital to the balance ofbody, mind and emotions and, along with the endocrine glands, it is targeted bychemicals used in mass-market food and drink, and by electromagnetic means. Ionce had a vivid dream as I was beginning to wake up to the bigger picture inthe 1980s: I was reading a Bible and the only words I could see was the name‘John Pineal’. It was so vivid that I thought at first I had definitely read itin a Bible. I had never heard of the pineal gland at the time, but it is highlysignificant to connecting with the greater ‘I’, and I’ll pick up on this themelater. The chakra vortices, by the way, are part of what we know as the ‘aura’,the energy field that surrounds the body and can be measured electrically, andeven seen by some psychics. They see the aura as different colours that changewith changing emotional and mental states. Different thoughts and emotions aredifferent frequencies and vibrations, and every frequency represents a colour,or shade of colour.Image [../Images/00010.jpg]Figure 5: The chakra vortices that connect the body to other levels of reality What is the brain and where is memory?Okay, we have identified the foundation of the body-computer system: the DNA andcells, and its circuit board, the meridian network. Next, we have the centralprocessing unit, or CPU, which we call the brain. A CPU is actually known as‘the brain of the computer’ because, like the human brain, it reads, controlsand processes all communications traffic. Within the body-computer, the braindecides what to make of the information – what to do with it and where it shouldgo. We should remember it is the brain that receives the information from thefive senses and decides how to decode it. If you can manipulate and program thebrain to read these messages in a different way, you can get someone to eat anapple and yet taste banana. Skilled hypnotists do this sort of thing in theirstage shows. We don’t feel pain at the location of a blow; we feel it when theinformation about the blow has reached the brain to be decoded into ‘ouch!’. Allthis is key to answering the questions in the next chapter: ‘Where are we? And,what is reality?’I mentioned that computers have two forms of memory – the hard drive that holdsinformation long-term, and the ‘virtual memory’, or RAM, that allows you to usemany different applications at one time while you are working at the keyboard.Anything you want to retain permanently from your work in virtual-memory modecan be transferred to the hard drive via the ‘save’ button. The body has asimilar system known as short-term and long-term memory. One article I saw onthis subject said: ‘Short-term memory, sometimes referred to as “primary” or“active” memory, is that part of memory which stores a limited amount ofinformation for a limited amount of time … This can be contrasted to long-termmemory in which a seemingly unlimited amount of information is storedindefinitely’. Another explanation at www.psychtests.com[http://www.psychtests.com] put it this way:> Basically anything you see, hear, touch, or experience enters almost instantly> (in a quarter of a second) into your short-term memory. We have short-term> memories so we can use something immediately and then forget it if we no> longer need to know it. We use it to recognize or understand something right> at the moment that we’re faced with it. Everything, essentially, starts with> short-term memory … > … Your long-term memory is where you keep all the memories and facts that you> use to define who you are. Your first memory as a child, the first love letter> you ever wrote or received, the time you broke your arm – it’s all in there.> While we can’t explain for sure why we recall certain things and not others,> we do know some things about long-term memory. Information passes through> short-term to get to long term. In fact, there is another level of memory – the true ‘I’ (Infinite Awareness) –where everything is remembered. The above tallies very well with the way that weuse virtual memory to work at a computer and gather information, and then savewhat we want to keep on the hard drive.Software immunityThe body’s version of the firewalls and anti-virus programs that we have oncomputers is called the ‘immune system’. As with Norton Anti-Virus and all therest, the immune system is there to protect the body-computer from attacks onits operating system. The makers of Norton say:> One of the biggest slowdowns of a PC is caused by viruses, adware or spyware> as it’s often called … A virus is a piece of malicious software code written> to cause some kind of damage to a computer system, or network, or even the> Internet itself. Viruses spread, similar to their biological namesake, from> one machine to another and can spread havoc wherever they go. The system protecting computers from such invasion works like this:> It runs unobtrusively in the background, checking all vulnerable files for> possible infection by mischievous, sometimes malevolent, programs called> viruses and worms. [It] … does this by looking for the identifying signatures> of these worms and viruses and comparing them to known viruses for which it> has files. In its own way, the human immune system does the same; it seeks out ‘foreigninvaders’ – ‘identifying their signatures and comparing them to known viruses’and threats. It then attempts to destroy them, quarantine them in various ways,and maintain the harmony of the biological computer that is the body. If theimmune system is undermined or overwhelmed by the scale or number of attacks, itcan no longer protect the body from the consequences. It is the same withcomputer anti-virus software. If the immune system is faced with new forms ofviruses, or other attacks, it can also fail to deal with them – the same withanti-virus software. A famous example of this was when smallpox ravaged theNative American population after the Europeans arrived. The indigenous peoplehad never encountered smallpox before, and so neither had their immune systems.The Europeans had experienced smallpox and were much less prone to its effects.Their ‘Nortons’ had been ‘updated’, you might say. Wherever you look, thecomputer analogy is applicable to the workings of the body, and it is thesimilar principles and structure of both that makes it possible to developcomputers today that respond to human thought – the so-called ‘human-computerinterface’. In truth, it is a computer-computer interface. The difference isonly in scale and advancement and the fact that the body is a biologicalcomputer – it has the ability to think for itself to a significant extentwithout input from the keyboard operator … consciousness, awareness. Thisexplains so much about the ‘world’, as we shall see.The rat brain pilotResearch into developing biological computers is well underway, including astudy at the University of Florida which took 25,000 neural cells from a singlerat embryo and taught it to fly a plane! Well, an F-22 jet simulator, anyway. Itsounds fantastic, and on one level it is, but the logic is very straightforwardonce you realise what we are dealing with. The neural cells were suspended in aspecialised liquid to keep them alive and then laid across a grid of 60electrodes in a small glass dish. Under a microscope they looked like grains ofsand at first, but quickly connected to form what scientists call a ‘livecomputation device’. We’d call it a brain. The researchers attached electrodesto monitor and stimulate neural activity so that they could study how the brainprocesses and transfers information. The rat brain cells were then connectedthrough a desktop computer to the jet simulator and they were taught to fly theplane. They were eventually able to control the aircraft even in hurricane-forcewinds. One of the Florida team, Dr Thomas DeMarse, explained:> When we first hooked them up, the plane “crashed” all the time, but … the> neural network slowly adapts as the brain learns to control the pitch and roll> of the aircraft. After a while, it produces a nice straight and level> trajectory. The network receives the information about the aircraft’s pitch> and roll in the form of stimulation pulses, and its responses change over> time. We are its external teachers as it learns. Once it learns the technique, the ‘rat brain’ can do it without help, and thebiological nature of the cells mean they can also work things out forthemselves, to an extent. The team hopes that this research will help to develop‘sophisticated hybrid computers, with a thinking biological component’. One aimis to install ‘living computers’ in unmanned aircraft that can be deployed onmissions considered too dangerous for pilots. They could be used in remotebomb-clearance machines, it is suggested. A reality check here: Biologicalcomputers could also potentially be used to take control of humans – as with themachines in the Matrix trilogy. Once they can think without external input, suchoutcomes become seriously possible. Robots that can think for themselves are nowbeing developed and at the end of this trail will be the ability to create ahuman-like body-computer (in fact, in the most secret and advanced projects theyalready can). There is a research programme called Reverb (short for ‘ReverseEngineering the Vertebrate Brain’) and Henrik Christiansen, director of theCenter of Robotics and Intelligent Machines at the Georgia Institute ofTechnology, believes that we will have to consider human rights legislation for‘conscious’ robots over the next 50 years. Human rights for humans would be astart.The penny drops … for someIncreasingly, the technology we are using mirrors the human body-computer andthis includes digital computers that operate with the binary system of numbers.Experiments have shown that when the correct electrical current is used on thecell membrane its gates and channels open and when there is no current theyclose. This is an expression of the same binary system you find in computers. Ifound this explanation on the Internet:> A digital computer is designed to process data in numerical form; its circuits> perform directly the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction,> multiplication, and division. The numbers operated on by a digital computer> are expressed in the binary system; binary digits, or bits, are 0 and 1 ...> Binary digits are easily expressed in the computer circuitry by the presence> (1) or absence (0) of a current or voltage. Not surprisingly, a key part of the human brain also operates on the binarysystem, according to psychology professor Randall O’Reilly of the University ofColorado at Boulder. He says that a region of the brain that scientists believeis critical to human intellectual abilities functions much like a digitalcomputer. ‘Many researchers who create these models shun the computer metaphor’,O’Reilly said. ‘My work comes out of a tradition that says people’s brains arenothing like computers and now all of a sudden as we look at them, in fact, in acertain respect they are like computers.’ The brain, as with the body itself, isa highly sophisticated biological computer that is light years ahead of computerscience, and it is because of this sophistication that there will appear to bedifferences when we are not comparing like with like. But in theme and principlethey are the same. As we’ve seen, digital computers operate by turningelectrical signals into binary ‘on and off states’ and Professor O’Reilly foundthe same operating principles in the brain. ‘The neurons in the prefrontalcortex are binary – they have two states, either active or inactive – and thebasal ganglia is essentially a big switch that allows you to dynamically turn onand off different parts of the prefrontal cortex’, O’Reilly said. The prefrontalcortex was the ‘executive centre’ of the brain and supported ‘higher level’cognition, including decision making and problem solving. He said researchersbelieved that the prefrontal cortex is critical to human intellectual abilityand understanding more about human intelligence. I have thought for some timethat the transfer from analogue to digital television will allow greatermanipulation of the human brain because of the closer operational connectionbetween digital TV and the digital brain, and the more I understand the morecertain I am. If you are new to this information you will see why this is not sofar-fetched when I detail how this world is controlled, by whom and to what end.So part of the brain operates on the binary system, while much of it works onthe ‘trinary’ system of three numbers. Guosong Liu, a neuroscientist at thePicower Center for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, said in the publication Nature Neuroscience that understanding thiscould have major implications for the development of new computers. He says thebrain’s trinary code uses the numbers nought, one and minus one which has fargreater potential than the binary system and allows the brain to ignoreinformation when necessary – like ignoring your surroundings while you areconcentrating on something. ‘Computers don’t ignore information’, Liu said.‘This is an evolutionary advantage that’s unique to the brain.’ It is believedthat future computers and software will function on trinary systems and makeeverything we see today obsolete within the next ten years. I repeat, thebrain/body and computers operate on the same principle – it is just the level ofadvancement that is different. Like everything ‘physical’, DNA is also a digitalphenomenon on one level.Downloading ‘evolution’What I am saying here about the body-computer explains the great mystery of‘evolution’ when ‘physical’ forms change in response to changing environments.We see all the time in nature how species have adapted and readapted to theirenvironments. This happens in incredible detail and if it did not, the animal,bird or insect would not survive. The term ‘mutation’ is defined as ‘a change ofthe DNA sequence within a gene or chromosome of an organism resulting in thecreation of a new character or trait not found in the parental type’. Thesechanges are generated by the body-computer system which receives informationfrom its environment and constantly assesses the consequences for its comfortand survival. One example is the process of thermoregulation that maintains bodytemperature within certain levels even when it is faced with very differentexternal conditions of hot and cold. The body is constantly making large andsmall adjustments in response to inner and outer change and challenges,physical, mental and emotional. It is the same principle as the rat brain cellsmaking decisions in the face of information received to make the jet simulatorcope with changing weather conditions. These adjustments by the body-computerlead eventually to permanent changes if there are permanent modifications to itsenvironment. This is what we call ‘evolution’. It is the evolution of thebody-computer, not Infinite Awareness. Survival is the major program runningthrough the system and this is why we have such a survival instinct. This‘instinctive response’ is generated from the computer program and the more wefocus on survival for its own sake, the more we will sync with the computerlevel of reality. Infinite Awareness doesn’t need to survive because it cannot‘die’. The examples of the computer reacting to survive are endless and includethe ‘fight or flight’ response where we either run or become violent when facedwith potential danger. As I was writing this chapter, I came across a news storyabout insects that were no longer being killed by pesticides that once wipedthem out. This is another expression of the body-computer responding to dangerin order to survive. Sometimes, the environmental changes are so fast and sogreat that the computer’s ‘living mind’ cannot make the fundamental adjustmentsquickly enough and it leads to a species becoming ‘extinct’.Welcome to the ‘Earth Channel’So ‘we’ are Infinite Awareness and not our bodies. We use the biologicalcomputer to experience this ‘world’ or reality, that’s all. If we didn’t, wecould not interact with our environment. What we call ‘Creation’ is made up of avast web of interconnecting frequencies, or ‘dimensions’, of life andexperience. The analogy of television and radio broadcasts is very appropriate.In the space that you are occupying now are all the radio and televisionfrequencies broadcasting to your area. You can’t see them and they are not awareof each other because you and they are on different frequencies, or wavelengths.Only when the frequencies are really close do they experience ‘interference’. Itis the same with our reality. Our ‘physical world’ is just one of countlesswavelengths, frequencies or dimensions, and to experience and interact with thisrealm we need an outer shell that is vibrating within this frequency range. Ourconsciousness is vibrating too fast to interact efficiently with this frequency.Think of it this way: could you pick up a cup if you were vibrating to thefrequency broadcasts of BBC radio or CBS television? No. Such frequencies wouldpass through the cup and it would not move, just as radio and televisionbroadcasts pass through walls without any effect on the wall. This is where thebody-computer comes in; it is vibrating to this ‘physical world’ frequency rangeand thus can interact with everything else on the same wavelength – be it a cup,comb or car key. The body is the means through which our Infinite Awareness candirectly experience this range of frequencies that I will call, to keep itsimple, the five-sense realm, world or dimension. This is why the five senses ofsight, touch, smell, hearing and taste are so limited. They are confined toperceiving only this range of frequencies – this dimension. For instance, thefrequency range of human sight is bordering on the infinitesimal compared withwhat exists in the space we think we can see. Our eyes can perceive onlyso-called ‘luminous matter’ – that which reflects light within a certainfrequency range. Even within what we experience as the physical world we canonly see objects when there is light reflecting from them. In a pitch-black roomwith no light source we see nothing. This principle applies on the bigger scale,too. Scientists currently suggest that at least 95 per cent of the mass in theuniverse is ‘dark matter/energy’ that we cannot see because it is not reflectinglight in a way that human sight can perceive. The electromagnetic spectrum isjust 0.005 per cent of the matter/mass said to exist in this universe, yet humansight can see only a fraction even of that 0.005 per cent (Figures 6 and 7).This fraction is known as ‘visible light’ and if we saw any less we would beblind. What we think is an infinite universe is really a tiny, tiny frequencyrange that our five senses can access. Those senses are part of the bodycomputer-program that tunes our awareness into this ‘television station’ – thefive-sense ‘world’ – and allows us to interact with it. But the body is not whowe are. The we is actually an ‘I’ – Infinite Awareness, All That Is.Image [../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 6: The electromagnetic spectrum is currently estimated to be only 0.005per cent of what is said to exist in the universe … Image [../Images/00012.jpg]Figure 7: … and human sight can see only a fraction even of that 0.005 per cent.Humans are basically blind and perceive a tiny fraction of multi-dimensionalinfinite reality What has happened, however, thanks to the suppression of this knowledge by thepowers I shall expose, is that we have been manipulated to identify who we arewith the body-computer. This has led us to follow the computer programs andsoftware in our thoughts, emotions, reactions and perceptions while believingthem to be ‘us’. When we do this we become what I call ‘unconscious’, in that wedisconnect our point of observation, perception and decision-making from ourinfinite true self to follow the programmed thought and reaction running in thesoftware of the illusory self – the body-computer. At that point we are in thisworld and of it. We take on the same five-sense point of reference as thebody-computer, instead of knowing that the body is a vehicle for our InfiniteAwareness to experience this realm. When we are in the latter mode ofunderstanding, we are in this world in terms of five-sense experience, but weare not of it in terms of the awareness from which we observe and perceive. Whenpeople can’t communicate with each other and there is no mutual understanding,we talk of them being on ‘different wavelengths’. Yes, that’s precisely whatthey are. Because of this, those who speak of the world and life from theperspective of Infinite Awareness are seen as crazy and/or dangerous by thosewho are in computer mode. If you tried telling a computer it was beingcontrolled by a guy at a keyboard, and its reality was just one magnetic harddrive among hundreds of millions, it would symbolically dismiss you as a joke.We have lost this understanding and so instead of identifying who we are withmulti-dimensional Infinite Awareness, we identify with being Charlie Jones orMary Smith. This has locked us into a prison of illusion in which we seeourselves as small instead of All. We believe we are powerless when, in fact, weare All-powerful, All-possibility. What’s more, we have been systematicallyindoctrinated to forget who we really are. Only by suppressing this basicunderstanding can we be controlled on the scale that we daily experience. Mosthumans are operating on a fraction of their infinite potential as they areaccessing only a fraction of who they are. It is like having the mostsophisticated computer on the planet, with a hard drive full of files andgadgets, but only ever using Microsoft Word.René Descartes, the 17th century French philosopher, scientist andmathematician, said that the definition of life could be encapsulated in thephrase: I think, therefore I am. I can understand his theory when, on the faceof it, thought is the foundation of behaviour and what we call ‘personality’.But, after years of research into the nature of reality, and following my ownintuitive instincts, I would offer an update to Descartes: I compute, thereforeI am. The term ‘compute’ is defined by Cambridge Dictionaries Online as ‘tocalculate an answer or amount by using a machine’. Our ‘machine’ is thebody-computer. But are we using the ‘machine’ or is it using us? For billions,yes billions, of unconscious people it’s definitely the latter. We identify whowe are with our ‘personality’, which is made up, we believe, of our thoughts,emotions and actions. It is correct that our true self – Infinite Awareness –can dictate behaviour and perception through the body-computer when peoplebecome conscious, but that is not the only means through which we think,perceive and feel. In fact, for the majority of people Infinite Awareness is adistant onlooker providing the power source, but little more, while the bodycomputer-program controls events. This program is inherited when two hard drivescombine in procreation to create an ‘offspring’ copy that includes all theprograms that the parents inherited. Sometimes a child will inherit mental,emotional and physical traits from its parents, and sometimes it will come fromfurther ‘back’ in the program – a great grandparent for instance. This isdecided by which part of the genetic program the computer chooses to read. Theseprograms can have a fundamental effect on character traits and behaviour inpeople who are not conscious, and what we see as their obsessions, or focus, arejust the vehicles through which the programming can express itself. Take theexample of an extreme religious fanatic ‘personality’. He might be a Christianfanatic, but if his computer was born in an Islamic or Jewish society he wouldbe an extreme Muslim or Jew. You see this with addictive personalities, also.The addiction is in the computer program and it might mean addiction to drink,drugs, gambling, sex, shopping or a combination of them. Unless InfiniteAwareness intervenes, or the program is wiped or rewritten, it will find anoutlet for its addiction software in one way or another. The religiousextremists are addicted to dogma and imposing it upon others. The religionthrough which they choose to do this is the means – not the end. We have ashort-term and long-term memory, like a desktop computer, and we subconsciouslypress ‘save’ all the time as information that we want to keep goes permanentlyinto the ‘hard drive’, or DNA. As it does so, it is subtly changing the programof the body as a whole. When we have really powerful experiences, traumatic orotherwise, these have an especially significant impact on the program; they canrewrite the software and with it the way we react, think, feel and see theworld. For example, we may not have racist thoughts until either we or someonewe care for is attacked by someone of a certain race. This experience candownload as a deep hatred for anyone of that race, as the one experience becomesa generalisation. I once met a man who hated all black people after a black guyhad raped his wife. It could just as easily have been a white man, but it wasn’tand so the ‘I hate black people’ program was downloaded. Someone inheriting thatgenetics may have an ‘instinctive’ dislike of black people, while having noknown experiences to explain it.Software ‘personalities’I have heard it said by psychologists that there are only a small number of whatthey call archetypal ‘personalities’. Some say there are no more than twelvebasic ones. The Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung, sought to connect thesearchetypes to genetic inheritance and believed them to be instinctive. He saidwe are born with these patterns that structure our imagination and make itdistinctly human, and he suggested that archetypes are very closely linked toour bodies. Jung identified the 70 archetypal patterns in every culture andperiod of human history, and found that they mirrored the same archetypal ‘laws’in all cases. He suggested that a ‘Universal Unconscious’ was behind all this.Humans did not have separate, or personal, unconscious minds and instead shareda single Universal Unconscious, Jung said. What we call the conscious mind wasrooted in this, he believed, and to him the mind was shaped according touniversal patterns. I’d say that these archetypal patterns are the softwareprograms. Jung said personality traits are inherited and closely linked with thebody. Yes, they are, through the DNA. These are the patterns that, in his terms,make us ‘distinctly human’ – the human software program. Like everything in thisreality, ‘human’ is a computer construct and not who we really are.Psychiatrists and mainstream therapists who work with the ‘human mind’ are likecomputer tech-support and hypnotists are re-programmers. They are not dealingwith Infinite Awareness, but the computer ‘mind’. Infinite Awareness is AllPossibility and yet humans overwhelmingly fall into a few basic archetypalpersonalities. How can this be? It would seem to be a contradiction until werealise that we are looking at two distinctly different states of being. One ispure Awareness and the other is a computer program.While these programs are passed on through DNA, subsequent generations don’thave to develop such traits and responses. As with an inherited disease thatsome children get and others don’t, the ‘personality’ programs are sitting therewaiting to be triggered. A conscious person can overcome an inherited tendencythrough the enlightenment of Infinite Awareness, but a non-conscious person,following the program and thinking it is them, may fall into the inheritedresponse. This goes for all forms of fears, phobias and character traits thatdon’t appear to have any explanation in what has been experienced since birth.This can be a fear of dogs, when a dog has never harmed you; a fear of flying,when you have never been on a plane; a fear of water when you have never had abad experience with water. We can all list an endless number of examples inourselves and others – reactions that seem to have no logical explanation. Theyare inherited programs held in the DNA, and every time we have somethingpowerful happen to us we are downloading data that the next generation may haveto cope with or may benefit from. I would suggest that many of the reincarnation‘I was this or that in another life’ memories come from data held in the DNAhard drive. This inherited programming is one explanation for why many peoplewho have been regressed into ‘past lives’ have realised that the experiences ofa previous ‘incarnation’ are symbolised by traits in their body. Someone who hadhis throat cut (or has a body-program holding such a memory) in ‘another life’might have an unexplainable scar-like line on the throat; or a person who hadher hand smashed through torture might have a deformed hand in this ‘life’.These are mind and body memories held in the program, and at least many‘past-life regressions’ are opening up files holding that genetic memory.Transplant downloadsIt is taken as read, now, that we can inherit disease through our DNA, but it isfar more than that. We also inherit thought processes, attitudes, aptitudes,abilities and emotional traits in the body computer-program, and then take theseto be our ‘personality’ and who we are. What I am saying here explains some ofthe ‘mysterious’ changes that happen to people who have organ transplants.William Sheridan, a retired American catering manager, was in a New Yorkhospital awaiting a heart transplant when he began an art therapy course torelieve the boredom of lying in bed. His artwork was almost childlike and everybit as limited as my own. To put it mildly, William was not an artist. But, daysafter he was given his new heart he began to produce intricate drawings andpaintings. His art therapist, Beth DeFuria, said: ‘It was quite amazing how histalent blossomed’. William was flabbergasted. He had no idea where the talenthad suddenly come from, and neither had anyone else. He agreed to waive theusual anonymity between recipient and donor as part of a campaign to encouragemore people to donate organs and, as a result, he met the donor’s mother and hadthe chance to ask about her 24-year-old son, Keith Neville, a Wall Streetstockbroker who had died in a car crash. William asked if Keith had beenartistic in any way and she replied: ‘He was very artistic. He showed aninterest in art when he was just 18 months old. He always preferred to be givenart supplies rather than toys’. Somehow, William had inherited Keith’s artisticability through the transplantation of his heart. And this is no one-off. Therehave been many cases of organ recipients taking on the personality traits andabilities of the donor. William said his own personality had changed and he hadbecome more ‘caring and loving’. Other cases that doctors cannot explaininclude:> •A woman terrified of heights who became a mountaineer after receiving the> lungs of ... a mountaineer.> •A seven-year-old girl who had nightmares about being killed after she was> given the heart of a child who had been murdered.> •A man who had no interest in music, but then cried every time he heard the> singer, Sade, since receiving the heart of a Sade fan.> •A lawyer who had a sudden craving for Snicker chocolate bars after he was> given the heart of a fourteen-year-old with a craving for Snickers.> •A gay woman who became heterosexual after she was transplanted with the heart> of a teenage girl.These are just a few of so many examples, yet still medical opinion is generallysceptical about character and ability traits being transplanted with the organs.But then medical opinion is sceptical about anything that doesn’t fit with theversion of reality it has been programmed to believe in. The scepticism comesfrom lack of understanding and the need to defend the status quo – not fromknowledge of the subject. ‘Modern’ medicine is still in the Stone Age comparedwith what there is to know. What happens in these transplant examples is sosimple. The more I know the simpler it gets. All genius is simple at its corewhen the veil of complexity is removed. Put aside for a moment the apparentcomplexity of organs, blood vessels, brain stems, stomach linings and lungtissue (all of which are actually energy constructs with their own uniquefrequencies) and look at the simple truth behind it all. The body is abiological computer that is constantly storing and processing information. Fromthis perspective, what happens to transplant patients is obvious: the incomingorgan contains the mental and emotional programs of the donor in its cells/DNA.It contains their electrochemical and energetic make-up – their ‘personality’ –and it contains the information (inherited, experienced and developed) that wecall ‘aptitude’ and ‘attitude’. With the implantation, this information isdownloaded, like software, into the recipient’s biological computer system,including the auric fields. Therefore, the personality and ability programsbecome available to the recipient and, as in the example of William Sheridan,they can suddenly draw and paint in ways that they could not before. My greatfriend, Credo Mutwa, the famous Zulu sanusi or shaman in South Africa, tells methat at the time of cannibalism in southern and central Africa they had a strictrule that the unfortunate victim had to be boiled over a very hot fire. They hadseen from experience and heard from folklore that if the body was not properlycooked, the people who ate the victim ‘became him’, took on his ‘personality’.Boiling destroys the cells, or ‘hard drive’, and prevents the ‘download’ duringconsumption – much like heating a microchip until its circuits are buckled. Doeseating raw animal flesh make people more animal-like? Must do, I guess. Evensome in the medical field, those few with more open minds who have bothered todo research, are seeing the connections here. Gary Schwartz, a professor ofneurology, psychiatry and surgery at the University of Arizona, has led a teamresearching this transplant phenomenon. They studied 70 cases in which theprofessor believes abilities and character traits were transferred. He says:> When the organ is placed in the recipient, the information and energy stored> in the organ is passed on to the recipient. The theory applies to any organ> that has cells that are interconnected. They could be kidneys, liver and even> muscles. The stories we have uncovered are very compelling and are completely> consistent. Your body is not ‘you’All this supplies the critical key that unlocks the door to true understanding,both of who we are and our collective plight. What we call the human race hasbeen living under the most fundamental misunderstanding. It doesn’t know who itis and, without that prime coordinate, everything else is out of kilter. We havebeen identifying who we are with a biological computer and the electrochemicalprocesses we call ‘thought’ and ‘emotion’. That is not who we are, it is acomputer program. When ‘we’ think or feel emotions it triggers anelectrochemical process in brain and body as a result of the electrical signalsand chemicals it causes the body to transmit and release. In the same way, thereverse is true: chemicals and electrical fields can cause ‘us’ to feelemotions. This is why many people who live near to mobile phone masts andoverhead power cables, or who absorb certain chemicals, can feel depressed. Itis the same with so many children consuming chemical-infested food and drink whobecome subject to hyperactivity and other behaviour modification. It imbalancesthe electrochemical system and manifests as imbalanced behaviour. A Britishwoman suffered from clinical depression for forty years after she had manymercury-based dental fillings and she only emerged from it when the fillingswere replaced and she went on a mercury-detoxification programme. In all thattime she had no idea that her deep and dark depression, which involved periodsin mental institutions, was not ‘her’, but the result of the mercury’s effect onher body-computer system.If ‘we’ are our emotions, how can all this be? Chemicals should not affect theway we feel and think if the ‘I’ – Infinite Awareness – is the only source ofthem. But it isn’t. Those who have had near-death experiences when they have‘died’ and been revived have talked of going to a place of bliss and love inwhich they had no emotion, as they perceived emotion while in the ‘physical’body. I know what they are describing after experiencing that place throughother means. It is not that you are cold and callous in this non-emotionalstate; quite the opposite in fact. You feel indescribable love. It is human-typeemotion that is no longer there. Emotions are part of the computer software thatmanifest as programmed responses which are nothing more than electrochemicalreactions. And I mean reactions. Look at the way we live our lives all over theworld. We do it through emotional reactions – reacting according to program inthe face of stimuli that we call ‘experience’ and ‘information’. It is liketyping in a code, pressing ‘enter’, and the software held in the DNA andcellular network just follows its program. There is so often no consciousnessinvolved, as in Infinite Awareness. The thoughts and responses come from thebiological-computer level of perception. I have even observed how many peoplesuffer from what I call ‘emotional addiction’ in that they become addicted tothe chemicals that are released by different mental and emotional states. Thiscan be an addiction to the chemicals produced by depression, or worry or theadrenalin rush that comes from competition or danger. Such people constantlymanifest experiences, mostly subconsciously, that give them a ‘fix’ of theiremotional drug of choice. The cell receptors that absorb emotional chemicals arethe same ones that absorb heroin or cocaine. When we experience something, orsee or hear something, we ‘react’ to it, most often in the way that most otherswould react. People say: ‘What is your reaction to this or that?’, ‘Why did youreact that way?’ This is exactly what it is: a reaction, a chemical reaction.Almost every time, we react according to the DNA program, which we inherit andthen add to by the way we experience what we call ‘reality’. Trauma downloadedduring childhood is especially powerful in programming a lifetime of reactionand perception. These reactions are stored in the cells that act like computerchips. They store both the inherited program and the daily downloads that comefrom our experiences. It is the information stored in the cells/DNA that‘reacts’ to daily life on the basis of how the body-computer has been programmedto react. Most of what people call their ‘demons’ are inherited or downloadedsoftware programs running in the body-computer. Only by becoming truly consciouscan we break this cycle and begin to take control of our lives. At that point,the body-computer serves consciousness as a vehicle to experience this realityas it chooses. The computer is no longer the master and we start to live lifeinstead of life living us.There is a ‘hypnotist and personal-development trainer’ in the UK called PaulMcKenna, who is outstanding at what he does. I met him on a television programmeand he appeared to be a really nice guy. His big claim to fame is his ability tohelp people overcome their fears and phobias. He will meet people at the startof a TV show who are frightened of heights, spiders, flying, or whatever, andthen he brings them back at the end either far better or ‘cured’. What he isdoing is downloading alternative realities onto the computer and deleting theprogram that is causing the problem – fear of heights, spiders, flying, and soon. Implanting a donor organ (as with the lady who was frightened of heights,but then became a mountaineer) can have the same effect. It’s just a differentway of downloading the new information/reality into the brain/DNA.‘Man’ and ‘woman’ programsIt is not only our ‘personality’ that is a program; so is our gender andsexuality. At the level of Infinite Awareness we are neither male nor female,but the balance of both. We most closely identify who we think we are with ourgender (I am a man, I am a woman) when these, too, are electrochemical phenomenaor software programs. In 2006, British newspapers ran the story of Freaky thechicken who had begun life as a hen and for eight months had been happily layingeggs. Then ‘she’ began to sprout a scarlet comb, crow at dawn and tried to matewith other hens. Freaky had changed sex – mentally, emotionally and physically –and become a cockerel! This happened simply because, for some reason, ‘she’began to produce large amounts of testosterone and turned into a ‘he’. The wholeincredible transformation of sex and sexuality was caused by a chemical change.How can ‘we’ be a man or woman when chemistry decides if ‘we’ are one or theother?Once again, to identify with being a man or a woman is to identify with acomputer program. It is not that we need to deny we are a man or a woman or,indeed, the fact that we are an office worker, bus driver or airline pilot. Itis to understand that they are not who we are, but what we are experiencing.What we are is Infinite Awareness. Note, also, the programmed nature ofbehaviour when chemical changes caused Freaky the hen to start crowing at dawn.She/he may have thought ‘I’ll crow when the Sun comes up’, but, in truth, theelectrochemical program was deciding that. I get up early most mornings, and asthe Sun appears the birds begin to sing. Does anyone believe that they all havethe same instant thought at the same time that they’ll start to chirp? No, it’sthe collective computer-program being triggered. This is what so often happenswith humans when they think ‘they’ are having thoughts and emotions that lead toactions and behaviour. It’s not ‘them’, it’s the program. It is the same withsexuality and sexual preference. Just as the hen-turned-cockerel wanted to matewith the hens after a chemical change, so, too, is our sexuality dictated by ourcomputer programs and the chemical state that comes from them. Heterosexualityis an electrochemical software program, so is homosexuality, and, if the programchanges, as with the gay lady earlier who had the transplant, so can the form ofsexuality. The principle sex hormones are oestrogen (female) and testosterone(male). People who want to change their gender will sometimes take hormonetherapy in order to grow breasts or lower their voice, etc. It is similar towhat happened to Freaky the chicken. The period we call puberty, when teenagersgo through the chemical changes that lead to sexual maturity and adulthood, isalso the result of the body-computer releasing hormones into the system. It ispart of the unfolding computer-program that takes us from birth to old age.Infinite Awareness can intervene in this process, but non-conscious people (theoverwhelming majority) simply follow the software.Life after lifeWhat we call death is, ironically, ‘life’s’ greatest mystery. Is there lifeafter death? Where do we go? How can there be life after the body has died? Allthese questions can be answered once we understand the difference between thebody-computer and Infinite Awareness. As I have already outlined, InfiniteAwareness experiences this reality through the body-computer – akin to wearing agenetic spacesuit. Our lower levels of Awareness can, and mostly do, becomeconfused and identify with the computer. When the computer ceases to function –or ‘dies’ – our Awareness is released from the illusion and starts the processof remembering who it really is. This can be instant for those who were aware oftheir true identity before ‘computer death’, while for others it can take longerif their incarnate Awareness has become utterly dominated by its computeridentity. It is for this reason that there are so many stories of ‘ghosts’ that‘haunt’ locations where they once lived. What we call ghosts are oftendiscarnate entities, aspects of Awareness, who are still identifying self withthe computer they once occupied and they live in a limbo-land dimension veryclose to this one. It is the closeness of these frequency states that allows usto ‘see ghosts’. It is a bit like having interference between two radio stationsclose to each other on the dial. In the same way, people known as ‘psychics’ –genuine ones – have the ability to tune in to other frequencies and dimensionsand communicate with Awareness there. This is how they can connect with the‘departed’ and pass messages to loved ones. Instead of understanding what ishappening at ‘death’ – when Infinite Awareness is released from the computerreality – ‘ghosts’ go on believing that the ‘earthly’ self is who they are. Somepeople call them ‘earthbound souls’ or ‘lost souls’. Such is the identificationwith the former computer ‘self’ that they manifest as a mental projection ofwhat they once looked like in physical form. It is what they called in theMatrix movies ‘residual self-image’. When people see ghosts, they might see alittle child or an old man and later find that someone of that same descriptiononce lived there. Violent and traumatic deaths seem to produce this phenomenonmost often, although it can happen to anyone confused about their identity.There are other reasons for ghostly phenomena, but that’s one of them.My mother, Barbara, died in 2006 after a long and painful deterioration of hermental and physical health over nearly twenty years. In fact, it wasn’t ‘her’that was deteriorating, it was her body-computer. She struggled through it allwith great fortitude until so many compounding problems meant her computer couldno longer function. It was the point we call ‘death’, the most feared of allexperiences throughout human existence. It is the most extreme of the fears thatenslave us – fear of the unknown. It is the fear of death that keeps peoplequiet when they could reveal great secrets that would unveil the conspiracy I amexposing, and it makes people slaves of the medical profession and thepriesthood as they desperately try to stay alive or avoid some eternal ‘Hell’.Any form of fear is limiting, but fear of death is a spiritual and emotionalAlcatraz. I was frightened of dying when I was a child and even more frightenedthat my mother or father would die. My mother’s ill health would leave me sickwith worry when she was having one of her coughing fits that had to be seen tobe believed. My father was certainly frightened of death through fear of theunknown. He had been in the Army Medical Corps with the troops that moved upthrough Italy in the Second World War. In Naples, especially, he saw the abjectpoverty of the people amid the fantastic wealth of the Roman Church. It made himfiercely anti-religion for the rest of his days. Unfortunately, he equated anyidea of life after death with the religions he so despised, and he missed thepoint that life after death is not connected to any religion. It just is,whether you wave a cross, pledge your life to ‘Jesus’ or think that religion isa load of old bollocks. We have no need to seek eternal life – we already haveit. It’s a given. What kind of eternal life is the question, and the answer isdown to us, not some angry, vindictive, judgemental ‘God’.There was a time when my mother’s death would have been devastating to me andthe same with my father. But as I awakened to the reality of ‘life’, and thisillusory reality, I began to change my perception of this vibrational passing,or transition, that we call dying. The true nature of ‘death’ – in fact aseamless transition from life to life – was portrayed so well in the 1998 RobinWilliams film, What Dreams May Come. It is simply a withdrawing from thebiological computer, and, therefore, the frequency range or dimension in whichthe computer operates. Our Awareness then continues its eternal existence inother realms of reality. Naturally, our attachments to people and memories causeus to grieve when loved ones leave us and that’s understandable. My mind wasfull of re-emerging memories of my mother when it was her time to go. Iremembered when I was small how she used to sing a song called ‘The Little Boythat Santa Claus Forgot’ while polishing the stone floor. I would always cry andtell her that he could have my presents. I remembered when I was small how mymother would sometimes usher me to hide with her behind the sofa when there wasa knock on the door. She would tell me to be still and quiet – ‘Shhhhhhhhh!’.After a while, for a reason I didn’t understand at the time, she would say itwas okay to move. I later found out that those knocks were made by the rent manwho, some weeks, we didn’t have the money to pay. When he didn’t get a reply hewould look in the front window – hence the need to hide. I remembered smackingthe school dentist in the chest and making a run for it when he was about toapply the gas mask, and how I was a hundred yards down the street with my motherin pursuit, shopping bag soldered to her arm as always, shouting for me to stop.I remembered the way she would step from the bus, her legs apparently alreadymoving before they touched the ground, to rush off through the town from shop toshop as if someone had just shouted ‘Fire’. Whenever you went shopping with mymother you spent the entire time in her slipstream. I remembered when I phoned,she would announce to the room that it was ‘our Dave’ and how she never reallymastered the art of leaving answerphone messages. Three times I pressed thebutton at home to find the message go beep, beep, ‘Yar’. What? Yar? What was‘Yar’? It was later that I realised she had started to speak before therecording began and what she actually said was ‘I’m just ringing up to see howy’are’. There were so many memories as I said goodbye to my mother in thephysical form that I knew, but it was not the long goodbye, it was the nogoodbye. For I know she is there, only a vibration away, and we will meet again– Awareness to Awareness – when my work is done here. I know she is reunitedwith my father and he has told her that life is not like she thought it was. Ibet they had a right old giggle. As she would say in her unforgettable Leicesteraccent … ‘Yuh what? Yuh mean it wont real?’When a loved one goes, they can seem to take something of us with them becauseof the energetic connection. There’s a hole in your life that they once filledjust by the knowledge that they were there. So I grieved for the loss of themother I had known for almost exactly 54 years, but what was I grieving for?What do we all grieve for in these circumstances? If we understand the nature ofeternal life, or eternal Awareness as I prefer to call it, we grieve forourselves that the person is no longer with us. We may know that they live on,but they are no longer in the same vibrational field – their computer no longersitting in the chair next to you or waiting at the end of the phone. It is onlywhen we misunderstand the nature of life that we grieve for those who have leftus. For they have been released from the limitation of bodily illusion and theyare ‘reborn’ into other realms of reality. In truth, they never left thoserealms because we are the Infinite All, and the sense of division is part of theillusion in this bewildered world. My mother suffered from severe arthritic painfor decades and I know myself what that is like. She suffered from many serioushealth problems, especially after she was struck by a speeding driver some yearsago. In latter times, her body was constantly failing and her conscious mindflipped between clarity and confusion. Why should anyone grieve for her when shehad left that suffering to re-emerge in a paradise? I was relieved that herbattle was over and that she suffered no more, much as I miss her presence. Ihave never met or read of anyone who has had a near-death experience and wantedto come back. There are now fantastic numbers of documented accounts of peoplewho have left their bodies at ‘death’ and witnessed reality beyond this realm,only for their body to be revived. Dutch cardiologist Pim van Lommel produced amassive study of near-death experiences that supported the whole concept of lifeafter death, as well as raising questions about DNA, the collective unconsciousand the idea of ‘karma’. His findings were published in the British medicaljournal, The Lancet. Van Lommel’s interest was sparked 35 years ago when apatient told him about her near-death experience, but his serious study onlybegan after he later read a book called Return from Tomorrow in which theAmerican doctor, George Ritchie, detailed his own experience of ‘near-death’.Van Lommel began to ask all his patients if they remembered anything duringtheir cardiac arrests. These are just some of the accounts he recorded:> I became ‘detached’ from the body and hovered within and around it. It was> possible to see the surrounding bedroom and my body even though my eyes were> closed. I was suddenly able to ‘think’ hundreds or thousands of times faster,> and with greater clarity, than is humanly normal or possible. At this point I> realized and accepted that I had died. It was time to move on. It was a> feeling of total peace – completely without fear or pain, and didn’t involve> any emotions at all. [Note what I said earlier about emotions being body-computer phenomena.]> I was looking down at my own body from up above and saw doctors and nurses> fighting for my life. I could hear what they were saying. Then I got a warm> feeling and I was in a tunnel. At the end of that tunnel was a bright, warm,> white, vibrating light. It was beautiful. It gave me a feeling of peace and> confidence. I floated towards it. The warm feeling became stronger and> stronger. I felt at home, loved, nearly ecstatic. I saw my life flash before> me. Suddenly I felt the pain of the accident once again and shot back into my> body. I was furious that the doctors had brought me back. This experience is a> blessing for me, for now I know for sure that body and soul are separated, and> that there is life after death. It has convinced me that consciousness lives> on beyond the grave. Death is not death, but another form of life. > I saw a man who looked at me lovingly, but whom I did not know. [Later] … At> my mother’s deathbed, she confessed to me that I had been born out of an> extramarital relationship, my father being a Jewish man who had been deported> and killed during the Second World War, and my mother showed me his picture.> The unknown man that I had seen years before during my near-death experience> turned out to be my biological father. The tunnel, the bliss, being met by long-passed loved ones, and thedisappointment at having to come back are constant themes of near-deathexperiences. Van Lommel said that when some people return they often have asense of being imprisoned, compared with the freedom they had brieflyexperienced. Others say it transformed their lives and they all lose their fearof death. This understanding would free everyone from this ultimate fear andthat is why this knowledge has been systematically suppressed – for reasons Iwill come to later. The Hidden Hand I am going to expose wants the population infear of death, in fear of everything. When people are in a state of fear theyare most easily controlled and manipulated. Van Lommel says:> The most important thing people are left with is that they are no longer> afraid of death. This is because they have experienced that their> consciousness lives on, that there is continuity. Their life and their> identity don’t end when the body dies. They simply have the feeling they’re> taking off their coat. Exactly, exactly. What passes through that ‘tunnel’, what makes the transition,is our consciousness – our Awareness. The computer is buried or cremated, notthe Awareness that provided its power source. Van Lommel says of ‘death’:> At that moment these people are not only conscious; their consciousness is> even more expansive than ever. They can think extremely clearly, have memories> going back to their earliest childhoods and experience an intense connection> with everything and everyone around them. And yet the brain shows no activity> at all! What is consciousness and where is it located? What is my identity?> Who is doing the observing when I see my body down there on the operating> table? What is life? What is death? The answers come in one short sentence: They are different states of Awarenessand that Awareness is located everywhere. You can have body Awareness orInfinite Awareness or something between the two. Van Lommel points out that thebrain does not produce consciousness or store memories. He says that Americancomputer-science expert, Simon Berkovich, and Dutch brain researcher, HermsRomijn, both working independently of each other, found it was impossible forthe brain to store even a fraction of our thoughts and experiences. Van Lommel’sconclusions from his research are the same as I have been outlining here. Thebody/brain is a receiver/transmitter of information like a computer ortelevision. He says:> You could compare the brain to a television set that tunes into specific> electromagnetic waves and converts them into image and sound. Our waking> consciousness, the consciousness we have during our daily activities reduces> all the information there is to a single truth that we experience as> ‘reality’. During near-death experiences, however, people are not limited to> their bodies or their waking consciousness, which means they experience many> more realities. All of which is precisely what I have written in previous books and continue inthis one. He even says that DNA, not least the 95 per cent of so-called ‘junkDNA’ that ‘science’ knows nothing about, is a receiver/transmitter ofinformation. The truth is coming out at last. We are not our bodies; we areconsciousness, Awareness. It is this which is released at what we call ‘death’to potentially experience the limitless freedom that awaits us all beyond the‘laws’ of this manipulated illusion. Van Lommel’s view of life was transformedby what he discovered and this knowledge has been systematically suppressed tostop everyone having the same transformation:> I now see that everything stems from consciousness. I better understand that> you create your own reality based on the consciousness you have and the> intention from which you live. I understand that consciousness is the basis of> life, and that life is principally about compassion, empathy and love. Yes it is. Infinite love, Infinite Awareness, is the only truth – everythingelse is illusion. My mother did not die. My mother cannot die. Her biologicalcomputer ceased to operate and her eternal Awareness departed to whence it came.When her family’s computers do the same we will be reunited in mutual Awarenessand have a bloody good laugh at what we all did, thought and said while caughtin this web of illusory disconnection.The life force sparklesOn the morning of my mother’s funeral, I was asked if I wanted to see her bodyin the coffin at the undertakers. I would normally have said ‘no, I willremember her as she was’, but something urged me to go. I am glad I did becauseI saw the difference so clearly between a dead computer and eternal life. Mymother’s body was lying there as lifeless as a switched-off computer. The bodywas cold, just as a computer cools when its electric life force is withdrawn.Next to the coffin was a blown-up picture of my mother that my brother, Paul,had organised for the funeral. The body may have been dead, but that picture wasalive. It had captured her smile, the sparkle in the eyes, the energy andAwareness that was the real ‘her’ (Figure 8). Her presence permeated the roomfrom this image because photographs can capture the energy signature, as well asthe physical form, and can provide the vibrational connection that allowsdeparted Awareness to express itself in this reality as an energy, a feelingthat ‘my mother is here’. I stood there looking at a dead computer and a picturefull of life, and the essence of who we really are had never been clearer ormore profound for me.Image [../Images/00013.jpg]Figure 8: My mum. Looking at this picture next to her open coffin I couldclearly see the life force that had left her body at what we call ‘death’ The sparkle in the eyes that says ‘life’ is one of the biggest signs ofconsciousness. You see it most clearly when people are laughing and happy.Infinite Awareness is love, bliss, joy, and expresses itself most obviouslythrough laughter. When people are operating in computer mode alone, they havewhat we actually call ‘dead eyes’. There is no life there – no spark. This is tobe expected when the computer program is running the show and Awareness isstanding in the wings. What pain and suffering has been caused by the religionswhich talk of judgement days and some ‘God’ choosing who does and doesn’t haveeternal life. They tell us that only if we believe in the non-existent ‘Jesus’can we qualify for eternity, or if we believe in Allah and his prophet,Mohammed, and all that stuff. How about those who have lived in parts of theworld where they had never heard of Jesus or Mohammed or Allah? What is this,then – eternity by zip code? What bollocks it all is, this mercilessmanipulation of the fear of death in pursuit of religious compliance which, inthe end as we shall see, is controlled by the same few interbreeding families nomatter if it be Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, or whatever. My brother, Paul,arranged for a vicar to conduct our mother’s funeral on the advice of thecrematorium staff who said the vicar knew the format and would make sureeverything ran to the allotted time. It was a very different funeral apart fromthat, but the vicar had to bring in his religion in his opening remarks. Hetalked about everyone being ‘sinners’ and asked ‘God’ to accept this ‘sinner’ –my mother – into eternal life. What a disgrace that religion has caused so muchgrief and trauma for people over thousands of years as they worry if their lovedones have gone to Heaven or Hell or some lights-out oblivion. God save us fromreligion. What ignorance it has visited upon the world – and not by accidenteither. As the Chinese philosopher, Chang Tzu, put it:> The birth of a man is the birth of his sorrow. The longer he lives, the more> stupid he becomes, because his anxiety to avoid unavoidable death becomes more> and more acute. What bitterness! He lives for what is always out of reach! His> thirst for survival in the future makes him incapable of living in the> present. The fear of death, and the fear of the death of those we love, ensures that wecease to live life, and instead – consciously and subconsciously – fear theinevitable death. But it’s not inevitable, for it does not exist, except in ourdeluded perception. There is only life, only Awareness. We thirst to survivewhen we should thirst to live, to be joyous. In truth, there is only love. It isin untruth that all the other crap appears to exist. My mother and Paul wereincredibly close, and the way he looked after her was simply magnificent. Often,a departed loved one will try to manifest signs to show that they have notceased to be, and in the days after she left, right up to the funeral andbeyond, Paul had a series of strange experiences relating to electricalequipment, watches, mobile phones and the time of 11.30am. This was the time thefuneral was going to begin, and Paul’s experiences included his phone turningitself off and on at 11.30am and the emergency services calling him to ask whyhe had rung them – at 11.30am – when he had made no such call. When we areoperating on other dimensions the easiest way to have an influence in this worldis via electrical equipment through a vibrational connection that affectselectrical circuitry. People can stop watches by projecting their thoughtsbecause thoughts are electrical and vibrational phenomena – hence ‘brainwaves’ –and they can be used to block the watch’s electrical circuits. Such thoughtwaves can also be projected from other dimensions into this one and have asimilar effect. When this happens people will often say that a place is‘haunted’.In 2003, I had an experience in a Brazilian rainforest where an incredibleother-dimensional energy was passing through me. While it was happening, themusic player turned itself off and on and three striplights burst into lifewithout anyone going near a switch. Paul also experienced an energy pass throughhim when he walked into our mother’s bedroom. He said it felt like a powerfultingling sensation throughout his body, and the hairs on the back of his neckstood up in response to what was an electrical field. At the same time, hismobile phone switched off as its circuits were temporarily broken. The samenight, he was listening to our mother’s favourite music to compile a tape forthe funeral. As he did so, he said all the heat went out of the room and itbecame extremely cold. He turned on the fire, but it made no difference and Iknow the kind of fierce heat that this fire generates. There are endless storiesof rooms going cold when ghosts are seen, or other strange things are happening.I have experienced it many times myself. It is caused by the discarnate entity,or Awareness, sucking energy out of the room to make the energetic connectionbetween dimensions. As this heat and energy is absorbed so the temperaturefalls. What we call ‘global warming’ is the opposite of that – more energy iscoming into this dimension via the Sun and so the temperature must rise. More ofthat later. The fact that Paul was playing our mother’s favourite music at thetime is also highly significant. Music is a most obvious expression of vibrationand it can act as a conduit to connect two people in different realms who havean association with the music. As they both resonate to the music through thememories they share, it can create a mutual point of connection. When psychicsare trying to communicate with the departed they will often ask for somethingthat the person wore close to them, like a watch or a ring, which carries theirunique vibrational signature and makes tuning in far easier. It’s like knowingthe frequency of the radio station you are looking for instead of running up anddown the dial until you find it.‘Primitive’ geniusUnderstanding that everything is the same Infinite Awareness starts to unravelthe ‘mysteries’ that modern ‘scientists’ dismiss as mumbo-jumbo to hide the factthat they are simply beyond the comprehension of their programmed minds. Oneexample is the technique of ‘divination’ or ‘reading the future’, like Tarotcards, rune stones and, as with my friend Credo Mutwa (Figure 9), ‘throwing thebones’. Credo and his wife Virginia, like all African ‘sangomas’ or shamans,‘throw the bones’ to find answers to questions or predict the ‘future’. Theyhave done it for me on a couple of occasions with impressive accuracy. They workwith sets of animal bones carved with – or as – different symbols (Figure 10).The people being ‘read’ put their hands over the basket of bones to make anenergetic connection and then the bones are thrown across the floor. Where theyland and the relationship they have with each other allows a skilled ‘reader’like Credo to answer your question or predict the likely ‘future’. When this wasfirst done for me it was obvious that it was the African version of the runestones or Tarot cards. It was the same knowledge, once widely known, that isexpressed in different ways in different cultures. To those who are programmedto believe the official propaganda, such things are the work of primitive ‘witchdoctors’, ‘crazies’, and the like. Personally, I have rarely come acrossanything as primitive as mainstream ‘science’ or as crazy as mainstream‘society’. In fact, the principle on which these methods of divination work arefar more advanced than anything our Stone Age ‘science’ can offer or explain.People lose the plot when they see only the ‘physical’ level of everything – thetiny frequency range that our eyes can access. Only when you realise that thetrue nature of everything is energy does the world come into focus. When youlook at the bones you are actually looking at energy fields, and the symbolsdictate the vibrational nature of that energy. The symbols are ‘physical’expressions of thought and they carry the vibrational code or signature of thethought or concept they represent. I once had a powerful experience of thisprocess when I was walking up the steps inside a massive obelisk, which is theancient symbol of the male phallus. After a minute or so, while day-dreamingaway thinking of nothing, things began, shall we say, to stir down below. ‘Whatthe hell is all that about?’ was my immediate thought, until I remembered whereI was – inside a symbolic penis. The phallic symbolism vibrated the energy tothe frequency field of male sexual energy. This is the reason that certainconstantly-repeating symbols are placed all around us, as we shall see later inthe book. The energy fields in which we live are being manipulated. As the bonesare carved to represent different symbols (thoughts, concepts) they areimprinted with the energy field they symbolise and they then vibrate to thatfrequency matrix. When you put your hands over the bones at the start of thereading, you are imprinting your own energy field which is an energeticrepresentation of your mental, emotional and subconscious self. The subconsciousself, the deeper self, is aware of far more than the conscious, to say the veryleast, and it knows the projected ‘future’ that the conscious level cannot see.Image [../Images/00014.jpg]Figure 9: Credo Mutwa, one of the most amazing people I have had the privilegeto know Image [../Images/00015.jpg]Figure 10: Throwing the bones: Where they land in relationship to each other canbe ‘read’ by a skilled sangoma, or shaman All this is imprinted on the bones and, while they are still in the basket, theymake an energetic or electromagnetic connection through what I call vibrationalmagnetism. The vibrational fields of the different symbols form a vibrational‘web’ while still in the basket by connecting with those parts of the person’senergy field that the symbols represent. One of the bones that Credo andVirginia threw for me on one occasion was carved as a car, and so anything in myenergy field that relates to something to do with a car will connect with thatparticular bone because they operate on the same wavelength. So even before thebones are thrown, the place where they will fall and the relationship they havewith each other on the floor has already been decided by the energetic andmagnetic connections made between the person and the bones. It is the sameprinciple as throwing magnets tuned to different ‘attraction’ frequencies. Somewill be magnetically drawn to each other and some will repel and be pushedapart. This is the profound understanding of reality that mainstream ‘science’doesn’t understand, but the true carriers of the knowledge do. The sameprinciple applies to the Tarot cards and rune stones, and other forms ofdivination. When you select certain cards, apparently at random, during a Tarotreading, the same energy connection is taking place between your energy fieldand those of the symbolic cards. This is why you pick one card rather thananother. It is all happening on an energetic level and the connection is instantand requires no thought. Indeed, thought can get in the way of the process.I asked Credo what happens to him when he is reading the bones as they lie onthe floor. Part of his ability to read comes from assessing the relationship ofthe symbols to each other, but there is another level to this also. He said thatwhen he reads the bones he goes to the ‘silent place’, or ‘silent cave’, where‘past, present and future all meet and everything is one’. I have been there andI know exactly what he means. It is in this ‘place’, this state of unified‘Oneness’, that Credo says he can ‘talk with the bones’. How is this possible?Because all is energy, and all energy is consciousness. When you enter thatstate of unity, where all is One, you can communicate with the consciousnessthat is the bones and symbols, or the consciousness that is the animals andplants. At that level they are all are on the same ‘wavelength’. Again, theproblem is that people get stuck in the ‘physical’ perception of everything andthe manipulators of society encourage them to do so through the ‘education’system, ‘science’ and the media. When they hear about those who say they talk tothe plants or animals the immediate response is laughter and ridicule. Bothreactions are the offspring of ignorance; stupidity always sees humour ingenius. They think that talking to animals means that a cow or a crocodile musthave to understand human language. To think that such people have the nerve tolaugh at others. Language is only a physical expression of thought and it is bythought – telepathy – that such communication takes place. Telepathy has nolanguage, or, put another way, it is all language. Thought communication betweenan Englishman and an Italian will be decoded into English and Italian when thethought fields are processed through the brain into a language it understands.So it is with animals and plants. Telepathy is not a language of words; it is a‘language’ of awareness. The Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert region of SouthAfrica, also known as the Basarwa or San people, are among many nativecommunities who communicate telepathically as a matter of course. Their mutualDNA frequency code can be sent and received between them, and this, togetherwith a connection through Infinite Awareness, is the origin of the term ‘bushtelegraph’.One mind, many facesCredo’s wife, Virginia, talks every day to the plants that she grows for thetraditional medicines she uses to treat patients for AIDS and other problems(Figure 11). She tells the plants about the patient and asks them to help. Shetakes only as much of the plant as the patient needs and the plants don’t die asa result. They are involved in the process of healing through this telepathiccommunication, and respected for what they are – consciousness. When a piece ofthe plant is taken, she will place money next to the plant in thanks. I can hearthe sceptics now … ‘What is the plant going to do with it – buy a beer?’ Ofcourse it is symbolic, but actually more than that. It is an energy exchange inline with the principles I have been discussing here. The coin is the physicallevel of energy and it is the energy of thanks and respect that the plant isable to absorb as a result of having the money placed close by. It doesn’t putthe money in its pocket, it absorbs the energy that the money represents. Thisis the knowledge that has been carried by the few at often great danger and muchconsequence, but lost to society as a whole.Image [../Images/00016.jpg]Figure 11: Credo’s wife, Virginia, talking to the plants. They can communicate,because everything is One It is the same with the mountains, hills and other places that have beenbelieved to be special or ‘sacred’ since ancient times. It is the energy theyare talking about, not just the physical location. Take Mount Shasta, anenormous volcano, 14,161 feet high and the second highest of the Cascade Rangethrough Northern California. The mountain dominates the skyline over an enormousarea and for mere physical beauty alone it staggers the senses, like a godsurveying its kingdom. But, awesome as it is to the eye, it is in the unseenrealms that I most connect with what I call ‘Magic Mountain’. It is sheer, raw,energetic power and, in the words of my friend, Shalomar, who lives on itsslopes, the mountain ‘strips you naked’. In other words, those who go there withintent to transform their awareness from ‘Bill Jones’ to All Possibility willfind the intent is granted in ways they don’t always appreciate. All that isdetrimental to achieving the intent crumbles and falls within the ‘outer’ lifeof things like relationships, jobs and daily experience. This happens becausethe energetic baggage and software programs are ‘stripped away’ by themountain’s incredible vibrational field, and when the ‘inner’ transforms itsstate and awareness, so the ‘outer’ must express that because one is merely areflection of the other. The mountain does not choose to change you – you chooseto change yourself by going there, and the mountain goes to work on those withthe intent to beat to a different drum. It is the same with many of these‘sacred’ places all over the world.People talk of ‘the mountain’ and, of course, within five-sense reality, that’swhat it is. But it is also an energy field – an Awareness – and this is the truesignificance of Mount Shasta and other such places. Mountains have always beenat the heart of so many legends in every culture, as with Olympus (Greece),Kailash (Tibet) and Fuji, or Fujiyama (Japan). The sacred mountains are oftensaid to be the home of the supreme Creator and you can understand that with thesymbolism of high mountain = omnipotent God. Within the myths and legends ofevery expression are so many sparkling truths disguised amid the symbolic andthe metaphor. We may be able to talk about energy fields, electromagnetism andcomputers, for instance, but the ancients had to describe their beliefs throughthe culture of their day. Although we can explain how the vibrational field of amountain interacts with the human energy-field to bring about ‘spiritualtransformation’, how could the ancients, or those even a hundred years ago, usesuch terms? They might speak of the Mountain God or the Great Spirit or thelegend of the Mountain Eagle that flies into your heart. When we fail tounderstand the parable nature of many myths, we can see them as the strangebeliefs of a primitive people. Sometimes, yes, that is true, but far fromalways. These sacred mountains, including Shasta, are often said to beinterdimensional doorways or gateways through which ‘spiritual entities’,commonly perceived in legend as ‘the gods’, can move in and out of this reality.Once again, this can be understood through the emergence of quantum physics andthe understanding that this is but one reality, one frequency range ofperception, and the apparently ‘solid’ landscape is actually an energy grid ormatrix decoded in our heads, as I will explain in the next chapter.I mentioned earlier about the human meridian-system, or ‘circuit board’, throughwhich the chi energy flows, and the picture of the experiment with the injectedtracer dye. The Earth has a similar meridian or ‘ley line’ network thatcriss-crosses the planet in basically the same way, carrying its chi energy –which is information like that passing around a computer. The Earth is nodifferent to the human body in the sense that the slower or faster this energy –information – flows below or above optimum, the less healthy the planet becomes.Like humans, the Earth has acupuncture points along these ley lines where theflow can be adjusted and there are vortices or ‘chakras’, where lines cross.Where two lines cross they combine to create a small vortex of energy, and wherelots of them meet the vortex is massive. These are the ‘power centres’ ofancient and modern folklore, and it is where those with the knowledge locatedthe great temples, stone circles like Stonehenge and Avebury, the pyramids andother extraordinary creations. It has been noted that these wonder structures ofthe ancient world are geometrically aligned with each other all over the planetand this has been a mystery to the academic community. How did they do it, these‘primitive’ people? Well, it is not a mystery at all. The Earth’s energy grid isa geometrical network and, therefore, if you place your temples or stone circleson this grid they will be, by definition, geometrically aligned also.Which brings me back to mountains. The ‘sacred’ mountains of legend, like MountShasta, are located at major vortex points on the grid where the energy is sopowerful and focused that it can, indeed, connect through like wormholes intoother dimensions and allow other-dimensional entities to move between them. Itis said that Mount Shasta is the place ‘where Heaven and Earth meet’. You cansee the origin of such beliefs when the wider picture unfolds and they are notrelated only to the mountain’s great height. Given this background, it is nosurprise that all the Native American tribes in Northern California had theirmost important legends about Mount Shasta, and today it is a focus for NewAgers, Buddhists, and those, like myself, who wonder at its beauty and spirit.People who see the world only in physical terms – what you ‘see’ is what you get– will not understand such a concept. To them it is crazy that a mountain canhave a spirit. When you realise that the ‘mountain’ is, like everything else, anenergy, a consciousness, then a ‘mountain’ can not only be a centre of power,but a centre of wisdom, too – especially with so many lines of informationmeeting at that point. This is the emerging awareness that I am seeing amongthose who are ready to remember that ‘human’, ‘wolf’, ‘tree’ or ‘mountain’, areall ONE. One consciousness, one cosmos, one infinity.Time to rememberHow do we become who we really are – Infinite Awareness, Infinite Love – whilstin this computerised madhouse? We stop thinking and we start to ‘know’. Knowingdoesn’t come through thought, or the processes of brain and body-computer. It isfelt – known – through intuition, which is the manifestation of InfiniteAwareness. It is a distinctive resonance, a feeling of yes, yes, yes, that Ifeel in the centre of my chest and no, no, no in my solar plexus when knowingbegins to flow. The centre of the chest and solar plexus are both chakra points,the vortices that interpenetrate multi-dimensions and can be opened to accesshigher levels of perception and understanding. Knowing does not need to explainitself or source its material. It just knows, nothing more necessary. Andknowing can be unique to the knower. What I know is right for me, may not beright for anyone else. I will explore the theme at more length later, but, as Iwrote in my last book, Infinite Love is the Only Truth – Everything Else isIllusion:> We don’t need to learn, we need to unlearn what the program has manipulated us> to believe. Mind is not the road to enlightenment; it is the barrier to it.> Knowledge and knowing are not the same thing – one is mind, the other> consciousness [Infinite Awareness]. We don’t need to learn, but to awaken from> the hypnotic trance and remember who we are. When we do, we cease to think and> start to know. Some call this intuition or ‘following the heart’ and it comes> from a far more aware level of consciousness than is usually at large in this> reality … > … The program seeks to suppress this by using mind and emotion to pressure us> to consider the consequences of intuitive decisions, feel guilty for doing> things that knowing urges us to do and question how ‘little me’ could possibly> know anyway. This reluctance to accept the magnitude and infinity of who we> are is the biggest block to reaching a state of knowing. We have intuitive> knowing and then immediately begin to doubt it. That is the program kicking in> to protect its control. We don’t need to learn; we need to remember – remember who we are. Once we openourselves to intuitive knowing rather than just intellectual thinking,everything changes. We begin to expand our perception to encompass InfiniteAwareness and, as we do so, the biological computer-program ceases to enjoy thesame monopoly on our sense of reality. As we change, so the world we manifestchanges and we are never the same again. So often I have known what is happeningwith regard to a world event only for the five-sense confirmation to come laterin the realm of thought and research. We really are All-Knowing, but we let mindand emotion – programs – block us from that infinite source. When we identifywith the computer, we think small; when we identify with Infinite Awareness wecan know All. The computer thinks in division and polarity, while Awarenessknows there is only One.Put simply:For unconscious people it is: ‘I compute, therefore I am’.For conscious people it is: ‘I am, therefore I am’."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 2 So where are we? > Conditioned Awareness is where we live our lives in guilt over the past and> anxiety over the future and never get to experience the present. > Russell Targ Reality seems so simple at first. We live in a world of physical objects likebuildings, trees, trains and mountains. We have physical bodies, and when welook through our eyes we see a ‘solid’ landscape all ‘around’ us. I grant you,it definitely seems that way and we are encouraged to believe in this reality bythose in authority, mainstream ‘science’ and ‘education’. In fact, the ‘world’is not like that at all, it just appears to be.For a start, what we perceive to be ‘physical’ and ‘solid’ is anything but.Science says that what we see as ‘form’ – people, buildings, landscape etc. –are made of atoms. Okay, but the trouble with the ‘solid world’ theory is thatatoms are not solid. More than that, they are basically empty. How can somethingthat is not solid create a solid environment? It can’t. Atoms consist ofelectrons orbiting a nucleus (protons and neutrons), but it is the proportionsthat tell the story. Atoms are more than 99 per cent empty space to our humanreality, yet they are described as the fundamental building-blocks of matter –yes, ‘solid’ matter. The proportions between the nucleus, electrons and ‘emptyspace’ shown in Figure 12 are nothing like they really are because the size ofthe page makes it impossible to show the true dimensions, so vast is the ‘empty’bit. One writer said that if you take an atom to be the size of a cathedral thenucleus would be the size of a ten-cent piece. An atom is anelectrical-vibrational field and not a solid object. First clue to ‘Where arewe?’: atoms do not make up our solid world because the world isn’t solid. Theyare, however, part of the process of constructing the illusion of solidity.Image [../Images/00017.jpg]Figure 12: The atoms that form ‘physical’ matter are anything, but ‘physical’.So how come everything looks so ‘solid’? It’s all an illusion constructed in ourminds Another revelation for spacesuit-believers and solid-world theorists: when youlook around a room, or landscape, it appears to be outside of you, and you seemto be ‘in’ your environment. But, in terms of apparently three-dimensional*reality, your environment is in you. It only appears to be ‘around’ you becauseof the illusion you are decoding. And what you decode are frequency fields.There is no ‘solid’ world ‘outside’ of you. All those people, streets, cars andbuildings only exist, in that ‘solid’ 3D state, in your mind. Everywhere else,they are frequency fields, thought fields, energy matrices, call them what youwill. Television and the Internet are perfect illustrations of what I am talkingabout here. When we think of television we think of pictures and programmes, butthe only place television exists in that form is on the TV screen. Everywhereelse television consists of frequency broadcasts and electrical circuitry. Whenwe think of the Internet we think of websites, pictures and graphics, but theonly place the Internet exists in that form is on your computer screen.Everywhere else it consists of mathematical codes and electrical circuitry.Television was developed thanks to the discoveries of the Frenchman, Jean B. J.Fourier in the early 19th century. He identified a mathematical system ofconverting patterns into simple waveforms and back again that became know asFourier transform. From this, came the means for a television camera to convertpictures into electromagnetic frequencies and for the television set to convertthem back again. When I post items to my website I put in mathematical computercodes and when I press ‘enter’ they appear on the screen in the form of graphicsand pictures. Once again, the same principle applies to our ‘physical’ realityas our brain decodes frequency fields into an apparently ‘solid’ world. Thebrain is like the TV or computer screen – the only place where the ‘world’exists in the form we recognise.Decoding realityThe brain, the central processing unit of the body-computer, is the processorand decoder of information that decides what we see, hear, touch, taste andsmell, among so much else. The five senses manifest in our conscious realityonly when electrical signals have been sent from the eyes, ears, skin, tongueand nose for the brain to decode. If the brain can be tricked into decoding themin a different way, as with a stage hypnotist for example, you can be eating onething and tasting another. This is vitally important to understanding how oursense of reality is constantly being manipulated, as we shall see. The fivesenses are frequency decoders that transform frequency fields into electricalsignals. The brain then decodes these signals into an apparently ‘solid’ worldof street scenes and landscapes that only exist in that form in our heads(Figure 13). Even the term ‘our heads’ is another level of the illusion. Thebody and brain are also frequency matrices that only exist in the form that weseen them when they pass through the same decoding system. While I will use theterm ‘brain’ to keep it simple, I am actually talking about the energy matrixthat is the brain in its frequency-field form. It is the energy matrix that isdoing the decoding and the brain is only its physical expression. When someonehas a near-death experience and leaves the body, they can still see because inthe end everything is energy-consciousness (Awareness) and the body is anillusion. It is the same with the five senses. Our eyes, ears, noses, tonguesand skin, are only the ‘physical’ (decoded) expressions of energy fields. Theears are obvious frequency decoders in that the eardrum transforms the vibrationof sound into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. It is the brainthat decides what we actually ‘hear’. The eyes transform ‘light’ (energy,frequency fields) into electrical signals which the brain then interprets intoapparently three-dimensional reality via its visual cortex. We actually ‘see’the ‘physical’ world with our brain – not our eyes. In fact, the whole DNAcomputer system network is involved in decoding our reality, not just the brain.This frequency-decoding process by the body-computer operates only within thefrequency range of this dimension, or ‘television station’, and if we experienceand perceive purely through the five senses, we disconnect (consciously, notliterally) from our multi-dimensional Infinite Awareness. We become trappedwithin a tiny range of perception, while often believing it to be all that thereis. This is the reality-state of spacesuit-believers who ridicule those whospeak of other dimensions and other realities. To these people there are noother realms. They are so encased in the computer-level of perception that theycannot even begin to conceive of the possibility, let alone sense them.Image [../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 13: We think the world we see is outside of us when it is actuallyconstructed in the brain, or, more accurately, the energy matrix that is thebrain Image [../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 14: How a hologram is made. One part of the laser light (the ‘workingbeam’) is deflected onto the subject and then onto a photographic plate. Theother part (the ‘reference beam’) is directed straight at the photographicplate. When the two parts collide they form an interference pattern that is awaveform version of the subject being photographed Image [../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 15: The interference pattern looks like a fingerprint and appears to berandom wavy lines, but when a laser is directed at this pattern an apparently‘solid’ three-dimensional image appears To summarise: the ‘physical’ world is a tiny frequency range or dimension withinInfinite Awareness – the ‘ocean’. The body-computer tunes us into this strictlylimited sense of perception, this television channel, and acts as our vehicle tointeract with this ‘world’. We have been manipulated into believing that ‘we’are the computer and its mental, emotional and physical software programs. Thisdimension, like all the others, is a mass of frequency fields that thebody-computer decodes into apparently 3D scenes, but in that form they onlyexist in the brain or, more accurately, the energy matrix we call the brain.There is no ‘physical’ world unless it is observed into form – decoded intoform. The writer Carlos Castaneda quotes his shaman source, Don Juan, as saying:> We are perceivers. We are awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity.> We are boundless … We, or rather our reason, forget [this] and thus we entrap> the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in> our lifetime. Image [../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 16: All of these images are holograms. They look ‘solid’, but you couldput you hand through them because they are illusions. Our ‘physical’ reality isjust the same. It is our belief in its solidity that means we experience‘solidity’ (The pictures ‘Little Birch’, ‘Old Soldier’ and ‘Rose2’ are courtesy ofHolography Studio, All-Russian Exhibition Center, Moscow. For more, seewww.holography.ru [http://www.holography.ru]. The picture ‘Running Tap’ iscourtesy of 3-D Hologrammen, Amsterdam. For more, see www.3-Dhologrammen.com[http://www.3-Dhologrammen.com]) Holographic illusionsNext question: why does everything look so ‘real’, solid and three-dimensionalif it’s all an illusion? To answer this we need to understand holograms. Mostpeople will have seen the holographic pictures in the shops where a flat imagesuddenly transforms into 3D when light strikes it at the appropriate angle.Holograms are not really 3D or ‘solid’, they just appear that way. So it is withour whole reality. The holograms we can buy are made by directing two parts ofthe same laser onto photographic film (Figure 14). One part (the ‘referencebeam’) is directed at the film through a semi-transparent mirror, while theother half (the ‘working beam’) is deflected away to strike the object to beholographically photographed. The working beam is then directed back onto thephotographic film where it collides with the reference beam. This creates on thefilm what is called an ‘interference pattern’, and it is similar to throwing twopebbles into a pond and having their two wave patterns collide, causing a web ofinterference. The pattern in the water is like a vibrational, or waveform,representation of the stones and their point and speed of entry – and it is thesame with the laser patterns on the film. They are a vibrational or waveportrayal of the object being photographed. The wave patterns look like a seriesof random lines, a bit like fingerprints (Figure 15), but when a laser isdirected at the film, a three-dimensional image suddenly comes into view. What’smore, these holograms can look as solid as our world seems to be when, in fact,you can put your hand through them. Their solidity is an illusion (Figure 16).Image [../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 17: ‘Outside’ of us there is only energy and vibrational thought fields.The subconscious creates and interacts with wave or thought patterns, and theconscious mind reads or observes them into holographic illusions that we take tobe the ‘real’, ‘solid’ world. This is why ‘physical’ reality needs an observerto make it manifest Image [../Images/00023.jpg]Figure 18: If we could see the ‘world’ before the decoding process, it would bea mass of wave patterns – thought fields and frequencies. The ‘physical’ worldonly ‘exists’ in our heads/minds when the frequency fields have been decodedinto holographic reality, much like a television transforms frequencies intopictures on the screen The body-computer is doing something similar when it decodes the sea offrequency fields in this dimension into holographic images in our brain (Figures17 and 18, overleaf). The cutting-edge of science, in the realms of quantumphysics, has long understood that the physical world is illusory after exploringreality at levels deeper than the atom – hence the term ‘subatomic’. What theydiscovered in these realms caused them to rewrite the old theories about thereality we thought we lived in. They found that subatomic particles, likeelectrons, could manifest as either a particle (‘physical’) or a wave(non-’physical’) and move back and forth between the two. Light, gamma rays,radio waves and X-rays etc., can also ‘change’ form or ‘shapeshift’ in this way.Scientists use the term quantum (plural quanta) to describe this state ofneither one nor the other. They are both waves and particles at the same time.Think of the ocean and the white crest of the waves as they crash on the shore.The ocean and the crest may look very different, but they are the same water.The difference between a particle and waveform is only the way the samefrequency field is being decoded by the observer. Scientists, remember, areobserving their experiments through the body-computer ‘lens’ like everyone else.The waveform of energy is the frequency field, and the particle form is thebrain decoding the wave or frequency field into a holographic image that looksthree-dimensional. Quite simply, what we call atoms and particles only existwhen the brain has decoded frequency fields into holograms. Atoms are actuallyelectrical fields – vortices – and in response to thought and imagination theyform energy patterns or matrices that we decode into apparently ‘physical’objects. These ‘physical’ objects are actually illusory holograms. Karl Pribram,a neurophysiologist at Stanford University, is one of the pre-eminent proponentsof the holographic view of ‘physical reality’ and author Michael Talbot presentshis view very clearly in The Holographic Universe:> … [Karl] Pribram [realised] that the objective world does not exist, at least> not in the way we are accustomed to believing. What is ‘out there’ is a vast> ocean of waves and frequencies, and reality looks concrete to us only because> our brains are able to take this holographic blur and convert it into sticks> and stones and other familiar objects that make up our world … > … In other words, the smoothness of a piece of fine china and the feel of> beach sand beneath our feet are really just elaborate versions of the phantom> limb syndrome [when amputees ‘feel’ a limb long after it has been removed]. > According to Pribram, this does not mean there aren’t china cups and grains of> beach sand out there. It simply means that a china cup has two very different> aspects to its reality. When it is filtered through the lens of our brains it> manifests as a cup. But if we could get rid of our lenses, we’d experience it> as an interference pattern. Which is real and which is illusion? ‘Both are> real to me,’ says Pribram, ‘or, if you want to say, neither of them are real’. It doesn’t matter how ‘solid’ something appears to be, such as a wall, it isstill vibrating energy that has the illusion of solidity. The slower the energyis vibrating, the denser it appears in the decoding process; the faster itvibrates the less solid it seems to be in 3D reality. There’s a point where theenergy is vibrating so quickly that it goes beyond the frequency range of humansight and ‘disappears’. All it has done is vibrate to a speed that human sightcannot decode, and this is what happens when people claim to have seen a ‘UFO’or ‘alien’ appear and disappear. They came into the frequency range of humansight and then left. To the observer that means: now you see it, now you don’t.Michael Talbot gives a wonderful example of what I am saying about illusoryreality when he tells the story in The Holographic Universe of a stage hypnotistat a party that his father had organised. The hypnotist was putting people intoa trance-state as part of the entertainment and he told a guest, called Tom,that when he returned to a waking state he would not be able to see his owndaughter. The hypnotist then stood the girl right in front of her father andclicked his fingers, or whatever they do. Tom ‘woke up’ and was asked if hecould see his daughter – who was standing inches from his eyes. No, he said, shewasn’t there. The hypnotist put his hand in the small of the girl’s back andasked Tom if he could see what he was holding, even though the girl was in theway. Yes, said Tom, he was holding a watch. Could he read the inscription on it?Tom peered forward and did so while his daughter was standing ‘solidly’ betweenhim and the watch. To the reality pedalled by mainstream ‘science’, that isimpossible, but it isn’t. The hypnotist had implanted the deep subconsciousbelief into Tom’s brain/mind that his daughter was not in the room, and that hadtricked the brain’s decoding system into ignoring the energy field that was hisdaughter’s body and not ‘reading’ it. The ‘physical’ scene in the room onlyexisted in Tom’s brain and, if his daughter’s energy field was not ‘read’, shewould not appear in the holographic ‘movie’ his brain was constructing. Thereare so many energy fields that our brains do not decode and, even within‘physical’ reality, there are so many things that we don’t see because ourbrains choose not to ‘read’ them. The reason for this comes down to belief. Ifthe brain is programmed with a certain sense of reality (your daughter is not inthe room) it will decode reality to fit the belief. This is how those who knowhow we create reality can manipulate what we see and don’t see, and this is alsowhy they have fought so hard and ruthlessly to suppress this informationthroughout what we call ‘history’. In Figures 19, 20, and 21 are three simpleexamples of the way our brain does not decode what is actually there.Image [../Images/00024.jpg]Figure 19: All the lines in this image are straight, but the way it isstructured means the brain cannot accurately decode what it sees. As a result,we see wavy lines because that is all that the brain can construct Image [../Images/00025.jpg]Figure 20: Most people will read this as ‘a bird in the bush’. If you have, lookagain and you’ll see the word ‘the’ is written twice. The brain usually ignoresone ‘the’, because it knows what this phrase is supposed to say. The sameprinciple applies when the brain is programmed to believe something. It will seeonly what supports the belief in what is ‘real’ Image [../Images/00026.jpg]Figure 21: This is clearly a still image. It’s just that your brain doesn’tthink so! Just look at it for a minute Incidentally, one of the amazing characteristics of a hologram is that everypart of the hologram is a smaller version of the whole. If you cut theinterference patterns on the holographic print into four pieces and point thelaser at each one you will not get four parts of the whole picture projectedholographically, you will get quarter-sized versions of the whole picture. Thishappens no matter how small you go and it is the reason why alternative healingmethods like reflexology, acupuncture and others have identified how parts ofthe body, such as feet, hands, eyes and ears have points that represent theorgans, and others parts of the body, which can be used to treat problems inthose areas (Figures 22 and 23). Each cell is a smaller version of the wholebody, which is why a body can be grown from a single cell; and cells are said tohave their own version of the brain. All this has to be the case when the bodyis a hologram. It is the same principle with things like palm reading – with thehand being a smaller representation of the whole body. ‘Modern’ medicine doesnot understand what the body is, let alone how it works, and the medicalindustry therefore creates mayhem in human health, as I will explore. I cameacross this Internet description of the every-part-is-a-smaller-whole principleof holograms:> This is possible because during holographic recording, each point on the> hologram’s surface is affected by light waves reflected from all points in the> scene, rather than from just one point. It’s as if, during recording, each> point on the hologram’s surface were an eye that could record everything it> sees in any direction. After the hologram has been recorded, looking at a> point in that hologram is like looking ‘through’ one of those eyes. > To demonstrate this concept, you could cut out and look at a small section of> a recorded hologram; from the same distance you see less than before, but you> can still see the entire scene by shifting your viewpoint laterally or by> going very near to the hologram, the same way you could look outside in any> direction from a small window in your house. What you lose is the ability to> see the objects from many directions, as you are forced to stay behind the> small window. That is exactly what we do through the body-computer. We see reality through a‘small window’ while Infinite Awareness can see from all directions. Therefore,the two perspectives are fundamentally different. The leading manipulators thatI am exposing in this book, the ‘Shadow People’, have advanced knowledge ofholographic principles and the body-computer and can thus deceive us byimplanting a manufactured holographic reality.Image [../Images/00027.jpg]Figure 22: The hologram at work: Every part of the eye represents a differentpart of the body because it’s a hologram and every part is a smaller version ofthe whole Image [../Images/00028.jpg]Figure 23: The same can be found in the colon and every other organ and regionof the body The Holographic InternetAnother obvious question comes from all this: If we are creating our ownholographic reality in our brains – how come we all see the same basiclandscape? Surely we would all create very different scenes to each other. Yes,we would, but there are two main levels to this: what we see as the backdrop toour lives (street scenes, forests, oceans, stars, planets) and how we perceiveand influence that backdrop. We may all see the same car passing by (backdrop),but we have different views about what we think of the car and whether we wouldlike to drive it (how we perceive and influence the backdrop). The basiclandscape – backdrop, ‘movie set’, collective reality – is produced by what Icall the Holographic Internet. It doesn’t matter if you access the World WideWeb from a computer in China, America, Europe or South Africa – you areconnecting with the same collective reality: the Internet. You can choose to goto different websites and come to different conclusions about what you think ofthem, but the collective reality is the same. Our body-computers are tuned to afar more sophisticated frequency network, or a ‘Cosmos’ Wide Web, which I referto as the ‘Matrix’. It is this that gives us our collective reality. It is justlike the wireless Internet connections that are becoming more and more commontoday. I have a laptop computer and when I am at a location that has a wirelessconnection I can access the Internet without any wires or plug-ins. The computerpicks up the Internet from unseen frequency fields in the atmosphere and ourbrain/DNA computer system is doing the same. The 95 per cent of ‘junk DNA’ andthe 95 per cent or so of our brains that we are told we don’t use, are involvedin this process. Our body-computers are decoding the ‘Matrix’ web into illusoryholographic ‘3D’ reality in the same way that my laptop accesses the wirelessInternet from an unseen frequency in the atmosphere and decodes it intomathematical codes that appear as websites, pictures and graphics (Figures 24and 25).Image [../Images/00029.jpg]Figure 24: Our DNA and genetic structure is a computer terminal andreceiver/transmitter that connects us to the ‘Holographic Internet’ – ourcollective reality. The wires between the computer-people here are symbolic,because it is a wireless Internet accessed by being tuned to its frequency range Image [../Images/00030.jpg]Figure 25: The body/brain is encoded to access the frequency of the wirelessInternet – the ‘Matrix’ – for this reality. Once we leave the body-computer at‘death’, we cease to be tuned to this frequency range and, therefore, we ‘leave’this ‘world’ Crystal antennaDNA is a crystalline substance with a shape that makes it a perfectreceiver-transmitter. As one Internet article pointed out, the wound doublehelix makes it an excellent electromagnetic antenna; the elongated shape makesit a blade antenna for electrical signals; and the ring form ensures it is ahighly efficient magnetic antenna. DNA is also crystalline and that makes it aneven more powerful receiver, transmitter and amplifier of the frequencies or‘light’ that connect to the Cosmic Internet – the Matrix. Crystal is afundamental part of ‘physical’ form. The membrane of every human cell is aliquid crystal and, depending on who you ask, we have between 50 and 75 trillionof them. Bruce Lipton, a research scientist and former medical school professor,produced a detailed study of the cell membrane in his book, Biology of Belief.He concluded that ‘the membrane is a liquid crystal semiconductor with gates andchannels’. Semiconductors are excellent conductors of electricity and can alsobe used as insulators. They are found in electrical devices from computers,digital audio players and cell phones, and they are at the heart ofmicroprocessor chips and transistors. Anything that is computerised or usesradio waves depends on semiconductors and here we have a semiconductorliquid-crystal membrane encasing every cell! The principle component ofsemiconductors used in our electronics and chips is the silicon crystal, hencethe term ‘Silicon Valley’ in California and the ‘silicon economy’. Shortly afterLipton realised that the cell membrane is a ‘liquid crystal semiconductor withgates and channels’, he picked up a book to see computer chips defined as ‘ ...a crystal semiconductor with gates and channels’. He writes:> I spent several more intense seconds comparing and contrasting biomembranes> with silicon semiconductors. I was momentarily stunned when I realised that> the identical nature of their definitions was not a coincidence. The cell> membrane was indeed a structural and functional equivalent ... of a silicon> chip. Precisely. The cells are, in part, the hard drive of the body-computer with thecrystalline DNA holding the genetic memory. The cell membrane’s ‘gates andchannels’ are used to allow into the cell what is needed and block what would bedetrimental, and this is done by electrical impulses. If this process isshort-circuited by electrical and chemical disturbance from the environment andwhat we eat and drink, the gates and channels can malfunction and open up tointruders with all that means for our health and wellbeing (Figure 26). Our ownthoughts, emotions and stress can also cause the process to become flawedbecause they manifest electrically, and these are major reasons why what we eat,drink, think, feel and experience electromagnetically can cause dis-ease likecancer. Which is what? Cellular malfunction. Our bodies are basically crystalsand the Earth is also awash with them. The planet, too, operates in basicallythe same way as the human body – everything does because it’s the sameholographic computer program. The Matrix itself, the ‘Super Hologram’ as I callit, also operates on the same principles, as it has to. Holograms are alwaysmade up of smaller of versions of themselves. Quartz crystals are one of themost abundant of all minerals and appear in every grain of sand, in quartziteand granite, and they are found in nearly every type of rock. Quartz is used inradios, televisions, watches, sonar, radar and other electrical devices and ithas the ability to generate a fixed frequency and convert vibration into anelectrical signal – just like the five senses do. We are walking, talkingcrystalline transmitter-receivers of monumental advancement and proportionsright down to the heart of every cell. The body hologram is decoding frequencieson a staggering scale every fraction of a second, as we perceive ‘time’, andmost of this is happening on a non-conscious level. The brain is estimated toreceive 400 billion items of information every second, but we are conscious ofjust 2,000 or so. Imagine what the rest of the DNA/cellular computer network isprocessing. We take the conscious mind to be ‘who we are’ when it is an almostinfinitesmial fraction of who we are – even at the level of the body alone.Incidentally, the body is a processor of electrical information and what is afirst class conductor of electricity? Water. What does some 70 per cent of thebody consist of? Water.Image [../Images/00031.jpg]Figure 26: The crystalline cell membrane has gates and channels that open andclose in line with electrical impulses. If this process gets out of sync, theyopen and close at the wrong time and the cells can be polluted by poisons andother substances that lead to disease Image [../Images/00032.jpg]Figure 27: This is symbolically the way we experience ‘physical’ reality. It isa gigantic virtual reality game that we have been manipulated to believe is‘real’ Ask me who or what created this Holographic Internet – ‘the world in our heads’– and I will say that I don’t know, at least not yet, but anyone tuned to theMatrix has the potential to change and influence it. When I connect my laptop tothe Internet, I can influence its reality by posting information and it caninfluence me when I read the information that others have posted. This ishappening constantly with the Matrix as we add our perceptions to the ‘wirelessweb’ and it feeds us the collective reality. We can choose to be prisoners ofthis body-computer–Matrix interaction, a passive onlooker and programmed pawn,or we can express our uniqueness through the influence of Infinite Awareness and‘post’ another version of reality on this cosmic computer-game. For that is whatwe are experiencing in this ‘world’ – a version of a computer game, virtualreality (Figure 27). The key to controlling the game is the control of belief,as I have already indicated. What we choose to believe, or are manipulated tobelieve, decides the way the body-computer decodes what we call ‘reality’.Preconceived ideas and rigid belief are the guards at the gates to InfiniteAwareness, because it is not only the ‘gates and channels’ in the cells thatopen and close; so do our gates and channels to Infinite Awareness through thechakra system and even to greater parts of the Matrix. If too many of thosechakra channels are closed or diminished by what we rightly call a closed mind –closed awareness – we will live in a prison of perception (Figure 28). This iswhat the manipulators have done to humanity, as I shall expose in detail.Imprisoned by beliefWhat you can’t believe, you can’t conceive. Belief is a reality filter thatallows into perceived experience only that which confirms the belief … thepreconceived idea. You can observe this clearly in daily life. I have seentelevision documentaries in which people with fixed preconceived ideas abouteach other have been filmed in conversation. They were then questionedindividually about what the other person said, and how they said it, before theoriginal conversation was played to them both. Invariably they were shocked tosee that what they thought the person said, and how they said it, was not whatactually happened. There is a simple explanation for this. Experiments andresearch have shown that the brain edits reality according to its belief. Up toand sometimes more than 50 per cent of the information the brain receives, evenon the conscious level, is edited to fit the preconceived idea. It takes outinformation that is there, and adds things that aren’t there, to construct areality/experience to fit the belief. In the example of that televisionprogramme, the two people in conversation had rigid beliefs about each other,and so, when one of them spoke, the other did not hear what they actually saidand how they said it. They heard what their programmed belief had constructed.We are doing this all the time as we interact with the Matrix and each other.Preconceived ideas and beliefs are mind programs – nothing less.Image [../Images/00033.jpg]Figure 28: The brain has the potential to connect us with many other realitiesthrough the 95 per cent of DNA that is called ‘junk’ because scientists don’tknow what it does. If we have closed minds we create barriers – firewalls – toblock this potential and we become isolated in five-sense reality A skilled hypnotist can implant the belief that someone standing in front of youisn’t there, as we have seen, and there is no limit to how we can be manipulatedif we don’t know how it all works while others do. You can activate ‘parentalcontrols’ on your computer to stop children accessing certain websites. Incountries like China they have a similar system for everyone to prevent thepopulation seeing information which is at odds with the government’s imposeddogma and lies. What the authorities in China are doing is blocking access codesto limit what those computers can perceive on the Internet, and our access tothe ‘Matrix’ Internet is being blocked in the same way. We are being manipulatedto close our gates and channels to that which the Hidden Hand does not want usto know. We are only being allowed to see what the manipulators want us to see;but we can become conscious and override that. I have no doubt that large partsof our brains have been locked off so that we can only perceive a limited rangeof what there is to see and know, even within ‘five-sense’ reality. I will cometo this in more detail later, but the manipulation of belief is at the heart ofit and so is the manipulation of fear which is like a computer virus that closesdown communication channels faster than anything. We talk about people being‘frozen with fear’ and that happens on many levels, not just the physical. Itcloses down chakra channels to ‘out there’ and increases the density of ourenergy fields. This obviously disconnects us from the higher vibrationalenergies of higher perception. Belief and fear (the most powerful form ofbelief) creates the energetic ‘eggshells’ I have talked about for years thathold us in five-sense ‘awareness’ (Figure 29).Image [../Images/00034.jpg]Figure 29: The energetic ‘auric’ eggshells of fear and rigid belief thatdisconnect the droplet from the ocean – Infinite Awareness – and keep us in‘body consciousness’ This is why those in the shadows who seek to control world events are after yourmind – your belief. They pretty much don’t care what rigid belief you have –religious, political, whatever – so long as you have one. Any of them will limityour ability to see the big picture, and they can also play belief againstbelief to divide and rule. Open minds that can open the gates and channels andexpand to consciously connect with Infinite Awareness are their worst nightmare,and they structure society to do all they can to suppress such an awakening,such an opening. Rigid belief can even be seen in the way the neurons connect inthe brain. They form an electrical web that represents the rigidity ofperception, and the neurons fire in accordance with the sequence that representsthe belief. David Shainberg, an American psychiatrist from the William AlansonWhite Institute of Psychiatry in New York, says that thoughts are vortices ofenergy that can become fixed and rigid. These vortices are another level of theprocess that connect with the neuron networks and create the rigid, repeatingsequence in how they fire. Shainberg suggests that these fixed, dense vorticesreveal themselves as fixed opinions, a rigid sense of reality and unchangingviews. It also goes the other way with fixed opinions and beliefs creating thedense vortices and fixed neuron networks. It is these networks andlow-vibrational energy fields (different expressions of the same beliefs) thatclose the channels, hold us in five-sense reality and block the consciousconnection to Infinite Awareness. They are the electrical and vibrational levelsof the filtering process where information is constructed by the brain to fitbelief. It means that some people see the glass half full and others see it halfempty; some see the positive in everything and others the negative. When webreak out of such rigid thought, the neuron web snaps and another is formed tomatch the new reality. With that, the filtering process changes and other fieldsof possibility are decoded that were not being accessed before. We experiencethis as ‘life-changing’ events or a sudden surge of new opportunity in our livesthat never happened before. That ‘opportunity’ was always there in the mass ofenergy within All Possibility; it was just that the person’s belief was causingtheir brain not to ‘read’ it and bring it into holographic reality as a‘physical’ experience. Rigid thought and low-vibrational states, especiallyfear, cause our energy fields to fall into slow-vibrational density and thiscreates a ‘firewall’ to Infinite Awareness. What do we call people who aren’tvery ‘bright’? We call them ‘dense’.Image [../Images/00035.jpg]Figure 30: The staggering effect of thought and words on water crystals. Thecrystal on the left formed after water was exposed to words of ‘love andappreciation’. With the crystal on the right, the words were ‘You make me sick –I will kill you’. It is devastating confirmation of the effect on the world andour bodies of thought, emotion and words (For more examples see the books, Messages from the Water, volumes one and two,by Masaru Emoto.) If you want confirmation of how thought affects energy look no further thanFigure 30. Japanese researcher, Masaru Emoto, of the I.H.M.-Institute in Tokyo,has revealed how water is fundamentally affected by words, thoughts and emotions– all of which are waveforms. He and his team exposed water to various music anddifferent words and expressions, and then froze it to produce water crystals.When these were examined under a microscope the response of the water wasamazing. Look at the way it reacted to the words and thoughts (vibrations) of‘Love and appreciation’, and, ‘You make me sick – I will kill you’. Imagine theeffect on the body hologram of our words and deeds when it is some 70 per centwater (this figure varies by age and weight). This is how thoughts and wordsaffect us energetically. I should stress that it is not the words that have theeffect, but the intent behind them. If you said ‘I will kill you’ in alight-hearted fashion, as a bit of fun, it would not have the same effect as itwould if you meant it, or said it with malevolence.I have described Infinite Awareness as All Possibility and that’s exactly whatit is. There is nothing that cannot manifest within the infinite consciousnessfield that is the Infinite All. The limitations of the Matrix ‘Internet’ (andour brains connected to the Matrix) are simply the limitations of what we chooseto decode into holographic experience, or what we are blocked from doing bymanipulation of the Matrix and our own perceptions. We are now sitting orstanding within All Possibility, and we are All Possibility. However, we aredecoding only a fraction of it, and, therefore, we can perceive life in terms oflimitation and ‘I can’t’. Notice how those who ‘go for it’, who say ‘I can’,tend to achieve what they want, while the ‘I can’t’ and ‘It happens to others’mentality does not. The only difference between the two is the level of AllPossibility that each one is choosing to decode – to ‘let in’. The mentality of‘I can’t’ will decode the fields within All Possibility that manifest as ‘Idon’t’; and the mentality of ‘I can’ will decode the fields that manifest as ‘Ido’. In fact, many who speak about how to consciously create our own realitytell people to perceive only in the ‘present’ and instead of saying ‘I will’ dothis or that, say ‘I am’ doing it. This may sound strange, but I can see thesense of it when what we decode from All Possibility literally matches thebelief. So ‘I will’ can decode fields that represent what we see as ‘the future’and what you want to achieve can therefore always be just out of reach ‘in thefuture’. It is like sitting on a carousel and no matter how fast you go younever get closer to the horse in front. It’s much more powerful to perceive yourambition as happening in the NOW because time is an illusion anyway, as I willcome to shortly. To perceive in the NOW allows it to manifest in the NOW.Computer ‘cultures’When people talk of themselves as being British, American, Chinese, Arab or Jewthey are identifying with their computer – not Infinite Awareness. These labelsof race, nationality and religious identity are computer programs inherited fromothers in the genetic (software/hard drive) ‘bloodline’, and growing up amongthe same believers further downloads the agreed belief. People can, and do,introduce Infinite Awareness to reject this programming and go their own way ofperception, but even then you find some still feel guilty at taking anotherpath. One explanation for this is that the program they have resisted continuesto run in the background. What we call ‘races’ are different computer software,and so is being ‘human’. We are not human, we are Infinite Awareness and AllPossibility. It is the computer program that makes us think we are ‘human’ or‘alien’ or whatever label we use. For ‘human’ read ‘Packard Bell’ and for an‘alien race’, read ‘Mac’ or ‘Dell’ and so on. What we know as ‘cultures’ areactually cultural ‘programs’ inherited and perpetuated by being born into thatprogram. Experience of other cultures starts to rewrite the program and sosocieties change with the generations the more they have access to otherinformation ‘software’. Closed societies change the slowest for that reason. Weare seeing increasing conflict between the parents and children of families thathave come to Britain from the Islamic and Hindu cultures because the parentswant them to follow the original cultural program, like arranged marriages,while the children are being attracted to the western ‘culture’. The more‘western’ information and interaction is downloaded – the more the culturalsoftware will be rewritten in succeeding generations. I stress again thatBritish, American, Muslim, Jew or Hindu is not what we are; it is what ourInfinite Awareness is experiencing. There is nothing wrong with living a programand enjoying ‘being’ someone or other, so long as we don’t confuse this with whowe are. That’s when the trouble starts and the cell door slams … literally thecell door or gate.Image [../Images/00036.jpg]Figure 31: The ‘Hundredth Monkey Syndrome’ is a manifestation of the ‘speciesInternet’ in which those with the same DNA frequency codes can unconsciouslycommunicate information. When we learn something ‘new’, we post it on this‘Internet’ and it becomes available for anyone else who tunes into it. When theydo, they ‘know’ something instinctively that another has had to ‘learn’ The Matrix, the ‘Super Hologram’, is information that’s decoded into theillusory ‘world’ we think we are experiencing, just as a computer reads softwareand the wireless Internet. The information we are decoding from the Matrix is aready-to-wear world and belief-system broadcast to the DNA/cellular network asfrequencies, and decoded into holographic 3D collective reality. Unless webecome conscious, the Matrix acts like a voice telling us what to believe isreal – much like the way the queen in ant and termite colonies broadcasts afrequency that the workers pick up and respond to in their behaviour.Extraordinary numbers of ants can work as one unit amid apparent chaos andcomplexity, because they are picking up their orders or instructions from thequeen in the form of a vibrational blueprint. You can hide the queen from theworkers and nothing will change. Only when the queen dies does everything stop,because the frequency broadcast has stopped. It has also been found thatcolonies quite close to each other will accept ants moving between them, unlessthey travel a certain distance from the colony. Then other ants will attackthem, because they have travelled beyond the range of their queen’s frequency.Ants can distinguish between those encoded with different frequencies or, tothem, ‘friends or foes’. This can also apply to much human behaviour betweendifferent ‘races’ or vibrational codes. Each ‘race’ or animal species isbroadcasting a specific wavelength in line with their DNA codes and they cancommunicate with each other with great efficiency this way. It has beendiscovered that when a number of animals are taught something new, those of thesame species begin to do the same without being shown how or seeing it done.They have picked up this information from the ‘species Internet’ and thisprocess has become known as the Hundredth Monkey Syndrome after the observationof monkeys doing this very thing. Humans do the same, although the manipulationof society and the collective mind have made people less sensitive to thiscommunication system (Figure 31).The mathematical MatrixOn one level, the Matrix is a digital/mathematical construct. In the Matrixmovies they look at computer screens full of moving green codes, but they seestreet scenes and people, and our Matrix works in the same way. You can see themathematical codes of the Matrix ‘Internet’ in the recurring numbers and mathsin nature. Galileo Galilei, the 16th/17th century Italian physicist, astronomer,astrologer and philosopher, said:> [The universe] cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become> familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in> mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other> geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to> comprehend a single word. Well, on its mathematical level, anyway. Scientists and researchers haveidentified recurring mathematical codes like the Fibonacci number sequence whichinvolves adding the last two numbers to get the next one, as in 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,8, 13, 21 and so on. The sequence can be found throughout nature in everythingfrom the proportions of the human body to the way plants grow (Figures 32 and33). Other mathematical and geometrical codes and recurring sequences includethose known as Pi, Phi, ‘sacred geometry’, numerology, the Chinese I Ching,astrology and many others. The discovery of the Fibonacci number sequence isoften attributed to the 12th/13th century Italian mathematician, LeonardoFibonacci, or Leonardo of Pisa, but it was known in India and almost certainlyother ancient cultures at least hundreds of years earlier. The ancients knewabout so much that has since been ‘discovered’, in truth re-discovered. Theserecurring number sequences and proportions connect with each other as theFibonacci numbers connect with the Phi ‘golden number’ of 1.618 (plus many more,but let’s keep it simple). This is also known as the ‘golden ratio’ and ‘divineproportion’ and is found throughout the human body in the proportions of hands,face, even teeth. Some say it can be identified in body temperature and theresting human heartbeat and it can certainly be seen in the proportions ofanimals, sea life, insects and … DNA. The ancients knew about these mathematicalconstants and you find the same numbers and proportions in the pyramids ofEgypt, the Greek Parthenon and endless other structures. The ancient Greekphilosopher, Plato, believed the golden ratio to be the most binding of allmathematical relationships and a key to the physics of the cosmos.Image [../Images/00037.jpg]Figure 32: The way flowers grow reflects the Fibonacci number system … Image [../Images/00038.jpg]Figure 33: … so does the way shells form … Many artists used it in their paintings and sculptures, including Leonardo daVinci in works like The Last Supper. Researcher William Neil identifies otherrecurring numbers in his book, How We Were Made. He found that the ancientSumerian system based on the number 60 and its derivatives constantly recurswith regard to humans, planets, ancient structures like Stonehenge, themeasurement of ‘time’, snowflakes and much more. He also found that hisrepeating number sequences included 360, 3600 and 6 x 6 x 6 (216). The biblicalBook of Revelation says: ‘Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding countthe number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Sixhundred threescore and six’. Neil found that the precession of the equinoxesalso fitted with these sequences. This ‘precession’ is caused by the fact thatthe Earth not only rotates on its axis, but also wobbles. This wobbling motioncreates a circular movement that takes just under 26,000 years to complete the360 degree circuit. The ‘heavens’ through which it ‘moves’ have been dividedinto twelve sections which correspond to a sign of the Zodiac, hence we talkabout moving from the Age of Taurus into the Age of Aries or the ‘new’ Age ofAquarius. All these recurring numbers, proportions and sequences are themathematics of the digital Matrix, the virtual-reality computer ‘game’. What wecall ‘astrology’ is part of the vibrational/mathematical construct and inskilled hands can read future trends, but it is still the trends of the Matrix,the computer program. Infinite Awareness doesn’t have a star sign; thebody-computer does. Everything can be expressed as numbers within the Matrix,and Stephen Marquardt, an American doctor who has studied Fibonacci and Phisequences with regard to the human face, correctly concluded: ‘All life isbiology. All biology is physiology. All physiology is chemistry. All chemistryis physics. All physics is math[s]’. He could have added that all maths isenergy and all energy is consciousness.It is through the manipulation of numbers, language and symbols that the humanbody-computer is encoded with the false reality, the false or ‘dark’ Matrix. Thefake digital construct is held together by number systems and codes, and humanbody-computers are constantly programmed to tune into that manufactured ‘world’– very much like the reality depicted in the Matrix movies. All ‘physical’ lifeforms, and ‘systems’ like politics, finance, commerce and religion, are digitalsoftware programs that we are encoded to sync with. Computers are programmed bywhat they call ‘computer language’ and the same applies to Matrix reality. It isconstructed from the computer language of numbers, symbols and words, all ofwhich represent vibrational codes. Put your hand near your mouth when you speakand you can feel the vibrations of the words, and our language has beenvibrationally constructed to hold us in fake reality. For this reason, the soundof a word is more important to the manipulators than its exact spelling,although the shape (symbols) of the letters are also highly significant in this.Satanists, who have among their number some of the world’s most famous people,use chants, numbers and colours in their rituals to manipulate reality in thesame way. The force behind the fake Matrix has taken energy, or ‘light’, andbroken it up into constituent parts – male and female, positive and negativeetc. – to construct the false reality that we daily experience. In short, thereis the Matrix and there is the even more limited ‘substitute Matrix’ that hasbeen constructed to control us. You might think of the Matrix as the Internetand the ‘subsitute Matrix’ as the Internet the Chinese are allowed to use withall its limits, firewalls and encoded no-go areas. By opening ourselves toInfinite Awareness we change the frequency at which we are broadcasting on alllevels and the power and limitations of the fake construct start to diminish asits vibrational field unravels.The time illusionOne of the limiting principles of the Matrix is ‘time’ because there actually isno ‘time’ – it’s an illusion. When people go into deep meditation, and otherstates of consciousness where they tap into Infinite Awareness, they talk ofhaving a sense of ‘no time’. There is no past or future, only the Infinite NOW,although there are many tricks that lead us to believe that time exists like theapparent passing of events and the aging of the body. They are not expressionsof ‘time’; they are computer software passing through their cycles. When we tapinto our intuition or ‘knowing’, we ‘know’ in the instant we know. There is nosequence of thinking and working it out that eventually leads to intuitiveinspiration. Working something out is an expression of the illusory ‘time’construct while intuition comes in the moment – the NOW – when we need it,because it comes from the realms of no-time. How can we age when there is notime? We can’t. We can only experience the illusion of aging when that iswritten into the Matrix software and our consciousness falls for it. A hologramprojected by a laser from an interference pattern never ages, yet our bodies –also holograms – go through a predictable cycle of young to old, birth to death.The difference is that one hologram is programmed to age and the other is not. Ihave met many recovering mind-slaves from government mind-control operations whowere denied watches, and any awareness of ‘time’, as part of their programming.While this was going on, they only aged fractionally compared with people ofsimilar years. Their DNA/cellular system was not so connected to the illusion oftime, which leads to a belief in aging and an experience to match.I read an interesting article in the magazine, New Scientist, about thedevelopment of what are called quantum gravity computers that operate onenergetic levels deeper than the ‘physical’ atom. The limitless potential ofsuch computers would be that they are beyond the ‘laws’ of five-sense realityand outside our perception of ‘time’. As the article said of such computers: ‘…It is evitable that we are going to have trouble with notions of cause andeffect: the logic of tock following tick or output following input just won’tapply in the quantum-gravity universe’. Time is part of the perception-constructof five-sense reality, and so is cause and effect, also known as ‘karma’. I havemade the point in previous books that ‘karma’ – the idea that what you give outyou get back – applies only in the vibrational/mathematical construct offive-sense reality. Once you consciously operate in the realms of AllPossibility, there are no ‘laws’. The ‘law of karma’ that you get back what yougive out is only one possibility; so it cannot exist as a rigid ‘law’ within AllPossibility. I know some people will ask how we can ‘learn’ unless we face theconsequences of our actions, but All Possibility – Infinite Awareness – is not a‘we’, or an ‘our’. It is an ‘I’. At these levels of Awareness everything is One,and how can Everything That Is face karma for actions it has taken that affecteditself? Take a simple example. You hit someone with baseball bat and the perfect‘karma’ would be for someone to hit you with a baseball bat. But, all that’sreally happening is that Oneness is getting hit twice, because it is both thegiver and receiver. This is why the idea of karma is a constructed, not‘natural’ law. I had to smile reading the New Scientist article as it ponderedon reality possibilities that have been in my books, and others, for years.These were learned scientists at famous universities, while I left school at 15toplay professional football. You don’t need to pass endless exams to understandthe nature of reality. You only have to open your mind to connect with a greaterlevel of Awareness, or knowing, and anyone can do it, because anyone, andeveryone, is that Awareness.Image [../Images/00039.jpg]Figure 34: ‘Past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ on DVD. All are happening at the same‘time’ in (symbolically) different parts of the same ‘disk’ and what happens inone ‘scene’ can affect all the rest. Thus, the ‘past’ can change the ‘future’and the ‘future’ can change the ‘past’ Your life on DVDPeople talk about the power of mind over matter, but to rewrite the aging ‘time’software we need to have the power of consciousness over mind – higher awarenessover DNA program. That’s the way to change all the programs. The Matrix issymbolically like a DVD movie, which is, appropriately, read by a laser – justlike a hologram. The movie is already complete when you put it in the DVDplayer. Past, present and future are all there from the start and operate in thesame ‘NOW’. As the laser runs across the disc the scenes in the movie that youhave watched become the ‘past’ to your reality; the ‘present’ is the scene youare consciously watching; and the ‘future’ is the scenes that you have yet tosee. But the whole movie exists at the same ‘time’ (Figure 34). Your perceptionof ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ come only from the part of the movie youchoose to give your attention to. Spin it back a few scenes and you can giveyour attention to the ‘past’ and experience the equivalent of ‘time’ travel; oryou can spin forward and see the ‘future’. You are not ‘going’ anywhere; it isonly that your focus of attention has changed. So it is with the Matrix. As youmove your attention, you appear to be moving through ‘time’– but you are not.‘Past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ are different parts of the same program and theyare all happening in the same NOW. What we call ‘history’ has not disappeared;it is still happening at the same ‘time’ that you are reading this, and‘history’ can be changed just as software can be rewritten. A holographic‘photograph’ can have many different interference patterns on the same print andeach can be picked out by changing the angle at which the laser strikes. Theillusion of moving through ‘time’ is a bit like that, as you change the angle atwhich you ‘see’ your reality. I have also read, and been told, of manyexperiences where people have seen something, such as a building, and yet whenthey return, even hours or sometimes minutes later, it has disappeared. They hadsomehow accessed a different part of the program. A sense of ‘time’ is basedmerely on the observer’s perspective. As Einstein pointed out, when you areenjoying something ‘time flies’, and when you are in the dentist’s chair itappears to ‘pass’ slowly. When you panic, time seems to pass very quickly, butnot so when you stay calm. The very fact that time is relative to the observermeans there is no time. It is a perception and not ‘real’. Our manufacturedofficial ‘time’ is linked to the Earth’s rotation and when that changes so doesour ‘time’. In America, you can drive across a state border and be in adifferent hour and when you fly across the International Date Line you areinstantly in a different day. Time is an illusion, and if we get attached to itat a deep level of reality it can make it harder to connect consciously withInfinite Awareness, which is a state of no time. Once again, we can work withhuman ‘time’ so long as we know it’s an illusion. Believing it to be real iswhat attaches us to it and we are now in a period when gathering numbers areawakening from the illusion that ‘time’ represents. As Eckhart Tolle, author ofThe Power of Now, wrote:> The time-bound mode of consciousness is deeply embedded in the human psyche.> But what we are doing here is part of a profound transformation that is taking> place in the collective consciousness of the planet and beyond: the awakening> of consciousness from the dream of matter, form and separation. The ending of> time. The sense of moving is another illusion, because it’s all going on in our brain.If you play one of those virtual-reality car-racing games you are just sittingthere while the track is moving. The Matrix is like that, also. Sometimes I gointo states of consciousness where I see the world moving in my mind while mybody goes nowhere, and during these experiences the virtual-reality game is soclear. There is a story of two monks debating about the movement of a flag inthe wind. ‘The flag is moving’, said one. ‘No, the wind is moving’, said theother. A third, passing by and hearing the conversation, said: ‘The flag is notmoving. The wind is not moving. Your mind is moving’. In movies like The Matrixand The Thirteenth Floor, people are ‘plugged in’ to illusory realities throughtheir brains while they are sitting in a chair or lying on a table withoutmoving. It’s the same principle with our reality. Here’s another cracker … thereis no ‘space’ either. Scientists can’t understand why subatomic particles cancommunicate instantly with each other over staggering ‘distances’. They arethinking in terms of space when there is no space involved. It is like thedroplet of water and the ocean. There are no particles, plural, except in theway we perceive them in the illusion. All particles are the same One. They don’thave to communicate between each other when there is no ‘each other’; and theydon’t move from one place to another because there is no space and so there canbe no ‘places’. Appropriately, the word ‘Utopia’ means ‘no place’ – beyond theillusion of time and space. As the old song goes: ‘You’re everywhere andnowhere, baby, that’s where you’re at’. The Super Hologram appears to occupyspace, and we talk of the vastness of space, but it’s a hologram and so thatcannot be. If there’s no space how come we seem to travel through it? Onceagain, that is the illusion our body-computer decodes for us and we ‘travelthrough space’ only as electrical signals interpreted by the brain. Infinity anda pinhead are actually the same because all is One – the ocean. The poet WilliamBlake captured this truth about time and space magnificently when he wrote:> To see a World in a Grain of Sand> And a Heaven in a Wild Flower> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand> And Eternity in an hour When all this becomes your reality there are no more ‘absolutes’, limitations ordogma, only … all possibility. Your attention can be experiencing onepossibility, but at the same ‘no-time’, in the same NOW, you are AllPossibility. You are ‘here’ and ‘there’. You are everything and nothing. You areeverywhere and nowhere. You are and you’re not. You will and you won’t. You canand you can’t. It is and it isn’t. And you are every possibility in between. Onenear-death experiencer described what he saw once the filter of human perceptionwas lifted. He talked of seeing the ‘panoramic view of life’:> ... everything from the beginning, my birth, my ancestors, my children, my> wife, everything comes together simultaneously. I saw everything about me, and> about everyone who was around me. I saw everything they were thinking now,> what they thought then, what was happening before, what was happening now.> There is no time, there is no sequence of events, no such thing as limitation,> of distance, of period, of time, of place. I could be anywhere I wanted to be> simultaneously. These are all the things I have been emphasising in my books over the years. Themanipulation of this ‘world’ has encoded us with a sense of limitation and time(‘limited’ time, as we perceive it). These are illusions designed to ensnare usand hypnotise us into the amnesia of limited perception. Those who have ‘died’and then returned to tell the tale make a highly significant contribution tobreaching the walls of suppression. They have seen what we are not supposed toknow exists. When people say ‘it can’t be done’ they are really saying ‘I don’tbelieve it can be done’. Everything can be done, but to unleash that limitlesspotential we have to clear our minds from a sense of limitation. It is the senseof ‘I can’t’ that becomes the experience of ‘I don’t’.Multiple InternetsIn the same space that our wireless Matrix ‘Internet’ is broadcasting, there areendless other Internets or ‘television channels’ on different wavelengths. Moreenlightened scientists call them ‘parallel universes’ and these are allpotential ‘homes’ when our Awareness withdraws from the body-computer at what wecall ‘death’. As the connection with the computer is broken, so is theconnection with this frequency level of the wireless Internet or Matrix becausewe experience it, and attune with it, through the DNA receiver/transmitter. Thisfrees us from this energetic density and much more of our potential is released.Remember how the Dutch cardiologist, Pim van Lommel, who conducted aconsiderable study on near-death experiences, said that at the moment ofillusory death ‘… these people are not only conscious; their consciousness iseven more expansive than ever’. These other Internets where our Awareness can‘go’ after ‘death’ in this reality are other frequency levels of the same Matrixthat we are experiencing – other computer programs. The Matrix has become a trapfor so much Awareness, a vibrational flypaper in which it ‘moves’ betweendifferent levels of the Matrix thinking it is ‘free’. Maybe the Matrix isdesigned to be a trap or maybe some force is just manipulating a benignconstruct. These other ‘Internets’ are some of the wavelengths that psychicstune into when they are contacting the departed, and many of these communicating‘souls’ still appear to believe in their earthly religions and heroes. Theirconsciousness is so imprinted with their experience ‘here’, that they go onbelieving the same old stuff. As I have said many times: death is no cure forignorance. Also, these other wireless Internets are often so close to this oneon the ‘dial’ that they are not much different, except that they are aware thatthere are multiple worlds. Many of these are still a form of ‘physicality’,albeit of a different density. There are Christian ‘after death’ realities andMuslim, Jewish and Hindu realities in which the departed manifest the heavensand hells of their beliefs. It is not only here that belief manifests reality,it is everywhere. When that Awareness – limited Awareness in its perception ofpossibility – returns to this reality it is called ‘reincarnation’. I wouldsuggest that the idea that we have to live many different lives to learn andevolve to ‘perfection’ is nonsense of extreme proportions. We are already AllPossibility – All-Knowing – so what is there to ‘learn’? Instead, we need toremember what we have always known, but have simply forgotten and beenencouraged to forget by those manipulating the Matrix.Holding our attentionIt is all about attention and focus in the end. Imagine an infinite energyfield. We can see everything as a single unified ‘One’, in which case we connectwith Infinite Awareness, at least intellectually. To access the full magnitudeof its limitless potential and knowing you have to become Infinite Awareness inevery wave and particle of being, and the Matrix construct in all its formsmakes that a real challenge. But even intellectual awareness of InfinitePossibility is certainly a start. From that point of observation you can see the‘bigger picture’ and not get caught in rigid, myopic belief-systems. However, ifyour attention is entrapped by rigid belief you create a subworld withinInfinite Awareness in which you see everything through the lens of your belief.All other possibility is shut out by the energy shield, or firewall, that yourbelief creates. This is the ‘eggshell’. Energy flows where attention goes, asthey say, and attention-created subworlds of belief and limitation control allbut a few in this reality. This also happens on other levels of the Matrix. Thebeliefs may be different, often only slightly different, but if they are rigidand unyielding they will close perception to Infinite Awareness. When I watchtelevision psychics at work communicating with departed loved ones, some can beimpressive in that the information they produce could not be known through othermeans. However, these communications consist of messages about whether someoneshould take the job they have been offered, or how the cat is being looked afteror how someone should go and visit Uncle Fred. I have never heard anyone comethrough to say: ‘Hey, it’s all an illusion, all a manipulated game, don’t takeit seriously’. I have never heard a departed Christian, Jew, Muslim or Hinducome through and say to their relatives: ‘Don’t waste your lives following thereligion – it’s all nonsense’. They mostly relate to this world as if it is‘real’, because they are still stuck in the Matrix box. They are just on adifferent vibrational level of it, that’s all. The Matrix movie trilogy wasbrilliant in the way it portrayed an illusory computer-generated reality, but itdepicted life outside the Matrix as the ‘real world’. It’s not like that and Iwould recommend the movie, The Thirteenth Floor, to get a visual feel for what Imean about illusory realities within illusory realities. Those who leave herewith their conscious connection to Infinite Awareness still intact can transporttheir point of observation into higher realms of consciousness, well beyond theillusory matrices and density that sees everything in terms of division andparts. Your attention dictates your vibrational state and whether you make thetransition to higher Awarenesss or stay within the densities of the Matrix‘Internets’. In ancient Egypt, they had a belief that the dead were taken to a‘hall of judgement’ where their heart would be weighed against a single feather.Only if it weighed less than the feather would the ‘deceased’ be taken toOsiris, god of the afterlife. If it weighed more, they believed, they wouldremain in ‘Duat’ or what I would call ‘duality’, the realm of polarity – theMatrix. This Egyptian myth is symbolic of the lighter or denser state of thedeparted one’s energy field and that is governed by their belief and where theirattention is focused. Either way, we all have eternal life and we are in controlof it. We just have to wake up and remember.It is only when a psychic or ‘channel’ can connect with realms of Awarenessbeyond the computer construct, or Matrix, that information can be accessed aboutwhat is really going on. It is the level of Infinite Awareness that is beyondthe illusions of vibration, polarity and ‘form’. This is where everything isexperienced as One and there is no vibration, only stillness. Oneness is what itsays – Oneness. It has no parts or polarities and therefore does not vibrate. Ihave experienced this state, as so many others have. They call it the stillnessof the heart or a state of indescribable peace and bliss. That’s who we reallyare once the veil of division is lifted – peace, bliss, love. As the title of mylast book said: Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion.The stillness of Infinite Awareness is experienced as silence because it hasnothing to say. It doesn’t need the nagging chatterbox of thought and emotion to‘work things out’. It already knows. We will never connect with InfiniteAwareness through words or even thought. We will know it only through silence,which encompasses everything, free from singular attention. Words and thoughtare a focus for attention, and only silence can see all and know all. We live ina world which finds endless ways to fill the silence with irrelevant noise, talkand magnets for attention. This is not by accident, but calculated design.We live in a world of polarity that operates on every level and is expressedthrough division and conflict in areas like religion and politics. Both arevibrational constructs in which the extremes are the polarities between whichthe creation – religion, politics, whatever – can oscillate into form. Thereason you find, for example, that religions and political systems and partiesbehave and operate in basically the same way is because they are polarities andexpressions of the same vibration. Take the example of Communism (left polarity)and Fascism (right polarity). They call themselves different names, but bothinvolve the same centralised control, military dictatorship and concentrationcamps. Between those two polarity extremes you get things like ‘democracy’ and‘liberalism’ on the same political vibration and they, too, are about centralcontrol and dictatorship, with the military, ultimately, available to enforceit. They just hide the dictatorship better because they are further from thepolarities where everything is more stark and obvious. I was in the UK GreenParty, which is supposed to be ‘different’, but their political personnelbehaved just like the other parties because they are plugged in to the samepolitical/vibrational construct.Flytrap realityIn the end, everything is an expression of Infinite Awareness – even that whichdoes not believe in Infinite Awareness. All is consciousness that createsreality through imagination. Belief is a form of imagination at the lowest endof possibility. If you imagine something now in your mind’s eye you will havecreated that in the vibrational realm in which your mind operates. We do this inour dreams when our imagination is free to fly beyond the confines of thebody-computer. Our dreams involve an apparently 3D ‘solid’ reality and whenunpleasant things happen to us in this dreamstate we just wake up. We can fallover a cliff and still not ‘die’. Awareness cannot ‘die’; it can only imaginethat it does. Charles Tart, a professor of psychology at the Davis Campus of theUniversity of California, asked two skilled hypnotists called Anne and Bill tohypnotise each other. He was trying to synchronise their two hypnotic realities,and he managed to do so. The two, both graduate students, found themselvesexperiencing the same ‘place’– a beautiful beach and ocean. They swam together,studied the same crystalline rocks, and ‘talked’ to each other, even though theywere not speaking in this reality, from where Tart was observing them. Theylater recalled that this hypnotic dream was every bit as ‘real’ as theirexperience in their ‘awakened state’, and included five-sense-type sensations,although their hypnotic world was more pliable and less dense than this one.During their experience they often forgot to manifest bodies for themselves andfloated around only as faces and heads. On one occasion when Bill asked Anne totake his hand she had to ‘think’ her own ‘hand’ into ‘existence’. Interestingly,the nearest psychological state to the hypnotic state is the waking state and,in truth, there is no difference between a dream we have in sleep and this dreamwe have when we are ‘awake’, except that we take this one seriously; and what webelieve in, we experience. As the writer Edgar Allan Poe put it: ‘All we see andseem is but a dream within a dream’ … a hologram within a hologram.We have been caught in a mind-prison and the jailer is belief. What we believe,we create and experience. All the laws of physics and ‘science’ are based onlimitation and they are illusions. We are subject to them because we areprogrammed to believe in them, and those in programmed authority constantly tellus to believe in them. What we call ‘miracles’ are simply the ability todisconnect our realities from a belief in these illusory ‘laws’. When they arenot your reality they cannot be your experience. If you walk across hot coalsbelieving you will get burned then you will; but if you remove that belief fromyour reality you can do it and not get burned, as we see with firewalkers. Thereare no miracles; only the suspension of limited belief – the curse that holds usin servitude. I go into greater detail about who we are and the nature ofreality in Tales from the Time Loop and Infinite Love is the Only Truth –Everything Else is Illusion. The knowledge is still circulating outside themainstream and it could not be destroyed despite the best efforts of the force Iwill now begin to uncover. But it has been comprehensively and often viciouslysuppressed for thousands of years in our concept of ‘time’ to keep the people inignorance of who and where they are. Even today, most people have to go insearch of it, or stumble across it when it should be there for all to see. Whyisn’t it taught in the schools and universities, or broadcast on television andradio as a matter of course? Why isn’t this understanding, which would set usfree from the illusions and limitations of matter, at the forefront of‘education’, ‘science’, ‘medicine’ and the media?The answers to these questions we shall now address.

The dream can thenbecome a nightmare. What I am going to expose from this point on is how the‘five-sense’ dream has been hijacked, and how we can free ourselves from itsfakery.Once again, to keep it simple and easy to follow, I will use the language of‘time’ and the concepts we are familiar with, but what I will describe is justone reality that human minds have been locked into. Sharing the same ‘space’ asthis reality is All Possibility and this is one ‘television channel’ within thatinfinite whole. It should also be remembered that time is an illusion of this‘channel’, and ‘history’, or our perception of it, can be changed by thosemanipulating the ‘Matrix’ if they choose to rewrite the program. A few taps onthe symbolic keyboard, a click of the mouse and, hey, we’ve just made anincredible discovery that tells us more about our history! That’s the nature ofillusions – what is ‘real’ and what is not? The answer is that nothing is‘real’, except in our perception of experience. So this is the story of ourexperienced reality, but, because of its illusory nature, there is always somuch more to know.Humans are controlled by their history, or rather by their perception of it. AsGeorge Orwell said in his incredibly prophetic book, 1984: ‘He who controls thepresent, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future’.Control the writing of history and you control the perception of where we havecome from. That, in turn, becomes the coordinate for where we are and, whenprojected forward, it is the perceived starting point for where we need to go.One of the major foundations of the global conspiracy has been to sell people afalse version of history and life, because, from this, all other forms ofcontrol can follow. For instance, only if you accept the official version of9/11 will you accept the fundamental destruction of basic freedoms to ‘fight theterrorists’ that are alleged to have been responsible. When you know that theofficial ‘history’ of September 11th 2001 is a lie, your view of the present andfuture is transformed in an instant. If you believe that we are at thecutting-edge of human ‘evolution’ and knowledge, and that we are ruled by randompeople who come to power through their own efforts, you will see the world todayand the direction we need to go in a certain light. If you know that humanity iscontrolled and manipulated by inter-breeding bloodlines (computers withparticular codes) going back at least thousands of years, and that this genetictribe places its own people, and its dummies, into the positions of power, thenyour view of the present and what needs to be done will be very different.If you control history, you also control what people believe was known inhistory. This is crucial. To control and confuse the population you need tosuppress their understanding of who they are and where they are – the knowledgeknown thousands of years ago and more. By rewriting history you can erase theadvanced knowledge that the ancients had – the understandings I have discussedin the first two chapters – and replace them with a manipulated reality throughthose twin tools of mind programming: ‘science’ and religion. You do this byportraying the ancient world as entirely primitive, and presenting a false storyabout the ‘evolution’ of knowledge to the present day. This instils the lie thatmodern society is at the cutting-edge of understanding, far in advance of theprimitive ‘past’, when, in fact, the most fundamental knowledge about the natureof life and reality has been systematically suppressed and written out ofhistory to keep the people in ignorance and servitude. I have challengedofficial history in great detail in my other books and I am not going to repeatit all here, but it is necessary to outline and summarise the hidden history ifthe events of today are to be put into their sharpest and most relevant focus.I’ll cut straight to the chase, as they say. On one level, at least, humanity isruled by bloodlines produced from the interbreeding between human andextraterrestrial, or inter-dimensional, races. Some of these take a reptilianform, though there are others. Yes, I know this will sound crazy to most people,but if you are prepared to stay with me, and read the detailed background in myother books, the apparently ridiculous will soon become less so. In the end, asthe layers of information unfold, what I am suggesting provides a logicalexplanation for both the contradictions and ‘mysteries’ of the past, and for thecrazy and apparently inexplicable world we live in today. The vast andever-increasing numbers who are now opening their minds to this material aretestament to that. So, after researching the conspiracy since the early 1990sand travelling to more than forty countries in search of the truth, this is thehistory I suggest has been systematically suppressed. For more sources anddetail see The Biggest Secret, Children of the Matrix and Tales from the TimeLoop.Hidden historyBefore 13,000 years ago – maybe less – there was a global society with onelanguage that was founded on advanced knowledge way beyond where we are in thepublic arena today. The language was originally telepathy, not words, becauseminds could communicate directly without need for the ‘middleman’ we calllanguage. Later, a spoken language was developed from which today’s multiplelanguages derive. Virtually every ancient society has its version of the ‘Towerof Babel’ (Babylon) story when ‘God’, or in truth ‘the gods’, insisted thatpeople spoke many different languages to confuse their communication. Theintroduction of language to replace telepathy anchored people far more infive-sense reality, given that words are five-sense phenomena and the multiplelanguages made it impossible to communicate as before. Those who study wordsfrom this perspective can see clear evidence of the original language from whichall others came. My great friend, Credo Mutwa, the Zulu shaman, is one suchperson. He has a love of words and their origins and he can reel off differentwords in different languages with the most extraordinary ease. He told me thatas he travelled the world meeting the native descendants of the ancient peoplesit became so clear that our diversity of language had a single source. Eventhough he is a Zulu from South Africa, he said he could understand about threeof every five words of the Hopi people when he spent time with them in Arizona.It was the same almost wherever he went because of the single origin.Image [../Images/00040.jpg]Figure 35: The idea that a ‘primitive’ people built these incredible wonders ofthe ancient world is utterly ludicrous However, this theme goes further. There are the ‘mystery’ structures builtthousands of years ago all over the world that ‘primitive’ people could neverhave constructed (Figure 35). Some are beyond the capability even of moderntechnology. At Baalbek, north-east of Beirut in the Lebanon, three massivechunks of stone, each weighing 800 tons, were moved at least a third of a mileand positioned high up in a wall. This was done thousands of years BC. Anotherblock nearby weighs 1000 tons – the weight of several jumbo jets. How was thispossible? Official history does not wish to address such questions for fear ofwhere it might lead. In Peru, you have ancient temples and other sites builtwith stones weighing 440 tons, and just across the border at Tiahuanaco inBolivia, blocks weighing 100 tons are connected by metal clamps. The site isdated at some 11,000 years ago. Also in Peru are the mysterious Nazca Linesformed when the ancients scored away the top surface of the land to reveal thewhite subsurface. By this method were created incredible depictions of animals,fish, insects and birds. The images are made with one continuous line and somewere only seen in their entirety after 1939 when people began to fly over theregion because they can only be seen in full at heights of one to two thousandfeet. Rock carvings dating back more than 10,000 years were found during anexpedition to the Marcahuasi plateau north-east of Lima, Peru, and theseincluded sculptures representing people and animals, most of which are notnative to Peru. They included a polar bear, walrus, African lion, penguin and astegosaurus. Dinosaurs were unknown to science until the 1880s and thestegosaurus was not identified until 1901. The knowledge which allowed wonderslike Nazca, Baalbek, the Great Pyramid at Giza, and other amazing creations tobe built with such precision and scale, came from an advancedextraterrestrial/inter-dimensional race, or races, that, in ancient times, livedamong a more primitive general population.As books and television documentaries in recent years have shown, these amazingancient structures, temples, stone circles and standing stones, were not onlylined up precisely with the Sun, Moon and certain star systems – they werealigned just as precisely in relationship to each other all over the planet. Thebuilding techniques and designs were often the same on different sides of theworld, and they used in their geometry and scale the hidden number systems ofPhi, pi, Fibonacci, and the sexagesimal system based on 60 which is detailed inthe book, How We Were Made by William Neil. They also used granite or sandstone– both full of quartz crystal – for their fantastic structures like pyramids,Baalbek, Stonehenge and such like. Enormous granite statues have been found thatmodern chisels, even those especially hardened and sharpened, cannot cut. Howdid the ‘primitive’ ancients carve them? A precisely machined and shaped cube ofmetal was found in the centre of a block of coal in Austria in 1885 and, basedon the age of that coal seam, it must have been made some 300,000 years ago. Apiece of gold thread was found embedded in eight feet of rock in RutherfordMills, England, in 1844, and that rock was estimated to go back 60 millionyears. Electric batteries have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs, andprehistoric animal bones have been discovered with bullets in them. The officialversion of history is baloney. If you go back far enough, societies were notisolated and disconnected. There was a global society controlled by the ‘gods’and representatives of the ‘gods’ – beings that were extremely technologicallyadvanced compared with the mass of humanity, and well ahead of our societytoday; or, at least, ahead of the technology we are allowed to see in the publicarena. As the author and researcher of far ancient history, Colonel JamesChurchward, wrote:> Civilisations have been born and completed and then forgotten again and again.> There is nothing new under the Sun. What is, has been. All that we learn and> discover has existed before; our inventions and discoveries are but> reinventions, re-discoveries. I would say that this is, at least in part, the Time Loop, the DVD, constantlyrepeating. There are endless legends and accounts all over the world that referto a ‘Golden Age’, which was destroyed by cataclysm and the ‘Fall of Man’. Theancient Greek poet, Hesiod, described the world before this ‘fall’:> Man lived like Gods, without vices or passions, vexation or toil. In happy> companionship with divine beings, they passed their days in tranquillity and> joy, living together in perfect equality, united by mutual confidence and> love. The Earth was more beautiful than now and spontaneously yielded an> abundant variety of fruits. Human beings and animals spoke the same language> and conversed with each other [telepathy]. Men were considered mere boys at a> hundred years old. They had none of the infirmities of age to trouble them and> when they passed to regions of superior life, it was in a gentle slumber. That is the world we could be living in today, if it were not for themanipulation I am going to expose, and we will return to such a paradise oncethis reality has been purged of its ignorance.The ‘gods’The advanced knowledge on which this global society was founded came from whatwe would call extraterrestrials – or what I prefer to term inter-dimensionals.They were peoples from the stars (Hesiod’s ‘divine beings’ in that last quote)and at least some were able to move between dimensions, appearing anddisappearing from human sight. Every ancient society has its myths and storiesabout them under different names, and their appearance and abilities ensuredthey were perceived as ‘gods’ by Earth people. In the 1930s, American andAustralian servicemen landed their planes in remote parts of New Guinea to dropsupplies for their troops. The locals, who had never seen a plane, believed theservicemen were gods and they became a focus of religious beliefs. This wouldhave been even more extreme in the ancient world with advanced beings from otherplanets, stars or dimensions, and their flying craft, which were more advancedthan anything flown (at least officially) by today’s military.These ‘gods’ in their various forms – some looking very much like us, some verydifferent – interbred with Earth people to produce the diversity of races thatwe see today and implanted their own genetic codes that connected them to humanbloodlines. I am describing events in five-sense reality, and so the languagewill reflect this, but it is important not to lose sight of the first twochapters because five-sense reality is an illusion that only exists in 3D-formin the brain. When I talk about bloodlines I am actually talking about computersand computer programs carrying the vibrational and mathematical codes of humansand the various ‘gods’. ‘Interbreeding’ is another way of saying ‘downloadinginformation from two DNA hard drives onto another’. There are many ‘human’computer programs that have long been forgotten and many versions of ‘PlanetEarth’ on different frequencies, but I will pick up the story with theinterbreeding between the ‘gods’ and those known as Homo erectus to create Homosapiens. This has been followed by further ‘upgrades’ to produce today’s Homosapiens sapiens. The reptilian race among these ‘gods’, some say from the Dracostar-system (hence ‘draconian’), was a central player in this interbreeding andit would seem that a tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed race of extraterrestrialoriginal, often known by UFO researchers as the ‘Nordics’, were involved aswell, with their genetics (computer software) added to the mix. The Nordics alsooccasionally had red hair and green eyes and, not coincidentally, the rulingbloodlines of today are obsessed with blond-haired, blue-eyed genetics and, to alesser extent, red-haired people. The Zulu shaman, Credo Mutwa, told me that inAfrica the ‘Nordics’ are called the Mzungu and were known to the ancients ofthat continent. He said that when the white Europeans first arrived in SouthAfrica the tribal people thought they were the returning Mzungu, and they calledthem by that name. The first appearance of Homo sapiens, or ‘Knowing man’, iscurrently estimated to be more than 200,000 years ago, and this fits the periodsuggested in ancient accounts of the extraterrestrial breeding programmes, as Iwill come to shortly.Rebecca Cann, Assistant Professor of Genetics at the University of Hawaii,co-authored a study in 1987 in the journal Nature suggesting that all modernhumans are descended from a single mother who lived in Africa about 200,000 BC.The connection, she said, was through the mitochondrial DNA, which passes downthrough the female. This naturally led people to ask if this single mother couldhave been the biblical Eve, who was in the Garden of Eden with Adam and theserpent – symbolic of the reptilian race. Genesis is a rewrite of the farearlier accounts of the Sumerians who lived in what we now call Iraq from around4000 to 2000 BC. The biblical references to ‘God’, singular, have beenmistranslated from words meaning ‘gods’, plural, and these ‘gods’ and ‘sons ofthe gods’ were the extraterrestrial interbreeders. Here are some examples fromthe Book of Genesis and the emphasis is mine:> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; ... So God> created man in His own image, in the image of God created he him; male and> female created he them. – Genesis 1:26-27z > And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good> and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of> life, and eat, and live for ever. – Genesis 3:22 > And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and> daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men> that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose … There> were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of> god came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the> same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. – Genesis 6:1-4 The offspring of these unions between humans and the reptilian race are known inthe biblical texts as the Nefilim, or Nephilim, and these are the bloodlines inpower all over the world today. The modern human race, or Homo sapiens, emergedfar quicker than conventional ‘evolution’ would allow because there was agenetic intervention by these advanced reptilian geneticists. The famedcosmologist, Dr Carl Sagan, discussed humanity’s reptilian origins in his book,The Dragons of Eden, and pointed out how the fossil record reveals a sudden andinexplicable leap in human brain-function that cannot be explained by the claimsof Charles Darwin and his advocates that humans evolved from reptiles, but veryslowly. Under the Darwinist timescale it should have taken 200 million years formammals to first appear, and another five to ten million for them to evolve intohumans, Sagan says. Instead, it happened very quickly in what Sagan describes as‘a major burst of brain evolution’. Stone tools, for example, did not developslowly, but appeared ‘in enormous abundance all at once’. The ancient Book ofEnoch describes how the ‘fallen angels’, especially one it calls ‘Azâzêl’,introduced this knowledge:> And Azâzêl taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and> breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of> working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the> beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring> tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication,> and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways. Semjâzâ taught> enchantments, and root-cuttings, Armârôs the resolving of enchantments,> Barâqîjâl taught astrology, Kôkabêl the constellations, Ezêqêêl the knowledge> of the clouds, Araqiêl the signs of the earth, Shamsiêl the signs of the sun,> and Sariêl the course of the moon. As the human foetus is forming into a baby, it goes through many stages whichconnect with the major evolutionary points in the development of the presentphysical form. These include connections with non-primate mammals, reptiles andfish. There is a point in which the embryo develops gills. It is very much likethose of birds, sheep and pigs until the eighth week when it goes its ownevolutionary way – reads a different software program. Occasionally, the geneticinstructions fail to read the latest script and some babies are born with tails.These are called ‘caudal appendages’ and form in the lower lumbar region. Mostare immediately removed by doctors, but in some poorer countries where suchmedical support is not available there are people who live their whole liveswith tails. Pheromone is the substance secreted and released by animals so theycan be detected by members of the same species. The pheromones in human womenand iguanas are a chemical match. The tale of Adam and Eve is symbolic of whathappened. An ancient Jewish text known as the Haggadah does not describe thereptile in the Garden of Eden as a snake, but as a two-footed serpent that stoodupright and was as tall as a camel. In Jewish lore, Eve is seen as the ancestralmother of the Nefilim and is associated with the Hebrew words meaning ‘life’ and‘snake’. Ancient accounts found at Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945 also say thatAdam and Eve had horny, luminous skin.Some of the ‘star’ races may well have been benevolent, including some that tookreptilian form, but many were not and wars erupted for control of the planet.One race of reptilian entities was especially malevolent and it was thebloodlines that they created in their breeding programmes that became the‘elite’ families that have systematically increased their power and influence tothe point where they control most of the major positions of political, economic,media and military power today. The ‘elite’ royal, aristocratic and ‘money’families are not obsessed with breeding amongst themselves for no reason; theyare seeking to protect their genetic (computer code) connection to the reptilian‘gods’ to keep it ‘pure’. The open-minded end of mainstream science now has toaddress the obvious. A group of researchers at the Human Genome Project say theybelieve that the 97 per cent of non-coding DNA – what is termed ‘junk DNA’ – isthe genetic code of extraterrestrial life forms. Professor Sam Chang, the groupleader, maintains that the overwhelming majority of human DNA is of ‘off-world’origin and the apparently ‘extraterrestrial junk genes’ merely ‘enjoy the ride’with hard-working active genes passed from generation to generation. Aftercomprehensive analysis with the assistance of other scientists, computerprogrammers, mathematicians and other scholars, Professor Chang began toconsider if junk DNA was created by some kind of ‘extraterrestrial programmer’.The alien chunks within human DNA, Professor Chang says, ‘have their own veins,arteries, and immune system that vigorously resists all our anti-cancer drugs’.He continues:> Our hypothesis is that a higher extraterrestrial life form was engaged in> creating new life and planting it on various planets. Earth is just one of> them. Perhaps, after programming, our creators grow us the same way we grow> bacteria in Petri dishes. We can’t know their motives – whether it was a> scientific experiment, or a way of preparing new planets for colonization, or> the long-time ongoing business of seeding life in the universe. Professor Chang speculates that the apparent ‘extraterrestrial programmers’ wereprobably working with ‘one big code’ consisting of ‘several projects’ that haveproduced life forms on various planets. He suggests that perhaps they ‘wrote thebig code, executed it, did not like some function, changed it or added a newone, executed again, made more improvements, tried again and again’. ProfessorChang, who is one of many scientists and researchers to point to humanity’sextraterrestrial origins, says:> What we see in our DNA is a program consisting of two versions, a big code and> basic code. First fact is, the complete ‘program’ was positively not written> on Earth; that is now a verified fact. The second fact is that genes, by> themselves, are not enough to explain evolution; there must be something more> in ‘the game’ … Sooner or later we have to come to grips with the unbelievable> notion that every life on Earth carries genetic code for his extraterrestrial> cousin and that evolution is not what we think it is. This is what I have been saying since 1991, and what Dr Chang’s DNA researchsuggests can also be found in ancient records and accounts all over the world.It is another elephant in the living room that the authorities and concreteminds desperately seek to ignore and dismiss. These extraterrestrial‘geneticists’ were – are – computer programmers who know how at least manylevels of the Matrix operate as vibrational/mathematical constructs. This allowsthem to infuse their computer codes into others and manipulate them through thatvibrational/mathematical connection, as I shall be discussing in more depth alittle later.The ‘Golden Age’ and the Great FloodThe ancients across the world described a high-tech ‘Golden Age’ that wasbrought to an end by enormous cataclysmic events, including a fantastic tidalwave. In its latter period, the age became anything but golden as other forcesmoved in seeking to take over. The various extraterrestrial/inter-dimensional‘gods’ fought their high-tech wars, often in the sky, and these were some of theso-called ‘wars of the gods’ in ancient mythology. Whether these were connectedto the incredible geological upheavals is open for debate, but the fact that theEarth was struck by astonishing events is described by both global folklore andscientific research. A series of geological catastrophes caused colossal earthchanges through earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves on a scale wecould not begin to imagine today. From the biological and geological recordthere appear to have been several enormous upheavals from around 13,000BC. Thisis why every ancient society had its own version of the Great Flood story –extraordinary geological cataclysms did happen thousands of years ago and theydestroyed this ‘Golden Age’ that so many ancient accounts acknowledge. Thesestories continue today in research about pre-Flood, or ‘pre-deluvian’,civilisations known as Atlantis, which is most often said to be located in theAtlantic, and Lemuria, or Mu, in the Pacific (Figure 36). Atlantis and Mu (knownby other names in different cultures) were the two major centres of theonce-global society. The Nordic-type extraterrestrials were based in Atlantisbefore the Flood, and the reptilian race was primarily in Mu or Lemuria. Thebiblical tale of Noah is a later version of the Flood story told thousands ofyears earlier in Sumer, the land we now call Iraq. The Sumerian version tellshow some of the gods, known as the Anunna or Anunnaki, decided to destroyhumanity and one ‘god’, called Enki, warned the priest-king Ziusudra of thecoming flood. He was told to build a great ship and take aboard ‘beasts andbirds’. After the rains and flood, Ziusudra bowed in thanks before the Sun-god,Utu. The same story was told in the later Babylon, also now Iraq, with the‘Noah’ figure given the name, Utnapishtim or Atrahasis. You can also find theFlood story in Egypt, Assyria, Chaldea, Greece, Arcadia, Rome, Scandinavia,Germany, Lithuania, Transylvania, Turkey, Persia, China, New Zealand, Siberia,Burma, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Sumatra, Islam, in Celtic lore and amongnative peoples throughout North, South and Central America, Africa, Asia,Australia and the Pacific. Each society or tribal people may have used differentnames and added their own spin here and there, but they all tell the same basicstory. Some speak of a great heat that boiled the sea; of mountains breathingfire; the disappearance of the Sun and Moon and the darkness that followed; theraining down of blood, ice and rock; the Earth flipping over; the sky falling;the rising and sinking of land; the loss of great continents; the coming of theice; and virtually all of them describe a wall of water which swept across theplanet.Image [../Images/00041.jpg]Figure 36: The approximate locations given for Atlantis and Mu, or Lemuria As you can see in The Biggest Secret, and the excellent book, The Day the EarthNearly Died, by D.S. Allen and J.B. Delair, the ancient accounts are supportedby the geological and biological evidence with the most incrediblesynchronicity. The Azores, which some believe were part of the sunken Atlantis,lie on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which is connected to a fracture line thatcontinues for a distance of 40,000 miles. The Mid- Atlantic Ridge is one of theforemost areas for earthquakes and volcanoes. Four vast tectonic plates: theEurasian, African, North American and Caribbean, all meet and collide in thisregion making it very unstable geologically. The Azores and the Canary Islands(named after dogs ‘canine’, and not canaries) were subject to widespreadvolcanic activity in the time period that the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato(427–347 BC), suggested for the end of Atlantis. In his writings, Timaeus andCritias, Plato appears to date the end of Atlantis at about 11,000 years ago.Tachylite lava disintegrates in seawater within 15,000 years, yet it is stillfound on the seabed around the Azores, confirming geologically-recent upheavals.Other evidence, including beach sand gathered from depths of 10,500 to 18,440feet, reveals that the seabed in this region must have been, againgeologically-recently, above sea level. The oceanographer, Maurice Ewing, wrotein National Geographic: ‘Either the land must have sunk two or three miles, orthe sea must once have been two or three miles lower than now. Either conclusionis startling’. The geological and biological evidence also suggests that thewidespread volcanic activity which caused the sinking of the land in the regionof the Azores, happened at the same time as the break up and sinking of the landmass known as Appalachia, which connected what we now call Europe, NorthAmerica, Iceland and Greenland. Even their degree of submergence appears closelyrelated. Similar evidence can be produced to support the view that the continentknown as Mu or Lemuria now rests on the bed of the Pacific and that the islandsof the Pacific are its remnants.The so-called Bermuda Triangle – between Bermuda, southern Florida, and a pointnear the Antilles – has long been associated with Atlantis. It is also an areasteeped in legends of disappearing ships and aircraft. Submerged buildings,walls, roads and stone circles like Stonehenge, even what appear to be pyramids,have been located near Bimini, under the waters of the Bahama Banks and withinthe ‘triangle’. Some other facts that most people don’t know: the Himalayas,Alps and Andes mountain ranges only reached anything like their present heightaround 11,000 to 13,000 years ago. Lake Titicaca, on the Peru-Bolivia border, istoday said to be the highest navigable lake in the world, at some 12,500 feet.Around 13,000 years ago much of that region was at sea level. Why are so manyfish and other ocean fossils found high up in mountain ranges? Simple: thosemountains were once at sea level – and recently so in geological terms, too.There were also mass extinctions in this same period. Today, there is increasingacceptance that the Earth has suffered some colossal geological upheavals, andwhat happened could have affected the solar system as a whole. Every planetshows evidence of cataclysmic events which have affected either its surface,atmosphere, speed and angle of orbit, or rotation. Plato wrote in his work,Laws, that agriculture began at high elevations after a gigantic flood coveredthe lowlands. The botanist, Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov, studied more than 50,000wild plants collected from around the world and found that they originated inonly eight different areas – all of them mountain terrain. A tidal wave of themagnitude described in ancient accounts would have produced pressures on theEarth’s surface of two tons per square inch, creating mountain ranges andfossilising everything within hours. Artificial stone today is formed bypressures of this magnitude. Intact trees have been found fossilised, and thatwould be impossible unless it had happened in an instant. The tree wouldnormally have disintegrated before it could be fossilised over a long period.The cataclysms caused an instant freezing in some parts of the Earth, hencemammoths have been found embedded in ice still standing up and in the process ofeating.The upheavals of the ancient world destroyed the advanced global society or‘Golden Age’ that existed before, and humanity had to start all over again. Ifyou believe that is far-fetched, think about today’s society. It may be‘advanced’ on one level, with power grids, computer systems and all the rest.Such technology can perform apparently miraculous feats like typing an email andhaving it read by someone on the other side of the world seconds later. But whatwould happen to this technological society if we experienced a globalcatastrophe that devastated the planet? Within minutes, we would be living inthe technological Stone Age. It would be a primitive, everyone-for-themselves,find-your-own-food, shelter and warmth, free-for-all (look what happened afterthe Asian tsunami and the New Orleans flood). As ‘time’ and generations passed,the memory of the technological world we have today would fade, ever morerapidly, and only be preserved in stories and myths which would, more and more,be seen as crazy tales and figments of the imagination. Most people would denysuch a world ever existed when it would be so at odds with their dailyexperience. We would have the same we-can’t-do-it-so-it-can’t-be-done mentalitythat once laughed at the very idea that we could fly into space. The officialhistory in that post-cataclysmic society would only begin with the records leftby humanity once they had re-advanced to a certain level. Only then would theywrite or symbolise accounts of their history, and this would be based on storiespassed verbally through the earlier generations. Such a point could takehundreds, even thousands, of years after the global geological destruction.I am convinced that there was another consequence of these enormous upheavals,maybe even the cause of them, and that was a fall down the frequencies into adenser reality – the ‘Fall of Man’ that is talked about. You have to be verycareful with information that comes through psychics and ‘channels’ who claim toaccess other dimensions. It can be exceptionally accurate or utter toshdepending on the quality of the channel, but I had some explanations channelledfor me in 1990 about what happened at the end of Atlantis that have becomeincreasingly profound the more that I have learned and understood. I will letyou read all of what was said near the end of the book because it is so relevantto what is happening today. But, in the context of where we are now in thisstory, it said this about the closing days of Atlantis:> … there were many energies being used, and information and knowledge being> used, which were for particular reasons of safety withdrawn, shall we say, to> prevent complete catastrophe, to prevent total destruction of your planet. One> could say these were sort of emergency measures, if you like, to prevent the> inhabitants of this planet from an untimely destruction. The more powerful the energies (information) available, the greater potentialfor creation and destruction. It would seem that certain energies that made theadvanced global society possible were withdrawn to stop them being used todestroy everything, and this changed the frequency levels that the humancomputer was able to access. These energies are now returning, which is why somany people are beginning to wake up, but the effect at the end of Atlantis wasto plunge the world into greater density and comparative ignorance.After the Flood …As the Earth began to recover from the catastrophe, peoples who had survived inthe higher elevations began to return to the lowlands. Survivors from Atlantis(‘Nordic’ or ‘Aryan’ bloodlines) and Mu/Lemuria (Reptilian bloodlines) headedfor other lands, as portrayed in Figure 37, and they used their advancedknowledge to found other cultures. It is basically here that conventionalhistory picks up the story of ‘modern’ humanity. Accounts by the Inca people,compiled by Fernando Montesinos, one of the earliest Spanish chroniclers inSouth America, maintain that there were two distinct Inca empires – one beforeand one after devastating land upheavals. Survivors who had sheltered in amountain-top sanctuary, possibly the famous ‘lost city’ of Machu Picchu,returned to Cusco in the Andes to start again, say the accounts. At least someof the survivors who headed for the high lands may have been warned by the‘gods’, as symbolised in the Sumerian/biblical tale of Noah and his ark. Thisreturn after the Flood is a common theme and the most significant of thesestart-again societies was Sumer in Mesopotamia, ‘The Land Between Two Rivers’,which we know as Iraq. The Sumerian period is estimated to have spanned themillennia between 4000 and 2000BC and is called by mainstream ‘historians’ the‘Cradle of Civilisation’. They also say that other independent civilisations ofgreat advancement also suddenly appeared in the same period in Egypt, and theIndus Valley in what is now the Indian continent (Figure 38), and there wereothers even earlier. Sumer was not the start of what is called ‘civilisedsociety’. It was one of the most significant to emerge after the catastrophethat destroyed the ‘Golden Age’. Sumer was not the beginning; it was thestart-over-again which was to become the centre of another vast empire. Afterthe cataclysms, cultures in Egypt and the Indus Valley also ‘suddenly’ andunexplainably manifested at a very high level of development compared with mostother areas of the world. Historians portray them to be independent of Sumer,but, again, they were not. They were part of the same Sumer Empire – see myother books like Tales from the Time Loop and The Biggest Secret for thedetailed background.Image [../Images/00042.jpg]Figure 37: The directions that the people of Atlantis and Mu headed as a resultof the cataclysmic events that literally changed the face of the earth Image [../Images/00043.jpg]Figure 38: Three advanced civilisations that ‘suddenly’ emerged after ‘TheFlood’ Image [../Images/00044.jpg]Figure 39: Sumer, the ‘Land of the Gods’ Some of the ‘gods’ returned, especially the reptilian ones, and advancedknowledge was given to the chosen few in these societies, especially Sumer(Figure 39). The knowledge was passed on through initiation in the Mysteryschools – the forerunners of today’s secret-society network. This influx ofknowledge right at the start explains the mystery of why early civilisationslike Egypt and Sumer (the land of ‘Shinar’ in the Bible) began at the peak oftheir development and then fell into decay, when the normal course of events isto start at a lower level and slowly advance through learning and experience.There was clearly an infusion of highly advanced knowledge that was later lostto most people. For this reason, the earlier pyramids in Egypt were far moreadvanced than later ones. In every culture throughout the world are ancientstories and texts which describe the ‘gods’ who brought advanced knowledge, andthis would again explain the mystery of how the ancients had a phenomenalunderstanding of astronomy and many other sciences. The Sumerians were the firstknown people to study the stars, develop the written word and enforce a legalcode. They were the first people known to use the sexagesimal system of numbersbased on 60, and to divide ‘time’ into 60 seconds and 60 minutes. They alsointroduced the twelve month calendar. The Sumerians were the first knowncivilisation to have codified legal and administrative systems with courts,prisons and written records for government, history, mathematics and astronomy.They established the first schools and intensive farming with wheat, barley andanimals. Basically, all the foundations of what we call ‘modern society’ startedin Sumer and this was the society and structure given to them by the reptilian‘gods’. It was the artefacts, texts and records from Sumer and its successors,like the Assyrians and Babylonians, that were so professionally andsystematically looted or destroyed after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Theseadvanced, ancient, post-deluge societies appeared with tremendous speed after amassive influx of knowledge from the ‘gods’. Professor W.B. Emery writes inArchaic Egypt:> At a period approximately 3400 years (BC), a great change took place in Egypt,> and the country passed rapidly from a state of advanced Neolithic culture with> a complex tribal character to two well-organised monarchies, one comprising> the Delta area and the other the Nile Valley proper. At the same time the art> of writing appears. Monumental architecture and the arts and crafts developed> to an astonishing degree and all the evidence points to the existence of a> well-organised, even luxurious civilisation. All this was achieved within a> comparatively short period of time, for there appears to be little or no> background to these fundamental developments in writing and architecture. The Reptilian ‘gods’The Sumerians left us clear explanations for the source of their knowledge andculture. Their records were discovered thousands of years later, starting in themid-1800s when tens of thousands of clay tablets were found in the former landof Sumer on the site of the Assyrian capital city of Nineveh, near what is todayMosul in Iraq. An Englishman, Sir Austen Henry Layard, made the first discoveryand others followed. The astonishing accounts the tablets contain originated inSumer – not with the later Assyrian culture – and I therefore refer to them asthe Sumerian Tablets. It is estimated that they were buried around 2000 BC, butthey tell a story that goes back some 240,000 years to the lost civilisations ofthe ‘Golden Age’. The Tablets describe planets of the solar system, in bothnumber and environment, in ways that were only confirmed in the 20th century,and they show how advanced some of the ancients really were. In more recenttimes, many books have been written translating the content of the Tablets andyou don’t have to delve into the translations for long to see that much of thebiblical Old Testament is a steal from these Sumerian stories. They tell howKing Sargon was found as a child floating in a basket on the river and wasbrought up by the royal princess who found him – the tale later attributed toMoses. They describe the Great Flood and a place called E.DIN (‘The Abode of theRighteous Ones’). The much later Bible speaks of Eden, the garden of ‘God’. Thestory of Genesis is a summary of the accounts told in the Sumerian Tablets infar more detail. As I mentioned earlier, many of the terms translated into theEnglish version of the Old Testament as ‘God’ come from words that actually mean‘gods’, plural, and the Sumerians said the founders of their civilisation were arace of beings that came to this planet from elsewhere bringing great knowledgeand technology. They called these beings the ‘Anunna’. Their later Semitic namewas AN.UNNAK.KI (‘Those who from Heaven to Earth came’) and DIN.GIR (‘TheRighteous Ones of the Blazing Rockets’). Anunna means ‘Sons of An’ (laterwritten as Anu), the ‘king’ of the Anunna/Anunnaki. The Tablets describe how theAnunnaki, later called ‘gods’, created a culture of great advancement andtechnology that was destroyed by planetary catastrophes and flood. They alsoreveal that the Anunnaki were a reptilian race – as widely confirmed when youread other ancient accounts. A Tablet dating to around 3500 BC leaves us in nodoubt as it describes the arrival of the Anunnaki: ‘The reptiles verilydescend’. The symbol of the Hyksos kings in Egypt, who originated in Sumer, wasthe snake, and Egyptian royalty in general was very much associated withreptilian imagery. Even academics like Dr Arthur David Horn, former Professor ofBiological Anthropology at Colorado State University at Fort Collins, haveconcluded that humanity was seeded by an extraterrestrial race, or races, andthat the Anunnaki were reptilian. He, too, believes that these same reptilianentities have sought to control the world for thousands of years, as he explainsin his book, Humanity’s Extraterrestrial Origins. Today’s ruling families alsouse reptilian and Anunnaki symbolism all the time because they are the Nefilimbloodlines – the result of the interbreeding between humans and the reptilianAnunnaki. The Sumerian Tablets include detailed descriptions of how the Anunnakiinterbred with humans to create a hybrid race, a fusion of the genes (computerprograms) of humans and themselves. The Tablets tell of how the originalbreeding programme was headed by the chief scientist of the Anunnaki, calledEnki, or ‘Lord of the Earth’ (Ki = Earth), and their expert in medicine,Ninkharsag, also known as Ninti (‘Lady Life’). Mesopotamian depictions portrayher holding a horseshoe-shaped tool, used at that time to cut the umbilicalcord. Another name later given to her was Mammi, from which came mama andmother. Mama or Ma as a term for mother can be found in various languages allover the world. Ninkharsag would later be symbolised by the stream of mothergoddess deities with names like Queen Semiramis, Isis, Barati, Artemis, Dianaand the biblical Mary. This is where the virgin mother and child myths originatefrom and portayals of the Reptilian mother and child have been found in gravesof the Ubaid people, who preceded the Sumerians in Mesopotamia (Figure 40).These goddess figures also symbolise much deeper esoteric concepts for those atthat level of understanding.Image [../Images/00045.jpg]Figure 40: Reptilian mother and child figurines were found in graves of theUbaid people who preceded the Sumerians in the same land Image [../Images/00046.jpg]Figure 41: The caduceus double-snake image that symbolises DNA. It is the logofor today’s medical profession The virgin-birth myths of religion come from the creation and seeding ofchildren by the Anunnaki without sexual contact. There are even Sumeriandepictions of the ‘gods’ holding test tubes. After many failures, and somehorrendous creations, the Tablets indicate, Enki and Ninkharsag produced a humanhybrid that the Sumerians called a LU.LU (‘One Who Has Been Mixed’), and thiswould appear to be the biblical ‘Adam’. This was the splicing together of theDNA of the Anunnaki with that of the human form known as Homo erectus. Some ofthese hybrids were designed to rule as the ‘middlemen’ or ‘demigods’ between theAnunnaki and the people. It is evident that the gods of Sumer knew about DNA,both from the accounts and the symbol they used of the intertwining snakes orserpents. It has been passed down through people like the Greeks and Romans withnames like the Caduceus of Mercury, or Hermes, and is used today as a symbol bythe medical profession (Figures 41 and 42). The wings at the top represent whathappens when the energy known as the ‘kundalini’ shoots up the spine and outthrough the crown chakra to connect with Infinite Awareness. Kundalini is aSanskrit word that means ‘coiled up’ or ‘coiling like a snake’ and inunconscious people it pretty much stays like that in the base chakra at thebottom of the spine. Once the mind opens, the kundalini ‘uncoils’ and you can‘fly’, hence the wings. I had a massive kundalini experience in 1991, and whenit happens on that magnitude very heavy boots are recommended. DNA also lookslike a snake when massively magnified (Figure 43, overleaf).Image [../Images/00047.jpg]Figure 42: A bronze depiction of the caduceus by James Muir. Whether meant ornot, it includes all the elements of the Mesopotamian goddess symbolism – theegg, the intertwining snakes of DNA, wings to psychically ‘fly’, and the pointsaround the head that would later inspire the Statue of Liberty What the Bible calls ‘Adam’, the ‘first man’, is likely to be symbolic of ‘theAdam’, a genetic type not an individual. The biblical ‘Eve’ was supposed to havebeen created from a rib of Adam, but the word from which ‘rib’ derived was theSumerian, TI, which means both ‘rib’ and ‘life’ according to the translations ofauthor Zecharia Sitchin. To be created from the ‘life’, or life essence, of theAdamic race makes rather more sense than a rib. In the same way, the ‘dust fromthe ground’, from which the Bible claims that Adam was created, reallytranslates as ‘that which is life’ from the Sumerian term, TI.IT. Appropriately,the Sumerian name for humans was LU, which has the root meaning of ‘worker’ or‘servant’ and also implies a domesticated animal like a sheep. Does that notdescribe the nature of human life today and for a long time past? The reptilianAnunnaki, who I will also refer to as the Reptilians, wanted to create a slaverace to serve their interests by, among many other things, mining gold and otherminerals, especially in Africa, the Sumerian Tablets indicate. Credo Mutwa toldme that many words in Africa with a Sumer origin relate to mining and goingunderground. He said the Bapedi people have the word ‘shuma’, which means to gounderground and mushumo means ‘job’. The Tablets describe how the Anunnaki setout to create slaves, later called Homo sapiens, to serve their agenda. Theytell of how the sperm of Anunnaki males was used to fertilise human eggs beforethey were transplanted to Anunnaki females to be birthed. All this appears tohave first happened hundreds of thousands of years ago, but has continued eversince on various scales. Many of the stories told in the Tablets refer to eventsin Lemuria and Atlantis. All this makes more understandable the countlessstories told today by people claiming to have been abducted by non-humanentities, many described in reptilian terms, which forced them to have sex ortook their eggs or sperm. The babies that result often disappear in earlypregnancy with no medical explanation. There are many ‘abduction’ experiencesthat are simply invented or have other, more earthly, explanations; but todismiss them all, given their number and often consistency of detail around theworld, would be just as ridiculous as believing every word of every one.Abductees report experiences with a variety of non-human entities, tall blondpeople, the classic ‘Greys’, reptilian types and crossbreeds. The Reptilians aredescribed as very tall – seven feet and more – with scaly, green-brown andsometimes almost albino-white skin, with webbed, clawed hands, and golden eyeswith split pupils. Some are reported to have tails and there are clearly manydifferent types, as with humans. These entities are said to have the ability tocontrol the minds of their victims while various procedures, often painful anddistressing, are performed on them.Image [../Images/00048.jpg]Figure 43: The reptilian feel about DNA when massively magnified Image [../Images/00049.jpg]Figure 44: The Reptilian brain, or R-complex, is the oldest part of the humanbrain. It represents the base instincts of survival and produces the charactertraits of cold-blooded behaviour, a desire to control, an obsession withhierarchical structures of power and the idea that might is right, winner takesall Most people don’t realise that we all have considerable reptilian genetics orcomputer programs. The oldest part of the human brain is known by scientists asthe R-complex or ‘reptilian brain’ (Figure 44). It is the most obvious remnantof our reptilian genetic history and has a massive influence over our behaviour.Scientists say that the reptilian brain represents a core of the nervous system,and from this come character traits like aggressive and ritualistic behaviour,territoriality, and a desire for social hierarchies – all traits of the ‘elite’families who manipulate world events to this day. Researcher Skip Largent wrotethis in an Internet article about the R-complex:> At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain. Without> defining them, I shall simply say that in human activities they find> expression in: obsessive compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals and> superstitious acts; slavish conformance to old ways of doing things;> ceremonial re-enactments; obeisance to precedent, as in legal, religious,> cultural, and other matters and all manner of deceptions. This perfectly describes the behaviour of the ruling families which own orcontrol politics, banking, business, the military and the media today; and so itshould because they are human–Reptilian hybrids … the Nefilim. The reptilianbrain is the source of: cold-blooded behaviour which has no empathy with thevictims of your actions; ‘territoriality’ – controlling the world around you; anobsession with hierarchical structures of rule and control; aggression; and theidea that might is right, winner takes all. What you have in those charactertraits of the reptilian brain are the very characteristics displayed by theReptilian hybrids for thousands of years. You could not describe them better.Racism comes from the reptilian brain and the aggressive, violent sex thattoday’s ‘elite’ families indulge in big time – see Father Bush, Dick Cheney, thelate President Gerald Ford and other famous names I expose in my books. TheAnunnaki Reptilians have a fiercely hierarchical power-structure and they haveimposed the same on humans. All the pomp, ceremony and ritual that you see withroyal families, religion and the political establishment comes from theReptilians that seeded the ‘royal’ bloodlines and created the politicalstructure and religion to install their methods of rule and control. Can itreally be a coincidence that the ruling bloodlines today manifest the classictraits of the reptilian brain while, at the same time, the evidence points tothem being Reptilian hybrid bloodlines? The Cosmologist, Carl Sagan, who knewfar more than he was telling, wrote in his book, The Dragons of Eden:> It does no good whatsoever to ignore the reptilian component of human nature,> particularly our ritualistic and hierarchical behaviour. On the contrary, the> model may help us understand what human beings are really about. The common storyThe interbreeding between the ‘gods’ and humans is a constantly repeated themein every part of the world and can be seen in the Old Testament narrative, takenfrom the Sumerian, of the sons of God (properly translated, the sons of thegods) who interbred with humanity and created a hybrid bloodline called theNefilim. The term Nefilim, or Nephilim, can be translated as ‘Those WhoDescended’ or ‘Those Who Fell From The Heavens’. In Hebrew myth, the Nefilim,the ‘sons of the gods’, are called ‘Awwim’, which means devastators or serpents.The American researcher, David Sielaff, emphasises that the Nefilim are not thesons of the gods (beni ha-Elohim), but the offspring of the interbreedingbetween the ‘daughters of men’ and the non-humans the Bible calls the Elohim.The Nefilim were also known in ancient times as the Rephaim, Emim, Zazummim andAnakim, and they were all described as very tall or ‘giant’ people. The biblicalGoliath was a Rephaim and giant in Hebrew is ‘repha’. This theme of giants is aconstant one. Cave paintings found in places like Japan, South America and theSahara Desert, depict giant people with round heads towering over human hunters.Bones of giant people between eight and twelve feet tall have been found inmounds in Minnesota and other locations. Scores of giant red-haired mummies werediscovered in a cave near Lovelock in Nevada and some were seven feet tall. TheDelaware Indians speak of a race of giants who once lived east of theMississippi in enormous cities, and the same descriptions of giants in ancientlegends and accounts can be found everywhere. Credo Mutwa, expert in ancientAfrican lore, tells the same stories from his culture. The Piute Indian legendsabout these giants say they were cannibals. They would even dig up the Piutedead from their graves and eat them, the accounts claim. Stories of Atlantisinclude tales of red-haired giants who acted like vampires, and the giantNefilim were associated with cannibalism and blood drinking – just like theruling bloodlines are today, as I shall be detailing. Of course this must be thecase: the ancient Nefilim and the families who control the ‘modern’ world arethe same genetic tribe or computer program. Most accounts say that the giantswere unfriendly, even hostile, to the rest of the population and they were oftenassociated with strange craft that sound very much like the ‘flying saucers’ ofmodern UFO accounts.Genesis tells us that the sons of the gods married the daughters of men beforethe Flood, as well as afterwards, and Numbers calls the Nefilim, the sons ofAnak, or descendants of the Anakim (Anunnaki). According to scholar and author,Zecharia Sitchin, who has written many books on the Sumerian Tablets, the term‘men of renown’ in the Genesis passage referring to the Nefilim should read,from its Sumerian origin: ‘men of the sky vehicles’. This puts rather adifferent complexion on the whole story and makes a great deal more sense of it.The Genesis reference to ‘heroes of old’ is also relevant. The word ‘hero’ comesfrom the Egyptian term, ‘heru’, which, according to researcher, Wallis Budge,was ‘applied to the king as a representative of the Sun god on Earth’. Theprecise meaning was ‘a human being who was neither a god nor a daemon’ and theterm clearly has the inference of a crossbreed race. The writer Homer (8th-9thcentury BC) wrote that ‘the heroes were exalted above the race of common men’.The poet, Pindar (518-438 BC), used the term, ‘hero/heru’, to describe a race‘between gods and men’. Flavius Josephus, the first century writer andhistorian, said this of the Genesis reference to the interbreeding between‘gods’ and human women:> … for many angels of God accompanied with women and begat sons that proved> unjust, and despisers of all that was good, on account of the confidence they> had in their own strength; for the tradition is, that these men did what> resembled the acts of those whom the Grecians call giants. The term ‘angel’, which means messenger, became associated with these non-humanentities, Reptilian and otherwise. In the Septuagint, the Greek version of theOld Testament, the phrase ‘sons of the gods’ is translated as ‘angelos’ –angels. The name for Sumer in the Tablets is KI.EN.GIR, which has beentranslated as ‘The Land of the Lord of the Blazing Rockets’ and also ‘The Landof the Watchers’. The term ‘Watchers’ is often used to describe ancient ‘gods’,and, today, some people who claim to have been abducted by Reptilians and othernon-human entities say that they have described themselves as ‘watchers’ or‘custodians’. The Egyptian name for their gods, the Neteru, translates literallyas ‘Watchers’. There were said to be good and bad ‘Watchers’ and many weredescribed in reptilian terms. In a Dead Sea Scroll fragment translated by theHebrew scholar, Robert Eisenman, there is a description of a Watcher calledBelial, who is described as the Prince of Darkness and the King of Evil. He issaid to be terrifying in his appearance – like a serpent with ‘a visage like aviper’. One of the main angelic groups in Hebrew lore is the Seraphim or ‘fieryserpents’ and the Watchers are very much connected to the description ofserpents. In the Persian teachings they also talk of a being they describe as‘the old serpent having two feet’, just as the ancient Book of Enoch featureswalking serpents. Many scholars have suggested that the Book of Enoch in itspresent form was written around the second century BC, but it comes from mucholder accounts. The Scottish explorer, James Bruce, located three copies of thebook in 1773, and fragments of ten Enoch manuscripts were found among the DeadSea Scrolls discovered between 1947 and 1956 at Qumran in Israel, where theEssene community are said to have lived 2000 years ago. The text describes Enochas the ‘seventh from Adam’ and recounts events before the Flood. Mostinterestingly, the Book of Enoch describes the fall of the Watchers, the‘angels’ who fathered the Nefilim, and it says that the fallen angels askedEnoch to intercede on their behalf with ‘God’. One of the sections is called theBook of the Watchers. It tells of the interaction between the fallen angels andhumans and how they started to ‘beget’ children’:> And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days> were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the> children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another:> ‘Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us> children’. > And Semjâzâ, who was their leader, said unto them: ‘I fear ye will not indeed> agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great> sin’. And they all answered him and said: ‘Let us all swear an oath, and all> bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this> thing’. > Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon> it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on> the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had> sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. ‘The plan’ they would ‘not abandon’ is still unfolding today, and theinterbreeding is almost certainly the source of the belief in ‘original sin’which says everyone is ‘born a sinner’. The interbreeding produced the Nefilimor Nephilim of Genesis, or what the Book of Enoch calls the Anakim or Anak(giants) – the Anunnaki/human crossbreeds:> And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three> thousand ells. Who consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no> longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And> they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to> devour one another’s flesh, and drink the blood. In the ancient Hebrew text, the Book of Noah, and its derivative, the Book ofEnoch, a strange birth is described of a non-human child, who turns out to beNoah of ‘Great Flood’ fame. References to this also appear in the Dead SeaScrolls which included material from the Book of Enoch. The strange child thetexts describe is the son of Lamech. He is said to be unlike a human being andmore like ‘the children of the angels in heaven’. Lamech’s child, Noah, isdescribed as white-skinned and blond-haired, with eyes that made the whole house‘shine like the Sun’. Reptilian beings with shining eyes and glowing bodies aredescribed by Credo Mutwa in his African accounts, ancient and modern. Thisdescription of the Reptilians having eyes and bodies that ‘shine like the Sun’is one possible origin of the Sun god worship performed by the Reptilian hybridbloodlines since ancient times and continued today by the elite families,although there are multi-levels to Sun worship depending on how high you are inthe hierarchy of knowledge. Blond-haired, blue-eyed beings with laser-like eyesis a description of mysterious people or ‘gods’ which spans thousands of yearsto the present day and appears in cultures across the world. Lamech questionshis wife about the father of the child, Noah:> Behold, I thought then within my heart that conception was [due] to the> Watchers and the Holy Ones … and to the Nephilim … and my heart was troubled> within me because of this child. The bloodlines of ‘Noah’ are reptilian–human hybrids. Many peoples claim theyare descendants from Noah – descendants from the reptilian Watchers andAnunnaki. In the Dead Sea Scrolls, Noah is described as looking like ‘thechildren of the [fallen] angels of heaven’ whose ‘conception was [due] to theWatchers … and to the Nefilim’. The Book of Enoch says that Noah was warnedabout the coming deluge, and instructed by an ‘angel’ (the Anunnaki geneticsexpert Enki according to Mesopotamian accounts) that he must escape and his‘seed preserved for all the generations of the world’. It makes sense that Noah,and his many other aliases in different accounts of the Flood, would be warnedby a Reptilian ‘god’ if he was a Reptilian hybrid. We can also see why thebloodline of ‘Noah’ is considered so important by so many groups, though themasses will have no idea of the real significance. The Book of Enoch was bannedby the Roman Church which sought to deny the earlier Christian belief in theexistence of flesh and blood angels, fallen angels occupying physical bodies andinterbreeding with humans. This was to stop the people understanding the truesituation. Freemasons have always looked upon Enoch as one of their legendaryfounders and the very name ‘Enoch’ means ‘initiated’. The Ethiopian text, theKebra Nagast, is thousands of years old and it refers to the enormous size ofthe babies produced from the sexual or genetic unions between humans and the‘gods’. It tells how: ‘…the daughters of Cain [son of Noah] with whom the angelshad conceived … were unable to bring forth their children, and they died’. Itdescribes how some of these giant babies were delivered by caesarean section: ‘…having split open the bellies of their mothers they came forth by their navels’.In the Shahnemeh, or Book of Kings, the legendary history of Iran completed inAD 1,010 by the Arab poet, Firdowsi, he describes the birth of a baby calledZal, the son of a king called Sam. The king is horrified by the unearthlyappearance of his child who has a very large body ‘as clean as silver’, hair aswhite as an old man’s and ‘like snow’, and a face compared with the Sun. Samcalls his son a demon child, a child of the daevas – the Watchers.Familiar themes across the world …The Egyptians said that the Watchers came in their ‘heavenly boats’, and inancient cultures across the world you have this constantly recurring theme of‘gods’ arriving in some kind of flying machine to found civilisations and bringknowledge and techniques that were light-years ahead of what existed before. Inthe Indian culture they called the flying craft ‘Vimanas’ and there were severaldesigns. Some were cigar-shaped while others were described as double-decked,with a dome and porthole windows. Both types are regularly described in UFOsightings today. The ancient Indian texts describe anti-gravity technology ofthe type used in ‘flying saucers’. So much so that when the Chinese discoveredSanskrit documents in Tibet and sent them to the University of Chandigarh fortranslation, they were found to contain the knowledge to build interstellarspaceships, according to the University’s Dr Ruth Reyna. The documents arethousands of years old. Dr Reyna revealed that these ships were known as‘Astras’ and it was claimed they could fly to any planet. Some texts talk aboutthem flying to the Moon. Details of building, flying, and operating the craftare all included. The Chinese, apparently, even used part of the contents intheir space programme.The accounts in the Sumerian Tablets are supported by Credo Mutwa, the Zulusanusi – the highest level of South African shamanism – and the officialhistorian and storyteller of the Zulu nation. The very name ‘Zulu’ means ‘Peoplefrom the Stars’ and they believe they were seeded by an extraterrestrial ‘royal’race. With no one for Credo to pass on his knowledge, and the urgent need foreveryone to know the astonishing information he has received in a lifetime ofinitiations, I produced DVDs with him called The Reptilian Agenda. They run formore than six hours and that is still only a fraction of the knowledge hecarries. He reveals what he once pledged in his initiations never to reveal,but, he says, the situation for humanity is so perilous that it is far moreimportant for them to know what is going on than for him to keep such vows ofsilence. The information went underground when the Europeans invaded Africa, andtheir Reptilian hybrid colonial leaders, in Credo’s words, ‘milked the minds ofthe shamans and then killed them’. It was suicide to talk openly of such things,and secret networks of initiation were formed to keep it alive. Credo tells thesame familiar story of the interbreeding between the extraterrestrial Anunnakiand humans to produce a hybrid race. He has artefacts like the ‘Necklace of theMysteries’, which supports this account. It is an extremely heavy copper‘necklace’ that actually rests on the shoulders and it has been mentioned inrecords 500 years old. Credo says it goes back at least a thousand years, andthe large symbols that hang from the necklace tell the story of humanity. Inpride of place at the front are an extraterrestrial with a big copper willy, andan Earth woman into whom the ET ‘fits’ (Figure 45). This is symbolic, Credoexplains, of the union between the people from the stars and the people of theplanet. You find the same theme recorded in virtually every ancient culture.Significantly, he says, the copper willy was once made of gold before it wasstolen and replaced with copper. This mirrors the ancient Egyptian story aboutthe golden penis of their god, Osiris, which is symbolised by the secretsocieties today – especially the Freemasons – as an obelisk. The way theextraterrestrial is portrayed on the necklace, Credo says, is merely symbolicbecause these ‘gods’ were of a very distinct and non-human form (reptilian) andthey warned the people of instant death if they ever depicted them as theyreally looked. How often we can observe in religious texts the theme that God(the gods) must not be seen or revealed, nor his (their) name ever spoken. Thusthe ‘gods’ were portrayed as obviously not human, but not as they really looked,although you do find some more literal representations here and there as withthe Ubaid example earlier.Image [../Images/00050.jpg]Figure 45: Credo Mutwa’s ‘Necklace of the Mysteries’ with an earth womanalongside a symbolic ‘extraterrestrial’ with a big willy. This portrays theinterbreeding of the Reptilians and human women – a constant theme throughoutthe ancient world. The image of the ‘ET’ is symbolic because the legends say theReptilians forbade the people to portray them as they really are Image [../Images/00051.jpg]Figure 46: The hand of symbols attached to a classic flying saucer. Credo Mutwasays that, according to ancient legend, the Reptilians arrived in these craftfrom much bigger ‘motherships’ that orbited the earth Hanging from the Necklace of the Mysteries is a large hand, full of symbols.Among these is the All-Seeing-Eye, which symbolises, Credo says, the ‘Watchers’;there is also the constellation of Orion, which modern researchers haveconstantly connected with extraterrestrial activity on Earth; and there is a‘Star of David’, so associated with ‘King David’ and Judaism, but really asymbol used all over the ancient world. As some Jewish historians have stated,it is a symbol found everywhere and only became associated with the Jewish faithwhen the Rothschilds – the Reptilian banking dynasty – began to use it in the18th century. The Necklace of the Mysteries includes a very clear ‘flyingsaucer’ which, the legend says, the extraterrestrials used to fly from theirgiant ‘Mothership’ to land on the Earth (Figure 46). They say the Mothershipcontinued to orbit and it was to here that the leaders sheltered during theupheavals of the Great Flood. This is exactly what the Sumerian Tablets say. InFrance, cave paintings dated to between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago include ovaland disc-shaped objects standing on tripod legs with ladders coming down fromthem. A drawing carved in a cliff at Fergana in central Asia depicted a man whoappeared to be wearing an ‘airtight helmet’ with some mechanical device on hisback. It was dated to 7000 BC. Whatever the origin and nature of ‘flyingsaucers’, and other such craft, they have been seen and recorded for thousandsof years. Credo has painted pictures from ancient and modern descriptions ofthese Reptilian entities (Figure 47), and he describes the various levels of thefiercely imposed genetic hierarchy. The lower levels are the ‘warriors’, thehive-mind guys. They operate very much like ants picking up instructionsbroadcast by the ‘Queen’ and act accordingly. The Reptilians and their hybridbloodlines are seeking to do the same with humans, and with so many they havesucceeded. Other Reptilian entities, as typically described, can be seen inFigures 48 and 49 (overleaf). They are ruled by the ‘royal’ leaders, which havehorns and tails, Credo says, and at the very top are beings with a white,albino-like skin and not the greenish or brownish colour of the others. Theseare often referred to by researchers as the ‘Draco’. Witnesses and abducteeshave reported seeing Reptilian beings with albino-like skin and thesedescriptions can also be found in ancient texts. While I was writing this book,I saw an Internet documentary in which former US Navy Yeoman, Thomas ColmanSheppard, told of seeing photographs of a non-human entity in a top-secret filein a classified vault at White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa, Japan. Hedescribed its skin as like that of a white snake, and I have heard similardescriptions many times. You can see his interview in the UFO activity archiveat www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com]. The reptilian–human connectionis also symbolised in statues and other artwork around the world (Figure 50).Image [../Images/00052.jpg]Figure 47: A ‘worker’ Reptilian’ painted by Credo Mutwa Image [../Images/00053.jpg]Figure 48: Another Reptilian type described by many people who claim they havebeen abducted by reptilian entities.

This is so close to the Central American term forthem: ‘People of the Serpent’. Africa, like every other continent, is full oflegends about the serpent race. In 2006, archaeologist Sheila Coulson of theUniversity of Oslo in Norway published evidence of python worship 70,000 yearsago, and it is the earliest human ritual yet discovered. She found the evidencein the Tsodilo Hills in South Africa’s Kalahari Desert, an isolated cluster ofsmall peaks with the world’s largest concentration of rock paintings. Theancient San people, also known as Bushmen, hold these hills to be sacred andthey are known as the ‘Mountains of the Gods’ and the ‘Rock that Whispers’. Sanmythology says that humans descended from the python. Credo Mutwa told me thelegend about the ‘Great Serpent’ and the giant god, Matsieng, which means ‘Lordof the Locusts’, who, it is said, came to the Earth in the Tsodilo Hills tocreate human beings. He said that the Venda people in the Northern Transvaalworship serpents who they believe brought ‘enlightenment’ to their people andtaught them to have sex. Still today, they have snake dances to represent thepython. They and other Africa tribes symbolised the Milky Way as a snake withthe stars as its scales and Credo says that all over Africa the legends of theserpent gods abound. The ancient African word, ‘Seme’, which relates to greetinga superior, also means great snake or reptile. Credo talks for hours on theDVDs, The Reptilian Agenda, about the background and history of the Chitauri. Hedescribes how the Earth was once encircled by a canopy of water vapour (the‘firmament’) that was destroyed in a cataclysm. This water vapour protected theplanet from the harsh effects of the Sun, and the whole planet was moist andhumid and had a constant temperature. It was a place of enormous abundance andenormous forests. This is a common description of the pre-cataclysmic ‘GoldenAge’ or the ‘Garden of Eden’. But Credo says that when the Chitauri destroyedthis canopy (symbolised by the biblical forty days and forty nights of rain) thewhole climate changed as the Sun’s rays baked once-green and abundant lands,like Egypt, and began to form the deserts. Scientists agree that Egypt, now partof the Sahara Desert, was once a green and pleasant land.The knowledge monopolyThe Reptilian hybrid bloodlines, or computer programs, expanded out of Sumer andbegan the process of monopolising advanced knowledge about the nature of realityand withdrawing it from wider circulation. They established ‘Mystery schools’ topass it on only to the chosen few, and infiltrated others which had a morebenevolent purpose. Eventually, most of these were taken over by the Reptilianhybrids who used this knowledge to manipulate human perception and impose uponthe world their hierarchical form of government and control. They sought andcontinue to seek nothing less than a global dictatorship. An organisation calledthe Royal Court of the Dragon (also known as The Brotherhood of the Snake) wasformed in Egypt to infiltrate the royal and religious centres of power there,especially the Mystery schools. Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonic historian,describes what happened in Egypt, and what he calls the ‘black magicians ofAtlantis’ are the Reptilian bloodlines who also targeted and infiltratedAtlantis in the same way before the Flood, and caused the most powerful energiesto be withdrawn to prevent destruction of the planet. The Reptilians were basedlargely in Mu or Lemuria, but there were many attempts to infiltrate theAtlantean society of the Nordic race using their black magicians. Hall writes:> While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil,> there arose from its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or black> magic, [in Egypt] … the black magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise> their superhuman powers until they had completely undermined and corrupted the> morals of the primitive Mysteries … they usurped the position formerly> occupied by the initiates, and seized the reigns of spiritual government. > Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralysed the intellectual> and spiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete and> unhesitating acquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priest craft. The> Pharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council – a committee of> arch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood. This is what happened wherever the Reptilian hybrids were located and theyimposed the political, economic and religious structures that still rule theworld today. The structure of administration, the foundation of law, buildingtechniques, and so many other features of what we call modern society, can betraced back to this ancient race that founded Sumer and expanded their empire toEgypt, India, Greece, Crete and much further afield where their knowledge wasbehind the great monoliths, temples and other legendary structures. ProfessorW.B. Emery said in his book Archaic Egypt that the country had passed rapidlyfrom a state of advanced Neolithic culture with a complex tribal character, totwo well-organised monarchies. The whole concept of royalty and aristocracy isthe creation of the Reptilian bloodlines, which are obsessed with ritual andhierarchy in line with their genetic computer program. The hybrids became the‘royal’ bloodlines that were placed in positions of power to rule on behalf oftheir creators and masters. The Reptilians repeated this pattern all over theworld before and after the Flood, and thus Reptilian gods have been worshippedand feared in places like Central and South America, India, China, Japan, SouthAfrica and many other regions.The serpent kings and queensIn the late 19th century, Colonel James Churchward, an ardent researcher intothe existence of Mu or Lemuria, says he was shown some ancient tablets in thesecret vault of a monastery in northern India. They told the story of how theNaacals or Naga Mayas (‘serpents’) from the continent of Lemuria-Mu hadtravelled to India via Burma to establish a colony there. Churchward put thetexts together in years of painstaking work and revealed how they described thedestruction of Mu, the ‘Motherland’, and how the Naga Mayas or Nagas hadtravelled to India. The Vedic scholar, David Frawley, explains how the ancientHindu holy books, the Vedas, reveal that the earliest royal bloodlines of India,the priest-kings, descend from the Bhrigus, who arrived from a place across thesea. The Bhrigus were an order of adepts initiated into the ancient knowledge.Frawley says in his book, Gods, Sages, and Kings: Vedic Secrets of AncientCivilization, that the monarchs of these bloodlines included the ‘Serpent King’Nahusha. They expanded into the five tribes that populated a large part of theIndian population. James Churchward wrote a number of books on the civilisationof Mu and he says the Nagas also populated China, Tibet and parts of Asia. InIndia, the Buddhist text, the Mahauyutpatti, lists eighty kings who descendedfrom the Nagas or ‘Serpent Kings’. Hindu legend says that the Nagas can movebetween human or reptilian form at will. This is what we call shapeshifting. Theserpent ‘sea’ or ‘fish’ gods of Sumer and Babylon were said to be able to changeshape and look human whenever they chose. These ‘fish gods’ were anotherdescription of the Anunnaki Reptilians. Shapeshifting is a common theme which Iam going to discuss in more detail later. Across India, the rulers claimed powerbecause they descended from the Nagas, who were described as offspring from theinterbreeding of humans with the serpent gods. Accounts in the Indian epics alsorefer to how the reptilian Nagas intermingled with white peoples (the Sumerians)and although their relationship was often one of conflict and distrust, the twointerbred, the epics report, to produce a reptilian–mammal hybrid that became …the Aryan kings (Sum-arian kings). The Naga Maya people, with their mothergoddess religion (the Reptilian religion), were also the origin of the Mayapeople of Mexico. Researcher Michael Mott writes in Caverns, Cauldrons, andConcealed Creatures:> The Nagas are described as a very advanced race or species, with a> highly-developed technology. They also harbor a disdain for human beings, whom> they are said to abduct, torture, interbreed with, and even to eat. The> interbreeding has supposedly led to a wide variety of forms, ranging from> completely reptilian to nearly-human in appearance. Among their many devices> are ‘death rays’ and ‘vimana’, or flying, disc-shaped aerial craft. These> craft are described at length in many ancient Vedic texts, including the> Bhagavad-Gita and the Ramayana. The Naga race is related to another underworld> race, the Hindu demons, or Rakshasas. They also possess, as individuals,> ‘magical stones’, or a ‘third eye’ in the middle of their brows, known to many> students of eastern mysticism today as a focal point for one of the higher> chakras, or energy channel-points, of the human(oid) nervous system – the> chakra associated with ‘inner visions’, intuition, and other esoteric> concepts. The Chinese emperors were the same and they claimed that their descendence fromthe ‘serpent gods’ gave them a right to rule. They were known as Lung or Dragonsand many of the earliest emperors were depicted with reptilian features, verymuch like the Nagas. They were described as part human, part serpent. One ofthem, called Huang Ti, was said to have been born with a ‘dragon-likecountenance’. It was claimed that he was conceived by a ray of golden light thatentered his mother’s womb from the Big Dipper constellation (the usual ‘virginbirth’ story so associated with Reptilian interbreeding). The Big Dipperincludes the star Alpha Draconis, the star of the Egyptian god, Set. AlphaDraconis is an alleged home of Reptilian ‘royalty’, the elite leadership, knownas the ‘Draco’. One Chinese legend says that when he died, Huang Ti transformedinto a non-physical etheric dragon and flew to the realm of the immortals. Onceagain the dragon is symbolic of the reptilian race and, while most prevalent inChina and the East, it is a feature of cultures throughout the world. The kingsof the succession in the Reptilian bloodlines were known as ‘Dragons’. When manykingdoms joined together in battle, or as a group of kingdoms, they appointed a‘king of kings’. These were known as the Great Dragon or … Draco. I found directreferences to this theme in the Indian (formerly Indus Valley) works, like theBook of Dzyan, one of the oldest of Sanskrit accounts, and the epics,Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The Book of Dzyan tells of how a reptilian race itcalls the ‘Sarpa’ or ‘Great Dragons’ came from the skies to bring civilisationto the world. A deluge, the biblical Great Flood, ended the Golden Age, it says,but the serpent gods survived and returned to rule. They are describedsymbolically as having the face of a human and the tail of a dragon. Theirleader was called the Great Dragon and the Ku Klux Klan still uses the term‘Grand Dragon’ today.The Celtic title of Pendragon, as in Uther Pendragon, the father of ‘KingArthur’ in the Grail stories, was also a version of this. Pendragon = ‘GreatDragon’. In the legends, the symbolic Arthur was a descendant of the dragons,and his helmet carried a dragon motif. Merlin, Arthur’s ‘magician’, wasdescribed as only half human as he was the child of an underground being and ahuman woman. The Arthurian stories include all the classic elements of thetheme, including the creation of royal bloodlines through the interbreedingbetween humans and non-human entities, shapeshifting, the use of holographicimages to hide a being’s true form and battles between competing dragons. Thereis also the theme of the ‘Lady of the Lake’ and this connects with the storiesof goddess-worshipping serpent peoples like the Nagas living in undergroundcentres located under lakes and lochs. Like the Celtic myth and folklore, theancient Greek culture was inspired by the Sumerians and Egyptians, and theearlier Atlanteans and Lemurians, and was based almost entirely on their storiesand myths under different names. The influence of the Sumerians can hardly beoverstated and they appear to be the centre of the Reptilian hybrid network thatspanned the world. They travelled in all directions and even the earliestChinese writing was derived from the same cuneiform system of the Sumerians,although this can also be explained by the Reptilian ‘gods’ communicating thesame information in different parts of the world. Whatever the detail, it isclear that throughout the Sumer Empire – which included Egypt, and the IndusValley – the people worshipped serpent gods. The Reverend John Bathhurst Deanewrote in his book, The Worship of the Serpent:> … One of [the] five builders of Thebes [in Egypt] was named after the> serpent-god of the Phoenicians, Ofhion … The first altar erected to Cyclops at> Athens was to ‘Ops’, the serpent deity … The symbolic worship of the serpent> was so common in Greece that Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing> it into the mysteries of all their gods. Dragons, Nagas, Chitauri, Nefilim, Anunnaki. Different names, same bloodlines.The theme of ruling ‘royal’ families and emperors who claim descent and theirright to rule from the ‘serpent gods’, can be found everywhere. These bloodlinesand connections were symbolised by royal emblems in the form of a dragon, snake,sphinx, plumed serpent and the tree-cross, or Ankh. The dragon or serpentcontinues to be a symbol of royal and ‘divine’ heritage in places like Asia. InEgypt, they had an order called the Djedhi (Jedi?) – and the ‘Dj’ meant‘serpent’. Thus we have pharaohs of the serpent line called Djer, Djoser andDjederfra. The Royal Court of the Dragon was established in Egypt in 2170 BCunder Ankhfnkhonsu, and more formally by Queen Sobeknefru in 1783 BC, to providean institution to pursue the work of the ‘Dragon’. The oil still used in theBritish Coronation ritual is symbolic of the ‘Messeh’ fat of the Nile crocodile,used in the Coronation ceremonies for the pharaohs in ancient Egypt. TheEgyptian ceremonial title of Moche means ‘He who is anointed with crocodile fatfrom the Nile River’. From Messeh we get ‘messiah’ – the Jewish legend of thecoming ‘messiah’ – the one anointed with the fat of the crocodile: the newpharaoh. This can be found in Celtic mythology, too, and the image of the Messehbecame a Dragon – the emblem of kingship. In Media (now Turkey), the Iraniansknew their kings as Mar, which means ‘snake’ in Persian. They were called the‘Dragon Dynasty of Media’, or ‘descendants of the dragon’. The earliest of theroyal bloodlines of Central America claimed genetic descent from the serpentgods, Quetzalcoatl and Itzamna. The priest kings of the Peruvian Incas weresymbolised by the snake and they wore bracelets and anklets in the image of asnake. In the Mycenaean age in Greece, the kings were, in the words of authorJane Harrison, ‘regarded as being in some sense a snake’. Cecrops, the firstMycenaean king of Athens, was depicted as a human with a serpent’s tail.Another, Erectheus, who founded the Eleusinian Mystery School, was worshipped asa live snake after his death and, according to legend, King Kadmus of Thebesshapeshifted into a live snake when he died. The Sumerian accounts tell offlying serpents and dragons breathing fire (symbolic of their aerial craft?) andhow the ‘kings of Sumer’, going back long before the deluge to some 240,000 BC,were ‘changelings’, seeded by the union of the gods and humans. Sargon theGreat, that famous ruler of the Sumer/Akkadian Empire, claimed this same geneticorigin. The very existence of ‘kingship’ is reported in the Sumerian Tablets tohave been a gift of these gods. Equally clear is that they were reptilian gods.Stewart’s story …The same theme, though from a very different source, is described by theAmerican author, Stewart Swerdlow, who discovered the truth during his years inthe infamous mind-control and genetics programmes at Montauk on Long Island, NewYork. As a youngster, Stewart was kidnapped at night (with his mother’sknowledge) by what he thought were extraterrestrials and taken to Montauk. Helater learned that his kidnappers were military officials posing as ETs – thisis a common ruse to hide the truth of who is doing the abducting. He was forcedinto the Montauk genetic and mind-control programme and he says he found outmuch later that he was among only one per cent who got out alive. During hisyears under government-military control, Stewart says that he learned about theagenda for global domination and the non-human entities behind it all. Theseentities, he writes, are reptilian. He says he saw reptilian beings at Montaukand they ‘seemed to pop in and out of physical reality’. Stewart tells the storyin his book, Blue Blood, True Blood. He says that many and variousextraterrestrial groups have come to this planet and seeded the different races.Atlantis was dominated by a white or Caucasian people called the Atlans, hesays, who were from the star system known as Lyrae – or Lyra – while a reptilianrace was located on Mu or Lemuria in the Pacific. The original Lyrians were notphysical as we understand that word, but they became trapped in this dimensionand their vibrations became ever denser. The Reptilians, Stewart says, werecreated by those he calls the ‘transparent people’ who ‘cannot really enter intothe physical dimensions because their energy vibratory rate is so high that itcannot sustain a physical body’. When they appear, he says, ‘it looks like atransparent glass shell’.At first, the Reptilians were ‘borderline physical’ and to function here theyneeded a physical form. This was achieved by mixing Reptilian genes with thoseof the Lyrians. This is why the Reptilians are so obsessed with blond-haired andblue-eyed people – they need their genetics to operate in this reality. Thereyou have the reason why the deeply reptilian Windsors targeted the genes ofblond-haired, blue-eyed Princess Diana and discarded her once they had them. TheWindsor line had become so reptilian with its interbreeding that it needed amassive infusion of ‘Diana’ genes to maintain an apparently human form. TheReptilians were located in the Draco star system, Stewart writes, and they beganto expand across the galaxy by conquests of the kind we are experiencing on thisplanet. I should stress here that claims about coming from this or that planetor star system does not necessarily mean the ones we know in this dimension, orreality. Planets and stars have multiple realities and, while they may looklifeless within this frequency range, they could be teeming with life in othersbeyond human sight. Stewart says the Reptilians have been assisted in theirconquests by a race from Sirius, the brightest star seen from Earth. Thereappear to be many extraterrestrial/other-dimensional visitors with benevolent ormalevolent ambitions for this planet. Among them are the Reptilians and thosefrom Sirius; groups from the Orion system that include some of those known asthe ‘Greys’ with the big black eyes; another race of Greys from Zeta Reticuli, abinary star system located around forty light years away from Earth in theconstellation of Reticulum; a group from the Andromeda constellation; and thereare apparently others from the Pleiades star system, known as the Seven Sisters,in the constellation of Taurus. The most malevolent, however, are the DraconianReptilians. Stewart Swerdlow says they are programmed to believe they are thesuperior form and believe themselves more ‘God-like’ because they areandrogynous. They have a programmed mentality that wants to conquer everythingand the British and Roman Empires – the work of the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines– are examples of this at work. Stewart says that the fusing of Reptilian geneswith those of the Lyrians, and others, is why humans have so much reptilian DNAand why foetuses go through reptilian-type development in the womb on their wayto becoming ‘human’. He also explains that royal and aristocratic families havelong been called ‘blue bloods’ because the increased Reptilian DNA means theirblood contains more copper. This copper-based blood turns blue-green whenoxidizing, he says, hence the term ‘blue bloods’.When Mu/Lemuria was destroyed, the survivors relocated to northern India andbuilt a massive underground civilisation (which is described in endless legendsand accounts). They also re-launched their genetic takeover and the locationthey chose, Stewart says, was … Sumer. He says the Sumerians became known as the‘Sum-Aryans’, or simply Aryans, and they expanded into northern Africa, centralAsia, northern India and the steppes of Russia. ‘The Aryan leaders, allbluebloods, became the Sultans and Rajas of legend’, Stewart writes. He saysthat when the Aryans mixed with the Dravidians (formerly from Lemuria) in India,they created the Hindu religion – ‘The caste system of India is a direct copy ofthe Reptilian division of function’. The Sumer- Aryans infiltrated Egyptiansociety and implanted their Reptilian bloodline into the royal families of thepharaohs, not least through the Hyksos kings. The Hyksos symbol was the snakeand their colour was red – highly significant in Reptilian ritual – and theirkings wore the Red Crown. Stewart says, quite rightly, that the Egyptians alsobecame known as the Phoenicians and were descendants of Atlantis. As ‘Lyrians’,they were blond-haired and blue-eyed with some who were green-eyed andred-haired. The Phoenician/Egyptians sailed to the British Isles and theAmericas, as archaeological evidence and other finds have shown (see The BiggestSecret). The Sumerians also travelled throughout Africa taking their hybridbloodline with them. Credo Mutwa said the ‘Chitauri’ interbred directly, orthrough their hybrids, with all races to create the bloodline-computer networkthrough which they rule in all continents. He said the ‘royal’ bloodlines ofblack African kings and queens claimed descent from the same ‘gods’ as the white‘royalty’ across the world.The Reptilian undergroundIndia was not the only place where the Reptilians and their bloodlines relocatedunderground after the end of Mu/Lemuria. They established underground cities allover the planet, and today many of these interconnect with the tunnel systemsand underground bases built in more recent times by the secret military projectsorchestrated by the Reptilian hybrids. The stories of Reptilians, and othernon-human races, living within the Earth in what we would today call ‘bases’,cities or tunnel networks, can be found widely described in ancient accounts.The Nagas, or serpent people, in India and throughout Asia and the Far East,were said to live in two main underground centres called Patala and Bhogavati.From there, according to Hindu legend, they battle for power with a ‘white’ raceknown to UFO researchers as the ‘Nordics’ (Stewart Swerdlow’s ‘Lyrians’) andlocated in the underground kingdoms of Agharta and Shambala. Hindus believe thatPatala can be entered at the Well of Sheshna in Benares, while Bhogavati isbelieved to be in the Himalayas. Similar stories of underground caverns andtunnel systems can be found in Tibet and China. In the Gilgamesh stories ofMesopotamia we are told of underground cities. Gilgamesh was a ‘demigod’ and‘semi-divine’ (Reptilian hybrid) who sought the immortality of the ‘gods’. Thestories speak of KI-GAL, or ‘the Great Below’, which was ruled by the goddess,Ereshkigal, and the god, Mergal. In the KI-GAL were violent guardians called‘scorpion men’, reanimated human bodies, spirits and the ‘undead’, and roboticbeings known as Galatur or Gala, which were used to abduct humans from thesurface. There were ‘eagle-headed’ Reptilians, which were often said to havewings. The accounts describe a race called the Pazazu, a dog-faced ‘human’ withreptilian scales and a tail. All this sounds remarkably like the grotesquescenes described by some workers at underground military bases today like Dulcein New Mexico (see The Biggest Secret for the detail).Chinese legend claims there is an underground world entered from the EasternMountain of Taishan, and guarded by vicious demons called Men Shen withanimal-like faces or masks. This was the Chinese ‘Hell’ and it is said that theLords of Hell interacted with the Dragon Kings on the surface. The Japanese‘Hell’, or underground network, was similar, and among the non-human entitieswere the Kappa, semi-aquatic reptilian humanoids and other shapeshifters wholived in mountains under the ground or under the sea. Stewart Swerdlow says thatthe Reptilians also developed hybrid bloodlines with a race from Rigel in theOrion system, now called the ‘Greys’, with their distinctive black eyes. Thesebloodlines, he says, became the royal bloodlines of China and Japan. Credo Mutwasays there are many legends throughout Africa about courageous people goingunderground to be with the gods. In Viking–Norse legend they have the giantserpent, Nidhoggr or Jormungand, that lived underground and this was similar tothe giant serpent, Apophis, in Egyptian myth. The Scandinavians and Germans hadtheir Huldre, or ‘Hidden Folk’, who were also known as the elves. One of thename-codes for the bloodline is ‘elven’ and the beings of folklore like trolls,etins, fairies, elves, troglodytes, Nefilim, Brownies (or Braunies) and the‘little people’ of Ireland are all different names for the subterranean entitiesdescribed in the modern accounts of ‘ET bases’, including the ‘Greys’, who wouldappear to be subordinate to the Reptilians. All the same stories are associatedwith these underground ‘people’, including interbreeding with humans. They evenmention the ‘missing time’ experience of people abducted by the ‘fairies’ (likemodern ‘UFO’ abductees) and include many stories of these ‘underground folk’,killing and mutilating cattle and taking the blood, just as reported today allover the world.Researcher Michael Mott has produced an excellent collection of stories on theseunderground dwellers in folklore and myth in his book, Caverns, Cauldrons, andConcealed Creatures. He writes that England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland allhave endless traditions of underground peoples with many similarities and commonorigins between them. It seems to be that Scotland, Ireland and the BritishIsles in general are a major centre for the Reptilian bloodlines, not leastbecause of the number of entrances to the underground world. It is the same inFrance, Germany and the highly significant Caucasus Mountains between the BlackSea and Caspian Sea, which I will come to later. What is really under theWindsors’ Balmoral Castle or the late Queen Mother’s Glamis Castle in Scotland?There is a legendary ‘secret room’ at Glamis. According to one guest, the writerSir Walter Scott, and others, it is the family’s law or custom that the secretis known only to three people at any one time. They take a ‘terrible oath’ notto reveal the secret. Another guest, Lord Halifax, said that in 1875 a workmanat the castle came across a door leading to a long passageway. The maninvestigated, but then he saw something that made him run back in terror. Whenthe 13th Earl of Strathmore was told what the workman had seen, he persuaded himto accept money to emigrate and give his word never to reveal what he saw. LordHalifax said that after the incident the Earl was a changed man, who becamesilent and moody, with an ‘anxious, scared face’. The Norse/Germanic fairies,goblins, trows, knockers, brownies, leprechauns, sidhe (shee), tylwyth teg(terlooeth teig) and so on, were either malevolent or indifferent to humanity,Michael Mott says. They lived, virtually without exception, under the ground.Hills, mounds, ruins, hill-forts, mountains, cliffs and ancient cities were saidto be the ‘rooftops’ of their palaces. Beings that mirror modern reports of theSasquatch (Big Foot) and the Yeti (Abominable Snowman) can be found in ancientstories of underground creatures that come to the surface. Like the Nagas, theserpent people of Asia, European folklore often claimed that these ‘fairy’people entered their underground homes through lakes. Michael Mott continues:> To remove all doubt as to their relationship with Norse hidden-folk and Indian> Nagas alike, they shunned the sunlight [like the symbolic Dracula], and often> seemed interested in crossbreeding their own bloodlines with those of human> beings, or even in crossbreeding their ‘livestock’ or fairy cattle, horses,> hounds and so forth with the surface species which were most compatible. The> goblin-dwarf, Rumplestiltskin, in his lust to have the human baby and its> genetic bounty, is just one example of this in folklore. > The elves took a regular interest in human affairs – weddings, births and> deaths, [bloodlines], the success of crops and livestock, and so forth – but> only for their own selfish interests. They seemed to be overly-concerned with> genetic and biological diversity, and they pilfered livestock, crops and human> genes via theft or cross-species liaison whenever they saw fit to do so. The> elves are generally depicted as extremely fair-haired and fair-skinned. The accounts even include the idea of being imprisoned underground waiting forthe day of judgement. Michael Mott summarises the common attributes of theinner-earth peoples of global folklore:> They are mostly reptilian or reptilian humanoids or ‘fair’ and Nordic; they> are telepathic with superior mental powers; they can shapeshift and create> illusions; they want to interbreed with humans and need human blood, flesh and> reproductive materials; they have advanced technology; they have the secret of> immortality; they can fly, either by themselves or with their technology; they> mostly have a malevolent agenda for humans; they cannot survive for long in> direct sunlight; they have been banished from the surface world or are in> hiding from surface people and/or the Sun; they want to keep their treasures,> knowledge and true identity a secret; they covertly manipulate events on the> surface world; they have surface humans working for them through the> priesthoods, cults and secret societies; they have a putrid smell like> ‘sulphur and brimstone’. The accounts are incredibly consistent over thousands of years and the ‘sulphursmell’ is constantly reported by people today who claim to have been abducted byreptilian entities. Mott writes:> The reptilian aspect of some underworlders permeates folklore. One universal> theme that recurs in the folktales of many, many cultures is that of the> snake-husband or snake-wife, who can transform into a ‘human’ or humanoid form> and is invariably [of course] of royal blood among his or her own kind … Often> the snake or serpent-man exacts a promise of marriage, or the hand of an> unborn human child in betrothal, consistent with the theme of the> subterranean’s interest in maintaining their own genetic diversity. > A variant of this should be familiar to most readers of fairy tales, in the> form of ‘The Frog Prince’. The frog-prince is a Handsome Prince, but like the> Japanese seducing dragon, he has a reptilian or amphibian form.

The serpentine-yet-human Nagas are still believed by devout> Hindus and some Buddhists to dwell beneath India, Nepal and Tibet. This, again, all sounds so like the reports of underground bases and citiesacross the world today, not least in the United States. Researcher Alan Waltonhas written extensively about the Reptilian connection under the pseudonym,‘Branton’. He says:> Underneath most major cities, especially in the USA in fact, there exist> subterranean counterpart ‘cities’ controlled by the Masonic/hybrid/alien> ‘elite’. Often surface/subsurface terminals exist beneath Masonic Lodges,> police stations, airports and federal buildings of major cities … and even not> so ‘major’ cities.

This does not include the> fullblood reptilian species who live in even deeper recesses of the Earth. > Some of the major population centers were deliberately established by the> Masonic/hybrid elite of the Old and New ‘worlds’ to afford easy access to> already existing underground levels, some of which are thousands of years old.> Considering that the Los Alamos Labs [in New Mexico] had a working prototype> nuclear powered thermolbore drill that could literally melt tunnels through> the Earth at a rate of 8 mph forty years ago, you can imagine how extensive> these underground systems have become. > These sub-cities also offer close access to organised criminal syndicates,> which operate on the surface.

Or rather the ancient underground ‘Atlantean’ systems that network> beneath that area. They literally control the entire Wall Street pyramid from> below … with more than a little help from reptilian bloodlines like the> Rockefellers, etc. In fact, these reptilian genetic lines operate in a> parasitic manner, the underground society acting as the ‘parasite’ society and> the surface society operating as the ‘host’ society … I know that the content of this chapter will be very challenging to most peoplebecause it is so far from the official history imposed by the Reptilian system.But then that’s the idea: to divert us from the truth so they can continue togather ever more control, while we have no idea what’s going on. The humanbody-computer has been bred, or rather encoded, to be a slave to the will of itsmakers, and so far we have played our parts brilliantly. We have allowed theprogram to dictate our perception and behaviour, rather than our InfiniteAwareness, and we have had our attention diverted from seeing who thecontrollers are. While humans have been focused on survival or irrelevantdiversions like game shows and ‘celebrity’ gossip, a few interbreedingbloodlines or computer programs have seized ever more power and influence.Today, after thousands of years of scheming, they are on the brink of globaldictatorship.However, it is also the case that a mass awakening is underway and I am seeing adramatic increase in the number of people opening their minds to the suppressedhistory and the nature of human control. I have been ridiculed, condemned andabused in many and various ways for making this information public, and it stillgoes on to an extent among the concrete minds and the agents of those who wishme to be silenced. But so many more are now listening and it’s increasing by theday. People are freeing themselves from a lifetime of programming and, as theydo so, they are seeing that the apparently fantastic is actually true."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 4 Kingdom of shadows > Condemnation without investigation is the highest form of ignorance. > Albert Einstein Accounts of the Reptilians and their bloodlines are not confined to the ancientworld. I have compiled a mass of information in other books from the experiencesof people today that mirror those described in global folklore and nativehistories.Particularly since around 1998, I have met hundreds of people in many countriesand cultures who have told me the same basic story of seeing someone‘shapeshift’ from a ‘human’ into a reptilian form and back again. Othernon-reptilian entities are also reported in many accounts, but Reptiliansconstantly recur. Often the shapeshifters are people in power and authority, butfar from always. Royal and aristocratic families, especially the BritishWindsors, are a major theme in the reports of those who have seen a reptilianshapeshift, as are the Bush family in America and the big banking families likethe Rothschilds and Rockefellers. Books like The Biggest Secret, Children of theMatrix and Tales from the Time Loop include these detailed accounts and so thereis no need to repeat them all here. The ‘dot’ I want to deal with in thissection is how shapeshifting is possible because at first hearing, and secondcome to that, it sounds impossible to the perception of reality that we arepedalled by the system.There are ‘physical’ Reptilians living underground that are operating within thefrequency range of human sight, but the most powerful ones are beyond thisdimension. To understand the world we need to remember at all times that it isan illusion, and the ‘physical’ reality we think is ‘outside’ of us actuallyonly exists in that form in our heads. Even the term ‘our heads’ is an illusion,as we’ve seen. The ‘3D’ world is a series of thought fields – information fields– which our brain decodes into apparently three-dimensional forms. The ‘humanbody’, like the reptilian form, is not ‘physical’ at all. They are bothenergetic fields of consciousness that the brain ‘reads’ into illusory reality,much like the television decodes frequency broadcasts into pictures on thescreen. Shapeshifting is not a shift between two physical bodies, it is a shiftin the decoding system of the brain. Stewart Swerdlow says that the Reptiliangeneticists wanted a 50-50 mix of genetics to produce a body that looked humanwhile being able to shapeshift into reptilian form. ‘Shapeshifting wasaccomplished simply by concentrating on the genetics the hybrid wished to open,or lock up, whatever the case may be’, he writes. These genetic codes are, likeeverything, vibrational codes and energetic fields and, on one level,mathematical computer codes. The shapeshift is the movement between two fields,or sets of genetic codes, which the brain reads into holographic ‘physical’reality. When the codes – fields – are switched on and off the experience of theobserver is to see someone transform from a human form to a Reptilian and thenback again. But only in their brain does this happen ‘physically’. It is a bitlike switching channels on the TV. People have a major problem understanding theshapeshift phenomena because, understandably, they are thinking in terms of adense physical body changing into another. It doesn’t work like that – andcouldn’t.The Holographic veilThe Reptilians created their hybrid bloodlines as a sort of genetic spacesuit(actually a vibrational field) to hide their true form from the human massesthey seek to control. For those in ‘physical’ reptilian form, the Reptilian‘fullbloods’ as researchers call them, the human ‘cover’ is a holographicprojection that tricks the brain of the observer into reading that instead ofthe reptilian field ‘behind’ it. You can be looking at a Reptilian, but ‘see’ ahuman. Ancient tales and folklore are full of stories about the ‘Hidden Folk’who could ‘shapeshift’ and appear in different forms. I stress that they areworking with a far more advanced understanding of reality while keeping thatknowledge from the human population. Christine Fitzgerald, an alternative healerin London and a close confidant of Princess Diana for nine years, is just onesource who told me that the Windsors are a Reptilian bloodline. She explainedhow this human veil or hologram is created:> To be honest, the royal family hasn’t died for a long time, they have just> metamorphosised. It’s sort of cloning, but in a different way. They take> pieces of flesh and rebuild the body from one little bit. Because it’s lizard,> because it’s cold-blooded, it’s much easier to do this Frankenstein shit than> it is for us. The different bodies are just different electrical vibrations> and they have got that secret; they’ve got the secret of the micro-currents;> it’s so micro, so specific, these radio waves that actually create the bodies. > They know the vibration of life and because they’re cold-blooded, they are> reptiles, they have no wish to make the Earth the perfect harmony it could be,> or to heal the Earth from the damage that’s been done.

They can manifest> how they want to. > All the real knowledge has been taken out and shredded and put back in another> way … Most people, the hangers on, don’t know, you know, about the reptiles.> They are just in awe of these people because they are so powerful. The bodies or computers of the hybrid bloodlines are also used by Reptiliansoutside this dimension to covertly manipulate us. When these other-dimensionalReptilians and other entities enter the frequency range of human sight they canobviously be seen, but most of the time they operate just beyond the normalrange of visible light and we cannot see them. Nor can they physically interactwith this world unless they have an outer shell that is vibrating within thisfrequency range. Radio and television frequencies can pass through ‘solid’ wallsbecause they are on different wavelengths. In the same way, these Reptilians ontheir ‘wavelength’ cannot directly interact with ours unless they have an outer‘body’ through which to do so. This is where the hybrid bloodlines come in. Thegenetic manipulation created an outer shell that looks human to our five-sensevision, but also carries a vibrational code sympathetic to that of theReptilians. This allows the other-dimensional Reptilians to ‘possess’ thesehybrid ‘body-computers’ and take over their mental and emotional processes –therefore their behaviour – much more effectively than they can with the mass ofthe people who have far less reptilian genetics (vibrational/computer codecompatibility). The aim is to manipulate these hybrid bloodlines into thepositions of power and, in doing so, put themselves in those positions while thepeople perceive only their human level. Have you ever seen scientists in alaboratory put their hands and arms into long ‘gloves’ inside a tank when it istoo dangerous to touch the materials directly? Well, the principle is the same.The other-dimensional Reptilians manipulate this dimension from their dimensionby using the hybrid ‘spacesuits’ that the genetic manipulation by the ‘physical’Reptilians or ‘fullbloods’ has created. It is also possible to manipulategenetics vibrationally and mathematically from another dimension. Women who havebeen raped in satanic rituals designed to impregnate them with the ‘Devil’sseed’ have told me how they saw ethereal non-human entities overshadowing the‘human’ rapist. They appear to be ‘ethereal’ when viewed from this reality, butthey’re still a form of physicality, albeit of a different density.There are so many stories among native and ancient peoples which relate theconsumption of hallucinogenic potions with ‘seeing the gods’. The potion takesthem into other levels of consciousness where they can perceive beyond the veilof the five senses. I was invited to an event in the Brazilian rainforest in2003 where people were taking the hallucinogenic plant called ayahuasca after somany previous participants had reported seeing reptilian entities and imagery.The Olmec people of Central America, whose whole culture was based on serpentworship, used to take hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms that they called ‘theflesh of the Plumed Serpent’, and this took them into other-dimensionalawareness – the serpent frequency. In their rituals to the ‘serpent son’,Dionysus, the Greek initiates would drink strong wine and take mind-alteringdrugs and mushrooms to ‘unite with their Son of God’. Advanced psychics can alsodo the same because they have the ability to tune their minds to otherfrequencies. When I was speaking at an event in the United States, a giftedpsychic lady told me how she sees people in power, like Henry Kissinger, FatherGeorge Bush and Hillary Clinton, transform into Reptilians all the time. Onceagain she is accessing their frequency levels beyond the five senses and beyondthe ‘cover’ of an apparently ‘human’ form. You see the recurring theme invirtually all cultures. In Islam, they have the ‘Jinn’ who are said to beinvisible to humans, while they can see us. A higher frequency can see a denserfrequency, but not the other way round. Muslims believe that the Jinn can comeinto view to humans and they are said to have societies not unlike ours wherethey eat, marry and die, although live much longer lives. The belief is that theJinn can possess humans and most Islamic scholars say the Koran states that the‘Devil’ was a Jinn. The ‘evil’ ones among them are looked upon like the demonsin Christianity and Judaism, and you can see that what is believed about theJinn relates to what I am saying about Reptilian possession and theirother-dimensional nature.A point to make here: I am asked why people throughout history would give theirlives to advancing the conspiracy when they knew they would not be here when theglobal dictatorship was finally installed. It’s an understandable question andthere are two main answers: the lower levels of gofers and bag men areprogrammed to serve the agenda, and those with the real power don’t have thesame relationship to ‘time’ that we do in this reality. From their ‘dimension’,they can track along our ‘timeline’ or DVD and come in and out at any point theychoose. So the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines, and operatives throughout what wecall ‘history’, have been the same Reptilian entities all along. Only theirhuman ‘cover’ has changed.The Iguana raceCathy O’Brien was a long-time victim of the US government mind-control operationcalled MKULTRA that has now been exposed, up to a point, by even the mainstreammedia. So much more goes unreported, however, including an elite offshoot ofMKULTRA known as Project Monarch, in which mind-controlled slaves like Cathywere forced to serve the will and desires of US presidents and others in thoseechelons of power and higher. Project Monarch predominently uses blond-haired,blue-eyed people, which by now will be no surprise. When Cathy escaped fromtheir clutches and began her deprogramming she remembered her extraordinary andhorrific experiences as the blocks on her memory were removed. She wrote anamazing book called Trance- Formation of America with her deprogrammer, MarkPhillips, in which she describes her unspeakable experiences with people likeDick Cheney, Father George Bush and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Some of theseexperiences involved reptilian themes, including seeing Father George transformfacially into a reptile form. She and Mark believe these experiences to be partof her mind control using holographic imagery. I understand that, but everythingin this reality is a hologram anyway. When I put together what she describeswith all the other accounts I have compiled from around the world – ancient andmodern – they correspond exactly. I have been told by hundreds of people fromevery walk of life you can imagine about their experiences of seeing well-knownand less well-known people transform into a reptilian form before their eyes,and then go back again. Father George Bush is a name that recurs often in theseaccounts. Cathy relates an experience she had with Miguel de la Madrid, thePresident of Mexico during Father Bush’s tenure at the White House. She writesin Trance-Formation of America:> De La Madrid had relayed the ‘legend of the Iguana’ to me, explaining that> lizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, their> advanced astronomical technology, including sacrifice of virgins, was> supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens> interbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit, they> fluctuated between a human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like> abilities – ‘a perfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders’. De la> Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he> transformed ‘back into an Iguana at will’. This is exactly the same story told in Central America that you find in Africa,Asia and around the world. The ancient Mayans left behind evidence of theirhighly advanced knowledge of mathematics, astronomy and cosmic cycles of ‘time’.They also constructed amazing cities and pyramids. The Reptilians built pyramidsin many places including Sumer, Egypt, Central America and China. Pyramidbuilding is one of their ‘cultural’ signatures. They could move stones weighinghundreds of tons because they knew how to manipulate illusory reality usingmagnetic fields to make the stones hover in weightlessness. It is the sameprinciple as the new ‘maglev’ or magnetic levitation trains that are now beingintroduced. Despite their enormous weight the magnetic field makes them floatabove the ‘track’ and this is how all those fantastic ancient structures werebuilt by ‘primitive’ people. Researcher James Churchward told in books like TheChildren of Mu how he established that the Mayans of Central America and theNagas of Asia were the same former Lemurian (Reptilian) peoples. The Mayans saythe first settlers of the Yucatan in Mexico were the Chanes or ‘People of theSerpent’. They were led by the god Itzamna, a name that apparently comes fromthe word ‘itzem’, which translates as lizard or reptile. The sacred city ofItzamna means ‘the place of the lizard’ or ‘Iguana House’. Cathy O’Brien alsorecalls in Trance-Formation of America, an experience with Bill and Bob Bennett,two well-known figures in US politics. Bill Bennett controlled American‘education’ during the Reagan–Bush administration and is closely connected tothe ‘Neocons’ behind the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Cathy says theBennetts gave her mind-altering drugs at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centermind-control laboratory, and they told her they were ‘alien to this dimension –two beings from another plane’. Cathy continues:> The high-tech light display around me convinced me I was transforming> dimensions with them. A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me,> which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party> – as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them. Not> recognising anyone, I frantically asked: ‘Who are these people?’ > ‘They’re not people and this isn’t a spaceship’, [Bill] Bennett said. As he> spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people> appeared to be lizard-like aliens. > ‘Welcome to the second level of the underground. This is a mere mirror> reflection of the first, an alien dimension. We are from a trans-dimensional> plane that spans and encompasses all dimensions … I have taken you through my> dimension as a means of establishing stronger holds on your mind than the> Earth plane permits’, Bill Bennett was saying. ‘Being alien, I simply make my> thoughts your thoughts by projecting them into your mind. My thoughts are your> thoughts …’ This is what the Reptilians want to do with the entire human race. One of theirmajor vehicles has been religion and, more recently, television and the ‘massmedia’. As I’ve indicated, the Reptilian ‘lower classes’ or ‘workers’ would seemto have a ‘hive’ mind rather than think individually, and they operate very muchlike ants picking up the instructions from the ‘Queen’ and acting accordingly.The Reptilians and their bloodlines are seeking to do this with humans andclearly, when you look around, they have made great progress already. The planto microchip people is all part of this, and so is the minute-by-minuteprogramming and conditioning by television and media, which is targeting thereptilian brain. Researcher Skip Largent explains:> All movies and television are a projection of the reptilian brain. How so?> Movies and television (video games etc.) are all undeniably dreamlike, not> only in their presentation of symbolic-reality, but also in that humans> experiencing movies, etc., have the same brain wave patterns as when they are> dreaming. And guess where dreaming originates in your head? In the reptilian> brain (although other parts of our brain are involved). The ‘language’ of the> reptilian brain is visual imagery. All communications transferred by reptiles> are done so by visual symbolic representations, each having specific meaning. Stewart Swerdlow says that from his knowledge gleaned from the ‘inside’, theReptilian–Nordic/’Lyrian’ hybrids were designed to be ‘tuned’ to the Reptilianfrequencies and could, therefore, be controlled by them. This is the key tounderstanding our current plight. The non–’physical’ Reptilians operate from adimension close to this one, but just outside of human sight. In fact, it is notso much a ‘dimension’ as a ‘world’ between dimensions. One scientist I know, theItalian physicist and writer Giuliana Conforto, calls these in-between realmsthe ‘interspace planes’. In the African tradition of Credo Mutwa, they arecalled ‘the heaven between heavens’. It is like a ‘crevice’, a neutral zone,between dimensions and it is from here, a vibrational fraction beyond humansight, that the Reptilians ‘possess’ their hybrid Nefilim bloodlines and,through them, manipulate our reality. Long before I became aware of any of this,I had an experience with the former British Prime Minister, Ted Heath, aReptilian shapeshifter and child abuser (see The Biggest Secret). Reptilianhybrids and child abuse so often go together. I met Heath in a television studiomake-up room in 1989 while we were waiting for the make-up lady to arrive. WhenI said ‘hello’, he didn’t reply, but just stared at me. His gaze started at thetop of my head and then went slowly down to my feet and back again, like he wasscanning me. As he did so, both his eyes turned jet black, including the whites,and I can only say that it was like looking into two black holes with no pointwhere my eyes could make contact with his. I was shocked and bewildered by whatI experienced, but not anymore. I now know I was looking through his eyes intothe frequency range, the interspace plane, where his possessing entity waslocated. Over the years I have met others who have had this ‘black eyes’experience around the world.The Emerald TabletsAs I have said, I am not going to repeat all the information I have gatheredabout the Reptilians from ancient and modern experience when it can be found inmy other books. The focus of this one is to connect the dots, not include everydetail, but there is something in previous books that I want to include herebecause it is so important to comprehending what has happened and is happening.I am talking about the Emerald Tablets, which are said to have been discoveredbeneath a Mayan temple in Mexico. They describe the Reptilians, their ability toshapeshift and how they possess people in power. The accounts correlateremarkably with modern experience and reports. They are known in full as theEmerald Tablets of Thoth, who was a deity of the Egyptians. It is claimed thatthey date back 36,000 years and were written by Thoth, an ‘AtlanteanPriest-King’ who, it is said, founded a colony in Egypt. His tablets, the storygoes, were taken to South America by Egyptian ‘pyramid priests’ and eventuallyplaced under a Mayan temple to the Sun god in the Yucatan, Mexico. Thetranslator of these tablets, Maurice Doreal, claims to have recovered them andcompleted the translations in 1925. Only much later was he given ‘permission’for part of them to be published, he says. You can read the whole tale and thecontent of the Tablets on this website: crystalinks.com/emerald.html[http://crystalinks.com/emerald.html]. There is also a book. You don’t have toaccept all the details of that story to appreciate the synchronicity betweenwhat these tablets say and what is now being uncovered. The Tablets tell of the‘children of shadows’ manipulating this reality:> Speak I of ancient Atlantis, speak of the days of the Kingdom of Shadows,> speak of the coming of the children of shadows. Out of the great deep were> they called by the wisdom of Earth-man, called for the purpose of gaining> great power. > Far in the past before Atlantis existed, men there were who delved into> darkness, using dark magic, calling up beings from the great deep below us.> Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration,> existing unseen by the children of Earth-men. Only through blood could they> form being, only through man could they live in the world. > In ages past were they conquered by the Masters, driven below to the place> whence they came. But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces and> planes unknown to man. Live they in Atlantis as shadows, but at times they> appeared among men. Aye, when the blood was offered, forth came they to dwell> among men. > In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as are> men. Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted, but appearing to man as men> among men. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men.> Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling> o’er man. Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their> faces be seen. Sought they from the kingdom of shadows, to destroy man and> rule in his place. > But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil from the> face of the serpent, able to send him back to his place. Came they to man and> taught him the secret, the Word that only a man can pronounce; swift then they> lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from place among men. > Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open, at times, to> the world. Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have been> said; again as time passes onward, shall they take the semblance of men. > Called, may they be, by the master who knows the white or the black, but only> the white master may control and bind them while in the flesh. > Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only the> master of brightness shall conquer the shadow of fear. > Know ye, O my brother, that fear is an obstacle great; be master of all in the> brightness, the shadow will soon disappear. Hear ye, and heed my wisdom, the> voice of LIGHT is clear, seek the valley of shadow and light only will appear. Whatever the origins of this information, it tells the story of the Reptilianmanipulation and how it is done. Kings and queens, leading politicians, bankingand business leaders, major media owners and heads of the military are the‘serpent-headed beings’ hidden behind human form (or their puppets and stooges).These are the Reptilian hybrids and they have duped humanity by appearing to behuman and coming from diverse backgrounds. They are not and do not: they are thesame Reptilian tribe. The Emerald Tablets tell of how the Reptilians seek ‘fromthe kingdom of shadows’, to destroy ‘man’ and rule in his place. The Kingdom ofShadows, the ‘hidden spaces and planes unknown to man’, are the interspaceplanes, a fraction beyond human vision. The phrase ‘only by sound could theirfaces be seen’ refers to the fact that a certain sound frequency will break theenergy construct of their projected ‘human’ holograms and what lurks behind canthen be decoded into form – Reptilian form. Interestingly, the Tablets say that‘in ages past were they conquered by the Masters, driven below to the placewhence they came’. This is mirrored in the biblical passage in the Book ofRevelation where the ‘Devil’ is described in reptilian terms:> And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the> Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to Earth> and his angels were cast down with him. > … And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and> Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and> shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more. The ancient Book of Enoch also describes how ‘God’ demanded action against the‘fallen angels’, especially one called Azâzêl:> … the Lord said to Raphael: ‘Bind Azâzêl hand and foot, and cast him into the> darkness: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dûdâêl, and cast him> therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with> darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may not> see light. And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the> fire. And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the> healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the children> of men may not perish through all the secret things that the Watchers have> disclosed and have taught their sons. And the whole earth has been corrupted> through the works that were taught by Azâzêl: to him ascribe all sin …’ > … The Lord commands Michael to bind the fallen angels. And the Lord said unto> Michael: ‘Go, bind Semjâzâ and his associates who have united themselves with> women so as to have defiled themselves with them in all their uncleanness. And> when their sons have slain one another, and they have seen the destruction of> their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of> the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the> judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated.’ The nature of the ‘Lord’ that is being talked about here and similar texts isn’tclear, but it must be said that there are Reptilian races that do not act likethe Nefilim and their masters and there are many other extraterrestrial sourcesthat are seeking to remove their control of this reality and allow humanity toexperience in freedom. Wherever the Nefilim have gone they have performed blooddrinking and human sacrifice rituals when they interact with theirother-dimensional masters – ‘Unseen they walk among thee in places where therites have been said’, as the Emerald Tablets put it. They also identify thereason why Satanism and the Reptilian hybrids are so connected:> Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration,> existing unseen by the children of earth-men ... Only through blood could they> form being, only through man could they live in the world. This is describing how the Reptilians operate in another frequency range beyondhuman sight and to manipulate this reality they must have a ‘body’ through whichto do it – ‘only through man could they live in this world’. The point about‘only through blood could they form into being’ explains why the Reptilianhybrids in power today are obsessed with blood drinking and human sacrificerituals, just as they have been since they arrived aeons ago in our version of‘time’. The bloodlines of the ‘Watchers’ or ‘fallen angels’ are behind the warsand dictatorships in all their forms throughout history and right up to thepresent day. They glory in the pain and slaughter of their victims and to them awar is just a massive blood sacrifice ritual. What is now happening every day inIraq would be orgasmic to them.Reptilian vampiresThey have always taken part in human sacrifice to ‘the gods’, theirother-dimensional Reptilian masters, and drunk the blood of humans to givevibrational sustenance to their holographic human energy field, their ‘veil’.Stewart Swerdlow says the Reptilians need mammalian hormonal levels to hold themammalian DNA (computer) codes open and maintain human form. Their ‘base-line’state is reptilian and the mammalian codes would close if they did not consumefrequent supplies of human blood. They also want an adrenaline that enters thebloodstream in large quantities at times of extreme terror. They tell theirvictims they are going to be sacrificed and they use the ritual to build theirterror to the point of death. This allows them to drink blood full of thatadrenaline. Another survivor of the Illuminati mind-control programme, ArizonaWilder, formerly Jennifer Greene, supplies the same information from her ownhorrific experience in the sacrifice rituals. She says that the blood-type theReptilians most desire is that of blond-haired, blue-eyed people. The originalinterbreeding involved the human-like ‘Nordic’ or ‘Lyrian’ genetics and so thatblood is the most effective for the purpose of holding human form. Arizona, likealmost every ‘elite’ mind controlled slave I have encountered, is blond-hairedand blue-eyed and she dyed her hair when she escaped in an effort to break theprogramming. Blond-haired, blue-eyed people are also the ones chosen most oftento be sacrificed by the Illuminati. Red-haired people also seem very importantto them for the same reason and, most of all, they want the blood ofpre-pubescent children and young women who have not had sex. This is to do withthe purity of the blood and energy of children, and the changes that take placewithin the energy field once a person has experienced sex or puberty. Theysacrifice children and young women more than anyone and this is the origin ofthe stories throughout history of sacrificing ‘young virgins’ to the gods – theReptilians ‘gods’.The relationship of Reptilians and their hybrids to humans is that of a farmerto cattle and they use us in the same way. The ancient Egyptians even calledthemselves the ‘Cattle of Ra’ – their Sun god Ra. The full bloods and hybridseat humans as humans eat cattle, and they conduct their sacrifice rituals toproduce the hormones and chemicals they desire. The fear-induced adrenaline rushin the sacrificial victim produces a hormone called adrenochrome which has beenlikened to an hallucinogenic drug like a mild form of LSD. They are seeking tostimulate the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin that can activateinterdimensional communication through the pineal gland in the centre of thebrain, which connects with the ‘third-eye’chakra that governs psychic ‘sight’.Another way they trigger cosmic communication, it would appear, is through asubstance known as monatomic gold. This is a white powder produced from aprocess that starts out as gold and ends up as a fine powder. It also occursnaturally in some parts of the world and can be absorbed by plants. Monatomicgold is apparently a superductor of electrical energy and this, along with otherproperties, can open up the channels to multidimensional reality. It ‘lights up’the body, if you like, and makes it superconductive. The ancient traditions ofalchemy that were once widespread all over the world believed that metals likecopper, silver and gold could be transformed into a fine white powder that couldbe swallowed to produce miraculous spiritual and healing properties. The word‘elixir’ comes from the Arabic ‘Al-Iksir’, meaning powder. It was said that thisalchemical knowledge went back to the foundations of human civilization – the‘gods’. You can buy monatomic gold today, but it’s good to be very selectivebecause most of the stuff on the market is not the best.When I have exposed the human sacrifice and blood drinking rituals involvingsome of the world’s most famous people, it has been hard for many to take.However, when you identify the origin of these bloodlines and follow themthrough history, it would be a shock if they were not taking part in suchhorrors, given that they always have and, for their genetic purposes, need to.Today, these include the Bushes, Clintons, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, theBritish Royal Family, prime ministers like Tony Blair and professionalmanipulators such as Henry Kissinger. The rituals happen according to ancientlore on the same ‘satanic’ days that the rituals took place in Sumer, itssuccessor Babylon, and all the other Reptilian strongholds. Many take place atsecret ritual centres, others at royal and aristocratic castles and palaces likeBalmoral and Glamis Castle in Scotland. Glamis is the home of the late QueenMother, a serious Satanist. Stewart Swerdlow names some other major locationsfor the rituals as Land’s End and Loch Ness in the United Kingdom;Rennes-Le-Chateau and Brittany in France; Bavaria in Germany; Phoenix, Arizona;Montauk Point, New York; the Mojave Desert and Russian River in California; theeast coast of Florida; and the Channel Islands. He also cites the Great Pyramidat Giza and the castles of Europe, located over underground entrances to theinner-earth. These, he says, are most commonly found in Scotland, France,Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and Austria, but basically they are all over theworld, and a mild version of what goes on can be seen in Stanley Kubrick’s finalmovie, Eyes Wide Shut.Image [../Images/00056.jpg]Figure 51: The opening ritual at Bohemian Grove in front of the 40-foot stoneowl – symbolic of the Babylonian goddess and the ancient god called Molech,another name for Nimrod/Baal. You can buy the DVD exposing Bohemian Grove andfilmed on a hidden camera at www.prisonplanet.com [http://www.prisonplanet.com] One place I have been highlighting for years is Bohemian Grove, 2,700 acres ofsecluded and guarded redwood forest in Sonoma County, some 75 miles north of SanFrancisco, California. It is referred to in Stewart Swerdlow’s list as ‘RussianRiver’. Cathy O’Brien tells in her book, Trance-Formation of America, of how sheand her fellow mind-slaves were forced to serve the perversions of their abusersat Bohemian Grove. These include satanic rituals, child sacrifices, torture,rape and blood drinking. Cathy says: ‘Slaves of advancing age or with failedprogramming were ritually murdered at random in the wooded grounds of the Groveand I felt it was only a matter of time before it would be me’. She says thatBohemian Grove has a number of rooms for different perversions, including a DarkRoom, Leather Room, Necrophilia Room and one known as the Underground Lounge,spelt as U.N.derground on the sign. In Figures 51 and 52, robed and hooded menat the Grove stand alongside a large fire while worshipping a forty-foot stoneowl – an ancient symbol associated with the ‘mother goddess’ worship of theReptilians – and the same image appears on the ‘club’ logo (Figure 53) with the‘club’ motto: ‘Weaving Spiders Come Not Here’. The mother goddess in question,under endless different names, is possibly Ninkharsag, also known as Ninti(‘Lady Life’), whom the Sumerian Tablets say produced the first ‘modern’ humanwith chief scientist Enki, but, as I keep stressing, these symbols meandifferent things to different levels of initiation. The owl also represents thegod called Molech, another name for Nimrod/Baal, to whom the ancients sacrificedtheir children in fire rituals. Most people who attend the Grove have no ideawhat they are part of, but every year around July there is a ‘summer camp’ whenthe rich and famous of America and beyond arrive to ‘play’ while hidden from thepublic eye. The most elite of them take part in human sacrifice rituals andmind-controlled women and children are provided for their ‘pleasure’ (Figure54). This has been Nefilim behaviour in every age.Image [../Images/00057.jpg]Figure 52: Another image of the ‘Cremation of Care’ ritual attended by some ofthe most rich and powerful men in America and the wider world Image [../Images/00058.jpg]Figure 53: Bohemian Grove logo Among attendees at Bohemian Grove past and present are Boy George Bush; FatherGeorge Bush; Bill Clinton; Al Gore; Ronald Reagan; Richard Nixon; Jimmy Carter;Gerald Ford; Dwight D. Eisenhower; Lyndon Johnson; Herbert Hoover; TeddyRoosevelt; Dan Quayle; Robert Kennedy (JFK’s brother); Joseph Kennedy (JFK’sfather); Earl Warren (head of the Warren Commission, which ‘investigated’ JFK’smurder); David Rockefeller; Laurance Rockefeller; Nelson Rockefeller; HenryKissinger; Arnold Schwarzenegger, the place-man Governor of California; MikhailGorbachev (the Soviet Union countries and the ‘West’ were always controlled bythe same Reptilian tribe and still are); William F. Buckley, an Americanpublisher and major manipulator; George Shultz, the former Secretary of State toReagan–Bush, advisor to the ‘election’ campaign of Boy Bush, and leading lightin Bechtel, the company given massive contracts to ‘rebuild’ Iraq; WalterCronkite, America’s most famous news reader; William Randolph Hearst, theAmerican newspaper tycoon; Andrew Knight, a British media executive who has beenclosely connected to the Rupert Murdoch Empire; Edward Teller (‘Father of the Hbomb’); Glenn Seaborg, who developed plutonium; Burt Bacharach, the composer;singer Bing Crosby; comedian Bob Hope (a CIA and British MI6 operative and‘owner’ of mind-controlled women); Ray Kroc, the man behind the McDonald’sfast-food empire; and John Muir, founder of the environmental operation, theSierra Club. I am not saying they have all taken part in the sacrifice ritualsor abused women and children because Bohemian Grove operates on differentlevels, but most of the major political names, the Nefilim, most certainly haveor do. In Figure 55 (overleaf), you can see Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon atBohemian Grove during a speech by Glenn Seaborg. The picture was taken in 1957while Reagan was a B movie actor and Nixon was already a career politician. Bothwould become President of the United States.An insider speaks outI have spoken with countless people in different countries who have describedsacrifice rituals they have attended with people in positions of national andglobal power. They have described the British Royal Family shapeshifting andsacrificing their victims – see The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix.One source was a man called Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, now living underanother name in the United States, who says he is the unofficial son of the lateBaron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton-Rothschild wine estates in France(Figure 56, overleaf). The baron died in 1988 at the age of 86. The Rothschildsare one of the major Reptilian bloodlines on the planet and Phillip Eugene sayshe is one of hundreds of thousands of unofficial Rothschild offspring, most ofthem produced in sperm bank breeding programmes to ensure that the genetic(vibrational/computer code) ‘purity’ is both maintained and expanded. PhillipEugene told me: ‘My father was a decadent dilettante as well as a masterSatanist and hater of God, but how he loved the fields and the wines. He used tosay it brought out “the primitive in him”’. The estates are now run by BaronPhilippe’s daughter, Baroness Philippine, who, Phillip Eugene says, is his halfsister. He was, he writes, conceived by ‘occult incest’ which the Reptilianhybrids use to keep the bloodline ‘in house’. The main Reptilian familiesconceive countless children to perpetuate the bloodline and only a few are giventhe ‘official’ family name. The others are hidden behind other names and broughtup by other ‘parents’. Later they find themselves in significant positions,often not knowing at first why they got so ‘lucky’. The 1968 film, Rosemary’sBaby, directed by insider Roman Polanski, accurately portayed what happens. Themain character, played by Mia Farrow, is mind-controlled by Satanists with thesupport of her husband who is given fame and fortune for allowing his wife to beused as a vessel for a reptilian baby to be born. Polanski, who is now afugitive from the United States for having sex with a thirteen-year-old girl,was the husband of actress Sharon Tate, who was murdered while eight monthspregnant in 1969 by members of the ‘Manson Family’, the cult of mind-controlledSatanist, Charles Manson.Image [../Images/00059.jpg]Figure 54: A portrayal of Bohemian Grove by artist David Dees Image [../Images/00060.jpg]Figure 55: Bohemian Grove, 1957. Glenn Seaborg, the man who gave the worldplutonium, is flanked by Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. Despite their verydifferent backgrounds, both would go on to be presidents of the United Statesbecause of their connections to the Reptilian hybrid control-system Image [../Images/00061.jpg]Figure 56: Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton- Rothschild wine-producingestates in France, who died in 1988 at the age of 86 Phillip Eugene was placed within the ‘Christian’ Church to work on behalf of theagenda while appearing to be a perfect ‘Christian’. He says that for most of hischildhood and adolescence he lived with his Rothschild father on his estate inFrance. They had a physical relationship, he says, and he was ‘held fast in theemotional power of incest, which, in this culture, was normal and to be admired’(something confirmed to me many times from many sources). Bloodline sons likeBoy Bush would have been sexually ‘initiated’ by his father because that’s theway these strange people operate. Phillip Eugene said he observed his Rothschildfather’s ‘lust for power’ and began to desire the same. He also confirmed theway the ‘occult’ bloodlines are controlled by demonic entities. ‘Being aRothschild descendant’, he said, ‘I was maximally demonised’. He continues:> I was present at my father’s death in 1988, receiving his power and the> commission to carry out my destiny in the grand conspiracy of my family. Like> their other children, I played a key role in my family’s revolt from God. When> I watch CNN, it startles me to see so many familiar faces now on the world> stage in politics, art, finance, fashion and business. I grew up with these> people, meeting them at ritual worship sites and in the centers of power.> Financiers, artists, royalty, and even presidents … He stresses that often the most significant members of the global powerhierarchy hide behind apparently ‘ordinary’ lives while dictating the agenda andattending human sacrifice rituals. This is what I have found to be true in myown research. However, some public figures are high in the satanic hierarchy, asPhillip Eugene found when he attended their ceremonies:> I can recall the Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals, but never> having the supremacy to lead them. I still regard them as lackeys and not real> brokers of occult power. Except for Alan Greenspan [long-time head of the US> Federal Reserve Bank], most of these fellows were camp followers in the> occult, primarily for the economic power and prestige. Greenspan, I recall,> was a person of tremendous spiritual, occult power and could make the Bushes> and the younger Rockefellers cower with just a glance. Ex-CIA Director Casey> (as were most of the CIA leadership for the past forty years), Kissinger, and> [former US Secretary of State] Warren Christopher were in attendance at> non-ritual gatherings and some occult rituals as well, but well back in the> gallery. There is an important point to make here. In the ‘movie’ version of the worldsold to us by system and media, Alan Greenspan was appointed by the Reagan–BushWhite House to head the Federal Reserve ‘central bank’ in 1987, and wasreconfirmed by presidents Father George Bush, Bill Clinton and Boy George Bushuntil he chose to retire in 2006. We are led to believe that the presidents werethe masters deciding to employ Greenspan, but that’s only in the fake hierarchyfor public consumption and diversion. The Reptilian-satanic hierarchy is whatdecides the real power structure and Greenspan (and his masters) were tellingthe presidents that they were going to appoint and confirm him, not the otherway round. Phillip Eugene added:> At the forefront of the rituals were [the royal families of Europe], Prince> Philip at the pinnacle. He stands, like most of the contemporary European> monarchy, in the Charlemagne, Merovingian, Aenean bloodline. But he is its> current head. I am certain that his maternal chromosomes are in the current> ‘antichrist’ Nephilim. Prince Philip … is the leading biological descendant of> the ‘Reptilians’, as you call them. Immediately below him are the males of my> family line [Rothschilds] like a court of ministers in charge of logistics and> operations. The current monarchs of The Netherlands, Spain and some of the old> Austrian nobility [Habsburgs] are next in occult power and in the conspiracy. I will explain the expansion of the bloodline through history in the nextchapter and it does involve the Charlemagne, Merovingian and Aenean lines amongmany others. The hierarchy is decided by purity of genetics, from the Reptilianpoint of view, and the power of the possessing entities. The ‘human’ hierarchyis really the Reptilian hierarchy in disguise. Stewart Swerdlow describes in hisbook Blue Blood, True Blood, how he witnessed rituals at Montauk on Long Island:> … Many well-known personalities came to participate. Some of these were> political figures, while others were in the media or literary world. I> remember seeing personages that looked like [Holy Grail author] Sir Laurence> Gardner, William F. Buckley, Sean Connery, Spiro Agnew, Henry Kissinger, John> F. Kennedy, Jr., the Shah of Iran, and numerous other actors, military> personnel and Middle Eastern figures, whose names I did not know. All, but> Kennedy and Connery shapeshifted into Reptilian form during the ceremonies. > On most occasions they gorge on fetuses harvested from abortion clinics. They> also had live babies that they held up by the back of the neck. Then, they> slashed its throat from left to right, ear to ear, biting down on the gaping> opening to drink the blood. This was an amazing delicacy to them. Stewart tells how a human sacrifice is terrorised before ‘a final thrust of ablade disembowels the victim, resulting in rivers of blood flowing over thecrowd’s bodies’. He says that the frenzy is so high at this point that manybegin to shapeshift into Reptilians and even attack each other mindlessly. Ihave heard the same descriptions from others who have experienced the rituals.If you have seen the 1998 film, Blade, with Wesley Snipes, you’ll get thepicture. Stewart Swerdlow tells how the sacrifices are ripped apart as theinternal organs and genitalia are consumed:> … The God and Goddess then chant ceremonial invocation to the> [other-dimensional] astral planes. I have heard this chant in Latin, Hebrew,> Ancient Egyptian, Sumerian, German, English and a guttural, hissing language> which I was told is the original Draco language. The ancient Book of Enoch says that those born of Nefilim blood are, because oftheir ‘ancestral spirit’ (Reptilian possession), destined to ‘afflict, oppress,destroy, attack, do battle and work destruction on the Earth’. And they have. Iknow its horrible to think about, but unless we face what is going on it willcontinue. The Reptilian bloodlines with their shapeshifting, blood drinking andhuman sacrifice, are the inspiration for the stories of vampires like Dracula –Draco-ula – written by the Irish author Bram Stoker in 1897. Every part of theworld and every era of history has myths and legends about vampires who feed offother people’s blood. Dracula contains all the familiar themes. His name isDracula (the Draco are claimed to be the ‘royal’ Reptilian bloodlines); he iscalled ‘Count’ Dracula (symbolic of the way these Draco bloodlines have beencarried by ‘human’ royalty and aristocracy); he ‘shapeshifts’ (like theReptilian hybrids) and he is a vampire (symbolic of the need of the Reptiliansto drink human blood). Remember, also, the common theme of the undergroundpeople of folklore being unable to come out in the sunshine – just like Dracula.Many famous writers and artists were initiates or dogged researchers who toldelements of the story through art and ‘fiction’. Stoker’s character was largelybased on a man called Dracula or Vlad the Impaler, the fifteenth century rulerof a country called Wallachia, not far from the Black Sea in what is nowRomania. This region was once called Transylvania, the home of the most famousvampire legends. The Danube River valley, which runs from Germany to Romania andinto the Black Sea, comes up very often in the history of the bloodlines. Vladthe Impaler, or Dracula, slaughtered tens of thousands of people and impaledmany of them on stakes. He would sit down to eat amid this forest of deadbodies, dipping his bread in their blood. The decaying corpses were often leftthere for months. It was once reported that an invading Turkish army turned backin fright when it encountered thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banksof the Danube. In 1461, Mohammed II (Mehmed II), the conqueror ofConstantinople, a man not noted for his squeamishness, was so sickened by thesight of 20,000 impaled corpses rotting outside of Dracula’s capital ofTirgoviste that the warrior sultan turned over command of the campaign againstDracula to subordinates and returned to Constantinople. Vlad the Impaler was theson of Vlad Dracul, who was initiated into the ancient Order of the Dragon bythe Holy Roman Emperor in 1431. Its emblem was a dragon, wings extended, hangingon a cross. Father Vlad wore this emblem and his coinage bore the dragon symbol.All members of the order had a dragon on their coat of arms and he was nicknamedDracul (the Devil or the Dragon). Son Vlad signed his name Draculea, or Draculya– ‘Devil’s Son’. This later became Dracula, a name that translates as somethinglike ‘Son of Him who had the Order of the Dragon’. The ancient Order of theDragon began in Egypt and expanded through the period of the Sumerian Hyksoskings whose symbol was the snake. This is the same Dragon Order that is todaypromoted by the British ‘Holy Grail’ author, Sir Laurence Gardner. By the way,Queen Mary, or Mary of Teck, the mother of King George VI and grandmother to thepresent Elizabeth II, was descended from a sister of Vlad the Impaler –‘Dracula’.Energy vampiresHuman blood is not the only target of these vampires. The Reptilians also feedoff human energy. Italian physicist and writer Giuliana Conforto says thatinterspace planes, the heaven between heavens that Credo Mutwa talks about, donot have a natural energy source like a dimension. They are like neutral zonesand any entities operating in these interspace planes would need to create anenergy source for themselves. And they have – human fear in all its forms. Whenwe feel fear we generate a vibration, an energy field. Every time we think andfeel, no matter what our state of being may be, we are sending out ‘broadcast’waves that vibrate to the frequency of the particular thought or emotion. Wefeel these frequencies coming from people in what we call ‘vibes’. The lowvibration of fear and its associated emotions like anger, aggression, stress andguilt produce frequencies that pour into the interspace plane and this hasbecome the energy source of these Reptilian and other entities. The morehumanity feels fear in all its forms the more energy – power – the Reptiliansand other interspace entities have to sustain them and use back against us. Theentire global system has been designed to generate the energy of fear, stressand suffering and turn the human population into an energy source.In the first of the Matrix movies, the character called Morpheus holds up abattery and says: ‘The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world built to keepus under control in order to change the human being into this’. The majorchildren’s movie called Monsters Inc., released by the Reptilian Disneyorganisation, has the same theme. The ‘monster’ world did not have an energysource and so they walked through ‘doors’ (symbolic of the interdimensionalgateways) into children’s bedrooms in the human world. There they would frightenchildren and, when the kids screamed with fear, the monsters would capture thatenergy in a tube and take it back through the door to power their world. Thehero of the movie was, appropriately, a single eye, a major Reptilian hybridsymbol as we shall see. This fear-generated energy source is one major aspect ofSeptember 11th 2001 and its aftermath that is not acknowledged, because it is sofar from conditioned reality. Look at the fear generated as a result of 9/11,the ‘war on terror’, the two world wars, and a political, financial, business,military and media system that is specifically designed to maintain humanity ina constant state of fear, worry, stress and anger. Sumer (‘Land of theGuardians’) and Babylon (‘Gate of the Gods’) were prime centres for the ‘gods’,and this land ‘Between Two Rivers’ is connected to an interdimensional portal orgateway where it is easier to move between dimensions and absorb the energy fromthis reality. What is that land called today? Iraq. Imagine then how much fearenergy and that of stress and hatred has been triggered by the Reptilianhybrid’s invasion of Iraq and the mass killing that now goes on there every day.From the perspective of life presented to us by the politicians and media, whatis happening in Iraq is a disaster; but for the Reptilians and their agenda itis perfect. The Reptilian hybrids have created a system designed to generatemaximum conflict, fear and stress and they then trawl that energy for their ownsustenance and purposes. The last thing they want us to have is peace, love andharmony. As Alan Walton, a long-time researcher and writer on the Reptilians,said:> These vampirical types [of Reptilian] … actually seek to feed off human> emotional energies and life force/essence in order to acquire the energy that> they apparently need not only to infiltrate our world but also our dimension.> Having genetically engineered themselves along more ‘warrior instinct’ lines,> what little connection they might have had to a ‘spiritual’ side has been all> but eliminated, and they are motivated only by the predatory instinct of their> collective which apparently knows only one agenda: conquer, assimilate,> consume! All this has been confirmed by many abductees, especially in more> recent years. The biblical Nefilim were described in just these terms. Paedophilia is anotherexpression of these energy vampires who especially seek the energy and essenceof children. Paedophiles are possessed by Reptilians, and other demonicentities, and while they are having sex with children the possessing demon isabsorbing the child’s energy from the base chakra at the bottom of the spine –location of the kundalini. So much extreme and horrific behaviour comes from thefact that the perpetrators are possessed in this way.Empathy deletedIt is so important for people not to judge what the Reptilians and their hybridcohorts will do based on the behaviour of the general population. The Reptilianhybrids and their masters have no limits because they have no empathy. A worldof harmony is impossible without empathy, which is defined as ‘understanding andentering into another’s feelings‘. It is this ability to empathise that providesfor self-regulation of human behaviour and allows us to connect emotionally withthe consequences for others of our actions. Think what would happen if there wasno empathy between us. There would be no limits, for no matter how much I madeyou suffer there would be no emotional consequences for me. Your sufferingsimply wouldn’t matter. That’s the major difference between the Reptilians andhumans, and it’s why they can engage in the most sickening behaviour and justlaugh at their victims. I have heard people say that the attacks of 9/11 couldnot have been an inside job because Americans would not do that to otherAmericans. Well, firstly the Reptilian hybrids are not ‘Americans’, except fortheir illusory outer form. They are Reptilians pursuing their agenda for globalconquest in the same way that their associates in other ‘nations’ are doing.Yes, they might fight among themselves, and they do, viciously – that’s thenature of the beast. In the end, however, they are seeking the same outcome ofglobal conquest. Secondly, these entities have no empathy and so three thousanddead people on September 11th, the trauma and misery of their families, and thewell over a million people killed or maimed in the subsequent ‘war on terror’,is irrelevant to them (Figure 57). They just sit back and smile and absorb theenergy of fear and suffering thus produced.Image [../Images/00062.jpg]Figure 57: Millions of Iraqi civilians have been killed or maimed by invasion,civil war and ‘sanctions’ since the 1990s. These include babies born withhorrific birth defects caused by the depleted uranium used in the bombs andshells that pepper the country and pollute the atmosphere with radiation. Butthe Reptilian hybrids will have no problem with this because of their lack ofempathy with the victims of their actions The satanic rituals are not only employed for human sacrifice and blooddrinking. They are also designed to create the energy environment that allowsthe Reptilians to make the transition from their plane into this one. Everythingin this reality is a vibrating energy field and every colour is a uniquefrequency code that the brain reads into red, blue, green, whatever. The coloursused in these rituals, the chanting (vibrational projection), the terror of thevictim and the blood, the prime conduit of human energy, are all vibrationscombined to generate the energy field that allows the Reptilians and otherdemonic entities to transmute into this reality. The Emerald Tablets say: ‘…when the blood was offered, forth came they to dwell among men’. They needenormous amounts of energy to make the transition between frequency fields tomanifest here and we are also unknowingly providing that energy by our mentaland, especially, emotional states. I have talked with people who have seen theseentities manifest at rituals and the participants are terrified of them.The Reptilian hybrids first took over the ancient Mystery schools and theseexpanded into the now vast global secret society network that is used tocovertly manipulate events and put the hybrids and their agents into thepositions of power all over the world. Those initiated into the highestcontrolling and coordinating levels of this network are called the ‘Illuminati’,or Illuminated Ones, which refers to the advanced knowledge given only to thechosen few. Access to the upper levels of the Illuminati is by bloodline onlyand the terms ‘Reptilian bloodlines’ and ‘Illuminati bloodlines’, or families,are interchangeable. Among the major groups coodinated by the Illuminati are theJesuits, Opus Dei, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar and the Freemasons; butthere are countless others that connect the elite initiates of all thereligions, as well as governments, corporations and media owners, etc. The upperechelons of this network, and many lower levels come to that, also connect intothe network that we know as Satanism. Indeed, the Illuminati and Satanism areindivisible, two expressions of the same force. This is why I name so manyfamous people in my other books for being Satanists and engaging in humansacrifice and blood drinking rituals. Those in major positions of royal,political, banking, commercial, media and military power are invariably theReptilian hybrids and they have always performed these rituals. Power andSatanism, therefore, go together.The prime Reptilian families know who and what they are and they bring up theirchildren to enter the ‘family business’. The Reptilian genetic codes have to beactivated or they stay dormant and have no affect on behaviour. You might have aprogram on the hard drive of your PC, but if it is never accessed it won’taffect the computer’s reality. You have to click it open first. I have met manyoffspring from Reptilian bloodline families who are lovely people with openhearts, and they betray none of the traits so prevalent in others of theirlineage. Some are actively rebelling against the manipulation and showing greatcourage in doing so. If the Reptilian file is not opened there is no effect,and, even if it is opened, it can be overridden by someone who is trulyconscious. The Reptilian families who know who they are bring up their childrenwith the specific aim of ‘opening the file’. They are also constantly targetingthose who have the hybrid codes, but have no idea that this is the case. Theyhave their techniques to establish who has the codes and now they are seeking tomake it far easier by creating a global DNA database under the guise of‘fighting crime and terrorism’. In Britain, we now have a law, thanks toReptilian hybrid lackey, Tony Blair, that allows police to take a DNA sample ofeveryone arrested. This is kept on file even if they are found to be innocentand this will be extended across Europe. Laws like this seem ridiculous andoutrageous unless you know why they are really being introduced and, of course,the police officers actually imposing them have no clue of what it’s all about.They just follow orders and ‘the law’ – Draconian law.The Reptilian hybrids are particularly interested in ‘encoded’ people withskills that could be useful to them, and their targets might be pursuing acareer in politics, banking, business, law, entertainment, anything that can beused to manipulate the population. Suddenly, the targets find that powerfulpeople come into their lives and support and sponsor their careers. To them, atfirst, it will appear that the sponsors believe in their abilities, buteventually the fishing line is reeled in. The targets are pulled deeper into thelair and they join the secret societies essential to career progress in so manyprofessions. They take part in the initiation ceremonies that seem to be justmumo-jumbo when, in fact, they are designed to activate the Reptilian codes.Slowly at first, and then rapidly, they are switched from their human toreptilian genetics and go through personality changes that they don’t recognise,but others who knew them before will see. As these codes are activated, theinterspace Reptilians are able to influence more and more of their behaviouruntil they are taken over completely. This has been happening throughout thepost-Flood period as the Reptilians have seized ever greater power, and they nowhave a global reach But, ironically, the Reptilians and their hybrid clones areterrified of humans; terrified of being exposed and losing their energy source.Behind their arrogant façade, they are constantly in a blind panic, becausetheir domination is 100 per cent dependent on humanity remaining in a comatosestate and not seeing the prison that entraps them. I am understandably askedwhy, if they are all-powerful, they don’t just openly take over. The answer isthat they can’t – or they would. There are few of them compared with the humanpopulation and once humans know of their existence, and their means ofsustenance, their restaurant order will be in danger of being cancelled. Notbeing able to live in the Sun, which many of them can’t, doesn’t help, either.Their only means of seizing control is to do it covertly, in the way I amdescribing.There’s another thing, too. The Reptilians are themselves controlled by anotherforce, which Stewart Swerdlow mentioned when he said they were created by‘transparent people’ who ‘cannot really enter into the physical dimensionsbecause their energy vibratory rate is so high that it cannot sustain a physicalbody’. When they appear, he says, ‘it looks like a transparent glass shell’. BoyGeorge Bush to a tee. The Reptilians themselves are computer programs encoded todo what they are doing, and the ultimate power over their behaviour and humanmanipulation is beyond them. In the end, he who controls the Matrix controlshuman and Reptilian reality – unless we become conscious and stop playing itssilly games.When I first started talking and writing about the Reptilian connection I facedmuch ridicule and abuse, but minds are opening ever faster. I put ‘Reptilianextraterrestrials’ into Netfind before the publication of The Biggest Secret in1998 and only a handful of pages came up. I did the same today and there weremore than 33,000 – and this is a fraction of what it will become as the veilcontinues to lift."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 5 Serpent and the Sun > Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from> religious conviction. > Blaise Pascal The Reptilian hybrid bloodlines were seeded throughout the world, but those thatemerged out of the Sumer Empire and Babylon (now Iraq) have been most visible intheir quest for global domination. It is they who are largely in power today.The British writer and anthropologist, L.A. Waddell, produced a series ofbrilliant books about Sumer and other ancient cultures. He was an expert inSumerian and Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Sanskrit language of the IndusValley in India. This was a rare gift indeed and it allowed him to travel theseregions, reading the ancient accounts on the temples and monuments, and see thatSumer, Egypt and the Indus Valley were parts of one empire based on Sumer.Waddell also shows in his work, Makers of Civilisation, that the Sumer-centredEmpire extended not only to the Indus Valley in the east, but to the BritishIsles in the west and encompassed much in between. It was larger than that ofAlexander the Great or the Romans. It could be that the advanced knowledge wentinto Sumer via the Indus Valley with the Reptilians fleeing from the sunkenMu/Lemuria, but once there, it seems, Sumer was the centre. Waddell discoveredfrom the timelines and descriptions of the leaders and their genealogy, that therulers of these three great cultures, Sumer, Egypt and the Indus Valley were, atleast in one period, the same people under different names. It is the differentnames that have obscured the truth. Historians have taken different names tomean different people, but this is not correct. The endless ‘gods’ in thevarious cultures also turn out to be different names for the same deities. Onceyou understand this, wading through the ‘past’ becomes a lot less complicated.The advantage that Waddell had over conventional Egyptologists and ‘historians’(apart from an open mind) was that he could read Sumerian and could decipherinscriptions in Egypt which they could not understand. He could see that earlyEgyptian hieroglyphics were those used by their ruling culture in Sumer. It wasonly later that they evolved into an Egyptian system developed more locally. Itis the latter that Egyptologists have been decoding.Here is one example of how Waddell proved his point. The Sumerians recorded thatKing Sargon had a son called Manis, who later became emperor. At the same time,Waddell shows, the son of the king in the Indus Valley was known as Manja, whilein Egypt he was called Manj (abbreviated to Man) – the guy known to the Greeksas Menes and to English Egyptologists as Mena. We have the ruler’s son, andlater ruler, during the same period in Sumer, Egypt and the Indus Valley calledvariously, Manis, Manj and Manja. The reason becomes obvious: it was the samebloke. Even the title given to him was the same, or very similar, in all threeplaces. In Egypt, he was known as Manj-the-Warrior; in Sumer he wasManis-the-Warrior; and in the Indus Valley he was called Manja-the-Shooter. Hisfather, Sargon the Great, is a Semitic name for the Sumerian-Mesopotamianemperor, King Gin, Gani, or Guni. The Sumer Empire was so large that in thelater Babylonian texts he is called the ‘King of the Four Quarters of theWorld’. The Incas of South America also used this term ‘Four Quarters’. In theancient Indian epics, Sargon’s son, Manja, was called ‘The Royal Eye of Goptaand of the Four Ends of the Earth’ when he became emperor. The symbolism of the‘Eye of Gopta’ may relate to the widely used Reptilian hybrid symbol of theAll-Seeing-Eye, or Eye of Horus, which you will find at the top of the pyramidon the US dollar Bill and on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States(Figure 58), and in the portrayal of that ‘eye’ character in Monsters Inc. Inthe Indus Valley clay seal records, Sargon and Manja, or Menes, calledthemselves and their dynasty Gut or Got (‘Goth’ to the Romans). In the IndusValley, they also used the titles Bar or Par, which means ‘pharaoh’, accordingto Waddell. Gut or Got became ‘God’, a term used by the later Goths. Allnon-Latin languages in Europe are derived from the Gothic, including English,and the ancient Swedish language is still called ‘Sueo-Gothic’. The former namefor Denmark was ‘Goth-land’ and a derivative was Jut-land. Gothic architecture,so beloved of the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines, comes from the same source and sodoes the horned headgear worn by the kings and leaders of European tribes andkingdoms. These symbols, styles and customs go back much further to thetechnologically advanced global civilisations known as Atlantis, Lemuria or Mu.The Knights Templar, a major Reptilian hybrid secret society, employed the‘Gothic’ style of architecture when they built the great ‘Christian’ cathedralsof Europe, which are full of Sumerian/Babylonian symbolism and located onancient Pagan sacred sites. The symbols used by the ancient Sumerian, Babylonianand Egyptian dynasties are still used today by the Reptilian hybrid secretsocieties, because they are the same bloodlines and they are working with thesame knowledge, hidden away since ancient times within the Mystery school andsecret society networks.Image [../Images/00063.jpg]Figure 58: The ancient Reptilian hybrid symbol of the Pyramid and All-Seeing-Eyeon the dollar bill of the Reptilian-controlled United States The Sumer ‘exodus’Thanks to their empire, the Sumerians travelled and located in near and far-awaylands in many parts of the world, taking their bloodline, religion and knowledgewith them. Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa told me of the accounts of the people of‘Sumaru’, the biblical Shinar, or Sumer, who arrived in South Africa andinterbred with the native population. The descriptions of them are the same asthose of Sumerians. When the Sumer Empire ended in the period up to 2000 BC,Egypt and the Indus Valley went their own way, but with the same knowledge baseand belief systems. Other peoples and empires followed in Mesopotamia, theAkkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian and Chaldean among them. These also inherited theknowledge-base, history, bloodlines and ways of the Sumerians. The BabylonianEmpire from 2000 BC to around 1600 BC became a heart centre of the Reptilianhybrids in that region and so much of the modern world came out of Babylon andother Mesopotamian societies. The hybrid bloodlines that emerged from theselands established themselves in ancient Troy, Greece, Rome and elsewhere, oftenreconnecting with the bloodlines of Sumer that had travelled before them, andinterbred with native peoples far and wide to expand the reach of the hybridDNA. The Reptilian political, financial and religious structure was imposedwherever the bloodlines located.One of the major Reptilian hybrid bloodlines came down through the Merovingiankings in what is now France and Germany. Books like The Holy Blood and the HolyGrail, and the Dan Brown novel, The Da Vinci Code, have brought the Merovingiandynasty into public consciousness, along with secret societies like Opus Dei andthe Knights Templar, and linked them to the ‘secret’ of the ‘bloodline ofJesus’. The tale goes that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and they had achild. It is claimed that mother and daughter fled Palestine after thecrucifixion and travelled to what became France. Here, it is said, the bloodlineresurfaced as the Merovingian kings. The story has made a lot of money for a lotof people, but a story is all it is, not least because there was no literalJesus or Mary Magdalene. The Merovingians are, however, a Reptilian bloodline ofserious significance. They ruled lands that became France and Germany from the5th to the 8th century AD. They were known as the ‘sorcerer kings’ or ‘priestkings’, as were the pharaohs in Egypt and indeed other Reptilian hybrid royalfamilies. The term ‘priest kings’ refers to those who are both of the Reptilianbloodline and carry the advanced knowledge. The Merovingians were the royal lineof a people known as the Sicambrian Franks, later the Franks, hence ‘France’.Their alleged founder, Francio, who died in 11BC, claimed to be a descendant ofNoah (the Reptilian hybrid Flood-hero recorded by the Sumerians under anothername). The Franks called themselves ‘Newmage’, or ‘the People of the Covenant’.The Egyptians also believed they were the chosen people and had a covenant withGod (the gods), and the theme continued with the Jewish faith that also came outof Sumer and Babylon. This theme of the ‘chosen people’ can be found all overthe world and it relates to the DNA connection with the Reptilian ‘gods’although few are aware of this.Image [../Images/00064.jpg]Figure 59: The migration of people in the thousands of years after the break upof the Sumer Empire Image [../Images/00065.jpg]Figure 60: The beehive symbol of the Merovingian bloodline on the state seal ofUtah, home to the Mormon religion created by the Merovingian bloodline The peoples of the Sumer and Babylon Empires migrated in all directions,particularly north into Europe, with history recording them under differentnames at different times (Figure 59). The Merovingian/Franks migration came outof Sumer and located in ancient Troy (in today’s Turkey), scene of the TrojanWars, which are normally dated at between 1300 BC and 1200 BC. The Franks tracedtheir bloodline from here, up through the Caucasus Mountains between the Blackand Caspian seas, and eventually into what is now France. Prince Paris from theTrojan War stories inspired the name of the French capital city. At one time,the Sicambrian Franks settled in an area west of the Danube and were known asthe Scythians, whom the Romans called ‘the genuine ones’. Legend says thatMerovee, the founder of the Merovingians, who died in 458 AD, was seeded by areptile and this bloodline is apparently related to every royal family in Europeand a long list of others in positions of influence and control. The foundingnames of the Reptilian hybrid Mormon Church, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young,were both Merovingian bloodline, and that’s why the Mormon-controlled state ofUtah has a beehive at the centre of its seal (Figure 60). The bee, or beehive,is an ancient symbol of the Merovingian bloodline, as is the fleur-de-lis, sobeloved of British Merovingian royalty (Figure 61). The hive is the symbol ofthe queen bee and it also relates to the ‘hive’ mentality of the Reptilians. Thepapal ‘triple tiara’ is the same symbolism (Figure 62, overleaf). TheFleur-de-lis is a version of Babylonian Trinity that became the ‘Christian’Trinity. The works of the Greek poet, Homer, who lived around the 9th or 8thcentury BC, are the main source of information about ancient Troy and theconflicts that led to its demise. The two epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, areascribed to him and modern archaeological discoveries have confirmed theaccuracy of Homer’s work. According to the Iliad, the founder of Troy was namedDardanus. He was said to be the son of the god Zeus, whose symbols were theserpent, eagle and bees. Dardanus had a son named Erichthonius, and his son wascalled Tros, who gave his name to the Trojans and their capital city, Troy, fromwhom the bee-symboled Merovingians claim descent. Trois is the French word for‘three’ and this is an extremely important number to the Reptilian hybrids, asin the Trinity. Tros had a son called Assaracus, and a prince of the royal houseof Assaracus is credited with founding the Roman Empire. His name was Aeneas andthis guy seems to be extremely important to the bloodline, as Phillip Eugene deRothschild indicated earlier.Image [../Images/00066.jpg]Figure 61: The Merovingian trinity symbol, the Fleur-de-lis Image [../Images/00067.jpg]Figure 62: A Vatican statue with the Papal ‘beehive’ Tiara and the rising Sunsymbol of the Reptilian hybrids The Merovingians are associated with Arcadia in Greece, home of the Spartans,one of the protagonists in the Trojan Wars. (The Akkadian Empire, slightlydifferent spelling, but virtually the same sound, was another of theMesopotamian civilisations and the name originated from the Sumerian language).Some Spartans migrated to Troy and up into France, settling in the province ofLorraine, a long time major centre for the Reptilian hybrid elite right to thepresent day, especially through the Habsburg dynasty. In the apocryphal book 1Maccabees, a letter from Areus, King of Sparta, tells a Jewish High Priest thatthe Spartans are ‘… of the race of Abraham’ – the race of Sumer. The biblical‘Abraham’ is said to have come from the land of Shinar, the Bible’s name forSumer. The Merovingians were supposed to have died out long ago, but in realityonly the name disappeared, until recently, and not the bloodline. After theMerovingian period, the Reptilian-hybrid genetics continued to rule in the landsthat became France and Germany thanks to the King of the Franks called Charles,more famously known as Charlemagne, to whom a host of US presidents and manyother key figures are related. He extended the Frankish domains and ruled asEmperor of the West in the papal empire created and controlled by the bloodlinesdescending from Rome. These, in turn, descended from the royal lines of theSumer Empire, Babylon and Egypt, who descended from the Lemurians, Atlanteansand the hybrid interbreeding programmes. Another of the major figures inReptilian hybrid genealogy is Alexander the Great, an ancestor of Charlemagneand all the major bloodline families today. Alexander descended from the Vikingpeoples who settled the Mediterranean and the Aegean region after the GreatFlood. Alexander ruled Troy at one stage and, before he died in Babylon in 323BC at the age of 33, his army had seized control of an enormous region onceruled from Sumer. This included Egypt, Mesopotamia and into India. Alexander wascalled the ‘Serpent’s Son’ and when he founded the city of Alexandria in Egyptit became known as the ‘City of the Serpent’s Son’. Once again we see therecurring theme. The legend goes that Alexander’s real father was the serpentgod, Ammon, and this mirrors the story of Merovee, founder of the Merovingiandynasty, of whom a similar origin is given. Phillip Eugene de Rothschild says ofthese prime Reptilian bloodlines:> Apparently Aeneas [Troy] embodies all the various bloodlines that must trace> their lineage back through Charlemagne because in him is embodied the> confluence of the lineage of both David (Jewish) and Alexander the Great> (Aryan). It is the modern day representatives of these Roman ‘Gens’, or> European monarchs, that make up the ruling ‘aristocracy’ of the revived Roman> Empire. These ‘royal’ families maintain their pedigree through endogamy> [inter-family marriages]. The first prototype of the Antichrist [the purest> bloodline] was Nimrod, founder of Babylon. The historical and seminal nexus of> this last Roman Empire is Charlemagne and his descendants, people like> [Prince] Philip Mountbatten (Rex Julius Alexander Battenberg) who is one of> the ruling heads of the Julian Gens. Reptilian RomeMention of Nimrod and Rome brings us to a very important part of Reptilianhybrid history that will lead us to the present day. According to ancient textsand legend, Nimrod was the founder of Babylon, which followed Sumer in what isnow Iraq, and he is said to have reigned with his wife, Queen Semiramis. She isanother version of the Indian deity, Sami-Rama-isi or Semi-Ramas. Nimrod (whichmeans ‘We Shall Rebel’) was described as a ‘mighty tyrant’, a ‘great hunter’ andone of the ‘giants’. The race of ‘giants’ or ‘Titans’ was said to have beendescendants of Noah, the baby described in the Book of Enoch as being aWatcher-human hybrid with extremely white skin. The father of Nimrod in the textof Genesis was Cush, also known as Bel or Belus, who was the grandson of Noahand son of Ham. Cush became known as the deity, Hermes, which means Son of Ham.I featured the ‘Caduceus of Hermes’ earlier, and symbols for Nimrod in Babylonincluded the snake and serpent, or dragon. The Arabs believed that after theFlood it was Nimrod who built, or rebuilt, the amazing structure at Baalbek inthe Lebanon with its three stones, each weighing 800 tons. It was said that heruled the region that is now Lebanon and, according to Genesis, the firstcentres of Nimrod’s kingdom were Babylon, Akkad and others in the land of Shinar(Sumer). He is also said to have ruled Assyria and built cities like Nineveh,where many of the Sumerian Tablets were found. Even a brief look at how Nimrodand company were worshipped in Babylon should become immediately familiar. TheBabylonians worshipped the trinity of Nimrod, the father god, symbolised as afish; Tammuz or Ninus, the virgin-born son, who was said to be a reincarnationof Nimrod, so ‘father and son were one’; and Queen Semiramis or Ishtar, thevirgin mother, who was symbolised as a dove. I have definitely heard thatsomewhere before. Give me a minute, I’m sure it will come.After the demise of Sumer and Babylon and the decline of Egypt, the Reptilianhybrid headquarters eventually relocated to the seven hills of Rome, whichbecame the centre of an enormous empire that founded the ‘Christian’ Church.Legend says that the city was named by a guy called Romulus who was abandoned onthe banks of the River Tiber with his twin brother Remus. They were described as‘sons of the god Mars’ – this was the god known as Marduk in Sumer and Nimrod inBabylon. The Sumerian Tablets say that Marduk was the son of Enki, the chiefscientist of the Anunnaki, so connecting Enki with the Babylonian Nimrod. Thelegend goes that Romulus and Remus had an argument over who should be ruler and,after Romulus killed Remus, he named the city, Rome. Other accounts say that theroyal line of Troy, which produced the Merovingians, was also seeded into whatbecame the rulers of the Roman Empire. It is said that after Troy was sacked,the Trojan War hero, Aeneas, the ‘son of Prince Anchises and the goddessAphrodite’ (the Babylonian Semiramis/Ishtar), travelled to present day Italy andfounded the culture that would become Rome. This is described in The Aeneid, awork by the Roman known to history as ‘Virgil’, and compiled from around 27 BC.The mythology detailed by Virgil says Romulus and Remus were both descendants ofAeneas through their mother Aphrodite – the same mother symbolically accorded toAeneas, who is an important figure in both Greek and Roman history. We aretalking the bloodlines of Sumer and Babylon again when it comes to the foundersof Rome. It is said that Aeneas went to Italy, via Carthage (today’s Tunis inNorth Africa) with his son Ascanius. They were received by King Latinus andeventually Aeneas became King of Italy, then called Latium. His son, Ascanius,married Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus, and their son, Sylvius, marriedLavinia’s niece. They, in turn, had a son named Brutus who became the greatgrandson of Aeneas. It was Brutus, some accounts claim, who landed in theBritish Isles in 1,103 BC, renaming it ‘Britain’ and the people ‘Britons’. Hebuilt a city called ‘New Troy’, today’s London, the accounts suggest, but thesereports are widely dismissed. Whatever, here we have the bloodline coming out ofTroy to seed into what became the Roman royal and elite bloodlines, and also theTrojan origins of the Merovingian kings and Charlemagne in what is now Franceand Germany. Remember what Phillip Eugene de Rothschild said:> At the forefront of the rituals were [the royal families of Europe], Prince> Philip at the pinnacle. He stands, like most of the contemporary European> monarchy, in the Charlemagne, Merovingian, Aenean bloodline. But he is its> current head. I am certain that his maternal chromosomes are in the current> ‘antichrist’ Nephilim. Prince Philip … is the leading biological descendant of> the ‘Reptilians’, as you call them. Whatever the truth among the myth in the founding of Rome, and much of it willbe symbolic, this culture and its subsequent empire were Babylon relocated. Itwas another Reptilian society with its attitude of see-want-conquer, and wastypified by the Coliseum where millions of people and animals were slaughteredfor the ‘entertainment’ of the spectators. The Roman Empire would further expandthe influence of the Reptilian hybrids, while allowing interbreeding with thosefrom the Sumer Empire who had gone before them.The Reptilian religionsThe Romans also created Christianity as we know it today, and the endlessReptilian religions, each based on the Church of Babylon, have been one of thegreatest weapons of global mind control and spiritual repression. The majorreligions have all come from the lands of the Sumer Empire. Christianity,Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and others, like Zoroasterism, all emergedfrom the Middle and Near East and the region ruled at one time from Sumer. Theyhave continued to be dominated by that knowledge base and belief system in thethousands of years that have followed Sumer’s demise. As I said a littleearlier, a story about King Sargon, the Akkadian king who conquered Sumer, saidthat his mother bore him in secret and floated him in a basket on the RiverEuphrates where he was found and brought up by the royal family. TheIsraelite/Hebrews, or rather their manipulating priests, later took this ancientstory from the Mesopotamian accounts and used it in the make-believe story ofMoses. The Old Testament is founded on Sumerian, Babylonian and Egyptianaccounts, edited and rewritten as required, to create a manufactured history andreligion called Judaism. The New Testament is based on symbolic stories repeatedover and over in the thousands of years before it was compiled, and these relateto a large extent to the Sumerian, Babylonian and Egyptian religion of Sunworship and Mystery school rituals. The New Testament texts, in turn, created amanufactured religion and history called Christianity. King Sargon was a majorSun worshipper and these rulers of the Sumer Empire were given the title, ‘Sonof the Sun’. Stewart Swerdlow confirms my own research from his insiderexperience that Sun god worship (and goddess worship) is the Reptilian religion.To the Sumerians, the Sun was a symbol of ‘God’ and, from this, came the titleSon of the Sun or Son of God. This may have something to do with the Reptiliansin ancient texts being said to ‘shine like the Sun’, although the same deitiesand rituals can be used to symbolise many different things, depending on theknowledge the person has access to. You can worship the Sun because it provideswarmth and makes your crops grow, or you can use it to symbolise very advancedenergetic and geometrical ‘laws’. It may be the same symbol, but the twoknowledge levels are vastly different.. Sumerian emperors were also often knownas ‘The One Lord’, and you find the same theme in Egypt, because the twocultures were essentially as one.Christianity is the Babylonian religion of Sun worship and goddess worship indisguise, or disguise for those who choose not to research and see the obvious.The Babylonian Trinity of Nimrod, the father; Tammuz, the virgin-born son (the‘reincarnated Nimrod’); and Semiramis, the virgin mother, was transposed intoRoman belief. It eventually became Christianity and the ‘Christian’ Trinitythanks to Emperor Constantine in the fourth century. The Babylonian Trinitycontinued as the ‘Christian’ Father (Nimrod), Son (Tammuz, renamed Jesus) andHoly Ghost or Holy Spirit, which, like Semiramis in Babylon, is symbolised as adove. All the attributes that the Babylonians gave to Semiramis – ‘VirginMother’, ‘Queen of Heaven’, ‘Our Lady’ (which translates as Madonna and NotreDame) were transferred by the ‘Christian’ creators to Mother Mary. In short, the‘Pagan’ religion of Babylon and the ancient world moved to Rome to be renamed‘Christianity’. ‘Mother Mary’ and ‘Jesus’ in the Nativity scene in St Peter’sSquare in Rome in Figure 63 is really Queen Semiramis and Tammuz from Babylonand throughout the pre-Christian world under many and various names (Figure 64,overleaf). The Ubaid culture, which preceded Sumer in Mesopotamia, worshippedserpent people as we have seen, and reptilian mother and child figures werefound in their graves. There was no Jesus and Mary, or any ‘Christian’ story astold in the Gospels and the pulpits. They are symbolic of the Babylonian deitiesNimrod/Tammuz and Semiramis and the ancient religion of the Reptilian hybrids.As Phillip Eugene de Rothschild said earlier: ‘The first prototype of theAntichrist [the purest bloodline] was Nimrod, founder of Babylon’. Nimrod wasdescribed as a ‘giant’, like the Nefilim, and both he and Semiramis weredepicted as half-human, half-reptile.Image [../Images/00068.jpg]Figure 63: The Nativity scene in St Peter’s Square in Rome, starring QueenSemiramis as ‘Mother Mary’ and Tammuz as ‘Jesus’ Image [../Images/00069.jpg]Figure 64: Mother goddesses everywhere – all of them different versions ofSemiramis in Babylon, who is depicted on the left Unravelling the story is much simpler once you realise that all the differentnames for gods and goddesses around the world are basically the same deities.Among the aliases of Semiramis are Isis, Aphrodite, Venus, Artemis, Diana,Athena, Minerva, Demeter, Ceres, Gaea, Terra, Hera, Juno, Hestia, Vesta, Cybele,Europa, Fortuna, and Rhea or Ops, the wife and sister of the Greek horned-godKronos (Nimrod). Other names for Nimrod/Tammuz include Osiris/Horus, Baal, Bel,Molech (worshipped at Bohemian Grove), Marduk, Saturn, Jupiter, Janus, Merodach,and Pan. Nimrod was ‘the god of the Sun and father of creation’. Semiramisbecame the goddess of the Moon, fertility and much else. The ancient Greekhistorian, Herodotus, told how he saw the Mystery religion and its ritespracticed in many countries and he said that Babylon was the source from whichall ‘idolatry’ came. Sir Austen Henry Layard, one of the leading Britisharchaeologists of the 19th century, who unearthed the Sumerian Tablets, said:‘We have the united testimony of sacred and profane history that idolatryoriginated in the area of Babylonia – the most ancient of religious systems’.The Babylonian Mystery religion became Christianity through the establishment ofthe Roman Church. Not only does the whole foundation of the ‘Christian’ storycome from Babylon and Sumer thousands of years earlier, so do the ‘Christian’holy days and ‘Christian’ festivals like Christmas, Easter and Lent. Christianseven worship on Sunday because ‘Christianity’ is the worship of the Sun god –Nimrod/Tammuz – in the form of Jesus. The Jews have their Sabbath on Saturday,or Saturn-day, in another form of Nimrod worship (Figure 65). In theBabylonian/Chaldean mysteries, Nimrod was deified as Saturn. His birthday wascelebrated during the festival of Saturnalia in the period up to our Christmas,and Rome was even called at one time ‘The City of Saturn’. The inner elite ofthe Christian and Jewish religions know this, but the lower men in frocks andthe wider congregation are sold a cover story. What the elite know to besymbolic in terms of Jesus and so much else, the followers and lower rankingpriesthood are told to take literally under threat of damnation. The RomanChurch was created as a front for the Babylonian religion behind which could behidden the real agenda for global control, not least the control of the minds ofthe masses through religious indoctrination based on the fear of not believing.Image [../Images/00070.jpg]Figure 65: A depiction of the god, ‘Saturn’ (Nimrod). Nice. The symbols of Babylon and its Sun/goddess worship are everywhere in‘Christianity’. The circle of St Peter’s Square in Rome, with its eight rays,represents the goddess, Semiramis, or Ishtar, and the obelisk in the centre isNimrod (Figure 66). The original Egyptian obelisk and the Babylonian-inspiredChristmas tree towered above the Nativity scene when I was in Rome in 2007(Figure 67). Emperor Caligula transported the obelisk from Egypt in the firstcentury and erected it in the Caligula Circus (later the ‘Nero Circus’, or thebrilliantly appropriate ‘Vatican Circus’), and it was moved to its present sitein 1586. The ancient Greek historian, Diodorus, reports that Queen Semiramiserected a 130-foot obelisk in Babylon and it was associated with Sun worship andrepresented the phallus of the Sun god Baal/Nimrod. Some Masonic researchers saythat the word ‘obelisk’ literally means ‘Baal’s shaft’ or ‘Baal’s organ ofreproduction’. It is for this reason that the obelisk also represents theReptilian hybrid bloodlines which are, let’s be honest, a bunch of dicks. TheEgyptian stories about the Sun god, Osiris, say that he was cut into 14 pieceswhich were scattered around the kingdom. His wife, the virgin mother, Isis,found them all except for his penis, and so she made a false one symbolised bythe obelisk. The same story was told of Nimrod and Semiramis in Babylon and thisis why you find the secret societies, especially Freemasonry, erecting obelisksall over the place. It is no accident that the major Reptilian hybrid centres ofRome, London, Paris and New York all have original Egyptian obelisks, nor thatWashington DC has the biggest obelisk in the world, the Freemasonic WashingtonMonument (Figure 68).Image [../Images/00071.jpg]Figure 66: St Peter’s Square and the Vatican are full of Babylonian and esotericsymbolism Image [../Images/00072.jpg]Figure 67: The original Egyptian obelisk, the Christmas tree and the Nativityscene. A montage from the ancient world long before ‘Christianity’ Image [../Images/00073.jpg]Figure 68: The original Egyptian obelisk called Cleopatra’s Needle in London …the original obelisk in New York’s Central Park, also known as Cleopatra’sNeedle … the original obelisk from Luxor in the Place de la Concorde in Paris …and the Washington Monument in Washington DC The Suns of GodThe ‘Christian’ Christmas was the Babylonian – ‘Pagan’ – mid-winter festival andcommemorated the death of Nimrod/Tammuz, representing the Sun which ‘dies’ atthe winter solstice when it reaches the lowest point of its power in thenorthern hemisphere. Three days later, on what became our December 25th, theycelebrated the ‘birth’ of the Sun (Nimrod/Tammuz), hence that was the ‘birthday’given to ‘Jesus’, another Sun symbol. Our December 25th was Rome’s Natalis SolisInvicti – the Birth of the Unconquered Sun – and there were a stream of ‘Jesus’figures in the thousands of years before Christianity. These include Osiris andHorus (Egypt); Mithra/Mithras (Persia and Rome); Dionysus or Bacchus (known asthe ‘Serpent Son’ in Greece/Rome); Attis of Phrygia (now Turkey); Krishna(India) and of course Tammuz, or Ninus, in Babylon. Among others are BuddhaSakia of India; Salivahana of Bermuda; Odin of Scandinavia; Crite of Chaldea;Zoroaster of Persia; Baal and Taut of Phoenicia; Indra of Tibet; Bali ofAfghanistan; Jao of Nepal; Wittoba of Bilingonese; Xamolxis of Thrace; Zoar ofthe Bonzes; Adad of Assyria; Deva Tat and Sammonocadam of Siam; Alcides ofThebes; Mikado of the Sintoos; Beddru of Japan; Hesus or Eros, and Bremrillahm,of the Druids; Thor, son of Odin, of the Gauls; Cadmus of Greece; Hil and Fetaof Mandaites; Gentaut and Quetzalcoatl of Mexico; Universal Monarch of theSibyls; Ischy of Formosa; Holy One of Xaca; Fohi and Tien of China; Adonis, sonof virgin Io, of Greece; Ixion and Quirinus of Rome; and Prometheus of theCaucasus. Here are just two examples of what was said about the Sun deities longbefore ‘Jesus’: > Attis of Phrygia> He was born on our December 25th of the Virgin Nana.> He was considered the saviour who was slain for the salvation of mankind.> His body was symbolised as bread and was eaten by worshippers.> His priests were ‘eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’.> He was both the Divine Son and Father.> On ‘Black Friday’, he was crucified on a tree, from which his holy blood ran> down to redeem the Earth.> He descended into the underworld and, after three days, he was resurrected on> March 25th as the ‘Most High God’. > Dionysus, Bacchus> Dionysus was born of a virgin on our December 25th and, as the Holy Child, was> placed in a manger.> He was a travelling teacher who performed miracles.> He ‘rode in a triumphal procession on an ass’.> He was a sacred king killed and eaten in an eucharistic ritual for fecundity> and purification.> Dionysus rose from the dead on March 25th – Easter.> He was the God of the Vine and turned water into wine.> He was called ‘King of Kings’ and ‘God of Gods’.> He was considered the ‘Only Begotten Son’, ‘Saviour’, ‘Redeemer’, ‘Sin> Bearer’, Anointed One’, and the ‘Alpha and Omega’.> He was identified with the ram or lamb.> His sacrificial title of ‘Dendrites’ or ‘Young Man of the Tree’ intimates he> was hung on a tree or crucified.Most of these ‘sons of God’, or ‘prophets’, and the mind-prison religionsfounded in their names, come from the lands of the Sumer Empire and they are the‘outer’ and literal expression of rituals performed covertly in the secretsocieties, where the high initiates know how to read the same ‘religious’stories symbolically. Mithra, the Sun god of Persia and Rome, was an example ofthe way the inner and outer religions worship the same deity from a differentlevel of knowledge. Mithra was said to have been born to a virgin on ourDecember 25th, crucified to save the peoples’ sins, and raised from the dead onMarch 25th – Easter. Mithran Mystery school initiations took place in cavesadorned with the signs of Capricorn and Cancer, symbolic of the winter andsummer solstices, the high and low points of the Sun. Mithra was often portrayedas a winged lion, a symbol for the Sun still used by the secret societies todayand a major symbol of the Reptilian hybrids like the British Royal Family.References to the lion and the ‘grip of the lion’s paw’ in the Master MasonDegree of Freemasonry originate with this same stream of Mystery schoolsymbolism. Initiates into the rites of Mithra were called lions and were markedon their foreheads with the Egyptian cross. The first degree initiates had agolden crown placed on their heads, representing their spiritual self. Thiscrown of the Mysteries symbolised the rays of the Sun and enlightenment, and‘illumination’ is one of the origins of the ‘royal’ crown. Mithra was said to bethe son (Sun) of god who died to save humanity and give them eternal life. Hewas called the good shepherd and the vine. One classic symbol of Mithra was as alion with a snake curled around his body while he holds the key to heaven. Thisis more Babylonian symbolism and the origin of the story of St Peter, one of the‘12 disciples’ of ‘Jesus’, who is supposed to hold the keys to heaven. ‘Peter’was the name of the High Priest in the Babylon Mystery School. After an initiateof the Mithran cult had completed the ritual, the members had a meal of breadand wine in which they believed they were eating the flesh of Mithra anddrinking his blood. Mithra, like a long list of pre-Christian gods, was said tohave been visited by wise men at his birth who brought him gifts of gold,frankincense and myrrh. The same was said by Plato of his teacher Socrates inancient Greece.The Egyptian deity, Horus, is also worshipped by Christianity as ‘Jesus’ andfollowed by the secret societies under the original name. Horus was the ‘son’ ofGod in Egypt and the connections are devastating for the credibility of theChristian Church: Jesus was the Light of the World, Horus was the Light of theWorld. Jesus said he was the way, the truth and the life, Horus said he was thetruth, the life. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the ‘house of bread’, Horus wasborn in Annu, the ‘place of bread’. Jesus was the Good Shepherd, Horus was theGood Shepherd. Seven fishers board a boat with Jesus, seven people board a boatwith Horus. Jesus was the lamb, Horus was the lamb. Jesus is identified with across, Horus is identified with a cross. Jesus was baptised at 30, Horus wasbaptised at 30. Jesus was the child of a virgin, Mary, Horus was the child of avirgin, Isis. The birth of Jesus was marked by a star, the birth of Horus wasmarked by a star. Jesus was the child teacher in the temple, Horus was the childteacher in the temple. Jesus had 12 disciples, Horus had 12 followers. Jesus wasthe Morning Star, Horus was the Morning Star. Jesus was the Christ, Horus wasthe Krst. Jesus was tempted on a mountain by Satan, Horus was tempted on amountain by Set. Christianity, founded by the Reptilian-controlled Roman Empire,is a Pagan Sun religion, the worship of which is condemned by Christianity. Itis also an astrology religion, the ‘evil’ of which is condemned by Christianity,not least by the Pope. Pinch me, I’m dreaming. Ouch, no I’m not. The symbolismof Christianity and other religions is like an open book if you know what youare looking for. In St Peter’s Basilica in Rome, they have placed ‘St Peter’sChair’ under a massive depiction of the Sun (Nimrod/Tammuz) and in the centre isthe dove (Semiramis). See Figure 69. The inner elite of the church know what allthis symbolism really means, but the rest are told to believe the fairytale orthey will go to hell. St Peter’s Basilica is built in an east-west direction inaccordance with the movement of the Sun across the Earth. The inside of thegreat Dome of St Peter’s features another sunburst design associated withancient Sun worship (Figure 70). In Babylon, they celebrated the ‘birthday’ ofNimrod in the way we do at Christmas today. The pine tree, or Christmas tree,represented Nimrod and a log – the ‘Yule Log’ – was thrown on the fire tosymbolise his death. On what became our Christmas Day, his rebirth wascelebrated with a tree, decorations and presents. The representation of Nimrodas a pine tree is symbolised in the major courtyard of the ‘Christian’ Vaticanby the biggest sculpture of a pine cone anywhere in the world (Figure 71).Interestingly, the pineal gland, which connects us to our psychic, or ‘sixthsense’, levels of perception, is also shaped like a pine cone. There areEgyptian depictions of Osiris (Nimrod) in the form of a pine cone, and the Greekversion of Nimrod/Tammuz, known as Dionysus, was also depicted carrying the pinecone staff, just like the popes do still to this day. The Vatican seal is thetwo cross keys – ‘St Peter’s Keys to Heaven’ (Figure 72, overleaf) – which areactually the keys to the pagan mysteries said to have been held by the god,Janus (Nimrod), and the goddess, Cybele (Semiramis). The symbol is alsoassociated with another Nimrod in disguise, Mithra, as we’ve seen. The mitreheadgear worn by the Pope and the big-wigs of the Christian Church are thefish-head symbols of Nimrod, who was also known as Dagon, the fish god (Figure73, overleaf). The most important of ‘Christian’ symbols, the cross, is not‘Christian’ either. It was the symbol of Nimrod/Tammuz and was widely usedthroughout the world thousands of years before the mythical ‘birth of Christ’.Worshippers of Nimrod and Semiramis also believed they would be regenerated andpurged of ‘sin’ by being baptised. The ‘Christian’ holy days, festivals andsymbols are the same as those in Babylon because the Church of Rome is simplythe Church of Babylon relocated. Semiramis under her name Ishtar (pronouncedEastar or Ester) gave us ‘Easter’, and the Easter egg comes from the fact thatshe claimed to have come to the Earth from the Moon in an egg. In Rome, the‘mystic egg’ was used to honour the mother goddess and in Europe, China andJapan coloured eggs were part of their sacred festivals. Lent originates fromthe Babylonian period of forty days to commemorate Nimrod/Tammuz, and the Easterham comes from the myth that Tammuz was killed by a wild pig. The Babylonianseven had their version of hot cross buns. The symbol of the Easter bunny is anancient symbol of the Moon goddess Semiramis, the goddess of fertility. Thespring – Easter – was closely associated with worship of the mother goddess andthe reincarnated Nimrod, in the form of Tammuz.Image [../Images/00074.jpg]Figure 69: The Sun symbol of Nimrod/Tammuz/Baal above the Chair of St Peter atthe Vatican. In the middle is the symbol of a dove – the Babylonian symbol forthe goddess, Semiramis Image [../Images/00075.jpg]Figure 70: The sunburst symbolism inside the dome of St Peter’s Basilica Image [../Images/00076.jpg]Figure 71: The biggest pine cone in the world in the major courtyard at theVatican. The pine and pine tree are symbols for Nimrod Image [../Images/00077.jpg]Figure 72: The cross-keys of the Vatican seal are supposed to be ‘St Peter’sKeys to Heaven’, but they said the same about ancient gods like Nimrod undermany different names The main man behind the global emergence of Christianity was Emperor Constantinewho made it the state religion of Rome and oversaw the Council of Nicaea in AD325 that decided what Christians should believe to this day. The doctrine isstill called the ‘Nicene Creed’. Constantine worshipped a deity called SolInvictus – the Unconquered or Invincible Sun – so the ‘new’ Christianity was allvery familiar to him. Constantine converted Rome’s pagan Pantheon (‘Temple toall the gods’) into a Christian church, and changed the names of statues ofgods, demigods and goddesses to those of ‘Christian’ saints. One statue ofJupiter (Nimrod) apparently became ‘St Peter’, and certainly the fast and feastdays of the Babylonian gods became ‘Saints’ Days of ‘Christianity’. Note, by theway, the Sun wheel over the head of old ‘Pete’ in the Vatican statue in Figure74 – this is the real meaning of the halo. It is a symbol of the Sun.Image [../Images/00078.jpg]Figure 73: The fish god, Oannes (Nimrod) as symbolised in Babylon … and thefish-head mitre worn by the Pope and others in the Christian hierarchy. This isno coincidence because the Church of Rome is the Church of Babylon under anothername Different names – same religionBabylon and the Sun god connection are not only confined to the Roman Church andChristianity in general. On the other side of the world in ancient Mesoamerica,the god Quetzalcoatl, the ‘Feathered Serpent’, was said to have been born of avirgin, raised the dead and promised to return. I said that the Jewish Sabbathoriginates from Saturn-day – Nimrod – and in India Saturday is called Shanivarfrom the Vedic god, Shani, who was said to manifest in … the planet Saturn.Semiramis was a version of the Indian deity, Sami-Rama-isi or Semi-Ramas, andKrishna, the virgin-born son of India, was called ‘Christos’, the same as theGreek ‘Christ’, or ‘anointed one’. The soldiers of Alexander the Great calledChristos ‘Krishna’ when they invaded India. Krishna’s father was said to havebeen a carpenter; his birth was marked by a star in the east and attended byangels and shepherds; he was persecuted by a tyrant who ordered the slaughter ofthousands of infants; he worked miracles and wonders, raising the dead andhealing lepers, the deaf and the blind; in some traditions, he died on a tree orwas crucified between two thieves; he was called the ‘Shepherd of God’ andconsidered the ‘Redeemer’, ‘Firstborn’, ‘Sin-Bearer’, ‘Liberator’ and ‘UniversalWord’; he rose from the dead and ascended to heaven ‘in the sight of all men’;he was depicted on a cross with nail-holes in his feet, as well as having aheart emblem on his clothing; he was deemed the ‘Son of God’ and ‘our Lord andSaviour’, who came to Earth to die for human salvation; he was the second personof the Trinity; his disciples purportedly bestowed upon him the title ‘Jezeus,’or ‘Jeseus’, meaning ‘pure essence’; he is to return to judge the dead, ridingon a white horse, to do battle with the ‘Prince of Evil’, who will desolate theEarth. ‘Jesus’ was everywhere long before ‘Jesus’, and Christianity is just oneof the later versions of the religion of Babylon and elsewhere – the Sun andgoddess religion of the Reptilians.Image [../Images/00079.jpg]Figure 74: The statue of ‘St Peter’ in Rome with the Sun wheel halo above hishead They have created many religions to confuse and control the people and they havea clearly identifiable blueprint they work to. The first stage is to create anew religion that can be played off against their other religions to bringconflict and divide and rule. Then, they fracture the original religion intoopposing groups so they fight among themselves, as well as with their rivalreligions. We saw this with the Protestant breakaway from the Church of Romethrough the Martin Luther rebellion in the early 16th century, and theProtestant faith now appears itself in endless, often warring, forms. But, theyare all the religion of Babylon, which is the religion of Sumer and theReptilians. The same process happened with Islam as a new religion emerged inthe seventh century that went to war with Christianity. It, too, broke into itsown warring groups, the Sunnis and the Shiites, who have been slaughtering eachother for centuries. Witness what is happening in Iraq today. The Judaicreligion has also been brought into conflict with both Christianity and Islam,and Judaism has its own factions. Could it really be that the same manipulatingforce has been behind the creation and expansion of all of these ‘different’religions? Oh yes.Christianity is the Mystery religion of Babylon and Nimrod under another name,and the texts on which Judaism is based were put together after the Judean’s70-year captivity after 587 BC in … Babylon. Out of this came the Kabbalah orCabala, which is straight out of the Babylon Mystery tradition, and this waspassed down orally long before it appeared in written form. There is also theBabylonian Talmud, a deeply racist tome, that was also inspired by theBabylonian ‘exile’ and plays a major part in Jewish belief. Judaism is yetanother inner and outer religion, in which the insiders knowingly follow thereligion of Babylon and understand what the symbolism really means, while themasses are told to take it all literally. Look at the symbolism in two famousOld Testament stories. There is the tale of Noah who realised the flood waterswere receding when a dove returned to the ark bearing an olive branch. Semiramiswas symbolised as a dove in Babylon and her name literally means‘branch-bearer’. Another good example is the story of Samson. In the ancientworld they used to symbolise the movement of the Sun, or the Earth in relationto the Sun, as the life of a mythical man. He would be born after the wintersolstice when he – the Sun – was portrayed as a baby. The child would then growup into a strapping, powerful man with long golden hair by the time of thesummer solstice when the Sun is at its strongest in the northern hemisphere. Thelong golden hair represented the power of the Sun’s rays at that time. The storytold how Samson’s hair became shorter and he lost his strength as the yearentered the autumn, or fall. This was represented by the House of Virgo theVirgin … the House of Delilah. There we have the symbolic story of Samson,Samsun, which both Jews and Christians are told to believe really existed.Christianity and the Judaic/cabalistic religions are not different faiths onceyou scrape away the facade. They come from the same source and so does much ofIslam. It, too, includes mythical, symbolic stories from Christianity andJudaism and accepts them to be literally true. It believes in the ‘Christian’Jesus, Mother Mary and the Angel Gabriel, and in the ‘Jewish’ Abraham, Noah andMoses. The Koran says of Islam:> [It is] … The same religion has He established for you as that which He> enjoined on Noah ... and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.> (42:13 AYA). > But say, ‘We [Muslims] believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and> in that which came down to you [Christians and Jews] our Allah and your Allah> is One.’ (29:46 AYA). > For to them [Christians and Jews] was entrusted the protection of Allah’s> Book. (5:47 AYA/44 MP). Image [../Images/00080.jpg]Figure 75: The way the Sun god and Moon goddess were depicted in the land of Ur(Sumer/Babylon) from about 2000 BC … and the international symbol of Islamtoday. Islam is yet another Babylonian religion The Koran considers Jesus, or ‘Isa’ in Arabic, to be one of Islam’s mostsignificant prophets and gives considerable attention to Mother Mary, or‘Maryam’ in Arabic. It agrees that Jesus was born through a virgin birth anddepicts Mary in glowing terms. The 19th chapter of the Koran is even named afterher, one of only eight ‘people’ to enjoy such an honour in the entire book. ButJesus is really the Babylonian Sun god Tammuz/Ninus and Mother Mary is QueenSemiramis, the virgin mother and Moon goddess of Babylon. You can see in Figure75 an ancient depiction of the Sun god, Shamash, and the Moon goddess, Nanna,from the land of Ur (Sumer/Babylon/Iraq) from around 2000 BC. Alongside is theinternational symbol of Islam. Do you think by any chance they could berelated?? Christianity, Judaism and Islam all consider Jerusalem to be a sacredplace and the obsession with this city and Temple Mount, location today ofIslam’s ‘Dome of the Rock’, has led to the terrible events in Jerusalem throughthe centuries. Jewish people are famous for wearing the skullcap as part oftheir religion, but Muslims wear skull caps, too, and so do the Pope and othersin the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Where did the skullcap come from? Thepriesthood of Babylon. The shaving of the head common to so many faiths has thesame familiar origin as Alexander Hislop writes in The Two Babylons:> Over all the world, where the traces of the Chaldean [Sumerian/Babylonian]> system are found, this tonsure or shaving of the head is always found along> with it. The priests of Osiris, the Egyptian Bacchus, were always> distinguished by the shaving of their heads. In Pagan Rome, in India, and even> in China, the distinguishing mark of the Babylonian priesthood was the shaven> head. > Thus Gautama Buddha, who lived at least 540 years before Christ, when setting> up the sect of Buddhism in India which spread to the remotest regions of the> East, first shaved his own head, in obedience, as he pretended, to a Divine> command, and then set to work to get others to imitate his example. One of the> very titles by which he was called was that of the ‘Shaved-head’. ‘The> shaved-head,’ says one of the Purans, ‘that he might perform the orders of> Vishnu, formed a number of disciples, and of shaved-heads like himself’. > The high antiquity of this tonsure may be seen from the enactment in the> Mosaic law against it. The Jewish priests were expressly forbidden to make any> baldness upon their heads (Lev 21:5), which sufficiently shows that, even so> early as the time of Moses, the ‘shaved-head’ had been already introduced. In> the Church of Rome the heads of the ordinary priests are only clipped, the> heads of the monks or regular clergy are shaven, but both alike, at their> consecration, receive the circular tonsure, thereby identifying them, beyond> all possibility of doubt, with Bacchus, ‘the mutilated Prince’. Catholics and Muslims both have their rosary beads and both Jewish and Muslimwomen have laws about men touching them, even in the most innocent way. The term‘Amen’ used by Christianity, Judaism and Islam comes from the Egyptian Sun god,Amon, or Amen Ra. These religions, along with Hinduism and so many more, are allthe same Reptilian religion manipulating people to worship the Reptilian ‘gods’,and what you worship you give your energy to. We are looking at the same originswherever you turn, yet these ‘faiths’ are portrayed and followed by the ignorantas if they are different. Only in outward appearance are they at odds. At theircore, they are the same, and so it is with the religions across the world. Thegod-mother-child religion was a global phenomenon before the Flood and wasretained in its many and various expressions in the fragmented societies thatemerged from the deluge. It has been used in its many forms to divide and rulethe masses, implant a false history and version of life, and suppress thecirculation of the knowledge I detailed in the first two chapters. Thisknowledge was known in the ancient Mystery religions before and after the Floodand was largely passed on through initiates chosen by the Mystery priesthood,but it was still far more widely available among the general population than themanipulators wanted. Their power is in knowing what the people don’t know, likehow we create and influence our reality. They wanted to control the peoples’reality and to do this they had to make them see the world and themselves in theway that suited the Reptilian plan. Essential to that, was taking out ofcirculation as much of the advanced knowledge as possible in relation to who weare and the nature of life. Ironically, but typically, they did this by keepingthe knowledge strictly hidden within the inner core of their churches and secretsocieties while using the literal version of those same religions to demonisethe knowledge where it did circulate among the population.This was the motivation behind the Christian Inquisitions that slaughteredmulti-millions throughout the world in the name of ‘fighting the Devil’ in‘God’s’ holy war against the Heathens. For Heathens read Infidels or Goyim,depending on your mind prison of choice. The Inquisition terrorised Europe with‘witches’ and other carriers of the knowledge tortured and killed in staggeringnumbers as the Christian fantasy was mercilessly imposed on once-Celtic lands.The same happened wherever the Christian crackpots and their manipulatingmasters came ashore. The shamans, seers and knowledge carriers were targeted andkilled by the Roman Church and the Protestant extremists when the British andother European empires emerged. The ancient communities and knowledge of theAmericas, Africa, Asia, and Australia were all but destroyed, and the peoplewere forced, or manipulated, to follow Christianity’s manufactured beliefs.Where Christianity could not go, the Islamic crazies were doing the same in thename of Allah. This story of human ignorance and control is not purely aboutreligion, however. It is a major and highly effective weapon for themanipulators to unleash upon the human mind, but the web of deceit is about morethan that. The secret society network weaves its manipulation into all areas ofhuman life, especially politics, ownership of the means of production,communication and finance, the supply of essentials like food, water and power,and the military.Image [../Images/00081.jpg]Figure 76: The ‘British’ goddess, Britannia, is also another name for QueenSemiramis … Image [../Images/00082.jpg]Figure 77: … and can also be seen at the Vatican in Rome Global BabylonThe Reptilian bloodlines expanded out of Rome with the Roman Empire, andinterbred with the hybrids that had gone thousands of years before within theroyal and ‘elite’ lines of the Phoenicians, Egyptians and Sumerians, as I detailin books like The Biggest Secret, Children of the Matrix and Tales from the TimeLoop. Britain was a target for them and ‘British’ symbols like Britannia, StGeorge, and even ‘Scottish’ bagpipes, originate in the Middle and Near East. The‘British’ goddess, Britannia, is Queen Semiramis (Figures 76 and 77); St Georgeis George of Cappadocia in what is now Turkey; and bagpipes came fromMesopotamia and were carried by the travelling musicians, or troubadours, toRome and on to Britain. The bloodlines that resulted from the breeding between‘good stock’ became the royal and aristocratic families of Europe, and theyremained overtly in power for centuries. One of the bloodline groupings is knownas the ‘Black Nobility’, which came out of Rome and Italy, especially centreslike Venice, and this is featured at some length in The Biggest Secret. When thepeople eventually rebelled against these royal and aristocratic dictatorships,the bloodline families moved into politics and all the other institutions ofpower, to continue and expand their control behind the cloak of ‘elected’parliaments, government administration, banking and commerce. The bloodlines, ineffect, went largely undercover to deceive the people into believing they had afree choice about who would rule them.The global expansion of the European powers, most notably the British Empire,exported the Sumerian/Reptilian bloodline across the world and they ruled ascolonial masters, working in tandem with the Reptilian hybrid religions andsecret societies, like the Freemasons, to mentally and physically control thepeople. When the colonial powers apparently withdrew and gave those lands‘independence’, this was only on the surface. They left behind in thosecountries the bloodlines, and the secret society network that manipulates theminto power, and they have continued to control those former colonies ever since.This covert control is much more effective than an open dictatorship and theyuse terms like ‘democracy’ to hide the real power structure. Overt control, adictatorship you can see, always has a finite life because in the end there willbe a challenge and rebellion against it. The people know they are beingcontrolled and who is doing it. Covert control, which you cannot see, identifyor target, can go on forever until it’s exposed because you don’t rebel againstsomething you don’t know exists. This is the prison without the bars, or barsyou are aware of. People who think they are free will not complain that they’renot. Throughout Africa, Central and South America, Asia, the Far East,Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada, open control from Britainand Europe has been replaced by covert control by bloodline and secret societywith their headquarters overwhelmingly in Europe – especially Rome and London.New Rome in the ‘New World’The takeover of the Americas is a perfect example of the way the game has beenplayed. The Americas were officially discovered by the explorer, ChristopherColumbus, in 1492, but those lands were actually visited many times in thethousands of years before by peoples like the Phoenicians, Norse, Irish, Welsh,Bretons, Basques and Portuguese. The fable that Columbus was looking for Indiaand found the Americas by accident is a ludicrous lie. He was an agent of theReptilian hybrid secret society network and knew the Americas were there. Onlysome twenty years after the first Columbus voyage, Piri Reis, an Ottoman TurkishAdmiral, produced a map of what the land mass of Antarctica looked like threehundred years before that continent was officially discovered. The accuracy ofhis map has been confirmed by modern techniques. He said he drew the map fromearlier ones, the same sources available to Columbus and other Reptilian hybridinsiders. As the Freemasonic historian, Manly P. Hall, has explained, Columbuswas connected to the secret society network in Genoa and northern Italy. He wasalso employed at one time by Rene d’Anjou of the Reptilian hybrid House ofLorraine. Crucial support for Columbus came from two high initiates of thebloodline cabal, Lorenzo de Medici, one of the most powerful Venetian Reptilianhybrid families of the Black Nobility, and the artist, Leonardo da Vinci.Columbus was also supported by King Ferdinand of Spain and his wife, QueenIsabella of Castile, who also instigated the horrific Spanish Inquisition thatbegan in 1478 and was not abolished until 1834.Five years after Columbus landed in the Caribbean, an Italian called John Cabotset sail from Bristol in the west of England to officially discoverNewfoundland, Nova Scotia and North America. The name ‘Bristol’ evolved from‘Barati’, the later ‘Britannia’ (Semiramis), and was once called Caer Brito.Bristol was a centre for the Knights Templar, a major Reptilian hybrid secretsociety, and an area of the city today is still called Temple Meads inrecognition of that. Cabot’s son, Sebastian, who was born in Venice, also sailedto the Hudson Bay in Canada and led an expedition for the Spanish to SouthAmerica. The Cabots said they were looking for Asia! All these expeditions of‘discovery’ were coordinated by the Reptilian hybrid secret society network.John Cabot’s real name was Giovanni Caboto and he was a naturalised Venetian whocame from Genoa – the very city where Columbus operated from at the same timethat Cabot was there. Manly P. Hall, a high degree Freemason himself, said thatboth were connected to the same secret societies and the ‘Wise Men of the East’.He adds in his book, America’s Assignment With Destiny:> The explorers who opened the New World operated from a master plan and were> agents of re-discovery rather than discoverers. Very little is known about the> origin, lives, characters, and policies of these intrepid adventurers.> Although they lived in a century amply provided with historians and> biographers, these saw fit either to remain silent or to invent plausible> accounts without substance. Given what I am revealing, there is no need to speculate over why it was alldone so secretly. Over the next four centuries the Reptilian hybrid elite ofEurope, particularly Britain, but also including the Dutch, French, Belgians,Spanish, Portuguese, Germans and others, plundered the planet, massivelyexpanding the control of the bloodlines. Hernando Cortes, who led the Spanishtakeover of Central America after Columbus, typified their behaviour. The nativepeoples had their own system of measuring time and they had a date on which theyexpected the return of their god, Quetzalcoatl, their version ofNimrod/Tammuz/Jesus. The date of the expected second coming of the white god,Quetzalcoatl, was, in European time, 1519. They believed he would be wearingattire in keeping with his title of the Plumed Serpent. Cortes went ashore inMexico in 1519 wearing plumed feathers, and he even landed close to the spotwhere Quetzalcoatl was expected. He was also carrying a cross, again in keepingwith the Quetzalcoatl legend. Because of this, the Aztec king, Montezuma,believed, like his people, that Cortes was the long awaited return of their god.This allowed Cortes, with only 598 men, to gain control and by the time theyrealised that Cortes was no second coming it was too late. Mass slaughter of thenative peoples followed. One Spanish historian estimated at least 12 millionnatives of South America alone were killed after the Europeans arrived and aneven greater number became slaves. Among the Spanish conquests were the lands ofthe Incas and the Maya, and much of their knowledge was lost, or systematicallydestroyed. The same happened in North America where the Europeans killed untoldnumbers of Native Americans and virtually wiped away that culture. The nativepeoples of Africa, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere suffered a similar fate.Credo Mutwa tells in the video, The Reptilian Agenda, how strange tall beings,known as ‘The Beasts of the Terrible Blanket’, appeared in Africa in the yearsbefore the white Europeans arrived, and these beings carried the same symbolslater used by Christian missionaries, especially the Jesuits.The first permanent English settlement in what became the United States was atJamestown, Virginia, in the early 17th century. Virginia, it is said, was namedafter Elizabeth I, the completely misnamed ‘virgin queen’, but, in truth, it wasinspired by Semiramis, the virgin queen of Babylon. It was the Virginia Company,owned by the British Crown and aristocratic bloodlines, which controlled theAmerican colonies. Freemasons were at the forefront of the change from overt tocovert rule by Britain of the North American continent. This transition is knownby history as the American War of Independence. The Reptilian agenda for Americawas encapsulated in Sir Francis Bacon’s work, The New Atlantis, published in1607, in which an ‘Invisible College’ of elite intellectuals dictated events.Bacon was a high initiate of the secret society cabal in Britain. One of theleading Freemasons of the British colonies in America was Benjamin Franklin, whois still revered as a man who believed in freedom for the people despite owningblack slaves like many other founders of the ‘Land of the Free’. Franklin wasactually a master manipulator, the Henry Kissinger of his day. He officiallybecame a Freemason in February 1731 and was made Provincial Grand Master ofPennsylvania in 1734. In the same year, Franklin printed the first Masonic bookin America and the first recorded American lodge was founded in his province inPhiladelphia. It was from here that the American War of ‘Independence’ wasorchestrated on that side of the Atlantic, but the centre of manipulation wasthe ‘Mother Lodge’ of Freemasonry, founded in London in 1717, and located, as itstill is today, in Great Queen Street – a Babylonian title for Semiramis (Figure78). The Freemasons are Sun god worshippers, although most of them will notrealise that, so confused are they by the true meaning of their rituals.Image [../Images/00083.jpg]Figure 78: The ‘Mother Lodge’ of Freemasonry in Great Queen Street, London. The‘Great Queen’ was a Babylonian name for Queen Semiramis Benjamin Franklin was a member of Freemasonic networks in France, like the NineSisters and the San Juan Lodges, which helped to manipulate the FrenchRevolution in 1789, and he was an initiate of the highly exclusive Royal Lodgeof Commanders of the Temple West of Carcassonne. In Britain, he became a memberof the satanic Hellfire Club with his close friend, the British Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, Sir Francis Dashwood, who was linked to many esoteric groups,including the Druid Universal Bond. Dashwood had a huge cave dug at his WestWycombe estate, north of London, for their satanic rituals and sexual ‘magic’ceremonies. These two Satanists, Franklin and Dashwood, produced a prayer bookwhich became the basis for the Christian Book of Common Prayer, but maybe thisis not so ironic when you know Christianity’s origins. Benjamin Franklin, whowas extremely close to the British Royal Family and aristocracy, is supposed tobe the man who genuinely led a ‘rebellion’ against the same British Crown. Whatnonsense. In truth, he was agent for British Intelligence and the ‘War ofIndependence’ was engineered and purposely lost as part of the transition fromovert to covert control. Official history to this day says that the flash-pointfor the war came when a group of Mohawk Indians boarded a ship called theDartmouth in Boston Harbour and threw its cargo of tea into the water. This wasdubbed the Boston Tea Party. The ‘rebels’ were not Mohawk Indians, but membersof the St Andrew’s Freemason Lodge in Boston dressed up as Indians and led bytheir junior warden, Paul Revere. This event could not have happened withoutsupport from the British-controlled Colonial Militia, who had been detailed toguard the Dartmouth. The captain of one detachment, Edward Proctor, was a memberof … the St Andrew’s Lodge. This lodge was the first in the world to confer anew Freemasonic degree called the Knights Templar Degree. The Grand Master,Joseph Warren, was appointed Grand Master of the whole of North America by theGrand Lodge of Scotland. Other members of the St Andrew’s Lodge included JohnHancock, who would be a leader of the Continental Congress and the first to signthe Declaration of Independence. At least three members of the St Andrew’sLodge, including Paul Revere, were members of the ‘loyal nine’, the inner eliteof an important revolutionary group called the Sons of Liberty. It was thisgroup which organised the Boston Tea Party.Image [../Images/00084.jpg]Figure 79: The rising Sun sign of Nimrod/Tammuz/Horus on the Sun Chair of thefirst US President, George Washington … and the same symbol is located over thefamous front door of 10 Downing Street, home of the British Prime Minister –even down to the rays around the inner circle. The rising Sun symbolises thereturning the Sun god and strongly features at Freemasonic temples Much of this information is documented by the Freemasonic historian, Manly P.Hall, who also points out that of the fifty-six signatories of the AmericanDeclaration of Independence, almost fifty were known Freemasons and only one wasdefinitely known not to be. And get this. All those who signed the declarationwere apparently cousins and from a royal bloodline. On September 3rd 1783, thecolonies were recognised as an independent republic and the first President wasGeorge Washington, a British aristocratic bloodline and high Freemason, who satin a chair with a rising Sun carved into the back – the ancient symbol ofNimrod/Tammuz/Horus. The same Sun symbol can be seen today over the door of 10Downing Street, home to the British Prime Minister and another Reptilian hybridstronghold, and at Freemasonic temples (Figure 79). The rituals and symbolismcarried through the ages by the bloodlines and secret societies can also be seenin the way George Washington was depicted in an official statue. Compare it withthe statute of the ancient Greek god, Zeus, on which it was based, and the imageof Baphomet, the goat-headed satanic ‘god’ (Figure 80, overleaf). Countries mayhave different names, but they are owned by the same force. George Washingtonwas Grand Master of the Freemason Lodge at Alexandria (named after the ‘City ofthe Serpent’s Son’ in Egypt), near Washington DC. When he was inaugurated asPresident on April 30th 1789, the day before the major Brotherhood ritual day,May Ist or May Day, the oath was taken by Robert Livingstone, the Grand Masterof the New York Grand Lodge. The ceremony was an entirely Freemasonic ritualcarried out by Freemasons and the same Freemasonic ‘Bible’ used in theinauguration of George Washington was still being used when Bill Clinton and BoyGeorge Bush became president. Look at the genealogy of American presidents,leading politicians, banking and business tycoons, military leaders, mediaowners, government officials, intelligence agency chiefs, etc., and you willfind they invariably come from the same bloodlines, which can be charted back tothe British and European royal and aristocratic (Reptilian hybrid) families whocame out of the Middle and Near East at the time of Sumer, Babylon and Egypt.Image [../Images/00085.jpg]Figure 80: The statue of George Washington, now at the National Museum ofAmerican History, the statue of Zeus on which the Washington version was based …and the image of Baphomet, the Satanic compilation god Image [../Images/00086.jpg]Figure 81: Capitoline Hill in Rome today – location of the temple to the‘Capitoline [Babylonian] Triad’ and inspiration for the name of the centre ofgovernment in the United States, which is controlled by the same ‘elite’bloodlines that ruled ancient Rome Architectural signaturesThe Freemason founders of the United States built their new capital ‘WashingtonDC’ on land known at the time as ‘New Troy’ and one 400-acre section was evenknown as ‘Rome’ with a stream running through it called the Tiber. Washington isindeed the New Troy or New Rome, just look at the architecture for a start. Itssymbolic centre is Capitol Hill, not Capital Hill, but Capitol. This comes fromCapitoline Hill, the highest of the Seven Hills of Rome (Figure 81). It was herethat a Temple once stood to the ‘Capitoline Triad’, including Jupiter, orNimrod. Capitol comes from the Latin word ‘caput’, which means ‘human skull’. Askull was found on the hill when the foundations of the temple were being dug,it is said, and so came the name ‘Capitoline’ or ‘Human Skull’ Hill, and the usetoday of the word ‘caput’ to mean ‘finished’ or ‘dead’. In the symbolic Gospelstories, the location of the ‘crucifixion’ of Jesus is a place called Golgotha,which means the Place of the Skull. You can see the inspirational and symbolicprogression through the ages as the Reptilian/Illuminati bloodlines haveexpanded their influence and power. There is the ancient Roman Pantheon, theTemple of all the gods, which inspired the dome of St Peter’s and the Vaticanwhen the religion of Babylon and Rome became the religion of Christianity. The‘Protestant’ cathedral of St Paul’s in the heart of the Reptilian hybridfinancial district known as the City of London continued the blueprint, and whenthe bloodlines built Washington DC, their new Rome/new Troy, the architecturalstyle was the same as ever (Figures 82 to 85).Image [../Images/00087.jpg]Figure 82: The Roman Pantheon, the Temple of all the gods, which was‘Christianised’ by Emperor Constantine … Image [../Images/00088.jpg]Figure 83: … the Pantheon inspired the Dome of St Peter’s and the Vatican … Washington is a mass of esoteric and Babylonian/Roman symbolism in its streetplan and architecture, as I will come to later, and it is the same with othermajor cities. The United States capital is in the District of Columbia, the‘District of the Semiramis’ – the ‘dove’ of Babylon. The Roman Reptilian hybridsworshipped Semiramis as Venus Columba, or ‘Venus the Dove’, and Columbe is stillthe word for dove in French. We also have British Columbia in Canada, ColumbiaPictures, Columbia University and Columbia Broadcasting, the US network betterknown as CBS. One of the most horrific events in America in recent times was theshootings at Columbine High School, and when you begin to appreciate theunbelievable obsession these people have with symbolism, down to the finest ofdetail, that location is not a co-incidence. The Statue of ‘Liberty’ is alsoQueen Semiramis. Look at an ancient depiction of Semiramis (note she is holdinga cross) and compare it with the Statue of Liberty holding the lighted torch,the Babylonian symbol for Nimrod (Figures 86, 87 and 88). The statue is alsostanding on an image of the Sun (Figure 89). The Statue of Liberty was given toNew York by French Freemasons in Paris who knew exactly what it really portrayed– and it is anything but liberty. There is another Statue of Liberty, anotherSemiramis, in Paris on an island in the River Seine (Figure 90) and a massiveversion of the Liberty Flame, Nimrod again, on top of the Pont d’Alma Tunnel inParis where Diana, another name for the Moon goddess Semiramis, was assassinatedin 1997 (Figure 91). Pont d’Alma means Bridge or Passage of the Moon Goddess andapparently the Merovingians had their main ritual site where that tunnel istoday. For the detailed background to the symbolism in Washington, Paris, otherIlluminati centres and by the bloodlines in general, see The Biggest Secret andChildren of the Matrix.Image [../Images/00089.jpg]Figure 84: … which inspired St Paul’s Cathedral in the Illuminati stronghold,the City of London … Image [../Images/00090.jpg]Figure 85: … and the same theme can be seen in ‘New Rome’, Washington DC, withits own Capitol Hill Image [../Images/00091.jpg]Figure 86: Queen Semiramis, as depicted on an ancient coin … have you seen hersomewhere before?

There was a global society of great advancement, but therewere factions that wished to control and conquer and it all ended in war and amassive Flood and other cataclysmic events. An inter-dimensional race ofreptilian entities began interbreeding with humans aeons ago and this hascontinued ever since. They created hybrid bloodlines that became the ‘royal’bloodlines around the world and claimed the right to rule through their geneticconnection to the ‘serpent gods’. A major centre for the Reptilian bloodlinesafter the Flood was ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia, ‘The Land Between Two Rivers’,which official history calls ‘the cradle of civilisation’. It was later known asBabylon. The Reptilian hybrid ‘royal’ bloodlines were seeded throughout theplanet, not least in China where the dragon is still the national culturalsymbol, but the bloodlines out of Sumer and the later Babylon, now Iraq, holdthe key to understanding the way events have unfolded to the present day. As theReptilian-possessed hybrids expanded their influence and control to Egypt,Greece, Rome and elsewhere, they created a network of secret societies tomanipulate their people into power and remove those who were getting in the way.The rulers of this network became known as the ‘Illuminati’. They also foundedreligions based on the Sumerian and Babylonian Mysteries. The hierarchical,compartmentalised structure, mirrored in secret societies, ensured that only thechosen few were told the truth behind these religious control systems, while thefollowers were sold a cover story to believe, on pain of death, torture andthreats of eternal Hell. The religions condemned the very esoteric knowledge onwhich they were themselves covertly based, and they have been used throughinquisition and imposition to remove the ancient knowledge from publiccirculation to keep humanity in ignorance of itself and its reality.The plan has always been to centralise power in every area of life, because themore you centralise decision making the fewer people can dictate to the rest.The goal is to have a world government that would dictate to every country; aworld army that would impose the will of the world government; a world centralbank to control global finance; a world currency that would be electronic, notcash; and a microchipped population linked to a global computer. Look around andyou’ll see how close they already are."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 6 ‘The Cruellest Hoax’ > I can hire half of the working class to kill the other half. > Jay Gould, 1886 The major religions are the ancient Sun and mother-goddess religion in differentdisguises, and it is a similar story with the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines. Theymay appear to have different ‘races’, ‘cultures’ or ‘religions’, but they areall blood-brothers and sisters controlled by the same computer program, and workto a common aim while often appearing to be on different ‘sides’.When it comes to the elite families all over the world they are invariablyReptilian hybrids who are manipulating their masses in line with the same agendaand any public divisions between them are either fakery or different factionsfalling out and fighting for supremacy within the overall plan. The Roman Churchwould seem to be at odds with the Judaic religion and the Christians with theJews when, in fact, the elite families behind all of them are the Reptilianhybrid bloodlines of Sumer. The followers on both ‘sides’ are pawns instilledwith a make-believe religion while their leaders answer to the same Reptilian‘gods’. Once people understand that there are no ‘sides’ when it comes toreligion and politics, because the same force is covertly controlling all ofthem, world events can morph into crystal clarity (Figure 92).Image [../Images/00097.jpg]Figure 92: There may appear to be different ‘sides’, but so often they arecontrolled and manipulated by the same force – the Reptilian hybrids and theirother-dimensional masters There is no greater example of this ‘all-sides’ technique than the Rothschilddynasty, one of the major Reptilian bloodlines on the planet. It is not possibleto understand the nature and personnel of the conspiracy without knowing thebackground to the Rothschilds. They are famous for being ‘Jewish’, but they arenot Jewish at all. They are Sumerian with other Reptilian bloodlines added in,too, and their story reveals another route that the bloodline took from Sumer tothe modern world. The Rothschilds were known as ‘Bauer’ until 1760, when thebanker Mayer Amschel Bauer changed the family name to Rothschild. Many ‘Jewish’families changed their name, often to hide their background, and these includethe Rockefellers, formerly Rockenfelder, and the Roosevelts, formerly Rosenfelt.The name Rothschild comes from the German words for red (Rot) and sign (Schild),and refers to the red sign or symbol above the entrance to their house inFrankfurt. The symbol was a hexagram, also known as the Seal of Solomon or Starof David, and would become the symbol on the flag of the Rothschild-createdIsrael (Figure 93). This was not considered to be a Jewish symbol until it wasadopted by the Rothschilds and can be found in many other cultures and settings.It was used by Arab magicians, Druids and Satanists, among other groups andpeoples. One was found on the floor of a 1,200 year old Moslem Mosque where TelAviv is today. The Rothschild ‘sign’ is on the flag of Israel because that istheir fiefdom. It was their creation and they have controlled it from the start.I have seen ‘Israel’ translated as ‘One Who Fights Victoriously With God’ and‘Prevailing Prince with God’, but others suggest it is an amalgamation of Is(the Egyptian/Babylonian virgin mother Isis/Semiramis); Ra (the Egyptian Sun godsymbolised by the snake and sun disc); and El (an ancient name for ‘god’ andequated with the Babylonian water god, ‘Ea’, who was the Sumerian ‘Enki’, thechief Anunnaki scientist in the cross-breeding programme). El was said to havefathered many gods. Most of the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch had namesending in ‘el’, as in Râmêêl, Kôkabîêl, Tâmîêl, Râmîêl, Dânêl, Êzêqêêl, Asâêl,Batârêl, Anânêl, Zaqîêl, Samsâpêêl, Satarêl, Tûrêl, Jômjâêl and Sariêl. TheBible also includes angels called Michael, Uriel, Raphael and Gabriel. TheRothschilds, and the Bauers before them, have long been associated with the‘occult’. This is a word meaning ‘hidden’ and refers to the hidden knowledgethat can be used for good or ill. Some former Satanists have talked of theRothschilds’ involvement in the black arts and I know from the many insiders andvictims I have spoken with that ‘involvement’ in an understatement of cosmicproportions. Satanism is at the heart of everything the leaders of the family doand one of their sources of esoteric influence and ‘magic’ is the Kabbalah, orKabala/Cabala.Image [../Images/00098.jpg]Figure 93: The symbol that inspired the name Rothschild, or ‘Red Shield’ was asix-pointed star that appears on the flag of Rothschild–controlled Israel Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the dynasty founder, made his fortune thanks to hisclose association with German royalty and aristocracy, especially Prince Williamof Hesse-Hanau, who loved to loan money at high interest rates. No wonder he andRothschild got on so well that he would become the prince’s financial agent. TheHesse dynasty made massive amounts of money from loaning troops to fight othercountry’s wars, and for ‘peacekeeping’, as they called it even then. Hessiantroops fought on the English side during the American Revolution. Prince Williamwas famous for producing many dozens of children with a variety of differentwomen, including a mistress who bore him eight offspring. This is another sourceof the Reptilian hybrid bloodline that can come to prominence without obviousconnections to the elite. ‘Activated’ Reptilian hybrids are obsessed with sexand can never get enough of it. The Hesse dynasty connects into the BritishRoyal Family, and appears to have had close ties with a mysterious figure ofmyth and legend called ‘Count Saint Germain’, who has become a hero and focus ofworship for some New Age groups today. He is a central figure in the beliefs ina ‘Great White Brotherhood’ of ‘Ascended Masters’ guiding humanity. This beliefis promoted by the Theosophical Society of Helena Blavatsky, but ‘bollocks’ isthe word that comes to mind. The New Age ‘I Am’ movement is also based on abelief in this guy as a ‘spiritual master’ and he is said to have been highlyinfluential in the development of the Rosicrucian Order. It is claimed that hewas an alchemist (remember the monatomic gold story), but pinning down the truthfrom the false tales is a life’s work. Some say he was a Portuguese Jew, butother researchers have suggested that Germain was really Leopold-George, the sonof Francis II of Transylvania, the land of the Reptilian vampires. Prince Karlof Hesse, Masonic leader of Germany, apparently believed that Germain had beenbrought up in Italy by the Reptilian Medici dynasty. When Germain reappeared towork among the elite families of Europe, Napoleon III had a dossier compiledabout him that was destroyed when the building mysteriously burned down. Germainvisited William and Karl of Hesse in 1774, and he is claimed to have later livedwith them at a time that Mayer Amschel Rothschild was becoming a key part ofHesse operations. Whatever the truth of all this, it is clear that the Hessefamily and the Rothschilds shared a love of the occult as well as money.Rothschild and his five sons established banking houses in Frankfurt, London,Paris, Vienna and Naples. Mayer Amschel selected the wives of his sons for thebusiness connections they would bring to the family, and, as with all theleading Reptilian dynasties, he wanted his offspring to marry cousins whereverpossible to keep the bloodline ‘pure’. He had eighteen grandchildren and sixteenof them married first cousins. You find a similar story with other primeReptilian bloodlines, like those Rothschild associates, the Habsburgs, and‘royal’ families going back to the ancient world. Rothschild’s daughters allmarried bankers – Worms, Sichel and Beyfus – and the family became immenselyrich, and infamous, for funding all sides in wars that they had often covertlycreated. This includes the two world wars of the 20th century. In 1790, MayerAmschel Rothschild encapsulated the family’s manipulation technique when hesaid: ‘Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes thelaws’. The game was, and is, to get companies and governments in enormous debtand then take them over. The Rothschilds seized control of the United Stateseconomy from the start through their aristocratic front man in GeorgeWashington’s first government, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. It wasHamilton who established the country’s first central bank, the Bank of theUnited States, chartered in 1791, and closed in 1811 when Congress refused tosupport it any longer. Another version came and went before, in 1913, theRothschilds used their agents, the Schiff and Warburg families, to create theprivately-owned (Rothschild-controlled) ‘American’ central bank called theFederal Reserve. The Schiff and Rothschild families were as one and shared thesame house in Frankfurt in the days of dynasty founder Mayer Amschel. JacobSchiff ran the Rothschild-controlled banking operation of Kuhn, Loeb & Companyin the United States, while the Warburgs would later become bankers to Hitler.It was the Rothschilds who financed and controlled John D. Rockefeller’sStandard Oil Company, Edward R. Harriman’s railroad empire, Andrew Carnegie’ssteel empire, and bankers and industrialists like J.P Morgan. All wereconsidered to be great ‘American’ entrepreneurs, or mega crooks, depending onyour viewpoint. In truth, they were all answerable to the Rothschilds, and‘American’ elite families, like the Rockefellers and Bushes, still are. TheRothschilds funded the Russian Revolution in 1917 through people like JacobSchiff at Kuhn, Loeb and Company, and the Harriman operation. The Illuminatiagent, Averill Harriman, was a director of a company called the Guaranty Trustwhen it was financing Lenin and Trotsky to trigger the revolution, and this waslater used to bring about the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the ‘West’.The fear the Cold War created about a possible nuclear holocaust was increasedenormously by seeing the consequences of the two atomic bombs dropped on Japanin 1945 on the order of President Harry S. Truman, the high Freemason andRockefeller cousin. Even though he was American President, Truman said in 1950that ‘the greatest honour that has come to me, and that can ever come to me inmy life, is to be Grand Master of Masons in Missouri’. It is the same with allthese people – the secret society comes first. Japan surrendered after theatomic bombs on the same terms it had agreed before they were dropped. Hiroshimaand Nagasaki were destroyed for reasons of manipulation, not necessity, toplunge the world into fear of a nuclear holocaust with all the manipulationopportunities that would bring. See And The Truth Shall Set You Free for adetailed history of the Rothschilds and their catalogue of grotesquemanipulation that led to wars, the deaths of hundreds of millions,centralisation of global power and the installation of tyrants and dictators todo their bidding – including Hitler.Today, the Rothschilds officially have offices in some forty countries and theyhave been involved in the privatisation policies (selling off the peoples’assets to private interests, often controlled by themselves) in more than thirtycountries. Since the early years of the 20th century, however, when theinfluence of the Rothschilds on world affairs was obvious, they have workedsuccessfully to hide the extent of their holdings and control by using frontcompanies and directors. The current head of the dynasty is Jacob Rothschild,4th Baron Rothschild, the son of Lord Victor Rothschild, ace manipulator ofBritish intelligence during and after the Second World War (see And The TruthShall Set You Free). Jacob married Mary Serena Dunn of the St Clair/Sinclairbloodline of Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland. The chapel was made famous by the book,The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, and even more so by The Da Vinci Code. TheReptilian hybrid St Clair family of France were behind the creation of theKnights Templar secret society and became known as Sinclair when they relocatedto Scotland. The mother of Jacob Rothschild’s wife was Lady Mary Sybil St.Clair-Erskine, the daughter of James Francis Harry St. Clair-Erskine, 5th Earlof Rosslyn. Jacob Rothschild has close connections with Henry Kissinger andmedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch, a friend since the 1960s. He is chairman of theRothschild foundation, Yad Hanadiv, which financed the building of the Israeliparliament, the Knesset, and the Israel Supreme Court. Masonic/Babyloniansymbolism abounds in the building, as you would expect, and there’s a pyramidand all-seeing eye, the Reptilian hybrid symbol you can find on the dollar Bill.Other prominent Rothschilds include Sir Evelyn de Rothschild in England and,until his death in 2007, the French banker, Baron Guy de Rothschild. But, hell,there’s so many of them.Zionism (Rothschild-ism): the fake ‘history’The movement created by the Rothschilds to lay false claim to the land we callIsrael or Palestine is known as Zionism. This term is often used as a synonymfor Jewish people when it is actually a political movement devised, funded andpromoted through the House of Rothschild and opposed by many Jews. The mostvisible Zionist front in the United States today are the so-called‘Neoconservatives’ or ‘Neocons’, who were behind 9/11 and the invasions ofAfghanistan and Iraq. Zionists claim quite simply that the Old Testament saysthat ‘God’ made the Jews his ‘Chosen People’ and gave them the ‘Promised Land’of Israel. Therefore, it belongs to them, no debate necessary. As Golda Meir,the former Israeli Prime Minister, said in the French newspaper, Le Monde, in1971: ‘This country exists as the fulfilment of a promise made by God Himself.It would be ridiculous to ask it to account for its legitimacy’. The invasionand subversion of an entire Arab nation in Palestine has been based on texts inthe Bible written by who knows who, who knows when, thousands of years ago afterthe Jewish captivity in Babylon. It gets even more bizarre when you realise thatthe overwhelming majority of Jewish people have no historical or geneticconnection to Israel, and the claim that there is such a connection is agigantic hoax on both Jewish people and the wider world. The whole thing wasorchestrated by the Rothschild dynasty to advance the goals of the Reptilians.Brave Jewish writers like Arthur Koestler have confirmed from their researchthat Jewish people have no historical claim to the land of Israel. They are notthe biblical Hebrews and they are certainly not ‘Semites’. They don’t originatefrom biblical Israel, but from a Sumerian people who became known as the‘Khazars’ in what became southern Russia and the Caucasus Mountains. Today,their lands are largely occupied by Georgia. This is why the so-called ‘Jewishnose’ is not a genetic trait of Israel, but the Caucasus. Alfred M. Lilienthal,a Jewish former American State Department official, called these facts ‘Israel’sAchilles heel’, because it destroys Zionist claims to the land of the biblicalHebrews. Historians believe the Khazars to be descendants of the Turkic tribe,known as the Huns or Hun, that invaded and savaged Europe from Asia around AD450. The Huns’ territories stretched at one time from central Asia to centralEurope, from Siberia and China to North India. They were a grouping of tribesand bloodlines from the interbreeding with many peoples, including the Chineseand Sumerians. The Huns are best remembered for their leader, Attila the Hun,who seized power by killing his brother, Buda, after whom the Hungarian city ofBudapest was named. Like the Huns, the Khazars spoke a Turkic language and arebelieved to be the same people. The Khazars controlled a large and powerful‘Pagan’ empire across most of Russia, to the Ural Mountains in the East and theCaucasus Mountains in the south. They made their living as traders and‘middlemen’, levying taxes on the goods carried on the trade routes throughtheir lands. Their influence in Eastern Europe extended well into the countrieswe now know as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria(Figure 94). The Khazars were phallic worshippers and engaged in human sacrificerituals.In about AD 740, the King of Khazaria, King Bulan, adopted the religion ofJudaism and the whole nation did the same. Legend says that King Bulan was toldto do this in dreams or visions, but it was clearly a political move to avoidbeing absorbed by the Christian or Islamic world on either side. What iscertain, is that the Khazars, the ancestors of at least 90 per cent of thosecalling themselves ‘Jewish’ today, had no connection with the land calledIsrael. Their home was not the Dead Sea, but the Caspian Sea, which became knownas the ‘Khazar Sea’. This is the area targeted by the Reptilian hybrids todayfor its immense oil and gas reserves. Arthur Koestler writes that ‘a warriornation of Turkish Jews must have seemed to the rabbis as strange as acircumcised unicorn’. An Arab Chronicler, Ibn-Said al-Maghribi, wrote:> As to the Khazars, they are to the north of the inhabited Earth towards the> 7th clime, having over their heads the constellation of the Plough. Their land> is cold and wet. Accordingly their complexions are white, their eyes blue,> their hair flowing and predominantly reddish, their bodies large and their> natures cold. Their general aspect is wild. Certainly, the Caucasus region is so associated with the white race that inNorth America white people are still referred to as ‘Caucasian’. The Khazarsfought, made alliances and interbred with peoples like the Viking Rus (whobecame the Russians) and the Magyars with whom they had extremely closerelations. The Khazars converted to Judaism (another religion of Babylon) inaround AD 740, and they are the ancestors to Reptilian hybrid manipulators likethe Rothschilds, Henry Kissinger, many of the ‘Neocons’ behind the Bushadministration in the United States, and those who have controlled Israel sinceit was formed in 1948. Khazars were instrumental in the creation of the Magyarhomeland of Hungary. Names like the Russian Cossack and the Hungarian Hussarcame from ‘Khazar’, as did the German for heretic, Ketzer. The Khazars also hadclose links with the Byzantine Empire, which was part of the Roman Empirecentred on Constantinople, and there was interbreeding between them. I’m surethe Rothschilds have Roman Empire ‘royal’ blood connections. A Khazar princessmarried Byzantine Emperor Constantine V, and their son became Emperor Leo IV,known as Leo the Khazar, who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 775 to 800. Thedeposed emperor, Justinian II, fled to Khazaria in 705, where the king (the‘Khagan’ or ‘Kagan’) gave him shelter and allowed him to marry his sister. Shetook the name Theodora and became empress when Justinian was restored to theByzantine throne. ‘Kagan’, of course, is a common ‘Jewish’ name today. Accordingto ‘Holy Grail’ author, Sir Laurence Gardner, the archives of the Royal Court ofthe Dragon reveal that the origin of ‘kingship’ is ‘kinship’ or ‘bloodrelative’. Gardner contends that this came from ‘Kainship’ after ‘the first Kingof the “Messianic Dragon succession”, the biblical Cain (Kain), head of theSumerian House of Kish’. The term ‘Kagan’ may have developed from this originand certainly the stories of ‘Jewish’ history are really the history of Sumer,Mu and Atlantis.Image [../Images/00099.jpg]Figure 94: The Khazar Empire. It was here that the vast majority of today’s‘Jewish’ people originated after a mass conversion to Judaism in the eighthcentury. Those who control Israel are not the Biblical ‘Jews’, as they claim.They are the bloodlines of the Khazars and Sumerians Sumerian ‘Jews’The Khazars and their close associates and subordinates, the Magyars, wererelated to the Sumerians. It was believed that the Magyars were a nomadic peoplefrom the north with a language of Finnish-Ugrian origin, but Dr Sandor Nagywrites in The Forgotten Cradle of the Hungarian Culture, that the people wholater became known as Magyars were Sumerians from the ‘Fertile Crescent’ thatbecame the less-than-fertile, Iraq. Dr Nagy uses extensive examples to confirmthe linguistic similarities between the Sumerian, Old Magyar and current Magyarlanguage. He also refers to several works written during the first millennium,including the Arpad Codices and the De Administrando Imperio, and completedfifty years of his own research. He says that while there are only 200 Magyarwords related to the Finno-Ugric language, there are over 2000 related to theSumerian. It was the same story with British, French and German archaeologistsand linguists, who concluded that the language of ancient Sumerian inscriptionswas not Indo-European nor Semitic, but a language which demonstrated significantsimilarities with the group of languages known at the time as the Turanianethnolinguistic group. These included Hungarian, Turkic, Mongolian and Finnic(later referred to as the Ural-Altaic group). Research has indicated that theSumerian-Hungarian languages have over a thousand common word roots and a verysimilar grammatical structure. Kálmán Gosztony, professor of Sumerian philologyat the Sorbonne in Paris, demonstrated in Sumerian Etymological Dictionary andComparative Grammar that the structure of the Hungarian language is the closestto that of the Sumerian. Of the fifty-three characteristics of Sumerian grammar,fifty-one matched in the Hungarian, compared with twenty-nine in the Turkiclanguages, twenty-four in the Caucasian, twenty-one in the Uralic languages,five in the Semitic languages and four in the Indo-European. The linguisticsimilarities between Sumerian, Hungarian and other languages are confirmed bythe archaeological and anthropological evidence. So let’s get this clear. Whatwe call ‘Jewish’ people originally came out of Sumer, and the Sumerians were notSemitic, which refers to people of a particular language group (Figure 95).Therefore, to refer to ‘anti-Semitism’, with regard to Jewish people, isthoroughly inaccurate and their hierarchy, like the Rothschilds, know this.Dr Sandor Nagy says there were two separate migrations of the Sumerian peopleout of Mesopotamia. One was through Turkey to the Carpathian Basin and the otherwent east, and then north, across the Caucasus Mountains into the area betweenthe Caspian and Black Seas. This was the land occupied by the Khazar Empire tosuch an extent that the Caspian became known as the Khazar Sea. The Khazars weredescended from the Huns and the Huns are said to be descended, like the Magyars,from the Sumerians. An ancient traditional pre-Christian account of Hungarianorigins says they are the descendants of the Babylonian Nimrod. The legendclaims that Nimrod had two sons, Magor and Hunor. It is said that Magor was theancestor of the Magyars and Hunor was the ancestor of the Huns, so providing thecommon origin of the Magyars and the Huns (Khazars). Ancient Byzantine sourcessay the Magyars were also called the Sabirs and originated from Mesopotamia, theland of Sumer. Numerous other ancient and medieval sources refer to theScythians, Huns (Khazars), Avars and Magyars as the same peoples, even thoughthe Hungarian authorities appear desperate to deny this. In other books, I havehighlighted the movement of the former Sumerians through the Caucasus Mountainsunder different names, like the Scythians, one of the names by which theFranks/Merovingians were known as they made their journey through the Caucasus.Now, we have further confirmation of the importance of the Caucasus region wheresome highly significant interbreeding occurred between bloodlines from Sumer andthose from the Far East and China. This Caucasian–Chinese–Turkish combinationproduced very important ‘royal’ bloodlines from the Reptilian point of view. Awriter on a Jewish website, using the name Im nin’alu, says:> The Huns’ origin is directly connected with two well-known peoples of the> ancient Middle East: the Sumerians and the Scythians, namely, in the kingdom> founded by Nimrod. Even though they belong to the Japhetic stock and their> most creditable ancestor is Magog, the Sumerian heritage has been kept by them> more than by any other people, which implies that they are in fact the result> of a mixed background. > According to their own legendary accounts (legends that are anyway founded on> true facts), it is very feasible that … they kept close ties with Sumerians> even for a long time after the Sumerians disappeared from Mesopotamia as a> national entity. Their particular link with ancient Sumerians was found> through the comparison of modern Hungarian (Magyar) and other related> languages with documents of the ancient Middle East that revealed a possible> common origin. > The ancient Sumerians, that in the dawn of history settled in Southern> Mesopotamia, in the land commonly known as Shin’ar or Chaldea, arrived there> from the north, precisely from the Ararat region [now Turkey], that they> called ‘Subar-Ki’ or ‘Subar-Tu’. This area was also named after one of the> peoples that inhabited there, the Hurri, whose language was agglutinative like> Sumerian and had many words in common, even being a totally different tongue.> Modern Hungarian shares many terms with both Sumerian and Hurrian, as well as> with Elamite. Image [../Images/00100.jpg]Figure 95: These are some of the countries of the language group known as‘Semites’. The former Khazars and Sumerians that became the basis of today’s‘Jewish’ people were not Semitic and so the term ‘anti- Semitic’ does not apply You might recall from earlier that Sumer was known in southern Africa as‘Sumaru’. The Ararat region is also the biblical location for where ‘Noah’s ark’came to rest after the Flood. It was located, like the Khazars, near the Blackand Caspian seas.The real exodusThe Khazar Empire, the first feudal state in Eastern Europe, broke up in aseries of wars and invasions culminating in the arrival of the Mongol ‘GoldenHorde’, best remembered for their inspiration, Genghis Khan. Over the centuriesof waning power and influence, the Khazar peoples began to emigrate in manydirections. S.W. Baron said of Khazaria in A Social and Religious History of theJews:> Its population was largely absorbed by the Golden Horde which had established> the centre of its empire in Khazar territory. But before and after the Mongol> upheaval the Khazars sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands,> helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centres of Eastern Europe. Khazars took their Judaic and Talmudic (Babylonian/Sumerian) faith and settledin East European and Alpine lands, especially Poland–Lithuania. There are manyancient place names in Poland and the Ukraine inspired by the name ‘Khazar’ or‘Zhid’, a term meaning Jew. These include Kozarzewek, Kozara, Kozarzow andZydowo. As the Khazar Empire collapsed in the period after 960, a number ofSlavonic tribes, led by the Polans, formed an alliance that became the statecalled Poland. ‘Jews’ (Khazars) played an important role in the Polish legendsabout the formation of the country. One says that a ‘Jew’ called AbrahamProkownik was elected by the tribes to rule them. Certainly Khazar ‘Jews’ becameprominent in many countries of Eastern Europe. Jewish writer Arthur Koestlerwrites in The Thirteenth Tribe:> Both the Hungarian and Polish sources refer to Jews employed as mintmasters,> administrators of the royal revenue, controllers of the salt monopoly,> tax-collectors and ‘money-lenders’ – i.e., bankers. This parallel suggests a> common origin of those two immigrant communities; and, as we can trace the> origins of the bulk of Hungarian Jewry to the Magyar-Khazar nexus, the> conclusion seems self-evident. Koestler points out that the traditional garb of Polish Jewry is of unmistakablyEastern origin – ‘The skull-cap (yarmulka) is worn to this day by orthodox Jewsand by the Uzbeks and other Turkish people in the Soviet Union’ (and by Muslimsand the Roman Catholic hierarchy, because the skull cap comes from Babylon). Inthis period, the people formerly known for centuries as the Khazars became knownas ‘Jews’ and their true origin was lost, but not to their elite families whosold a false history to the Jewish masses and the rest of the world. This wasthe belief that they were the biblical Jews and the fallacy continues to thisday with devastating consequences for peace in the Middle East. The Khazar‘Jews’ were confined to ghettos as a result of papal dictat in the mid-16thcentury, and this, together with the 17th-century Cossack massacres in theUkraine, led to another mass exodus into Hungary, Bohemia, Rumania and Germany.There were hardly any Jews in Germany until this time. ‘Thus the great trek tothe West was resumed’, says Koestler. ‘It was to continue through nearly threecenturies until the Second World War and became the principle source of theexisting Jewish communities in Europe, the United States and Israel.’ Koestler,who was himself born in Budapest, says of ‘Jews’ and the Khazar revelation:> … [It] would mean that their ancestors came not from the Jordan, but from the> Volga, not from Canaan but from the Caucasus, once believed to be the cradle> of the Aryan race; and that genetically they are more closely connected to the> Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.> Should this turn out to be the case, then the term ‘anti-Semitism’ would be> void of meaning, based on a misapprehension shared by both the killers and> their victims. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it slowly emerges from the> past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax which history has ever> perpetrated. Benjamin H. Freedman was a one-time Jewish businessman in New York and along-time ‘insider’ before speaking out vociferously against Zionism after WorldWar Two. He was personally acquainted with leading American political figureslike Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy, John F. Kennedy andBernard Baruch. Freedman went much further in his assessment of the Khazarrevelation:> What are the facts about the Jews? (I call them Jews to you, because they are> known as Jews. I don’t call them Jews myself. I refer to them as so-called> Jews, because I know what they are) … There wasn’t one of them [the Khazars]> who had an ancestor who ever put a toe in the Holy Land. Not only in Old> Testament history, but back to the beginning of time. Not one of them! And yet> they come to the Christians and ask us to support their armed insurrections in> Palestine by saying, ‘You want to help repatriate God’s Chosen People to their> Promised Land, their ancestral home, don’t you? It’s your Christian duty. We> gave you one of our boys as your Lord and Saviour … It is as ridiculous to> call them ‘people of the Holy Land’, as it would be to call the 54 million> Chinese Moslems ‘Arabs’ … Stewart Swerdlow, who is himself Jewish, comes from a completely differentresearch background to Freedman and Koestler. He gleaned much of his knowledgeby being on the inside of the government-military mind control programme atMontauk on New York’s Long Island. This is what he says in Blue Blood, TrueBlood:> … [the Sum-Aryans] mostly established themselves in the Caucasus Mountains and> [later] became the Khazars. From here, they spread west towards Europe,> seeding the national identities for the Vikings, the Franks, the Teutonic> [German] peoples and the Russians. Keep in mind that when Atlantis sank, some> of those refugees went to Western Europe and developed into the Celts. Some> went to Greece and others to the Italian Peninsula. These peoples were here> before the hybrids moved in … These Blueblood leaders also infiltrated the> Middle Eastern peoples, such as the biblical Canaanites, Malachites and> Kittites. > Babylon was the civilization that Sumer developed into as it expanded into> Central Asia to become the Khazars. In fact, many of the Blueblood> organisations that developed through the millennia called themselves Babylon> Brotherhoods. [They] later combined with the secret Atlantean-Egyptian schools> in Europe to become the Freemasons. Some of these immigrants went by the name> of Bauer, now known as the Rothschilds. The family quickly took control of the> financial and trade foundations of Europe. This makes sense of why Phillip Eugene de Rothschild said that the importance ofCharlemagne was that he embodied the mixture of the ‘royal’ bloodlines of ‘KingDavid’ (Sum-Aryan/Reptilian) and Alexander the Great (Sum-Aryan/Reptilian).Together they produced a combination which, to them, was a perfect genetic mix,or computer program. Stewart Swerdlow also says that the Reptilians developedhybrid bloodlines with a race now known as ‘the Greys’ from Rigel in the Orionsystem, and these became the royal bloodlines of China and Japan. This isanother reason why the Caucasus and Eastern Europe are so significant. It wasinto this region that the ‘Golden Horde’, and others, came from the Far East tointerbreed with Sumerian Reptilian ‘royal’ bloodlines to create a very importantgenetic combination from the Reptilian perspective.The former Khazar people are known today as the Ashkenazi Jews (pluralAshkenazim) and some writers estimate that perhaps 90 to 95 per cent of thosecalling themselves ‘Jewish’ worldwide are Ashkenazi, or former Khazars. Othersare known as Sephardic Jews and they do have an historical connection to theMiddle East, although, even then, the idea of a ‘chosen race’ going back tobiblical Israel still doesn’t stand up. The Ashkenazim (‘Khazars’) hold thereins of power in Israel and have done so since the country was created in 1948.Every Israeli prime minister has been an Ashkenazi Khazar. The name ‘Ashkenazi’is said by some to originate from Ashkenaz, the Hebrew word for Germany, but theBible refers to the Ashkenaz as a people living in the region of Mount Ararat(now Turkey) and Armenia – ‘Noah’s Ark’ country. That would certainly fit thebasic location of the Khazars. There is also a biblical reference to Ashkenaz,brother of Togarma and nephew of Magog. Joseph, the Khazar king in the secondhalf of the 10th century, wrote in correspondence that they were ancestors ofTogarma, who, he said, had ten sons that seeded all the Turkish tribes,including the Huns, Khazars and Bulgars. In the centuries after the demise ofKhazaria, the Ashkenazi did not speak the Semitic language of Hebrew, which isno surprise at all because they were not Hebrews. They developed their owntongue called Yiddish. This began as a Germanic language from south easterndialects of Middle High German and expanded into central and eastern Europe,starting in the 12th century. Later, it evolved to include elements of Hebrew,Aramaic, Slavic languages and other influences. Once again, Yiddish, thelanguage of the Ashkenazi, did not come from Israel, but from Germany andEastern Europe. The multiple linguistic influences in their language were alsomirrored in the genes of the former Khazars. By this time, they had interbredwith so many other races that they were a genetic cocktail which includedSumerian, Turkish, Far Eastern and northern and western European. However, their‘royal’ bloodlines, like the Rothschilds, then the Bauers, remained ‘pure’through interbreeding, and are a race apart from the rest of their fellow ‘Jews’– just like the Reptilian hybrids in other nations and races. I am not sayingfor a second that there is a ‘Jewish’ plot to control the world. I am sayingthat their leading families, who could not care less about Jewish people ingeneral, are serious players in the Reptilian bloodlines that have infiltratedall peoples and nations with the aim of manipulating themselves into power.The Creation of IsraelThe ‘Jewish homeland’ in the former Palestine was, from the start, a Rothschildfiefdom engineered through the global secret society network controlled byinterbreeding families and known as the Illuminati. In 2006, during theIsrael-Lebanon war, the Israeli writer, Barry Chamish, told of a meeting he hadwith Evelyn Rothschild’s grandson who abandoned the family to be a Mormon.Actually, I say ‘abandoned’, but the Mormon Church and the Watchtower Society(Jehovah’s Witnesses) were funded into existence by the Rothschilds. Theirfounders, like the Mormons, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and the WatchtowerSociety’s Charles Taze Russell, were Merovingian bloodline. At the highestlevels these religions are, as you would expect, Reptilian–satanic operations,as I detail in books like The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix. Anyway,Barry Chamish said he learned from this Rothschild grandson that just sevenfamilies were enjoying the ‘fruits of the war’ in the Lebanon at the time. Thegrandson said of the Rothschilds: ‘They created Israel as their personal toy. Itmakes them richer and gives them more control. It’s not going to be destroyed’.The Rothschilds funded the early European settlers in Israel, manipulated eventsin Germany that led to the horrific treatment of Jewish people, and others, andthen used that as the excuse to reach their long-term goal – aRothschild-Reptilian stronghold in Palestine with the Jewish population treatedlike fodder to be used and abused as necessary. They called their plan‘Zionism’, and the planning and manipulation began in the 19th and early 20thcenturies through the Rothschilds and their gofers such as Chaim Weizmann. TheBritish Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, Viscount Palmerston, was a closeRothschild family associate and patriarch of European Freemasonry. He mixed withall the major Illuminati names of his era, and waged the Opium Wars againstChina on their behalf. As early as 1840, Palmerston wrote:> There exists at the present time among the Jews dispersed over Europe a strong> notion that the time is approaching when their nation is to return to> Palestine. It would be of manifest importance to the Sultan to encourage the> Jews to return and settle in Palestine because the wealth that they would> bring with them would increase the resources of the Sultan’s dominions, and> the Jewish people, if returning under the sanction and protection at the> invitation of the Sultan, would be a check upon any future evil designs of> Egypt or its neighbours. I wish to instruct your Excellency strongly to> recommend to the Turkish government to hold out every just encouragement to> the Jews of Europe to return to Palestine. All bullshit. Palmerston was pushing the secret agenda and he knew it. TheRothschild/Illuminati manipulated the First World War (see And The Truth ShallSet You Free) and this led to the ‘Balfour Declaration’ in 1917 when the BritishForeign Secretary, Lord Balfour, declared his government’s support for a Jewishhomeland in Israel. This announcement was connected to a deal to bring theUnited States into the war, a plan arranged through President Woodrow Wilson’sclosest ‘advisors’, Edward Mandel House and Bernard Baruch – both Rothschildagents in America. The ‘Balfour Declaration’ sounds like some kind of publicannouncement, but it was a letter from Balfour to Lionel Walter Rothschild, 2ndBaron Rothschild, and almost certainly written by Rothschild banker, AlfredMilner. It said:> His Majesty’s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a> national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to> facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that> nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of> existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political> status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. In the latter years of the 19th century, an elite and Rothschild-funded secretsociety was formed in Britain called the Round Table. It was headed by theReptilian hybrid, Cecil Rhodes, who led the conquest of southern Africa for theIlluminati-controlled ‘British’ Empire. He had Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe andZambia, named after him. When he died in 1902, Rhodes was replaced as head ofthe Round Table by Rothschild front man, Alfred Milner, and among the Table’sinner circle was … Lord Balfour. So, the ‘Balfour Declaration’ was a letter,probably written by the head of the Round Table, and officially sent by agovernment minister and elite member of the Round Table to Lord Lionel WalterRothschild, the 2nd Baron Rothschild, who was funding the Round Table. TheDeclaration promised Palestine to both the Jews and Arabs at this time, becausethey wanted to keep the Arabs on their side for a while. They needed them torevolt against the Turks as part of their First World War strategy and theBritish government would use the man known as ‘Lawrence of Arabia’ to lead thiscampaign. Like the government, Lawrence knew it was all a lie and that thepeople of Palestine were being set up. The Balfour Declaration said that‘nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of theexisting non-Jewish communities in Palestine’. But, the Rothschild sidekick,Chaim Weizmann, would say: ‘With regard to the Arab question – the British toldus that there are several hundred thousand Negroes there, but this is a matterof no consequence’. Nor have they been ever since.Enter the NazisAfter Europe had been devastated by the Rothschild-Illuminati First World War,there came the Versailles ‘Peace’ Conference, near Paris, in 1919. Here, thereparations were imposed on the post-war German government, the Weimar Republic,that were so crippling and unsustainable that they prepared the ground – onpurpose – for Hitler and the Nazis to come to power on a platform of restoringGerman pride and the nation’s economy. Every major government ‘advisor’ atVersailles, from Britain, France and the United States, was either a Rothschildbloodline or controlled by them. As I show in And The Truth Shall Set You Free,the American President Woodrow Wilson was ‘advised’ by Colonel House and BernardBaruch, both Rothschild clones and leaders of the Round Table in the UnitedStates; British Prime Minister Lloyd George was ‘advised’ by Alfred Milner, aRothschild employee and Round Table leader, and Sir Phillip Sassoon, a directdescendant of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the dynasty; Frenchleader, Georges Clemenceau, was ‘advised’ by his Minister for the Interior,Georges Mandel, whose real name was Jeroboam Rothschild. Surprise, surprise, theVersailles ‘Peace’ Conference also gave its official support for a Jewishhomeland in Palestine. The Rothschilds and their associates wrote the Treaty ofVersailles that awarded the Rothschilds the German-owned railway rights inPalestine. The Rothschilds had also loaned nearly £100 million to the Turkishgovernment, and when it collapsed after losing the Arab revolt led by Lawrenceof Arabia, the Rothschilds claimed rights to Palestine in compensation for thedebt. They were now perfectly placed for the final push to create the newIs-Ra-El. The Hitler regime was funded by Reptilian hybrid Rothschild agents inthe United States, including the Rockefellers, Harrimans and Prescott Bush,grandfather of the idiot president. This allowed the German war machine toemerge in just a few years from the ashes of fantastic economic collapse. Thesecret societies directly behind the Nazis, like the Thule and Vril Societies,interconnected with the secret societies of the Roman (Babylonian) Church and soemployed all the ancient Reptilian symbols (Figure 96). This network broughtHitler to power and what followed were the Second World War, the concentrationcamps, and the Illuminati–Rothschild use of these horrors to secure theirlong-held goal: a foothold in the Middle East to advance their plans far intothe future.Image [../Images/00101.jpg]Figure 96: The Nazis were the creation of the Reptilian hybrids and so they usedall the same symbols. Here we see the Maltese Cross of the Illuminati Knights ofMalta, the skull and crossbones, and the eagle, which represents the phoenix,the ancient ‘sun-bird’ In And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret, I have detailed theIlluminati connection to the Nazi concentration camps, and the Zionist,Rothschild, Bush family and House of Windsor links to the Third Reich. TheBiggest Secret also looks at the evidence that Hitler was a Rothschildbloodline. He was certainly a skilled occultist, although far from the mostadvanced among the occult-dominated Nazi regime. The writer and researcher, AlanBullock, said that Hitler’s power to bewitch an audience has been likened to theoccult art of the African medicine man, or the Asiatic shaman. Others havecompared it to the psychic-sensitivity of a medium and the magnetism of ahypnotist. Hermann Rauschning, an aide to Hitler, said in his book, HitlerSpeaks:> One cannot help thinking of him as a medium. For most of the time, mediums are> ordinary, insignificant people. Suddenly, they are endowed with what seems to> be supernatural powers, which set them apart from the rest of humanity. The> medium is possessed. Once the crisis is passed, they fall back into> mediocrity. It was in this way, beyond any doubt, that Hitler was possessed by> forces outside of himself – almost demoniacal forces of which the individual> man, Hitler, was only the temporary vehicle. The mixture of the banal and the> supernatural created that insupportable duality of which one was conscious in> his presence … it was like looking at a bizarre face whose expression seemed> to reflect an unbalanced state of mind coupled with a disquieting impression> of hidden powers. Hitler was another possessed vehicle for the other-dimensional Reptilians andappeared to live in perpetual fear of the ‘supermen’. Hermann Rauschning toldhow Hitler suffered from terrible nightmares and he would wake in terror,screaming about entities that were invisible to all but himself. Hitler oncesaid to his aide:> What will the social order of the future be like? Comrade I will tell you.> There will be a class of overlords, after them the rank and file of the party> members in hierarchical order, and then the great mass of anonymous followers,> servants and workers in perpetuity, and beneath them again all the conquered> foreign races, the modern slaves. And over and above all these, will reign a> new and exalted nobility of whom I cannot speak … but of all these plans the> militant members will know nothing. The new man is living amongst us now! He> is here. Isn’t that enough for you? I will tell you a secret. I have seen the> new man. He is intrepid and cruel. I was afraid of him. This is the society planned by the Reptilians and their hybrid ‘master race’,and we are seeing it unfold by the day. Hitler’s behaviour was extremelyindicative of demonic possession, including his strange epileptic-like fits.Many people close to Hitler said that he woke up in the night screaming andhaving convulsions. He would call for help and appeared to be half paralysed. Hewould gasp to the point of suffocation and, often when fully conscious, he wouldpoint to apparently empty space and scream: ‘He is here. There! In the corner’.Hitler was also obsessed with the Reptilian bloodline hero, Charlemagne, andspent a lot of time, as did other top Nazis, at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, wherelegends say that the spirit of Charlemagne resides in the Obersalzberg Mountainwaiting for the time to return and restore Germany to greatness. Hitler and theNazis were tools of the Reptilians and their leading embodied agents like theRothschilds. They were used to create global conflict and provide the excuse fora Jewish homeland in Palestine.Bankrolling the NazisThose calling themselves Jewish have suffered terribly over the years from themanipulations and agenda of those who rule them. In Nazi Germany, the mass ofthe Ashkenazi people were treated grotesquely while their leaders collaboratedwith their fascist persecutors, who were funded by Ashkenazi bankers and theBritish and American elite, including the Bush family. President Boy Bush’sgrandfather, Prescott Bush, was involved with the (Rothschild-controlled)Harriman Empire in funding the Nazis through a company called the Union BankingCorporation (UBC). Virtually all Nazi trade with the United States was under thecontrol of Harriman (Rothschild) interests and the stewardship of people likePrescott Bush. The Union Bank interfaced with the steel and banking empire ofHitler funder, Fritz Thyssen, whose factories built the Nazi war machinery. TheUBC was closed down for trading with the enemy and one might ask whyprofessional ‘Nazi hunters’ like Simon Wiesenthal, and others, have neverpursued the Bush family? The hypocrisy is unbelievable, or it would be if youdidn’t know that ‘Nazi-hunters’ and the Bush family are expressions of the sameforce. The Bush–Nazi connection has been highlighted by John Loftus, presidentof the Florida Holocaust Museum, who pointed out that Prescott Bush derived aportion of his personal fortune from his affiliation with the UBC. Loftus, aformer prosecutor in the Justice Department’s Nazi War Crimes Unit, said thatleading Nazi industrialists secretly owned the ‘Harriman/Bush’ bank (controlledby the Rothschilds), and they were moving money into the UBC through a secondbank in Holland even after the United States declared war on Germany. The bankwas liquidated in 1951, Loftus said, and President Boy Bush’s grandfather, andgreat grandfather, Herbert Walker, received $1.5 million as part of thatdissolution. Herbert Walker is where the ‘H.W.’ comes from in Father Bush’sname. Loftus said he had a file of paperwork linking the bank and Prescott Bushto Nazi money. ‘That’s where the Bush family fortune came from: it came from theThird Reich’, Loftus said in a speech during the Sarasota Reading Festival in2001 (Figure 97). Loftus also said that the Rockefeller family had Nazi ties,something I have documented in detail in other books. The Rothschild-controlledRockfeller family funded the work of Ernst Rudin, Hitler’s foremost ‘racialhygienist’, at Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Eugenics, Anthropology andHuman Heredity. Other Nazi doctors, including ‘Angel of Death’ Josef Mengele,conducted incredibly cruel and vicious experiments on live, captive humansubjects. Writer and researcher, Anton Chaitkin, says that body parts fromvictims ‘were delivered to [Josef] Mengele, [Otmar] Verschuer and the otherRockefeller-linked contingent at the Wilhelm Institute’. The Reptilian hybridfamilies, primarily the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Harrimans were behind therace purity eugenics movement. They see themselves as the master race, thebloodline of the Reptilian ‘gods’, while everyone else is merely cattle. See AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free for the background.Image [../Images/00102.jpg]Figure 97: Says it all … The Khazar-Sumerian NazisAt first hearing, it would seem crazy that elite American families would fundHitler and his race purity sickness – even more so ‘Jewish’ families like theRothschilds and others. When you realise that we are looking at Reptilian hybrid‘royal’ bloodlines within the every race and nation, and that they are workingtogether to the common goal, it starts to make sense. It would explain whyAlfred Rosenberg, the ‘intellectual leader’ of the Nazi Party, is reported tohave had ‘Jewish’ [that is Ashkenazi/Khazar/Sumerian] ancestry. It was Rosenbergwho gave the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to Hitler. These were purported toreveal plans for world domination and are alleged to have been presented at theJewish World Congress held in Basel, Switzerland, in 1897. The Protocols wereused to ‘justify’ the horrific persecution of Jews in Germany (although not theAshkenazi/Sumerian leaders involved with the Nazi Party). Rosenberg, who wasborn in Estonia, became editor of the Voelkischer Beobachter, the official NaziParty newspaper, and he wrote The Myth of the Twentieth Century which claimedthat the Aryan race was the creator of all values and culture, while the Jewswere agents of cultural corruption. Now we can see the real reason for the Naziobsession with the blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryan ‘master race’. It was theSum-Aryan race that interbred with the Reptilian ‘gods’, the Anunnaki. UnderRosenberg’s command, Jewish libraries throughout Europe were ransacked and thespoils delivered to him in Frankfurt. He also headed a special unit, EinsatzstabRosenberg, which plundered art and furniture belonging to Jews in occupiedWestern Europe. Why? Because there are the ‘Jewish’ people as a whole, and thenthere are the Sumerian–Reptilian hybrid bloodlines within the ‘Jewish’ people.The two are not the same, and that’s why these families supported the Nazis anddidn’t give a damn what they did to the rest of the ‘Jewish’ people. In fact,they wanted them to be treated horrifically to justify a ‘homeland’ (Rothschildfiefdom) in Israel after the war. Ernst Hanfstaengl, a close friend of USPresident Franklin Roosevelt, was also an associate of Hitler before the war. Hesays he was warned by the Austrian writer, Rudolf Kommer, that ‘if any politicalparty emerges with an anti-Semitic programme directed by Jewish, or half-Jewish,fanatics we shall have to watch out’. Hanfstaengl wrote that later, afterexperiencing the influence that Alfred Rosenberg had over Hitler, he began torealise what that remark really meant:> I thought back to Rudolf Kommer’s remark about an anti-Semitic programme> directed by Jewish or half Jewish fanatics – Rosenberg was distinctly Jewish> [Khazar] in appearance, although he would have been the first to protest> furiously if anyone had questioned his ancestry. Yet I used to see him most> mornings sitting in a dingy café at the corner of Briennerstrasse and> Augustenstrasse with a Hungarian Jew named Holoschi, who was one of his> principle assistants. The man called himself Hollander in Germany and was> another of these Jewish anti-Semites … I suspected the Aryan background of> many of the others. Strasser and Streicher looked Jewish to me as well as> figures like Ley, Frank and even Goebbels, who would have had difficulty in> proving their pedigree. They were ‘Aryan’ – Sum-Aryan – but Hanfstaengl would not have understood thegame. Never mind Rosenberg’s own ancestry, what was he doing with a ‘principleassistant’ that was Jewish when Rosenberg was one of the major architects of themaster race madness and the persecution of Jews? This is one of endless‘anomalies’ that can only be explained when you realise that the Jewish massesand their elite ‘leadership’ are working to very different agendas. The GermanAshkenazi banker, the Rothschild-controlled Max Warburg, was a director of I. G.Farben, the chemical and pharmaceutical giant that funded the Nazis, ran theconcentration camp at Auschwitz and was at the heart of Hitler’s war machine.His Rothschild-controlled brother, Paul Warburg, who was behind the creation ofthe Federal Reserve banking system that controls the American economy, was adirector of Farben’s US arm. Moshe Gottlieb reveals in his book, AmericanAnti-Nazi Resistance ‘33 – ‘41, that Max Warburg’s son, Erich, cabled hiscousin, Frederick Warburg, a director of the Union Pacific Railroad, telling himto use all his influence to stop anti-Nazi propaganda and activity in America,including ‘atrocity news and unfriendly propaganda in foreign press, massmeetings, etc.’. Frederick cabled back to Erich: ‘No responsible groups here[are] urging [a] boycott [of] German goods, merely excited individuals’. Twodays later, on March 31st 1933, the Warburg-controlled American Jewish Committeeand the Rothschild’s B’nai B’rith, heavily influenced by the Sultzbergers of TheNew York Times, issued an official joint statement saying ‘no American boycottagainst Germany be encouraged’. It advised ‘no further mass meetings be held orsimilar forms of agitation be employed’. Journalist John L. Spivak exposed theWarburg connections to the Nazis in an article in 1934, headed ‘Wall Street’sFascist Conspiracy’. He revealed that the Warburgs controlled the AmericanJewish Committee that opposed the anti-Nazi boycott, while the Rothschild bank,Kuhn Loeb and Co., run by Russian Revolution funder, Jacob Schiff, hadunderwritten Nazi shipping. Spivak further exposed the Warburgs for financingpro-fascist political activities through their partners and allies, many of whomwere major figures in the American Jewish Committee and B’nai B’rith, or ‘Sonsof the Covenant’. Support for the Nazis by the Ashkenazi (Khazar) leadership wasfundamental to Hitler’s war machine, and this led directly to the unimaginablesuffering of the Ashkenazi masses in Germany. It was this very suffering thatthe Ashkenazi ‘leaders’, most notably the Rothschilds, exploited to campaign fora homeland in Israel – a land to which the Ashkenazi had no blood or historicalconnection whatsoever. After the war, leading Zionist fronts continued tosupport right-wing groups or ignore their actions when it suited them. Canadianwriter, Greg Felton, said this of the Zionist support for the Nazis:> Israel would not be possible today if the World Zionist Congress and other> Zionist agencies hadn’t formed common cause with Hitler’s exterminators to rid> Europe of Jews. In exchange for helping round up non-Zionist Jews, sabotage> Jewish resistance movements and betray the trust of Jews, Zionists secured for> themselves safe passage to Palestine. This arrangement was formalized in a> number of emigration agreements signed in 1938. The most notorious case of> Zionist collusion concerned Dr Rudolf Kastner, Chairman of the Zionist> Organization in [Khazar] Hungary from 1943-45. To secure the safe passage of> 600 Zionists to Palestine, he helped the Nazis send 800,000 Hungarian Jews to> their deaths. The Israeli Supreme Court virtually whitewashed Kastner’s crimes> because to admit them would have denied Israel the moral right to exist. Or, as David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, said in a letter tothe Zionist executive on December 17th, 1938:> The saving of Jewish lives from Hitler is considered here as a potential> threat to Zionism, unless they are brought to Palestine. When Zionism had to> choose between the Jewish people and the Jewish state, it unhesitatingly> preferred the latter. The lands that the Rothschilds and their agents wished to occupy were populatedat the time by the Arabs or Palestinians, but there was always going to be onlyone fate for them. Former Israel Prime Minster, Yitzhak Rabin, said in anuncensored version of his memoirs, published in The New York Times on October23rd 1979:> We walked outside, Ben-Gurion accompanying us. Allon repeated his question –> ‘What is to be done with the Palestinian population?’ Ben-Gurion waved his> hand in a gesture which said ‘Drive them out!’ Image [../Images/00103.jpg]Figure 98: An Irgun poster And that’s what they did. The Arabs were driven out of power or consequence intheir own land by Zionist terrorist groups like Hagana, Irgun and the Stern Gang(also known as Lehi), who bombed and assassinated Arabs, fellow Jews and theBritish administrators who governed Palestine under a mandate from the League ofNations and the Versailles Peace Conference. ‘Palestine’ was then the region wenow call Israel, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the lands formerlybelonging to the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Zionist terrorism led to the impositionof the Jewish state in 1948 when at least 750,000 Arab people were expelled fromtheir own land.Among the leaders of the Zionist terror groups were Menachem Begin, YitzhakShamir and Ariel Sharon. These Ashkenazi (Khazar/Sumerian) terrorists andbutchers would become Israeli prime ministers and have the nerve to condemn Arabterrorism. The Stern Gang was named by the British after its first commander,Avraham Stern, who later formed his own group, Irgun Zvai Leumi be-Yisrael(National Military Organization in Israel). An Internet article describes hismotivation:> ... Stern believed that the Jewish population should focus its efforts on> fighting the British rather than supporting them in World War II; and that> forceful methods were an effective means to achieve those goals. He> differentiated between ‘enemies of the Jewish people’ (e.g., the British) and> ‘Jew haters’, (e.g., the Nazis), believing that the former needed to be> defeated, and the latter neutralized. To this end, he initiated contact with> Nazi authorities offering an alliance with Germany in return for transferring> Europe’s Jews to Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state therein. This had always been the true motivation of these manipulators, and they havetreated Jewish people as a whole as cattle to be exploited at will to this end.Irgun, led by later Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, was responsible for thebombing of the British headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in1946. It killed 91 Britons, Arabs and Jews, injuring many more, and this wasonly one of a stream of terrorist outrages and assassinations that ended in thecreation of Israel (Figure 98). As an article on the World Socialist Websitepointed out during the reign of Prime Minister Sharon:> It is not simply that Ariel Sharon and company are a bunch of hypocrites or> political amnesiacs about the past. More importantly, the Irgun, led by> Menachem Begin, the Stern Group and Lehi, its successor, went on to form the> Herut party, forerunner of the Likud party, and the ultra right-wing Moledet> party, which form the main coalition partners of Sharon’s government. > The gang of former generals, ultra-nationalists and religious bigots that run> Israel today are the political heirs of terrorists who furthermore had close> connections with the fascists. In this, they mirrored some of the Arab> nationalists in Palestine, Egypt and Iraq who allied themselves with Germany> in order to rid themselves of British imperialism. These alliances led to a> virtual civil war between the various wings of the Zionist movement during> World War II. Greg Felton, the Canadian writer and specialist on Middle East affairs, wrote:> … What we know as the ‘Jewish State’ of Israel is really an ethnocentric> garrison state established by a non-Semitic people for the declared purpose of> dispossessing and terrorizing a civilian Semitic people. In fact from Nov. 27,> 1947, to May 15, 1948, more than 300,000 Arabs were forced from their homes> and villages. By the end of the year, the number was close to 800,000 by> Israeli estimates. Today, Palestinian refugees number in the millions. Apartheid IsraelLike all societies controlled by the Reptilian hybrids, Israel is extremelyhierarchical and racist. The Reptilians are obsessed with hierarchicalstructures, in line with the traits of the reptilian brain, or computer program.As Stewart Swerdlow says, the caste system of India, which dictates your placein society for life by your genetics, was based on the Reptilians’ own genetichierarchy. Caste comes from the word casta, meaning race or lineage, and, to theReptilian hybrids, everything is about lineage. The Israeli leadership isstunningly racist about Arab people (except those with the bloodline). I saw aformer Israel military commander saying during the Israel–Lebanon conflict of2006 that it was terrible how Israeli children had to be sitting in bombshelters in Haifa. As she spoke those words, children were being killed byIsraeli bombs in Lebanon, but they didn’t matter. The Israeli Prime Minister andterrorist, Menachem Begin, told the Israeli parliament that Palestinians ‘arebeasts walking on two legs’, and another Prime Minister and terrorist, YitzhakShamir, said in a speech to Jewish settlers that the Palestinians ‘would becrushed like grasshoppers ... heads smashed against the boulders and walls’.That is what they really think. Have no illusions here, Arabs and the rest ofthe world’s peoples are seen as inferior beings – little more than vermin. InJune 2006, the Israeli Navy shelled a beach in Gaza killing eight Palestiniansand injuring thirty-two civilians, including thirteen children. The deadincluded seven members of one family (Figures 99 and 100, overleaf). The Israeligovernment offered its ‘deep regret’, but this outrage was no accident. To them,dead Palestinians are the only kind they want. What can you say when Israelichildren are encouraged to sign and write messages on bombs destined for Arabchildren (Figures 101 and 102, overleaf). The Israeli army captures children asyoung as twelve for the ‘crime’ of throwing stones at tanks destroying theircommunities. These children are kept in adult military prisons and they are‘tried’ in military courts – all against international law. But, then, Israel isa law unto itself. The Israeli authorities have no empathy with the victims oftheir callousness, not least because, to them, Palestinians are geneticallyinferior to the ‘Chosen Race’.But Israel’s apartheid goes much deeper than that. Even the ‘Jewish’ populationis divided into levels of privilege decided by genetic origin. The whiteAshkenazim from Europe and America are, by law, at the top of the pyramid ofprivilege. Below them in Israel’s genetic caste system are the Sephardic Jews,or Mizrahim (the ‘Eastern Ones’), who came from Arab countries and do have anhistorical connection to the Middle East. Sephardic people are descended from‘Jews’ who were expelled from Spain in 1492. They lived in peace with the Arabsfor hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years before the Ashkenazi arrived innumbers from Europe in the mid-20th century under the banner of the Rothschildpolitical movement called Zionism. Rabbi Ahron Cohen said in a statement for theanti-Zionist Neturei Karta group that the connection between Muslims and Jewsgoes right back into ancient history. ‘Mostly the relationship was friendly andmutually beneficial’, he said. ‘Historically, the situation frequently was thatwhen Jews were being persecuted in Europe they found refuge in the variousMuslim countries. Our attitude to Muslims and Arabs can only be one offriendliness and respect.’ Sephardic Jews were kept in corrugated iron transitcamps where Ashkenazi officials tried to strip them of their ‘Arabness’ byreplacing their ‘unpronounceable’ Arab names with good ‘Jewish’ ones. Most hadto work ten to twelve hours a day in disease and squalor. Their high death ratewas explained by one Zionist official as a ‘common and natural thing’. YemeniJews, in particular, faced extraordinary discrimination as they weretransported, often against their wishes, from Yemen to Israel and held inprimitive camps. Yemeni babies were stolen from their mothers and given foradoption to Ashkenazi families. Doctors, social workers and nurses workedtogether to kidnap 600 Yemeni-Jewish babies. They told their parents thechildren had died and then gave them to childless Ashkenazi couples. In theearly 1990s, a high-profile campaign began to reunite some of those shatteredfamilies. Professor Ella Habiba Shohat, an Iraqi-Jewish Israeli who teaches atCity University of New York in Manhattan, has highlighted the suppression ofSephardic Jews in Israel. Her 1992 book, Israeli Cinema: East/West and thePolitics of Representation, shook the Israeli establishment with its exposure ofracism. She said of her upbringing in Israel:> It was taboo to speak Arabic in school and whenever teachers wanted to> chastise us, they would refer to us as ‘you Moroccan’ or ‘you Iraqi’ or ‘you> Yemeni’ … Jews from the Middle East were expected to abandon their Middle> Eastern traits, so we grew up without studying our history or culture. It was> all the more tragic for Palestinian Israelis, who couldn’t even read about> Arab history in textbooks. Image [../Images/00104.jpg]Figure 99: A photograph released by the Israeli army shows an Israeli Navyvessel shelling a beach in the northern Gaza Strip on June 9th 2006 … Image [../Images/00105.jpg]Figure 100: … Huda Ghalya screaming alongside the body of her father after theIsraeli attack. Huda lost seven members of her family – across three generations– on that Gaza beach. Yet, Israel still has the nerve to condemn the terrorismof others Image [../Images/00106.jpg]Figure 101: What a way to bring up your children … Israeli kids writing messageson the bombs waiting to be fired at Lebanese civilians and children just likethem … Image [../Images/00107.jpg]Figure 102: … Message received … At the bottom of the ‘Jewish’ genetic pile in the apartheid of ‘free,democratic’ Israel, come the black Jews from Ethiopia, who are treatedappallingly, but even they are placed by law above the Palestinians. Israel is afundamentally racist state in which the Ashkenazim dominate and dictate to theSephardic/Arab majority on the basis of genetic origin. A report by the USorganisation, Human Rights Watch, said:> There is no general prohibition of discrimination or guarantee of equality in> any of Israel’s Basic Laws. Indeed, equality was explicitly excluded from the> Basic Law: Human Freedom and Dignity when it was drafted. One man’s experience …Jack Bernstein, an American Ashkenazi, moved to Israel from the United States,lured by the propaganda about the Jewish homeland. What he experienced sickenedhim and he detailed what he witnessed in an article entitled ‘The Life of anAmerican Jew in Racist-Marxist Israel’. He said that Zionist propaganda has ledthe American people to believe that Zionism and Judaism are one and the same andthat they are religious in nature. This, he said, was a blatant lie. ‘Judaism isa religion; but Zionism is a political movement started mainly by East European(Ashkenazi) Jews, who for centuries have been the main force behind communismand socialism’, he writes. The ultimate goal of the Zionists, said Bernstein, isa one-world government under the control of the Zionists and theZionist-oriented international bankers. He said that after the l967 Arab-Israeliwar Jews in America were filled with pride that ‘our homeland’ had become sopowerful and successful. They had also been manipulated by false propaganda thatJews in America were being persecuted, he said. ‘So, between l967 and l970,approximately 50,000 American Jews fell for this Zionist propaganda and migratedto Israel. I was one of those suckers’. Bernstein had no emotional conflict withleaving the United States, because those calling themselves Jews are allowed tohave citizenship of both Israel and America. Soon after arriving in Israel,Bernstein fell in love with Ziva – ‘She was a Sephardic Jewess from Iraq who,like myself, had fallen for the Zionist propaganda and had migrated to Israel’.Jack and Ziva were married and that’s when he realised he was living in a raciststate. He said that for the first three years of their marriage they had to livewith Ziva’s aunt ‘because of the critical housing shortage in Israel and becauseof racism’. He said this was the genetic system used to allot housing:> 1)First choice goes to Ashkenazim who have lived in Israel for many years.> 2)Second in line are Ashkenazim from Europe, especially if they marry an> Israel-born Ashkenazi.> 3)Third, are Ashkenazim from the United States, even better if they marry an> Israel-born Ashkenazi.> 4)Only after all of the above are housed do Sephardic Jews, with an historical> connection to this region, have a choice of whatever is left.> 5)At the bottom of the list come the Muslims, Druze and Christians.Jack Bernstein writes that even though he was an Ashkenazi from the UnitedStates, he was placed lower on the list for housing for being married to aSephardic Jewess. He said that employment opportunities were allocated in thesame way: the Ashkenazim get the best jobs; Sephardic Jews are next; whileMuslims, Druze and Christians filled the menial jobs with a great many leftunemployed. The Shas Party in Israel was specifically formed to address thediscrimination against Sephardic people by the Ashkenazi elite. Israel isfounded on outrageous racism of the most appalling and sinister nature. It is noless than apartheid, yet Ashkenazi organisations like the Rothschild-controlledAnti-Defamation League (ADL) and B’nai B’rith go around hurling the label‘racist’ and ‘anti-Semite’ at everyone else to stop legitimate investigationinto the activities of people like the Rothschilds and Henry Kissinger. JackBernstein dismissed the very idea that Israel is either free or democratic. Itis, he said, a racist state:> The Ashkenazi Jews, who migrated to Israel from Germany, while sympathetic to> communism and support it, tend to favor the practices of Nazi-style fascism.> During World War II in Germany these elite Zionist Ashkenazi Jews worked> closely with Hitler’s Gestapo in persecuting the lower class German Jews and> delivering them to concentration camps. Now living in Israel, these elite> Zionist Jews, who were well trained in Nazi-style fascism and favor it, have> imposed many facets of fascism on Israel. To give the impression that Israel> is a democracy, members of the Knesset [Israel’s parliament built by the> Rothschilds] are elected – but it’s an odd kind of election. This is where> Israel’s so-called democracy stops. It doesn’t make any difference which party> wins an election, the Likud or the Labor party [or now the Kadima], the elite> Zionist Jews rule in a dictatorial manner – giving favors to the elite clique> and brutally suppressing any dissent. > Concerning Nazism/fascism, please let me clear a point. Germans are an> admirable people – I dare say even great. But in Germany, the general> population were victims of the Nazis who through cunning and brutality gained> power. In Germany, the average Jews were victims of the Zionist elite who> worked hand in hand with the Nazis. Many of those same Zionist Jews, who, in> Germany, had worked with the Nazis, came to Israel and joined hands with the> Zionist/communist Jews from Poland and Russia. It is the two faces of> communism and Nazi-style fascism that rule Israel. Democracy is merely an> illusion. > Regarding the tie between the elite Ashkenazi Jews and the Nazis, take a look> at the word ‘Ashkenazi’ – look again – ‘AshkeNAZI’. Interesting isn’t it? The Ashkenazi leadership used people who are not Jewish by blood, and nothistorically-connected to the lands of Israel, to take over Palestine through anhistorical fabrication. They have controlled the country ever since as a fascistdictatorship masquerading as ‘freedom and democracy’. Ask former nucleartechnician, Mordechai Vanunu, who was illegally abducted in Rome by Mossadagents, smuggled back into Israel, ‘tried’ in secret and jailed for 18 years.His crime was to tell the truth about Israel’s nuclear weapons programme whichthe government had denied existed. Vanunu, the son of a rabbi, was released in2004, but remains subject to a long list of restrictions on what he can say, whohe can speak to and where he can go. He has been re-arrested a number of timesfor violation of the restrictions and talking to foreign journalists. TheBritish and American governments, those ‘protectors of freedom’, look the otherway.‘Jewish’ means ‘faith’, not raceThere is no such thing as a Jewish ‘race’, just as there is no Aryan ‘race’ inthe way it is portrayed by the white supremacists. These are more fabricationsof history. There are people who follow the Jewish faith all over the world, butthat’s different to a race. There are white ‘Jews’, brown ‘Jews’, black ‘Jews’,Spanish ‘Jews’, Chinese ‘Jews’ etc., etc, that follow that belief system andgood luck to them so long as they don’t force it on anyone else. If they want tocall themselves ‘Jewish’ on the basis of their faith then please feel free, it’snone of my business. But there is not a Jewish ‘race’, let alone a ‘chosenpeople’. Arthur Koestler points out that people calling themselves ‘Jewish’across the globe have far more in common genetically with the ‘host’ populationthan they do with each other. This was highlighted by Professor Juan Comas inhis work, The Race Question in Modern Science, published by UNESCO, and here byRaphael Patai in the Encyclopaedia Britannica:> The findings of physical anthropology show that, contrary to popular view,> there is no Jewish race. Anthropometric measurements of Jewish groups in many> parts of the world indicate that they differ greatly from one another with> respect to all the important physical characteristics – stature, weight, skin> colour, cephalic index, facial index, blood groups, etc. Harry Shapiro produced the same assessment in his UNESCO work, The JewishPeople: A Biological History:> The wide range of variation between Jewish populations in their physical> characteristics and the diversity of the gene frequencies of their blood> groups render any unified classification for them a contradiction in terms.> For although modern racial theory admits some degree of polymorphism or> variation within a racial group, it does not permit distinctly different> groups, measured by its own criteria of race, to be identified as one. To do> so would make the biological purposes of racial classification futile and the> whole procedure arbitrary and meaningless. Unfortunately, this subject is> rarely wholly divorced from non-biological considerations, and despite the> evidence efforts continue to be made to somehow segregate Jews as a distinct> racial entity. These efforts are designed to maintain the lie and continue to sell a falsehistory and biology, both to the mass of those who consider themselves ‘Jewish’,and to the rest of humanity. How can you claim to be a special race, a ‘chosenpeople’ considered by ‘God’ to be above all others, and with special rightsgiven by ‘God’ to own a certain piece of land, when there is no such thing as a‘Jewish race’? During the Babylonian exile, the ‘Israelites’, including membersof the priestly families, married with other peoples. As Koestler says in TheThirteenth Tribe, even before the Diaspora (the ‘Scattering’), the Israeliteswere a ‘thoroughly hybridized race’. Such ‘hybridization’ applies to mosthistoric nations, writes Koestler, ‘and the point would not need stressing if itwere not for the persistent myth of the biblical [‘Jewish’] tribe havingpreserved its racial purity throughout the ages’. (The mass of the peoplehaven’t, but their elite have). Koestler concludes his excellent book:> To sum up, the Jews of our day have no cultural tradition in common, merely> certain habits and behaviour-patterns, derived by social inheritance from the> traumatic experience of the ghetto, and from a religion which the majority> does not practice or believe in, but nevertheless confers on them a> pseudo-national status … the lingering influence of Judaism’s racial and> historical message, though based on illusion, acts as a powerful emotional> break by appealing to tribal loyalty. This continues to be done because Reptilian hybrids like the Rothschilds needthe myth of a ‘Jewish’ race, and a false ‘Jewish’ history, to hide their trueagenda.Image [../Images/00108.jpg]Figure 103: Freemasonic hero, Albert Pike, predicted three world wars and one isstill to come World War IIIThe creation of Israel was never an end in itself. It has always been a means toan end. All along, the plan has been to target the Islamic world to trigger aglobal war that would set the world ablaze and lead to the ‘solution’ ofcentralised control of the planet and all of its peoples. To do that they neededto create a point of conflict, a power keg, among the Arab countries that couldbe exploded to start another global war. This is the real reason for thecreation of Israel and the real reason why the Reptilian hybrid-controlledUnited States has spent its billions building up Israel’s might and military.Albert Pike (Figure 103), a Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry and Illuminati to the core, is alleged to have written a letter in1871 to an infamous Illuminati operative, Giuseppe Mazzini, in which he outlinedthe three world wars that would lead to global domination. The first war, he issupposed to have written, would overthrow the Czars in Russia through a conflictbetween the British and Germanic empires; and the second would lead to politicalZionism being strong enough to install a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine.Now, there are many who say the letter never existed, but what is interesting,in the light of current events, is what he is supposed to have said about WorldWar Three:> The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences> caused by the ‘agentu’ of the ‘Illuminati’ between the political Zionists and> the leaders of the Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that> Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism [the State of Israel]> mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile, the other nations, once more divided> on this issue, will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical,> moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion ... We shall unleash the Nihilists> and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in> all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute> atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. > Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world> minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of> civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose> deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious> for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive> the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of> Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view [the Reptilians]. This> manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will> follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and> exterminated at the same time. > Source: Commander William Guy Carr, former Intelligence Officer in the Royal> Canadian Navy, quoted in Satan: Prince of This World. If Pike did not write that, then the guy who did was some prophet. This is thehistorical background that has led to what is happening today.Silencing the truthThe Rothschilds, through their front organisations like B’nai B’rith and theWorld Jewish Congress, and front families like the Canadian Bronfmans, havesought to defend the lie and destroy researchers who get too close. Theirvehicle for this is the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), officially founded byB’nai B’rith in 1913, but the key man behind it was the Rothschild agent, JacobSchiff, of Kuhn Loeb and Co, who funded the Russian Revolution. The ADLviciously targets anyone uncovering the conspiracy and brands them‘anti-Semitic’. They have done this to me, which I take as a compliment. The ADLis an arm of the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, which is the modernversion of the private intelligence network that the Rothschilds establishedcenturies ago. They have succeeded in discrediting many researchers and writers,even getting some jailed for simply promoting another version of history. It isthe Rothschilds and their lackeys who are behind the laws in more and morecountries that make any questioning of the official story of the Holocaust acriminal offence. The United Nations is now seeking to make these laws global.The reason they are so terrified of independent Holocaust investigation is thatit has the potential, as the dominoes fall, to expose the whole Rothschildinvolvement with the Nazis and demolish the official Jewish history on which theRothschild conspiracy to a large degree depends. We have now reached the pointwhere even a teachers union debate in Canada about the treatment of thePalestinians by Israel is attacked and condemned by the Rothschild-controlledB’nai B’rith who sought to have it stopped. The desperation by thesemind-fascists to keep the lid on the truth is becoming almost laughable. TheRothschild cabal have to keep inventing new enemies for the ‘Jews’ to keep themcontrolled and demanding ‘protection’ from those who imprison them. The Jew,Albert Einstein, quoted in Collier’s Magazine in 1938, said:> Anti-Semitism is nothing but the antagonistic attitude produced in the non-Jew> by the Jewish group. The Jewish group has thrived on oppression and on the> antagonism it has forever met in the world ... the root cause is their use of> enemies they create in order to keep solidarity. Unfortunately, the ‘left’ and ‘liberals’ have bought the lie and the extremeright Rothschilds, and their ADL, use what I call the Robot Radicals to do theirdirty work by destroying legitimate researchers who are asking questions thatthe ‘RRs’ are too stupid and blind to ask. When an alleged ‘racist’ isidentified, the lynch mob grabs the rope. He or she must be destroyed, must layprostrate on the ground begging for forgiveness, for they have sinned againstthe God of Political Correctness – even if they weren’t being racist at all. Itnever seems to occur to the mob that in condemning the alleged ‘racist bully’ inthe terms that they do, they are engaging in the mass bullying of their target.But, they are too full of their own self-purity, too far up their own analpassages, to see their hypocrisy and contradiction. We now hear this cry of‘racism’ at every turn – a label guaranteed to attract hatred and condemnationfrom everyone who wants to posture their self-purity and show they are ‘notracist’. I am not a violent man, but if they had a rocket up their backside Icould well be tempted to ask for a match. Their contribution to human freedomand the exposure of those behind the slaughter, suffering and war, has beenutterly catastrophic and how the Rothschilds love ‘em.Okay, we have followed the Reptilian hybrid ‘royals’ through to the present dayby their various routes, and seen how they created their religions of masscontrol. Now, we can look at the secret society network, through which they haveimposed their will on an unsuspecting people."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 7 Hand in glove > Secrecy is the freedom tyrants dream of. > Bill Moyers As the bloodlines travelled and expanded their power, so did the secret societynetwork that emerged from the Mystery schools of Sumer, Babylon, Egypt andelsewhere. Its role is to covertly manipulate events to advance the Reptilianhybrid agenda and to install the bloodlines, or their stooges, into thepositions of political, economic and military power.The network is structured like Russian dolls, or pyramids within pyramids,smaller ones inside bigger ones, inside even bigger ones. The secret societiesare divided into levels or ‘degrees’ and each higher degree knows more than theone below (Figure 104, overleaf). You only progress to a higher level when youare chosen to do so, and the knowledge is strictly compartmentalised andrestricted. It is for this reason that most Freemasons know little or nothingabout the real goals of the organisation of which they are members. The generalmembership believes that the highest official degrees, like the 33rd degree ofthe Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, are truly as high as they can attain. This isnot so. The ‘individual’ secret societies feed bloodline initiates through thepeaks of their own pyramids and into the Illuminati degrees (Figure 105,overleaf). These, too, are compartmentalised and access to the highest levels isby Reptilian hybrid bloodline only. It is here that the real action is –knowledge of the game as it is truly played and to what end. There are alsoReptilian hybrid place-people throughout the lower secret societies, it shouldbe said, but they will have limited understanding compared with those deep inthe shadows. Albert Pike, who died in 1891, was among the most pre-eminentfigures in world Freemasonry and he was the guy who wrote the letter about thethree world wars. Pike described the structure of secret societycompartmentalisation in his book, Morals and Dogma, written for higher-degreeMasons. He was the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the 33rddegree and Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry, and he reveals in Moralsand Dogma how the lower degrees are purposely misled. He writes here about the‘Blue Degrees’, the bottom three levels of the Freemasonic structure, and thehighest level that most Freemasons attain:> The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the> symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by> false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but> it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them. Their true> implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princes of Masonry. Image [../Images/00109.jpg]Figure 104: The levels of ‘Degree’ within Freemasonry mean that knowledge can be‘compartmentalised’ and what the higher levels know the lower levels don’t. MostFreemasons never progress higher than the bottom three Degrees, the ‘BlueDegrees’ The Orwellian global state is being manipulated into place through theIlluminati secret society network, which ensures that its operatives or stoogesare appointed to the positions of power and influence. These are not justpoliticians, but crucially their ‘advisors’ and administrators, and those whocontrol banking, business, military and media. Their actions are coordinatedthrough the Illuminati web and the centrally-dictated decisions of the hiddenReptilian elite are implemented across the world by their agents in governmentand commerce. The compartmentalisation means that most secret society membersknow little, or mostly nothing, of the Reptilian agenda, and nor would theysupport it if they did. They have children, too, and they would be outraged ifthey knew how their society or group had been formed or infiltrated with the aimof creating a global fascist nightmare. Most secret society initiates use thesecrecy and exclusivity to plot and scheme to their benefit, be it influencingdecisions of the local council or securing a good business deal. When it comesto the big picture the overwhelming majority are clueless about the forces thatultimately control Freemasonry and other secret societies. Indeed, they are soclueless that they vehemently – and genuinely from their perspective – deny thatany such forces exist. This is how they keep most secret society initiates inignorance of what is happening around them. The pyramid structure of secretsocieties and the institutions of state ensure that only a few at the top knowwhat is really going on. The rest serve the pyramids from their isolatedcompartment with no idea how they are contributing to the imprisonment ofthemselves and their families. When I say ‘the top’, I don’t even mean those whoappear to be at the peaks of power, like presidents, prime ministers, CEOs,media owners and those with the most stars on their uniforms. Such people arethe place men and women of the Illuminati and they are there to do as they’retold. As long as they do so, they will be supported, but when they start tobelieve they really have power, or their demise suits the agenda, they will beremoved by whatever means. These include scandals about corruption or theirprivate life, which are covered up until it is time to remove them; or it couldmean undermining their government or business, so they are ejected by the publicor shareholders. When you control the media and finance, anything is possible.Image [../Images/00110.jpg]Figure 105: The chosen few progress through the pyramids of the ‘individual’secret societies into the secret Illuminati degrees, which are also fiercelyhierarchical. Entry to the upper levels is by Reptilian bloodline only Reptilian KnightsNaturally, some secret societies are more important and powerful than othersbecause some are closer to the top of the pyramid, or the ‘spider’ in the centreof the web – the Reptilian Shadow People. Among these exclusive groups are theKnights Templar and the Knights of Malta, both tools of the Roman Church, theChurch of Babylon. The official head of the Knights of Malta is the Pope, and italso has a Protestant version called the Knights Hospitaller of St John ofJerusalem or the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. Its official leaderis the British monarch. The Knights Templar became well known after thepublication of the book, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, in the 1980s, andthen world famous with the success of The Da Vinci Code, the ‘Holy Blood’ novelby Dan Brown. Both works are based on the idea that the ‘Jesus’ bloodline becamethe Merovingian kings. The Knights Templar, together with an alleged associatedsecret society called The Priory of Sion, and the Roman Catholic group, OpusDei, are said to know this secret and have worked to keep it hidden to protectthe official story of Christianity. Some of the claims in the books are correct,but swathes of them, and the main thrust about ‘Jesus’, are a diversion. Thesesecret societies and others are keeping a secret about bloodlines, but they arenothing to do with a literal ‘Jesus’ because there wasn’t one. ‘Jesus’ issymbolic of Nimrod/Tammuz in Babylon and, in that sense, ‘Jesus’ is symbolic ofthat bloodline – the Reptilian hybrids. Another ‘Grail’ writer, Sir LaurenceGardner, also promotes the Jesus bloodline story and actually calls it the‘Dragon’ lineage. Sir Laurence has been closely associated with the modernversion of the Royal Court of the Dragon, which was established and expanded bythe pharaohs in Egypt and has had Vlad Dracul – ‘Dracula’ – among its number.Given that background, I find it impossible to believe that Sir Laurence Gardnerdoesn’t know what the ‘Grail’ bloodline really refers to. These are the secretsheld and perpetuated by the Church of Rome, the Jesuits, Knights Templar,Knights of Malta, Opus Dei, the upper echelons of the Freemasons, and other evenmore exclusive groups.The Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem (laterthe Knights of Rhodes and now The Knights of Malta) were established in the11th/12th centuries, along with the Teutonic Knights, whose network would laterproduce, with the Rothschilds, the Nazi regime in Germany. These elite secretsocieties, which answer to the Church of Rome, involve leading names in globalpolitics, banking, business, military and media. The Knights Templar were formedin France and were first known as the Soldiers of Christ. They are surrounded inmystery and contradiction, but it is known that they dedicated the order to the‘Mother of God’ – Queen Semiramis of Babylon, the Anunnaki goddess under endlessnames. As with all such organisations, the Templars promoted a Christian imageas a cover and ‘Mother of God’ was taken to be Mother Mary, the mother of Jesus.The Templars adopted the symbol of the red cross on the white background, thefire or sun cross, and this became the ‘St George’s Cross’ of England. Thesymbol had already been in use for hundreds of years in Georgia in the CaucasusMountains, the land of Khazars, and its significance to the Reptilian hybridsgoes back way before the Templars. The flag was used during the Templar-ledCrusades and was flown by John and Sebastian Cabot when they ‘discovered’ NorthAmerica on behalf of the Templars and the Reptilian hybrids. Among other Templarsymbols were a flag with black and white squares; the skull and crossbones; andthe watchtower. All of these symbols have spanned the centuries with theReptilian hybrids. Black and white squares can be found on the floor of manychurches and cathedrals and on the uniforms of many police forces, includingthose in the UK and the USA (Figure 106). The symbol of the skull and crossboneshas been used in Knights Templar rituals for nine hundred years and it inspiredthe name and symbol of the elite Skull and Bones Society in the United Statesthat is closely connected to the Bush family (Figure 107). The Watchtower is thesymbol of the Watchtower Society – the Jehovah’s Witnesses.Image [../Images/00111.jpg]Figure 106: The symbol of black and white squares has been used in the Mysteryschools and secrets societies for aeons and it can be found on the floor ofMasonic temples, in ‘Christian’ churches and cathedrals, and on police uniforms Image [../Images/00112.jpg]Figure 107: The ancient Reptilian hybrid symbol of the skull and bones. This oneis the symbol of the Skull and Bones Society in the United States which includesmany of the ‘elite’ within the political establishment, including Boy and FatherBush from the Republicans and John Kerry from the Democrats From the start of the official Templar story there were blatant untruths. Theyclaimed to have been formed to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land, but for thefirst nine years, it seems, there were only nine of them. Among their mostimportant sponsors and supporters was St Bernard, founder of the CistercianOrder, and the French St Clair family. This became the Scottish Sinclair familyafter some of them settled in Scotland following the Norman invasion of Britainby William the Conqueror in 1066. The St Clair/Sinclairs are a Reptilian hybridbloodline who based themselves at Rosslyn Castle and Chapel, near Edinburgh inScotland, and later interbred with the Rothschilds. In 1099, Christian crusadersinvaded Jerusalem and slaughtered the Saracen Muslim Turks and the Judeansliving there. This reopened the ‘Holy City’ to Christian pilgrims and they beganto arrive in large numbers through the ports of Jaffa, Tyre and Acre. Tyre wasone of the major centres for a Sumerian people known as the Phoenicians, whoalso flew the red cross on the white background as they sailed far and wide,including to Britain around 3000 BC. The original nine Knights Templar arrivedin Jerusalem in 1118 to ‘guard’ the pilgrims, and were given quarters adjoiningTemple Mount, the alleged site of Solomon’s Temple. Some researchers believe theTemplars found something of great value, possibly manuscripts, while excavatingunder Temple Mount, but, whatever happened, events began to move rapidly after1126. It was then that the Grand Master, the French nobleman Hugues de Payens,left Jerusalem for France to gather recruits and expand the order. The word‘nobleman’, incidentally, means ‘Aryan man’ or ‘Sum-aryan man’. The Templarswere formally established on January 31st 1128 at the Council of Troyes – namedby the Sicambrian Franks after Troy, the former home of the Merovingian andRoman royal bloodlines.Image [../Images/00113.jpg]Figure 108: The Temple Church in London. It was originally built by the KnightsTemplar and consecrated in 1185 Image [../Images/00114.jpg]Figure 109: The flying reptile at the point where two great Reptilian hybridstrongholds meet: the City of London financial district, or ‘the City’, and theTemple district, headquarters of the legal profession Image [../Images/00115.jpg]Figure 110: Two winged reptiles and the red cross of the Knights Templar adornthe crest of the City of London, the ‘Square Mile’, which controls much ofglobal finance and is awash with interconnecting secret societies Within a year, incredible expansion had taken place. The Templars had a papalconstitution, wealth, land and three hundred recruits from noble families whohad to give all their wealth to the Templars when they joined. As a result, theTemplars owned land in France, England, Scotland, Spain and Portugal, and withinten years this was extended to Italy, Austria, Germany, Hungary andConstantinople. There were Templar preceptories and villages, hamlets and farmsgalore all over England. Whenever you see the name Temple in a British placename (for instance, Templecombe), it is a former Templar location. Theirnational headquarters was in London on land that is now High Holborn, and in1161 they moved a short distance to a new London Temple, which is still theretoday in the district called ‘The Temple’ and ‘Temple Bar’. Here can be foundparts of the original church, in the classic round design of the Templars, thatwas featured in The Da Vinci Code (Figure 108). It was close to this church inThe Temple, which is still a Knights Templar stronghold, that British PrimeMinister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, trained to be barristers. In the mainthoroughfare at Temple Bar is a statue of a flying reptile as you pass from theTemple district, the centre of the legal system, into the area of London knownas the City of London, or ‘the City’, the globally-important banking andfinancial district (Figure 109). The crest of ‘the City’ is two flying reptilesholding the shield of the Knights Templar (Figure 110).Despite their wealth, the Templars were exempt from taxes. They had their owncourts, and they controlled monarchs, people of influence, businesses andcountries (just as they do today). Their method, as with the later Rothschilds,was to manipulate their targets into a position of dependency, usually throughblackmail or debt. In this way, the Templars could dictate events. England’sEdward Ist borrowed substantial sums from the Templars, while King John andHenry III were up to their necks in debt to them. At one point, Henry pawned theCrown Jewels to the Templars to pay for military exploits. This is anotherancient technique of the Reptilian hybrids still constantly in use today. Theymanipulate wars, lend all sides the money to fight them, and pick up massiveprofits from the horrors they have secretly engineered. They also lend the samecountries money to rebuild their shattered societies, and this makes them evenmore in their debt and further under their control. They also use war to removeleaders, take over lands, and redraw the boundaries in line with their agenda.The English Crown Jewels at the time of King John were kept at the Templar’sLondon Temple and under John, Henry II, Henry III and Edward I, it was also oneof four royal treasuries. The Templars collected the taxes for the Pope and theCrown, plus the taxation known as tithes.In France, the Templar centre in Paris was the leading royal treasury and theFrench monarchy was in serious debt to them. The French king, Philippe IV, orPhilippe the Fair, decided, it seems, that he’d had enough and took steps todestroy the Templars in a purge on Friday, October 13th 1307. Friday the 13thhas been deemed unlucky ever since. Some Templars were seized, including theirGrand Master, Jacques de Molay, and they were subjected to the unimaginabletorture of the Inquisition, which accused them of taking part in skull and bonesrituals. But there is clear evidence that many Templars knew of the plan andescaped. Documents detailing their rules and rituals were removed or destroyedbefore the raids, and, when the vaults were opened at the Templar headquartersin Paris, the fortune Philippe so coveted was gone. The Templar fleet escapedfrom France, particularly from their main port at La Rochelle, and took theirwealth with them. They headed for Scotland, Portugal, and most likely, theAmericas. In Portugal, they hid behind an organisation known as the Knights ofChrist and one of their Grand Masters was the explorer Prince Henry theNavigator (1394-1460). The term ‘navigator’ or ‘nautonnier’ is used by theKnights Templar to denote a Grand Master. Significantly, Prince Henry had a seacaptain of noble birth called Bartolomeo Perestrello, whom he appointed governorof Porto Santo, an island thirty miles northeast of Madeira. Perestrello’sdaughter became the wife of Christopher Columbus and through these connections,and others, Columbus had access to maps of the world that the public knewnothing about. The Templars also fled from France to Scotland, aided by theSinclair family at Rosslyn Castle, and they would later re-emerge, in part, asthe Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Some researchers say that another secretsociety called the Priory of Sion was once closely connected with the KnightsTemplar, but later broke away. Division and conflict between secret societies isa constant theme and sometimes it may be true, although often it is a coverstory to hide the connections that form the web. The Priory of Sion is said tohave been founded in the 12th century to serve the interests of the Merovingianbloodline or ‘Le Serpent Rouge’ (the serpent blood), and has been heavily linkedwith the mysteries surrounding the village of Rennes le Chateau in southernFrance. It was this that first inspired the book, The Holy Blood and the HolyGrail. Others claim the Priory of Sion is a hoax, but within the many diversionsI suspect some basis of truth.While much has been written in recent years about the Knights Templar and OpusDei, the influence of the Knights of Malta and the Society of Jesus, or theJesuits, has been seriously underplayed. The Knights of Malta are one of themost powerful and elite groups within the Illuminati web and very close to thespider. The Jesuit hierarchy is even closer. The Knights of Malta control theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and much of global finance, and havePermanent Observer status at the United Nations. All this for a secret society.They began as the Knights Hospitaler of St. John of Jerusalem, a group ofreligious merchants who set up a hospital in Jerusalem in the eleventh century.Pope Pascal II acknowledged the Hospitalers as a religious order in 1113 andtheir leading initiates had to be of ‘noble birth’ – bloodline. They later addeda military wing and fought with the Templars in the Crusades. The Hospitalerswere exempt of all outside authority, except for the Pope, and, like theTemplars, paid no taxes. After they were forced out of Jerusalem by Islamicforces, they relocated in many places in the hundreds of years that followed.Most notable were the island of Rhodes, where they were known as the Knights ofRhodes, and Malta, where once again they took the name as their own. These twoplaces were also important locations for another former Sumerian people calledthe Danaans, who have been connected with the biblical ‘Tribe of Dan’. The name‘Danaan’ derived from their serpent Moon goddess, Dana, or Diana. They came outof Atlantis to settle in Asia Minor (now Turkey) and Greece, and also travelledto the British Isles, where they were known as ‘Tuatha de Danaan’, or ‘People ofthe Sea’. At one time, they had a major headquarters on the Island of Rhodes, aname that originates from a Syrian word for serpent. The Greek historian,Diodorus, said Danaan Mystery school initiates had the ability to heal, changethe weather and ‘shapeshift’ into any form. They also located in Malta, anothermajor Mystery school centre, and its original name was ‘Lato’, after ‘MotherLato’, the serpent goddess. It is no accident that the Knights of Malta settledin the same locations. When Napoleon conquered Malta in 1798, the now SovereignMilitary Order of Malta (SMOM) was without a home again until they moved toRome, where they still reside, in 1834. The Knights of Malta operate under theabsolute rule of the Grand Master who is elected for life. The symbol of theOrder is an eight-pointed cross, known as the Maltese Cross (Figure 111), and asymbol of the mother goddess.Image [../Images/00116.jpg]Figure 111: The Maltese cross, symbol of the Knights of Malta Image [../Images/00117.jpg]Figure 112: The Sun symbol of the Jesuit Order Loyola’s legacyThe Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits, with their Sun worship logo (Figure 112),operate in the highest echelons of the Reptilian hybrid Illuminati, or rathertheir leaders do. It is the Jesuit leadership that controls the Knights ofMalta, Knights Templar, Knights of Columbus in the USA, and works closely withanother secret order of the Roman Church, Opus Dei, which was created byJesuits. The alleged rivalry between the two is a diversion. The Society ofJesus was the creation of Ignatius Loyola, who was born at the Castle of Loyolain the Basque province of Guipúzcoa in Spain on Christmas Eve 1491. He and agroup of associates founded the Jesuit Order in 1537 and it was given papalapproval in 1540. From there it expanded its influence until it reached itspresent status as one of the most powerful secret societies on earth. Loyolabecame the first Jesuit Superior General, also known as the ‘Father General’,and he sent his agents far and wide to set up schools, colleges, and seminaries.It’s interesting that theological colleges are called ‘seminaries’ and theirstudents ‘seminarians’. The term comes from the Latin ‘seminarium’, or‘seed-bed’. Semiramis was known in similar terms as the mother, or ‘seed-bed’,of the gods. The word ‘seminary’ is also used in reference to Jewish and Muslimreligious centres of higher ‘education’, and by the Mormons, too. The Jesuitsnow have some 25,000 members in 112 countries and the worldwide structureconsists of regions known as assistances, which are themselves made up ofprovinces. It is the usual top-down, Russian-doll system that allows the leadersto keep the big agenda from the lower ranks. The Superior General has absoluteauthority and is again chosen for life, or until he decides to resign. TheJesuit Constitutions were written by Loyola and created a dictatorship thatdemanded absolute obedience to the Pope and ‘superiors’ within the Order. Hesaid that Jesuits should be ‘well-disciplined like a corpse’. Loyola produced abook called Spiritual Exercises in 1548 and it is still at the heart of Jesuit‘education’. It tells Jesuits to suspend their own judgement and the thirteenthrule says it is a virtue to believe only what the Catholic Church tells them –even if it’s not true. The example is given of seeing something that isobviously white, but believing it is really black if the Catholic hierarchy saysit is. This is what the Illuminati and Reptilian hybrids always demand –absolute obedience.In the Jesuit Extreme Oath of Induction, or Blood Oath ceremony, recorded in theJournals of the 62nd Congress, 3rd Session of the USA, the real aims of theSociety of Jesus are made crystal clear. Former Jesuit priests, including thelate Father Alberto Rivera, have confirmed the Blood Oath’s existence and itfits the blueprint of Reptilian hybrid rituals and oaths. Malachi Martin,another former Jesuit priest, worked in the inner circles of the Vatican formore than twenty years and spoke seventeen languages. In his final book beforehe died in 1999, he said there was an ‘occult conspiracy’ in the Vatican andthat satanic rituals were conducted within a Secret Church dedicated to‘Lucifer’. This is the true agenda behind the Jesuit operation which controlsthe Vatican and the Pope, and I know from unwilling participants that exactlythe same happens within the secret levels of the Mormon Church and the others ofReptilian hybrid origin. The Blood Oath ceremony is conducted alongside an altaras the initiate, or postulant, stands between two monks. One is holding a bannerwith the papal colours of yellow and white, and the other holds a black bannerbearing a knife with a red cross above the skull and crossbones. It alsoincludes the letters INRI, which is said to mean IUSTUM, NECAR, REGES, IMPIOUS –‘It is just to exterminate or annihilate impious or heretical Kings,Governments, or Rulers’. The initiate kneels and the Superior gives him a blackcrucifix to hold against his heart and a dagger which he holds pointing to hisheart. The Superior confirms during the ceremony that the initiate has beentaught to infiltrate and spy on behalf of the Order:> My son, heretofore you have been taught to act the dissembler: among Roman> Catholics to be a Roman Catholic, and to be a spy even among your own> brethren; to believe no man, to trust no man … and obtaining their confidence,> to seek even to preach from their pulpits and to denounce with all vehemence> in your nature our Holy Religion and the Pope; and even to descend so low as> to become a Jew among Jews, that you might be enabled to gather together all> information for the benefit of your Order … > … You have been taught to plant insidiously the seeds of jealousy and hatred> between communities, provinces, states that were at peace, and to incite them> to deeds of blood, involving them in war with each other, and to create> revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and prosperous … > … to take sides with the combatants and to act secretly with your brother> Jesuit, who might be engaged on the other side. You have been taught your duty> as a spy, to gather all statistics, facts and information in your power from> every source; to integrate yourself into the confidence of the family circle> of protestants and heretics of every class and character, as well as that of> the merchant, the banker, the lawyer, among the schools and universities, in> parliaments and legislatures, and the judiciaries and councils of state, and> to be all things to all men. The initiate then pledges to wage war against the ‘enemies’ of both the Orderand the Pope:> I furthermore promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make> and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants> and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from> the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or> condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive> these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and> crush their infants’ heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever> their execrable race. > That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned> cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet,> regardless of the honour, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or> persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as> I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of> the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus. The Order’s current head, or Superior General, is a Dutch guy called Peter-HansKolvenbach, also known by Jesuit-watchers as the ‘Black Pope’. He is far morepowerful than the real one and works closely in America with New York ArchbishopEdward Cardinal Egan. The fundamental involvement of the Jesuit Order inworld-changing events like the two global wars have rarely been told. Oftenblame is handed only to a ‘Jewish’ cabal, which certainly does exist as aSumerian cabal in a nexus around the Rothschilds, and goes under the name ofZionism, Neoconservatism and other labels. This is an important tool of theIlluminati, but it is only part of the web and we should not let it hide thefundamental involvement of the Jesuit hierarchy and the Church of Babylon, nowknown as the Roman Catholic Church. In truth, they are all different faces ofthe same organisation.The Jesuit blueprintThe same Jesuit structure was employed by the Jesuit-educated, Adam Weishaupt,when the Bavarian Illuminati was officially launched on May 1st, 1776, and bymany other secret groupings. The Bavarian Illuminati is a strand in the biggerweb, which also calls itself the Illuminati and goes back in various forms toAtlantis and Mu. Weishaupt taught Roman Catholic Canon Law at the JesuitUniversity of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Germany, which is the birthplace of manyReptilian hybrid front men, including Henry Kissinger and the current Pope, andbeloved by the Nazis. Germany, together with countries like Britain, France,Italy and the United States are major Illuminati and Reptilian bloodline centresto this day. The themes of the Jesuit Oath were adopted by Weishaupt, as he andhis conspirators set about causing mayhem in Europe, and elsewhere, to establishIlluminati political control. This was achieved by planting agents in all areasof society, who then engineered the conflict that brought about the requiredchange. The French Revolution was one of their covert operations disguised asgiving freedom to the people, and behind all these activities was the Jesuitleadership and its associates, the Rothschilds. Mayer Amschel Rothschild was thereal leader of the Bavarian Illuminati, and the Rothschilds and the Jesuits havelong been connected. Adam Weishaupt came from a family of Orthodox AshkenaziJews who had converted to Roman Catholicism, but, in reality, both religions aretwo wings of the same organisation. Rothschild, Weishaupt and the Jesuitleadership were dedicated to dividing and ruling the masses through conflict andwar by manipulating politics, finance and religion, and getting people to fighteach other while they were controlling and arming all sides. Weishaupt, or‘Brother Spartacus’ within the Illuminati, infiltrated the Freemasons,especially Grand Orient Freemasonry. He once said:> The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment; let it never appear> in any place in its own name, but always covered by another name, and another> occupation. None is fitter than the three lower degrees of Freemasonry; the> public is accustomed to it, expects little from it, and therefore takes little> notice of it. In 1785, a courier for the Bavarian Illuminati was struck by lightning, thrownfrom his horse and killed. He was carrying papers that detailed the plans tocontrol Freemasonry and governments and it will be familiar to observers of theworld today:> 1)They planned to use financial and sexual bribery to control those in> positions of power and blackmail them into following orders. If this didn’t> work, the targets and their families would be threatened with violence and,> when necessary, murdered.> 2)Education establishments, especially universities, would be used to> indoctrinate students from influential families into a belief in the need for> a world government and what has become known today as ‘globalisation’. One> method was to give scholarships to those ‘scouted’ by the Illuminati as> potential agents of the future.> 3)Those controlled by the Illuminati through bribery, blackmail or> indoctrination, were to be placed throughout governments, the military> hierarchy, religion, banking, commerce and academia to serve the Illuminati> conspiracy to impose a centralised global dictatorship.> 4)They would own or control all forms of mass communication to ensure that> news and information would portray the world as the Illuminati wanted the> people to see it.In 1798, John Robinson, a Freemason professor of natural philosophy at EdinburghUniversity in Scotland, wrote a book called Proofs of a Conspiracy that exposedthe Bavarian Illuminati. The professor said that he had been asked to join them,but refused. He said ‘an association has been formed for the express purposes ofrooting out all the religious establishments and overturning all existinggovernments … the leaders would rule the world with uncontrollable power, whileall the rest would be employed as tools of the ambition of their unknownsuperiors’. A copy was sent to US President George Washington, who acknowledgedthat the Illuminati were operating in the United States and had ‘diabolicaltenets’. My own view is that he had good reason to know – he was one of theirpeople. Weishaupt said that his followers, or ‘pupils’, should not be concernedabout using violence and breaking the law to achieve their ends (see 9/11). ‘Sinis only that which is hurtful, and if the profit is greater than the damage, itbecomes a virtue’ (see 9/11). He was confident of ‘victory’ for his bunch ofcrazies:> The pupils are convinced that the Order will rule the world. Every member> therefore becomes a ruler. We all think of ourselves as qualified to rule. It> is therefore an alluring thought both to good and bad men. Therefore the Order> will spread. And it has. Weishaupt worked with the ‘Law of Fives’, because he believed thateverything happened in cycles of five. The inner council of the BavarianIlluminati was arranged in line with the five points of the pentagram, the mostobvious symbol of Satanism. It was made up of five men, Meyer AmschelRothschild, Adam Weishaupt, his friend Franz Kolmer, Alphonse Donatién de Sade(de Sadist) and Sir Francis Dashwood, the British government minister and friendof Benjamin Franklin, who established the satanic Hellfire Club on the Dashwoodestate near West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. There were three main classeswithin the Bavarian Illuminati, the novices or ‘minervals’; a middle section of‘ordinary knights’; and the mystery grade, which was divided into two sectionsfor the ‘priest and regent’ and the ‘magus and king’, also known as IlluminatusRex. Lesser members made a pledge of obedience to those above them. Each had toagree in writing to keep the secrets, even though the lower levels were not toldthe truth anyway – the same with Freemasons and all such societies. Every monththe initiate had to produce a report to his superior who, thanks tocompartmentalisation, he didn’t even know. It is sobering to think that those inpositions of political, economic, military, business, media, scientific andacademic power today are members of organisations in which the demands of thesecret society come first, last and always.Jesuit NazisNot only was Adam Weishaupt Jesuit-educated and controlled, so was Joseph Stalinand many of the key Nazis. Hermann Rauschning, former Nazi head of the Danziggovernment, revealed in 1939 that Hitler had told him:> I learned much from the Order of the Jesuits. Until now there has never been> anything more grandiose on the Earth, than the hierarchical organization of> the Catholic Church. I transferred much of this organization into my own> [Nazi] party. In my Burgs of the Order, we will raise up a youth that will> make the world tremble … Walter Schellenberg, former chief of German counter-espionage, also quotedHitler as saying:> The S.S. organization has been constituted by Himmler according to the> principles of the Jesuit Order. Their regulations and the spiritual exercises> prescribed by Ignatius of Loyola were the model Himmler tried to copy exactly.> Himmler’s title as supreme chief of the S.S. was to be the equivalent to the> Jesuit General and the whole structure and direction was a close imitation of> the Catholic Church’s hierarchical order. Hitler, Himmler, the Jesuit-trained Goebbels, and most of the major Nazis wereCatholics and this is why there was so much cooperation and collaborationbetween Nazi Germany and the Vatican, as endlessly revealed in the decadessince. The Knights of Malta coordinated the escape of the most vicious Nazis,scientists and mind manipulators, and many were issued with Knights of Maltapassports. They ran the ‘Ratlines’, with other connected groups, that allowedsome 30,000 Nazis to relocate to the United States, Canada, Britain, SouthAmerica and Australia/New Zealand. Also involved were the Rockefeller family,James Jesus Angleton, the major US intelligence operative and Knight of Malta,and Herbert Walker, the grandfather of President George H.W. Bush and greatgrandfather to President George W. They all profited handsomely, it seems. Thepeople they helped to escape included Martin Bormann, the Deputy Fuhrer; JosephMengele, the ‘Angel of Death’ at Auschwitz, who was taken to the Americas tocontinue his genetic and mind-control horrors; Adolf Eichmann, who oversaw themass deportation to the concentration camps; Franz Stangl, Commandant of theTreblinka camp; Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo officer known as the ‘Butcher ofLyons’; and 8,000 members of the Waffen SS who were allowed to go free inBritain. Hitler’s one-time ally, Benito Mussolini, was also Vatican (in otherwords Jesuit)- controlled, as you would expect. All these connections arepossible when you have an interconnecting network involving the Jesuits, Knightsof Malta, Knights Templar and the Germany-based Teutonic Knights, which spanborders and nations.International finance appears to be controlled by ‘Jewish’ families, butalongside them are the Knights of Malta, an arm of the Jesuit Superior General,and I know from my own research over many years that the Knights of Malta are apower behind the global banking system. It is they who administrate theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), as I mentioned. An acquaintance of minecalled me to say he had been offered a job with the IMF by the Knights of Maltaat a meeting in Las Vegas. When he asked how they could possibly make such anoffer, he was told that they ran the whole thing and to get the job he wouldhave to join them. He turned them down and ended up in jail. The Rothschildswere given the title ‘Guardians of the Vatican Treasury’ and they ensure thefinancial wealth and secrets of the Roman Church stay well hidden, because theyand the leadership of the Roman Church are the same Reptilian/Anunnaki hybridsfrom Sumer. F. Tupper Saussy, author of the book, Rulers of Evil, wrote:> Aware that the Rothschilds are an important Jewish family, I looked them up in> [the] Encyclopedia Judaica and discovered that they bear the title ‘Guardians> of the Vatican Treasury’… The appointment of Rothschild gave the Black Papacy> [the hierarchy of the Jesuit Order] absolute financial privacy and secrecy.> Who would ever search a family of orthodox Jews for the key to the wealth of> the Roman Catholic Church? Bill Hughes writes in The Secret Terrorists and The Enemy Unmasked:> The Rothschilds were Jesuits who used their Jewish background as a façade to> cover their sinister activities. The Jesuits, working through Rothschild and> [financier Nicholas] Biddle, sought to gain control of the banking system of> the United States. There are Jesuit plants throughout politics, finance, commerce, media andmilitary. Among them are Bill Clinton, who attended the Jesuit GeorgetownUniversity; Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro; mass murderer Robert Mugabe, Presidentof Zimbabwe; and the horrific Simon Peres, former leader of Israel. Members ofthe Knights of Malta have included Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, former Secretaryof State Alexander Haig, and Prescott Bush Jr., brother of Father George Bush.The Hitler-funding Herbert Walker, grandfather of Father Bush, attended an eliteJesuit school called Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England – ‘a school withmore than 400 years of Jesuit tradition’, as it says on its website. The globalintelligence community is full of agents working for the Church of Rome with theKnights of Malta once again a prime coordinator. During the Second World War,while Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini were being controlled by the Jesuit–Vaticannetwork, so were the intelligence agencies of the United States, Germany and theSoviet Union. Their operatives included William Donovan, head of the CIApredecessor, the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS; General Reinhard Gehlenof German Intelligence, who joined the CIA after the war; and Prince AntonTurkul with Soviet Intelligence. Turkul used Jesuits as couriers. Nazi Generaland war criminal, Reinhard Gehlen, Hitler’s head of intelligence for the EasternFront, was given the highest honour of the Knights of Malta, the ‘Grand Cross ofMerit’, for services rendered. Many heads of the CIA have been Knights of Malta,among them the first director, Allen Dulles, and George Tenet, CIA directorbefore and during 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq. The infamous James JesusAngleton, a major CIA operative involved in the Kennedy assassination, was aKnight of Malta and controlled by the Jesuits. He largely grew up in Rome andbecame the head of both the Israel and Vatican ‘desks’ at the CIA, chief ofcounterintelligence, and its ‘liaison’ with the Warren Commission that coveredup the Kennedy assassination. FBI chief, J. Edgar Hoover, and Clay Shaw, a CIAagent and the only man to be brought to trial for the murder of Kennedy, wereKnights of Malta. So was Kim Philby, the British Intelligence agent turnedSoviet spy, a man close to the Rothschilds and a friend of James Jesus Angleton.The son of Nazi supporter, John Foster Dulles, US Secretary of State after theSecond World War and brother of the CIA Director, Allen Dulles, became a Jesuitpriest and went on to be a cardinal.Image [../Images/00118.jpg]Figure 113: The headquarters of the Skull and Bones Society, a windowlessmausoleum known as ‘the Tomb’, across the street from Yale University Tantrums from the ‘Tomb’Every country has its own secret society network and this connects with theglobal web. In the United States, there is the appropriately-named Skull andBones Society based in a bleak windowless building known as ‘The Tomb’, acrossthe road from the campus of Yale University at New Haven in Connecticut (Figure113). Every year fifteen bloodline students are initiated into this satanic,blood drinking ‘Order’, and the ratio of initiates who end up in positions ofpower in politics, banking, business, media and intelligence agencies in theUnited States is far, far higher than the general student population. PresidentBoy Bush, who was born in New Haven, is a Skull and Bones initiate, code-named‘Temporary’, which might refer to his brain cell activity. Father Bush is also amember, as was his father, Prescott Bush, one of the funders of Adolf Hitler.Prescott Bush is most famous within the Skull and Bones Order for raiding thegrave of the Native American Apache leader, Geronimo. In May 1918, Prescott Bushand five other Skull and Bones men ransacked the grave at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.They took turns to stand guard while others robbed the grave and took awayartefacts and Geronimo’s skull. This was taken to the Skull and Bonesheadquarters at Yale, where it was used in their sick rituals and ceremonies.This horrible story is told in an internal history of the Skull and BonesSociety and was quoted to Ned Anderson, the Tribal Chairman of the San CarlosApache tribe, when he was negotiating to have Geronimo’s remains returned to thetribe’s custody. A 1989 article in The New Yorker said: ‘One Bonesman … recalledduring the early 70s seeing perhaps thirty skulls, not all of them human,scattered about the Tomb’. This is the mentality of the people running ourworld.The Bushes are related to the Tafts, who provided President William Howard Taft,and it was his father, Alphonso Taft, and another Reptilian hybrid bloodline,William Harrison Russell, who established the Skull and Bones Society. Initiatespledge allegiance to the society above all else for the rest of their lives.When they become President of the United States, or enter other positions ofpower, their first allegiance is to the agenda of the secret society, not whatis best for the people or country they are claiming to serve. There are only afew hundred Skull and Bones members alive at any one time, yet, in a country ofsome 300 million people, they managed to produce both candidates, George Bushand John Kerry, at the presidential ‘election’ of 2004. One was supposed to be a‘Republican’ and another a ‘Democrat’, but they are masks on the same face –answerable to the same masters. This is how ‘democracy’ works. When Bush andKerry appeared on the show, Meet the Press, they ducked questions about theirmembership of a secret society to which these would-be presidents had pledgedtotal allegiance. Bush said: ‘It’s so secret we can’t talk about it’. Kerryresponded: ‘There are all kinds of secrets … but one thing is not a secret. Idisagree with this president’s direction that he’s taking the country’. That wasit, no further interrogation to ask how two members of the same secret society,taking the same oath of loyalty, could run for President of the United Stateswhile refusing to discuss the implications. The interviewer knew better than todelve any further because it would have been a fatal career move.In late 2000, Ron Rosenbaum of the New York Observer was in a team usinghigh-tech night vision equipment to record a Skull and Bones initiation ceremonyin the inner courtyard of ‘The Tomb’. They witnessed a robed Bonesman posing asGeorge W. Bush haranguing initiates in an ‘eerily accurate Texas drawl’ saying:‘I’m gonna ream you like I reamed Al Gore’ and ‘I’m gonna kill you like I killedAl Gore’. Rosenbaum reported that the Bush sound-alike appeared a bitdisgruntled with his role and he complained: ‘I got the power to bomb the crapout of China and they give me this station?’ He also said: ‘I’m the President ofthe motha-fuckin’ USA’, sounding more and more like Bush, said Rosenbaum. Otherswere heard to shout ‘Take that plunger out of my ass!’, and initiates hurledsexual insults at each other like ‘lick my bumhole neophyte [new initiate]’ asthey were forced to kneel and kiss a skull at the feet of the initiators. ‘Lickmy ass, neophyte!’ and ‘Do you like my bum, neophyte?’, were also heard.Remember George W. Bush and his father have been through these rituals.Initiates were witnessed by the New York Observer team acting out ‘the tableauof a throat-cutting ritual murder’. One of the Patriarchs of The Order said: ‘Weought to get better blood than this fuckin’ syrup, man’. Rosenbaum writes:> [The initiates] were forced face-to-face with a shocking tableau: a guy> holding what seemed like a butcher’s knife, wearing a kind of animal-skin> ‘barbarian’ look, stood over what seemed to be a woman covered in fake blood> and not much else. The neophyte then approached a skull a few feet away from> the knife-wielder-and-victim tableau. The neophyte knelt and kissed the skull,> at which point the guy with the knife knelt and cut the throat of the prone> figure. [Well, pretended to cut the throat]. The rituals are full of death imagery and the initiates are told they must ‘dieto the barbarian world’ and be reborn in the company of the elect of what theycall ‘The Order’. The ceremony of ‘re-birth’ includes lying naked in a coffin(of course) and revealing all your sexual secrets to your fellow initiates. Onewitness said he had seen a figure dressed like the devil, another in ahooded-skeleton costume and others in robes. The ritual also included the deathmantra: ‘The Hangman equals death! The Devil equals death! Death equals death!’It involved orders for the initiates to fetch bones, including a thigh bone, andthis is just one of the black magic secret societies that provide the personnelthat control global events. As Rosenbaum said:> It’s an initiation ceremony that has bonded diplomats, media moguls, bankers> and spies into a lifelong, multi-generational fellowship far more influential> than any fraternity. It was – and still remains – the heart of the heart of> the American establishment. > But the relationships are first forged by the rituals and the fact that the> founders of Time Inc. and the CIA, as well as several Secretaries of State and> National Security Advisors – the men who made the decision to drop the> Hiroshima bomb, invade the Bay of Pigs and plunge us into Vietnam, the Tafts,> the Bundys, the Buckleys, the Harrimans, the Lovetts – all took part in this> initiation ritual may have something to do with the real world power of those> bonds. The unspoken understanding, the comfort level with the clandestine, the> nods and winks with which power is exercised. All true, but it’s more than that. The way power is exercised is coldly andstrictly controlled by those you never see.Different masks, same faceThe secret society web allows the actions of people in different organisations,positions and countries to be coordinated in the ‘movie’ version of events thatis presented in the mainstream media to mislead the public. Most ‘journalists’don’t know they are presenting a false story because they just tell the peoplewhat those in power tell them. The secret society network operates throughoutthe world, not only in the West. The Middle East is teeming with them and thisallows Western and Arabic initiates of the Reptilian hybrid underground tocoordinate their activities to the common goal. Saddam Hussein, who wasinstalled as dictator in Iraq and supplied with chemical weapons by the CIA andthe US government, was a member of the elite Safari Club. This began as aconsortium involving SAVAK, the CIA-connected secret police of the Shah of Iran;Anwar Sadat, the later-assassinated President of Egypt; and Saudi ArabianIntelligence. It has been implicated in countless coups in Africa to further itsgoals and is heavily involved in arms trading and supply.Out of the Safari Club came the Pinay Circle, or Le Cercle, named after theFrench Prime Minister, Antoine Pinay. He was a major Reptilian hybrid asset whoattended the first official meeting of the Illuminati’s Bilderberg Group atOosterbeek, Holland, in May 1954. This is an organisation I will come to in thenext chapter. Others involved with Le Cercle included the ‘Austrian’ Habsburgfamily, a major Reptilian hybrid bloodline that controlled much of Europe forcenturies. I am convinced that the Rothschild-supported Arnold Schwarzenegger,the Austrian bloodline Governor of California, is an unofficial Habsburg. Itturns out that his family were Nazi supporters. My god, blow me down with a puffof wind. The membership range of Le Cercle will give you an idea of the reach ofthese secret societies. It has included Nicholas Elliot, a department head atBritain’s MI6; William Colby, a former director of the CIA; Colonel Botta ofSwiss Military Intelligence; Stefano Della Chiaie, a leading member of theItalian Secret Service; Giulio Andreotti, Henry Kissinger’s friend, formerItalian Prime Minister from the notorious P-2 Freemasonry lodge; Silva Munoz, aformer minister for the fascist Franco in Spain and a member of Opus Dei; FranzJosef Strauss, the German Defence Minister; and Monsignore Brunello, an agent tothe Vatican. It has been suggested that Le Cercle was behind the murder ofPrincess Diana and it was certainly perfectly placed to both arrange it andcover it up. In America, one of the Le Cercle fronts is alleged to be theCIA-backed Heritage Foundation in Washington. This is how apparently unconnectedpeople and organisations can be coordinated to work to the same end across theworld. This structure has been used by Reptilian hybrid organisations throughouthistory and continues today on a massive scale through global vehicles like theFreemasons.A glimpse in the cesspitFreemasonry is the biggest secret society in the world and has many expressions.The main ones are the Scottish Rite and the York rite, although there are otherelite groupings and offshoots, many of which ‘mainstream’ Freemasons have noidea about. People say ‘it’s the Freemasons’ when most of them are cluelessabout the real agenda being played out around them. It is often claimed thatFreemasonry only began in the 16th and 17th centuries when other professionswere allowed into the guilds and societies of the stonemasons, but Freemasonryis another strand that goes back, in its rituals, goals and ruling bloodlines,to Babylon and the ancient world. As Stewart Swerdlow said:> Babylon was the civilization that Sumer developed into as it expanded into> Central Asia to become the Khazars. In fact, many of the Blueblood> organisations that developed through the millennia called themselves Babylon> Brotherhoods. [They] later combined with the secret Atlantean-Egyptian schools> in Europe to become the Freemasons. There is run-of-the-mill Freemasonry and then there is the inner core that hidesbehind the ignorant majority. A very public example of Illuminati Freemasonrywas the Propaganda Due Lodge in Italy, better known as P-2. There have been rareoccasions when the web controlling those ‘in power’ has come to public attentionand one such case involved P-2 in 1981. The scandal revealed the structurethrough which the few control the many and how the Illuminati network in onecountry connects with others to form the spider’s web I am talking about. The‘strand’ that was P-2 gave us a glimpse of the web itself. The head of P-2 whenexposure came was Licio Gelli, the Mussolini fascist and friend of Father GeorgeBush, Ronald Reagan and Argentine fascist, Juan Peron. Gelli attended thepresidential inauguration of Knight of Malta Ronald Reagan in 1981, and spentthe entire week with Father Bush. Gelli served in a Black Shirts Battalion inthe Spanish civil war and was a liaison officer in Hermann Goering’s SS. He alsoworked for British and Russian intelligence and became an associate ofIlluminati operatives, Henry Kissinger, the Sumerian-Khazar former US Secretaryof State, and Michael Ledeen, one of the predominant ‘Neoconservatives’ or‘Neocons’ behind the Bush administration and the invasions of Afghanistan andIraq. Kissinger, together with Edmond de Rothschild and David Rockefeller, wereprominent in P-2, and for anyone researching the background to the globalconspiracy the names Kissinger, Rockefeller and, especially, Rothschild areconstant companions. Gelli and P-2 also had close links with Mossad, theRothschild-controlled Israeli intelligence arm, as confirmed by former Mossadagent, Victor Ostrovsky, in his 1994 book, The Other Side of Deception.P-2 was founded in 1877, but it was only after Licio Gelli, a Knight of Malta,took over in the 1960s that its power and influence began to soar. He was knownby P-2 initiates as the ‘Naja Hannah’, or ‘King Cobra’, and nothing could bemore apt. P-2 was what they call a ‘covered lodge’ in that it was secret even tomainstream Freemasonry and operated outside its control. As was later proved, itwas structured in the classic compartmentalised pyramid-within-pyramid stylethat I have long described. It was the same as that of the Bavarian Illuminati,which was based on the Jesuits. There were different groups within P-2 and theheads of those groups only knew their own members. They had no idea who was inthe other groups and only Gelli and his closest associates knew that. This meantthat within the government, military, intelligence agencies and media were P-2members who didn’t know that they were all initiates of the same secret society.In turn, Gelli’s level of P-2 connected into the Mafia, as well as other majorFreemasonic lodges around the world like the Grand Alpine Lodge in Switzerland,which was closely associated with Gelli’s friend, Henry Kissinger. A formermember of P-2, Mino Pecorelli, said it was ultimately controlled by the CIA andthe Knights of Malta – therefore the Jesuit Order. Not surprisingly, Pecorelliwas then found dead. Blackmailing politicians and others into compliance wasmade easier when the former head of the Italian Secret Service joined P-2 in1967 and provided 150,000 sensitive dossiers on Italy’s rich and famous.It was the Vatican connection that eventually unravelled P-2, although itrecovered and continues in secret today. One of its most prominent initiates,Roberto Calvi, was chairman of the Banco Ambrosiano, Italy’s biggest privatebank, when it collapsed spectacularly. Banco Ambrosiano (main shareholder, theVatican Bank) had been laundering money for P-2 and other Illuminati operations,among many other illegal activities. Italian investigators uncovered $1.4billion in loans to Latin American front companies through a Luxembourg-basedsubsidiary with close links to the Vatican. Calvi, who became known as ‘God’sBanker’, was arrested in 1981 and jailed for four years, but he was freedpending appeal and headed for Venice and then London, where he apparently triedto negotiate a loan with Opus Dei. After being officially missing for nine days,and 24 hours after his secretary apparently killed herself in Italy, he wasfound hanged under Blackfriars Bridge on the River Thames close to the City ofLondon financial district and the area known as ‘The Temple’ – named after theKnights Templar and its ancient church. Roberto Calvi was hanging from ascaffold with masonry in his pockets and some $15,000 in his wallet. It was anobvious ritual murder, even down to the choice of Blackfriars Bridge.‘Blackfriar’ was a P-2 code. The Blackfriars were the Roman Catholic DominicanOrder, so named because of their black cappa or cloak, which inspired the blackhoods worn by P-2 initiates. Blackfriars Bridge has pulpits in its design inrecognition of the Blackfriars Monastery that once stood nearby. Calvi’s deathwas ‘investigated’ by the Knights Templar/Freemason-controlled City of LondonPolice who predictably decided it was suicide, but pressure from Calvi’s familyand information from ‘Mafia Supergrasses’ led to the case being reopened. Hisbody was exhumed and forensic tests confirmed that he was murdered. Five peoplewere charged for his murder, but they were acquitted by a Rome court in 2007because there was ‘insufficient proof’. The people who ultimately ordered hisdeath will not be officially identified and even the actual killers won’t knowwho they were. The Italian publication, Panorama, reported that one of theRothschild clan, Ellie de Rothschild, financed the murder to ensure Calvi’ssilence. The Rothschilds were made the ‘Guardians of the Vatican Treasury’ andcontrol the Vatican finances.It was the Calvi–Vatican Bank fraud that led to investigations into the P-2connection and when Licio Gelli’s villa was searched in 1981 police found amembership list that included 953 high-level officials. They included judges,bankers, heads of police, members of government and other politicians, alongwith generals and religious leaders connected to the Vatican secret society,Opus Dei, which connects with the Jesuit Order. The police also found membershiplists for the Knights Templar because these secret societies fuse together atthe highest level, as I have long been pointing out. There were many SouthAmerican members, too. An Italian parliamentary commission said that Gelli andP-2 were operating as ‘a state within the Italian state’. That is exactly whatthey were doing and it is still happening today in countries across the world.The ‘revelation’ in 2006 by journalist Bob Woodward that Bush was being‘advised’ on foreign policy and Iraq by Henry Kissinger made perfect sense onceyou know how it all fits together. Kissinger represents the Illuminati and theRothschilds, and he delivers their orders to Bush or whoever is president. Itwas the P-2 and its connected secret societies that were behind the terroristgroup known as the Red Brigades, which murdered both a judge investigatingCalvi’s bank and the prominent Italian politician, Aldo Moro, after he had beenthreatened with ‘consequences’ by Kissinger via US government officials. Moro’swife said that he was told by Kissinger: ‘You must abandon your policy ofbringing all the political forces in your country into direct collaboration.Either you give this up or you will pay dearly for it’. The Red Brigades werealso accused of the Bologna railway station bombing that killed 85 and injured200 in 1980. This was no surprise given the way that major terrorist outragestoday like 9/11 are engineered by the same Reptilian hybrid Illuminati networks.The golden rule when you are in danger of exposure is to hold an ‘independentinquiry’. This allows you avoid difficult questions by saying you don’t wish to‘pre-judge the outcome of the inquiry’ when all along you know what it’s goingto be because you picked the ‘inquiry’s’ personnel. Tony Blair did this is intext-book fashion when he established the ‘inquiry’ by Lord Hutton into thecircumstances surrounding the blatant murder of weapons inspector, David Kelly,who had said, accurately as it turned out, that Blair’s claims about the dangersfrom Saddam Hussein had been ‘sexed up’. The Vatican did the same in the wake ofthe P-2/Calvi scandal. Among those appointed to the ‘independent’ inquiry was DrHerman Abs, the war-time head of Deutsche Bank and one of Hitler’s prime sourcesof funding. He was known as ‘Hitler’s Paymaster’. Abs, a Knight of Malta, wasalso on the board of I.G. Farben, the Nazi pharmaceutical giant that usedconcentration camp prisoners as slave labour. He was arrested after the war, butthe Rothschild-controlled Bank of England intervened to free him. Abs and theRoman Catholic Church were made for each other.Licio Gelli and P-2 had close connections to another Illuminati strand known as‘Gladio’, which consisted largely of former Nazis who were protected fromprosecution and execution after the war by, among others, British and AmericanIntelligence and the Vatican. Gladio was established in 1956 by British andAmerican intelligence and especially CIA chief Allen Dulles. ‘Gladio’ was namedafter a short sword used by Roman legionaires and another of its code names was‘Stay Behind’, because many of its agents were ‘stay behinds’ who did not returnto their own countries after the war. Gladio emerged from the Stay Behindnetwork, recruiting 15,000 agents and operating in countries all over Europe,not least Italy. It was Gelli who coordinated the contributions of P-2 andGladio to the Red Brigades terrorists, the murders of Aldo Moro and RobertoCalvi, and other outrages that terrorised Italian society. When Moro was told byUS officials that if he didn’t do as he was told the ‘groups on the fringes ofthe official secret services might be brought into operation’, they were talkingabout P-2 and Gladio. All this happened with the support and funding of HenryKissinger, then US National Security Advisor, and Knight of Malta AlexanderHaig, the former NATO Supreme Commander and future US Secretary of State underReagan–Bush. In the shadows, as always, were the Rothschilds.The murdered PopeP-2 was also behind the murder in 1978 of Pope John Paul I after thirty-threedays in office. The number thirty-three is of great esoteric/Matrix significanceto the network, hence the thirty-three degrees of the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry, and it comes up again and again. Pope John Paul I, birth-nameAlbino Luciani, had begun to see the influence of P-2 within the Church andwanted it stopped. David Yallop tells the story in his excellent book, In God’sName. The Pope was initiating changes that appalled the controlling cabal of thesatanic ‘inner-Vatican’, and he handed a list of decisions to one of thesepeople, the Vatican secretary of state Cardinal Jean Villot, to be implementedthe following day. It included appointments, resignations and transfers, andalthough Villot argued against them, it was to no avail. Yallop writes:> There was one common denominator, one fact that linked each of the men about> to be replaced. Villot was aware of it. More important, so was the Pope. It> had been one of the factors that had caused him to act, to strip these men of> real power ... it was Freemasonry. > The evidence the Pope had acquired indicated that within the Vatican City> State there were over one hundred Masons, ranging from cardinals to priests.> Luciani was further preoccupied with an illegal Masonic lodge that had> penetrated far beyond Italy in its search for wealth and power. It called> itself P-2. The fact that it had penetrated the Vatican walls and formed links> with priests, bishops, and even cardinals made P-2 anathema to Albino Luciani. > That evening, September 28, 1978, thirty-three days after his election, Pope> John Paul I, ‘the smiling Pope’, was declared dead. No official death> certificate has ever been issued. No autopsy ever performed. His body was> hastily embalmed. Cause of death: Unknown. And Vatican business continues ...> The facts are here in meticulous detail, documenting widespread corruption> within the Vatican and presenting a compelling case that six powerful men, to> protect their vast financial and political operations, decided on a shocking> course of action – Pope John Paul I must die. Within the P-2 story we have a glimpse of how the Reptilian hybrids controlglobal events. When someone joins a secret society they pledge their loyalty tothat cause above all else, and they give an oath to never reveal the secrets.Many of these people are placed in leading roles in politics, finance, media,and so on, or recruited because they are already in an influential position.Even as a president or prime minister their first loyalty is pledged to theirsecret order, and not to the population they claim to serve and represent.People have no idea what the rich and famous get up to away from the sound-biteinterviews and pompous decrees on the television news channels, but if you areprepared to dig you can unearth some of the inner workings of the Hidden Hand inthe white glove. Two former initiates of P-2 told of their experience in theinitiation rituals performed by these strange people in the presence of the‘Naja Hannah’ or ‘King Cobra’, Licio Gelli. They were taken to a compound, avilla hidden in the Apennines in the region of Tuscany, a favourite holidayvenue for Tony Blair. The property was surrounded by a 12-foot wall and in thecentre of the courtyard was a cobra-like sculpture, with its inflated hood,twice the size of a human skull. Its single eye was a closed-circuit camera thatfollowed all visitors, welcome or not. It was controlled from a room inside thevilla where eight monitors, each with five stations, cover eight guest rooms,patio, pool, dining room, sitting room, and party room. On the walls inside wereportraits of Mussolini, Hitler, and Peron. The former P-2 initiates describedhow visiting the place was akin to ‘breathing the odor of danger and power thatpenetrates the soul and cell by cell contaminates the mind with fear’. Theaccount went on:> ... In the meeting room, twelve members of P-2, dressed in satin ceremonial> robes and wearing black hoods reminiscent of those worn by members of the Ku> Klux Klan, sit in leather chairs at a red marble conference table. They are> the elite members of the Wolf Pack, Gelli’s disciples … None of the black-clad> disciples knows the identity of any of his eleven brothers. Grand Master Licio> Gelli is the only one who bares his face. > Two Masons stand post at the entrance to the meeting room. Their faces are> also covered. They are Naja Hannah’s [King Cobra’s] personal bodyguards, some> say his death squad – former Mussolini Fascists whose job is to protect the> Grand Master and kill any of the twelve disciples who betray the cause – ‘Il> Momento di Passare all’ (The Time for Real Action). Like Naja Hannah and his> disciples, each bodyguard carries an axe; they also bear automatic weapons. > The ceremony begins. There is an uneven series of knocks at the door. ‘Your> Worshipful’, a disciple announces, ‘a Pagan wishes to enter’. The Grand Master> strikes the table with one blow with his axe. Immediately the oversized door> swings open and slams against the inner wall. Two guards escort the initiate> to the centre of the room where he faces the twelve Masons with his back to> the Grand Master’s throne. The Pagan, as he is called, is wearing a plain> black hood and a blindfold. > ‘His identity is known to Grand Master Licio Gelli but to no one else. He is> asked one question by each of the disciples, but the Pagan does not answer.> Instead, one of the guards speaks for him. Once all the ritual questions about> purpose and belief and reason for wanting to become a member of Propaganda Due> are answered, the Pagan is turned to face the Grand Master, who asks, ‘Pagan,> are you prepared to die in order to preserve the secrets of Propaganda Due’ > The initiate now answers for himself: ‘I am’. > ’Do you have the necessary quality of contempt for danger?’ > ‘I do’. > ‘Do you have the necessary quality of courage?’ > ’I am courageous.’ > ‘Do you proclaim yourself an Anti-Communist?’ > ‘I do’. > ‘And Pagan, are you prepared to fight and perhaps face shame, even death, so> that we who may become your Brothers may destroy this Government and form a> Presidency?’ > ‘I am’. That description encapsulates how the hidden network of the Reptilian hybridsoperates throughout the world. It recruits those it believes can benefit itsagenda; it rules them with fear of terrifying consequences if they refuse to dowhat is demanded of them, or if they reveal any secrets; and itcompartmentalises everyone so only the few right at the top know who is who andwhat is really going on. When the P-2 membership list was seized in 1981, amongthe names was Silvio Berlesconi, the Illuminati operative and close friend ofTony Blair. Berlesconi has a massive depiction in his garden of a reptile eatinga human (Figures 114 and 115), the same image that Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa haspainted on his ceremonial hut in keeping with the legends of the Chitauri(Figure 116). By serving his masters, Berlesconi went on to become PrimeMinister of Italy, a media baron and one of the richest men on the planet. He isincredibly corrupt, but then that’s what the Illuminati are looking for. Theywant agents for the cause who have no conscience, no sense of right or justice,and, preferably, with enormous amounts of dirt waiting to be made public if thepuppet seeks to snap his strings. Berlesconi owns Fininvest, Italy’s secondbiggest corporation behind Fiat, and, crucially, Fininvest owns three majortelevision channels that account for half the Italian TV market. Quite an assetif you’re a politician and a front man for the agenda, but when you serve theIlluminati as slavishly as he has the rewards are bound to follow. Berlesconi isan excellent example of how political leaders across the world are chosen longbefore they come to office, but if it suits their masters they can just asquickly be dumped on the scrap heap.Image [../Images/00119.jpg]Figure 114: The reptile-eating-a-human logo of the car maker, Alfa Romeo, andwith the Knights Templar red cross Image [../Images/00120.jpg]Figure 115: The image can also be found in the garden of P2 member, SilvioBerlusconi Image [../Images/00121.jpg]Figure 116: Credo Mutwa has painted the same theme to reflect ancient Africanlegends about the ‘Chitauri’, the ‘Children of the Serpent’ Image [../Images/00122.jpg]Figure 117: The leaders in different countries may appear to be from different‘races’ with an allegiance to their ‘nation’; but they are mostly Reptilianhybrids possessed by Reptilian entities working to the same goal of globaldomination. There is disagreement between them over power and detail, but theyare united by the same overall agenda In summary, the Reptilian hybrids and their other-dimensional masters havecreated a global satanic ‘cult’ of interconnecting secret societies and groupsthat operate in every country and answer to a central command. In this way, theycoordinate action between different countries, religions, races, politicalparties and corporations, through their Reptilian hybrid agents and place people(Figure 117). Former CIA operative Victor Marchetti experienced this himself andtried to expose it in his 1973 book, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, whichwas heavily censored by the agency. But, he did manage to say:> There exists in our world today a powerful and dangerous secret cult. This> cult is patronized and protected by the highest level government officials in> the world. Its membership is composed of those in the power centers of> government, industry, commerce, finance, and labor. It manipulates individuals> in areas of important public influence – including the academic world and the> mass media. The Secret Cult is a global fraternity of a political aristocracy> whose purpose is to further the political policies of persons or agencies> unknown. It acts covertly and illegally. And it wants to control the world."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 8 The Round Table nexus > The best weapon of a dictatorship is secrecy, but the best weapon of a> democracy should be the weapon of openness. > Niels Bohr Further out from the spider is a network of organisations which answers to theRound Table secret society that I mentioned earlier. The Round Table was themanipulating force behind the Balfour Declaration about a Jewish homeland inIsrael, and has been involved in so many other world-changing events, includingthe two global wars, the Versailles ‘Peace’ Conference and the creation of theLeague of Nations, United Nations and European Union.Image [../Images/00123.jpg]Figure 118: The Round Table network The Round Table network operates as the bridge between the inner and outerlevels of the Illuminati structure. Most of its associated organisations evenpresent a public face and, once again, the majority of their members will have alimited understanding of what is really going on. The Round Table groups includethe Royal Institute of International Affairs (UK), the Bilderberg Group (mainlyEurope/USA), the Council on Foreign Relations (USA), the Trilateral Commission(USA-Europe-worldwide), and a number of others, including the Club of Rome,which operates globally (Figure 118). Their cover story is to claim they aremerely ‘think tanks’ that allow leading figures in politics, business, banking,military, royalty and media to meet and discuss world affairs. In fact, they arevehicles for coordinating the Reptilian hybrid plan for a world government,world central bank, world army, world currency and a microchipped populationlinked to a global computer. The Round Table network, with others in theIlluminati web, established the League of Nations, United Nations, EuropeanUnion, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organisation to furtheradvance what is called ‘globalisation’ – world dictatorship under another name.Carroll Quigley, a professor at the Jesuit-controlled Georgetown University, wasan ‘insider’ who was given access to secret papers on the Round Tableconspiracy. Quigley, who taught Bill Clinton at Georgetown, broke ranks andrevealed in great detail what was happening behind the scenes in the first fiftyyears of the 20th century. He said the Round Table dictated British policy inIreland, Palestine and India from 1917 to 1945 and controlled to an overwhelmingextent ‘the sources and writing of the history of British imperial and foreignpolicy since the Boer War’, which started in 1880. The rewriting of history is avital part of the Reptilian hybrid strategy because the way we perceive historyfundamentally affects the way we see the world and each other today. Quigleysaid this about the Round Table, or the ‘Milner group’ as he calls it, in hisbook, The Anglo-American Establishment:> The picture is terrifying because such power, whatever the goals at which it> may be directed, is too much to be entrusted safely to any group … No country> that values its safety should allow what the Milner group accomplished – that> is, that a small number of men would be able to wield such power in> administration and politics, should be given almost complete control over the> publication of documents relating to their actions, should be able to exercise> such influence over the avenues of information that create public opinion, and> should be able to monopolise so completely the writing and teaching of the> history of their own period. It is equally sobering to think that even though the Round Table was directingthe policies of the then most powerful country and empire in the world, thepeople didn’t know such an organisation existed, never mind what it was doing.The official architect of the Round Table in the late 19th century was CecilJohn Rhodes. He was a Rothschild agent who devastated southern Africa with warand poverty and turned the region into a slave state under British Empire(Rothschild) control. He also set out to destroy the carriers of the ancientknowledge, to ‘milk the minds of the shamans and then kill them’, as Credo Mutwaputs it. In its place, Rhodes and his fellow Reptilian hybrids then imposed thetyranny of ‘Christianity’, the literal version of their Babylonian religion, onthe native people. It still controls enormous numbers of them to this day.Rhodes exploited the diamond and gold resources of South Africa at enormous costfor the indigenous people and founded the diamond giant, De Beers, for theRothschilds. His mental state was captured when he looked at the night sky andsaid: ‘All of these stars ... these vast worlds that remain out of reach. If Icould, I would annex other planets’. This is archetypal Reptilian. Theircomputer program is based on the desire to control everyone and everything. Thememorial to Rhodes at Cape Town, South Africa, is dominated by the Illuminatisymbol of the lion and is located on the slopes of a place called Devil’s Peak.Isn’t synchronicity wonderful?Rhodes and others agreed to form the secret society that became the Round Tableat a meeting in 1891. Among them was Lord Esher, a friend, confidant and advisorto Queen Victoria, King Edward VII and King George V. The group consisted, likeall similar organisations, of at least two levels. One was the inner circle, the‘Society of the Elect’ (in the know), and the outer circle was called the‘Association of Helpers’ (not in anything like the same know). This is thefamiliar technique of using a group of largely innocent people to hide anddefend, through lack of knowledge, the organisation they think they understand,but don’t. Rhodes left a series of wills when he died in 1902 to fund thecreation of a secret society, based yet again on the Jesuit Order, to put theworld under British rule. The wills also funded Rhodes Scholarships throughwhich carefully selected men, and later women, would be sent to OxfordUniversity to be indoctrinated with the ‘philosophy’ of ‘British’ (Illuminati)domination. Bill Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar and remember how one of themethods of Adam Weishaupt’s Bavarian Illuminati was to give scholarships tothose ‘scouted’ by the Illuminati as potential agents of the future. TheRothschild banker, Alfred Milner, took over as leader of the Rhodes group and,in time, it became known as the Round Table. It created an offshoot in theUnited States with leading members of the American Reptilian hybrid bloodlines.It was in the US that the power blocs that would control political and economicpolicy, and the communications industry, were being assembled in the early yearsof the 20th century. These were the organisations and the businesses of the‘Eastern Establishment’, which work in concert with British and European RoundTable members to a common global policy. The Round Table network expanded toinclude London’s Royal Institute of International Affairs, or ‘Chatham House’(1920); Council on Foreign Relations (1921); Bilderberg Group (1954); TrilateralCommission (1973); and so on. These groups involve leading names in politics,media, business, banking and military who can be coordinated in their thinkingand actions by the central core, the Round Table. Most of the members don’trealise how they are being moulded to support the plan.The Bilderberg GroupThe creation of the Bilderberg Group and the European Union are linked by oneman in particular, the Polish ‘socialist’ Joseph Retinger, a founder of theEuropean Movement. It was Retinger and the Reptilian Prince Bernhard of theNetherlands who suggested regular meetings of European foreign ministers. Out ofthese meetings came the customs union known as the Benelux Countries (Belgium,Netherlands, and Luxemburg), a forerunner to the European Union, which I willdiscuss in more detail in a later chapter. Appropriately, it was in a speech atChatham House to the Royal Institute of International Affairs that Retinger setout his vision of a Europe in which countries would ‘relinquish part of theirsovereignty’. He should have said all of it because that’s the idea. In London,he met Averell Harriman, the US Ambassador to England, a master manipulator andinitiate of the Skull and Bones Society. He came from the same Harriman familyso closely connected to the Bush clan and, as well as funding Hitler, they wereone of the most prominent forces behind the eugenics or ‘master race’ movement.Averell Harriman arranged for Retinger to visit the United States where, in hisown words, he enjoyed widespread approval for his plans from Russel C.Leffingwell, senior partner in the J.P. Morgan (Rothschild) bank and official ofthe Council on Foreign Relations (CFR); David Rockefeller, CFR chairman from1946 to 1953; Nelson Rockefeller (CFR); and Sir William Wiseman, partner in theRothschild bank, Kuhn, Loeb and company, headed by Jacob Schiff. It was Schiffwho funded the Russian Revolution, created the US Federal Reserve withRothschild agent, Paul Warburg, and established the Anti-Defamation League.Other American supporters of Retinger’s plans included George Franklin, theCouncil on Foreign Relations executive director from 1953 to 1971 and an ‘inlaw’ to the Rockefeller family, and John Foster Dulles, the US Secretary ofState after the Second World War when his brother, Allen Dulles, was the firstcivilian head of the CIA. The Dulles brothers, like the Rockefellers, Harrimansand Bushes, had been keen supporters of Hitler. Retinger formed the AmericanCommittee on a United Europe with Allen Dulles and William Donovan, the Knightof Malta head of the CIA’s predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services, orOSS. From these and other discussions, came a grouping of leading politicians,political advisors, media owners and executives, multinational company andbanking executives, military leaders and educationalists, who would meet todecide global political and economic policy. It would become known as theBilderberg Group, named after the Bilderberg Hotel at Oosterbeek in theNetherlands, where the first meeting took place between May 29th and 31st, 1954.At the heart of the Bilderberg Group’s formation were the Rothschilds and peoplelike Retinger, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Paul Rykens (chairman of thesoap and food giant, Unilever), and Averell Harriman.Prince Bernhard, a close of friend of fellow Reptilian hybrid, Prince Philip,was a former Nazi SS officer and spy who worked for the chemical giant, I.G.Farben, one of the pillars of the Nazi regime that ran the concentration camp atAuschwitz. Bernhard was born in 1911 as the German Prince of Lupp-Biesterfeld,and married Princess Juliana of the Netherlands in 1937. The man who persuadedBernhard to front the Bilderbergers was the arch manipulator Lord VictorRothschild. Bernhard remained chairman of the Bilderberg Group from 1954 untilhe resigned in 1976 after being implicated in the Lockheed bribery scandal, butDutch royalty have continued to attend every meeting. Other Bilderberg chairmenhave included Sir Alec Douglas Home, or Lord Home, the former British PrimeMinister who was Foreign Secretary to Bilderberger Ted Heath when they signedBritain into what became the European Union. One of the most significantchairmen has been Lord Carrington, the British Foreign Secretary to MargaretThatcher, Secretary General of NATO, and President of the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. Peter Rupert Carrington, a Knight of St John of Jerusalem(the protestant Knights of Malta), came from a banking family that was close tothe Rothschilds. In his book, The English Rothschilds, Richard Davis reportsthat Lionel Rothschild was a frequent visitor to the Carrington’s home inWhitehall. The two families are related by the marriage in 1878 between thefifth Earl Rosebery and Hannah Rothschild, daughter of Baron Mayer deRothschild. Carrington was on the board of Hambros Bank which has been linkedwith the P-2 scandal in Italy. The current Bilderberg chairman is the Belgian,Viscount Étienne Davignon, former Vice-President of the European Commission.David Rockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan Bank, has been among the mostprominent figures behind the Bilderbergers and the Round Table network in thelast four decades, along with manipulator-in-chief, Henry Kissinger. They havebeen the movers while the Rothschilds are the shakers in the background.Kissinger and Rockefeller still attend every Bilderberg meeting, but theemphasis is shifting to others as the agenda moves on. The Neoconservativesbehind the Bush Administration and the ‘war on terror’ have become moreinfluential, people like Richard Pearle, Michael Ledeen and former US DeputySecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who replaced the Bilderberger andRothschild partner, James Wolfensohn, as head of the World Bank in 2005. He waslater forced to resign in a financial scandal. Wolfowitz was replaced as WorldBank chief by fellow Khazar/Sumerian, Robert Zoellick, another Bilderbergattendee. Major global posts, such as President of the World Bank, head of theWorld Trade Organisation, Secretary General of NATO, as well as major political,business and banking positions, are invariably held by Bilderbergers or membersof other groups in the Round Table network.The Bilderberg cabal meets in strict secrecy once a year, usually in May, atsome exclusive location in Europe or North America, but its Steering Committeemeets regularly and this is where the real power lies. Bilderberg meetings bringtogether current and potential manipulators and puppets to discuss matters thatthe Illuminati want to influence or pursue. What follows are policy changeswithin the major governments and agencies in line with the discussions ordecisions made at Bilderberg conferences. Global business and banking leadersrub shoulders, and scratch backs, with royalty, politicians, military chiefs andmedia owners and controllers. Leaders of other groups in the Round Table nexus,including Richard N. Haas, President of the Council on Foreign Relations andformer Director of Policy and Planning staff at the US State Department, alsoattend. It is the political version of the Reptile House. All of them agree,even the ‘journalists’ who attend, not to divulge what was discussed.Bilderbergers and members of other Round Table organisations invariably turn upin the major positions of power. Rhodes Scholar Bill Clinton attended theBilderberg meeting in 1991 and became US President the following year. He isalso a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.Tony Blair was invited in 1993 and, thanks to the sudden and convenient death ofJohn Smith a year later, he became leader of the Labour Party and Prime Ministerfor a decade. Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell are all attendees ofthe Bilderberg Group and so is Hillary Clinton. You can find the names of theBilderberg attendees, and those of associated groups, in the secret societyarchive at www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com].The kingmakersThe Bilderberg Group also has inner and outer circles of knowledge in the mouldof their master blueprint, the Round Table. The inner circle knows, at least toa larger extent, what the agenda really is – the centralisation of global powerin the hands of the few. Others who are invited here and there remain ‘outer’members with a limited understanding of the game. The ‘outers’ are manipulatedand flattered into supporting an agenda they don’t even know exists. They aresold a policy idea without realising how this fits with hundreds of others tocreate a picture these political babes-in-arms can’t see. But, because they wereinvited to the prestigious Bilderberg Group, they think themselves important andintelligent – and they are encouraged to do so. Blair’s buffoon of a number two,John Prescott, was invited to attend and I’m sure he had no problem believing itwas due to his immense importance and razer-sharp intellect. He would not havebeen an ‘inner’, it is safe to say. The same can be said of Bilderberg attendee,Margaret Thatcher, who was installed as British Prime Minister in 1979 and thenremoved by Bilderberger intervention when her distaste for the furthercentralisation of the European Union was getting in the way of the agenda.Thatcher was manipulated into power because her economic beliefs suited theIlluminati in the 1980s when they wanted to give away state-owned industries andassets to private (their) interests. The Rothschilds were at the forefront ofthese ‘privatisation’ policies worldwide and they had many ‘friends’ ingovernment to help them. One of Margaret Thatcher’s closest allies in theprivatisation of state assets, her head of the civil service and cabinetsecretary, Lord Armstrong, later became a director of N.M. Rothschild. It was nocoincidence whatsoever that the economics that became known as ‘Thatcherism’ inthe UK was exactly the same as Ronald Reagan’s ‘Reaganomics’ in the same period.Both ‘leaders’ were Illuminati stooges. Reagan was controlled by Vice-PresidentFather George Bush and Thatcher was manipulated by Bilderbergers, especially herForeign Secretary, the Reptilian hybrid Lord Carrington, who would later be along-time chairman of the Bilderberg Group.Once Margaret Thatcher began to challenge the further centralisation of theEuropean Union, a large boot and her backside made perfect contact. In May 1989,the American journalist, Jim Tucker, who has done more than anyone to expose andinfiltrate Bilderberg meetings, reported in the Washington-based Spotlightnewspaper that the meeting that same month on Spain’s La Toja Island had decidedthat Margaret Thatcher had to go in the light of her opposition to thecentralisation of Europe. It seemed crazy at the time that the ‘Iron Lady’, withher apparently impregnable position in both Britain and her own ConservativeParty, could be ousted without a vote from the people. But it happened.‘Impregnable positions’ are illusions and in the gift of those who reallycontrol events. Through 1990 and early the following year, Margaret Thatcher’spower withered away with the overwhelmingly supportive media now turning againsther. By November 1990, she had been challenged for the leadership of her ownparty and after losing the first ballot she resigned. The most significantcontribution to her downfall came from her former Deputy Prime Minister, SirGeoffrey Howe, another Bilderberger. The Reptilian hybrids love irony andsymbolism and Thatcher was forced to announce her decision to resign whileattending a heads of government meeting of the European Union – the oppositionto which had caused her downfall. This is how political and other world eventsare manipulated to suit the Reptilian hybrid agenda. It happens all over theworld every day to introduce or change policies and put the reigns of power inthe hands of Illuminati-controlled politicians and administrators. Anotherexample is the mass killer and Jesuit, Robert Mugabe, who seized power inSouthern Rhodesia when it became Zimbabwe in 1979. He was the puppet of HenryKissinger and Lord Carrington, the British Foreign Secretary responsible forRhodesian ‘independence’. Kissinger and Carrington were not only extremelyprominent Bilderbergers, but also business partners. Carrington was a foundingdirector of the notorious front for global manipulation called KissingerAssociates, and they worked together to install Mugabe as, in effect, thedictator of Zimbabwe. At the time of writing he is still there and he has turnedan abundant country into a starving, fascist wasteland while he has become megarich at the peoples’ expense. It is a familiar tale of the Reptilian hybrids andMugabe is most certainly one of the ‘Children of the Serpent’ that Credo Mutwatalks about in Africa.Royal Institute of International AffairsThe London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), also known asChatham House, has its own network around the world and it provided theblueprint for the Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission in theUnited States. They all present themselves as ‘think tanks’, talking shops andvehicles for ‘debate’. What they really do is manipulate people, policy andevents in line with the goal of world domination and control. The Round Tableelite met at the Versailles Peace Conference in Paris in 1919 and agreed to formthe RIIA the following year. Today, the Royal Institute, with the Queen as itspatron, has an enormous effect on British and global policy, although it wouldprobably laugh at the very suggestion. All these organisations have a ‘Who, me?’response to such statements. The Institute is highly secretive and will notrelease details of its membership in high places. When I rang in the 1990s toask for a list of members in the British Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet, I was toldby the membership secretary that the names of individual members are neverreleased. To join, you have to be nominated by two members who know you well andeven then you might not pass the selection procedure. This is, of course, howthe Freemasons do it, too. The Institute is funded by major global companies andbanks and has received taxpayer funding from the British Foreign andCommonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence, Cabinet Office, Treasury,Department of the Environment, the Department of Trade and Industry, Customs andExcise and the United States Embassy. It is used as a private forum for theelite to sell their globalist agenda to invited audiences and those withinfluence in the media, politics, education and commerce. It is both a lobbyingorganisation, and a means outside the official government machine, through whichdeals can be done and events arranged without the knowledge of either public orelected parliaments. It is more than that, however. It is a powerful pivot inthe secret government network, with very close links to the British Royal Familyand British Intelligence. Again, most of the people involved with the RIIA donot realise how it is being used.Council on Foreign RelationsSince the formation of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921, nearly everyPresident of the United States has been a member and every government ofwhatever party is packed with members of the CFR and its blood-brother, theTrilateral Commission, which was launched in 1973. Their membership extends notonly throughout government, but to banks and corporations, media, intelligenceagencies like the CIA, and the military. It was the Council on ForeignRelations, in coordination with the Round Table network, which created theUnited Nations, the Reptilian Trojan Horse for world government. They had triedbefore with the League of Nations after the First World War, but it hadn’tworked for them. So, they gave the people another war to make the unwillingsurrender to their demands. By 1945, the world was understandably sick and tiredof war and the public mind was open to anything that might prevent more humanslaughter – as planned. The UN Charter was officially accepted byrepresentatives of fifty countries at a meeting in San Francisco on June 26th,1945, but that was only the public culmination of years of behind-the-scenesmanoeuvring by the Council on Foreign Relations, which controlled theadministration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The writer, James Perloff,revealed the background to the UN in his 1988 book, The Shadows Of Power: TheCouncil On Foreign Relations And The American Decline:> In January 1943, the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, formed a steering> committee composed of himself, Leo Pasvolsky, Isaiah Bowman, Sumner Welles,> Norman Davis, and Morton Taylor. All these men – with the exception of Hull –> were in the CFR. Later known as the Informal Agenda Group, they drafted the> original proposal for the United Nations. It was Bowman – a founder of the CFR> … who first put forward the concept. They called in three attorneys, all CFR> men, who ruled that it was constitutional. Then they discussed it with> Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 15th, 1944. The President approved the plan, and> announced it to the public the same day. The US delegation at the founding meeting of the UN in San Francisco was like aroll call of the CFR. It included Isaiah Bowman, Hamilton Fish Armstrong, SumnerWelles, Norman H. Davis, James T. Shotwell, and Russian-born Leo Pasvolsky. Theywere all CFR members who served during the war on Roosevelt’s Advisory Committeeon Post- War Foreign Policies. The US delegation also included: John J. McCloy(CFR chairman from 1953-70, chairman of the Illuminati Ford Foundation and theRockefellers’ Chase Manhattan Bank, and friend and advisor to nine presidentsfrom Roosevelt to Reagan); John Foster Dulles (Hitler supporter, CFR founder andsoon to be Secretary of State); and Nelson Rockefeller (arch manipulator, fourtimes Governor of New York, and Vice- President to President Gerald Ford afterKissinger engineered the Watergate scandal to remove Richard Nixon). In all, 74CFR members were in the delegation and this was the vehicle through which theUnited Nations was manipulated into being. John J. McCloy typified themanipulators who created the UN. He was a financial advisor to the Italianfascist government of Benito Mussolini and he played a significant role in NaziGermany for the Harriman/Bush bank which was financing Hitler. McCloy sat inHitler’s private box at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin at the invitation of RudolfHess and Hermann Göring. McCloy was also a member of the Bilderberg GroupSteering Committee. These are the sort of people behind the Council on ForeignRelations, which directs the United States policy, whatever ‘party’ isofficially in power. As John J. McCloy once said: ‘Whenever we needed a man [fora government position], we thumbed through the roll of the council members andput through a call to New York [The CFR headquarters at Harold Pratt House, 58East 68th Street]’. The granddaughter of former President Theodore Roosevelt,the newspaper columnist Edith Kermit Roosevelt, summed up the grip of theso-called ‘Eastern Establishment’ working through the CFR:> What is the Establishment’s view-point? Through the Roosevelt, Truman,> Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations its ideology is constant: that the best> way to fight Communism is by a One World Socialist State governed by ‘experts’> like themselves. The result has been policies which favour the growth of the> superstate, gradual surrender of United States sovereignty … That’s precisely what the game plan has been all along, but the claim that itwas done to ‘fight communism’ is nonsense. To the Reptilian hybrids in poweraround the world there are no countries or states. These are just units ofmanipulation and their bloodlines in Russia are working to the same end as thosein the United States, Britain and elsewhere. Yes, they fight among themselvesbecause they are power crazy, but their ruling elite bang their heads togetherif this starts to threaten the outcome. Putin in Russia and Bush or HillaryClinton in the United States are different expressions of the same bloodline andthe official interactions between these ‘world leaders’ are just a scene in amovie purely for public consumption. Russia and China are Reptilian hybridfiefdoms, just like Europe or the United States. This is one explanation for why‘Americans’ would fund the Russian Revolution that brought the ‘communists’ topower and the Nazis that brought the ‘fascists’ to power. Terms like ‘communism’and ‘fascism’ are once again two wings on the same plane – controlled by thesame people. The secretary general of the founding UN conference in SanFrancisco was State Department official and CFR member, Alger Hiss, who waslater exposed as a secret agent employed by the Soviet Union. Hiss was executivesecretary of the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conference, where he worked with Stalin’sman, Vyacheslav Molotov, on the details of the UN Charter. He was described asPresident Roosevelt’s ‘top international organisation specialist’ at the YaltaConference in the Crimea in February 1945, which was also attended by Churchilland Stalin. After guiding the UN into existence, Hiss was made president of theIlluminati’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an appointment made bythe CFR’s John Foster Dulles, who ignored information about Hiss’s espionagewhen he was told in 1946. Later Hiss was exposed and spent forty-four months inprison, but such people are not really ‘Soviet’ agents or ‘American’ agents;they are Illuminati agents.Trilateral CommissionThe latest major addition to the Round Table circuitry was the TrilateralCommission, created by David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1973, withcontributions from the Brookings Institution (another ‘think tank’) and theCouncil on Foreign Relations. At first, it was restricted to the United States,Europe and Japan, but now operates worldwide. The Polish-born Brzezinski,President Carter’s National Security Advisor in the 1970s, is still on itsexecutive committee and his books and public statements have confirmed itsambitions and methods of achieving them. He wrote a book called Between TwoAges: America’s Role In The Technetronic Era, in which he described a newsociety ‘… that is shaped culturally, psychologically, socially, andeconomically by the impact of technology and electronics – particularly in thearea of computers and communication’. He said that ‘national sovereignty is nolonger a viable concept’ and suggested the movement, in stages, ‘toward a largercommunity of the developed nations [world government] … through a variety ofindirect ties and already developing limitations on national sovereignty’. In1990, he wrote in The New York Times that Europe should follow a policy ‘foundedupon the grand concept of a trans-European commonwealth with the EuropeanCommunity at its core, but embracing Central Europe and being open also toeventual association with the Soviet Union’. While he was National SecurityAdvisor in the Carter administration, Brzezinski pursued the policy ofsupporting the mujaheddin fighters in Pakistan and Afghanistan in theirguerrilla war against Soviet occupation that began in 1979. The mujaheddin werecoordinated and funded by the CIA and Britain’s MI6 via Pakistan intelligence.The US later arranged for the arrival of Osama bin Laden from Saudi Arabia andthe mujaheddin names on the CIA database became known as ‘Al-Qaeda’, or ‘TheBase’. In a 1998 interview with the French newspaper, Nouvel Observateur,Brzezinski revealed that CIA support for the mujaheddin started before theSoviet invasion, and was actually designed to goad them into invading.Brzezinski wanted to entrap the Soviets in a Vietnam-type war with all theslaughter and suffering that followed, but that’s not something that wouldbother him or his like. As he said: ‘What is most important to the history ofthe world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-upMoslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?’Actually, it was all part of the agenda that led to 9/11 and the ‘war on terror’which are now being used to justify the Orwellian global state. Now, wait forthis: Brzezinski is the mentor and controller of … Barack Obama. More about thislater.Brzezinski wrote many of the speeches for Jimmy Carter in the campaign that madehim the Trilateral Commission’s first President of the United States, althoughnot the last. It became a standing joke among insiders that whenever Carter wasfaced with a decision or document involving foreign policy, he would say ‘Clearit with Brzezinski’ or ‘Has Brzezinski seen this?’ Carter repaid his sponsors byappointing a long list of Trilateral Commission names to his government. Theyincluded: Walter Mondale, the Vice-President; Cyrus Vance, the Secretary ofState; Warren Christopher, the Deputy Secretary of State; Harold Brown (alsoCFR), Secretary for Defense; W. Michael Blumenthal (also CFR), Secretary of theTreasury; C. Fred Bergsten (also CFR and Bilderberg Group), Assistant Secretaryof the Treasury for International Affairs; Henry Owen (also CFR), theambassador-at-large and the President’s special representative for economicsummits; Paul C. Warnke (also CFR), chief disarmament negotiator; Andrew Young(also CFR), Ambassador to the United Nations; Paul A. Volcker (also CFR andBilderberg Group), Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; and … ZbigniewBrzezinski (also CFR and Bilderberg Group), the National Security Advisor. So itis with all American governments, Republican or Democrat. It doesn’t matter whoyou vote for because the secret government still gets in. Another example is theUS ‘central bank’, the Federal Reserve, which is actually controlled by theRothschild cabal. Paul Volcker (Trilateral Commission, CFR and Bilderberg Group)was made head of the ‘Fed’ by ‘Democrat’ Carter on the instructions of DavidRockefeller. Volcker was reappointed by the ‘Republican’ Reagan–Father Bushadministration, and he was followed by Alan Greenspan (Trilateral Commission,CFR and Bilderberg Group). Greenspan was appointed by the ‘Republicans’Reagan–Bush, and reappointed by ‘Republican’ president Father Bush, ‘Democrat’Bill Clinton and ‘Republican’ Boy George Bush. The current North Americanchairman of the Trilateral Commission is Tom Foley (also CFR and BilderbergGroup), former Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Europeanchairman is Peter D. Sutherland (also Bilderberg Group), the chairman of BP andGoldman Sachs. Sutherland has been a long-time manipulator of the global agendaand he was the Director General of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, the forerunner of the WTO – the World Trade Organisation. The WTO is aReptilian hybrid creation designed to dictate world ‘trade’ and stop any countrydefending its own economy from the centralised dictatorship.Club of RomeThe Club of Rome, launched in 1968, is a Round Table strand with an archetypalCV. It describes itself as ‘a global think tank and centre of innovation andinitiative’, and a non-profit, non-govermental organisation, or ‘NGO’. The Clubof Rome website says the organisation ‘brings together scientists, economists,businessmen, international high civil servants, heads of state and former headsof state from all five continents who are convinced that the future of humankindis not determined once and for all, and that each human being can contribute tothe improvement of our societies’. It’s a club alright, and it’s connected toRome, but the improvement of societies bit is laughable. The Club of Rome hasbeen one of the major manipulators of the environmental movement.That is a summary of the main Round Table network and it will come up again aswe proceed. It is an extremely significant grouping where the Illuminati caninterface with the wider world of political decision making. There are someresearchers into the global conspiracy who appear to believe that the BilderbergGroup and its associated organisations are the conspiracy, though this is notthe case. They are part of it, but subordinate to much more powerful secretsocieties like the Jesuit Order, Knights Templar, Knights of Malta, Opus Dei,the inner sanctum of Freemasonry and the Illuminati leadership, among otherexclusive groups.The tax-break bully boysAnother network that connects with the Round Table cabal are called ‘tax-exemptfoundations’ and you may have noted some of them in this chapter who fund RoundTable organisations. In the United States they include the RockefellerFoundation, Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment for International ‘Peace’ and soon. These have an interlocking leadership to advance the plan for globaldomination by donating tax-free money from the elite families and corporationsto causes that serve their ambitions. These have their equivalent in othercountries. The early funding for the Trilateral Commission came from DavidRockefeller, the Ford Foundation, Kettering Foundation, Lilly Endowment,Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Thyssen Foundation. It is a similar story withall of the Round Table organisations. Among the attendees of the firstBilderberg meeting in 1954 were David Rockefeller from the Council on ForeignRelations and Rockefeller Foundation; Dean Rusk, a Council on Foreign Relationsmember, Rhodes Scholar and head of the Rockefeller Foundation; and Joseph E.Johnson of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was head of the CarnegieEndowment for International Peace. While the people pay taxes to fund theOrwellian nightmare through government, these foundations provide tax breaks forthe elite families and corporations to fund the fascist state from theirextraordinary annual profits. They are portrayed as vehicles for philanthropywhen they are another channel to support the global conspiracy. They wereexposed (but nothing done about it) by the Reece Committee investigation in theUnited States in the 1950s, headed by Congressman Carroll B. Reece. One of itsfindings was that when the mega rich families ‘gave’ money to these foundationsthey did not lose control of how it was spent. It also established that:> •The major foundations are interconnected and work to a common policy.> •They took over social science in the US and suppress social scientists who> disagree with their plans.> •‘Research’ sponsored by the foundations is often slanted to conform to the> conclusions that the funders demand.> •Those educational institutions which refuse to conform are denied a grant.> •The writing of history is being funded by these foundations to keep the truth> from the people.There are thousands of tax-exempt foundations (known as charities or charityfoundations in Britain) and not all of them are there to manipulate or knowinglymanipulate. However, major ones are doing just that and we are talkingextraordinary amounts of money. The biggest today is the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation, which alone has an endowment of some $27 billion and has investedheavily in vaccination programmes, of which more later. The second-largest isthe Howard Hughes Medical Institute ($11 billion). In the UK, there is theBritish Wellcome Trust, which was connected to the pharmaceutical corporation,Burroughs Wellcome, now absorbed into the appalling GlaxoSmithKline. Somefoundations are set up with the best of intentions, but the most significantones are using the tax exemption to funnel money from the corporations into‘research’, grants and programmes that support Reptilian hybrid goals. The ReeceCommittee investigation found that the Ford Foundation gave a million dollars tothe Council on Foreign Relations, one of the major groups in the United Statesbehind manipulation of the centralised global state. The chief Reeceinvestigator, Norman Dodd, reported that the then President of the FordFoundation, H. Rowan Gaither, told him that it operated under directives fromthe White House. Or, to quote him directly:> Mr. Dodd, we are here to operate in response to similar directives, the> substance of which is that we shall use our grant-making power to so alter> life in the United States, that it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet> Union. This policy has continued ever since and Norman Dodd also established that theCarnegie Endowment for International ‘Peace’ was dedicated to engineering war.Illuminati organisations are invariably given names that describe the veryopposite of what they are really there to do. Dodd said that at one meeting ofthe Carnegie trustees, the question was asked: ‘Is there any means known to manmore effective than war if you want to alter the lives of an entire people?’ Itwas decided there was not, and so the next question they asked was: ‘How do weinvolve the United States in a war?’ – the First World War in this case. NormanDodd’s report went on:> And then they raised the question: ‘How do we control the diplomatic machinery> of the United States?’ And the answer came out: ‘We must control the State> Department’. At this point we catch up with what we had already found out …> that through an agency set up by the Carnegie Endowment; every high> appointment in the State Department was cleared. > Finally we were in a war. These trustees in a meeting about 1917 had the> brashness to congratulate themselves on the wisdom of their original decision> because already the impact of the war had indicated it would alter life and> can alter life in this country. This was the date of our entry in the war; we> were involved. They even had the brashness to word and to dispatch a telegram> to [US President] Mr. Wilson; cautioning him to see that the war did not end> too quickly. Dodd said that his colleague, Kathryn Casey, found other minutes dealing withthe work of the Carnegie Endowment to prevent American life returning to itspre-war state. Changing the way people lived and thought was, after all, a mainpoint of the war. Dodd reported:> … they came to the conclusion that, to prevent a reversion, they must control> education. And then they approached the Rockefeller Foundation and they said:> ‘Will you take on the acquisition of control of education as it involves> subjects that are domestic in their significance’. And it was agreed. Then> together they decided that the key to it was the teaching of American history> and they must change that. So, they then approached the most prominent of what> we might call American historians at that time with the idea of getting them> to alter the manner in which they presented the subject. Dodd said the Carnegie group approached four of the most prominent teachers ofAmerican history in the country, but their offers were rejected. Instead, theydecided to ‘build our own stable of historians’. They went to the GuggenheimFoundation, which specialised in fellowships, and came to an agreement thatfellowships would be granted to people chosen by the Endowment who were studyingfor doctorates in American history. They got together twenty such people andthey were taken to London to be briefed on what was expected of them. Note, noteven to Washington, but to London, the major Illuminati operational centre. Thisgroup became the core of the American Historical Association. Towards the end ofthe 1920’s, the Endowment granted $400,000 to the American HistoricalAssociation for a study of history which pointed to where the country should goin the future. A seven-volume study was produced and concluded that the futureof America belonged to collectivism – centralisation of power. These foundationslike the Carnegie Endowment, once headed by Soviet spy Alger Hiss, seamlesslyconnect with the Round Table network and others in the Illuminati web.Norman Dodd’s assistant Kathryn Casey had begun her research reluctantly, sayingthe foundations were doing a good job; but she was so shocked by what she foundthat she was never able to return to her law practice. Dodd said she eventuallylost her mind because of it. Naturally, these findings and proofs were sodevastating that they had to be crushed by the web they were exposing. Secrecyis always its most essential ingredient. Pressure was applied from every angleto close down the hearings, including, as usual, claims that the investigationwas guilty of ‘anti-Semitism’. Samuel Johnson said that patriotism is the lastrefuge of the scoundrel, but I think that hurling the abuse of anti-Semitism atthose engaged in legitimate investigation has got to be one step further downthe sewer even than that. What I am describing is not a summary of somehistorical period now passed. It is what is happening on a massive scale todayall over the world. What Dodd uncovered has never stopped – just expanded. Whenyou see ‘experts’ wheeled out in the media it is worth asking: Where are theyfrom? Who is funding them? Are they trying to sell the agenda of control andcentralisation? If they are funded by these foundations the answer willinvariably be ‘yes’.A man you can trustOne of the most high-profile foundations today is headed by former US President,Bill Clinton. He says that he launched the Clinton Foundation because he wantedto help good people make a difference and he didn’t want anyone to die beforetheir time. Well, that’s certainly new territory for him and hiswife-of-convenience given the body count in their wake over the years in bothArkansas and Washington. Clinton is obsessed with many things – sex, cocaine,anything corrupt that brings him a dollar. But wanting people not to die beforetheir time, or allowing good people to make a difference? Excuse me if I pass onthat one, Bill, or my sides are destined to split. It was announced that theClinton Foundation had struck a deal to provide cheaper Aids testing andtreatment in developing countries. On the face of it people would think that wasa worthy achievement – good ol’ Bill. There is, however, a little more to know.Clinton is a willing – and life-long – puppet of the Illuminati which is behindthe plague of Aids in places like Africa. It is part of their plan to depopulatethe ‘lower races’ as long outlined in my books. Why the hell would this sameIlluminati support Bill Clinton to – apparently – seek to do the opposite? It isa scam, because with Clinton there’s always a scam. Whatever this is all aboutyou can be sure that it is not designed to help people with Aids.The guy has spent his entire political career trying to stop good people makinga difference and millions have left this world as a consequence of his actions.The Clinton–Blair sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s alone caused the deaths ofmore than half a million children (low-side estimate), according to UNorganisations. Why the sudden transformation in the man who would be my firstchoice, together with Bush and Blair, to represent the Earth in anyinter-planetary lying championship? There has been, it hardly needs to be said,no transformation. His ‘philanthropic’, William J. Clinton Foundation, is justthe latest deceit in a career built on fake compassion. Clinton and formerBritish Prime Minister, Tony ‘fake emotion’ Blair, emerged from the same mould,or Reptilian egg, and no wonder they get on so well and led thesanctions-slaughter on Iraq with such gusto. Clinton is not a leader in theIlluminati hierarchy, he’s a follower. He does what he’s told to do and reapsthe benefits of compliance. Clinton is taking on the mantle of MikhailGorbachev, the man who oversaw the break up of the Soviet Union in line with theIlluminati timescale for absorbing those Russian colonies into NATO and theEuropean Union. When he had served his masters, they set him up with the MikhailGorbachev Foundation, also called The International Non- Governmental Foundationfor Socio-Economic and Political Studies. This is forked-tongue speak for ‘TheCampaigning For a World Government Foundation’. The Clinton Foundation isbasically Gorbachev Mark II. With the former Soviet Union leader falling fromthe ‘A’ list, step forward Bill ‘where’s the camera?’ Clinton to grasp thebaton. Same game, different name.They say you can tell a man by the company he keeps and Clinton (Council onForeign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group and many more elitesecret societies) certainly keeps some seriously unpleasant company. He is asubordinate in the hierarchy to his predecessor as president, Father GeorgeBush. Readers of my books will recall the fun these two have had abusingmind-controlled slaves – women in Clinton’s case, children in Bush’s. Now, theyturn up at the scenes of disasters like the Asian tsunami representing the needfor compassion and support. The Clinton Foundation’s global gatherings to ‘helpthe poor and needy’ are attended by the very people who are pursuing policiesthat have caused devastation throughout the very ‘developing countries’ thatClinton claims to be seeking to support. People such as Tony Blair; Secretary ofState Condoleezza Rice; Paul Wolfowitz, an architect of the Iraq invasion;Madeleine Albright, Clinton’s Secretary of State and Iraq sanctions-enforcer; AlGore, his former deputy; and Bill’s cover-story-on-the-arm, Hillary ‘what do Ihave to say to win?’ Rodham-Clinton. Alongside them are a long list of leadingindustrialists and financiers, including George ‘I am so compassionate and makeso much money by playing the markets that kill millions of the people I am socompassionate about’ Soros (another major Obama backer). For goodness sake, evenRupert Murdoch has been trotted out, not a man who could ever be in danger ofcompassion fatigue, given that he has none to start with. What a joke it all is.Finance is never a problem when you serve the Dragon and among Clinton’sunderwriters are the Rockefeller Foundation, Hewlett- Packard, Goldman Sachs andCitigroup, together with support from Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and Starbucks.Do what we say, Bill, and money’s no object. One of Clinton’s great assets isselling the lie and ‘nice guy’ Bill is real Hollywood friendly. The so-called‘Tinsel Town Lefties’ like Leonardo DiCaprio, Barbra Streisand, Mick Jagger,Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Oprah Winfrey gleefully turn out to support theirking, Clinton the Crooked, and their queen, Hillary the Vicious (later eclipsedin Hollywood’s affections by Obama the Fraud). These people mean well, I’m sure,but they have been suckered. So have sycophants like Tina Brown at TheWashington Post who somehow see substance in the shameful. She wrote of Clintonat one of his Foundation jollies:> On Clinton’s face these days is a look of wry, judicious knowingness. It’s the> look of political wisdom, and it imparted to his conference’s departing crowd> something like serenity. It’s the look of a crook, Tina. It’s the only one he has."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 9 Modus operandi > When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a> cross. > Sinclair Lewis The Reptilian hybrids have a ‘modus operandi’ – ‘a method of operating orfunctioning’ – which they have been using for thousands of years. As you charttheir despicable path through ‘history’, you see its fingerprints wherever theygo; and ‘modus’ number one is always the constant centralisation of power.When there are only a few of you compared with the target population, you haveto centralise decision-making if you are to have dominion over them. The morediversity of decision-making there is, the less control the few can have overthe many. And, the more you centralise, the more power you have to centraliseeven quicker. This is why the process of centralisation has got faster andfaster through the 20th century to present day in all areas of our lives. It ispart of a war on diversity in all its forms, including thought. At first, humanslived in small communities and tribes that made decisions for themselves. Then,these tribes were brought together into what we call nations and countries, andnow the next stage of the plan is unfolding, the amalgamation of nations intosuperstates like the European Union. This is but one step from their ultimategoal of world government – world dictatorship. With each phase of the plan,decision-making has moved further and further away from the people affected bythose decisions. From tribal leaders, the power went to kings, queens,presidents and prime ministers, and today we have the superstate bureaucrats whodon’t even go through the sleight of hand we call ‘elections’. All the time, theinfluence and control of the Reptilian hybrids has increased as they havecentralised power, and manipulated themselves, or their agents, into theever-more powerful positions created by that centralisation. Today, the globalpolitical and banking system, transnational corporations and media are allcontrolled by the Reptilian hybrids, and they continue to pursue even greatercentralisation through merger and take-over. Even now, the power of thetransnationals is incredible with their income and profits greater than mostcountries, and their hierarchies connect with the secret society network topursue the common goal. Most of the political ‘leaders’ in places like Africasince ‘independence’ have been installed by the transnationals to rule thecountries for their benefit. At the highest levels, these corporations interlockso they are, in effect, one corporation, and it’s the same with the banks. Theymay go under different names, and most of their employees may think they arecompeting with other banks or corporations, but if you go high enough thecontrol is in the same hands.Image [../Images/00124.jpg]Figure 119: The Reptilian hybrid pyramids of control. Smaller pyramids areencompassed by bigger ones and a global pyramid overlays them all. At the topare the elite Reptilian bloodlines who dictate policy down all the other,apparently unconnected, pyramids that control society This is possible because of the ‘Russian doll’ structure the Reptilian hybridshave developed of pyramids within pyramids (Figure 119). The samecompartmentalisation of knowledge used by secret societies is repeated in thestructure of government, banking, business and every other organisation andinstitution. Only the few at the top of the ‘individual’ pyramids know the realagenda and what the organisation is trying to achieve. The further you go downthe pyramid, the more people are involved in the organisation, but the less theyknow about its real agenda. They are only aware of the job they do every day.They don’t know how their contribution (apparently innocent in isolation)connects with those of other employees in other areas of the company, governmentor whatever. They are ‘compartmentalised’ and the only people who know how itall fits together are the very few at the top – the Reptilian hybrid families.The smaller pyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger andbigger pyramids, until eventually you have the pyramid that encompasses all ofthe banks. The same applies everywhere and this allows the transnationalcorporations, major (and many smaller) political parties, secret societies,media empires and the military (via NATO, for instance), to be controlled by thesame families who sit atop the biggest pyramids. In the end, there is a globalpyramid, the biggest ‘doll’, which envelops all the others. At the capstone ofthis you will find the most elite of the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines, believedto be no more than thirteen, and even these have their hierarchy. The numberthirteen is highly significant to the Reptilians and must, therefore, relate insome way to the codes of the Matrix reality construct that they aremanipulating. Jesus, Horus and all these aliases for Tammuz/Nimrod had twelvefollowers, together making thirteen. Stewart Swerdlow names the thirteenfamilies in Blue Blood, True Blood as: Rothschild (Bauer), Bruce, Cavendish(Kennedy), de Medici, Hanover, Hapsburg [Habsburg], Krupps, Plantagenet,Rockefeller, Romanov, Sinclair/St Clair, Warburg (del Banco) and Windsor (theGerman house of Saxe-Coburg-Gothe). Other researchers give slightly differentnames, but the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Windsors are always named. I shouldstress that these are bloodlines, actually computer programs, and they willoften go under different names as they use other families to bring up childrenor impregnate women through their sperm banks. Arizona Wilder, a recoveringmind-slave of the US government, conducted rituals with the Illuminati. She toldme that the highest-ranked person she had been aware of was known, at least toinsiders, as the ‘Marquis de Libeaux’. He lived in the Reptilian bloodlinecentre of Alsace-Lorraine in France, a region that has also been in Germanhands. Arizona said that he was also known as ‘Pindar’, or ‘Penis of theDragon’. Stewart Swerdlow says that Pindar, or ‘Pinnacle of the Draco’ in hisinterpretation, is the head of the Rothschild family who ‘reports to thepure-bred Reptilian leader in the inner-earth’.Image [../Images/00125.jpg]Figure 120: The motto of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry:Ordo Ab Chao – Order Out Of Chaos, or Problem-Reaction- Solution Through the pyramid within pyramid structure, the elite families can coordinatethe same policies through apparently unconnected, even ‘opposing’, areas ofsociety. All roads lead eventually to them – everything from the food we eat;the water we drink; the ‘medical care’ we receive, including vaccines; the‘news’ we watch, hear and read; the ‘entertainment’ we are given; thegovernments that dictate to us; the military that enforces the will of thegovernments; and the drug-running network aimed at destroying young people. Thesame families and their pathetic yes-men control all of these areas and muchmore, because from the top of the global pyramid the bloodline families candictate the same policies, like centralisation, through all the other pyramids.It is worth emphasising that this structure means that comparatively few‘in-the-know’ people are required to control the whole system. If you controlthe President or Prime Minister, for example, you control who they ‘choose’ tohead the government departments, like Secretary of State, Secretary of Defenceand so on. These, in turn, select their staff and pursue policies in line withthe guidelines that come from ‘the top’. Everyone else just does as they’re toldand serve the desires of those ‘on high’. You don’t need to control every policeofficer to control law enforcement. You just need your people at those levels ofthe police where decisions are made about prosecuting someone or looking theother way. It is the same with all the institutions, corporations, banks, media,etc. Control the few prime positions of power and you dictate the actions ofeveryone else in the structure, those who are ‘just doing their job’. The secretsociety network ensures that those critical positions go to the ‘right people’.Problem-Reaction-SolutionMany years ago I coined the term ‘Problem-Reaction-Solution’ to describe themost effective of all Illuminati manipulation techniques, especially forcentralising power. The motto of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry is ‘Ordo Ab Chao’, which means ‘Order out of chaos’, and thisencapsutates the Problem-Reaction-Solution technique (Figure 120). Understandinghow this works is to immediately become seriously more street-wise about dailyevents and their real background. The Reptilian hybrids useProblem-Reaction-Solution (P-R-S) whenever they know that changes they want tomake in society will attract considerable public resistance. It works like this:Firstly they secretly create a problem while blaming someone else; next theytell the population through an unquestioning media a false version of theproblem that they want them to believe; through this, they manipulate a publicreaction of fear, outrage, and demands that ‘something must be done’; thisallows those who have covertly engineered the ‘problem’ to then openly offer thesolution – changes in society that they wanted all along. This works so wellthat people who would have opposed those changes before the ‘problem’, willeither accept them without protest, or even campaign for them as a ‘solution’ tothe ‘problem’. Look how often we hear people say in these situations: ‘We don’twant to see freedoms restricted, but after what has happened we have no choice’.Problem-Reaction-Solution.I have just described the real reason for the horrific events of September 11th2001 when the Reptilian hybrids created the problem of those attacks whileblaming the CIA asset Osama bin Laden, who in no way was the orchestrator. Theytold the global public a tapestry of lies about happened, who did it and why,and there was mass fear and outrage. This allowed them to introduce legislation,like the US Patriot Act, to destroy basic human rights and freedoms and launchthe bogus ‘war on terror’. This is nothing more than a war of conquest andacquisition designed to explode into an even bigger problem which, they willsay, only a world government and army would have the power to solve. I willdiscuss 9/11 in greater detail later. The reason that freedom-bustinglegislation went through so easily after September 11th was the manipulatedperception that people had to be protected from the ‘terrorists’ when theterrorists were actually the very leaders and their masters who were proposingthe legislation. That’s how Problem-Reaction-Solution works and the ‘problem’can be anything from a war, ‘terrorist attack’, government or stock marketcollapse, political ‘scandal’ – anything that will lead to the desired‘solution’. There is also another version that I call NoProblem-Reaction-Solution. This was most famously played out with the claims ofweapons of mass destruction in Iraq that turned out to be pure invention. Youdon’t even need a real problem, just the perception of one, to lay waste anentire country. Problem-Reaction-Solution is being played out in the Middle Eastby the day. In September 2005, two British soldiers from SAS special forcesdressed as Arabs and wearing wigs were arrested by Iraqi police after failing tostop at a roadblock in Basra. The men opened fire, killing one Iraqi policemanand wounding another, before they were captured. In their unmarked vehicle,these British elite soldiers, in their Arab disguise, had weapons, explosivesand a remote-control detonator. The car was booby-trapped and ready to explode.It was clear what the intention was – to set up a manufactured ‘terroristattack’ to be blamed on ‘insurgents’. Such things have happened many times inIsrael over the years. The British authorities were so desperate to spring theirmen before the full truth could come out that they used tanks to storm the Iraqipolice station where they were being held. They ‘rescued’ the two agentprovocateurs (Figure 121, overleaf) and took away their vehicle. Phew, that wasclose.Problem-Reaction-Solution would be impossible if we had a media that in any wayrelated to the term ‘journalism’. When the make-believe official story was beingpedalled real journalists would question it, investigate it, and find it to bethe nonsense it invariably is. They would then report their findings to thepeople and the public ‘reaction’ would be very different to the one desired bythe manipulators. Instead, the mainstream media across the world is sobreathtakingly pathetic that Problem-Reaction-Solution works perfectly almostevery time. What’s even worse about the arrogant, gutless and mendacious mediais that not only do they refuse to investigate these official fairytalesthemselves – they ridicule and condemn those who do. One brainless BBCinterviewer suggested that I was causing terrible suffering to the families wholost loved ones on 9/11 by investigating and exposing those who were trulyresponsible. I worked in the media for a long time, including the national newsand current affairs operation of the BBC, and when you see the arrogance andignorance that stands between what happens in the world and what people are toldis happening it could turn you to drink. You can see Problem-Reaction-Solutionplayed out day after day in the media worldwide and the most effective antidoteis to ask this question: ‘Who benefits from me believing this version of events,or accepting the solutions and changes being suggested?’ The answer will be, aswith all P-R-S scenarios, anyone who wishes to centralise power and suppressmore of our freedoms.Image [../Images/00126.jpg]Figure 121: The two British SAS soldiers who were arrested by Iraqi police inBasra while dressed as Arabs, complete with wigs.

The Totalitarian Tiptoe is the use of ministeps to hide from the people where you are actually taking them. Each step ispresented in isolation and portrayed as unconnected to all the others. Thistechnique was used most obviously with the superstate now known as the EuropeanUnion and is being employed again to impose similar superstates in the Americas,Africa and the Asia/Pacific region. After the Second World War, if thepoliticians had suggested a centralised Europe with common laws and currencythere would have been an outcry. People would have said they had been fightingHitler to stop just such a European dictatorship and there was no way they wereaccepting another. To overcome this, the Reptilian hybrids offered a ‘free tradearea’ (‘good for jobs’) and they have used the Totalitarian Tiptoe’s drip, drip,drip method to constantly centralise power until now they have the Europeandictatorship they wanted all along – with more to come. The daily demolition ofhuman freedom has become a tidal wave since 9/11 and this is also theTotalitarian Tiptoe at work, although it is now more like a Totalitarian sprint.Once people get used to one imposition or new control the next one isintroduced. This method has been likened to a frog placed in a saucepan of waterthat is warmed up slowly so the frog gets used to each rise in temperature untilit finally boils. If the frog was given the boiling water to start with, itwould react immediately. To use the same analogy, people who support the ‘war onterrorism’ are saying that the water needs to be made even hotter to protectthem from getting boiled!Running alongside P-R-S and the Totalitarian Tiptoe is what I call the diversiontechnique. This is aimed at getting people to focus on the irrelevant so theydon’t see what they are not meant to see. It is the same principle as a stagemagician or illusionist who manipulates the audience to focus their attention onsomething while the ‘trick’ happens elsewhere. The Reptilian hybrids are alwaysmanufacturing diversionary events to attract public attention while they do somedastardly deed or quietly slip through legislation that would otherwise faceserious challenge. It is summed up by the Blair government advisor who sent anemail to colleagues on September 11th saying that this was a good day to ‘burybad news’. The media and public focus on sport, television, the movie industryand the cult of celebrity (the latest religion). All are expressions of thediversion technique to keep the public mind occupied while the global fasciststate is introduced by the day. There is a video going around the Internet inwhich the viewer is told to concentrate on the number of times two balls arethrown by a group of people. At the end the viewer is asked: ‘Did you see thegorilla?’ Most, it seems, do not, and yet when the video is played back someonein a gorilla costume clearly walks across the screen. Most people don’t see itbecause their attention, their focus, is on the two balls, as the instructionshave told them. We are constantly told to focus on this or that so we don’t seethe gorilla – or the reptile. Whenever a major story or event, be it ‘natural’disaster or a celebrity scandal, is dominating the headlines, that’s the time tobe even more vigilant. Invariably the attention-taker has either been created,or is being used, as cover for something they don’t want us to see.Money out of nothingAnother foundation of the modus operandi is the control and creation of what wecall ‘money’. This involves ‘creating’ money that doesn’t exist and lending itto people and businesses in return for interest. They call this system ‘credit’and it accumulates enormous debt for governments, business and the generalpopulation. And debt = control. Vital to this has been to allow bankers to lendmoney they do not have, a con-trick that is today called fractional reservelending. The principle has been used since at least Sumer and Babylon to entrapthe people in non-existent ‘debt’ to the Reptilian hybrids. There are records ofloans made by the priests of the temple in Babylon at the time of King Hammurabiin the 18th century BC, and by around 1000 BC the transfer of bank deposits to athird party in Babylon was common. This is the Reptilian hybrid system offinancial control and they have now expanded it worldwide. Among the firstbankers in the western world were the Knights Templar. They were given fantasticriches by Christians supporting the Crusades and by legacies from people whowere hoping to buy a place in heaven. Their temples in Paris and London becamemajor financial centres. The Christian world had a ban on usury (from theMedieval Latin usuria meaning ‘interest’ or ‘excessive interest’), but, as thecenturies passed, this was forgotten and the banking system as we know it beganto expand and develop. The Islamic religion still has a ban on usury, at leastofficially, and these Christian and Islamic restrictions allowed Jewish, that is‘Khazar/Sumerian’, people to dominate money lending for interest. Highlysignificant in the creation of today’s banking system were the bloodlines of theReptilian hybrid ‘Black Nobility’ in Venice and northern Italy, like the deMedici family. The Black Nobility set up great financial centres in the Lombardyregion through the ‘Lombards’, northern Italian merchants who formed merchantguilds, accepted deposits, granted advances and made payments. They particularlytargeted areas where they were not required to pay taxes – their version ofoffshore banking. Lombard became the name given to all Italian bankers inFlorence, Genoa, Venice and Milan and the very word ‘bank’ comes from theItalian ‘banco’, the bench on which money changers sat to conduct theirbusiness. Eventually, they expanded their influence northwards to Hamburg,Amsterdam and London, hence Lombard Street in the City of London financialdistrict.The ‘banking’ currency had at first been precious metals like gold and silver,and for safety reasons the owners began to deposit their wealth with thegoldsmiths, who had suitable strong rooms. Former Khazars, the Ashkenazi people,were the prime force behind the gold trade, as seen in the German ‘Jewish’ nameGoldschmidt. The goldsmiths would issue paper receipts for gold and silverdeposited with them and the owners would pay their debts by withdrawing portionsof their ‘deposits’ as necessary. It was obviously an unwieldy process to moveall those metals around and the paper receipts slowly became accepted ascurrency. The gold and silver were rarely moved, but the ownership changed withthe issuing of receipts (‘money’) to pay off debts. In the same way today, vastfortunes are made by simply moving numbers between one computer file andanother. The goldsmiths and other owners of the strong rooms began to realisethat, at any one time, only a fraction of the gold and silver was beingwithdrawn by the owners and they began to issue notes (money) to others whodidn’t own the gold and silver. They charged interest for doing this – interestfor lending other people’s wealth. This is what banking is. The only way theruse could fail was if they issued too many notes and too many people came alongat the same time to cash them in for gold and silver.They began to issue notes for the ownership of the precious metals greatly inexcess of the amount of gold and silver they had deposited in their vaults. Inthe end, most of the notes they lent (and earned interest on) were related togold and silver which the ‘banks’ did not even have, but since only a smallamount of the metals was being withdrawn at any one time, they were in theclear. They could issue lots of bits of paper for gold and silver that didn’texist and charge interest for doing so. There, in one sentence, you have adescription of today’s banking system, which pretty much controls the world.People and governments are submerged in debt and desperately trying to payinterest on money that has never, does not, and will never exist. It is reckonedthat on average, for every £1,000 a bank receives from customers, it lends (andcharges interest upon) at least £10,000. It is able to do this through thefractional reserve system, which means they only have to keep a fraction (aboutone-tenth) of their total deposits in the bank, or in ‘reserve’. Once again, itonly works if too many customers don’t demand their money back at the same time,but that is rare and only happens if rumours circulate about a bank’s stability.In most countries where banks are regulated there are rules or laws which allowa bank to shut its doors if too many people want their money out at once. Noticehow banks have restrictions on how much of your own money you can withdraw incash each day. Once you make a deposit the banks basically treat your wealth astheir own. Money in the bank is a myth, anyway, another confidence trick,although even most bank employees don’t realise this, nor highly paidaccountants and economics correspondents. A man attended a weekend event Ipresented many years ago who had spent most of his working life in the bankingsystem. He became a bank manager agreeing endless times to make loans to peopleand businesses and yet it was only in his final year before retirement, when thebank moved him into a research project, that he realised how ‘money’ is created– or rather isn’t. ‘There is no money, is there?’, I remember him saying to me,a bewildered look on his face. Most of the ‘money’ in circulation is notphysical money, cash and coins. It is represented by figures passing from onecomputer account to another electronically via money transfers, credit cards andchequebooks – the modern-day version of the certificates issued by thegoldsmiths. The Reptilian hybrids are withdrawing ‘physical’ cash fromcirculation all the time and they want to replace all currencies with a singleglobal electronic currency because that would mean they could deny anyone accessto money by coding the system to refuse their cards or, in the end, theirmicrochip.Manufactured ‘boom’ and ‘bust’If you or I have a million pounds we can only lend a million pounds; but if abank has a million pounds it can lend ten times that (much more in truth) andcharge interest on it. When you go into a bank and ask for a loan, the bank doesnot print a single new note, or mint a single new coin. It merely types theamount of the loan into your account. From that moment, you are paying interestto the bank on what is no more than figures typed on a screen. But, if you failto pay back that non-existent loan, the bank can come along and quite legallytake your wealth that does exist … your home, land, car and possessions, to theestimated value of whatever figure was typed on to that screen – plus interest.Money is overwhelmingly brought into circulation by private banks making loansto customers and not by governments. This means that the banks control how muchmoney is in circulation. The more loans they choose to make, the more money isin circulation and vice-versa. What is the difference between an economic boomand an economic depression? One thing only – the amount of money in circulation.Through this system, the private banks, controlled by the same Reptilian hybridfamilies, decide how much money will be issued and circulated. This allows themto create booms and busts at will. It is the same with the stock markets throughwhich these families are moving trillions of dollars a day around the financialand banking system and deciding if they go up or down, soar or crash. Stockmarket crashes don’t just happen, they are made to happen. Why would they dothis when they have so much money invested in these markets? Well, if you knowthe crash is coming because you are going to cause it, you know to sell stocksat the highest point and buy them back once the crash has happened. In this way,you can increase your holdings massively by acquiring companies at a fraction ofthe cost before your manipulated collapse.Perhaps the most blatant example of this was Nathan Rothschild during the Battleof Waterloo in 1815. The situation was simple: if England’s Duke of Wellingtonwon the battle the London Stock Exchange would soar, and if Napoleon, the Frenchleader, prevailed it would collapse. The Rothschilds ran an information andespionage operation renowned as the fastest in Europe with an extensive networkof contacts that used codes and carrier pigeons to communicate secretly andquickly. As I have indicated, this intelligence network would eventually developinto Mossad, the ‘Israeli’ intelligence arm today, as well as the CIA and themodern version of British intelligence. At the highest level, they are all thesame organisation. In 1815, investors at the London Stock Exchange knew theRothschild intelligence system was better than the British government’s, andwith the battle raging all eyes were on Nathan Rothschild, the head of thefamily’s London operation, for any sign of what was happening. Had Wellington orNapoleon won? Rothschild gave the signal for his agents to start selling hisstocks and everyone else followed believing that Rothschild must know thatWellington had lost. The market collapsed in the panic and people lost fortunes,but not Rothschild. He gave another coded signal to his agents and they beganbuying the stocks at the knock-down prices before the official news reachedLondon that Wellington had won the battle, a fact that Rothschild had known allalong thanks to his communication network. Stock prices soared and it isestimated that the Rothschilds increased their wealth some twenty times on thatone day alone. This is how the manipulation works and it is happening every dayall over the world, especially through Wall Street, the City of London and theFar East.The more money that’s in circulation, the more economic activity can take place.This means that people have more income, more job opportunities and moreproducts are bought and sold. But, a constant theme of this Reptilian hybridfinancial coup has been to create a boom by making lots of loans, and thenpulling the plug, causing a depression or crash. Overpaid economists andeconomic correspondents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tellyou that boom and bust is part of some natural ‘economic cycle’. It is not. Itis systematic manipulation to steal the wealth of the world. During a boom manypeople get themselves into more debt. The vibrant economic activity means thatbusinesses borrow more for new technology to increase production to meet demand.People borrow more to buy a bigger house and a more expensive car, because theyare so confident of their economic prospects, and businesses borrow money (freshair in truth) to invest in new plant and machinery to meet demand. Then, at themost opportune moment, the major banks, coordinated by the Illuminati pyramidnetwork, raise interest rates to suppress the demand for loans and begin to callin loans already outstanding. They also ensure they make far fewer loans thanbefore. All this has the effect of taking units of exchange (money in itsvarious forms) out of circulation. When there is not enough money in circulationto generate the necessary economic activity, demand for products is suppressedand this leads to fewer jobs. People and businesses, through no fault of theirown, can no longer earn enough to repay their loans and they go bankrupt. Thebanks then take over their real wealth, their business, home, land, car andother possessions – in return for non-repayment of a loan that was never morethan figures typed on a screen.This has been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the lastfew centuries, and the wealth of the world has been sucked out of the populationand into the hands of those who control the banking system – the major Reptilianhybrid families like the Rothschilds. The same applies to countries. Instead ofcreating their own interest-free money, as they so easily could, governmentsborrow it from the private banking cartel and pay the interest and the capital(sometimes) by taxation of the people. An enormous amount of the money that youpay in taxes goes straight to the private banks to pay back interest on ‘money’that governments could create themselves interest-free. They don’t do thatbecause the Illuminati control the governments as much as they control thebanks. What we call ‘privatisation’ is the selling of state assets in responseto bank-created debt. The world’s poorest countries are handing over control oftheir land and resources to the bankers when they can’t pay back the loans made,on purpose, to ensnare them in this very situation. ‘Third World Debt’ wasmanufactured to replace the physical occupation of resource-rich orstrategically situated countries under colonialism with today’s financialoccupation. The way they created this situation is told in detail in And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. Once an African country is indebted to foreign banks,even though the money is non-existent credit, they are forced to hand overcontrol of their affairs to the bankers, the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund, which then dictate economic and social policy at every level.They force them to cut spending on social programmes, education and humanitarianprojects so they can pay the banks the ‘debt’ they owe. The world does not haveto be in poverty and conflict. It is manipulated to be that way because itserves the Reptilian agenda.Coordinated corruptionToday, the global financial nexus is coordinated by ‘central banks’ in almostevery country. These appear to be working independently, but are in fact workingtogether to a common end. The Rothschild-controlled Bank of England, charteredby the Black Nobility’s William of Orange in 1694, has been a centralmanipulator in this web, and now the Rothschild-controlled, privately-ownedFederal Reserve in the United States is a highly significant player. Ironically,the Federal Reserve is neither federal, nor has any reserve. The Reptilianhybrid bankers and politicians met at a place called Jekyll Island in Georgia in1910 to plot their strategy to impose the Federal Reserve, and among them wasSenator Nelson Aldrich, the grandfather of Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller (the fourtimes Mayor of New York and the Vice-President of the United States underPresident Ford). Aldrich’s daughter, Abby, was married to John D. RockefellerJr. For years after the meeting on Jekyll Island, the ‘educators’, commentatorsand ‘historians’ denied that it even took place. In 1902, the Rothschilds sentone of their agents, Paul Warburg, to America with his brother Felix to‘rearrange’ US banking to suit Rothschild and Reptilian hybrid interests.Another brother, Max Warburg, stayed at home in Frankfurt, Germany, to run thefamily banking business there. Max was a director of the chemical giant I.G.Farben that funded Hitler and ran the Auschwitz concentration camp, and Paul wasa director of Farben’s American operation. Like the Rothschilds, both wereKhazar/Sumerians, or ‘Jewish’, so what were they doing working so closely withNazi corporations? After arriving in the US, Paul Warburg married Nina Loeb (ofthe Rothschild-controlled, Kuhn, Loeb, and Company) while Felix married FriedaSchiff, the daughter of Jacob Schiff, the head of Kuhn, Loeb, and Co, and theguy who helped to fund the Russian Revolution. Some good old Reptilianinterbreeding followed and this is typical of the way the bloodlines operate,marrying for genetic and financial reasons. When Jacob Schiff arrived in Americato join Kuhn, Loeb, and Co, he married the daughter of Solomon Loeb. It is wellknown that the official ‘royal’ families have arranged marriages, but so do theReptilian hybrid ‘royal’ lines that run the government, finance, media andmilitary pyramids.The Federal Reserve Bill, known as the ‘Aldrich Bill’, was passed in 1913 andAmerican debt has soared ever since, just as it was meant to. The FederalReserve System is a cartel of private banks, of which the Bank of New York isthe most powerful. The ‘Fed’ is not owned by the US government as the public areled to believe. As I have explained, the President is told by the cartel who toappoint as chairman of the Federal Reserve, like Paul Volcker (TrilateralCommission, CFR and Bilderberg Group) and Alan Greenspan (Trilateral Commission,CFR and Bilderberg Group). The United States government borrows money, or rather‘credit’, from the ‘Fed’ and taxpayers pay the interest that swells the profitsof the private banks that make up the Federal Reserve System. If you look at an‘American’ banknote it will say: ‘Federal Reserve Note – This note is legaltender for all debts, public and private’. The Federal Reserve is a privatecartel of banks and yet the American paper currency is called a ‘Federal Reservenote’. The Rothschild cabal owns the dollar as it owns sterling and all therest. Indeed, this paper ‘money’ is worth nothing, backed by nothing, and itmeans nothing more than an IOU. British banknotes ‘promise to pay the bearer ondemand the sum of’ whatever the note is said to be worth (Figure 122). If themoney was actually worth anything, the note we hand over would pay the debt, andwould not be just a ‘promise to pay’. That would make it an IOU – which is whatit is. Our money only buys things because we think it is worth something. It’slike a counterfeit note that has purchasing power only until someone holds it tothe light and sees it’s a fake.Image [../Images/00127.jpg]Figure 122: What we call ‘money’ is only an IOU promising to pay at some time inthe ‘future’ The policies of the central banks are coordinated by the Bank of InternationalSettlements (BIS), formed in 1930, and its associated network. The bank’scharter was drafted at the International Bankers Conference (a Reptilian hybridcartel) and the BIS is based in Switzerland, one of the most important centresfor the Illuminati financial web. That’s why Switzerland is never attacked inthe Illuminati-engineered wars. The Bank of International Settlements interlockswith the European Central Bank (established in the Rothschild city of Frankfurtin 1998), World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organisation andothers, to form the iron grip that controls global finance and trade and,therefore, the choices and opportunities of people and countries. Governmentsare at the mercy of the financial system and, because of this, the bankerscontrol the governments. The Reptilian hybrids want to centralise the systemeven more with a world central bank controlling the superstate central banks,which would, in turn, dictate to the national central banks. That would beorgasmic to the hierarchy-obsessed Reptilians. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild said:‘Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws’.Senator Thomas Hart Benton, a fierce opponent of the Bank of the United States,a predecessor of the Federal Reserve, said the following about the consequencesfor freedom of the central banking system, and it is as true today as it everwas. What he describes is exactly what the Reptilian hybrids have been schemingfor:> The government itself ceases to be independent, it ceases to be safe when the> national currency is at the will of a company. The government can undertake no> great enterprise, neither war nor peace, without the consent and co-operation> of that company; it cannot count its revenues six months ahead without> referring to the action of that company – its friendship or its enmity, its> concurrence or opposition – to see how far that company will permit money to> be scarce or to be plentiful; how far it will let the money system go on> regularly or throw it into disorder; how far it will suit their interest or> policy. > People are not safe when such a company has such power. The temptation is too> great, the opportunity too easy, to put up or put down prices, to make and> break fortunes, to bring the whole community upon its knees to the Neptunes> who preside over the flux and reflux of paper. All property is at their mercy,> the price of real estate, of every growing crop, of every staple article in> the market, is at their command. Stocks are their playthings – their gambling> theatre on which they gamble daily … For these very reasons, the agenda is to force every country to have a centralbank and now only a few are left to pick off. The banks interconnect through theIlluminati web with the corporations that control resources, food, water, oil,drugs, manufacturing and so on (Figure 123). The people are sold the lie aboutthe need for ‘free trade’ and ‘competition’ when the Reptilian hybrid modusoperandi has always been to destroy both. Another financial con trick is whatthey call ‘economic growth’. This must be pursued at all costs, apparently, beit in the richest or poorest countries. Economic growth is good: it’s official.But what is it? Economic growth is merely the amount of money changing handsevery year. That’s it. All the money spent clearing an oil slick, responding toa car crash or manufacturing more weaponry to replace the bombs dropped oninnocent people, is all counted by economic growth to be a good thing. Thesystem of accountancy and financial measurement is so ludicrous that it turns anoil slick, car crash or mass bombing into an economic success story. Societiesshould be judging success, economic and otherwise, by the ‘fews’, not the‘mores’. How few people are homeless; how few are hungry; how few are unhappyand unfulfilled; how few are ill? But, the financial and social statistics aregeared to measuring what the Reptilians view as success – more catastrophe,mayhem, destruction and war.Image [../Images/00128.jpg]Figure 123: Artist David Dees symbolises the global control of the Internationalbankers that are dominated by Reptilian hybrids Rigging the systemThe Reptilian hybrids don’t want ‘capitalism’, they want cartelism. They achievethis by rigging the markets and working together to bring everyone under centralcontrol, while conspiring to target those who refuse to play ball. There is nomore blatant example of this than the manipulation of the diamond market tosuppress supply and raise the price, and I will use this to highlight how allthe Reptilian hybrid cartels operate, whether in oil, pharmaceuticals, bankingor whatever. Diamonds are actually not rare, but they can appear to be if youstrictly control the numbers allowed to be sold. The family that controls andcallously manipulates the diamond trade is called Oppenheimer and the familythat controls them is called Rothschild. Their vehicle is the name synonymouswith diamonds … De Beers. It all began in Kimberley, South Africa, in 1871 whena huge quantity of diamonds was found. Before that they had indeed been rare inthe sense that comparatively few had been mined and brought to market, mostlyfrom India and Brazil. According to the records of the British East IndiaCompany, Jewish (Khazar/Sumerian) traders controlled virtually the entire worlddiamond traffic by the end of the eighteenth century, but the Brazilian fieldswere almost depleted of diamonds and no more were coming out of India. The findat Kimberley changed all that and the infamous and utterly ruthless Rothschildagent, Cecil Rhodes, seized the opportunity. Rhodes was a Reptilian hybridaristocrat, a confidant of Queen Victoria and Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm, and acolleague of bloodline British prime ministers, Lord Salisbury and LordRosebery, who was related to the Rothschilds. Rhodes was also the first head ofthe Round Table and deeply involved in other secret societies. Shortly afterarriving at Oxford University in the early 1870s, Rhodes was initiated intoFreemasonry at the Apollo [Sun god] University lodge No. 357 and at Oxford healso joined a Scottish Rite Lodge called Prince Rose Croix Lodge No. 30. TheRose Cross is connected with the Rosicrucian Order, another Illuminati secretsociety. Rhodes was a big-time insider.After the diamond find at Kimberley, Rhodes paid £6,000 (secured from NathanielRothschild) to a farmer called De Beer for his diamond-rich land and he setabout bringing together all claim holders in the area into his company, which hecalled De Beers Consolidated Mines, formed in 1888. It was nothing short of adiamond cartel and to protect and expand its power, and secure control of goldmining, Rhodes and the British Empire went to war with the Dutch-descendedsettlers in South Africa known as the Boers, a word meaning farmers. They areknown today as Afrikaners and they controlled the South African government inthe apartheid era in league with the Oppenheimer family. The farmer called DeBeer who sold his land to Rhodes was a Boer. The British had already forced themout of the Cape and other settlements, and forced them into a long anddevastating trek northwards where the Boers established the Orange Free Stateand the Transvaal in the lands of the native peoples. Cecil Rhodes becamepremier of the British Cape Colony, and his later successor as head of the RoundTable, the Rothschild banker, Alfred Milner, became High Commissioner for SouthAfrica in 1897. Same names everywhere you look. They wanted to gain control ofthe Boer states, not least because of gold reserves, and the two ‘Boer Wars’were fought and won between 1880 and 1902. The latter was the year that Rhodesdied, aged 48, from a ‘heart problem’, probably connected to the fact that hedidn’t have one. The assault on the Boers was typical of the barbarism employedby the Reptilian hybrids as farmsteads and villages were burned, all cropsdestroyed and livestock slaughtered to batter them into submission. The Zulu Warwas also fought in 1879 to bring an end to the Zulus as an independent nation,and Rhodes was at the forefront of causing inter-tribal conflicts that led toboth sides being absorbed into the British Empire. What followed was the Unionof South Africa under British control and the diamond and gold industries werein the hands of the Rothschilds and their associates. Historian Mark Weberwrote:> Rhodes waged war against any and all who got in his way of consolidating the> diamond mines. Supported by the British government, which agreed to his Anglo-> American vision, Rhodes waged a financial war against competitors Barney> Barnato and the Standard Company, and Baring Gould and the Central Company.> Rhodes said of the Central Company, ‘We must have the four mines and I will> allow no foreign vulture to step in at the end and form a separate mine on the> Stock Exchange apart from us to get a flotation on our name’. His method was> to swallow up poorer ones and buy out richer ones. This is text-book modus-operandi of the Reptilian hybrids. In 1914, some twelveyears after Rhodes died, along came a German-born diamond dealer called ErnestOppenheimer, who discovered enormous quantities of diamonds in what was thencalled German South West Africa, now Namibia. It was the biggest diamond mine inhistory at that time and so abundant that black people were deployed with a tincan around their necks to go around on hands and knees and pick them up.Oppenheimer secured control of the land, but his report on the find was kepthidden from the public to keep secret the number of diamonds available. Hecalled his company the Anglo American Corporation to acknowledge his investorsin England (primarily the Rothschilds) and in America (the J.P. Morgan operationcontrolled by the Rothschilds). The Oppenheimers and the Rothschilds are bothGerman Khazar/Sumerian banking families and closely connected. In the 1920s,Ernest Oppenheimer, supported by the Rothschilds, made his move on De Beers. Hetold them that if they did not make him chairman of the company he would floodthe market with diamonds and crash the price. He became chairman in 1929 and thetakeover of the global diamond trade was complete. It wasn’t even truly a cartelgiven that it was controlled by one family, the Oppenheimers, fronting foranother, the Rothschilds. De Beers was owned by Anglo American and, throughcreative bookkeeping and management, Anglo American was owned by De Beers in themould of Reptilian hybrid control worldwide. It was no surprise when I receivedthis from a reader with reference to my book, The Biggest Secret:> I was born in South Africa and years ago got to know an old lady in> Johannesburg who had for many years been the lover of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer.> She told me that Ernest used to visit her in the afternoons at her flat in> Parktown. On one occasion when they were about to make love, his body took on> the form and proportions of a giant lizard with scales and she said the> experience had been one of the sexual highlights of her life. The story, which> was so strange at the time, has been in the back of mind for years and came> back to me when I recently read your book. Pure evilWith the discovery of diamonds and gold in South Africa, the Rhodes–Oppenheimer–Rothschild operation needed miners to work for a pittance. With the potentialworkforce living off the land and not interested in mining, they needed to forcethem into working for them. One way was to introduce taxes for anything theycould think of – a poll tax, hut tax, even a dog tax – and because they lived acashless life of self-sufficiency, the people could not pay these taxes. Thisforced the men to leave their families to walk hundreds of miles to work in themines in horrendous conditions and sign contracts that could not be broken. Aformer De Beers employee called Gordon Brown described the scene:> When I arrived in the mine in 1968, I was quite appalled by the conditions for> the migrant labourers. The working hours were long. It was a 60-hour week. The> conditions under which they worked – they were out in the open, very little> protection against the cold and the wind. They weren’t given much to eat. They> were given half a loaf of brown bread and a flask of cold tea to last them> throughout that 10-hour shift. Conditions in the hostels were not much better.> There were no decent dining facilities. They had to eat in their rooms out of> aluminium buckets. There was no real privacy. The hostels themselves were not> very nice places to be in – single-sex hostels, 20 people to a room, in some> instances. The Reptilian hybrids see humans in the way that most humans see cattle. Theyare only low-caste slaves to be exploited and serve their interests. TheOppenheimers and Rothschilds still had one major problem to overcome with theirdiamonds, however. Diamonds by this time were certainly not rare, and so DeBeers had to persuade the public that they were to justify the prices beingcharged. Massive marketing campaigns over many decades have sold the myth thatdiamonds are rare, but this is a lie. Diamonds are crystals of carbon and theycan be found in great quantities all over the world. They are produced by heatand pressure some 1,200 miles below ground and they have been brought to thesurface by volcanoes to be mined, most famously in Africa. But, they are foundin extinct volcanoes throughout Asia, America, Russia and Australia, and alongriverbeds and shorelines can be found the ‘alluvial diamonds’, as they arecalled. Everywhere there is carbon there are diamonds. The number one fact toknow about them is that they are not rare and should be a fraction of the costthat people and industry pay for them. They are expensive, not because they arerare, but because one family, controlled by another family, manipulates themarket on a scale, and through methods, that beggar belief. Well, unless youunderstand the mentality of those involved, that is. Then it’s not even asurprise. As Edward Epstein, author of The Rise and Fall of Diamonds, said:> What I learned was that the diamond business wasn’t a business of extracting,> as I originally expected, something of enormous value and then simply seeing> how much of this object you could get out of the ground and selling it. That> was what the business appeared to be when I started my venture. > But their real business was restricting what came out of the ground,> restricting what was discovered, restricting what got cut, restricting what> actually found its way into the retail market and, at the same time, through> movies, through advertising, through Hollywood, through the manipulation of> perceptions, creating the idea that there was this enormous demand for these> shiny little objects that they seemed to have in abundant supply. > So I wound up on this voyage of discovery starting off with the idea that> there was this object of great value, and it was just a question of how many> could you get out, and I wound up discovering it was just the opposite. With diamonds so common throughout the world, the entire trade is based onconvincing people they are not common. To do this has involved indoctrination ofthe public, especially through television and Hollywood, and ensuring that thenumber of diamonds cut and available for sale is strictly limited. Marketingconsultant Herbert Chao Gunther said:> Nobody’s aware that diamonds and all the associations we have with diamonds is> a product of a marketing strategy. It’s completely invisible, transparent. If> you measure it in terms of how all the myths associated with this advertising> campaign have been deeply inculcated in people – it’s reached deeply into the> popular imagination – this is probably the most successful campaign in> history. The Oppenheimers opened a Hollywood office that gave diamonds to film producerswho would promote them in their movies. The aim was to associate diamonds as atoken of true love and something that is given by the man as a surprise (so thewoman is not in on the decision and can’t choose something else). Movie starsClaudette Colbert and Merle Oberon were given special scenes to show off theirDe Beers diamonds, and the film Diamonds Are Dangerous was retitled Adventure inDiamonds to suit the De Beers campaign. The song Diamonds Are a Girl’s BestFriend, performed by Marilyn Monroe in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,has been listed as the twelfth most important movie song of all time. JaneRussell sang it in the same film and it has been endlessly performed by otherssince, including Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge in 2001. The Oppenheimers came toan arrangement with the British Royal Family to wear their diamonds at theexpense of other gems, and the whole marketing campaign peddled the blatantuntruth that diamonds were rare, exclusive and thus had to be expensive. Giftsto the already filthy-rich Windsors included caskets embossed with coronets thatcontained a six-carat stone for Princess Elizabeth, now Queen Elizabeth II, anda four-and-a-half-carat diamond for Princess Margaret. All that wealth andthey’re still on the take. Another De Beers marketing strategy was to say ‘adiamond is forever’ and should not be resold. This was designed to suppress themarket in second hand diamonds to protect the price of the new ones. These guysdon’t miss a trick.Corporate terrorismSelling the lie to the public is only one part of the Oppenheimer/De Beersstrategy. They also have to stop the market being flooded with all the diamondsthat really exist, in fact and potentially. They have achieved this, as usual,coldly and ruthlessly. Fewer than 200 merchants are allowed to buy from DeBeers. These are the so-called ‘sightholders’ who can hold and see the roughdiamonds that De Beers is prepared to market from its headquarters at 17Charterhouse Street in East London. Everyone else must buy from thesightholders. Through this system, De Beers controls how many diamonds arereleased for sale and this is vital to stop their scam collapsing. Theydistribute to the cutters what is in short supply on the market and horde whatis abundant, a technique that fixes the price through supply and demand andkeeps it artificially high. ‘Capitalism’ is supposed to live by the law ofsupply and demand, but, once you artificially control those two forces, itbecomes cartelism – which is what the world economic system really is. Thesightholders can make requests for what they want, but De Beers decides if theyget it. One sightholder, William Goldberg, said: ‘I’ve been very angry andcussed a lot and been very upset, but that’s how the cookie crumbles. I have nooptions ...’ The Oppenheimers are constantly targeting new supplies of diamondsthat they don’t control and, big or small, their owners are bought out orthreatened with consequences. Fouad Kamil, a former ‘diamond detective’ with theAnglo American Corporation/De Beers, said that competition did not suit hisformer employers. ‘They wanted the whole plate for themselves’, he said, andthis involved violence and intimidation against those operating outside thecartel:> Diamonds going out of Sierra Leone and other African diamond markets were> going to what Anglo American described as black markets, that is, Antwerp,> Amsterdam, Germany, some parts of the United States and Israel. Now, these> people were labelled black markets by Anglo American, but in their own> countries they were respectable diamond dealers. > … those that had diamonds, I took them as prisoners. I interrogated them, got> the information from them. I kept them as long as I wanted, week to week, some> of them months, and released them when I wanted. There was beatings. There was> punishments without food. We did everything we could to extort the information> from them. There was a stage when no one dared to pass from there, diamonds or> no diamonds. So to put it bluntly, we were a terrorist group. That’s what it> amounts to. That’s what the Illuminati are – a global terrorist group. Where ‘alluvialdiamonds’ were being found washed up on riverbanks, De Beers sent out Oxfordgraduates into the jungle to buy them in the local currency, anything to stopthem getting on the market. The Oppenheimers also secured their monopoly bydoing deals with the colonial powers in Africa and, after ‘independence’, withthe corrupt black leaders installed by the colonial powers. Those who werecritical of the foreign-owned mining system, like the Congo’s firstdemocratically elected leader, Patrice Lumumba, ended up dead in a coup backedby the CIA. The intelligence agency network connects with the transnationalcorporations like Anglo American and De Beers through the bloodline secretsociety web. Other African leaders, such as Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator whenthe Congo became Zaire, accrued immense riches after selling out his people toDe Beers. A deal was struck by a De Beers middleman, an American called MauriceTempelsman, as revealed in declassified documents from the US State Department.Tempelsman met with the State Department, the US Embassy in Kinshasa, Mobutu andDe Beers and what emerged was an exclusive contract for all Zaire’s diamonds tobe shipped to De Beers in London. At least most of the coups, wars and slaughterin Africa have been manipulated by the Reptilian hybrid cartels to direct powerand events for their own benefit and there is an endless supply of ‘Mobutus’ tohelp them in return for a substantial commission. On one occasion the secretaryof Mobutu’s wife was found at an airport to be carrying diamonds worth $6million. Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe is blatant confirmation today of the depth ofsickness available for exploitation by these global corporations. EdwardEpstein, author of The Rise and Fall of Diamonds, said of De Beers:> Each time diamonds are found in an inconvenient place, they begin, the diamond> cartel, through intermediaries, through law firms they hire, ways to think,> how can we prevent these diamonds from reaching the market? And declaring> something a national park, tying things up in litigation – these are just the> methods and there’s an infinite number of different methods you could use,> once you understand what the objective is. The objective is to prevent mines> from being developed that are outside their control. All the elements of what you have just read about the creation and manipulationof the diamond cartel can be found with all the cartels controlling oil,finance, food, gold and other metals and resources, industrial production,drugs, construction, media, weapons manufacturing and all the rest, which, atthe highest level, become one cartel controlled by the elite Reptilian hybridfamilies. The same people involved with diamonds, Rhodes, the Oppenheimers andRothschilds, did the same with gold and the daily price of gold was decided atthe London offices of N.M. Rothschild from 1919 until 2004. Even then, only thelocation of gold price fixing changed, not the source.They are what you eat – and drinkToday, the Reptilian hybrids are working to control the supply and cost of waterand food on a global scale. People talk about controlling oil to control thepeople, but nothing, apart from air, is more fundamental to human survival, letalone health and prosperity, than food and water. If anything should be exemptfrom the profit motive it should be water, which is a most basic requirement forlife in this reality; but our water supplies are in the hands of the same forcethat now controls food production and sale across the world. This was allplanned a long time ago and to achieve this control they had to eliminatediversity by making life impossible for small and independent farmers. Thenumber going bankrupt, or selling up and leaving the land, has soared since theIlluminati war on the small farmer began worldwide. The Italian dictator, BenitoMussolini, is alleged to have said: ‘Fascism should more properly be calledcorporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power’. Whether hesaid it or not, the statement remains true in ‘democracies’ as much as infascist Italy, or Hitler’s Germany. We can see the gathering global fascism inthe merger of state and corporate power – with the corporate far more powerfulthan the political. This interconnecting web has allowed the corporations tointegrate their ambitions and manipulations into political policy and never morepowerfully than in the hijacking of the food chain.A prime example was the sting played on European farmers in the 1980s under theEuropean Community’s Common Agricultural Policy, or CAP. At first, this appearedto be the equivalent of winning the lottery for farmers of all kinds. Basically,they were paid for whatever they produced whether they sold it or not. Imaginethat. Whatever you produce you are guaranteed the market rate courtesy of theEuropean taxpayer. I remember as a Green Party spokesman arguing against theinfamous CAP and facing the wrath of the farming community who were lightingcigars and raising a glass to the genie and his magic lamp. Still, why wouldn’tthey, given the short-term thinking that infests the human psyche? All theirdreams had come true. The policy of we’ll-buy-whatever-you-sow led to massivesurpluses and the ‘food mountains’ and ‘wine lakes’, as the unsold productionwas stored in giant warehouses across the continent. This was one of thegrotesque examples of the rich–poor divide highlighted by Bob Geldof at the timeof Live Aid in 1985. While extraordinary amounts of food were being stored inEurope, millions were dying from starvation, but the Reptilian hybrids arenothing if not inhuman, figuratively and literally. They have no empathy, sothey don’t care. The CAP also devastated the countryside, and the land and soilin general, as farmers cleared all impediments to opening every square inch theycould for more production. Every sow was guaranteed dough, and this was withoutthe need even to find a buyer or a belly. They were also taking out big bankloans to buy more land at the ever-increasing prices, fuelled by what washappening. Trees and hedgerows were uprooted and wildlife plummeted with theloss of habitat and through the poisons provided by the pharmaceutical cartel toincrease yields in the short term, while destroying fertility in the long.Talking to farmers about the insanity of this as a Green Party spokesman was,appropriately, the story of the seeds and the stony ground.Then came the sting.Opposition to the Common Agricultural Policy increased until it was the majorissue of the day with the European taxpayer footing the astonishing bill. What’smore, the Reptilian hybrid network behind the policy was supporting and givingpublicity to this public outrage – ‘something must be done’. Stage two wasunderway. The European Economic Community, now called the European Union,announced that it would have to change the CAP in the face of public demand andthe ‘mountains’ of food left unconsumed. This policy revision was to stop payingfarmers for everything they produced. The gravy train had collided with thecombine harvester. Farmers across Europe were now faced with actually findingbuyers for their produce, but once the subsidies evaporated prices slumped withso much food and drink available, both in production and storage. Small andindependent farmers went bankrupt on a massive scale when they couldn’t paytheir debts to the banks that they increased dramatically through land-buyingand other investment in the manufactured boom. Who was waiting to buy the farmsat a few cents on the dollar? The corporations who were behind the whole sting,via the Reptilian hybrid network in government. In the United States, somethingsimilar has happened since the 1950s with a series of decisions by theRothschild-controlled Federal Reserve leading farm debt to explode. By the endof 2005, it was well in excess of $200 billion, and today in the United States,once a nation of small farmers, only two per cent of the population areinvolved. Illuminati corporations, not least Monsanto in Missouri and theprice-fixing Archer Daniels Midland in Illinois, have been major beneficiariesof other people’s misery. This has happened on every continent as the market hasbeen artificially suppressed in readiness for the ‘buy outs’. Where this has notyet happened, the corporations control the food chain by owning the seeds,setting the prices and imposing ‘free trade’.We own you – literallyPatenting seeds was unthinkable before the 20th century and indeed Article Oneof the US Constitution specifically excluded, for moral reasons, the patentingof ‘life’. In the 1930s, plant breeders were allowed to patent seed varieties,but not to have rights to subsequent seeds that were produced from them by thegrowers. Then in 1980, the Illuminati challenged these restrictions through theGeneral Electric Corporation and specifically one of its employees, anIndian-born scientist called Dr Ananda Chakrabarty. He developed agenetically-engineered microbe to ‘eat’ oil slicks, which in the end provedunusable. It was refused a patent by the US Patent Office, but Chakrabarty madehistory when the US Supreme Court awarded him, by just one vote, the firstpatent for a life form. With that judgement, the floodgates did swing. Duringthe Reagan–Bush years patents followed for animals, human genes and body parts.The corporations contend that if they own the gene in the animal or plant, theyown the animal and plant. So what about the genetic engineering of the humanbody? Yep, according to this contention they would say that they therefore ownthe body. As Andrew Kimbrell, Executive Director of the Center for Food Safety,said: ‘It actually means giving corporations, incredibly, the power to own andcontrol species of the Earth’. But look at who is behind all this – theReptilian hybrids on behalf of the Reptilian Anunnaki genetic engineers – and itmakes perfect sense. These laws mean that if you own animals or seeds that havebeen patented by the corporations you have to pay a royalty for every new oneproduced. This includes the poorest farmers of the ‘developing world’.From the mid-1990s, the Reptilian hybrid pesticide and chemical producers,notably Monsanto and Dow, began to buy the seed producers. Monsanto spent some$8 billion alone and Dr Charles M. Benbrook, former Board of AgricultureDirector at the Academy of Sciences, said: ‘Basically, the US pesticide industrybought the seed industry for all intents and purposes’. The intent and purposewas to control food production. The law was changed still further to, wait forthis, allow the corporations to patent seed varieties that they have notgenetically engineered. The only criteria were that no one else had got therefirst. This led to the corporations taking the seeds from the seed banksdesigned to protect genetic diversity, and going to the patent office toregister ownership. It is reckoned that Monsanto alone owns more than 11,000seeds – and rising. It has reached such ludicrous and outrageous levels thatwhen non-GM farms are contaminated by genetically-modified seeds blown fromelsewhere, even a passing truck, the corporations are taking the farmers tocourt for illegal use of their patented seed without a license. This ishappening to increasing numbers of farmers, including Percy Schmeiser in Canada,who was well-known for developing his own seeds. Monsanto went onto his landwithout his knowledge or permission and then issued a lawsuit for his use of itspatented and genetically-modified canola seeds that had blown onto his land. Itdidn’t matter how unjust and crazy it was, the court gave judgement in favour ofMonsanto. Why? Because the corporations, through the Illuminati secret societynetwork, control the courts, as they control the politicians who allowed allthis to happen in the first place. Percy Schmeiser was forced to destroy athousand pounds of seeds that he and his wife had developed over decades,because they had been contaminated by the unwanted Monsanto variety. Percy’swife, Louise, said:> Monsanto comes along when we have worked for all these years and they just> want to take it away just like that ... they can just come and do anything to> the farmers, just like they own them, and it really is upsetting. And I feel> they have taken our rights away and our privacy. And we are not the only ones> they have done it to, there are many others. > Why are they prosecuting so many of these little farmers when they are only> worth a couple a hundred thousand, when they are such a multi-national company> – why? Is it greed or is it that they just want to control all the seeds? The answer is both. It is another front in the war against the independentproducer and seed diversity – all diversity. The Schmeisers lost all theirretirement money in legal costs fighting the case and thousands of innocentfarmers just pay up when Monsanto come calling to avoid crippling lawsuits.Rodney Nelson, a farmer in North Dakota, was another Monsanto victim. He saidthat every farmer he had spoken to who had been targeted by Monsanto had toldthe same story. Monsanto had arrived to test their crop and those with nothingto hide thought little of it until a year later when, to their astonishment,Monsanto said they had found their patented seed variety on their land. Thedelay of a year meant the plants were not available for them to challenge theclaims. Monsanto told Nelson that they had tested all 1,350 acres of his Soyabean crop; but when it was pointed out in the subsequent legal case that to dothis would have meant gathering one sample continuously every 20 seconds, theychanged their story. They had, they said, only taken a handful. In short, theywere making it up, but, again, the Reptilian hybrids control the courts andRodney Nelson describes the judge’s ‘view’ of this incredible injustice:> It didn’t matter how Monsanto’s genetic-altered canola got into [the] field.> Whether it cross-pollinated or blew in by the wind, or by birds, insects or> animals or falling off a farmer’s truck, or carbine and so on, it didn’t> matter, if there were some plants there I had violated Monsanto’s patent, even> though I didn’t want it in my field. > He ruled that any farmer that has a conventional plant, it doesn’t matter what> kind of plant, if it’s a seed, a tree, if it gets cross-pollinated with> Monsanto’s gene against your wishes and against your property, my plant> becomes Monsanto’s property. Now stop and think what that means for farmers> all over the world, farmers, gardeners, anything to do with a life-giving> form. That shows you the power of patent law over farmers’ rights. One farmer suggested there was not a single field in western Canada that has notbeen contaminated by Monsanto’s genetically-modified (GM) canola and that’s thewhole idea. That was the reason for the ‘trials’ in the UK ordered by TonyBlair, the biotech industry’s man in Downing Street throughout his ten years asPrime Minister. Once these ‘trials’ are established, the contamination begins,followed by the lawsuit. One of the most active funders of GM research has beenthe Rockefeller Foundation, which will surprise no one who has read this far.Food controlThe most sinister development of all are the ‘terminator seeds’ that die after asingle use and cannot be re-used to produce seeds for the next year’s crops. TheUnited States government has been funding the research since the Reagan–Bushadministration in 1983, and, if you didn’t know the true motivation, it wouldseem inexplicable that a government would seek to develop a technology thatthreatened to turn farmers and whole nations into slaves of the seedcorporations. Willard Phelps, a spokesman for the US Department of Agriculture,said the aim was to establish the widest possible use of terminator seeds ‘toincrease the value of proprietary seed owned by US seed companies, and to openup new markets in Second and Third World countries’. Henry Kissinger’s words inthe 1970s capture the motivation: ‘Control the oil and you can control entirecontinents. Control food and you control people ...’ The ‘suicide seeds’ weredeveloped with taxpayer money in a joint operation between the United Statesgovernment and a company called Delta and Pine Land, which was reported to havehad a rather famous investor – Queen Elizabeth II. The largest shareholder hasbeen the Stephens Group in Arkansas, controlled by Jackson Stephens, the majorbankroller of Bill Clinton’s deeply corrupt political career. Now the punchline: In August 2006, it was announced that Delta and Pine had agreed a $1.5billion deal to sell its operation and terminator seed patents (developed withtaxpayer money) to … Monsanto.Running parallel with the creation of copyrighted seeds, has been the systematicdestruction of the alternatives. Ninety-seven per cent of the vegetables grownat the start of the 20th century are now extinct. There were once five thousandpotato varieties grown worldwide, now only four are grown on any scale. This isextremely important, because it opens the way for those varieties that remain tobe destroyed by disease or genetic manipulation. In Ireland in the 19th century,only a few varieties of potato were grown and the consequences of potato blightattacking those species were a million people starving to death. The fewervarieties we use, the greater the danger from disease and insects. This has ledto the dependence on chemical spraying – provided by Monsanto and co. – whichhas created the ‘super bugs’ and weeds that have developed, through mutation, animmunity to the poisons that killed them before. In my book, It Doesn’t Have ToBe Like This, published in 1989, I wrote that the chemicals were ... ‘creatingsuper-pests that have become resistant to the chemicals, so more and morepesticides are needed to kill them. Where will it all end?’ Today, we are seeingthe answer to that question. A report by the California Policy Seminar, a jointprogram of the university and state government, said:> As a result of these practices worldwide, the number of resistant pests is> growing exponentially, the authors point out. According to recent biological> research, the number of insects and mites that have become resistant to> chemicals since 1950 is up 10-fold, from less than 50 species to more than> 450. All these things are part of the Reptilian hybrid plan to control the globalfood chain and, through that, the people. Their ownership of the land and, bylawsuit, the independent farmers, means they control what, and how much, isproduced; by control of the supermarkets and the commodity markets, they dictatethe price it is sold for; and by enforcing ‘free trade’ laws through theIlluminati World Trade Organisation, they prevent any country from blockingimported produce to protect homes markets. All this has created:> •Dependency on Illuminati corporations for seeds.> •Dependency on Illuminati corporations for the pesticides, herbicides and> fertilisers to make the seeds survive and grow.> •Dependency on Illuminati supermarkets, which have destroyed independent> stores and dictate the price they pay to farmers.> •Dependency on Illuminati corporations for virtually everything that we eat or> drink.And dependency = control, which is what this whole story is about.To give you some idea of the ‘revolving door’ between government andcorporations, just look at the influence of Monsanto on the Boy Bushadministration, although you will find it with all US governments. As a Monsantoin-house newsletter said in 2000: ‘Agricultural biotechnology will find asupporter occupying the White House next year, regardless of which candidatewins the election in November’. Members of the Working Group on Bio-Safety makerecommendations on the use of genetically-modified food produced by Monsanto.The members have included: Linda J. Fisher, Vice-president of Government andPublic Affairs for Monsanto and formerly with the US Environmental ProtectionAgency; Dr Michael A. Friedman, Senior Vice-President for Clinical Affairs atG.D. Searle and Co., a pharmaceutical division of Monsanto, formerly with the USFood and Drug Administration; Marcia Hale, Director of International GovernmentAffairs for Monsanto, formerly assistant to the President of the United States;Michael (Mickey) Kantor, director of Monsanto, former Secretary of the USDepartment of Commerce; Josh King, director of global communication in theWashington DC office of Monsanto, former director of production for White Houseevents; William D. Ruckelshaus, director of Monsanto, former chief administratorof the United States Environmental Protection Agency; Michael Taylor, head ofthe Washington DC office of Monsanto, former legal advisor to the Food and DrugAdministration; Lidia Watrud, former microbial biotechnology researcher atMonsanto, who joined the United States Environmental Protection Agency’sEnvironmental Effects Laboratory; Jack Watson, staff lawyer with Monsanto inWashington, former chief of staff to the President of the United States, JimmyCarter. Others include representatives from Dupont (Illuminati bloodline) andDow Chemicals (Illuminati). Among them is Clayton K. Yeutter, former Secretaryof the US Department of Agriculture and former US Trade Representative, who ledthe US team negotiating the US-Canada ‘free trade’ Agreement and helped tolaunch the Uruguay Round of the GATT ‘Free Trade’ negotiations. He became adirector of Mycogen Corporation, whose majority owner is Dow Agro-Sciences, awholly-owned subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company. I am sure therecommendations of all these people has been devoid of any bias whatsoevertowards Monsanto, Dow or DuPont, or my name isn’t Donald Duck.Corporation of the people, by the people, for the peopleAnother Reptilian hybrid ‘modus’ is to present governments as freely-elected andanswerable to the people, when they are really privately-owned corporations. TheUnited States ‘government’ is actually the United States Corporation. It wascreated behind the screen of a ‘Federal Government’ when, after the manufactured‘victory’ in the American War of ‘Independence’, the British colonies exchangedovert dictatorship from London for the far more effective covert dictatorshipthat has been in place ever since. In effect, the Virginia Company, thecorporation headed by the British Crown that controlled the ‘former’ colonies,simply changed its name to the United States and other related pseudonyms. Theseinclude the US, USA, United States of America, Washington DC, District ofColumbia, Federal Government and ‘Feds’. The United States Corporation is basedin the District of Columbia (Semiramis) and the President of the Corporation isknown as the President of the United States. This is an accurate title giventhat one of the names for the Corporation is the ‘United States’. He or she isnot the President of the people or the country as they are led to believe –that’s just the smokescreen. This means that Bush launched a ‘war on terrorism’on behalf of a private Corporation to further the goals of that Corporation. Ithad nothing to do with ‘America’ or ‘Americans’, because these are verydifferent legal entities. It is the United States Corporation, not the‘government’, that owns the United States military and everything else thatcomes under the term ‘federal’. The privately-owned Corporation known as theUnited States is the holding company, if you like, and the fifty states are itssubsidiaries.You may notice that the national flag of the United States always has a goldfringe when displayed in a court or federal building, and you see this also infederally-funded schools and on the uniforms of US troops. Under theInternational Law of the Flags, a gold fringe indicates the jurisdiction ofcommercial law, also known as British Maritime Law, and, in the US, as theUniform Commercial Code, or UCC. The gold fringe is not part of the Americanflag known as the Stars and Stripes, but it is a legal symbol indicating thatthe court, government building, school or soldier is operating under BritishMaritime Law and the Uniform Commercial Code – military and merchant law, notcommon or constitutional law. Look at the flag behind US Presidents wheneverthey make a statement and you will see the gold fringe every time. Under theAdmiralty Law of Flags, the flag displayed gives notice of the law under whichthe ship (or a building or court) is regulated. Anyone entering that ship(building/court) accepts that by doing so they are submitting to the lawindicated by that flag. Judges refuse to replace the flag with one without afringe when asked by defendants who know the score because that changes the lawunder which the court is sitting. If you appear in a court with a gold-fringedflag your constitutional rights are suspended, and you are being tried underBritish Maritime (military/merchant) Law. If it seems strange that a court orbuilding on dry land could be administered under Maritime or Admiralty Law, lookat US Code, Title 18 B 7. It says that Admiralty Jurisdiction is applicable inthe following locations: (1) the high seas; (2) any American ship; (3) any landsreserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusiveor concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased or otherwise acquiredby the United States by consent of the legislature of the state. In other words,mainland America. All this is founded on Roman law, which goes back toBabylonian and Sumerian law, because the Illuminati have been playing this samegame throughout the centuries wherever they have gone. The major politiciansknow that this is how things are and so do the top government administrators,judges, lawyers and insider ‘journalists’.Americans think that their government and legal system is pegged in some way tothe Constitution, but it is not. The United States, like Britain and elsewhere,is ruled by commercial law to overcome the checks and balances of common law.It’s another monumental fraud. The US court system does not operate under theAmerican Constitution, but under corporate law. It is the law of contracts andyou have to make a contract with the Corporation for that law to legally applyto you. The scam has been set up so that when you register with the ‘FederalGovernment’ in any way, by accepting a Social Security number, driver’s licence,or any of the other official federal documents, you are, unknowingly,contracting to become an asset-employee of the United States Corporation. TheReptilian hybrids are extremely skilled in legalise and every word, or use oflower/upper case, is making a legal statement. Have you noticed that when youreceive correspondence relating to government, law and anything to do withfinance, including taxation, your name is always spelt in all upper case, as inBILL JONES? But your upper case name is not you. It is a corporation/trust setup by the ‘government’ Corporation through the treasury department at yourbirth. Every time a child is born a corporation/trust is created using his orher name in all upper case. So BILL JONES is what they call a ‘straw man’, acorporate, not human, entity. They do it this way because governments arecorporations and they operate under commercial law, the law of contracts. Thelaws passed by governments only apply to corporations and not to living,breathing, flesh and blood, sovereign, free men and women spelt in upper andlower case, or all lower case, as with Bill Jones, or bill jones. The living,breathing sovereign man and woman is subject to common law, not the commerciallaw introduced by governments through legislation.Using commercial law makes it much easier to install an ‘elected’ dictatorship.Unlike common law, you are not subject to precedents built up over centuries.You simply have to get a majority to vote for a bill in Parliament or Congress,or have the US President sign a document, and the law is imposed. What you alsohave to do – clearly not difficult – is to keep from the people the knowledgethat their name in all upper case is not them. They will then pay you taxes andbe subject to your jurisdiction and control in all areas of their lives, byunknowingly standing surety for the corporation – ‘BILL JONES’ – that they don’teven know exists. All court documents have the person’s name in all upper casebecause under the law of contracts the living, breathing being cannot be triedunder corporate law, only a corporate entity can. It is so crazy that Americanspay personal income tax to the government (corporation) via the Internal RevenueService (IRS) when the law to introduce personal income tax was never passed.Ask anyone from the US government or IRS to produce the law that says Americansmust pay income tax on their wages and they will not be able to do it. Many havetried and the law has never been revealed because it doesn’t exist. It’s all aconfidence trick and I explain more about this in some of my other books.Award-winning film producer, Aaron Russo, went in search of the income tax lawin his documentary, America: Freedom to Fascism, and interviewed IRSspokespeople and special agents, FBI officers, and tax attorneys. None of themcould produce the legislation and how could they when there isn’t any? A $50,000reward was offered by the We The People organisation to anyone who could producethe law and IRS agent, Sherry Jackson, thought it would be easy money. She thenfound out that there was no law and resigned to become a campaigner against thisfantastic hoax. She is not the only IRS agent to have done so. Yet, when peopledon’t pay taxes, which they do not legally have to pay, the IRS takes theirproperty, puts them in jail, and ever more often sends in the armed goons in theblack masks. It’s fascism, nothing less, but the Reptilian hybrids inventedfascism so they’re good at it. If anyone thinks that without personal income taxthere would be no education and other public services – it’s not true. They arepaid for by state and property taxes, business taxes, sales taxes, fuel tax,booze tax and all the other endless taxation that we pay besides income tax. Infact, personal income tax in the US is roughly the same as the money paid bygovernment to the banks in interest on loans.The Crown TempleIt is the same story in the United Kingdom. When the authorities talk of ‘TheCrown’, they are not referring to the King or Queen, but the symbolic CrownTemple of the Knights Templar in London’s Temple district that was featured inThe Da Vinci Code. The Temple grounds are also home to the Crown Offices atCrown Office Row. The Crown Temple controls the global ‘legal’ system, includingthose in the United States and Canada, through a network centred on the Inns ofCourt of the Crown Temple, based at Chancery Lane in London. The four Inns ofCourt are the Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Lincoln’s Inn and Gray’s Inn, andthey are nothing less than exclusive secret societies without charters orstatutes. They are a law unto themselves. The Inner Temple controls the legalsystem franchise for Canada and Britain while the Middle Temple does the samefor the United States. Queen Elizabeth II is a member of both Temples. All BarAssociations are franchises of the Crown and all Bar Attorneys throughout theworld pledge a solemn oath to the Temple, even though many may not be aware thatthis is what they are doing. Bar Association ‘licensed’ attorneys must sweartheir oath, pledge and terms of allegiance to the Crown Temple if they are to be‘called to the Bar’ and work in the ‘legal’ profession. The Crown Templecontrols not only law, but also ‘The City’, a privately-owned Corporation(sovereign state) consisting of 677 acres in the urban sprawl known as ‘GreaterLondon’. This is why there is a Lord Mayor of ‘the City’ and another mayor forthe rest of London. ‘The City’ has a resident population of 5,000, while GreaterLondon is home to eight million, but in that small area massive global power iswielded. More than 300,000 people are employed in financial services in, orconnected to, ‘the City’. London has nearly 500 foreign banks – more than anyother city in the world – and more funds are invested in the City of London thanin the ten leading European cities combined. ‘The Crown’ is actually a committeeof a dozen or so men representing the banks who rule the independent sovereignstate known as ‘The City’. The most powerful force, once again, is theRothschilds.The City is not a part of England, not subject to the sovereign, nor the rule ofParliament, and has its own police force. The sovereign state is run from theMansion House across the road from the Rothschild-controlled Bank of England bya Lord Mayor, a post that goes back to 1189. The Mayor is elected for one yearand is always a high Freemason. The City and the Temple are manipulated by amaze of secret societies, including, naturally, the Knights Templar. The sittingmonarch has to request permission from the Lord Mayor when she or he wishes toenter the City and the mayor meets the monarch at Temple Bar where the ‘City’meets the Temple district. Today, that spot is marked by a flying reptile andthe emblem of the City is two flying reptiles holding the red cross on the whitebackground, the emblem of the Knights Templar and other Reptilian hybrids goingeven further back. The British Prime Minister and his or her government aresubordinate to the ‘City’and they are all subordinate to the Roman Church, theChurch of Babylon, which is based in the Vatican City, another sovereign entitynot subject to parliamentary rule. London is, in fact, Babylon-don. Theblueprint of the sovereign state within a state was designed by the Roman Churchwith the Vatican City and has been repeated with its subordinate fiefdoms, theCity of London and Washington DC. Look at the American Constitution and you willfind mention of the Federal and the State levels of government, but not the‘District’, which is the legal status of Washington DC in the District ofColumbia. The ‘ruling’ British monarch is subordinate to the Crown Temple, and,therefore, the Roman Church which controls it.The United States is still owned by the ‘Crown’ and its ‘independence’ is asham. What irony that a Roman Catholic is barred from being the British monarchwhile all along the monarch and the ‘kingdom’ have been owned by the Church ofRome, but the ban is a great way to hide the truth. How many Americans wouldbegin to believe that their ‘free’ country is controlled from London and Rome?At least seven signatories to the American Declaration of Independence wereTemple Attorneys who had pledged allegiance to the Crown. One Middle Templeagent during the formation of the United States was Alexander Hamilton, whostructured the American banking system in line with the Rothschild/Crown Templeagenda for control of the new United ‘States’. A ‘State’ is a legal entity ofthe Crown – a Crown Colony. As Michael Edward points out in an excellentInternet study:> Americans were fooled into believing that the legal Crown Colonies comprising> New England were independent nation states, but they never were, nor are> today. They were and still are Colonies of the Crown Temple, through letters> patent and charters, who have no legal authority to be independent from the> Rule and Order of the Crown Temple. A legal State is a Crown Temple Colony. > Neither the American people nor the Queen of Britain own America. The Crown> Temple owns America through the deception of those who have sworn their> allegiance by oath to the Middle Templar Bar. The Crown Bankers and their> Middle Templar Attorneys rule America through unlawful contracts, unlawful> taxes, and contract documents of false equity through debt deceit, all> strictly enforced by their completely unlawful, but ‘legal’, Orders, Rules and> Codes of the Crown Temple Courts, our so-called ‘judiciary’ in America. This> is because the Crown Temple holds the land titles and estate deeds to all of> North America. How symbolic it is that copies of the American Constitution and the Declarationof Independence hang on the wall of the library of the Middle Temple in London.After all, they were the force behind both of them. While Middle Bar Templarswere orchestrating the illusion of freedom from the perceived rule by KingGeorge III, the king, too, was a sworn member of the same Middle Temple. MichaelEdward continues:> 1776 is the year that will truly live in infamy for all Americans. It is the> year that the Crown Colonies became legal Crown States. The Declaration of> Independence was a legal, not lawful, document. It was signed on both sides by> representatives of the Crown Temple. Legally, it announced the status quo of> the Crown Colonies to that of the new legal name called ‘States’ as direct> possessive estates of the Crown. > The American people were hoodwinked into thinking they were declaring lawful> independence from the Crown. Proof that the Colonies are still in Crown> possession is the use of the word ‘State’ to signify a ‘legal estate of> possession’. Had this been a document of and by the people, both the> Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution would have been written> using the word ‘states’ [lower case ‘s’]. By the use of ‘State’, the> significance of a government of estate possession was legally established. All> of the North American States are Crown Templar possessions through their legal> document, signed by their representation of both parties to the contract,> known as the Constitution of the United States of America. And Crown Templar possessions are the possessions of the Church of Rome, theChurch of Babylon, with its ‘Guardians of the Vatican Treasury’ – theRothschilds. It is worth noting that while the British monarch is not ‘theCrown’, she or he is a symbolic representative of its power, and British membersof parliament, judges, armed forces, intelligence agents, police officers andbishops all have to swear an oath, or make an affirmation, of allegiance to theQueen or they cannot be appointed – even Members of Parliament who have justbeen elected by the people. It is the same in many countries of the BritishCommonwealth, including Canada. British judges must say ‘I do swear by AlmightyGod that I will well and truly serve our sovereign lady, Queen Elizabeth II, inthe office of Her Majesty’s court … ’ Note that it is not the peoples’ court,but ‘Her Majesty’s court’. Even Bishops of the Church of England must say beforethey can be appointed: ‘I accept Your Majesty as the sole source ofecclesiastical, spiritual and temporal power’. Look at the language. They areactually telling us what the situation is. The Crown, symbolised here by themonarch to avoid the game being exposed, is ultimately in control of everything.The definition of sovereign is: ‘One that exercises supreme, permanentauthority, especially in a nation or other governmental unit’. What do they callthe Queen in the oaths? Sovereign Lady. The people of Britain and the countriesof the Commonwealth are described in law as ‘subjects’, the definition of whichis … ‘Being in a position, or in circumstances, that place one under the poweror authority of another or others’. The Queen talks of ‘my subjects’ and ‘mygovernment’, and she is head of the Church of England – ‘Defender of the Faith’– and Commander-in- Chief of the armed forces who swear allegiance to her. Weare given the impression today that the monarch (Crown) has little power, butthat’s nonsense. The Queen can by law:> •Choose the Prime Minister.> •Dismiss ministers and governments.> •Dissolve Parliament.> •Refuse to agree to legislation passed by Parliament.> •Dismiss the governments of other countries of which she is monarch.> •Pardon convicted criminals.> •Declare a state of emergency.> •Issue proclamations.> •Command the army and raise a personal militia.Those powers are, in truth, the powers of the Crown Temple, controlled by theRoman Church, because the British monarch is its vassal.Removing the problem …A common ‘modus’ of the Reptilian hybrids is to assassinate, discredit or causeto develop ‘bad health’, anyone getting in the way of their plans. This could bea president or other politician; a real journalist getting too close to thetruth; or whistleblowers in their various fields who can expose a lie orconspiracy. In short, anyone who they term a ‘problem’. The list of such peoplethroughout history could fill a library. Those removed by the Clinton and Bushfamilies alone would occupy a shelf or two. President Kennedy is the most famousof these targets, but there are so many more, including his brother BobbyKennedy, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X in the 1960s (see And The Truth ShallSet You Free for the background to what really happened). There was also theplane ‘crash’ arranged for JFK junior in 1999 as he apparently planned either torun for a Senate seat in New York, later won by Hillary Clinton, or against BoyBush for President. In an interview with American researcher Tom Flocco, aformer member of the CIA’s ‘Division 4’ said he had been part of a CIA teaminvestigating the death of JFK Jr. The operative used the fictitious name,‘Delbert’, and he said:> One of my family members was related to JFK Jr’s grandmother, and although it> was not a blood relationship, I had at least a half dozen lengthy> conversations with John during the years before he died. We liked each other> and hit it off; so this was why John opened up to me and seemed to trust me> regarding his future plans to run against either Hillary Clinton for the> Senate [in New York], or George W. Bush for the Presidency in 2000. John had> many conversations with my relative; and he gave her permission to discuss his> political aspirations with friends so this was not a closely held secret. But> what was interesting was that John told me he was pretty sure he could win> either of those races. ‘Delbert’ said he had thoroughly investigated the ‘crash’, which happened whenKennedy’s small plane fell into the Atlantic on July 16th 1999. It was on aflight from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, New Jersey, to Martha’s Vineyard,off the southern coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, where the Kennedy familyhas a holiday house. His wife and sister-in-law also died. Delbert said they hadinterviewed ten witnesses who said they saw the plane explode in flight. Twowitnesses said that two days before the ‘crash’ they had seen Father George Bushand his soon-to-be president son at Essex County Airport in New Jersey, whereJFK Jr. kept his plane. They were with two Mossad agents, one of whom was calledMichael Harari, the witnesses claimed. Delbert said that around the end of July1999, during the final phase of the investigation, his team talked to severalsources inside the White House. ‘We included their testimony in the final draftof the report, which was classified until 2025 and not currently available toany living individual’, the former CIA operative revealed. He said that becausethe report found concrete evidence of a plot involving three presidents and acurrent senator in the assassination of JFK Jr., it would probably never be seenby the American people, unless there were grand jury indictments and a publictrial. He went on:> The White House sources we interviewed overheard conversations involving> individuals who made the decision to murder JFK Jr. … The meeting to discuss> the murder occurred in the White House Oval Office. The subjects named in the> report who participated in ordering the murder of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Jr.> were President Clinton and his wife Hillary – both in the room; former> Attorney General Janet Reno – also in the room and who JFK Jr. had publicly> called to task for her role in Waco and Ruby Ridge [state murder] operation;> FBI Director Louis Freeh – in the room; and former President George H. W.> Bush, Laurance Rockefeller [now dead], and three Inner Circle Council of> Thirteen members who were all teleconferenced into the Oval Office discussion> via secure White House phone lines. [The Council of Thirteen is an elite> Reptilian hybrid grouping and note the number yet again – thirteen.] > We were told by the same White House sources we interviewed that FBI Director> Freeh left the Oval Office after the murder plot was discussed and met with> Israeli Mossad agent Michael Harari who then met with his supervisor, General> Rafael Eitan, considered to be one of the most dangerous Israeli agents who> ever lived. [Eitan died in 2004] Delbert explained that testimony by White House and airport witnesses providedevidence that three United States presidents have their own private Mossadassassins, together with others from American federal government agencies, andwould use them to commit treason and murder against anyone who poses a politicalthreat to their power. We are talking here about the two Bushes and BillClinton, but it will be the same with others. ‘I had heard that even our own FBIagents literally trembled at the fear of being assigned to watch General Eitan’smovements, since collaborating congressional oversight allowed him to freelyenter the United States at any time, using passports under a different name,’Delbert said. Mossad agent Michael Harari also comes up with regard to otherterrorism in the United States – see Alice in Wonderland and the World TradeCenter Disaster.Delbert said that his investigation established that JFK Jr.’s plane broke intwo ‘just aft of the cabin’ when a plastic shape-charge device exploded. It hadbeen positioned along the bottom of the fuselage and up along both sides of thewalls and set off by a large spark from a barometric switch device triggered togo off at a certain altitude. ‘In other words, the assassins chose the altitudefor the explosion of the plane – a standard procedure to make the target’smurder look like an accident’, Delbert said. Those new to this sort ofinformation will be shocked to think this could be happening, but behind thescenes it is commonplace. All major governments, and most of the others, operatein the same way, and we will see later that what Delbert said is supported byendless other evidence, especially with regard to the Bushes and Clintons.Delbert admitted that he had been a member of the US Army Special Forces,attached to something called Project Phoenix, with orders to ‘destabilizetargeted governments by murdering government officials, elites, professionals,bankers, military leaders, teachers, professors and medical professionals’. Thishad started in Vietnam and moved to Central America:> I was part of what we called the Bush–Clinton New World Order takeover to> place in power selected individuals who received their marching orders> directly from the US government. Plain and simple, Project Phoenix required> Americans to kill off innocent people to place in power those selected by the> US ruling elite; but I left, finding it very objectionable. > These activities are still going on today. America now uses FBI Division 5,> CIA Division 4, and elements from within the Department of Defense and Defense> Intelligence Agency, for its dirty work. Five-man Delta teams made up of> nationals from Mexico and Ecuador are being trained for house-to-house> extraction and murder of American citizens when the day comes that Martial Law> is declared and what little is left of our Constitution is scrapped. Plane crashes, especially of small aircraft, are a regular technique to removethose getting in the way, and they always have the National Transportation‘Safety’ Board to produce an official investigation that comes to the ‘right’conclusion. Another example is that of Senator Paul Wellstone, the Democrat fromMinnesota, in 2002. He was about to be re-elected to continue his campaignagainst the planned invasion of Iraq and other major Bush–Cheney plans. Theywanted him gone real bad and tried so hard to unseat him at the polls, but hewas just too popular. Shortly before the ‘crash’ Cheney had warned Wellstonethat bucking the Bush administration could result in severe consequences forboth him and the State of Minnesota. Wellstone bucked it anyway and soon he wasdead.Death in the woodsIn Britain, we have had many convenient deaths, including that of the weaponsexpert, Dr David Kelly, who had the knowledge to demolish the claims of Bush andBlair about the dangers from ‘weapons of mass destruction’ in Iraq, which Kellyhad visited as a weapons inspector. He was a renowned expert on these subjectswith long experience in other countries and this expertise had the potential toscupper the manufactured excuse used to justify the invasion of Iraq. Kelly hadalready told the London Observer off-the-record that what people like USSecretary of State and 33rd degree Freemason, Colin Powell, had claimed to beIraqi ‘mobile germ warfare laboratories’ were nothing of the kind. Kelly knewthis because he had inspected them as a member of the UN inspection team. Hethen met with Andrew Gilligan, a BBC defence correspondent, for anotheroff-the-record briefing on May 22nd 2003. As a result of their conversation,Gilligan reported that an informed source had told him that the Blair government‘dossier’ on the alleged danger from Iraq had been ‘sexed up’ to make SaddamHussein appear to be a bigger threat than the evidence warranted. This includedadding in a claim that Iraq could deploy battlefield chemical and biologicalweapons within forty-five minutes, even though they knew that was extremelydubious. Kelly had named the author of that claim to be Tony Blair’s chiefspinner, a vicious piece of work called Alastair Campbell. Blair and Campbelldid not need laxatives at this point and their response was their usual one –attack and discredit the source. They targeted Andrew Gilligan and then ‘outed’David Kelly, who faced a public grilling before two House of Commons committees.On July 17th, less than a month after meeting Gilligan, David Kelly went for awalk from his home in Oxfordshire and never returned. He was found in a secludedwood with his wrist cut and the official story was that he committed suicide andbled to death. The inference was that the pressure had made him do it. This isthe same David Kelly who faced the wrath of the Saddam regime as a weaponsinspector after the 1991 Gulf War, and coped with something similar from Russianofficials during an investigation there. This guy could stand his ground. Beforehe left on his ‘suicide walk’, he emailed associates with ‘combative’ commentsabout the pressure he was under from ‘many dark actors playing games’. He saidhe hoped it would all blow over and he could get back to Baghdad and get on withthe work that really mattered. When he left his home, his wife Janice wasunconcerned. Although she knew her fifty-nine-year-old husband was deeply upset,his mental state did not seem to be too down. Walking was a hobby and he oftendisappeared for up to two or three hours. Paul Weaver, a local farmer, greetedKelly as he strode through the fields close to his home and there was nothing tosuggest a suicidal man. ‘He smiled and said hello’, Weaver recalled. Kelly hadfamily matters to look forward to, including the marriage of one of hisdaughters. He was devoted to his wife and family and he did not show signs ofsomeone who was about to kill himself. He was found dead in an isolated woodwith his wrist slashed with a pen knife. There was no goodbye to his wife andfamily and there was a reason for that: He was murdered. The verdict of‘suicide’ would insult the intelligence of a baked bean. As always with thesestaged suicides (a common technique to cover up murder), the official story doesnot begin to stand up to even mild scrutiny. He was supposed to have diedthrough loss of blood after cutting his wrist, but two paramedics who attendedsaid there was only a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly’s body, and apatch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. Dave Bartlett and VanessaHunt said they would have expected to see several pints if he had died fromcutting an artery. Medical specialists wrote to a national newspaper to say thatthe official story of Kelly’s death made no medical sense and others have sincefollowed. They said that a transected ulnar artery could not have caused adegree of blood loss that would kill someone, particularly when outside in thecold – a fact supported by the paramedics. David Broucher, a British ambassador,told of a conversation he had with Dr Kelly at a meeting in Geneva in February2003, shortly before the invasion of Iraq. Broucher had asked Kelly what wouldhappen if the invasion went ahead and he had replied: ‘I will probably be founddead in the woods’.Covering their tracksAfter an assassination in the Reptilian modus operandi, comes the official‘inquiry’ or ‘investigation’. These are conducted by personnel appointed by thevery people responsible for what is being investigated. David Kelly’s death, andthe claims that the dossier about the threat from Saddam Hussein had been ‘sexedup’ by Blair and company, were the subject of an ‘inquiry’ by Lord Hutton, or‘Lord Whitewash’ as he became known. He was appointed by … Tony Blair. Now, whatdid Hutton decide? Oh, yes: Kelly’s death was suicide; Blair and Campbell didnothing wrong; and it was all the fault of the BBC. Wave that feather and Ishall fall. In the wake of Hutton’s ludicrous ‘findings’, BBC reporter AndrewGilligan lost his job, along with the BBC chairman and director-general. Thosetelling the truth took the rap for the professional liars, thanks to an inquirycontrolled by the professional liars. The guy who headed the intelligencecommittee that drew up the ‘dodgy dossier’ and told outrageous lies to justifythe war in Iraq, was John Scarlett. This is a man I know far more about than hewould like, including his connection to a well-known BBC news and politicalpresenter who was trained by British Intelligence. Scarlett was rewarded for hismendacity with the Saddam dossier by being made head of MI6. Lying can give youa great career.Other government-appointed ‘inquiries’ to cover up Illuminati assassinations andterrorism have included the Warren Commission on the assassination of PresidentKennedy; the 9/11 Commission that covered up government complicity in thoseattacks; and ‘Operation Paget’, which decided that Princess Diana’s death was anaccident and there was no cover-up. The British Royal Family was undoubtedlyinvolved in Diana’s death and I go into this in detail in The Biggest Secret. Inthe late 1980s, with her marriage nothing more than a public show, Diana washaving a relationship with her personal detective, Barry Mannakee, but he diedin a motorcycle ‘accident’ in 1988 – another state murder. By 1990, Diana washaving a relationship with Captain James Hewitt. One day she went rushing intothe healing centre in London of her friend, Christine Fitzgerald. Diana was in aterrible state and Christine told me what happened next:> She was crying hysterically and I said ‘What’s a matter?’ You know it was> dog’s died stuff, bottom lip out, full sob. She came galloping through the> door. I gave her Rescue Remedy, clutched her, hugged her, calmed her down, and> said now tell me what’s going on. ‘I can’t believe it, I can’t believe it,> they killed him’, she sobbed. I said: ‘Who did they kill?’ She told me about> her affair with the detective [Barry Mannakee] and how he was decapitated on a> motorbike and how she thought it was a terrible accident. But now she knows> the royal family killed him because Prince Charles’ senior detective had just> told her that if she didn’t cool it with Hewitt, the same would happen to him.> He told her she should not think that she was indispensable, either. In 1998, in the Independent Television documentary, Diana – Secrets of theCrash, James Hewitt says that he, too, had been warned to stop seeing Diana orthe consequences would not be pleasant. He said:> The telephone calls were anonymous, but left me in no doubt that they knew> what the situation was. They were threatening. They said it was not conducive> to my health to continue the relationship. He said that other warnings came from Diana’s personal police protectionofficers, the Royal Household, and a member of the Royal family, whom he wouldnot name:> The [member of the royal family] said your relationship is known about. It is> not supported. We cannot be responsible for your safety and security and> suggest that you curtail it forthwith. James Hewitt was further quoted in The Times of London about these threats andhis comments supported completely the story Diana had told Christine Fitzgerald.Hewitt said that the clearest warning came when he was told that he would sufferthe same fate as Barry Mannakee. The Royal Family are figureheads for theestablished order that includes those controlling the government, ‘lawenforcement’ and the intelligence networks. This is the cabal which, with othersin France, killed Diana. Yet Lord Stevens tells us in his official ‘inquiry’that there is no evidence that the Royal Family or intelligence agencies wereinvolved in her death. Of course they were, the Steven’s report is a farce andcomes from a long line of farces collectively known as ‘official inquiries’. Itis worth remembering when official investigations are announced that people donot instigate inquiries that could destroy them unless they know from the startthat they won’t.A couple of other things to mention with regard to tell-tale Reptilian behaviourand methods of operation. One is the obsession with ritual and limitlessacquisition. The daily rituals of state, religion and royalty are archetypalreptilian, and so, in daily life, is doing things in the same way, at the sametime, week after week. This comes from the reptilian brain, which doesn’t likeanything off-the-cuff, unpredictable or ‘maverick’. It wants predictable order,everything in its place. You can also see the reptilian traits in those whodesire wealth and power for its own sake. They might acquire more money thanthey could spend in a dozen lifetimes, but every day they are up before dawninsatiably pursuing more. According to a BBC report, the American businessmenBill Gates and Warren Buffet have more money than the poorest 30 per cent ofAmericans combined. Far more than enough is never enough to the Reptilian mindand the corporate world is full of such people. There is also the manipulationmethod that I call ‘defending the first domino’. You will see the Reptilianhybrids trying to crush people who are apparently little or no threat to them,because they know that if the first domino falls the others will follow. Forexample, if you allow vibrational healing to gain a foothold in the mainstream(first domino), the next question that comes is ‘why does it work?’ (seconddomino). This has the potential to open the door to the true nature of realityand so they defend the first domino to stop this sequence unfolding. They do itwith everything that they are desperate to suppress and this is why they appearto overreact to the most minor challenge to their secrecy and agenda. They knowwhere it could lead.There you have some of the major modus operandi of the Reptilian hybrids andbeing aware of them makes us so much harder to manipulate. If you are new tothis information, you’ll see these techniques clearly being used all the timefrom now on."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 10 Symbolic interlude > [The universe] cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become> familiar with the characters in which it is written.

Thisshould not be surprising when the reptilian brain communicates far morepowerfully through imagery than words.Throughout the ages, and still today, they have placed their symbols before us,but without the background knowledge they appear to have no meaning. Oh, butthey do. These symbols are a secret language, a signature, or calling card. Ihave already shown how the Statue of Liberty is really an ancient depiction ofQueen Semiramis holding the flame of Nimrod/Tammuz and how Sun god and Moongoddess symbolism can be seen in the Roman Church, Islam and religion ingeneral. But there are so many other examples. One of the symbols of Semiramisis the owl, as can be seen from an original Babylon depiction of their goddess(Figure 124). What are the statistical chances, therefore, of having the roadsystem around Capitol Hill (Figure 125, overleaf) constructed as an owl sittingon a pyramid? The owl is also the symbol of Bohemian Grove in northernCalifornia, where the Reptilian hybrids go to ‘play’ every summer, worship thegoddess of Babylon and take part in their bizarre rituals. Semiramis also standson top of the dome of the Capitol Building in the form of the goddess ‘Freedom’(Figure 126, overleaf).Image [../Images/00129.jpg]Figure 124: An original Babylonian terracotta relief depicting Ishtar (QueenSemiramis), the goddess of Babylon alongside her owls.

Pont de l’Alma means Bridge orPassage of the Moon Goddess, and people leave their tributes to Diana there nextto the flame of Nimrod. The flame is also at the top of the obelisk placed inDealey Plaza in Dallas by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry after PresidentKennedy was assassinated a few yards away (Figure 127), and the ‘eternal flame’was placed on Kennedy’s grave in Washington’s Arlington Cemetery (Figure 128).Dealey means ‘Goddess Line’, as in Dea (goddess) and ley (ley line). The suffix‘ley’ can be found in place names all over Britain for the same reason.Image [../Images/00137.jpg]Figure 132: … and all this mirrors the ancient depictions of the Sun on thecross within the circle divided into the astrological calendar Sun god symbolism is everywhere. The Sun symbol can be seen on the wall of theelite Freemasons lodge in Boston, Massachusetts (Figure 129). It’s also on theroad that encircles the Arc de Triomphe in the Illuminati stronghold of Paris(Figure 130). In the centre of the circle there is a cross and under the arch isan ‘eternal flame’ – Nimrod. If you look at the wide shot, you will see that the‘Sun circle’ connects into twelve roads (Figure 131). This is the way theancients portrayed the annual Sun cycle with the Zodiac circle and the Sun onthe cross (Figure 132). On a financial building in the City of London we can seethe symbol again with the black Sun in the centre (Figure 133, overleaf). Thisis part of the Illuminati language of reverse symbolism when they turneverything around to symbolise the negative and satanic (which includesreversing the American flag on US military uniforms). More Sun and circlesymbols are used in the logos of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, orNATO, and the CIA (Figures 134 and 135, overleaf). The same theme can be seen onthe cover of the magazine of the De Molay organisation named after Jacques deMolay, the martyred leader of the Knights Templar, which is displayed at theFreemasons lodge in Boston, Massachusetts. In the centre is Walt Disney, founderof the Reptilian hybrid front corporation, and around him are twelve cartooncharacters (Figure 136). The famous painting of the last supper by secretsociety initiate, Leonardo da Vinci, includes the same theme with ‘Jesus’depicted as the Sun and the twelve disciples arranged in groups of four (Figure137). Down the road from the White House in Washington is a large building thatlooks like something straight out of ancient Egypt with the Sphinx-type symbolsoutside. This is the ‘House of the Temple’, the supreme headquarters of the 33rddegree of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (Figure 138). Behind the pillars isthe rising Sun being ‘born again’ as Tammuz or Horus, and it can be found onFreemasonic buildings all over the world. The same image is depicted on GeorgeWashington’s Sun chair and above the door of 10 Downing Street in London (Figure139), as we saw in a previous chapter. It is repeated in the image of theAmerican television network, NBC (Figure 140), and by the symbol-ridden MormonChurch, together with reverse pentagrams – the classic symbol of Satanism(Figures 141 and 142). The centre of a pentagram is a pentagon, hence the shapeand name of the headquarters of the US military (Figure 143).Image [../Images/00138.jpg]Figure 133: The same Sun and Zodiac symbol can also be seen in the City ofLondon across from St Paul’s Cathedral Image [../Images/00139.jpg]Figure 134: The Sun and circle symbol of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,or NATO Image [../Images/00140.jpg]Figure 135: The Sun on the cross appears yet again in the logo of the CentralIntelligence Agency, or CIA Image [../Images/00141.jpg]Figure 136: Walt Disney encircled by twelve cartoon characters on the cover ofthe DeMolay magazine, named after the martyred Grand Master of the KnightsTemplar.

Westbrook Jr that goesinto this in detail. Westbrook picks out two reverse pentagrams in the streetplan, one pointing into Capitol Hill and the other into the White House (Figures144 and 145). The headquarters of the 33rd degree of Freemasonry is on 16thStreet that goes from the White House and through the centre of the pentagram.Distorting geometrical symbols is another way that Satanists portray thenegative, or disharmony. A hexagram, the symbol of the Rothschilds from whichtheir very name originates, is also in the Washington street design and connectsinto Capitol Hill (Figure146). Other streets are aligned with where the Sunrises and sets at the winter and summer solstice. This is how ancient stonecircles and other structures, like Newgrange in Ireland, were aligned. TheWashington Monument, the biggest stone obelisk in the world, represents ‘Baal’sshaft’ or ‘Baal’s organ of reproduction’ (Nimrod’s dick), and the Oval Office inthe White House symbolises the womb of the goddess, as do the domes of churchesand other buildings. The President works in the womb of the goddess and those onCapitol Hill also operate in the womb, or belly, of the goddess as we’ve seenwith the owl in the street plan picture. Another version of ‘Baal’s shaft’ canbe seen in Freemasonry’s monument to George Washington (Figure 147).Image [../Images/00149.jpg]Figure 144: The inverted and distorted pentagrams in the Washington streets.

The cornerstone ritual involvescorn, wine and oil and goes back to ancient sacrifices to appease the ‘gods’. Itturns out that cornerstone is really ‘corn-erstone’, which relates to thesymbolism of Baal/Nimrod as the ‘corn god’. The Hebrew word for corn is ‘dagan’,which later became the Phoenician ‘dagon’. This is the same name given to thefish god of Babylon – Baal/Nimrod. In the Old Testament we are told: ‘For shedid not know that it was I that gave her the corn, and the wine, and the oil …which they used for Baal’ (Hosea 2:8). The ‘Children of Israel’ are alsoreported to have offered corn, wine and oil to their god, Yahweh. Baal wasdepicted as a bearded man with strong features and this is an image you find allover Washington DC and other cities. The same face is portayed in a sculpturecalled ‘The Awakening’ at Hains Point in Washington emerging from the Underworldin line with the myths about Baal (Figure 149). Jesus is also referred to as the‘cornerstone’.Image [../Images/00153.jpg]Figure 148: George Washington in Freemasonic regalia performs the cornerstoneritual for the Capitol Building in 1793.

The same symbol appears on CredoMutwa’s Necklace of the Mysteries which is believed to be a thousand years oldand goes back 500 for sure. The All-Seeing-Eye is displayed on the Mormon Templein Salt Lake City and in the symbol of the MI5 wing of British Intelligence(Figure 151). The very building of MI6 on the banks of the Thames in London hasthe same feel of the pyramid with the capstone missing (Figure 152). The name‘Thames’, by the way, comes from Thamesis, the Celtic goddess of water, who wasSemiramis, the Babylonian goddess of water. When the river gets to Oxford, theIlluminati’s global ‘education’ centre, the name of the Thames changes to Isis –the Egyptian version of Semiramis. The street layout of Dealey Plaza, scene ofthe Kennedy assassination and site of the first Freemasonic temple in Dallas,looks like a pyramid with the capstone missing (Figure 153). It is alongside the‘Trinity’ River … Nimrod–Tammuz–Semiramis. The All-Seeing-Eye is the symbol ofthe American television network, Columbia (the dove/Semiramis) BroadcastingSystem, better known as CBS, and America Online (Figures 154 and 155). In 2002,the deeply sinister US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), theresearch and development arm of the Department of Defense, launched the‘Information Awareness Office’, a propaganda operation with the potential formass surveillance. It chose a familiar symbol – the Pyramid and All-Seeing Eye(Figure 156).There are so many I could point out, but if you are new to this you’ll be ableto see them all over the place now they have been brought from the subliminal(‘below threshold’) into conscious awareness. Transnational corporation logosare a rich source for the symbolism-watcher, as with the double cross of the oilgiant Exxon (Figure 157). It is the double cross, appropriately, of theReptilian hybrid House of Lorraine (Figure 158). The Freemason symbol with theolive branches can be seen in the United Nations symbol, which also includesthirty-three sections to mirror the degrees of the Scottish Rite (Figures 159).One other to mention is the very symbol from which the word ‘fascism’ derived.It comes from the fasces, a bundle of rods tied together with an axe head, whichwas used by emperors and other high officials and dictators in the Roman Empire(Figure 160). It symbolises individuality tied together (extinguished) and ruledby a dictatorship – the axe head. It would seem strange in the extreme to seethis very symbol of fascism on Capitol Hill, including the debating chamber, onthe Lincoln Memorial, on the state seal of Colorado and on the logo of theJesuit-controlled secret society, the Knights of Columbus (Figures 161 to 164).But it is far from strange when you know what the game is.Image [../Images/00162.jpg]Figure 157: The logo of the Exxon oil corporation is the double cross … Image [../Images/00163.jpg]Figure 158: … which is the symbol of the deeply Reptilian House of Lorraine Image [../Images/00164.jpg]Figure 159: The symbol of the United Nations in Freemasonic blue withthirty-three sections within the circle in line with the official degrees of theScottish Rite of Freemasonry.

Image [../Images/00169.jpg]Figure 164: Why is it on the logo of the Roman Catholic and Jesuit-controlledKnights of Columbus? ‘Bigger than you think …’We also have the symbolism of Nimrod aircraft and helicopters, etc., and whenthe veil lifts you realise just how much symbolism there is relating to reptiles(including reptilian gargoyles on churches, castles and stately homes), and theSun god and goddess. All this is not only there for show. These symbols vibratethe energy of what they symbolise, because they are ‘physical’ representationsof thought forms and they affect the energy field around them. They also ‘speak’to the subconscious mind. If they are placed on vortex points in the energy gridtheir effect is magnified. This ancient and secret society symbolism operates onmany levels and has different interpretations according to how far you haveadvanced in the secret society hierarchy. While at one level, Nimrod, Semiramisand Tammuz are worshipped as literal people, at higher levels they are symbolsof energetic states and geometrical principles. The ‘Trinity’ then becomes maleand female, god and goddess, combining to create a third force, the ‘son’. Theso-called ‘Federal Triangle’ in Washington DC, made up of the Capitol Building,Washington Monument and White House is claimed to have been aligned with threestars, Arcurtus, Spica and Regulus, which form a triangle that encompasses theconstellation of Virgo … the virgin (Figure 165). Author and researcher, DavidOvason, produces detailed background to this in his book, The SecretArchitecture of our Nation’s Capital. He writes that the Freemasonic laying ofthe cornerstones at the Capitol Building, White House and Washington Monumentwere all timed to coincide with the appearance of this ‘Virgo’ triangle. As theSun sets over Pennsylvania Avenue from the 10th to the 15th of August, the Virgoconstellation appears in the sky above the White House and the Federal Triangle,and the setting Sun appears precisely above the apex of a stone pyramid in theOld Post Office tower. They are manipulating energy and thegeometrical-mathematical Matrix in general, and it is happening on a much widerscale than most can imagine. Charles L. Westbrook Jr, author of The Talisman ofthe United States, received some anonymous correspondence after his book waspublished. It consisted of a map of the USA and a piece of paper on which werewritten the words: ‘It’s bigger than you think’. Lines drawn on the map revealedsimilar geometry to that in Washington, but over a far larger area across theUnited States.Image [../Images/00170.jpg]Figure 165: The ‘Federal Triangle’ that connects the Capitol Building with theWashington Monument and the White House. The longest side is Pennsylvania Avenuewhere you find the White House, FBI headquarters and the infamous Carlyle Groupso closely connected to Father George Bush. The angle of 19.5° comes up often inmy research and this has also been found in alignments between locations onMars. Remember, angle is of great significance in this holographic Matrix It certainly is ‘bigger than you think’. In every sense."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 11 Now that’s prophecy > The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words.> If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must> use the words. > Philip K. Dick It is some sixty years since George Orwell published his prophetic novel, 1984,and in the light of current events it is a perfect time to remind ourselves thatwe are indeed rapidly heading for the Orwellian nightmare described sobrilliantly in his book. If anyone wants to see the world the Reptilian hybridswant to impose, then just read 1984.The more people that realise this, the greater will be the challenge to thegathering control I have been exposing and warning about since the early 1990s.As Orwell wrote:‘If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face –forever’. This does not have to come to pass, but it will unless arses and seatspart company. It is already doing so – by the day. 1984, written in 1948, isdescribed as a political satire, but it’s not. It is a political prophecy andthere is no way that Orwell (Figure 166) could have been so accurate without adeep understanding of the way the world was going, even possibly insideknowledge of what was planned. Orwell had many contacts in political circles andmixed with the elite from his days at the exclusive Eton College, where royaltyis educated. It is far from impossible that he picked up the threads of what wasintended to be. Orwell also worked for the BBC when it was under the control ofthe Ministry of Information, a wonderful Orwellian title in itself for anorganisation created to communicate dis-information.Image [../Images/00171.jpg]Figure 166: George Orwell saw it coming Orwell (real name Eric Blair) described a global society of total control inwhich the people were not even allowed to have thoughts that disagreed with theauthorities. They were subject to the Thought Police who dealt with anyoneguilty of thought-crime. In the Orwellian world, the people were not allowed apersonal life and everything they did, or thought, was controlled. Thegovernment, or ‘Party’, was headed by ‘BB’, or Big Brother, who appeared onposters everywhere with the words: ‘Big Brother is watching you’. In the smokeand mirrors society that Orwell describes, Big Brother himself could have been amyth to hide the real controllers (see George Bush, Tony Blair and theirsuccessors, who are controlled by forces that the public have no idea exist).Orwell’s Big Brother may not even have existed, either, but the people were soldthe story of his battle to save them from the terrorist, Emmanuel Goldstein, thealleged prime threat to the ‘free’ world. Goldstein had been in league with BigBrother during the revolution, the story goes, but he was said to have become amajor part of the resistance Brotherhood (see al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden andwhoever the authorities blame next for their own terrorism). Orwell implies thatGoldstein, too, either does not exist, or was eliminated, but as long as thepeople believed in his existence and his complicity in terrorism they wouldsupport the actions taken by the government to protect them from his terror.Heard that somewhere before?Orwell describes the sequence of events that led to the creation of the BigBrother state. A revolution in the United Kingdom turned to civil war and, atthe same time, the Soviet Union embarked on a mass invasion of mainland Europe,overrunning the entire continent, apart from the British Isles and Iceland. AThird World War then broke out between the three emerging powers of Oceania(including Britain and led by what had previously been the United States);Eastasia (controlled by a revitalised China); and Eurasia (the expanded SovietUnion). During this struggle for total power hundreds of atomic bombs weredropped on Europe, western Russia and North America. I have been writing sincethe mid-1990s about a planned conflict with China to trigger the imposition of aworld government. This information has come to me from many sources over theyears, and look at the way the media is now full of stories about a‘revitalised’ China and its massive military and economic capability. The waythe world was separated into giant superstates is happening today with theEuropean Union, African Union, and the planned American Union and Pacific Union,as you will see later. The three superstates in 1984 eventually realised that acontinuous stalemate war (see ‘war on terrorism’) was far more effective thanvictory. The constant war kept the people focused and busy manufacturing weaponsand goods for the conflict.The standard of living was appalling because it was understood that a poor andneedy population was easier to control than a rich and abundant one. The threesuperpowers take over most of the world, but leave one region officially ‘free’so they have something to fight over. This ‘disputed zone’ includes the northernhalf of Africa, the Middle East, southern India and down towards Indonesia andnorthern Australia. The warring factions rarely fight in their own territory.Airstrip One (the official name for Britain) is apparently the target ofEurasian ‘rocket bombs’, but it is hinted that the Oceania government islaunching these attacks on its own land to convince Airstrip One’s urbanpopulations that they are under constant attack (once again see ‘war onterrorism’, 9/11 and the London bombings, etc.). By the year 1984, Airstrip Onebecomes a police state and a mere province of the enormous Oceania (see EuropeanUnion). The people are segregated into three classes – the Inner Party, OuterParty and Proles – who are controlled by four ministries housed in massivepyramid structures. The ministries are named in line with Orwell’s law oflanguage manipulation, which he called Newspeak. This demands that you calleverything the opposite of what it actually does. You can see this techniqueused throughout society today – remember the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace that was manipulating war? The Orwellian ministries are:> The Ministry of Peace: its job is to ensure continuous wars. > The Ministry of Plenty: this is responsible for controlling food and goods> through rationing. > The Ministry of Truth: this is in charge of propaganda to stop the people> knowing the truth. > The Ministry of Love: its role is surveillance, identification of> ‘dissidents’, and their arrest and torture in the infamous Room 101. This is> designed to make them love the government that controls them. Orwell’s novel features a character called Winston Smith, a member of the OuterParty, who lives in the ruins of London, the major city of Airstrip One(Britain). His parents died during the civil war and he is recruited by the‘Ingsoc’ (English socialism) movement. He is given a job with the Ministry ofTruth, which controls all media in the Oceania superstate. One of his roles isto rewrite historical records to comply with the Party’s version of whathappened. The idea was to make the ‘past’ conform to the political expediencynecessary to justify current actions. Winston wants to know real history andtries to uncover the forbidden truth. He also keeps an illegal diary of events.While at the Ministry of Truth, he meets Julia, a mechanic who maintains the‘novel-writing machines’, and they begin an illegal relationship. There was nopersonal freedom and that included relationships. Sex for pleasure wasdiscouraged and employed only for the procreation of new members of the Party.Artificial insemination was the preferred method. Sexual life was entirelyregulated by the two Newspeak words, sexcrime (sexual immorality) and goodsex(chastity). Sexcrime covered all sexual ‘misdeeds’, including fornication,adultery, homosexuality and heterosexual intercourse practised for its own sake.They were all punishable by death. The term, ‘sex crime’, is now in every dayuse, of course.Winston and Julia are forced to meet in the countryside away from thesurveillance cameras, and in a room above an antique shop. Winston begins toquestion the lies of Ingsoc and the Party structure, and the couple are targetedby the Thought Police and a member of the Inner Party called O’Brien, who posesas a contact from the Resistance. O’Brien gives him a copy of ‘the book’,allegedly written by ‘terrorist’ Emanuel Goldstein, with its exposure of Ingsoc.Winston and Julia are arrested by the Thought Police and taken for interrogationto the Ministry of Love, where dissidents are tortured and executed. During thetorture, O’Brien tells Winston that they are not interested in securing a falseconfession. Instead, the idea is to use torture and electroshock ‘therapy’ tochange the way he thinks and to ‘cure’ his hatred of the Party. Thisreprogramming is revealed to be successful in the final sentence of the Orwell’sbook with the words: ‘He loved Big Brother’. Winston also writes that 2 + 2 = 5as confirmation that he has lost control of his own mind. Interestingly, theyuse Winston’s fear of rats to destroy his feelings for Julia, and this is amajor technique used on children and adults in the government mind controlprojects that turn out millions of mind-slaves to serve the global agenda. Theyfind out what most terrifies the victim, often a small child, and make themexperience it. This could be a fear of spiders, snakes or, in Winston’s case,rats. This state of sheer terror is manipulated to rewire the mind and itsperceptions of reality.Programming the languageThe theme of 1984 is mass and individual mind control through fear and traumaand the manipulation of language. The latter is most obviously expressed todaythrough what is called ‘political correctness’ and ‘hate speech’, or ‘hatecrime’. These terms alone could have been invented by Orwell, who explained howvital language is to perception. Orwell coined the term, ‘Newspeak’, for theofficial language of Oceania and the number of words available was reduced everyyear – see political correctness, ‘hate speech’, and the mobile phone text‘language’, which are fulfilling precisely this role today. Newspeak was basedon the premise that the fewer words that are available, the less efficiently youcan articulate your views. But it went even further. In this reality, we alsothink in words and limiting the language available diminishes your ability toeven think freely. As one Internet article put it: ‘… Can we communicate theneed for freedom, or organise an uprising, if we do not have the words foreither?’ Newspeak was designed to eliminate all meaning from language, leavingonly blandness that says nothing (see most political speeches), and it replacedthe previous vibrant language known as ‘Oldspeak’. This is what is happeningtoday. The word free still existed in Newspeak, but could only be used instatements like ‘the dog is free from lice’ or ‘this field is free from weeds’.It could not be used in its old sense of ‘politically free’ or ‘intellectuallyfree’, since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed, even asconcepts, and were, therefore, nameless. All words relating to concepts ofliberty and equality were contained in the single word, Crimethink, while allwords relating to objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word,Oldthink. When Tony Blair came to power in the British Labour Party he denounced‘old Labour’ and renamed the party ‘New’ Labour. With that, all ‘old Labour’thinking and language were expunged from debate.Words that powerfully express the opposite meaning to those promoted in thepropaganda are eliminated in the world of 1984. The opposite of ‘good’ was‘bad’, so bad is replaced by ‘ungood’. Instead of meaningful words like ‘best’comes the term ‘doubleplusgood’. Very bad becomes ‘doubleplusungood’. We areseeing the ever-increasing introduction of such meaningless words into ourlanguage all the time to hide the reality of what is happening. One example ofhow words are used to obscure the truth is the way that ‘civilian casualties’ or‘dead people’ have become ‘collateral damage’. Labels are also applied todiscredit opponents by the implication behind the terms used to describe them.If you challenge the impositions of the authorities you are an ‘anti-governmentgroup’; If you suggest, indeed prove, that the government is lying you are a‘conspiracy theorist’. Here are some other examples of language manipulationbased on the Politically Incorrect Dictionary – see www.newspeakdictionary.com[http://www.newspeakdictionary.com]: > Affirmative Action> Implied: Action which is correct (‘Affirmative’ means correct, and ‘Action’ is> normally good as well).> Actual: Preferential treatment for a particular minority group. [Apartheid was> ‘affirmative action’ for the white minority.] > American interest> Implied: The interest of Americans.> Actual: The interest of American corporations. This term is used by> politicians who wish to start a war, without explaining the specific reasons> why they are doing it. > Department of Defense> Implied: Department concerned with the defence of America’s borders.> Actual: Department concerned with maintaining of American ‘principles’> [see ‘American interests’] around the world through acts of large-scale> terrorism. > Free elections> Implied: The masses are free to choose any person they wish to run their> government.> Actual: The masses are free to choose between the two candidates chosen for> them. > National security> Implied: The security of the nation.> Actual: The security of those in power to do what they like. > Progressive> Implied: One who wishes to move his country forward.> Actual: One who wishes to move his country toward state-socialism or fascism> (same thing, anyway). > Terrorist attack> Implied: When an evil group ruthlessly attacks peaceful people for no reason> whatsoever.> Actual: When we upset a group so much that they fight back as best they can> against our superior forces.

Communities are quaint little places where> everybody gets along – and wouldn’t it be nice if the world was like that?> Actual: Governments that don’t stand in the way of US interest. A desire to> turn the world into one community which can be centrally controlled.‘Change’ is another word spun by the Orwellians. This is generally used tosuggest that a particular idea is good because it is newer; but newer is notalways better. Nazism and communism were ‘change’. Tony Blair’s buzz words werealways ‘change’ and ‘reform’ and they are used in the context that ‘change’ and‘reform’ are, by definition, good, and what they replace is ‘bad’. Then thereare the new words, or Newspeak, and the re-definition of words to make peoplesound ‘bad’ for having legitimate, often caring, views. Those who oppose‘globalisation’ – the centralisation of global power and the criminal abuse ofpoor people and countries – are dubbed ‘anarchists’, or ‘anti-capitalistdemonstrators’, when what they are actually opposing is ‘cartelism’. Someone whothinks differently, or questions the fundamental nonsense of the way the worldis run, is called an ‘extremist’. If you resist injustice you are a ‘militant’.A ‘peacekeeper’ is someone who occupies another country, and the ‘peace process’is the means of placating an oppressed people in an effort to stop them opposingtheir oppression. It is a ‘road map’ with no destination, because where you wantto get is where you already are. ‘Western values’ are the values that must beimposed on the rest of the world when those ‘values’ are not even applied in the‘West’ (see ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’). 1984 is here. The Orwellian Big Brotherstate is with us now with an agenda to impose ever greater suppression andcontrol until the most extreme of the techniques Orwell described are in place.In the world of 1984, three Party slogans were displayed to indoctrinate thepeople. These were:> War is peace> Freedom is slavery> Ignorance is strengthBy no coincidence whatsoever, this is what we are being told endlessly today.These are expressions of Orwell’s doublethink when two apparently contradictorythoughts are both considered to be true. There are so many modern examples. Bushand Blair talked about ‘fighting for peace’ and going to war because they ‘wantpeace’. Any statement that includes support for ‘fighting’ or ‘war’ cannot beabout peace. It is about fighting and war. Boy Bush’s speechwriters had him sayafter 9/11:> See, we love – we love freedom. That’s what they didn’t understand. They hate> things; we love things. They act out of hatred; we don’t seek revenge, we seek> justice out of love. You need to tell your loved ones, the little ones in> particular, that when they hear the President talking about al-Qaeda, Iraq and> other places, I do so because I long for peace. I want to send the signal to> our enemy that you have aroused a compassionate and decent and mighty nation,> and we’re going to hunt you down. When it comes to Orwellian doublespeak or doublethink it doesn’t get much betterthan that. There is also no debate in Orwell’s nightmare society on the groundsthat the Party is never wrong – just as Bush and Blair have never been wrong, nomatter what the scale of evidence. As Orwell put it:> Since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the Party is not> infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in> the treatment of facts. The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak> words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an> opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in> contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal> willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But> it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know> that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This is what the Jesuits, and other groups and secret societies based on theJesuits, demand of their initiates. They must believe what their superiors tellthem to believe, no matter what the evidence to the contrary. Orwell adds:> Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink.> For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a> fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely,> with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. By employing doublethink, the Party was able not only to bomb its own people andtell them it was an attack by the enemy, the Party members (including thosefiring the weapons) were indoctrinated to believe that the bombs were launchedby the enemy. Orwell’s Big Brother society had another Newspeak word calledfacecrime, which was the indication that a person was guilty of thoughtcrime,based on their facial expression. We now have technology and surveillance beingintroduced to do just that – to study body language and facial expressions tospot would-be ‘terrorists’. There was also Orwell’s crimestop, which meant torid oneself of unwanted thoughts and thus prevent a thoughtcrime or crimethink.Orwell wrote:> The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented> itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. Crimestop, they called> it in Newspeak. He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented> himself with propositions – ‘the Party says the Earth is flat’, ‘the Party> says that ice is heavier than water’ – and trained himself in not seeing or> not understanding the arguments that contradicted them. This applies to anyone who voted for Bush or Blair or supported the invasion ofIraq. Orwell says that in the last part of the 20th century technology is drivenby two things – ‘war and the desire to determine against his will what anotherhuman being is thinking’. This is where we are today with technologicalinnovation that is also motivated by ever more sophisticated methods of controland surveillance. Orwell writes about the telescreens, an obligatory item inevery home which both transmits constant propaganda and has the means to filmand record all activity and conversation. This is the Orwellian vision oftelescreen surveillance and indoctrination:> The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston> made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,> moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal> plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard.

The propaganda part of the telescreen is already well established. We call ittelevision and it bombards the collective mind with the official version oflife, all day, every day. Fox News, CNN and the BBC are some of the most blatantexamples, but the entire mainstream media is pretty much the same. We may haveendless channels, but they are basically the same one, churning out the sameunquestioned official line. Nonsensical ‘explanations’ for events like 9/11become accepted ‘history’ purely through repetition on the telescreens and inthe newspapers (propaganda sheets), and by the suppression of investigation toestablish if the official version of events stands up to scrutiny. I have beensaying in my books all these years that the technology we are allowed to see islight years behind that which actually exists, and the scale of surveillance isalready far, far closer to that of Orwell’s telescreens than most people beginto realise. Even with the technology we know about, the reach of surveillance isnow incredible. Walk through a town or city in Britain today and you pass fromcamera to camera with pretty much your whole journey recorded. Go into mostshops and it’s the same, as it is when you take your own money from an ATM.Virtually everything you do in a town or city outside of your home is watchedand recorded. Next it will be inside your home, as Orwell envisaged. Indeed isit even ‘next’? They are now introducing vehicle technology that logs your everyjourney in detail, and microchips that can immobilise your engine at will viasatellite. In Britain, ‘speaking’ surveillance cameras are being introduced thatallow their operators to give orders to people in the street – just as Orwell’stelescreens could. Everything you do on your computer, where you surf, or whatyou communicate, is logged. It is the same with your phone calls. The laws thatallow this to be done legally increase by the month, all justified by the bogus‘war on terrorism’, which resulted from the bogus version of what happened onSeptember 11th. Orwell could hardly have described it all better and I will bedetailing just how far we have already come in a later chapter.Orwell talked of the ‘proles’, or ‘proletarians’, which made up around 85 percent of the population. They were the unthinking masses and the authoritieslooked upon them as cattle, just as they do today. They didn’t suffer the levelof surveillance of those considered intellectually dangerous, because theydidn’t question anything. They were given prolefeed, the brain-numbing‘entertainment’ and made-up ‘news’ for the masses that kept them dumbed down andincapable of free thought. Spot on again, it turns out. There was the unperson,someone removed from circulation and all files until he or she officially ceasedto exist (see Guantanamo Bay and those who have simply disappeared never to beseen again). To talk about an unperson was a thoughtcrime, just as to highlightthe suffering, indignity and injustice imposed upon the inmates of GuantanamoBay has been considered to be ‘supporting the terrorists’. Anything in anypublication that put the Orwellian government in a bad light was described inNewspeak as malreported or malquoted. Once again, the authorities were neverwrong. We are now seeing the Orwellian ‘anti-terrorism’ programmes beingintroduced to encourage and reward the public to spy on each other, and reporttheir neighbours, workmates, clients and fellow students to the authorities. Allthis is straight out of 1984.How Orwell could be so prophetic and accurate is less important than the factthat he was. If you want to see the future, unless we wake up fast, read thebook and there it is laid out before you. If that’s a world we don’t wish toexperience, then the time has come to ask ourselves: ‘What am I doing about it?’If the answer is ‘nothing’ there can be no complaints when you hear the door tofreedom slam behind you, and slam it will unless outrage becomes action verysoon."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 12 Neo-Nazicons > All the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes> invariably from people who are not fighting. > George Orwell The Reptilians and their hybrid computer programs have been working since theirreturn after the ‘Great Flood’ to give themselves dominion over the Earth andthe slave race they genetically manipulated. They have not had it all their ownway by any means, but their plans for the centralisation of global power havenow reached the point where they can make their final push to the Orwellianstate.Once you understand the background and goals of the global conspiracy, dailyevents take on a very different perspective and make far more sense. I waswatching a television news report at the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanonin 2006 that talked of the ‘foreign policy crisis’ faced by the Bushadministration. They listed all the ‘trouble-spots’ – Israel-Gaza,Israel-Lebanon, North Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, etc. – and claimed thatrarely had a US government faced so many major problems around the world. But itdepends on what you mean by ‘problems’. We are back to my point about‘coordinates’ here. If you don’t have the right coordinates you can’t possibly‘read’ what is happening. If you believe that the aim of American ‘foreignpolicy’ is to bring peace and freedom to the world (if that is your coordinate)then it does, indeed, seem like the United States is faced with enormouschallenges. If you know that the US government is merely a tool of theIlluminati, and the idea is to create as much war and suffering as possible todestroy peace and freedom, you will understand that chaos and conflict areanything but a ‘problem’. Quite the opposite, it’s all going according to plan.These are some of the key coordinates that people need to understand:> 1)The Illuminati use the technique I have dubbed Problem-Reaction-Solution to> ‘justify’ actions that would otherwise be widely opposed. Without the lie> about ‘weapons of mass destruction’ (an invented problem), they would never> have been able to sell the ‘solution’ – the invasion of Iraq.> 2)The Reptilians want to seize control of the planet and vital to that is to> control the Middle and Near Eastern oil fields in Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and> so on, plus the massive oil and gas reserves around the Caspian Sea.> 3)To do all this, they need excuses to invade those countries if they will> not, like Libya, come quietly with their hands up.> 4)Israel is an Illuminati-created and controlled state through its> manufactured political movement called ‘Zionism’, and it is being used to> generate constant unrest and conflict in the target area – the Middle East.> 5)The State of Israel was bombed and terrorised into existence by invaders> coordinated and manipulated by the Reptilian House of Rothschild. The> incumbent population, the Palestinians, were removed from power in their own> country and forced into little more than slavery by their invaders.> 6)The Illuminati want to bring the United States and its allies into a war> with China to create a massive global problem in need of a global solution –> the creation of a world government and world army to ‘stop it ever happening> again’. (The focus on China’s associate state, North Korea, is part of this.)> 7)Chaos = control, while harmony = freedom.> 8)The plan is for a planet controlled by a world government and army that> would impose its will on a microchipped, constantly watched and controlled> population.In the light of this, we can look again at current events and see foreign policy‘problems’ from a rather different perspective. What is happening today is thesame Reptilian hybrid plan for world domination that they embarked upon beforeand after the Great Flood and the cataclysmic geological upheavals thatdestroyed their ‘homeland’ of Mu/Lemuria, and the one they were infiltrating –Atlantis. Those manipulating world events today are, to use their biblical name,the Nefilim, and in this chapter, or ‘dot’, I am going to show how the Nefilimin the dark suits connect in common purpose through the Illuminati web.Blueprint for conquestIn Tales from the Time Loop, I detailed the background to a ‘Neocon’organization in the United States called the Project for the New AmericanCentury (PNAC) and the plan for global conquest that it produced in September2000, entitled Rebuilding America’s Defenses: Strategies, Forces, And ResourcesFor A New Century. The term ‘Neocon’ is shorthand for ‘Neoconservatives’, theshadowy network of far-right crazies and organisations that came to power withGeorge W. Bush in 2001. To understand current events, especially since 9/11,people need to know about the Neocons and how they have manipulated the bogus‘war on terror’. They are a Reptilian hybrid strand-in-the-web, and theircontrol of the American government, military and media, has advanced the agendain enormous leaps via their puppet president. The PNAC policy document waspublished a year to the month before 9/11, and two months before Bush officiallywon the rigged 2000 election that brought the very people behind the document topower in the White House, Pentagon and other departments of state. These werethe document’s main demands:> •US military control of the Gulf region whether or not Saddam Hussein was in> power: ‘While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate> justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf> transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein’ (my emphasis).> •The US to ‘fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre> wars’ as a ‘core mission’.> •US forces to be ‘the cavalry on the new American frontier’.> •Action to discourage advanced industrial nations from challenging US> leadership or aspiring to a larger regional or global role.> •Exploitation of allies like the UK as ‘the most effective and efficient means> of exercising American global leadership’.> •Ensuring that ‘peacekeeping’ missions have ‘American political leadership,> rather than that of the United Nations’.> •Permanent US bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.> •Increased military pressure on China: ‘It is time to increase the presence of> American forces in South East Asia’, which will lead to ‘American and allied> power providing the spur to the process of democratisation in China’.> •The ‘creation of “US Space Forces” to dominate space, and the total control> of cyberspace to prevent “enemies” [opponents of the agenda] using the> Internet against the US [Illuminati]’.> •Development of new methods of attack – electronic, ‘non-lethal’ and> biological. These, it said, would be more widely available and ‘combat is> likely to take place in new dimensions, in space, cyberspace and perhaps the> world of microbes ... advanced forms of biological warfare that can “target”> specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror> to a politically useful tool’ (my emphasis).> •The development of a ‘worldwide command-and-control system’ [world army] to> contain the ‘dangerous’ regimes of North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran.> •This ‘American grand strategy’ to be advanced ‘as far into the future as> possible’.The PNAC document said that this ‘process of transformation’ was likely to be along one – ‘absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new PearlHarbor’. What happened at precisely the right time to advance these plansdramatically? 9/11. The American Free Press asked Christopher Maletz, assistantdirector of the Project for the New American Century, what was meant by the needfor ‘a new Pearl Harbor’. He said they needed more money to increase the defencebudget for new armaments and future capabilities. ‘Without some disaster orcatastrophic event the politicians and the military would have not have approvedthis’, Maletz said. September 11th came one year to the month after the Projectfor the New American Century document was published, and nine months after thosewho produced it came to power with Bush. Since then, 9/11 has been used tojustify the imposition of the very agenda detailed in the document. Bush evencalled September 11th ‘our Pearl Harbor’, and once you understand the backgroundit is no longer a ‘mystery’ why the official story of 9/11 is a lie from startto finish – see Alice in Wonderland and The World Trade Center Disaster. Thereason the official version makes no sense is simple: it’s not true. The attackswere an inside job engineered by the very same forces that have used them to‘justify’ the fast-emerging Orwellian state. Problem-Reaction-Solution. GeorgeBush’s State of the Union speech in January 2002, in which he dubbed Iraq, Iranand North Korea ‘the Axis of Evil’, was written by David Frum, one of theNeocons closely connected with the Project for the New American Century and itsinterlocking organisations like the American Enterprise Institute. All of thesegroups are ultimately arms of the Reptilian hybrid Illuminati. The Neocongodfather is the late Leo Strauss, a German-born Khazar/Sumerian ‘philosopher’,who believed that people must be governed by a ‘pious elite’. He must havemissed the fact that they already are. This Internet article describes the worldaccording to Strauss and, therefore, the Neocons:> Strauss thought that the best way for ordinary human beings to raise> themselves above the beasts is to be utterly devoted to their nation and> willing to sacrifice their lives for it. He recommended a rabid nationalism> and a militant society modelled on Sparta. He thought that this was the best> hope for a nation to be secure against her external enemies as well as the> internal threat of decadence, sloth, and pleasure. A policy of perpetual war> against a threatening enemy is the best way to ward off political decay. And> if the enemy cannot be found, then it must be invented. This is precisely what the Neocons behind the Bush administration have done.They call their enemy ‘Islamic terrorists’.The PersonnelThe Project for the New American Century personnel are highly significant topast and current events. The organisation was established in 1997 by WilliamKristol and Robert Kagan and has been ‘wound down’ after its exposure byconspiracy researchers began to threaten the secrecy of the Illuminati agenda.PNAC operatives now work through other related organisations and groups. WilliamKristol appears to have been the main instigator of the PNAC on behalf of theBradley Foundation, yet another link in the ‘foundation’ network I mentionedearlier. Kristol is a former chief of staff to Father Bush’s vice-president DanQuayle and was known as ‘Quayle’s brain’. I always wondered where it was.Kristol is now editor of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Weekly Standard in Washingtonthat campaigns for Neocon policies. He is a regular contributor to theMurdoch-owned Fox News, the most blatantly-biased television channel I have seenanywhere in the ‘Western’ world. Kristol told the BBC: ‘American power shouldnot just be used in defence of American interests, but for the promotion ofAmerican principles … we are going to have to bring down a series of regimes whoare sponsors of a network of various terrorist organisations’. He named them asIran, Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and North Korea. Robert Kagan (the nameof the Khazar king) is an American Neoconservative ‘scholar’ and ‘politicalcommentator’. He graduated from Yale University in 1980, where he joined theIlluminati Skull and Bones Society, and he is a member of the Illuminati Councilon Foreign Relations. Both of these PNAC founders are Khazar/Sumerians withclose ties to Israel, and they are pushing an agenda for ‘American’ control ofthe Middle and Near East (and further), which is precisely what Israel wants tohappen. These are some of the other members of the Project for the New AmericanCentury:Image [../Images/00172.jpg]Figure 167: ‘Hello my friend’ – Donald Rumsfeld greets Saddam in 1983. He was inBaghdad for the Reagan–Bush administration to arrange for chemical andbiological weapons to be shipped to Iraq Donald Rumsfeld (PNAC founding member):Defense Secretary during 9/11, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and thelaunch of the ‘war on terrorism’. He ensured that the blueprint produced by thePNAC was slavishly followed on his watch in the Pentagon. Rumsfeld said SaddamHussein was so dangerous they had to remove him, but this was the same Rumsfeldwho visited Baghdad in 1983 to meet Saddam on behalf of the Reagan–Bushadministration to arrange for the shipment of chemical and biological weaponsfrom US corporations. This information is contained in declassified US StateDepartment documents that came to light in late 2002. Rumsfeld’s meeting withSaddam, preceded by a warm handshake caught on camera, was part of theReagan–Bush (in other words Bush) policy of close cooperation with the Iraqidictator (Figure 167). The documents reveal that the United States increasedarms supplies to Saddam even after he had used US-supplied poison gas againstthe Kurds in 1987 and 1988. Boy George Bush and Tony Blair constantly repeatedin ‘justifying’ the 2003 invasion of Iraq that Saddam had used chemical weapons‘against his own people’ while failing to mention that the US and Britain hadsupplied the means to do it. What’s more, Rumsfeld was on the board of theEuropean engineering company, ABB, when it supplied nuclear technology to NorthKorea in 2000. This is yet another example of the secret agenda and the public‘movie’ running side by side. Rumsfeld was involved in supplying the ‘problems’that the movie could later claim made action necessary against Iraq and NorthKorea. This is happening all the time. Rumsfeld is a member of the BilderbergGroup and the Council on Foreign Relations.Dick Cheney (PNAC founding member):US Vice-President and on the ‘board of advisors’ to the Jewish Institute forNational Security Affairs (JINSA) – a ‘think-tank that puts Israel and itssecurity at the heart of US foreign policy’. He was Defense Secretary to FatherGeorge Bush during the 1991 Gulf War and he has been the real power in the WhiteHouse behind the village idiot. Cheney was head of the oil services giant,Halliburton, from 1995 to 2000, when the company enjoyed contracts with SaddamHussein’s Iraq and worked with other terrorist dictatorships to line itspockets. Since Cheney came to power and helped to engineer the invasion of Iraq,Halliburton has received billions in Iraq contracts not tendered to othercompanies. Cheney was behind the appointments of Neocons Donald Rumsfeld, PaulWolfowitz, John Bolton and Elliot Abrams to government. All are PNAC members.His wife, Lynne, is a senior fellow with the Neocon American EnterpriseInstitute and his daughter, Elizabeth, became Deputy Assistant Secretary ofState for Near East Affairs. Cheney is a very sick and disturbed entity indeed,as we shall see. He’s a member of the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commissionand Council on Foreign Relations.Paul Wolfowitz:Khazar/Sumerian Deputy Defense Secretary, whom Bush calls ‘Wolfie’, and a farright supporter of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA).Wolfowitz, who has relatives in Israel, has also served as the Bushadministration’s liaison to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one ofthe leading lobby groups in Washington, which campaigns for policies favourableto Israel. To say the least, he has extremely close ties to the Israeligovernment and was even investigated for providing a classified document toIsrael on the proposed sale of US weapons to an Arab government. This is justthe background you need to be accepted as an impartial voice on Middle Eastpolicy. Wolfowitz was the dominant power at the Pentagon, more so than Rumsfeld.Rarely is the person officially in charge the one truly in control. Wolfowitzwas a major orchestrator of the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq before leavingto continue his Illuminati service as head of the World Bank. He lost the job in2007 after manipulating promotion and a big salary increase for his girlfriendwho also worked for the World Bank. These people are so genetically corrupt theycan’t help themselves. Give them the world and they want two. Wolfowitz is amember of the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and TrilateralCommission.Lewis Libby (PNAC founding member):Chief of Staff to Cheney and close friend, confidant and protégé of Wolfowitz.He served in Father George Bush’s Defense Department and is closely connectedwith the Illuminati Rand Corporation (another tax-exempt foundation), oilcompanies and the defence contractor, Northrop Grumman, which, like the RandCorporation, enjoys massive contracts with the Pentagon. Libby was a lawyer forconvicted felon and Israeli spy Mark Rich who was pardoned by Illuminati frontman and crook, Bill Clinton, in his last days as president. In 2005, Libbyresigned after being indicted by a grand jury for the obstruction of justice,perjury and making false statements. He was convicted in March 2007, but hisjail sentence was commuted by Boy Bush with the probability that a full pardonwill follow. Months after he was charged he joined the Hudson Institute (stillanother tax-exempt foundation) as a senior advisor on ‘issues relating to thewar on terror and the future of Asia’, among other things. Libby is a member ofthe Council on Foreign Relations and according to Washington investigativejournalist, Wayne Madsen, he is a long-serving agent for the Israeli(Rothschild) Mossad.John Bolton:Served with the State Department, Justice Department and the government’sinternational ‘aid’ agency, USAID, under Father George Bush. He becameunder-secretary for arms control and international security in the StateDepartment, and was at the heart of the conspiracy to invade Iraq in league withhis PNAC associates. He was also one of Bush’s vote counters during the riggedelection in Florida. Bolton is a member of the Jewish Institute for NationalSecurity Affairs (JINSA) and a vice-president at the far-right AmericanEnterprise Institute, as well as being involved with the Project for the NewAmerican Century. Bolton is reported to think the ‘war on terrorism’ is WorldWar Four and could take forty years to finish. No surprise then, that Bushselected him to be the US Ambassador to the United Nations where he pursued theIlluminati agenda with his usual gusto and brutality. In December 2006, he wasforced to resign when it became clear that, despite every effort from the WhiteHouse, the Senate would not confirm his nomination. Bolton is a member of theCouncil on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group.Elliott Abrams:A Khazar/Sumerian who pleaded guilty on two counts of lying to Congress aboutthe Iran-Contra arms-for-drugs scandal, but was pardoned by Father George Bush.Abrams tried to cover up the murder of hundreds of civilians at El Mozote by anelite US-trained military unit in El Salvador. In 1993, a UN truth commission,which investigated 22,000 atrocities during the twelve-year El Salvador civilwar, found that 85 per cent of the abuses were the work of theReagan–Bush–Abrams-supported right-wing military. Condoleezza Rice appointedAbrams, as, get this, Senior Director for Democracy, Human Rights andInternational Operations at the National Security Council in 2001. A year later,she made him Senior Director for Near East and North African Affairs, includingArab-Israel relations and American efforts to promote ‘peace and security’ inthe region. Abrams is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and on theadvisory council of the American Jewish Committee.Dov Zakheim:An ordained Orthodox Khazar/Sumerian rabbi who carries an Israeli passport. Hisgrandfather, Julius Zakheim (Zhabinka), was a Russian rabbi who married arelative of Karl Marx, and his father, Rabbi Jacob I. Zakheim, was a rabidZionist who numbered terrorist and former Israeli Prime Minister, MenachemBegin, among his friends. Father Zakheim was a member of Betar, a ‘youthmovement’. This was part of the Jewish terrorist network that included theHaganah, Irgun and Stern gangs, which bombed Israel into existence in 1947.Betar was founded by Ze’ev Jabotinsky, an admirer of Mussolini, and its memberswore dark brown uniforms with military slogans based on fascist movements. Itwas part of the network that spawned the Likud Party in Israel. Dov Zakheim, whostudied at Oxford University and exclusive Zionist colleges and schools, wasDeputy Undersecretary of Defense for Planning and Resources in the Reagan–Bushadministration and served in several other defence posts. He became a policy‘advisor’ (always watch the ‘advisors’) to George W. Bush in a group thatincluded Neocons Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and CondoleezzaRice, and called itself ‘The Vulcans’. Zakheim was the CEO of SPC International,a subsidiary of System Planning Corporation, which specialised in electronicwarfare technologies, including remote-controlled aircraft systems. I have nodoubt that the planes involved in 9/11 were remotely controlled from the ground,the technology for which is now well advanced – see Alice in Wonderland and theWorld Trade Center Disaster.Four months before 9/11, Zakheim became the Comptroller in charge of expenditureat the Pentagon and he was in that job when it was discovered that threetrillion dollars was missing from the Pentagon accounts. He was one of theauthors of the PNAC document in September 2000 that called for a massiveincrease in defence spending and talked of the need for ‘a new Pearl Harbor’.While Pentagon Comptroller, he arranged for US F-16 and F-15 fighters to beclassified as military surplus and sold to Israel at a knock-down price. It isthanks to him that Israel has one of the biggest air forces in the world.Zakeim, who was described by one writer as a ‘bionic Zionist’, is on the boardof advisers of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA). Youwould think that, after overseeing the loss of three trillion dollars at thePentagon, he might struggle to find future employment, but not so. He left thePentagon in 2004 to join Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the world’s mostprestigious consulting firms, which works closely with the super secretIlluminati front called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.This is the research arm of the Department of Defense. Among Booz AllenHamilton’s clients has been Blessed Relief, a charity linked to Osama bin Laden.As one writer said of Zakeim’s career move: ‘… the dark card was shifted toanother part of the deck’. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.Douglas Feith:Khazar/Sumerian under-secretary for policy at the Pentagon at the time of 9/11,who selected the members of the Defense Policy Board. He was educated at theJesuit Georgetown University where he is now on the faculty of the Edmund A.Walsh School of Foreign Service. Feith has served Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz andanother Neocon ‘godfather’, Richard Perle. As with Dov Zakheim, his father,Dalck Feith, was a member of the Israeli terrorist ‘youth movement’, Betar. BoyFeith founded the law firm Feith and Zell, based initially in Israel, and theirclients have included Northrop Grumman, the major military contractor andIlluminati to its screw washers. It won many contracts from the Pentagon duringhis stewardship. Feith and Zell joined with the Israel-based Zell, Goldberg andCo to create the Fandz International Law Group. When the initial ‘shock and awe’invasion was completed in Iraq, the Fandz website said the group had … ‘recentlyestablished a task force dealing with issues and opportunities relating to therecently ended war with Iraq, and is assisting regional construction andlogistics firms to collaborate with contractors from the United States, andother coalition countries, in implementing infrastructure and otherreconstruction projects in Iraq’. Let me put it another way: It was making akilling from a war supported and engineered by one of its own, Douglas Feith. Hewas also involved in producing false intelligence reports to justify the warand, according to journalist Bob Woodward’s book, Plan of Attack, militarycommander General Tommy Franks described Feith as ‘the fucking stupidest guy onthe face of the earth’. Was it stupidity or calculated deceit? Mostly the latterfor sure, although having seen him interviewed I can understand the sentiment –he does come across as someone with a serious neuron deficiency. Feith is avehement and slavish supporter of Israel, like all the Neocons, and he was givenan award by the Zionist Organisation of America that cited him as a ‘pro-Israelactivist’. He’s Dov Zakeim’s gofer and, like Wolfowitz, Feith was investigatedabout providing classified material to Israel. He is a member of the BilderbergGroup and Council on Foreign Relations.Richard Perle:Khazar/Sumerian former Assistant Defense Secretary to Reagan–Bush, a leadingmember of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) and thechairman of the far-right American Enterprise Institute (AEI) on 17th Street inWashington, which has Cheney’s wife, Lynne, among its number. Fourteen membersof the AEI organisation were appointed to the Bush cabinet and others areelsewhere in the administration. Bush told an AEI conference on February 26th,2003: ‘At the American Enterprise Institute some of the finest minds in ournation are at work in some of the greatest challenges to our nation. You do suchgood work that my administration has borrowed twenty such minds’ (which istwenty more than he has). Perle has so many of his associates in the Bushgovernment that they are known as the ‘String of Perles’, and he is referred toas the ‘Neocons political godfather’. At the Pentagon, he was nicknamed the‘Prince of Darkness’ for his hard-line beliefs, and he introduced a number ofstaunchly pro-Israel activists who dramatically increased weapons sales toIsrael. He is a former employee of Israeli weapons manufacturer, Soltam, and amember of several other right-wing groups like the Foundation for the Defense ofDemocracies (along with James Woolsey, the former CIA chief and member of theProject for the New American Century). Perle is a former aide to one-timeIsraeli premier, Benjamin Netanyahu, and in 1996 he simultaneously advised boththe Bob Dole campaign in the United States and the Netanyahu campaign in Israel.When Netanyahu was asked what the attacks of 9/11 would mean for Israel, hereplied: ‘It’s very good … Well, it’s not good, but it will generate immediatesympathy [for Israel]’. Oh, that’s okay then.Perle was also advisor to the lobbying firm run by Douglas J. Feith, thePentagon’s Under-Secretary of Defense. Before the invasion of Iraq, Perleadvised clients of the investment house, Goldman Sachs, about investmentopportunities in Iraq when the US was in control. He is a director of thesoftware company Autonomy Corp, which includes the Pentagon among its clients.Autonomy said it expected its profits to increase dramatically after the Iraqinvasion that Perle helped to orchestrate. Perle is a member of the DefensePolicy Board that advises the Pentagon and another member is Henry Kissinger, amajor Illuminati operative of the last forty years. Perle had to resign aschairman of the Board when conflicts of interest were exposed. He stood downafter it was reported that he had worked as a consultant to the bankrupttelecommunications company, Global Crossing Ltd, which was trying to getPentagon approval to be sold to Asian investors. The Los Angeles Times revealedthat Perle briefed an investment seminar on ways to profit from the conflict inIraq and North Korea just weeks after he received a top-secret governmentbriefing on the two countries. Perle is a member of the Bilderberg Group.Michael Ledeen:Another member of the American Enterprise Institute and involved in the 1970s inthe ‘shadowy world of right-wing Italian politics’, according to a BBCdocumentary. Ledeen has close ties to Henry Kissinger, the Illuminati ‘RomanCatholic’ front Opus Dei, and the Italian P-2 Masonic Lodge once headed by hisassociate, Licio Gelli, the Mussolini fascist and Knight of Malta. FrancescoPazienza, who is also reported to be close to Michael Ledeen, was suspected ofsetting up the murder of P-2 operative and ‘God’s banker’, Roberto Calvi. BothGelli and Pazienza, associates of Ledeen, ended up in jail. Ledeen also hadsecret meetings with the Israeli government in the 1980s that led,‘inadvertently’ he says, to the Iran–Contra arms-for-drugs affair coordinatedthrough the Reagan–Bush White House. He says: ‘All the great scholars who havestudied the American character have come to the conclusion that we are awar-like people. We love war’. He talks of the need to ‘free’ Iran, Syria, SaudiArabia, Libya and North Korea after the invasion of Iraq. Ledeen, who has amodel of Darth Vader on his desk, naturally says he is a student of the infamousmanipulator Machiavelli, and his attitude was encapsulated by this remark:‘Richard [Perle] says he doesn’t think Americans are vindictive. Well, I hopehe’s wrong’. Ledeen told the UK Daily Telegraph: ‘Undermining the governments ofother countries? No big deal’. He is a member of the Bilderberg Group.John Negroponte:This is a guy with an horrific CV. He was a major aide to the US embassy inVietnam from 1964, an advisor to the war criminal Henry Kissinger, and in chargeof Vietnam policy on the US National Security Council. In the 1980s, he carriedout the covert policy of Reagan–Bush to destroy the elected Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua and, as ambassador to Honduras, he administered amassive increase in US military support for the right wing government. It soaredfrom $4m to $77m and the country became known as ‘USS Honduras’. Negroponte wasalso fundamentally involved with the infamous Battalion 3-16 in Honduras, whichran a terror campaign of murder and torture against the people. He was USambassador to the United Nations at the time of 9/11, arguing the case for war,and was then sent by Boy Bush to take charge of operations in Iraq after theinvasion. Negroponte became the first Director of National Intelligence, a postcreated to centralise power over all US intelligence agencies in the hands ofone man – the PNAC Illuminati man. In 2007, he left to become Deputy Secretaryof State. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.Zalmay Khalilzad:The Afghanistan-born American who was made special envoy to Afghanistan beforethe war that installed his friend, Hamid Karsai, as leader. Khalilzad authored abook on Saddam with Paul Wolfowitz called Overthrow Him and encouraged his closefriend, George Shultz, the former Reagan–Bush Secretary of State, to use Iran tobring down Saddam. Like Cheney’s crooked aide Lewis Libby, Khalilzad has workedfor the Illuminati Rand Corporation, and he also served under Secretary of Stateand National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice (Council on Foreign Relations),when she was a director of Chevron. Once his job was done in Afghanistan,Khalilzad was appointed to be Bush’s ‘special envoy’ to Iraq to play a similarrole by installing a US puppet-government. He became a special advisor to theState Department under Reagan–Bush when he was very much involved in the armingof the Mujahadeen fighting the Russian occupation. This included Osama bin Ladenand what became known as ‘al-Qaeda’. Khalilzad is a member of the Council onForeign Relations.Jeb Bush:Brother of the brain cell and Governor of Florida during the State’s electionfraud in 2000 that stopped Al Gore becoming president. The Bush family iscorrupt to its core and fundamentally connected into the Illuminati web, as myother books have extensively detailed.Another man to mention is the Reagan–Bush Secretary of State, George Shultz. Hewas not an official member of the Project for the New American Century, butassociated with all its ruling members. Shultz played a central role in‘vetting’ Boy George Bush for the presidency, according to James Mann in hisbook, Rise of the Vulcans. He reports that Shultz met with Bush in his room atStanford University in the Spring of 1998. Also at the meeting was his protégé,Condoleezza Rice. Later, Shultz, Bush, Rice, Cheney, Wolfowitz and others metagain in Austin, Texas, where Bush was governor. Out of this meeting came the‘Vulcans’, the grouping that backed Bush for the presidency to govern on itsbehalf. Shultz was also co-chairman of the economic taskforce for Californiagovernor and Illuminati front man, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he’s a highlysignificant manipulator who prefers to operate behind the scenes where the realpower lies. His main base has been the Reptilian hybrid Bechtel Corporation,which was paid immense sums of money for ‘reconstruction work’ in Iraq after theinvasion.The Sumerian-Khazar MafiaThese are some of the people behind the Project for the New American Century andassociated groups which, before 9/11, planned the wars of global conquest knownas the ‘war on terrorism’ that has targeted, above all else, the countries ofIslam. At the same time, Neocon groups like the Project for the New AmericanCentury and the American Enterprise Institute are utterly dominated bysupporters of Israel, and they have engineered a US government policy ofinvasion and threats to countries in the Middle and Near East that suits thedesires of Israel. Can you imagine what would be said (and done) if it was foundthat a US administration controlled by fundamentalist supporters of Islamiccountries had orchestrated an American invasion of Israel? But it is Israeldoing the manipulating so – silence. To highlight these crucial facts is to becalled ‘anti- Semitic’ – the constant slur used by Reptilian hybrid fronts likethe Rothschild’s Anti- Defamation League (ADL) to discredit those who point outthe obvious unfairness and bias of this situation. Well, bollocks to the ADL andanyone else in the same category. It is a fact and it needs saying to get someperspective on what is happening here. They can call me what they like, I don’tgive a shit. The situation is the same with the Democrats. On September 2nd1994, Avonoam Bar-Yosef, writing in the prominent Israeli daily, Ma’Ariv, saidthat seven of the leading members of Bill Clinton’s National Security Councilwere Jewish (Sumerian-Khazar). The article, headlined ‘The Jews who runClinton’s Court’, quoted the rabbi of the Adath Yisrael Synagogue, as saying: ‘…for the first time in American history … the US has no longer a government ofGoyim [Gentiles], but an administration in which the Jews are full partners indecision making at all levels’. There will be no criticism of Israel or Zionism,either, from Nicolas Sarkozy, who became President of France in 2007. AustralianJewish News reported that his mother is from the Mallah (‘messenger’ or ‘angel’)family, one of the oldest Jewish families of Salonika, Greece. The Mallah’s havelong been active Zionists and in 1898 a Sarkozy relative published and edited ElAvenir, the leading paper of the Zionist national movement in Greece at thetime. Sarkozy’s father was a descendent of aristocracy in Sumerian-KhazarHungary. Sarkozy is there to do a job for the Reptilian hybrids by fundamentallychanging France and pushing the agenda on every front. Australian Jewish Newssaid that, as Minister of Interior, Sarkozy ‘shared much common policy groundwith former Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu’, and they have developeda ‘close friendship’. Really? You do surprise me.The head of US Homeland Security, the organisation taking advantage of 9/11 toimpose fascism on the people, is Michael Chertoff, the son of a rabbi. Hismother, Liva, was reportedly involved in Operation Magic Carpet, the top-secretairlifting of 45,000 Yemenite Jews to Israel in 1949 and 1950, and she laterworked with the Israeli airline, El AL. Chertoff’s wife was a co-chair of a‘civil rights committee’ for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), theRothschild–Mossad front in America that works to destroy civil rights, not leastfreedom of expression. This is the background to the head of an organisationtargeting ‘Islamic terrorism’. Any chance of bias, do you think? How come thereare so many Khazar/Sumerians in positions of political, banking, business,military, academic and media power when they represent only two per cent of theUS population, and the same in many other countries? How does this happen? Bymagic? These questions need asking, because if the same were true of Muslims orHindus there would be an outcry – from the Khazar/Sumerians. Now perhaps we canunderstand why, when an atrocity is committed against Israel, the media calls it‘Islamic terrorism’; but when staggering numbers of Palestinian or other Arabcivilians are killed, it is reported as Israel ‘defending itself’, or‘retaliating’ against terrorism. The mainstream media is largely controlled bythe same force through people like the Sumerian-Khazar Rupert Murdoch, and so itpushes the Illuminati line. What chance do the Palestinian people have offairness and justice when the major governments and media sources of the worldare manipulated by the very force that is dropping bombs on them and killingtheir children? What chance have they ever had since their country was invadedand their nation turned into slaves? None.And it is about time someone said so without fearing the consequences in slursand attacks from purveyors of hate like the Illuminati Anti-Defamation League.I ask people to put themselves in the position of the Palestinians for a moment.They had their country stolen from them by force and terrorism soon after theSecond World War, and they have been subjected ever since to grotesque andhorrific suppression, constant violence and domination. The Israeli governmentand military can do virtually whatever they like to them while the pathetic‘World Community’ looks the other way. The first Prime Minister of Israel, DavidBen-Gurion, summed up their aims in 1937 when he said:‘We must expel Arabs and take their places’. What if another people invaded yourland and did this to you, refusing even to acknowledge the injustice? What wouldwe do? The Palestinians believe they are without hope and they feelunderstandable fury at what is happening to their land, their homes, theirfamilies and themselves. Why wouldn’t they? Given the scale of provocation, itis a wonder that their violent response comes only from a small minority, andnot the great majority of decent and intelligent Palestinian and Arabic peoplewho just want peace and justice. It is an old, old truth. Ignore injustice forlong enough and violence will surely follow. The way to stop violence is toremove the injustice that is fuelling it, not respond with even more violence.Those, like the Neocons, who control the American and British administrations,and many others, have no desire for peace and justice. They want war andconquest and so that’s what we have. Israel and the United States and Britishgovernments – of all parties – are one and the same, controlled by the Reptilianhybrid network. This is why Israel can basically do what it wants while thePalestinians are condemned at every turn.Targeting IranAs I write, there is apparently a new psychological illness going around called‘Deja Flu’ that is affecting billions of people all over the world. It is alsobeing dubbed ‘Word Flu’ because the victims get the feeling that they have heardsomething all before. The clinical name, apparently, is ‘Groundhog Syndrome’.The symptoms are most virulent, it seems, whenever people hear anyone from theAmerican government mention the word ‘Iran’. This triggers powerful memories,known as ‘flashbacks’, and the patient suffers from a form of confusion andbewilderment that has been given the name ‘Annum Uncertainty Disorder’. Theycan’t distinguish between present time and the propaganda against Iraq in 2003.I have told sufferers not to worry because what they are experiencing isperfectly natural. It is the psychological consequence of observing people withthe chronic condition long suffered by the British and American governments –and all the others – and known as ‘Whopper’s Disease’. This is an extremeversion of Tarradiddle Disorder. Tarradiddle is defined in the dictionary as‘silly pretentious speech or writing; twaddle’. The synonyms offered includefib; lie; prevarication – a statement that deviates from or perverts the truth;cock-and-bull story; fairy story; fairytale; song and dance – an interesting buthighly implausible story, often told as an excuse; silly talk or writing;baloney; bilgewater; bosh; drool; humbug; tommyrot; tosh; hokum; nonsense; bunk;and cant – a characteristic language of a particular group (as among thieves).All the above apply as I observe the truly toe-curling sight of theNeocon-controlled American government desperately seeking an excuse to tick offthe next country in its campaign of global tyranny – Iran. This is right in linewith the Project for the New American Century document in September 2000.The Neocon propaganda war against Iran really picked up after the election ofMahmoud Ahmadinejad as President of the Islamic Republic in 2005. After he tookoffice in the August, he was soon making speeches that the American manipulatorsand spinners must have dreamed of. I cannot believe this was a fortuitouscoincidence. He defeated the one-time favourite, the former President, AkbarHashemi Rafsanjani, whose reputation and record would have made it almostimpossible to demonise Iran as a threat to America or anyone else. MehdiKarroubi, a Reformist candidate seeking to open Iranian society and oppose theextremes of hardline Islam, finished third in the first round of voting. He thenalleged that a network of mosques, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps andBasij militia forces had illegally generated support for Ahmadinejad, andspecifically named Mojtaba Khamenei, a son of the Supreme Leader AyatollaKhamenei, as being involved in this election fraud. The Ayatollah told Karroubithat the allegations were below his dignity and he would not allow the crisis inIran that they could cause. Karroubi wrote back to resign from all his politicalposts and some Reformist newspapers were stopped from publication for publishingKarroubi’s letter. I am not saying that Ahmadinejad was manipulated into powerbecause I don’t know, but I suspect that is what happened, not least with thelong history of covert involvement in Iran by British and American militaryintelligence. Prime Minister Dr Mohammed Mossadegh was ousted in 1953 in aCIA-planned coup called Operation Ajax and British and American manipulationreplaced him with the vicious dictator, the Shah of Iran. The same combinationremoved the Shah for Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979. Why would the same forces notcontinue to be involved in election manipulation in Iran when they so badlyneeded Ahmadinejad to defeat Rafsanjani for their ‘Axis of Evil’ plan to work?It doesn’t even need Ahmadinejad to be aware of what has happened behind thescenes, in the same way that Margaret Thatcher wasn’t aware when she wasmanipulated into power in Britain. They knew how she saw the world and what shebelieved in, and so they knew basically what she would do and say. EitherAhmadinejad is knowingly involved, or he’s an idiot, because all he needed to dowas to quietly get on with his job and leave the nuclear development alone for awhile, and he would have left the Neocon-Nazis with nowhere to go. He must haveknown that Iran was on the hit-list, but he still opened his mouth and thepropagandists walked right in.After Iraq, however, it is far harder to justify another invasion and thedesperation betrayed in the daily excuse-making with regard to Iran has mesquirming in the chair. They are so bereft of ideas, and a genuine reason, thatthe Iraq file, now utterly discredited, has been retrieved from the bin. We aretold that Ahmadinejad could be ‘another Hitler’, which is what they said aboutSaddam Hussein, and they have simply dusted off the old song sheet. They saidthat Iraq was dangerous because of (non-existent) weapons of mass destructionthat could be used against the West; they say that Iran’s nuclear program isdesigned to produce nuclear weapons that could be used against the West. Theysaid that Iraq had (non-existent) connections with ‘al-Qaeda’; they say thatIran is supplying weapons to terrorist ‘insurgents’ in Iraq. This is making noimpact whatsoever on anyone who can still claim ownership of their neuronactivity, and it is highly likely they are planning events to ‘up the ante’, agambling term for increasing the stakes. We have seen a military build up goingon within shooting distance of the Iranian border – precisely what happened withIraq as the preparations became ever more detailed while Bush and Blair weresaying that ‘no decision to invade had been taken’. Of course it had been made –and many years before. The same is true with Iran, as outlined in the September2000 document produced by the Project for the New American Century.Manufactured mayhemThe respected New Yorker journalist, Seymour Hersh, is rightly acknowledged forhis exposure over the years of government secrets and mendacity; but without thecoordinates of what the game is, how it is played and what it seeks to achieve,you can get seriously lost in the maze and mirrors. In an article in early 2007,he talked of a ‘redirection’ in the US Middle East strategy. He said the keyplayers behind the ‘redirection’ were Vice-President Dick Cheney; DeputyNational Security Adviser Elliott Abrams; Zalmay Khalilzad, the departingAmbassador to Iraq and nominee for United Nations Ambassador; and Prince Bandarbin Sultan, the Saudi national security adviser and deeply corrupt vassal of theBush and Rockefeller families. All these people have been exposed so often in mybooks, going back to the mid-1990s, that their ears must be ablaze. Cheney,Abrams and Khalilzad are all members of the Project for the New AmericanCentury. The ‘new’ plan and ‘redirection’, we are told, is to use the divisionsbetween the Islamic ‘Sunni’ and ‘Shiite’ factions that have deepened intooutright civil war in Iraq. The Sunnis and Shiites argue over who has the rightto be their caliph or leader. Here is one explanation at History News Networks:> The Sunni branch believes that the first four caliph – Mohammed’s successors –> rightfully took his place as the leaders of Muslims. They recognize the heirs> of the four caliphs as legitimate religious leaders. These heirs ruled> continuously in the Arab world until the break-up of the Ottoman Empire> following the end of the First World War. Shiites, in contrast, believe that> only the heirs of the fourth caliph, Ali, are the legitimate successors of> Mohammed. What’s the Arabic for grow up?Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in January 2007 that there was ‘a newstrategic alignment in the Middle East’, separating ‘reformers’ and ‘extremists’(all Newspeak). She said the Sunni states were the ‘centres of moderation’ (theydo as they’re told), while Shiite-controlled Iran, Syria and Hezbollah inLebanon were ‘on the other side of that divide’. Iran and Syria, she said, ‘havemade their choice and their choice is to destabilise’. Who were two of the maintarget states in the Project for the New American Century document of September2000? Iran and Syria. This is why the speeches that Bush is told to read containthe same ever-present mantra:> These two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their> territory to move in and out of Iraq ... Iran is providing material support> for attacks on American troops. We will disrupt the attacks on our forces.> We’ll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria. And we will seek out> and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our> enemies in Iraq. Translated from the Orwellian it means: ‘We’re going to have yet another war assoon as we can get away with it’. Let’s get one thing crystal clear. What ishappening in the Middle East is not a ‘new’ policy, nor is it a ‘redirection’.It is the continuation of a policy that was decided long before the firstmissile scorched the Iraqi skyline. I have been saying through all thecondemnations of US government ‘incompetence’ in Iraq that it is notincompetence. The numbskull president has not been orchestrating the plan, mindsof great intellect have been doing it. Sick they may be, but they are mastermanipulators. The plan all along has been to play Sunni against Shiite to divideand rule the Middle East just as they are doing with Palestine factions in Gaza.Now we are seeing the stage where they seek to isolate their targets, Iran andSyria, from the rest of the Arab world led by Saudi Arabia, or Saudi America, asit should rightly be called. The policy ‘shift’, we are told, has brought SaudiArabia and Israel into a ‘new strategic embrace’, largely because ‘bothcountries see Iran as an existential threat’. Oh, I think they’ve been having acovert cuddle for a long time, you know, given that they are both controlled bythe same force. If Iran and Syria were to fall, the plan is to pick off therest, who will, by then, come quietly. US Central Command, or ‘CentCom’, hasadvanced plans in place for a ‘Shock and Awe’ attack on Iran’s militaryinfrastructure and nuclear facilities, and aircraft carriers have been deployedto the Persian Gulf. This represents the biggest concentration of navalcapability since the Iraq invasion kicked off in 2003. The US military hasarrested and interrogated hundreds of Iranians in Iraq, according to the sourcesof Seymour Hersh. ‘The word went out last August for the military to snatch asmany Iranians in Iraq as they can’, a former senior intelligence official toldhim:> They had five hundred locked up at one time. We’re working these guys and> getting information from them. The White House goal is to build a case that> the Iranians have been fomenting the insurgency and they’ve been doing it all> along – that Iran is, in fact, supporting the killing of Americans. Hersh said the Pentagon consultant confirmed that hundreds of Iranians have beencaptured by American forces, including many Iranian humanitarian and aidworkers, who ‘get scooped up and released in a short time’, after they have beeninterrogated. This is what happened in Afghanistan and to others in Iraq whoended up in Guantanamo Bay and prisons like Abu Ghraib, or simply disappeared.The ‘Iran is killing our troops in Iraq’ strategy is the latest desperate effortto justify action against Iran. Cheney said that ‘every option is on the table’to ‘deal’ with Iran and that is always Newspeak for ‘we want to invade’. I haveseen so many articles saying what a disaster that would be and one of them said:> Taken together, the Bush administration’s strategy for the Middle East –> stretching from Lebanon and Syria to Iran and the Gulf states – can only> produce a catastrophe for working people throughout the region, in the United> States and internationally. Any US attack on Iran has the potential to plunge> the entire Middle East into conflict, drawing in America’s European and Asia> rivals, whose vital economic and strategic interests are at stake. Having> gambled and lost with their criminal invasion of Iraq, the gangsters in the> White House are doubling their bets across the board and dicing with the> future of humanity. The point is missed again. It is meant to be ‘a catastrophe for working peoplethroughout the region, in the United States and internationally’. It is meant to‘plunge the entire Middle East into conflict, drawing in America’s European andAsia rivals, whose vital economic and strategic interests are at stake’. It ismeant to dice ‘with the future of humanity’. We are dealing with a force behindthese thugs-in-government who care nothing for the consequences of anyone oranything. Their quest for global domination is all that matters and to achievethat, anything goes. Ask the victims of 9/11 and the people of Afghanistan,Lebanon and Iraq. When we look at the events in the Middle East in the light ofthe manipulators behind American governments, they seem less like foreign policy‘problems’ and more like foreign policy goals. The Project for the New AmericanCentury, just one of the propaganda arms for the agenda of racist hatred, calledin 2000 for the conquest of Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Syria and others. Thiswould not have been possible without 9/11 and at the time of those attacks theIlluminati Neocons, under the command of the Rothschilds and others, controlledthe White House through Bush and Cheney. They also held all the major positionsat the Pentagon, including Defence Secretary, Deputy Defence Secretary andComptroller. In their own words a year earlier, they wanted to launch wars ofconquest in the Middle and Near East and dramatically increase militaryspending, and they admitted that this could only happen in the wake of a ‘newPearl Harbor’. September 11th gave them exactly what they needed and they werein positions both to organise the attacks, cover up what really happened andtake advantage of them in pursuit of their agenda.Coincidence?Not a chance."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 13 9/11: The Big Lie > I’ll call myself a conspiracy theorist if you call yourself a coincidence> theorist. > John Judge I was walking around some ancient earthworks in Dorset, England, when I heardfrom an American couple about the attacks that have become known as 9/11. It wasthe afternoon – English time – of September 11th, 2001.As I heard the brief details recounted, there was no doubt in my mind or, mostimportantly, in my intuition. This was a massive Problem-Reaction-Solution toadvance the global agenda that I had spent the previous decade warning about. Ikept an appointment a few miles away with an alternative healer and saw some ofthe television pictures from New York. The more I heard, the more obvious itbecame. Those who would condemn the attacks as the work of ‘Islamic terrorists’were actually the ones responsible for them. Or, at least, they knew that theirmasters were. As I drove home, listening to the coverage on the radio, the nextstage was painfully clear. Actions and responses to advance human control andsuppression would now be justified by what had happened in New York, Washingtonand Pennsylvania. Such thoughts and views were not shared by many in these earlydays, weeks and months and they certainly weren’t popular. I was asked to appearon a Los Angeles radio station days after the attacks when they saw on theInternet that I was saying it was an inside job by elements within the USgovernment and related agencies and overseas connections. You can imagine theresponse. I was ‘interviewed’ by two ‘DJs’ and I never did work out which onehad the brain cell that day. ‘What are you on?’ was a pretty good summary oftheir reaction. I pointed out that this was precisely the reaction I expected,yawn, yawn, and I made them an offer – have me back in a few weeks and if A, B,and C had not happened I would hold my hand up and accept I was wrong. Theyagreed, but the phone was not to ring because A, B and C did happen. They werecalled the Patriot Act, the ‘war on terror’ and other fundamental assaults onfreedom that now issue almost by the day, justified by 9/11 and its aftermath.Once you identify a Problem-Reaction-Solution event, and you know the basicagenda it is seeking to advance, predicting the future, in theme, if not everydetail, becomes pretty straightforward.The overwhelming majority of shocked and bewildered humanity bought the officialstory. Nineteen Islamic extremists had hijacked four commercial aircraft usingbox cutters and plastic knives (no, I’m not kidding). They had flown three ofthe planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, while the other camedown in Pennsylvania after the passengers charged the cockpit. The story wasnonsense and has since been demolished by independent researchers and experts inthe fields of aviation, explosives, physics, engineering and building design.The Big Lie is taken apart in my book Alice in Wonderland and the World TradeCenter Disaster and you can go to the 9/11 archive at www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com] to see reports and video documentaries that make thefollowing very clear:> •The planes were not flown by Islamic pilots, most of whom could not> competently fly a one-engine Cessna at puddle-jumping flying schools.> •The twin towers did not collapse because of the heat from the fire. They were> brought down by controlled demolition.> •There are many questions to answer about whether Flight 77 really did hit the> Pentagon.> •Flight 93 did not crash in Pennsylvania because passengers attacked> terrorists in the cockpit.I am not going into all the fine detail about 9/11 here, because I have done soelsewhere, but I will present a summary as part of the dot-connecting process.Tony Blair told us the real reason for the engineered attacks when he said intheir wake:> This is a moment to seize. The kaleidoscope has been shaken, the pieces are in> flux, soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us reorder this world> around us. The whole idea was to create a massive problem – a state of fear, horror,confusion and ‘flux’ – for which the Illuminati could supply the ‘solution’, theOrwellian state. Once you realise this simple fact, the ‘mysteries’ and‘anomalies’ surrounding 9/11, and before and after, begin rapidly to dissolve.From that point of perception, what happened that day makes perfect sense. LeroyFletcher Prouty was a man with enormous experience in covert operations by theUS security apparatus. He worked with the Office of Strategic Services, theforerunner for the Central Intelligence Agency, and established Air DefenseCommand in 1950. He went on to work with the CIA, and for nine years he servedat the Pentagon as Briefing Officer for the Secretary of Defense, Chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff and Chief of Special Operations. In 1973, he revealedin his book, The Secret Team, that the CIA was a tool of a ‘high cabal’ ofindustrialists and bankers – the Reptilian hybrids in other words. Proutyrevealed the existence of the CIA Executive Action programme, which specialisedin removing foreign leaders ‘unfriendly’ to American (Illuminati) interests. Hesaid that this group was behind the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963under the direction of its head, Edward Lansdale, who was in Dallas acting ‘…like the orchestra leader, coordinating these things’. Prouty, who died of organfailure just three months before 9/11, clearly had a detailed knowledge of howcovert operations work. This is what he said about assassinations and it appliesjust as much to what happened on September 11th:> No one has to direct an assassination – it happens. The active role is played> secretly by permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has> the power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions? (My emphasis) We see this with virtually every assassination, John and Bobby Kennedy, MartinLuther King and Princess Diana included. At the crucial time, the usual level ofsecurity evaporates to ensure that the ‘hit’ can go ahead without challenge. Whohad the power to call off the normal level of security and response on 9/11? Thevery same people and forces that have used those attacks to impose the ‘war onterror’ and the Orwellian global state. Four airliners were hijacked in a periodof some two hours over what is supposed to be some of the most protectedairspace on the planet and nothing – nothing – was done that made any differenceto the outcome.Where was ‘SNORAD’?The procedure that operates on every other day involves the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA), the government or ‘civilian’ organisation responsible forair traffic control, and NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command,which defends the United States and Canada from air attack – except on September11th. NORAD is located at the Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado and itsoperations centre is 2,000 feet inside the nearby Cheyenne Mountain, which cameup in my research long before 9/11. NORAD’s responsibilities, to quote its ownwebsite, include:> … the monitoring of man-made objects in space, and the detection, validation,> and warning of attack against North America whether by aircraft, missiles, or> space craft, utilizing mutual support arrangements with other commands.> Aerospace control includes ensuring air sovereignty and air defense of the> airspace of Canada and the United States. NORAD has an agreement with the civilian Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)to respond when commercial aircraft are hijacked, lose contact with air trafficcontrollers, or stray off-course. What happened on 9/11, therefore, was exactlywhat NORAD is there to deal with and it certainly has the means to do so. Itsoperational centre inside Cheyenne Mountain is a colossal super-secret facilitymounted on more than 1,300 half-ton springs that allow it to sway up to a footin any direction should it be struck by an earthquake or nuclear attack (Figures168 and 169). NORAD and associated organisations based at the mountain employsome of the most brilliant technological minds in the world using and developingtechnology that is light years ahead of anything you will see in the publicarena. It is a big mistake to judge what is possible only on the basis oftechnology we know about. These guys aren’t working with that. The followinginformation comes from the official Cheyenne Mountain website and representsonly a fraction of what really goes on there. Other ‘early warning and response’organisations at the complex include Air Force Space Command, which is supposedto provide protection from space and missile attack. Space Command operates theSpace Defense Operations Center which, with its ‘worldwide sensors, under thedirection of Air Defense Command’, supported the first flight of the SpaceShuttle in April 1981. This has continued with every shuttle mission since. WhatI am saying here is that NORAD, and associated response organisations, wereworking with state of the art tracking technology, including the US satellitenetwork that can read your number plate from space. The Cheyenne Mountainwebsite tells us:> The Command Center is the heart of operations in Cheyenne Mountain. In this> center, the Command Director and his crew serve as the NORAD and US Space> Command Commander-in-chief’s direct representatives for monitoring,> processing, and interpreting missile, space or air events which could have> operational impacts on our forces or capabilities, or could be potential> threats to North America or US and allied forces overseas. The Command Center> is linked directly to the National Command Authorities of both the US and> Canada as well as to regional command centers overseas. When required, the> Command Director must consult directly with the NORAD and US Space Command> Commander-in-chief for time-critical assessments of missile, air, and space> events; he takes action to ensure the Commander-in-chief’s response and> direction are properly conveyed and executed … > … The Air Defense Operations Center provides command and control for the air> surveillance and air defense network for North America. In 1994, they> monitored over 700 ‘unknown’ radar tracks entering North American airspace.> Many of these were subsequently identified as friendly aircraft that had erred> from flight plans or used improper procedures. Image [../Images/00173.jpg]Figure 168: Cheyenne Mountain, the super-secret communications facility inColorado and home to NORAD operations on 9/11 Image [../Images/00174.jpg]Figure 169: Inside Cheyenne Mountain is state of the art communications andtracking technology … They boast that if a missile is fired anywhere in the world they know about it,and it is they who operate the tracking and surveillance technology that guidesAmerican troops on battlefields thousands of miles away in Afghanistan, Iraq andwherever next. But, hijacked planes in American airspace? Er, which button doyou press again?The NORAD commander at the time of September 11th was General Ralph E. Eberhart,who was also head of Space Command. He took over on February 18th 2000 fromGeneral Richard B. Myers, who became Deputy Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff at the Pentagon, and Chairman immediately after 9/11. Myers was the topuniform in command at the Pentagon when the attacks were happening and much moreabout his strange behaviour shortly. Eberhart and Myers also both served at the‘CIA’ Air Force Base at Langley, Virginia, from where, it is claimed, jets werescrambled (far too late) to intercept Flight 77 as it headed for Washington.What should have happened that day can be seen in the regulations available onthe Internet. When air traffic control loses contact with an aircraft throughdirect communication, or the plane’s transponder tracking system being switchedoff, the FAA immediately alerts NORAD and it scrambles jets to investigate. Inthe previous year of 2000, this happened 125 times in response to aircraftlosing contact with air traffic control. An example of this FAA–NORAD reactionprocedure can be seen in the case of the private Learjet carrying the golferPayne Stewart and his friends on October 25th 1999. Air traffic controllers lostcontact with Stewart’s plane after it took off from Orlando in Florida headingfor Dallas. When air traffic controllers realised all was not well, the FAAcontacted NORAD and fighter jets were scrambled to check out what was happening.The Learjet had suffered a pressurisation failure and was flying on autopilotwhile the real pilot and passengers were unconscious. An ABC News report,quoting the Air Force but differing slightly from the findings of the officialinvestigation, said that after contact was initially lost two F-15s from TyndallAir Force Base in Florida were sent to track the Learjet. The F-15s pulled backand two F-16s already in the air from Florida’s Eglin Air Force Base took over.When the Learjet reached the Midwest, the Eglin F-16s withdrew and four F-16sand a mid-air refuelling tanker from the Tulsa National Guard replaced them.Finally, two F-16s from Fargo, North Dakota, moved in. ‘Officials hoped that theF-16s could provide assistance to anyone on board who might have helped land theplane safely’, said ABC. When the Learjet ran out of fuel, the F-16 pilots saidthey saw the plane fall to the ground. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart saidthe National Security Council monitored the doomed flight, fearing the jet mightcrash in a populated area.That is what happens when Air Traffic Control loses contact with a Learjet, butwith four hijacked commercial airliners nothing was done that made anydifference to events. Why?What should have happenedThe official regulations and procedures of the FAA detail the response system.Chapter Seven [../Text/index_split_018.html#filepos655361] of the proceduresdeals with the ‘escort of hijacked aircraft’. It says that an FAA ‘hijackcoordinator’ on duty at the Washington DC headquarters will request the militaryto provide an escort for a confirmed hijacked plane to (a) assure positiveflight following (that’s staying on the authorised course to you and me); (b)report unusual observances; and (c) aid search and rescue in the event of anemergency. The escort service, say the regulations, will be requested by the FAAhijack coordinator by direct contact with the National Military Command Center(NMCC) at the Pentagon. Normally NORAD escort aircraft will take the requiredaction, it says. ‘The center/control tower shall coordinate with the designatedNORAD … military unit advising of the hijack aircraft’s location, direction offlight, altitude, type of aircraft and recommended flight plan to intercept thehijack aircraft’, the document instructs. Escort aircraft are told to positionthemselves five miles directly behind the hijacked plane and to approach it fromthe rear to avoid being seen. The escort plane should take the same altitude,speed and heading as the hijacked aircraft. When a hijacking happens over thecontinental United States, say the procedures, the ‘appropriate NORAD … seniorDirector’ is forwarded reports of the aircraft’s call sign of position oflatitude, heading, speed and altitude. An escort mission can be terminated byFAA headquarters, the National Command Center at the Pentagon, or major militarycommand authority – which includes NORAD.When a problem with an aircraft is considered a possible hijack by the airtraffic controller, a much higher level of command is activated. FAAspokeswoman, Alison Duquette, explained: ‘The air traffic controller wouldnotify the supervisor on the floor, who would then immediately notify the FAA’sregional operation center, who would notify NORAD, as well as others’. In thesecases, according to the regulations: ‘The escort service will be requested bythe FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact with the National Military CommandCenter (NMCC) [based at the Pentagon]’. The Defense Department (DOD) manualcovering plane hijackings says: ‘In the event of a hijacking, the NMCC will benotified by the most expeditious means by the FAA. The NMCC will, with theexception of immediate responses … forward requests for DOD assistance to theSecretary of Defense for approval’. It was because of this procedure that,according to CNN ‘… officers on [sic] the Joint Chiefs were monitoring the[Payne Stewart] Learjet on radar screens inside the Pentagon’s National MilitaryCommand Center’. Federal Aviation Administration regulations leave air trafficcontrollers in no doubt that they must never take chances. They are told that ifthere is an unexpected loss of radar or radio communication they must considerthat ‘an aircraft emergency exists’… and … ‘If … you are in doubt that asituation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as thoughit were an emergency’. Within Cheyenne Mountain is the Air Defense LiaisonOfficer, a top FAA official, who is there to coordinate between the FAA andNORAD in these situations. All these personnel and procedures were in place onSeptember 11th and yet nothing was done that affected events. Why?An important point to note. If you were ‘highly trained’ Arab terrorists fromthis ‘brilliantly organised’ network of Osama bin Laden – a network we are toldwas capable of hijacking four commercial aircraft at the same time in Americanairspace – one of your obvious and fundamental calculations would be thepossible NORAD reaction time once it was known that the planes had been seized.So, why did they choose to hijack the planes that hit the World Trade Center inBoston with a flight time to New York well in excess of possible NORAD reactiontime and, even more so, why would they have Flight 77 and 93 fly way out towardsthe Midwest before turning around and heading all the way back towardsWashington? In the case of Flight 77 it meant that they had to fly forforty-five minutes from the time the plane was known to be hijacked to themoment it is alleged to have struck the Pentagon. Lest we forget, the plane, weare told, took off from Washington, flew forty-five minutes into mid-America andthen flew all the way back to attack its target in … Washington. All this when asurf of the Internet would locate the NORAD reaction procedure and the would-beterrorists would realise that, in normal circumstances, they would have beenintercepted long before they got back to where they started. The official storyof why the response was so slow and ineffective is full of the most blatant liesand contradictions, because it has to be. It is a cover story and not the truth.When one lie falls, another one followsMost people don’t realise that the official account claiming that jets werelaunched in response to the hijackings only emerged a week after the attacks. Upto that point they were saying there was no response before the Pentagon washit. On September 13th, General Richard Myers, the former head of NORAD andacting head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 9/11, was asked at a hearing onCapitol Hill when the order was given to scramble jets in response. This was hisreply: ‘That order, to the best of my knowledge, was after the Pentagon wasstruck’. I know it’s a shocker to think that two days after the biggestterrorist attack on American soil the uniformed head of the military could bereplying to the most basic of questions ‘to the best of my knowledge’, butthat’s what he said. The official position was that no Air Force jets werelaunched until after the Twin Towers and the Pentagon had been hit. This was astaggering admission given what normally happens more than a hundred times ayear in similar circumstances. Why, on this day of all days, was there noreaction? On September 14th, twenty-four hours after Myers spoke on CapitolHill, Dan Rather and CBS News ran a story claiming that NORAD jets werescrambled to New York from the Otis Air National Guard Base at Cape Cod,Massachusetts, in response to Flight 11; and from the (CIA) Air Force Base atLangley, Virginia, to intercept Flight 77 heading for Washington. But botharrived too late. On September 14/15th, a Boston Globe reporter, noting thecontradicting accounts, asked NORAD if the CBS report was true. Once again, theydenied that jets had been scrambled before the Pentagon was hit. Then, out ofnowhere late on September 18th – a week after the attacks – NORAD issued a pressrelease saying that jets were indeed launched in line with the CBS report. What?All this is clearly crazy, but there was a mad panic going on to head offquestions about the lack of response and why. This September 18th version becamethe official story, unquestioned by the pathetic mainstream media, who justrepeat it like the performing parrots that most of them are. I researched thebackground to 9/11 full-time for a year, from immediately after the attacksuntil Alice in Wonderland was published, and I have continued to follow andupdate my knowledge ever since as new revelations come to light. What isabsolutely clear is that there was an inexplicable delay by thegovernment-controlled Federal Aviation Administration in alerting NORAD andasking for support once contact with the planes was lost.The official timelineWhen you look at the official timeline given to me by NORAD, and confirmed to meby the FAA, the delays were extraordinary and against all regulations. Thesummary I will outline here is based on this NORAD timeline. The aircraftinvolved were American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 due to leave BostonLogan Airport for Los Angeles at 7.45 am, but which actually took off at around8 am; United Airlines Flight 175, a 767 that left Boston for Los Angeles at 8.14am; American Airlines Flight 77, a 757 that departed Washington Dulles, also forLos Angeles, at 8.20 am; and United Airlines Flight 93, a 757 that took off fromNewark, New Jersey, at 8.42 am, after a forty-one minute delay. It was headingfor San Francisco. All had remarkably light passenger loads. They had a totalcapacity of 762 passengers, yet the number officially on board on those planeswas less than 270, including all the crews. They were 70 per cent empty. Morethan that, the official list of those who died included only 229 people. Whathappened to the others? None of the names on the released passenger lists wasArabic and so they did not include those named by the FBI as hijackers.Flight 11Image [../Images/00175.jpg]At 8.14 am, air traffic control at Boston lost contact with the pilot of Flight11, and at 8.20 the plane’s transponder was turned off. The transpondertransmits information that makes it easy to identify on the radar screens, butit can still be tracked by conventional radar technology, albeit with lessinformation. The most critical effect of a transponder going down is the loss ofthe plane’s altitude reading, which is potentially catastrophic in the skies ofthe northeast United States, the busiest airspace in the world. At 8.21 and8.22, according to the official story, fight attendants called American Airlinesemployees on the ground to say that the plane was hijacked. At 8.24, it isclaimed that controllers in Boston heard a voice from the cockpit saying: ‘Wehave some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to theairport. Nobody move’. By this time, 8.24, the hijack regulations I havedetailed should have been implemented when it would have been clear there wasbig trouble on Flight 11. But despite losing communication with the plane tenminutes earlier, NORAD was not alerted by the FAA. Other air traffic centreswere told, it seems, but not the Air Force. If fighters from the Otis AirNational Guard Base at Cape Cod had been scrambled at 8.25 while other airtraffic centres were being told – but not NORAD – they would have been able toreach the plane before it threatened the World Trade Center. Fighters at Otisare on twenty-four-hour readiness and a spokesman said they can reach New Yorkin as little as ten minutes. At 8.26, Flight 11 turned sharply and headed southfor New York, passing over the prime target for any serious terrorist with aplane, the three nuclear power stations at Indian Point with its massivestockpiles of nuclear waste. Only at 8.38 did Boston air traffic decide toofficially tell NORAD that Flight 11 had been hijacked, a fact communicated bythe FAA to NORAD at 8.40. This was twenty-four and twenty-six minutes aftercontact was lost with the plane. The regulations say: ‘If … you are in doubtthat a situation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it asthough it were an emergency’. Clearly that did not happen here, according to theofficial timeline of events. At 8.40, two fighter pilots at the Otis base atCape Cod were put on alert, but it was six minutes before they were scrambled.Why? As they were preparing for take off, the North Tower of the World Centerwas hit. The FAA informed NORAD what had happened, but it was ten minutes beforethey told the Otis pilots on their way to New York. The NORAD centre handlingthe response was its Northeast Air Defense Sector, known as ‘NEADS’, located atwhat used to be Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, New York. It reports to theContinental US NORAD Region headquarters at the Tyndall Air Force Base nearPanama City, Florida, which, in turn, reports to NORAD’s Cheyenne Mountainoperational headquarters.Flight 175Image [../Images/00176.jpg]Boston air traffic had earlier asked the pilot of Flight 175 if he could seeFlight 11. He replied that he could and, at 8.41, he reported to New Yorkcontrollers that he heard a strange transmission from the plane as they leftBoston, which said ‘everyone stay in your seats’. But, only thirty secondslater, Flight 175 turned from its scheduled route and headed south with notransponder or communication. Thirty seconds after talking to air traffic withno problems? How could the cockpit be hijacked, the pilots overpowered and theroute changed in half a minute? However, this could be explained if that was themoment that remote control from the ground kicked in through accessing theplane’s computer system. The ‘hack’ would have immediately closed down thecommunications network with air traffic controllers. ‘Flight 175’ smashed intothe South Tower at 9.03, amid a fireball captured by live television activatedby the crash of Flight 11. NORAD said that the Otis fighters were stillseventy-one miles away when the second plane hit, which means they must havebeen flying at less than a quarter of their potential speed. An Otis spokesmanhas said they could get to New York in as little as ten minutes, but it was nowseventeen minutes since they left and they were still seventy-one miles out.Flight 77Image [../Images/00177.jpg]At 8:51 am, American Airlines Flight 77 was in communication with air trafficcontrollers for the last time 285 miles west of Washington. Four minutes laterBarbara Olson, a lawyer and writer well-known for her appearances on CNN, isclaimed to have called her husband, the Bush administration’s Solicitor General,Theodore Olson, at his office in the Justice Department. Theodore Olsen says shetold him the plane had been hijacked by men with box cutters and knives. He saidshe was cut off, but rang back to say they had rounded up passengers at the backof the plane. She asked: ‘What should I tell the pilot to do?’ Once again, allthat Barbara Olsen is supposed to have described in that first call must havehappened in the just four minutes since the last no-problem communication fromthe cockpit to air traffic. In this time, Olsen would have had to understandwhat was going on, make the call, and get through. At 8.56, the transponder wasturned off and, some forty minutes after leaving Washington, it swung around tohead back there. I ask again: Why would terrorists, who knew the normal NORADresponse time and system, board a plane at an airport down the road from theirintended target, then let it fly for forty minutes and hundreds of miles beforelaunching the hijack and flying it all the way back again? Unless those trulybehind these attacks knew the normal response would not be happening that day.The two fighters from Otis were closing in on New York after arriving too latefor the World Trade Center attacks and they could have been over Washington inlittle more than ten minutes – certainly well within the, by then, thirty-fourminutes it would take for Flight 77 to get there. The plane was known to havebeen hijacked and two others had already crashed into the World Trade Center.The urgency of reacting to Flight 77 was obvious, but the Otis jets were notdirected to Washington. Again, why? West Virginia flight control identified aplane flying east with no transponder or radio contact, yet, according to theofficial story, it was another nineteen minutes before NORAD were told, when theFAA at last thought to give them a call at 9.24. This was twenty-nine minutesafter FAA air traffic lost contact with the plane and the transponder wasswitched off. Remember the regulations – this is against all normal procedures.At 9.24, NORAD scrambled fighters from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, 130miles south of Washington, the official version goes, and they took off at 9.30.It seems that, at first, they were inexplicably flying to New York when one ofthem had a call from a member of the Secret Service who said: ‘I want you toprotect the White House at all costs’. They then changed course for Washington.Ugh? At 9.26, it is said that Barbara Olson again called Solicitor General,Theodore Olson, and said the passengers and pilots were being held at the backof the plane. The US air traffic system, and the fantastic tracking andsatellite technology controlled by NORAD from Cheyenne Mountain, is claimed tohave ‘lost’ Flight 77 for nearly forty minutes while it was still trackable byconventional radar. This is simply not credible given the technologicalpotential within Cheyenne Mountain. At 9.33, Washington air traffic control sawa blip moving very fast on the radar and warned Dulles Airport. We are given theimpression that this was the first sighting of Flight 77 since contact was lost,but at 9.25 the FAA had told NORAD that the plane was heading for Washington.The whole story is a maze of contradictions. The plane, or whatever it turns outto be, was lost to radar screens at 9.37 when it smashed into the side of thePentagon – ‘coincidentally’ at the very point where it had recently beenstrengthened to cope with a terrorist attack. It was on the opposite side of theenormous building from where Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the militarytop brass were located. As for the fighters despatched from Langley, it was déjàvu with what had happened in New York. According to NORAD and its timeline, theywere still 105 miles or twelve minutes flying time from Washington at the momentof impact. Taking this back to their time of departure, it means the Langleyjets must have flown at less than 15 per cent of top speed or 215 miles an hour.So what kept them? The alleged diversion from the original New York route wouldnot even begin to account for the time taken to get there. Why, in the light ofunfolding events in New York, weren’t fighters scrambled to defend the capitalimmediately as a matter of course? After all, those involved have constantlysaid: ‘We didn’t know how many other hijacked planes we were dealing with’. Bythe time the Langley F-16s arrived over Washington, their average speed for the130 miles was around 410 miles an hour – 27 per cent of top speed. What the hellwas that all about? As a Newsday report put it: ‘The record suggests thatteenagers on instant-message networks communicate faster than some federalofficials did during the crisis’. And The New York Times said ‘… despiteelaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to control the nation’sairspace in defense of the country, and despite two other jetliners’ havingalready hit the World Trade Center in New York, the fighter planes thatscrambled into protective orbits around Washington did not arrive until 15minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon’.Flight 93Image [../Images/00178.jpg]At 9 am, United Airlines had warned all its pilots in the air about the dangerof ‘cockpit intrusion’ and United Airlines Flight 93 had acknowledged receipt ofthis information while flying over Pennsylvania. But, some time between 9.10 and9.20, the plane was hijacked. The FAA is reported to have informed NORAD ataround 9.20, although, for whatever reason, NORAD has never confirmed that itwas told. No fighter response was ordered, despite what had already happened,the official story tells us. At 9.28, it is claimed that a voice in the cockpitwas heard to say: ‘Get out of here!’ Such a remark must have come from the pilotor crew, but this was eight minutes, possibly eighteen if you go back to 9.10,after the plane is claimed to have been hijacked. Once again, this makes nosense. Arabic voices are said to have been heard talking, yet, as with all theflights, no Arab names appeared on the passenger list issued by the airlines. Aminute after ‘Get out of here’, passenger Jeremy Glick is reported to havecalled his wife and described the hijackers. At 9.35, with the plane 375 milesfrom its departure point at Newark, New Jersey, it made a 135 degree turn nearCleveland, Ohio, and flew in the direction of Washington DC. Five minutes latertransponder contact was lost. It was reported by ABC News that just before theplane changed course ‘someone’ radioed the FAA from the cockpit and asked for aflight plan to Washington. Why would anyone do this, so alerting the authoritiesto their target when none of the other planes did so? If the pilot made thecall, perhaps as a warning, why was he still flying the plane when hijackerswere supposed to have taken over the controls?Other passengers on the plane began to make phone calls from about 9.45, theofficial story tells us. Mark Bingham rang his mother. ‘Mom, this is MarkBingham’, he is claimed to have said, a strange opening line to your own mum. ‘Iwant to let you know that I love you. I’m calling from the plane. We’ve beentaken over. There are three men that say they have a bomb’. Tom Burnett is saidto have called his wife three times and heard about the World Trade Center. Hetold her the hijackers claimed to have a bomb, but he didn’t think it was true.Todd Beamer got through to a Verizon phone company supervisor, the officialversion claims, and said the pilot and co-pilot appeared to be dead. There weretwo hijackers in the cockpit, he said, while another two were guarding firstclass and twenty-seven passengers at the back of the plane. He said that theyhad voted to storm the hijackers and the supervisor said she heard him say ‘Areyou guys ready? Let’s roll’. Another passenger is said to have called 911, theAmerican number for emergencies (no coincidence with the symbolism-obsessedReptilian hybrids), and talked with operator Glen Cramer. He is claimed to havesaid he had locked himself in the toilet and he shouted ‘We’re being hijacked,we’re being hijacked’. He spoke of hearing an explosion and saw white smokecoming from the plane, we are told. All this is very strange. If hijackers wereguarding passengers in first class and at the back of the plane, as ‘Beamer’said, how come this guy could lock himself in the toilet? And would his cellphone really work in such circumstances tens of thousands of feet above groundin a tiny toilet?According to the FBI, Flight 93 ‘crashed’ at about 10.03 am near Shanksville,Pennsylvania, some eighty miles southeast of Pittsburgh, although other reportssay it was a few minutes later. A small white plane, said to look like a fighterjet, was seen circling the area at the same time. Five residents near the crashsite reported seeing this second white plane flying erratically minutes after itis claimed that Flight 93 went down. Susan Mcelwain from Stonycreek Townshipsaid a small unmarked white jet with rear engines came in low over her vehiclebefore disappearing over the top of a hill, almost clipping trees. This ishardly an experience she could have imagined. Less than a minute later, shesaid, the ground shook. Dennis Decker and Rick Chaney heard the explosion andran outside to see a mushroom cloud. ‘As soon as we looked up, we saw a midsizedjet flying low and fast’, said Decker. ‘It appeared to make a loop or part of acircle and then it turned fast and headed out.’ Both men said it looked like awhite Learjet-type plane with the engines at the rear. ‘If you were here to seeit, you’d have no doubt’, Decker said. ‘It was a jet plane and it had to beflying real close when that 757 went down. If I was the FBI, I’d find out whowas driving that plane.’ FBI Special Agent William Crowley at first said theycould not rule out that a second plane had been nearby, but later retracted thestatement. The Cleveland Air Traffic Control Center in Overland, Ohio, trackedFlight 93 and an official was asked if there was any record of a second plane.His only reply was ‘no comment’. If there was no second plane, what was wrongwith ‘no’?A seismologist has said there was a sonic boom in Western Pennsylvania at 9.22,which might have been a fighter tracking Flight 93. The F-16s from Langley couldhave been re-directed to intercept the plane, but we are told this didn’thappen. Instead, at 10.01 am in the official timeline, F-16s were scrambled fromToledo, Ohio, in pursuit of Flight 93. Even though the base was not ontwenty-four-hour stand-by, the fighters were airborne in sixteen minutes, but,here we go again, they arrived ten minutes after Flight 93 crashed inPennsylvania – or so we are told. However, a New Hampshire air trafficcontroller ignored the ban on controllers speaking publicly, and said that ‘anF-16 fighter closely pursued Flight 93 ... the F-16 made 360-degree turns toremain close to the commercial jet’, the controller said. ‘He must’ve seen thewhole thing.’ Ernie Stuhl, the Mayor of Shanksville, said he knew of two peoplewho said they heard a missile. ‘They both live very close, within a couple ofhundred yards’, he said. ‘This one fellow’s served in Vietnam and he says he’sheard them, and he heard one that day’. From what he had gathered, the F-16swere ‘very, very close’. Several witnesses report hearing a bang before Flight93 began to fly erratically, but General Richard Myers, the acting Chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff on 9/11, has, like all the official storytellers,insisted that Flight 93 was not shot down. The official story is that it crashedafter passengers stormed the cockpit in the ‘let’s roll’ scenario.All our planes are missing …Now here are a few questions. There are air bases right across the UnitedStates. Why weren’t they all put on alert when Flight 11 and, shortlyafterwards, Flight 175 hit the World Trade Center? Why were planes scrambledfrom locations further away when there were bases much closer to events? Whyweren’t military jets sent up from these closer bases to tail the hijackedplanes and provide information to ground control – as per regulations and whathappens every other day as a matter of course? While fighters were activated –so belatedly – from Langley, Virginia, in response to Flight 77, there werefighter planes on the tarmac just ten miles from the Pentagon at the Andrews AirForce Base in Camp Springs, Maryland, the home of the presidential jumbo, AirForce One (Figure 170). Why weren’t planes airborne immediately from Andrews toprotect the skies over Washington – especially when it was known that Flight 77had been hijacked and was heading there? NORAD said that it only used bases inits own network, which numbered just seven in the whole country. This isnonsense. If fighters from the non-NORAD base at Toledo could be sent in pursuitof Flight 93, as claimed, then why couldn’t the same happen with Andrews AirForce Base? Are we really supposed to believe that the airbase that protectsWashington does not have fighters on stand-by when it is home to thepresidential plane, has top foreign dignitaries passing through all the time,and when there is a no-fly zone over Washington that has to be policed? Eventhough the Toledo fighters were not on twenty-four-hour stand-by, they werestill in the air within sixteen minutes. But from Andrews … nothing. Apparently,three F-16s from Andrews were on an exercise mission in North Carolina 207 milesaway, and it was only when they were half way back that they were told to returnas fast as they could fly. But there are more than three fighters at Andrews andthere is no way they would not have had some ready to scramble. I was incorrespondence with NORAD and the FAA in my research for Alice in Wonderland andthe World Trade Center Disaster and I asked them both who policed the Washingtonno-fly zone and from where. Neither would answer me in any detail. NORAD saidthis was done by the ‘civilian authority’ – the FAA – and the FAA said the zonewas policed ‘as appropriate’. Well, let me give their memories a nudge here. Youpolice the Washington no-fly zone from Andrews Air Force Base, remember? As theAssociated Press reported on November 11th, 2003:> It happens all the time. When a small private plane recently entered the> 23-mile restricted ring around the US Capitol, two F-16 interceptors were> immediately launched from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away. In a> similar episode, a pair of F-16 ‘Fighting Falcons’ on 15-minute strip alert> was airborne from Andrews just 11 minutes after being notified by the North> American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) of a Cessna straying towards the> White House. Image [../Images/00179.jpg]Figure 170: Andrews Air Force Base is only ten miles from the Pentagon and it isfrom here that the no-fly zone over Washington DC is policed. So why no responsefrom Andrews on 9/11 until the Pentagon was hit? This was also the case before 9/11, of course it was. Does anyone really believethat the Washington no-fly zone was defended from Langley 130 miles away, orfrom Otis in Cape Cod, Massachusetts? That’s insane. What would be the point ofhaving such a zone if that were the case? The media actually reported that oncethe Pentagon was hit on 9/11 fighters from Andrews were ordered to protect theskies over the capital! After it was hit. The Washington DC Air National Guardis located at Andrews and this is what it said on its own website before 9/11,when the website went down for days:> We are home to the 113th wing: the 121st fighter squadron (including F-15> Fighting Falcons) … The DC Air National Guard … stand ready to respond to the> needs of the District of Columbia – and the nation should the need arise. Except on September 11th. A former Pentagon air traffic controller said:> All those years ago when I was at the Pentagon, this wouldn’t have happened.> [Air Traffic Control] Radar images were (and are) available in the> understructures of the Pentagon, and any commercial flight within 300 miles of> DC that made an abrupt course change toward Washington, or turned off their> transponder and refused to communicate with [Air Traffic Control], would have> been intercepted at supersonic speeds within minutes by fighters out of> Andrews AFB. Why there were no fighters from Andrews AFB baffles me. If we> could get fighters notified, scrambled, and airborne within about 6 minutes> from Andrews AFB then, we could now. They could have been, indeed were after the Pentagon was hit. It didn’t happenearlier because it wasn’t meant to.Another extraordinary ‘coincidence’What are the chances on this of all days that a series of ‘training exercises’were happening in the same airspace at the same time as the 9/11 hijackings? Andthat some of these ‘exercises’ involved hijacked planes flown into a building?This meant that the radar screens were peppered with ‘hijacked planes’, somereal and many simulated, which confused the system that morning – as planned. Asa NORAD operative was heard to say when told of Flight 11: ‘Is this real worldor exercise?’ There were many exercises happening that day and one included thescenario of a hijacked aircraft being flown into a building in Washington DC.The exercises we now know about were called Global Guardian, Vigilant Guardian,Operation Northern Vigilance, Operation Northern Guardian, Operation VigilantWarrior and Tripod II – and there could have been others. These also had theeffect of relocating fighter planes to Alaska and Canada that would normally bedefending the east coast. Two F-16s from the Air National Guard’s 177th FighterWing at Atlantic City International Airport would otherwise have beenscramble-ready just eight minutes flying time to New York, and would havecomfortably intercepted the World Trade Center aircraft. Instead, they weretaking part in an exercise. General Eberhart, the commander of NORAD, said: ‘Ittook about thirty seconds to make the adjustment to the real-world situation’,but this was clearly a ridiculous statement. Operation Vigilant Guardianinvolved the simulation of hijacked planes in the 9/11 airspace and wassupervised by NORAD’s Lieutenant Colonel Dawne Deskins, the airborne and warningofficer. When she was called by Boston air traffic control about the hijackingof Flight 11, the Newhouse News Service reported her as saying: ‘It must be partof the exercise’. FAA and military officials had difficulty discerning the wargame operations from the actual attacks – as they were meant to. These includedNORAD’s General Larry Arnold and NEADS Commander, Colonel Robert K. Marr Jr.Lieutenant Colonel Deskins said ‘everybody’ at NEADS, the Northeast Air DefenseSector of NORAD, thought at first that the attacks were part of VigilantGuardian. Who was in charge of these wargame exercises that confused theresponse system on 9/11? Well, well, well: Dick Cheney.Dick’s fairytaleCheney was given control of all such operations just four months before theattacks in a presidential executive order in May 2001. An executive order is asystem by which the President decrees law without the complication of a vote ordebate. Vice-President Cheney is a brutal and deeply imbalanced man. Hiscomputer program must have been written by a sadist. Cheney, who has been thereal power in the White House, told the media on September 12th, 2001 that heonly heard of the 9/11 attacks from a clerical secretary who was watchingtelevision in his Washington office. Liar, liar, liar. He said the SecretService took him to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, an undergroundbunker at the White House, and he began to direct the response – or lack of it –to what was happening. It was no accident that it was arranged for Bush to beout of the way at a school in Florida and then to be flown to military basesuntil the evening. He is only a figurehead president and he would have got inthe way. Go fetch the tea, George – Dick is thirsty. It was in that White Houseoperations ‘bunker’ that the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta,witnessed a highly significant exchange. He described what happened before thePentagon was hit in evidence to the 9/11 Commission that ‘investigated’ theattacks:> During the time that the airplane was coming in to the Pentagon, there was a> young man who would come in and say to the Vice-President, ‘The plane is 50> miles out, the plane is 30 miles out’. And when it got down to ‘the plane is> 10 miles out’, the young man also said to the Vice-President, ‘Do the orders> still stand?’ And the Vice-President turned and whipped his neck around and> said, ‘Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the> contrary?’ Here is devastating evidence from a member of the Bush–Cheney administrationconfirming that they were tracking Flight 77, or whatever hit the Pentagon, allthe way into Washington, while the official story claims that air trafficcontrollers and NORAD had ‘lost’ the aircraft until just before impact. Therewere two levels of tracking going on all the time. One was the day-to-dayoperational staff at NORAD’s NEADS operation in New York and the FAA, who werethwarted and confused at every turn, not least by the exercises; and the otherwas the one Cheney, NORAD chiefs at Cheyenne Mountain and the Pentagon top brasswere operating. They were tracking all the planes all the time and directingevents. The evidence presented by Norman Mineta also has the ‘young man’ askingCheney if ‘the orders still stand’, as the plane hurtles towards Washington withCheney replying: ‘Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything tothe contrary?’ So, what orders were these then? Mineta indicated that he didn’tknow what the orders referred to, but appeared to take this to mean they were toshoot down the plane. This makes no sense at all, because, despite the obviouslydetailed tracking that was going on, the plane or projectile was not shot downbefore it struck the Pentagon. The only explanation that makes sense, not onlyof this, but other events that day, is that the orders were not to shoot downthe plane. No wonder the ‘young man’ sounded so anxious and wanted moreconfirmation.Where were the ground-to-air defences?The White House and the Pentagon are defended by ground-to-air missile systems –of course they are. Even at the G-8 Summit in Genoa, Italy, in July 2001airspace was closed over the city and defended with ground-to-air missiles, yetWashington would not be? I was shown around the parliament building in Canberra,Australia, by a man who worked with the nation’s air-defence computer system. Heshowed me the hidden positions around the building where the ground-to-airmissiles are located. He said that when a plane enters the restricted airspaceover the Australian capital the computer system demands that the pilot tap in afour-digit code that gives him permission to be there. If this is not donequickly missiles automatically launch, I was told. This is what happens inCanberra, but the same or better technology is not in place at the Pentagon andWhite House? Why was it not activated on 9/11? My Australian contact said heknew for a fact that the Pentagon, and Washington in general, are defended by aneven more sophisticated missile system than Canberra, but it works in basicallythe same way. It is obvious that this would be the case and it has been openlyaccepted that a ground-to-air system is in place to defend the White House. TheGlobe and Mail newspaper in Canada provided one of the rare mentions of thePentagon system. It reported:> Meanwhile, there was no explanation of how four airliners could be hijacked> and flown – in at least two cases hundreds of kilometres and for nearly an> hour – without being successfully intercepted. That one ploughed into the> Pentagon, supposedly protected by surface-to-air missiles, dramatically> demonstrated US vulnerability. Why weren’t those missiles launched to stop the Pentagon crash? The same reasonthat the FAA, NORAD and the Defense Department did not scramble fighter jets, orat least not in time. They weren’t meant to.The NORAD tapesThe official 9/11 Commission ‘investigation’ was established to hide the truthof what happened, as I will outline later, but it did subpoena what are claimedto be audiotapes of exchanges between the control room of NORAD’s Northeast AirDefense Sector, or ‘NEADS’, and the FAA air traffic control system. If they areaccurate they expose more fantastic lies to those who have studied thebackground to 9/11, and many of those involved should be in court for grossnegligence. Are they really an accurate reflection of events? With the 9/11cover-up, nothing should be taken for granted, though they do make sense withinthe overall story of what happened that day. The tapes came from the NEADS endof the conversations, but had apparently been simultaneously recorded by theFAA. What they claim to record, destroys the official NORAD version that wasfirst issued on September 18th 2001 and even repeated to the Commission beforethe tapes came to light in 2004. They suggest that NEADS was not told of thehijacking of Flight 77 (Pentagon) until just before impact and Flight 93(Pennsylvania) until after it crashed. They reveal that the fighters had beenscrambled from Langley, Virginia, not in response to Flight 77, but to a falsereport that Flight 11 had passed over New York and was heading for Washington.The official story had claimed that Air Force jets were tracking Flight 93 andcould have shot it down if the order had come, but the version on the tapes isvery different.It is claimed that American Airlines refused to confirm for several hours thatits plane, Flight 11, had hit the World Trade Center which, according to ColinScoggins the manager at Boston air traffic control, caused confusion as theattacks continued. At 8.57 am, Flight 175 veered off course near Allentown,Pennsylvania, and headed for New York. On the tapes, air traffic controllers atthe New York Center speculated on its target – maybe the Statue of Liberty – andone calls out the plane’s rate of descent every twelve seconds as the radarrefreshes. But, they didn’t alert the NEADS centre of NORAD until seconds fromimpact. Flight 175, or at least a large plane, struck the South Tower at 9.03.The NEADS operations centre was told by Colin Scoggins at Boston air trafficcontrol of another hijacked plane heading for Washington at 9.21 am, accordingto the tapes, but this alert is not mentioned in the official version of events.Even more bizarre, Scroggins was not talking about Flight 77, which took offfrom Washington Dulles an hour earlier. He said that American Airlines Flight 11had not hit the World Trade Center and was now heading for Washington. Scrogginstold Vanity Fair magazine: ‘When we phoned United [after the second tower washit], they confirmed that United 175 was down, and I think they confirmed thatwithin two or three minutes. With American Airlines, we could never confirm ifit was down or not, so that left doubt in our minds.’ The report of the ‘PhantomFlight 11’ turned out to be nonsense and they weren’t even tracking a planeheading for Washington at the time; it was all supposition. The tapes revealthat NEADS wanted to direct more jets to protect New York airspace to join thetwo from Otis that had arrived too late, but the FAA, which has the final saywhen civilian airspace is involved, refused. The excuse was that it would putcivilian aircraft in danger in crowded airspace, but clearly they already were.Sometime shortly after 9.21, fighters were directed to Washington from Langley,Virginia, but in the Commission version they didn’t head for the capital at all.They flew east into the Atlantic, because as one pilot said: ‘No one told us whywe were being scrambled’! The 9/11 Commission heard that the Langley pilots werenot told what was happening, and assumed they were scrambled to protect theAmerican mainland from attack from the east in line with the procedure since theCold War with the Soviet Union. ‘I reverted to the Russian threat – I’m thinkingcruise-missile threat from the sea’, a pilot told the Commission. The Otispilots said that they were similarly kept in the dark about much of what washappening, including the crash of Flight 175. Back at NEADS, Staff SergeantWilliam Huckabone saw that the Langley jets were going the wrong way, the tapesclaim, and at 9.34 am this exchange took place involving him, Master SergeantSteve Citino, and Naval air traffic control, or ‘ATC’:> 9:34:12> NAVY ATC: You’ve got [the fighters] moving east in airspace. Now you want ‘em> to go to Baltimore [Washington]?> HUCKABONE: Yes, sir. We’re not gonna take ‘em in Whiskey 386 [military> training airspace over the ocean].> NAVY ATC: Okay, once he goes to Baltimore, what are we supposed to do?> HUCKABONE: Have him contact us on auxiliary frequency 2-3-4 decimal 6. Instead> of taking handoffs to us and us handing ‘em back, just tell Center they’ve got> to go to Baltimore.> NAVY ATC: All right, man. Stand by. We’ll get back to you.> CITINO: What do you mean, ‘We’ll get back to you’? Just do it! HUCKABONE: I’m> gonna choke that guy!Meanwhile, Tech Sergeant Shelley Watson was frantically ringing all possiblesources to establish the position of the long-crashed Flight 11, the tapessuggest, and when she contacted Washington Center air traffic at 9.34 theoperations manager told her that Flight 11 was lost. Why had no one told NEADS?At this same time, Cheney was in his White House bunker getting a constantcountdown of Flight 77 closing in on Washington. On one section of the NORADtapes this exchange can be heard with Washington Air Traffic Control:> 9:34:01> WASHINGTON CENTER: Now, let me tell you this. I – I’ll – we’ve been looking.> We’ve also lost American 77.> WATSON: American 77?> DOOLEY: American 77’s lost.> WATSON: Where was it proposed to head, sir?> WASHINGTON CENTER: Okay, he was going to LA also.> WATSON: From where, sir?> WASHINGTON CENTER: I think he was from Boston also [it was actually Washington> Dulles]. Now let me tell you this story here. Indianapolis Center was working> this guy.> WATSON: What guy?> WASHINGTON CENTER: American 77, at flight level 3-5-0 [35,000 feet]. However,> they lost radar with him. They lost contact with him. They lost everything.> And they don’t have any idea where he is or what happened.It was forty minutes before this conversation, at 8.54 am, that Indianapoliscontrollers had lost radar contact with American 77 and, in line withregulations, told their superiors at the FAA that the plane was probablyhijacked. But, if these tapes are true, no one at the FAA told the military andonly by chance did Tech Sergeant Shelley Watson find out from Washington AirTraffic Control. At 9.35, Colin Scoggins at the FAA’s Boston Center told NEADSthat they had a report of a low-flying aircraft six miles southeast of the WhiteHouse, but ‘moving away’. This was the alleged Flight 77. The following exchangeinvolves Major Kevin Nasypany, the NEADS mission crew commander, and keep inmind that Cheney in his White House command bunker was hearing Flight 77 countedin from fifty miles, thirty miles, etc.:> 9:36:23> NASYPANY: Okay, Foxy [Major Fox, the Weapons Team head]. I got an aircraft six> miles east of the White House! Get your fighters there as soon as possible!> MALE VOICE: That came from Boston?> HUCKABONE: We’re gonna turn and burn it – crank it up.> MALE TECH: Six miles!> HUCKABONE: All right, here we go. This is what we’re gonna do …> NASYPANY: We’ve got an aircraft deviating eight miles east of the White House> right now.> FOX: Do you want us to declare A.F.I.O. [emergency military control of the> fighters] and run ‘em straight in there?> NASYPANY: Take ‘em and run ‘em to the White House.> FOX: Go directly to Washington.> CITINO: We’re going direct DC with my guys [Langley fighters]? Okay. Okay.> HUCKABONE: Ma’am, we are going A.F.I.O. right now with Quit 2-5 [the Langley> fighters]. They are going direct Washington.> NAVY A.T.C.: Quit 2-5, we’re handing ‘em off to Center right now.> HUCKABONE: Ma’am, we need to expedite that right now. We’ve gotta contact them> on 2-3-4-6.They thought the White House was under threat, but it turned out to be thePentagon. One of the NEADS staff spotted the plane, or whatever it was, onradar:> 9:37:56> MALE TECH: Right here, right here, right here. I got him. I got him.> NASYPANY: We just lost track. Get a Z-point [coordinate] on that … Okay, we> got guys lookin’ at ‘em. Hold on … Where’s Langley at? Where are the fighters?The answer was that they were 150 miles away after being allowed, through lackof information, to fly in the opposite direction out into the ocean, accordingto these tapes. This would explain why they took so long and why their averagespeed from take off to arrival in Washington appeared to be so pedestrian. At9.38 the Pentagon was struck, twenty minutes before the Langley planes arrived.Immediately after the Pentagon crash, Colin Scroggins at Boston air trafficcalled with yet another false alarm, a Boston plane heading for Las Vegas. Then,at 10.07 am, came a call from Cleveland air traffic control in Ohio:> 10:07:16> CLEVELAND CENTER: We got a United 93 out here. Are you aware of that?> WATSON: United 93?> CLEVELAND CENTER: That has a bomb on board.> WATSON: A bomb on board?! And this is confirmed? You have a [beacon code],> sir?> CLEVELAND CENTER: No, we lost his transponder.Four minutes before this conversation took place, the tapes suggest, the planehad already crashed in Pennsylvania at 10.03. It was thirty-five minutes earlierthat John Werth, a Cleveland air traffic controller of long experience, hadheard suspicious noises from the cockpit and believed it had been hijacked. Itwas, by now, a familiar tale. Werth had reported his suspicions through the FAAchain of command, as per regulations, but they did not pass this information tothe NEADS centre until the plane and its passengers and crew were already nomore, if the tapes are accurate. This happened despite the fact that two planeshad hit the World Trade Center before John Werth’s report, and the Pentagon wasalso hit some twenty-five minutes before Cleveland air traffic informed NEADSabout Flight 93. The head of FAA security on 9/11 was Major General MichaelCanavan. His title was Director of Civil Aviation Security for the FAA and,according to the 9/11 Commission report, the hijack coordinator on September11th was the ‘Director of the FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security, or his orher designate’. That was Major General Canavan or whoever he designated. I askedthe FAA who the hijack coordinator was that day, but they didn’t reply. Canavanis reported to have been in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that morning and headed forWashington by military jet. So who was his designate as FAA hijack coordinatorand why are we not being told given the importance of this position that day?Look again at the official hijack regulations with regard to the FAA alertingthe military:> The escort service will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct> contact with the National Military Command Center (NMCC) [based at the> Pentagon]. The Defense Department (DOD) manual covering plane hijackings says:> In the event of a hijacking, the NMCC will be notified by the most expeditious> means by the FAA. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses …> forward requests for DOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval. Why didn’t this happen? Where was the ‘hijack coordinator’, who was the ‘hijackcoordinator’, when air traffic controllers were reporting suspicious planes andpassing this information up the FAA chain of command, while NORAD operatives atthe NEADS response centre were not being told until it was too late? Why wasn’tCanavan publicly questioned on this obvious issue by the 9/11 Commission?Canavan has a considerable background in US Special Operations, which, accordingto the Department of Defense’s Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, aredefined as: ‘Operations conducted by specially organized, trained, and equippedmilitary and paramilitary forces to achieve military, political, economic orpsychological objectives by unconventional means in hostile, denied orpolitically sensitive areas’. In short: operations that are above the law andoff the record. Canavan was Commanding General, Special Operations Command,Europe, and Commanding General, Joint Special Operations Command, at Fort Bragg,North Carolina. He had also been involved with the plan by the elite DeltaForces to capture Osama bin Laden. Canavan, a one-time Chief of Staff of the USEuropean Command in Stuttgart, Germany, became FAA Director of Security inJanuary 2000, the month Bush was sworn in as president, and announced hisdeparture less than a month after September 11th. I am not pointing the fingerat Canavan and saying he was involved because I don’t know that, but I am sayingthat there are questions he needs to answer about (a) who was the FAA hijackcoordinator that day, and (b) why was the FAA response such a shambles.The ‘NORAD tapes’ subpoenaed by the 9/11 Commission provide far more questionsthan answers. Why would NORAD issue a false timeline in September 2001 thatposed so many questions about its lack of response and competence when thetapes’ timeline heaps the blame on the FAA? Why would NORAD officers repeat thesame story to the Commission right up to the tapes coming to light and openthemselves to accusations of deliberately misleading the inquiry? One NORADofficer, General Larry Arnold, confused matters even more when he told theCommission: ‘We launched the aircraft out of Langley to put them over top ofWashington DC, not in response to American Airlines 77, but really to put themin position in case United 93 were to head that way’. Where the heck did thatcome from? The official story is a mass of contradiction and confusion, added toby the ‘NORAD tapes’ played to the 9/11 Commission. Ah, yes, confusion. This isone of the greatest weapons of the manipulator. Apparent chaos is wonderfulcamouflage for calculation. As I’ve said, there were two communication networksoperating on 9/11. One involved the ‘people on the ground’, the operatives atthe air traffic centers and those at NEADS. These communications weresystematically disrupted and sabotaged by those working for the othercommunications network that day. This was the one involving the Joint Chiefs ofStaff Command Center in the Pentagon, the highest level of NORAD and associatedagencies at Cheyenne Mountain, and involved Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz.Indeed, something similar was planned in the 1960s by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,as I will show. This second network, operating to its pre-arranged plan, hadaccess to the state-of-the-art technology in Cheyenne Mountain while NEADS werekept in the dark about what was going on and were trying to make sense of whatwas happening amid, among other things, Pentagon wargames that also involvedsimulated hijackings. These wargames were under the ultimate authority of DickCheney. It was this Cheney–Pentagon– NORAD network that was orchestrating theattacks, by the methods I will come to shortly, and sabotaging the normal speedand efficiency of response. Some researchers have confused the more basic NEADSoperation in New York with NORAD’s operational headquarters in CheyenneMountain, where incredible tracking technology exists, much of it not known tothe public arena. Its official website says of the Command Center there:> Redundant and survivable communications hotlines connect the Command Center to> the Pentagon, White House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters> in Ottawa, other aerospace defense system command posts, and major military> centers around the world. This was the communication system used to control events on 9/11. I saw oneinvestigative website that claimed to have conducted a phone interview, onDecember 9th 2001, with a member of the US Air Force based in New York. It wassaid that this source was ordered to the crash sites in New York, Pennsylvaniaand the Pentagon within days of 9/11 as part of an Air Force investigation. Whathe and others discovered, the website claims he told them, was that the standardresponse procedures were fully in effect that morning and were followed to theletter as usual by air traffic control. Air National Guard and Air Force unitswere alerted immediately it was clear that something was amiss with the fouraircraft, but he said that after these alerts and requests for action werereceived from air traffic control and the FAA, orders from the ‘highest level ofthe executive branch of the federal government were received, demanding that theAir Force stand down and not follow through with established scramble-interceptprocedures that morning until further notice’. This would make sense of Cheneyand his statement that the ‘orders still stand’. The Air Force contact wasunnamed, but then, to be fair, how could he have been? People will just have todecide for themselves if what he is claimed to have said rings true. Thisscenario certainly fits what happened that morning and explains the apparentlynonsensical lack of response. No planes were scrambled in time to intercept thehijacked planes and no ground-to-air defences were activated to save the livesof those who died inside the Pentagon. Some would call this incompetence, but,staggering as that alone would be, what happened on September 11th is far morethan that. It was calculated mass murder. The first position taken by theauthorities was that there was nothing they could have done. That is what theyreally want you to believe. The second, when that didn’t work, was to let youthink they were incompetent.Both positions are designed to hide the truth that what we are looking at here,amid the explosion of lies and diversions, is not incompetence at all. It wasorchestrated and calculated by forces working through the highest levels of theUnited States government and military to prevent the system from responding asit normally would. It was coldly calculated by the Reptilian hybrids to stopthousands of people going home to their families that September day, because itsuited their sick agenda for the world to watch them die on live television."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 14 Lying for a living > He who is not very strong in memory should not meddle with lying > Michel de Montaigne The three top commanders of the United States military on 9/11 wereCommander-in- Chief (God help us) George W. Bush; Defense Secretary DonaldRumsfeld; and acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General RichardMyers, the highest ranked uniform that day. He would be confirmed as thefully-fledged chairman two days later to replace General Hugh Shelton, who wasflying abroad on September 11th.Image [../Images/00180.jpg]Figure 171: General Richard Myers, acting head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff onSeptember 11th Their movements that day, and their ludicrous cover stories, are devastatingconfirmation that the attacks were orchestrated from inside the United States bythe very people who have used them to justify the ‘war on terror’ and theirOrwellian controls and surveillance. Richard Myers (Figure 171) was a formerhead of NORAD and would have known the response procedures as well as anyone. Sowhere was Myers while all hell was breaking loose? He claims that he was havinga meeting on Capitol Hill with Senator Max Cleland of Georgia and he didn’t knowabout the attacks because nobody told him! We will see shortly that this is ablatant lie. Here is Myers’ account of his movements that morning, as describedin an interview with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service:> I remember it was like watching a bad movie. I was on Capitol Hill. I was> about ready to meet with Senator Cleland. I was meeting with him in> preparation for my hearing, my confirmation hearing to be the Chairman of the> Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I remember before we walked in there was a TV that> was playing and somebody has said, ‘An airplane has hit one of the World Trade> Center towers’. They thought it was an airplane, and they thought it was a> small airplane or something like that. So we walked in and we did the office> call with Senator Cleland. The highest-ranking uniformed officer in the US military on American soil thatday hears that a plane has hit the World Trade Center and instead of checking itout he goes into a routine meeting with a senator about confirmation hearings?Come again? He added:> Sometime during that office call the second tower was hit. Nobody informed us> of that. But when we came out, that was obvious. Then right at that time> somebody said the Pentagon has been hit. Hold on, let me sit down here, I’m feeling light-headed. No one informed theacting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top military man in Americathat day, when a second airliner hit the World Trade Center while, down inFlorida, the White House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, was telling PresidentBush, according to the official story, that ‘America is under attack’? Do theyreally think we are all so stupid that we would believe that the acting Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff is not contactable at all times and that he wouldnot have been told of the second plane – indeed the first also – as a matter ofcourse by the Pentagon? If he wasn’t, why the hell not? Myers then says that‘right at the time’ he and Cleland came out of their meeting ‘somebody said thePentagon has been hit’. We can, therefore, add a timeline to his story. Myers’account puts him in the meeting with Cleland at no later than around 9 am,before the second plane crashed, and he didn’t come out until the Pentagon washit – that’s no earlier than 9.38. How amazing that this meeting is supposed tohave taken place across precisely the time that the attacks were happening. TheNew York Times tells us that ‘during the hour or so that American AirlinesFlight 77 was under the control of hijackers, up to the moment it struck thewest side of the Pentagon, military officials in a command center on the eastside of the building were urgently talking to law enforcement and air trafficcontrol officials about what to do’. All this was happening and they didn’tinform their ultimate boss that day who was in a meeting down the street onCapitol Hill? General Myers says that when he emerged from the meeting to betold what most of the world already knew, he launched into action:> Immediately, somebody handed me a cell phone, and it was General Eberhart [the> NORAD commander] out at NORAD in Colorado Springs talking about what was> happening and the actions he was going to take. We immediately, after talking> to him, jumped in the car, ran back to the Pentagon. I have detailed the state-of-the-art technology and communications network atthe disposal of NORAD and the Pentagon, yet NORAD contacted the acting militaryhead of US armed forces only after three planes had crashed over nearly an hour,and when somebody handed him a cell phone? NORAD commander General Eberhart –the man who replaced Myers at Cheyenne Mountain – then told him the actions hewas going to take after three airliners (or whatever hit the Pentagon) wereembedded in three of America’s biggest buildings and 3,000 people were dead?What in God’s name had Eberhart and his NORAD operation been doing all thistime? General Myers also told Armed Forces Radio and Television:> The Chairman [General Shelton] had left that morning to go to Europe, so he> was somewhere over the Atlantic. As I got to the Pentagon, I noticed a lot of> people were coming out … Of course they’d been told to evacuate. My concern> was where can you best discharge your duties? … [My] battle station was in the> National Military Command Center. I asked if it was still running, they said> it sure is, so I went back in the building to the Command Center and was> joined shortly thereafter by the Secretary of Defense. The Deputy Secretary> [Paul Wolfowitz] actually went to another location at that point. We did what> had to be done in terms of the command and control of the day … The interviewer asked Myers if he could believe that it was actually a terroristattack:> I didn’t know what to believe at the time. That was the problem. We had these> events, and then subsequently the airplane went down in Pennsylvania. We were> trying to tie this together, what does this mean? General Eberhart was working> with the Federal aviation agency trying to figure out the logical steps at> this point. We had some fighters airborne at that time in case we had some> hijacked airplanes that were possibly a threat to other institutions or> structures, but it was initially pretty confusing. You hate to admit it, but> we hadn’t thought about this. Hadn’t thought about it? They were having exercises that very morning about thisvery thing! On October 24th 2000, a mass casualty emergency drill was alsoconducted to test the Pentagon’s response to an airliner crashing into itsbuilding. But then, Myers is the man who said he didn’t know if the FAA, FBI orany other agency had contacted the Pentagon after the World Trade Center attacksand before the Pentagon was hit. In fact, there were open lines between thefront-line agencies and the Pentagon, including the FAA, as Myers well knew. Healso knew that the Defense Department, NORAD and the FAA work closely in hijacksituations and that the Pentagon should have been notified before the firstplane crashed, never mind after the first two had done so. He knew that fightersare deployed all the time to seek out rogue aircraft. Myers is a bloody liar andwhat do people lie for? To cover up the truth. The official story claims thathijackers’ voices were heard on cockpit radios and that passengers andattendants called from the planes on cell phones and airphones. Yet, here wasMyers saying they didn’t know if this was a ‘terrorist attack’. What anunbelievable misrepresentation of events. He says that only with three planesdown, thousands dead and a fourth soon to crash in Pennsylvania, did the topmilitary officer on duty that day walk into the command centre at the Pentagonwhich, as we have seen, has clear and set procedures for reacting to hijackingsor aircraft anomalies, and would have had open lines to the FAA and NORADthroughout. Only then, he said, did Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld appear andhe had been in the building close to the command centre from about the time thatFlight 11, the first hijacked plane, was leaving its gate at Boston Logan!General Myers really is something else. You may have seen him giving newsconferences at the Pentagon while his forces bombed innocent civilians inAfghanistan and Iraq. We will see shortly that his 9/11 story is at fundamentalodds with the facts and other people’s experience of where he was that morning.Rumsfeld rumbledDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld (Project for the New American Century) said hewas working on the east side of the Pentagon from about 8 am. He told the CNNtalk show Larry King Live on December 5th 2001 that he was in his office and wasgiven no warning whatsoever that Flight 77 was heading for Washington. The firsthe knew about it, he claims, was when the building was hit. Rumsfeld related toKing that earlier that morning he had told a congressional delegation in hisoffice at the Pentagon:> Sometime in the next two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve months, there would be> an event that would occur in the world that would be sufficiently shocking> that it would remind people, again, how important it is to have a strong,> healthy Defense Department that contributes – that underpins peace and> stability in our world. And that is what underpins peace and stability. How prophetic. He must be psychic or … something. Then came an outrageousstatement that Rumsfeld made to Larry King. He said that during the meeting inhis office:> … someone walked in and handed me a note that said that a plane had just hit> the World Trade Center. And we adjourned the meeting. And I went in to get my> CIA briefing right next door here, and the whole building shook within fifteen> minutes. And it was a jarring thing. Can the official story get any more insane? Unfortunately it can. This is theheadquarters of the US military with open lines to NORAD at Cheyenne Mountainand to all its satellites, AWAC surveillance aircraft and ACS ground-basedsurveillance, and with open lines with the FAA. Two planes had already crashedinto the World Trade Center, Dick Cheney was in the White House command bunkerhaving ‘Flight 77’s’ arrival counted down and the US Defence Secretary says hewas given no warning that an aircraft was heading for Washington or about tocrash into the building that he was in, albeit a long, long, way from impact?This is an extraordinary statement and more blatant nonsense. Larry King failedto ask a single question about the Defense Secretary’s ridiculous story, butthat will surprise no one.We can put a timeline on the Rumsfeld fantasy. The first plane hit the WorldTrade Center at about 8.46 and the Pentagon wasn’t hit until around 9.38. YetRumsfeld tells King he was handed a note saying a plane had ‘just’ hit the WorldTrade Center and within fifteen minutes the Pentagon was struck. We being askedto believe that the Defense Secretary in his office at the heart of the Pentagontop brass, and just two hundred feet from the hijack reaction command centre,wasn’t told about the first plane hitting the World Trade Center until someforty minutes after it happened. This is the only way that the ‘within fifteenminutes’ can be explained. Most of America and hundreds of millions across theworld were watching events unfold live on television before 9 am, but theDefense Secretary, number two only to the President in US military command,didn’t know until about 9.20 to 9.25? Where does that leave the ‘just’ hit theWorld Trade Center in the Rumsfeld story and why was he not told about thesecond hit at 9.03? Rumsfeld’s own Department of Defense manual says: ‘In theevent of a hijacking, the [National Military Command Center at the Pentagon]will be notified by the most expeditious means by the FAA. The NMCC will, withthe exception of immediate responses … forward requests for DOD assistance tothe Secretary of Defense for approval’. Given this procedure alone, theSecretary of Defense would surely have been told immediately the first planecrashed into the North Tower – fifty to fifty-five minutes before the Pentagonwas hit, not fifteen. He would have had to have been told, under the Pentagon’sown procedures, immediately it was known that the first plane had been hijacked.That would have been after around 8.20 – an hour and twenty minutes before thePentagon was hit. The lies are just so breathtaking. In his ‘evidence’ to the9/11 Commission, Rumsfeld confirmed his version of events when he said that hewas told of what had happened in New York and ‘shortly thereafter’ the Pentagonwas hit. He changes his Larry King story in the Commission version, however, inthat he says he was in his office ‘with a CIA briefer’ (not ‘right next door’ ashe said to King) and he was told of the second attack in New York before‘shortly thereafter’ the Pentagon was hit at 9.38. This version is equallydevoid of credibility. The second crash was shown on live television at 9.03 andthis is the Defense Secretary sitting two hundred feet from the NationalMilitary Command Center from where hijack responses are coordinated. If you onlybelieve the pathetic official version that Pentagon officials were given twelveminutes’ warning of the plane heading their way (unlike Cheney), why would noone tell the Defense Secretary before he felt his ‘jarring thing’? According tothe official story from Rumsfeld’s own military, jets were dispatched fromLangley at 9.30 to intercept the plane and still Rumsfeld, sitting in thePentagon, had no warning that the building was likely to be hit? Nowhere, butnowhere, do their pieces fit and there is a very good reason for that. It’s apack of lies. I contacted the Pentagon with the following list of questions, butofficials chose not to answer them.> 1)With the capability of United States air defence, how can a hijacked> airliner, Flight 77, be allowed to fly for forty-five minutes towards> Washington, with communication lost with air traffic control and the> transponder turned off, approach a No Fly Zone and hit your headquarters> without any challenge whatsoever?> Refused to answer.> 2)Why was the Defense Secretary Mr Rumsfeld unaware that the plane was> approaching until the Pentagon was actually struck?> Refused to answer.> 3)Why was Secretary Rumsfeld not told of the first plane striking the WTC> until around fifteen minutes before Flight 77 struck the Pentagon (thus about> 9.20 am to 9.25 am)? Why was he not told at this time that a second plane had> struck the World Trade Center?> Refused to answer.> 4)Why was Richard Myers, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not> informed that two planes had struck the WTC and that another was heading for> Washington while he was in a scheduled meeting on Capitol Hill and available> throughout? Why did he only learn of what was happening when he emerged from> the meeting to be told that the Pentagon had been hit? Is there not a constant> communication link between the Chairman and the Pentagon?> Refused to answer.> 5)Why were the ground to air defences at the Pentagon and the White House not> activated when Flight 77 approached?> Refused to answer.Clarke’s bombshellIn 2004, Richard Clarke, Bush’s counterterrorism advisor at the time ofSeptember 11th, published a book, Against All Enemies, that demolished theaccounts of both Myers and Rumsfeld. Clarke was at a conference when he heardabout Flight 11, and, in the five minutes or so it took him to get to the WhiteHouse, he ordered a secure teleconference to be organised with theCounterterrorism Security Group. This includes key personnel in governmentcounterterrorism and security agencies. When he heard that the second tower hadbeen hit, he said: ‘I want the highest level person in Washington from eachagency on-screen now, especially the FAA.’ Clarke immediately made contact withVice- President Cheney and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who werein Cheney’s White House office. Cheney told him: ‘It’s an al-Qaeda attack andthey like simultaneous attacks. This may not be over’. It was just a few minutesafter the second tower was hit at 9.03. How on earth could Cheney make such astatement when, according to the official story, everyone else was runningaround in confusion wondering what the hell was happening? As with allProblem-Reaction-Solution events, the false villain story is prepared andwaiting when the ‘problem’ occurs. Hence, minutes after the first attacks,Cheney was already selling his manufactured culprits – Osama bin Laden and‘al-Qaeda’. Remember, too, that Cheney was the man with ultimate responsibilityfor the wargame exercises going on in the skies at this same time.Richard Clarke told Cheney and Rice that he was instigating ‘a secureteleconference to manage the crisis’. As he left, Clarke saw them both gatheringpapers and preparing to leave for the Presidential Emergency Operations Center(PEOC) in the East Wing of the White House. This was about 9.10, and DavidBohrer, a White House photographer, says that he saw Cheney head for the bunkerjust after 9 am, which supports Clarke’s version. However, Cheney and theofficial account says he didn’t leave until 9.30. He told NBC’s Meet the Pressthat Flight 77 was being tracked and ‘when it entered the danger zone and lookedlike it was headed for the White House they grabbed me and evacuated me to thebasement [the White House ‘bunker’] …’ Yeah, sure Dick, and there were fairiesthere to help them, right? The whole story was a lie, because by the time thiswas supposed to have happened, Cheney was already in the White House bunker andnot his office, as confirmed by both Richard Clarke and Transportation SecretaryNorman Mineta. Cheney’s false account was parroted to help him claim ignoranceabout events in the sky, especially Flight 77. His wife, Lynne Cheney, a memberof the American Enterprise Institute, a stable mate of the Project for the NewAmerican Century, was to join him and Rice in the White House operations bunker.Also there were Cheney’s Chief of Staff Lewis ‘Scooter’ Libby (Project for theNew American Century) and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten (Councilon Foreign Relations). Richard Clarke described Cheney’s East Wing commandoperation as ‘decidedly more political’ than the one he was running, and Cheneywas constantly hanging up the line to Clarke’s teleconference.Clarke says it was about 9.10-ish when he arrived at the Secure VideoConferencing Center, next to the Situation Room in the West Wing, and began todirect and discuss a response to the attacks with leading military and FAAofficials. Note the time – about 9.10, or just after. Clarke says that otherstaking part in this teleconference were CIA Director George Tenet, FBI DirectorRobert Mueller, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, Deputy Attorney General LarryThompson, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and … here we go … DefenseSecretary Donald Rumsfeld and acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,General Richard Myers. Both men, says Clarke, were ‘surrounded by generals andcolonels’ the whole time. Well, well. So what happened to Rumsfeld’s account onLarry King Live that he was handed a note in his office about 9.25 telling himthat the first plane had hit the World Trade Center, but not the second, andthat he felt a ‘jarring thing’ when the Pentagon was hit, an attack for which hewas given no warning? Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta told the 9/11Commission that he was in Cheney’s East Wing bunker as the ‘young man’ wasgiving Cheney regular reports of the progress of ‘Flight 77’ heading forWashington, but the Defense Secretary in a teleconference with open voice linesto Cheney’s operation didn’t know? If Cheney knew, the military knew, so whydidn’t Rumsfeld? What nonsense. Richard Clarke says that Rumsfeld joined theteleconference minutes after the second plane crashed in New York and remainedthroughout. Clarke had said when the Pentagon was struck: ‘I can still seeRumsfeld on the screen, so the whole building didn’t get hit’. Rumsfeld is aliar.What happened to Myers’ story that he was on Capitol Hill having a meeting withSenator Max Cleland while all this was going on? He said he had seen that aplane had hit the first tower (8.46), but had still gone into the meeting withCleland and did not come out until the Pentagon was hit (9.38). In the interim,he said that no one had told the top uniformed commander in the US military onduty that day that a second plane had crashed at 9.03. Yet here he was allalong, according to Richard Clarke, taking part in a teleconference withRumsfeld and company at the Pentagon. Clarke even recounts one exchange he hadwith Myers at 9.28. He told Myers that he assumed that NORAD had alreadyscrambled fighters and AWAC recognisance aircraft. ‘How many? Where?’, he asked.Myers had replied:> Not a pretty picture, Dick. We are in the middle of Vigilant Warrior, a NORAD> exercise, but ... Otis has launched two birds toward New York. Langley is> trying to get two up now. The AWACS are at Tinker and not on alert. Clarke asked: ‘Okay, how long to CAP [combat air patrol] over DC?’ Myersreplied: ‘Fast as we can. Fifteen minutes’. It was actually thirty minutes and,as always, too late. This is the same General Myers who told a hearing onCapitol Hill two days later that ‘to the best of my knowledge’ no fighters werescrambled before the Pentagon was hit. Both Rumsfeld and Myers lied about wherethey were and what they were doing, and their lies were meant to hide whatreally happened that morning. The idea was to sell the public a story ofapparent confusion to hide coldly-calculated design.Look at the other implications in what Clarke describes. He was on the line withNORAD and he confirmed that FAA Administrator Jane Garvey was also there. Thisteleconference alone, starting around 9.10, connected NORAD, the FAA and thePentagon via Rumsfeld and Myers and their ‘generals and colonels’. What is allthis stuff from NORAD and the military about the FAA not telling them in time toreact? We are told in one diversion that air traffic was not sure if Flight 11had crashed into the North Tower, because American Airlines would not confirmit. How can this claim stand up when Clarke opened his teleconference, not longafter 9 am, by asking FAA Administrator Jane Garvey what she knew? Clarke saysshe replied: ‘The two aircraft that went [into the WTC] were American Flight 11,a 767, and United 175, also a 767 – hijacked’. Where is the confusion in that?The NEADS operatives were not told about Flight 93 until after it crashed,according to the tapes subpoenaed by the 9/11 Commission, but Flight 93 wasbeing mentioned in the Richard Clarke teleconference at 9.35 when the FAA’s JaneGarvey reported it among possible hijacked flights. This was twenty-eightminutes before it crashed.The ludicrous ‘9/11 Commission’, which was set up not to find the truth, says ofthis teleconference: ‘It is not clear to us that the teleconference was fullyunder way before 9:37, when the Pentagon was struck’. This false time is in theCommission report to obscure the outrageous contradictions in the officialstory. It goes on: ‘We do not know who from Defense participated, but we knowthat in the first hour none of the personnel involved in managing the crisisdid’. Excuse me. A Commission that held months of hearings could not establish‘who from Defense’ participated in this crucial teleconference? Didn’t they ask?Or are the Pentagon, and everyone else who took part with Clarke, suffering frommass amnesia? No, the Commission is laying a diversion. To tell the truth andlist the people from the Pentagon who participated and the time they were there,including Rumsfeld and Myers, would destroy the official story. When you seeshortly who was involved in the compilation of the Commission’s ‘report’ you’llappreciate why it cannot be taken seriously. The report also says that none ofthe information conveyed in the White House teleconference, at least in thefirst hour, was being passed to the NMCC [National Military Command Center]’.The Command Center is located in the Joint Chiefs of Staff department of thePentagon and, in its own words, is responsible for ‘generating Emergency ActionMessages to launch control centers, nuclear submarines, recognisance aircraftand battlefield commanders worldwide’. It is essentially the control centre forthe entire military and described as a central clearinghouse. It providescontinuous monitoring and coordination of worldwide military operations, andsupports commanders, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Secretary of Defense andthe President, in the command and control of US armed forces in peacetime,contingencies and war. Well, if you believe the 9/11 Commission, and no one witha brain will do so, all this is happening twenty-four hours of every day –except on September 11th. The Commission report says that Richard Clarke’steleconference was not connected into the area of the NMCC from where the crisiswas being managed, and ‘the director of the operations team who was on the phonewith NORAD did not have the benefit of information being shared on theteleconference’. Nonsense. Clarke confirms that the Secretary of State forDefense and the acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second andthird in command of the entire US military, were surrounded by generals andcolonels during the conference. But still the Pentagon Command Center didn’tknow what was going on?? Lies, lies, lies (Figure 172).Image [../Images/00181.jpg]Figure 172: The official version of 9/11 has just left the building Boy Bush – pocket manThe puppet president was kept out of harm’s way in Florida that morning. By‘harm’s way’, I don’t mean as in ‘safe’, but as in unable to mess up theorchestration of 9/11 by a network involving Cheney, the Pentagon, andIlluminati agents throughout the system. Missing people was quite a theme.Secretary of State Colin Powell was travelling, so allowing Illuminati goferRichard Armitage (Project for the New American Century) to stand in; AttorneyGeneral John Ashcroft was away and replaced by Deputy Attorney General LarryThompson; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Henry Shelton was in flight toEurope and replaced by General Myers; and Michael Canavan, the head of FAAsecurity and hijack coordinator, was in Puerto Rico and, in his words, missedout on ‘everything that transpired that day’. Or did he? President Bush was inbrother Jeb’s state of Florida for a pre-publicised photo opportunity at theEmma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota and left his hotel for the venueabout 8.35 am. What he did that morning, and when and how he heard of Flight 11striking the World Trade Center, depends very much on which official account youwant to believe – if any. There are several versions from people like Bush,Cheney and Ari Fleischer, the President’s then press secretary. Sonya Ross, anAssociated Press reporter, said she knew of the Flight 11 crash even before Bushhad reached the school that morning:> My cell phone rang as President Bush’s motorcade coursed toward Emma E. Booker> Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. A colleague reported that a plane had> crashed into the World Trade Center in New York. No further information. > I called the AP desk in Washington, seeking details. But I knew it had to be> grim. I searched for a White House official to question, but none was on hand> until 9.05 am. If her office knew, and had time to call her on a cell phone, Bush must haveknown well before he arrived at the school that the aircraft had struck theWorld Trade Center. He must have also known even earlier that there was a hijackin progress on Flight 11. Contact was lost with the aircraft at 8.13 am and thePresident travels with staff who are in instant contact with the NationalMilitary Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon, which coordinates with NORAD,the FAA and the government intelligence network during hijackings. John Cochran,an ABC journalist, was reporting Bush’s visit to Florida that day. He told PeterJennings on ABC:> Peter, as you know, the President’s down in Florida talking about education.> He got out of his hotel suite this morning, was about to leave, reporters saw> the White House Chief of Staff, Andy Card, whisper into his ear. The reporter> said to the President, ‘Do you know what’s going on in New York?’ He said he> did, and he said he will have something about it later. His first event is> about half an hour at an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida. At the very least from about 8.46 am when Flight 11 crashed, the Secret Service,which looks after the safety of the President, had ‘open lines’ with the FAA.This was confirmed by Vice-President Dick Cheney on NBC’s Meet the Press. Hesaid: ‘The Secret Service has an arrangement with the FAA. They had open linesafter the World Trade Center was ...’ At this point he stopped mid-sentence,realising no doubt that he was shooting a massive hole in the official story,which is based on selling a belief in confusion and lack of information. Theopen lines would surely have been activated earlier than that when Flight 11began to act very strangely and dramatically change course. The Bush team inFlorida knew precisely what the FAA knew by that time – indeed suspected fromabout 8.20 – that Flight 11 had been hijacked. It would have been the most basicsecurity response to keep the President away from a pre-arranged, publicised,event at a school. Especially after Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center, thethought that the President could be a target of a similar attack must haveoccurred to them, but there appears to have been no discussion about thePresident’s security and off he went to the school as planned. Did they knowsomething we didn’t? The 9/11 Commission claims that no one in the White Houseor travelling with the President knew that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and onlyafter it crashed did duty officers at the White House and Pentagon tell seniorofficials what had happened. Even with secure phone lines in the President’s carfor just such emergencies, it is claimed that he didn’t know about the WorldTrade Center being hit until his motorcade arrived at the school. We are beingasked to accept that the President wasn’t told when others in the motorcade weretold before it reached the school? According to the Christian Science Monitor,press secretary Ari Fleischer was called while riding in a different car to thePresident. He is reported to have said: ‘Oh, my God, I don’t believe it. A planejust hit the World Trade Center’. Congressman Dan Miller said he was told aboutthe crash just before meeting Bush at the Booker school at 8.55 am. SarasotaMagazine reports that Bush was on Highway 301, just north of Main Street, whenhe was told that the plane had crashed in New York. This would be quite crediblegiven that the crash happened at 8.46 and Bush didn’t arrive at the school until8.55. The official story is that he didn’t know until he got to the school. Asinvestigative author, James Bamford, said:> Despite having a secure STU-III phone next to [Bush] in the presidential> limousine and an entire national security staff at the White House, it appears> that the President of the United States knew less than tens of millions of> other people in every part of the country who were watching the attack as it> unfolded. Bush completely contradicted the eyewitness and other reports about hisknowledge and actions – and earlier accounts of his own officials – in anextraordinary performance on December 4th at a ‘town meeting’ at the OrangeCounty Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, where he was answeringnon-challenging questions from a sycophantic audience. I actually watched thishappen live on CNN in a hotel bar. As I sipped my beer and despaired at the heroworship being enjoyed by such a moronic man, Bush made a startling statementabout September 11th. For the next two days I scanned the newspapers, theInternet ‘news’ sites, including CNN, but there was no mention of the amazingstatement he had made. Weeks later, a Belgian visitor to my website sent me thewords that Bush had said. They were posted on the White House website, hiddenaway in the full and long transcript of the meeting. Bush was talking about whathappened on September 11th and how he heard of the atrocities in New York, inanswer to a question from a young boy called Jordan:> Well, Jordan, you’re not going to believe what state I was in when I heard> about the terrorist attack [well it didn’t show]. I was in Florida. And my> Chief of Staff, Andy Card – actually, I was in a classroom talking about a> reading program that works. I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go> in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower – the TV was obviously on. And I used> to fly, myself, and I said, well, there’s one terrible pilot. I said it must> have been a horrible accident. But I was whisked off there; I didn’t have much> time to think about it. And I was sitting in the classroom, and Andy Card, my> Chief of Staff, who is sitting over here, walked in and said, ‘A second plane> has hit the tower, America is under attack’. Image [../Images/00182.jpg]Figure 173: White House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, tells George Bush that‘America is under attack’. Well, that’s Bush’s version, anyway When you look at the video footage of Card talking to Bush there is no way hehad time to say that. Anyway, a few facts. There was no live television coverageof the first plane hitting the tower – how could there be? The recorded footageof the first crash did not air until long after Bush went into the classroomwhere he was told of the second crash by Card (Figure 173). The live pictureswere of the second plane when the television networks were already broadcastingshots of the burning North Tower. How could Bush, therefore, claim to have seenthe first plane strike on television? This is simply not possible, so what onearth is he talking about? What about his reaction of ‘there’s one terriblepilot’? A passenger jet crashes into a 110-storey building full of people andall the President of the United States can say is ‘there’s one terrible pilot’!We have already seen that Bush must have known about the first crash before heeven arrived at the school and he wants us to believe that the President of theUnited States, the Commander-in-Chief of US forces and ‘homeland’ defence, wouldnot be told before that time how contact with Flight 11 had been lost, itstransponder turned off, and how it had veered sharply off-course? Bush,remember, said before leaving his hotel for the school that he would ‘havesomething later’ about what was happening in New York and the Associated Pressreporter said she knew of the first crash before Bush had even arrived at theschool.His story is also in direct contradiction to the earlier official version thathe was told about Flight 11 in a call from his National Security Adviser,Condoleezza Rice, before he went into the classroom. This, in turn, contradictsthe accounts of reporters who make it clear that Bush must have known what washappening before he arrived at the school. Why wouldn’t he when anyone watchingtelevision did? Another question here, too. If Bush says that Andrew Card toldhim that ‘America is under attack’ at 9.05, how come there was no fighterresponse from the military to protect American cities and airspace? Knowing whathad happened and knowing the plane had been hijacked, how did the President ofthe United States react to these monumental events? He walked into a classroomto read to children from the second grade and hear them read him a story about apet goat! As the children read to him, he said: ‘Really good readers – whew!’Bush interrupted at one point, saying, ‘This must be sixth grade’. God help us.There has just been a catastrophe in New York, Mr President, involving thousandsof people, and you know the cause is a hijacked airliner. Hellooo? When AndrewCard came into the classroom and whispered in his ear that a second plane hadhit the World Trade Center, and that ‘America is under attack’, what did thePresident do then? He continued to sit there listening to a story about a petgoat. The Associated Press reported on September 12th:> In Sarasota, Florida, Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9.05 am> when his chief of staff Andrew Card whispered into his ear. The President> briefly turned somber before he resumed reading. He addressed the tragedy> about a half-hour later. He ‘briefly’ turned somber, or sombre, as we spell it in Britain? He’s just beentold that a second commercial airliner has struck the World Trade Center and,according to him, that ‘America is under attack’. Death and destruction on amassive scale was already obvious and the President knew the first plane hadbeen hijacked. But, he turned ‘briefly somber’ before continuing to focus on theadventures of a pet goat. Jenna Heath of Cox Newspapers’ Washington Bureaureported that Bush ‘did not appear preoccupied’ as he introduced EducationSecretary Rod Paige inside the classroom and shook hands with teacher Sandra KayDaniels. ‘There was no sign that [Condoleezza] Rice had just told Bush about thefirst attack on New York’s World Trade Center during a telephone call’, Heathwrote. Look at his reaction when Card ‘whispered in his ear’ before he left hishotel. ‘He did not respond’, said witnesses. Is this really a natural responsefrom a man who has just been told of such events in the country he is supposedto be leading? Or, is it the response of someone who knew full well what wasgoing on and why? Bush told the Florida town meeting on December 4th:> But I knew I needed to act. I knew that if the nation’s under attack, the role> of the Commander-in-Chief is to respond forcefully to prevent other attacks> from happening. And so, I’ve talked to the Secretary of Defense; one of the> first acts I did was to put our military on alert. Bush says he knew he needed to act, but the indisputable truth is that hedidn’t. The guy I met who worked on the computer air defence system forAustralia told me that they were put on high alert on 9/11 before the Americanmilitary was. And what’s all that about calling Defense Secretary Rumsfeld? Whendid he do that? Rumsfeld told Larry King that even though he was in his officein the Pentagon, he didn’t know anything until fifteen minutes before thePentagon was struck at about 9.38. We are being told here that although thePresident knew well before 9 am, the Defense Secretary was not told until atleast half an hour later when he was in his office at the Pentagon. Why didn’tRumsfeld tell King he had spoken with the President and where is any mention inthe teleconference version of Rumsfeld’s movements of him talking with Bush?Wherever you look, there is a deluge of lies and contradictions. Bush says thathe put the military on alert, but he could not have done this until he wasfinished with the goat story and left the classroom shortly before 9.30 – morethan forty minutes after the first plane hit. The official tale is that Bush wastaken to a private room before he went into the classroom and spoke on the phonewith his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who told him about Flight11. If Bush talked to his National Security Adviser before 9 am, how comeDefense Secretary Rumsfeld says he didn’t know anything for another twenty-fiveminutes? Why was Rice not in immediate contact with Rumsfeld? Why wasn’t thePresident? Why wasn’t anyone? Why didn’t Bush talk with Cheney when, at thistime, Rice was in Cheney’s office? It was 9.30 – twenty-five minutes afterhearing of the second crash – before Bush went into the school library toannounce:> Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. Two airplanes> have crashed into the World Trade Center, in an apparent terrorist attack on> our country. I am going to conduct a full-scale investigation and hunt down> and find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will> not stand. No, Mr Bush, you were about to name the false villain and the target that suitedthe agenda of those who control you. The ‘folks’ are much closer to home, as youwell know. Bush was taken to Air Force One, the presidential plane, and even theofficial story says that he did not call Cheney and put the US military on highalert status until at least 10 am, by which time the Pentagon had been hit. Bushheaded for Barksdale Air Force base, Louisiana, and the US Strategic Command atOffutt Air Force base in Nebraska, and did not arrive at the White House, viathe Andrews Air Force Base, until shortly before 7 pm. This was more than tenhours after the first strike on the World Trade Center. When understandablequestions were being asked about why Bush did not head straight for Washingtonto lead his country at such a terrible time, the White House said that they hadreceived a phone call giving a secret code to say that Air Force One was thenext target. No, they didn’t, that was yet another lie. John Ashcroft, theAttorney General and the man who delivered ‘justice’ to others after 9/11, alsosaid the ‘government has credible evidence that the White House and Air ForceOne were targets’. Lie again. Reports were circulated through the news agencieson September 12th that quoted a White House spokesman as saying: ‘There was realand credible information that the White House and Air Force One were targets ofterrorist attacks and that the plane which hit the Pentagon was headed for theWhite House’. Ari Fleischer, the White House Press Secretary, confirmed this thesame afternoon. The Secret Service had ‘specific and credible information’ thatthe White House and Air Force One were potential targets, he said. Bush’s chief‘political strategist’ (spinner of lies), the Enron shareholder Karl Rove, wasquoted the following day as confirming that the threat came in language thatproved the terrorists had knowledge of the President’s ‘procedures andwhereabouts’. If they are so concerned with his protection why did they allowhim to attend a publicised appearance at a school in the circumstances of thatmorning and why, if there was a specific threat to Air Force One, was Bush takenstraight to the airport to take off in that plane after he had finished with thepet goat story and without fighter protection? Why would terrorists warn theauthorities about their next target when there was no warning for any of theothers? Maureen Dowd wrote in The New York Times that Karl Rove had ‘calledaround town, trying to sell reporters the story’. Two weeks later the WhiteHouse was forced to back down on the whole fantasy and on September 25th the CBSEvening News reported that the call ‘simply never happened’. Most newspapers didnot even report this fantastic exposure of the lies spewed out daily by the Bushadministration, and The Washington Post only ran the story on an inside page.Once again I sent a list of questions to the White House media office relatingto these events. They were faxed in May 2002, but they chose not to answer.> 1)When did the President know that Flight 11 was in trouble or there could be> a problem? When did the FAA, NORAD and the Pentagon communicate this> information to the President’s support team in Florida that morning?> Would not respond.> 2)Why, when he was told of the first plane striking the WTC, did the President> continue with his engagement and go into a reading class at the Emma Booker> School?> Would not respond.> 3)Why, when told by Andrew Card in the classroom that a second plane had> struck the WTC and that ‘America is under attack’, did he continue to stay in> the classroom for some time?> Would not respond.> 4)When did the President put the United States military on high alert?> Would not respond.> 5)Why did the President not go back to Washington immediately when we now know> that the story of the telephone warning that Air Force One was the next target> never happened?> Would not respond.> 6)Why did the President tell a public meeting that he saw the first plane> strike the WTC and said ‘there’s one terrible pilot’, when he could not> possibly have seen that happen before he entered the classroom? That footage> was not aired until much later.> Would not respond.> 7)Why was the President not considered to be in danger when the attacks began,> and thus removed from the school and a pre-announced visit when the school was> only a short distance from an airport?> Would not respond.Omission by CommissionAll these lies and contradictions were there to be exposed from the start bywhat pass for ‘journalists’, and later by the 9/11 Commission, or, to give itits full title, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the UnitedStates. The media ignored this mountain of evidence and has chosen ever since toslavishly repeat the nonsensical official story. The same empty-vessel‘journalists’ ridicule those in the alternative media who have the vision to seethe elephant. The 9/11 Commission’s final report was an utter disgrace in whatit failed to highlight, or even mention. Evidence as significant as NormanMineta’s description of Cheney in his bunker, and his statement that ‘the ordersstill stand’, was left out of the published report, along with anything elsethat put the government’s basic story in doubt. Bush, Cheney and Rice dideverything they could to stop any investigation at all, as did Blair after theLondon bombings of 2005. Why would they want a proper investigation into theseevents when they knew that the official version was a lie? When they could notresist demands for an inquiry any longer, Bush announced in late 2002 that itwould be headed by … Henry Kissinger. I have already explained that Kissinger isone of the most active and manipulative Illuminati operatives of the last fortyyears and, as insider-writer Bob Woodward revealed in 2006, he is still‘advising’ Bush on foreign policy. Kissinger was a Neocon before the word hadeven been coined, and he is close to all the main players in the Project for theNew American Century (Figure 174). Anyone who names Kissinger to ‘investigate’anything is desperate for a cover up. Even The New York Times suggested theWhite House chose him ‘to contain an investigation it has long opposed’. Theappointment was so outrageous that Kissinger had to resign in the face offundamental conflicts of interest involving his infamous Illuminati frontcompany, Kissinger Associates, which is exposed in my other books like … And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. Kissinger would have had to disclose the clients ofKissinger Associates and there was no way he was going to do that. If he had, itwould not so much have opened a can of worms as launched the lid into orbit.Image [../Images/00183.jpg]Figure 174: Henry Kissinger takes a break for lunch Kissinger was replaced by the Republican Thomas Kean, the former governor forNew Jersey, as chairman of the 9/11 Commission. Kean was just another insider.He had been a director of the National Endowment for Democracy, a long-timefront for CIA covert operations overseas, and has investment connections to thesame Saudi sources that have funded both President Bush and Osama bin Laden.Among them are Khalid bin Mahfouz, who was named by the Clinton State Departmentas a financer of terrorism. Commission vice-chairman Lee Hamilton sat onadvisory boards to the CIA, the President’s Homeland Security Advisory Counciland the US Army. Another member of the Commission was Richard Ben-Veniste whowas the Senate-appointed lawyer for the Clintons during the Whitewatercorruption ‘investigation’, and also attorney for Barry Seal, who flew cocaineinto the Mena airstrip in Arkansas for the Clinton and Bush families. More aboutthis later. Where’s the Commission’s independence? Kean and his fellow‘investigators’ didn’t even write the final report. This was supervised by theCommission’s executive staff director, Philip Zelikow, who was appointed by Bushto the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and was for three yearson the National Security Council of Father Bush. Zelikow has worked closely withCondoleezza Rice and even co-wrote a book with her, Germany Unified and EuropeTransformed: A Study in Statecraft. She appointed him to be the main writer ofthe Bush National Security Strategy in 2002 that used 9/11 to justify the policyof attacking countries that posed no imminent threat. This was the same guy whowas executive director of the Commission ‘investigating’, among other things,the actions of Bush and Rice on September 11th. Zelikow also directed the AspenStrategy Group, a foreign-policy strategy body co-chaired by Rice’s mentor,Brent Scowcroft (Kissinger Associates, Council on Foreign Relations). Rice,Cheney and Wolfowitz were also members. The 9/11 Family Steering Committee and9/11 Citizens Watch called for his resignation to no avail. It was Zelikow whodecided what would be pursued or ignored, and what would appear in the final‘report’. He led a staff of some seventy-five people and more than half of themwere formerly with the CIA, FBI, Department of [In]Justice and other agencies ofgovernment. One staff member said: ‘Zelikow is calling the shots. He’s skewingthe investigation and running it his own way’. This is why crucial informationand contradictions in evidence were ignored. One of the commissioners, the, bythen, former Senator, Max Cleland, resigned from the inquiry, saying ‘Bush isscamming America’. He said that Commission members had agreed a deal thatallowed them only very limited access to CIA reports presented to Bush and theWhite House that could have indicated prior knowledge of the attacks. He said:> This is a scam. It’s disgusting. America is being cheated. As each day goes by> we learn that this government knew a whole lot more about these terrorists> before September 11 than it has ever admitted … Let’s chase this rabbit into> the ground. They had a plan to go to war and when 9/11 happened that’s what> they did; they went to war. After the attacks were over, Dick Cheney left the White House bunker andrelocated to Site R, or the ‘underground Pentagon’ as it is known, a top-secretcomplex of buildings inside Raven Rock Mountain, near Blue Ridge Summit,Pennsylvania, about seven miles north of the presidential ‘retreat’ at CampDavid. Site R is also known as the Alternate Joint Communications Center.Journalist James Bamford, a former ABC investigative producer and anintelligence specialist, said that hours after the attacks five helicoptersarrived at Site R, together with a convoy of vehicles with black-tinted windows.One of the first people to arrive was the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and thereal power at the Pentagon, Paul Wolfowitz, who went on to head World Bankbefore corruption finished him. Wolfowitz, like Cheney, is a founding member ofthe Project for the New American Century and closely associated with the JewishInstitute for National Security Affairs (JINSA). He was also the Bushadministration’s liaison to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one ofWashington’s biggest lobby groups, which campaigns for policies favourable toIsrael. Cheney would disappear for long periods in the wake of 9/11 to topsecret locations preparing for the next stage of the attack on human freedom.What a coincidence that the Project for the New American Century said there hadto be a ‘new Pearl Harbor’ as an excuse to impose their agenda for conquest inthe Middle East and, a year to the month after this report was published, itcomes to pass. What’s more, the Bush administration that came to power inJanuary 2001 was dominated by members of the same organisation. As the ‘newPearl Harbor’ was unfolding, there at the top of the political and militaryhierarchy in the key command centers were Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and DonaldRumsfeld, all founding members of the Project for the New American Century. Themassive increases in military spending they said they would get in the wake a‘new Pearl Harbor’, were channelled through the Project for the New AmericanCentury’s Dov Zackheim, the Pentagon Comptroller in charge of finances. Underhis watch, more than three trillion dollars was found to be missing in thePentagon accounts.It is clear now that enormous – and growing – numbers of people do not acceptthe official story of 9/11, but many of these believe that the government tookadvantage of the attacks and allowed them to happen. I know it’s a big leap, butit needs to be made. The 9/11 attacks were not just allowed to happen, they weremade to happen, as we shall now see."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 15 The miracle factory > Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn’t. And> contrary wise, what it is, it wouldn’t be. And what it wouldn’t be, it would.> You see? > Alice in Wonderland I know that many will find it hard to believe that controlling elements withinthe United States government and military would orchestrate attacks on their‘own people’, but there are some things to understand here.American citizens are not considered by American–based Reptilian hybrids to betheir ‘own people’, any more than Jewish or British hybrids see the Jewish andBritish masses as ‘their own’. No matter what race or country they may appear torepresent, they have an allegiance to a very different ‘nation’ – the Reptilianhybrids and their Reptilian masters or ‘gods’. Anyone else is expendable anddeletable if it advances the ‘cause’ and, in fact, they see each other asexpendable if the agenda demands it. They know this world is an illusion andthey just move between dimensions when they ‘die’. Indeed, the possessingReptilian entities don’t ‘die’, they just switch to another body-computer whentheirs can no longer function.While it may seem astonishing that governments and their military could plan andexecute attacks on their fellow citizens, the proof exists that exactly this wasbeing prepared more than forty years before September 11th 2001. The plan wasthe work of the very Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon that I would say wereinvolved in 9/11. Not only would they attack their ‘own people’ on such a scale,they had clearly planned to do so in the 1960s. In April 2001, four monthsbefore 9/11, a book was published by James Bamford, a former WashingtonInvestigative Producer for World News Tonight on ABC Television. It was calledBody of Secrets and revealed a plan hatched by America’s top military leaders tocommit acts of terrorism in US cities, kill civilians and blame it on the Cubanpresident, Fidel Castro. The plan was devised by the Joint Chiefs of Staff undertheir chairman, Army General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, and it was called OperationNorthwoods. Forty years on, the latter-day Joint Chiefs were in the PentagonCommand Center orchestrating events on 9/11. Operation Northwoods was designedto win public and international support for an invasion of Cuba that wouldremove Castro, while the September 11th attacks were engineered to justify theOrwellian state and the ‘war on terror’. James Bamford was researching theNational Security Agency (NSA) when he came across official documents detailingthe Northwoods operation. They revealed plans to blow up an American ship andblame Cuba, and they say: ‘… Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause ahelpful wave of national indignation’. The Joint Chiefs also proposed to killthe astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbitand blame that on Cuba, the documents reveal. If Glenn’s rocket exploded, ‘theobjective is to provide irrevocable proof … that the fault lies with … Communist… Cuba’, say the Northwood documents. Bamford writes:> … the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of> the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American> streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas;> for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington DC, Miami, and> elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes> would be hijacked. Using phoney evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro,> thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and> international backing, they needed to launch their war. The plan was to stir up so much hatred for Cuba in the United States that thepeople would support an invasion and even demand that it was done. They intendedto explode plastic bombs, arrest Cuban agents and release previously prepareddocuments falsely substantiating Cuban involvement. The plan included attacks onthe now infamous US base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba where, since the invasion ofAfghanistan, the ‘Land of Freedom’ has kept untried and uncharged ‘terrorists’in disgraceful, inhuman, conditions. These attacks on the base would be blamed,once again, on Castro. The documents speak of ‘a series of well co-ordinatedincidents … in and around Guantanamo to give the genuine appearance of beingdone by hostile Cuban forces’. A Memorandum of July 27th 1962 says that theoperation would mean an enormous increase in Cuban and American casualties. Thetechniques to be used included: starting rumours; using clandestine radio;landing friendly Cubans in uniform ‘over the fence’ to stage ‘attacks’ on thebase; capturing (friendly) Cuban ‘saboteurs’ inside the base; starting riotsnear the base main gate using friendly Cubans; blowing up ammunition inside thebase and starting fires; burning aircraft on the base and blaming Cuba; throwingmortar shells into the base; capturing assault teams approaching from the sea orGuantanamo City; capturing a militia group which storms the base to sabotage aship in harbour; sinking a ship near the harbour entrance; blowing up anunmanned vessel in Cuban water and blaming it on Cuban aircraft that wouldnaturally come and investigate what had happened; issue false casualty lists tothe US media to whip up public opinion against Cuba; and, look at this …‘conduct funerals for mock victims’.The Northwoods documents also call for the use of Soviet Union MIG-typelookalike aircraft flown by US pilots to harass civil aircraft, attack surfaceshipping and destroy US military ‘drone’ (remotely-controlled) aircraft to givethe impression it was all done by Cuba. ‘An F-86 properly painted would convinceair passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG …’ one document says. It was furtherplanned to stage the mock shooting-down of a US Air Force plane in internationalwaters by simply getting the pilot, using a made-up name, to report that he wasunder attack and stop transmitting. He would then fly back to his base where theplane would be repainted with a new tail number and the pilot would resume hisreal name. A US submarine would send aircraft to search for wreckage in the seaand this would be found to confirm the ‘Cuban’ attack. Bamford says the plansfor these terrorist acts against American targets had the written approval ofall the Joint Chiefs of Staff and were presented to President Kennedy in March1962 by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Eventually, the ‘civilian leadership’rejected them and three days later Kennedy told Lemnitzer there was virtually nochance of ever using overt force to take Cuba. Operation Northwoods remainedsecret for four decades until these documents came to light, but they mirrorwhat really happened on 9/11 – and since. James Bamford told his formeremployers at ABC News:> These were Joint Chiefs of Staff documents. The reason these were held secret> for so long is the Joint Chiefs never wanted to give these up because they> were so embarrassing. The whole point of a democracy is to have leaders> responding to the public will, and here this is the complete reverse, the> military trying to trick the American people into a war that they want, but> that nobody else wants. Bamford writes that even after the original plans were rejected, otherscontinued to be developed, such as creating a war between Cuba and another LatinAmerican country that would allow the US to intervene. In the end, it’s thehighest levels of the military and military intelligence that plan theseProblem-Reaction-Solution operations and they connect into organisations likethe National Security Agency and the CIA. It is no good people claiming theirleaders could not have been behind the horrors of 9/11 when the documents existto show that the Pentagon had planned in detail something very similar in the1960s. Operation Northwoods even involved the hijacking of civilian aircraft.The documents say it was possible to create an incident that would convince thepublic that a Cuban aircraft had shot down a chartered civil airliner on aflight from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Venezuela or Panama. Thedestination would be chosen so the route would cross Cuba. The ‘real’ plane(actually a CIA aircraft) would carry ‘selected’ passengers boarded under‘carefully prepared aliases’ and take off from a civilian airport. It would bereplaced in the sky over Florida with a remotely-controlled replacement and thiswould then be flown over Cuba, send out a distress signal, and be destroyed byradio signal. The original plane would be landed at an Air Force base where themake-believe ‘passengers’ would be taken off. All this was planned forty yearsbefore 9/11. Imagine what the remote-control technology is like today bycomparison? James Bamford quotes from the Northwoods documents in Body ofSecrets:> An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate> for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in> the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for> the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers,> all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft> would be converted into a drone [a remotely-controlled unmanned aircraft].> Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled> to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. > From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to> minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Elgin AFB where> arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the> aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to> fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on> the international distress frequency a ‘May Day’ message stating he is under> attack by Cuban MiG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by> destruction of the aircraft, which will be triggered by radio signal. This> will allow ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organisation] radio stations in> the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what has happened to the aircraft> instead of the US trying to ‘sell’ the incident. Forty years later, on September 11th 2001, something remarkably similarhappened, and, for Fidel Castro, read Osama bin Laden. It was clearly possiblefour decades earlier for transmissions to be made from an aircraft in whichthere were no pilots or passengers on board. You can see from these examples,and I could quote many more, that the Problem-Reaction-Solution techniquesemployed on September 11th are nothing new. But then, if it keeps working, whychange it?Hijacked from the groundThe ‘hijacked’ aircraft on 9/11 were remotely-controlled and with that knowledgemany of the ‘mysteries’ begin to dissolve. After the attacks, George W. Bushcalled for a system to be developed that would allow controllers on the groundto assume remote control of a hijacked aircraft and direct it to a safe landingat the nearest airport. The New York Times quoted him as saying that the newtechnology, ‘probably far in the future’, would allow air traffic controllers toland distressed planes by remote control. How can Bush say that such technologyis ‘probably far in the future’ when the existence of remotely-controlledaircraft is publicly known and has been in existence for at least forty years?Commercial aircraft are all flown by computer and to take control of a planefrom the ground all you need to do is hack into its flight management system.This is even simpler if the computers on your target aircraft have beenpre-programmed to ‘network’ with yours. A few weeks after 9/11,remotely-controlled aircraft were being flown over Afghanistan under the term‘surveillance drones’. A US Air Force fact sheet available to anyone on theInternet details the capabilities and background of a remotely-controlledaircraft called the Global Hawk that flies all over the world (Figure 175). Itsays that once the ‘mission parameters’ are programmed into Global Hawk theaircraft can ‘autonomously taxi, take off, fly, remain on station capturingimagery, return and land’. Operators on the ground can alter flying instructionsduring flight as necessary. Airman magazine summarised the control systems ofthe Global Hawk:> The bird’s ‘pilots’ stay on the ground. Its flight control, navigation and> vehicle management are independent and based on a mission plan. That means the> airplane flies itself – there’s no pilot on the ground with a joystick> manoeuvring it around. However, it does get instructions from airmen at ground> stations. The launch and recovery element provides precision guidance for> take-off and landing, using a differential global positioning system. That> team works from the plane’s operating base. Image [../Images/00184.jpg]Figure 175: The Global Hawk remotely-controlled aircraft that flies all over theworld without a pilot Global Hawk, which has a wingspan of a 737, was developed through the 1990s andthe principle contractor is the Illuminati-controlled Northrop Grumman at itsRyan Aeronautical Center in San Diego, California. Communications systems areprovided by L3 Com in Salt Lake City, Utah. In June 1999, Global Hawk begantests and exercises sponsored by US Joint Forces Command. James Roche, theBush-appointed US Secretary of the Air Force, held many executive posts withNorthrop Grumman, including corporate vice-president and president, ElectronicSensors and Systems Sector, before leaving to join the Bush gang in 2001. Roche,a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and Centre for Strategic Studies,became responsible for the Air Force’s ‘functioning and efficiency, theformulation of its policies and programmes’. This included NORAD. Dov Zakheimfrom the Project for the New American Century, the Pentagon Comptroller at thetime of 9/11, was also involved with remote-control technology. He moved to thePentagon in May 2001, the same month that Cheney was given control of US‘wargame’ exercises. Zakheim was CEO of SPC International, a subsidiary ofSystem Planning Corporation. This specialises in the development and manufactureof ‘defence equipment’, including aircraft remote control technology andsomething called the Flight Termination System (FTS). This destroysremotely-controlled aircraft used as target practice by the military when the‘drone’ malfunctions or becomes a danger for other reasons. The technology canbe used on all types of planes, including big passenger jets, and allows theremote control of many aircraft at the same time from one location over a rangeof hundreds of miles. Press a button on the ground and the plane is no more –Flight 93? Among the System Planning Corporation’s clients is Eglin Air ForceBase in Florida, which is mentioned in the Operation Northwoods documents as abase for the use of a remotely-controlled aircraft to simulate a commercialairliner being shot down over Cuba. As Pentagon Comptroller, Dov Zakheim sentmore than thirty Boeing 767s to the nearby Florida-MacDill Air Force Base before9/11, where they were refitted with refuelling equipment and other technology.The Flight Termination System and remote-control technology developed byZakheim’s company would have been perfect for directing the 9/11 planes to theirtargets. A subsidiary of Zackheim’s System Planning Corporation, a companycalled Tridata, was also appointed to investigate the bombing of the World TradeCenter in 1993 and gained an intimate knowledge of the building and securitysystem. The Illuminati world is very small indeed.The Dumb and Dumber ‘pilots’For sure, those planes on 9/11 were not piloted by ‘Arab terrorists’ whocouldn’t competently fly a one-engine Cessna. Retired Colonel Donn de Grand Présays he gathered together a group of experienced civilian and military pilots,including combat fighter pilots and commercial airline captains, to discuss whatcould have happened during what he described as a ‘so-called terrorist attack[that] was in fact a superbly executed military operation against the UnitedStates, requiring the utmost professional military skill in command,communications and control’. The group concluded, he said, that ‘the enemy iswithin the gates, that he has infiltrated into the highest policymakingpositions at the Federal level, and has absolute control, not only of the pursestrings, but of the troop build-up and deployment of our military forces,including active, reserve and National Guard units’. The colonel reported thatthe group of highly experienced pilots was not impressed by claims that the fouraircraft were flown by hijackers who had trained in one-engine planes. He saidone officer remarked: ‘I seriously question whether these novices could havelocated a target dead-on two hundred miles removed from take-off point – muchless controlled the flight and mastered the intricacies of 11FR [instrumentflight rules] – and all accomplished in 45 minutes’. The pilots said that theway the planes were flown ruled out the level of experience and competencereported for the ‘hijackers’. An Air Force officer, who flew more than a hundredsorties over North Vietnam, is quoted by the colonel as saying: ‘Those birdseither had a crack fighter pilot in the left seat, or they were being manoeuvredby remote control’. The latter would explain why massive aircraft could makesuch fantastic manoeuvres when ‘flown’ by ‘Arab pilots’, described as next touseless by their instructors at ‘one-engine’ flight schools. Rick Garza, aflight instructor at Sorbi’s Flying Club in San Diego, said of two ‘9/11hijackers’: ‘It was like Dumb and Dumber. I mean, they were clueless. It wasclear to me they weren’t going to make it as pilots’. There is no contradiction,no mystery, in how incompetent pilots could fly wide-bodied jets so brilliantlyonce you realise that they were not flying them. Remote controllers on theground were. Former Special Forces sergeant turned conspiracy investigator, StanGoff, put it like this in the case of Flight 77:> Now, the real kicker. A pilot they want us to believe was trained at a Florida> puddle-jumper school for Piper Cubs and Cessnas, conducts a well-controlled> downward spiral, descending the last 7,000 feet in two-and-a-half minutes,> brings the plane in so low and flat that it clips the electrical wires across> the street from the Pentagon, and flies it with pinpoint accuracy into the> side of this building at 460 nauts. When the theory about learning to fly this> well at the puddle-jumper school began to lose ground, it was added that they> received further training on a flight simulator. This is like saying you> prepared your teenager for her first drive on I-40 at rush hour by buying her> a video driving game. It’s horse shit! There is a story being constructed> about these events. An article by Alan Staats, first published in Quill magazine in February 1998and posted on the Internet after 9/11, details the history and development ofremote control technology. Staats writes:> Controlling the aircraft from the ground is nothing new. The military has been> flying obsolete high performance fighter aircraft as target drones since the> 1950s. In fact, NORAD (the North American Air Defense Command) had at its> disposal a number of US Air Force General Dynamics F-106 Delta Dart fighter> aircraft configured to be remotely flown into combat as early as 1959 under> the auspices of a program known as SAGE. These aircraft could be started,> taxied, taken off, flown into combat, fight, and return to a landing entirely> by remote control, with the only human intervention needed being to fuel and> re-arm them. To this day, drone aircraft are remotely flown from Air Force and> Naval bases all over the country to provide targets for both airborne and> ground based weapons platforms. Staats goes on to say that the technology exists (writing in 1998) that wouldallow a ground crew to override and direct the flight path of a hijacked planeand that the military has employed this capability since the 1950s. From theengineering point of view, he says, modifying and implementing the technologyfor use on passenger-carrying aircraft in the United States to fly them and landthem by remote control ‘is a relatively simple matter’. In fact, says Staats,‘autoland’ systems have been in wide commercial use in different parts of theworld since the 1980s. Auto landings are routinely performed thousands of timesa day throughout the world. Staats continues:> It is technically possible to create a system to perform remotely commanded> return flights of a hijacked airliner. Onboard digital command, control and> display equipment can easily share data with, and accept commands from, ground> control stations. Little input beyond the initial command to enter safe return> flight and the ultimate destination are needed. Commercial aircraft are largely flown by computers today and the pilot can havevery little to do with flying the plane once it’s off the ground. In the Boeing747-400, the computers are capable not only of landing the aircraft, but alsoapplying the brakes and bringing it to a halt. A flight plan agreed with theFederal Aviation Administration, or its equivalent around the world, is loadedinto the aircraft computer system or Flight Management System (FMS). This can bedone through direct programming or a disk. The flight programme includes theplanned height and speed of the plane throughout the flight, as it makes its waybetween points in the sky known as ‘waypoints’. When the plane has taken off, itaims for the first waypoint and then the computer will execute changes to aimfor the next point and so on to its destination. Therefore, as Staats pointsout:> Because all the components of controlling the aircraft communicate with each> other digitally through a central unit, the FMS, activating such a ‘safe> return’ system would be a matter of uploading commands to the FMS to fly the> aircraft to the nearest airport. Controlling the aircraft’s speed, altitude> and course, the FMS would guide it back to land. After intensely researching and following the story of 9/11 since the day of theattacks, I suggest that the following is very close to what happened thatmorning and all the technology exists to do this. The times when the fouraircraft were lost to air traffic control and the transponders went off, or inone case ‘switched’ to another frequency, was not the moment they were hijackedby ‘Arab terrorists’. It was the time the remote-control technology kicked inand overrode control from the cockpit. From this moment the planes were beingflown from the ground, not by a pilot. More than that, the remote controllershad access to all the aircrafts’ systems and could simulate the sound ofactivity on the plane, including ‘cell phone conversations’ and words apparentlyheard from the cockpit. What appeared to be coming from the planes was actuallycoming from the location from where the planes were being controlled. This iswhy, in the case of Flight 175, there was less than a minute between the lastcommunication with air traffic control, when everything was fine, and the suddenchange of direction and loss of transponder contact. The remote controllers hadtaken the plane over, and no doubt the pilots were frantically struggling withthe flight computer wondering what the hell was happening. When they tried totell air traffic they would have heard only silence because all the plane’ssystems were being controlled and directed from the ground. It is also possiblethat the planes were landed and replaced by others, in the manner described inOperation Northwoods. Look at all the confusion that ensued when transpondercontact went down and air traffic controllers say they ‘lost’ the planes. Howeasy the radar blip-switch would have been as aircraft were replaced in flight,as Northwoods planned to do. Mark Burnback, an employee of Fox Television, wasclose to the World Trade Center when ‘Flight 175’ crashed into the South Tower.He told WCBS in a live interview from the scene that it definitely did not looklike a commercial plane. ‘There was a blue logo on the front of the plane,’ hesaid. ‘I did not see any windows on the side. It was not a normal plane thatI’ve seen at the airport.’ This interview was never repeated. In support of thisscenario, experts have said that part of an engine from ‘Flight 175’ that wasfound in the street at the junction of Church and Murray was not from a 767, buta 737. It apparently fell on a police car and it was photographed (Figure 176).Nila Sagadevin, an airline pilot for more than twenty years, said of thepictures: ‘The engine found at the Trade Center is a CFM-56, which is notutilized on a Boeing 767’. Another twenty-year pilot, Glen Standish, said theplane could not have been Flight 175 because of all the extra equipment attachedto the bottom of the fuselage, and retired US Air Force colonel, George Nelson,with thirty years of experience identifying aircraft and their technology, said:‘The plane that hit the South Tower on 9/11 was not United Airlines Flight 175.That was not a commercial airliner. The planes were substituted’.Image [../Images/00185.jpg]Figure 176: Part of an aircraft engine found near the Twin Towers. Airlinepilots and aviation experts say this is not from a 767, but a 737 The next question that comes from this is what happened to the passengers andcrew? No one except those involved can know for sure, but they will no longer bewith us, apart from any government–military plants among them. It was for thisreason that there were strangely small passenger numbers on the four flights.This was by design, not coincidence, because it meant there were fewer people tocontrol or dispose of. Operation Northwoods planned to put passengers on‘hijacked’ planes with ‘carefully prepared aliases’. Control of all the flightand communication systems from the ground would explain how cell phones could beused ‘from the planes’ when it is highly unlikely, some say impossible, thatthey could have worked at those altitudes and speeds. Were the people whoanswered those phone calls actually talking to their loved ones on the planes?It is certainly possible that they were not. These guys have voice-recognitiontechnology that would make you think you were talking with someone you talk toevery day when it was really someone you had never met. It would explain whyFlight 93 passenger Mark Bingham started the conversation with his mother withthe bizarre words: ‘Mom, this is Mark Bingham’. It is important to keep in mindthat these people are using technology that is light-years ahead of anything wesee in the public domain. Once you move everything that is alleged to havehappened on the planes in the air to a command centre on the ground usingstate-of-the-art technology, the anomalies, contradictions and impossibilitiesstart to make sense. In April 2002, after months of stalling by the FBI, thefamilies of the passengers on Flight 93 were allowed to hear the cockpit voicerecording (or what was claimed to be the recording). Tom Burnett, the father ofTom Burnett Jr, said the tape was difficult to follow. ‘A lot wasunintelligible, and a lot of it we couldn’t follow very easily, so I don’t thinkit gives us resolution,’ he said, but he felt he had ‘learned something, anotherpiece of the puzzle’. The FBI has only said that the voice recorder includesscreaming and sounds of a struggle. Newsweek claimed to have been given atranscript of the cockpit recorder from FBI sources:> Beginning at 9.57, the cockpit voice recorder began to pick up the sounds of a> death struggle. There is the crash of galley dishes and trays being hurled, a> man’s voice screaming loudly. The hijackers can be heard calling on each other> to hold the door. One of the passengers cries out, ‘Let’s get them!’ More> crashing and screaming. In a desperate measure to control the rebellion, a> hijacker suggests cutting off the oxygen. Another one tells his confederates> to ‘take it easy’. The end is near. > The hijackers can be heard talking about finishing off the plane, which has> begun to dive. The hijackers cry out, ‘God is great!’ The cockpit voice> recorder picks up shouting by one of the male passengers. It is unclear> whether the passengers have breached the cockpit or are just outside the door.> The hijackers apparently begin to fight among themselves for the controls,> demanding, ‘Give it to me’. All that could have been put together in any sound studio and I suggest that itwas. I love the ‘God is Great’ bit – pure B-movie Hollywood. This cliché classicwas supposed to come from ‘Islamic fanatics’ who loved alcohol and strip-joints.Their pork-loving ‘leader’, Mohamed Atta, was once heard to exclaim: ‘Fuck God’.Where are the ‘black boxes’?There were eight ‘black boxes’ on the four aircraft, a Flight Data Recorder andCockpit Voice Recorder on each one, and yet the alleged Flight 93 tape is theonly one that has been made public. Even though there were two in each plane, weare told that most of them did not survive the crashes in a condition to providethe data, and that others did not reveal information that would prove whathappened. This many fatally-damaged black boxes is rather strange to say theleast and it’s simply not credible. They are designed precisely to surviveintact in the most extreme conditions, as we have seen so many times in otherair crashes all over the world year after year. The voice recorders wererecovered from Egypt Air Flight 990, which crashed into the ocean, and TWAFlight 800, which exploded in mid air after leaving New York. A few facts toponder from a report by ABC News:> Although investigators look for an entire black box, sometimes the only parts> of the device that survive are the recorder’s crash-survivable memory units> (CSMU). The CSMU is almost indestructible. It is housed within a> stainless-steel shell that contains titanium or aluminium and a> high-temperature insulation of dry silica material. > It is designed to withstand heat of up to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for one> hour, salt water for at least 30 days, immersion in a variety of liquids such> as jet fuel and lubricants, and an impact of 3,400 Gs. By comparison,> astronauts are typically exposed to up to six Gs during a shuttle takeoff. With their beacon transmitter, black boxes have been located deep under theocean and under piles of rubble when buildings have been struck. The ABC Newsinformation is confirmed by the United States National Transportation SafetyBoard on its official website. It also says that ‘both the Flight Data Recorderand the Cockpit Voice Recorder have proven to be valuable tools in the accidentinvestigation process. They can provide information that may be difficult toobtain by other means’. What a pity, then, that so many black boxes weredestroyed – or rather went missing – from four aircraft in four separatecrashes. FBI spokesman, Bill Crowley, said the cockpit voice recorder of Flight93 found at the Pennsylvania crash site was in ‘fairly good condition’, but thatofficials with the National Transportation Safety Board could not get sound fromthe device. As we’ve seen, the FBI later claimed to have played this cockpitrecording to relatives of those who died on Flight 93, but was it the real one?What was heard certainly appeared to be inconclusive and unclear. The FBI saidthat the cockpit recorder on Flight 77 that was recovered, we are told, from therubble of the Pentagon, could yield no information because it was too severelyburned. A black box can survive heat of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour! Iasked the FBI for details of the black boxes and their condition, but I was toldthat this information could not be given because of the ‘ongoing investigation’.Every other question about the official story was met with the same response.Did Flight 77 hit the Pentagon?The possible switching of the 9/11 aircraft and their replacement bymilitary-controlled planes brings into the perspective the claims that Flight 77did not hit the Pentagon. I stress that the conspiracy explanation of 9/11 doesnot depend on whether or not it was Flight 77, although that is the impressionthat many no-conspiracy theorists try to give. I don’t know for sure whetherFlight 77 hit the Pentagon or whether it didn’t. My view is that a plane of somekind did crash into the building, but it wasn’t Flight 77. Either way, there isso much more fundamental evidence to demolish the official story without thePentagon plane angle. It is, however, an area of legitimate investigation and Iwill briefly present some points and questions made and posed by researchers.People remember the aftermath of the ‘crash’ with the collapsed Pentagon wall,but this happened some twenty to thirty minutes after impact (Figure 177,overleaf). Before that, there was a much smaller hole which ripped through threeof the five rings of the building and came out the other side with another holeabout nine feet wide (Figure 178, overleaf). The distance between the two pointsis 310 feet of a seriously reinforced building. I saw an interview about thePentagon’s ‘mystery plane’ with Major General Albert Stubblebine, who was oncein charge of the Army’s imagery interpretation for scientific and technicalintelligence during the Cold War. He said:> I measured pieces of Soviet equipment from photographs. It was my job. I look> at the hole in the Pentagon, and I look at the size of the airplane that was> supposed to have hit the Pentagon, and I say the plane does not fit in that> hole. So what did hit the Pentagon? What hit it? Where is it? What’s going on? Image [../Images/00186.jpg]Figure 177: The scene that people remember, the collapsed wall at the Pentagon.But, this happened some twenty minutes or so after impact and, before then, thehole was much smaller Image [../Images/00187.jpg]Figure 178: … This hole, some nine feet across, is 310 feet and three rings ofheavily reinforced walls away from the impact point The authorities says that the lack of major pieces of wreckage can be explainedby the aircraft disintegrating and melting in the impact explosion, but at thesame time they say it was the nose cone that tore through three reinforced ringsof the building and caused the exit hole. How can both statements be true? Nosecones of commercial airliners are not strong enough to have been responsible forthat penetration of a building recently reinforced to defend the Pentagon fromsuch attacks. As one researcher put it:> The problem here is that the nose cone of a Boeing 757 is made of carbon-fibre> (like fibreglass); there is no metal nose cone on a 757. An average strength> man (or strong woman) could make mincemeat of a 757 nose cone in about 15> minutes with nothing more than a light axe or a sledgehammer – the same cannot> be said of the outer wall of the Pentagon. Punching through stone façade and> two exterior concrete and brick walls, four or more interior poured concrete> walls, and a poured concrete floor, to conveniently land front-and-center on a> piece of board for photographers, is out of the question. The lawn right in front of the impact point (Figure 179) remained as pristine asever, researchers point out, and they ask why, if the fireball was so hot thatit made a plane virtually disappear, that you see rooms in that section of thebuilding (Figure 180) with intact wooden chairs, books and computers? Thequestion I have about the Flight 77 controversy is this: why don’t theauthorities show us video footage, which they must have, of the plane crashinginto the building? If they can prove with non-doctored footage that Flight 77did hit the Pentagon then fine. As I say, this is not at all crucial to showingthat 9/11 was an inside job. But all these years after the event they have stillnot produced the pictures. Why? There are apparently more than eightysurveillance cameras around the Pentagon, as you would expect at theheadquarters of the US military, and several of them must have got a clearpicture of what hit the building. Yet, we have only been shown a lamentableexcuse for a ‘video’ of the impact and this has been dismissed by researchersand analysts as a blatant fake. Other surveillance videos, released from a gasstation across the road from the impact and a nearby hotel, do not show a 757hitting the building and even these had to be squeezed out of the authoritiesthrough the Freedom of Information Act. If Flight 77 did crash into the Pentagonthen put an end to the speculation and show us the pictures. To say they don’texist given the massive and constant surveillance of the Pentagon from everyangle is simply not credible.Image [../Images/00188.jpg]Figure 179: The unscathed lawn at the Pentagon Image [../Images/00189.jpg]Figure 180: Computers and a wooden chair were left undamaged when the Pentagonwas hit An airline pilot has stated publicly that a jet flying so fast and low wouldhave ‘tossed people and cars around like rag dolls if the official story wastrue’. The pilot said that claims by retired Army officer Frank Probst that hewas only six feet away when the plane passed him are a ‘ridiculousimpossibility’. Probst would have been ‘sucked into the engine like a bird in avacuum’ and the pilot said he had seen this happen to birds a hundred feet away.Cars alleged to have been twenty feet under the plane, as some witnesses haveclaimed, would have been devastated, he said, but they were not. Those witnesseswho said they were so close that they saw passengers in the plane, could neverhave done so because the speed would have made it a blur. Such claims were‘fantasy land’, he said. The pilot, who had considerable experience flying atlow altitudes, said he and other commercial airline pilots agreed that it wouldnot have been possible to fly so far while just twenty feet off the ground. Thepilot concluded that all the evidence suggests that a remotely-controlled GlobalHawk was used, not the 757 of Flight 77. He also suggested that one day thePentagon could release a perfect image of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon becausethe technology exists to fake anything to a level that would fool most people.If they did, my question would be: what kept you so long? Why have you withheldthis information from the public for all these years? I mentioned earlier thatno Arab names appeared on the passenger lists issued by the airlines, and DrThomas R. Olmsted, M.D, a former naval line officer and a psychiatrist inprivate practice in New Orleans, revealed that there were no Arabs on theautopsy list of Flight 77 either. Olmsted obtained the list through the Freedomof Information Act that claims to contain the names of those given autopsies bythe Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), which says it identified nearlyall the bodies on November 16th 2001. Olmsted said:> The AFIP suggest these numbers: 189 killed, 125 worked at the Pentagon and 64> were ‘passengers’ on the plane. The American Airlines list only had 56 and the> list just obtained has 58. They did not explain how they were able to tell> ‘victims’ bodies from ‘hijacker’ bodies. In fact, from the beginning NO> explanation has been given for the extra five suggested in news reports except> that the FBI showed us the pictures to make up the difference, and that makes> it so. > It seemed simple to me … produce the names of all the bodies identified by the> AFIP and compare it with the publicized list of passengers. So, I sent a> Freedom of Information Act request to the AFIP and asked for an expedited> response, because we were getting ready to send our boys to war on the pretext> that Osama/Saddam had done the deed. Fourteen months later, a few US soldiers> dead, many Iraqi civilians pushing up daisies, and I finally get the list.> Believe me that they weren’t a bit happy to give it up, and I really have no> idea why they choose now to release it. What he found was that no Arabs ended up in the mortuary, but three additionalpeople, not listed by American Airlines, appeared with no explanation. The newnames were Robert Ploger, Zandra Ploger and Sandra Teague. Nowhere are there anyArab names, let alone the specific ones named by the FBI as ‘hijackers’. This istrue of all four planes, not just Flight 77. All this only makes sense when youbegin to see what really happened on September 11th. This is the knowledge whichoffers explanations to these apparent mysteries. Those who question the Flight77 story suggest that the Pentagon could have been hit by either a cruisemissile or a remote-controlled plane smaller than a 757, possibly a Global Hawk.The account of Danielle O’Brien, an air traffic controller at Washington DullesAirport, described what appeared to be anything but a 757 commercial airliner onher radar screen, as it sped towards Washington: ‘I noticed the aircraft. It wasan unidentified plane to the southwest of Dulles, moving at a very high rate ofspeed … I had literally a blip and nothing more’. She asked her colleague, TomHowell, if he had seen it. ‘I said: “Oh my God, it looks like he’s headed to theWhite House”. I was yelling … “We’ve got a target headed right for the WhiteHouse!”’ At a speed of about 500 miles an hour, the plane was headed straightfor what is known as P-56, protected air space, which covers the White House andthe Capitol:> The speed, the manoeuvrability, the way that he turned, we all thought in the> radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that that was a> military plane. You don’t fly a 757 in that manner. It’s unsafe. The plane was> between 12 and 14 miles away and it was just a countdown. Ten miles west. Nine> miles west … Our supervisor picked up our line to the White House and started> relaying to them the information, [that] we have an unidentified very> fast-moving aircraft inbound toward your vicinity, 8 miles west. > And it went six, five, four, and I had it in my mouth to say, three, and all> of a sudden the plane turned away. In the room, it was almost a sense of> relief. This must be a fighter. This must be one of our guys sent in,> scrambled to patrol our capital, and to protect our president, and we sat back> in our chairs and breathed for just a second. Then came the fantastic 360-degree turn at high speed as it headed for thePentagon:> We lost radar contact with that aircraft. And we waited. And we waited. And> your heart is just beating out of your chest waiting to hear what’s happened.> And then the Washington National [Airport] controllers came over our speakers> in our room and said: > ‘Dulles, hold all of our inbound traffic. The Pentagon’s been hit’. It is certainly possible that Flight 77 was switched when contact was initiallylost and, whatever replaced it and struck the Pentagon, was not the plane thatleft Washington Dulles that morning. But I say again: if Flight 77 did hit thePentagon, as they claim, why don’t they release those conclusive tapes? By theway, Tony Snow, who became White House Press Secretary, told Fox News onSeptember 11th that the offices in the section of the Pentagon that was hit werefor the ‘new office of Homeland Defense’ and another that dealt with fightinglimited wars against terrorism. So the Homeland Defence operation was already inplace before 9/11 and only officially introduced afterwards using the attacks asthe excuse.Where is Flight 93?There are also some mysterious features of the Flight 93 story, the one that issupposed to have been hijacked by Islamic terrorists and crashed after the‘Let’s roll’ storming of the cockpit by passengers. The Pittsburgh Post Gazettereported on September 13th 2001 that human remains were found miles from thepoint of impact and that debris was scattered over a wide area up to eight milesfrom the crash crater. Some have claimed this was caused by the wind, but thewinds were light and there were mountains between the crater and some of the farflung debris. It is clear that the military were in a position to shoot downFlight 93. They could have brought it down, but did they? There was anextraordinary lack of wreckage at the crash site in Pennsylvania. So much sothat some researchers have concluded that the plane could not have crashed thereat all. Emergency services were not rushed to the scene and when volunteers andofficials turned up they were taken aback by what they found. We have all seenthe aftermath of plane crashes on the TV news and even aircraft that have fallenfrom tens of thousands of feet still have large pieces of the plane fairlyintact on the ground. Look at the scene at Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 where a747 was brought down from high altitude by a bomb (Figure 181), and there waseven significant wreckage when two planes collided in mid-air at 36,000 feetnear the German-Swiss border in 2002. But, in the case of Flight 93, policeinvestigators reported finding hardly a single piece of wreckage bigger than aphone book. Indeed, the wreckage of an enormous aircraft was mostly taken awayin buckets. How can this be? The plane was not at high altitude when it issupposed to have fallen to the ground, yet there was no substantial wreckage??All we are left with is a crater, and even then grass was still growing and wasnot burned. There is some burn damage to trees, but nothing even coming close towhat would have happened with a plane heavily laden with around 6,000 gallons ofjet fuel after completing so little of its journey to San Francisco.Image [../Images/00190.jpg]Figure 181: The scene at Lockerbie in Scotland after a 747 was brought down fromhigh altitude by a bomb Image [../Images/00191.jpg]Figure 182: What a different scene at what is claimed to be the location ofFlight 93’s demise One witness who was the first on the scene said he was stunned at how small thecrater looked (Figure 182). The Washington Post quoted him as saying that thescene ‘looked as if … someone took a scrap truck, dug a 10-foot ditch and dumpedall this trash into it’. Maybe he was very close to the truth. As the fictionaldetective, Sherlock Holmes, said: ‘When you have eliminated the impossible,whatever is left – however improbable – must be the truth’. Some researcherssuggest that the explosion which people saw (but not the actual impact) camefrom the ground. For sure, it could not have come from the plane or it wouldhave been far more powerful and the crash scene would have reflected that, butit clearly didn’t. The BBC produced an hilarious ‘documentary’ about 9/11 in2007 that supported the official line and dismissed these questions about Flight93. They even showed a picture of the red head scarf, or ‘bandana’, found at thescene to prove that the official story stood up. This bandana was worn by one ofthe ‘hijackers’, the government version claims. Ridiculously little wreckage andno hijackers were recovered from the site, but one of their bandanas survived!It was in remarkably pristine condition for something that was around someone’shead when the plane fell from the sky (Figure 183). What a joke it all is. Thisis almost as insane as the paper passport of one of the ‘hijackers’ that the FBIclaimed to have ‘found’ a few streets from the World Trade Center. It was neverexplained how a paper passport could have survived the fireball that destroyedthe plane it was travelling in and, once again, there is a good reason for this.The story is nonsense.Image [../Images/00192.jpg]Figure 183: A pristine bandana ‘used by one of the hijackers’ that is claimed tohave been found at the scene. Oh, please Controlled demolitionThe defining moment of 9/11 was the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York. Itproduced a level of revulsion and horror that even eclipsed everything else thathappened that day. It was pointed out by many at the time that both collapseslooked remarkably like the controlled demolitions that you see on television.These happen after days, often weeks of preparation, to carefully positioncharges that bring down vast skyscrapers and stadiums, so they collapse onto theland on which they stood. The Twin Towers looked like controlled demolitionsbecause they were (Figure 184). The official explanation that intense firecaused the steel girders to soften is an insult to the most basic ofintelligence (Figure 185, overleaf). In the case of the South Tower, we sawwhere most of the fire and aircraft fuel went – it exploded into the air outsidethe building in a fireball as the plane struck. It has been claimed that thebuildings were undermined by the impact of the aircraft, but Hyman Brown, theconstruction manager of the towers, said: ‘They were over-designed to withstandalmost anything, including hurricanes … bombings and an airplane …’ Otherconstruction engineers have made the same point. As Thomas Eagar, a professor ofmaterials engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: ‘… thenumber of columns lost on the initial impact was not large and the loads wereshifted to remaining columns in this highly redundant structure’. All officialfingers point to the effect of the fire, but the temperature where steel beginsto melt is around 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit while jet fuel can reach a maximum ofabout 1,700 degrees. The fires were not even hot enough to credibly buckle thesteel, and the evidence from the colour of the smoke and communications fromfirefighters very close to the seat of the fire indicate that the heat wasnowhere near what it needed to be for the official story to have any credencewhatsoever. The South Tower was struck between the 78th and 84th floors and firedepartment audio recordings reveal that a fire officer called the ground fromthe 78th floor and said there were only ‘two isolated pockets of fire’. BrianClark, a survivor from the South Tower, passed through the 80th floor, right inthe impact zone, but he said: ‘You could see through the wall and the cracks andsee flames . . . just licking up, not a roaring inferno, just quiet flameslicking up and smoke sort of eking through the wall’. Yet the official storysays it was the heat from this fire that caused the South Tower to collapse onitself in just fifty-six minutes when steel doesn’t melt until it reaches astaggering 2,800 degrees. This is why no other major steel-framed building hadever collapsed because of fire – not ever. If the official version is true, whydid the South Tower collapse well before the North Tower, which took an hour andforty-two minutes to come down despite having bigger fires burning for longer?In 2005, the Windsor Building in Madrid was a raging inferno and tooktwenty-four hours to extinguish, but it did not collapse (Figure 186).Image [../Images/00193.jpg]Figure 184: The Twin Towers were brought down by controlled demolition Image [../Images/00194.jpg]Figure 185: ‘Earthlings will believe anything’ The official lie is that when the steel girders failed on one floor, itcollapsed and started a ‘pancake’ sequence in which that floor collapsed thefloor below, and so on. The claim is that the heat caused horizontal columns,which held up the actual floors, to break away from the forty-seven massivevertical columns that ran through the core of the building from ground to roof.If the horizontal columns had broken away from the vertical central core, thatcore would have been left standing. But it wasn’t. That came down too. When afloor hits another floor and another floor in the way they described, there isresistance before each new floor gives way, especially near the start. On 9/11,however, the speed that the two buildings collapsed was free-fall speed – thespeed of dropping something from mid-air with nothing in the way until it hitthe ground. This only happens with … controlled demolitions when explosivecharges remove all resistence. We all remember those fantastic clouds of dustwhen the towers fell and this is yet another classic feature of a controlleddemolition. Buildings that collapse ‘naturally’ do not produce the power fromgravity alone to pulverise everything into small pieces and vast clouds of dust.With controlled demolitions, the multiple explosions do exactly that, as you’llsee in any documentary about these orchestrated collapses, or any shots of themon the Internet. It’s a good idea to search the Internet for videos ofcontrolled demolitions and you’ll see all the elements that were there when theTwin Towers collapsed. When they are expertly charged, the buildings comestraight down without falling to one side, because that’s the way controlleddemolitions are planned to protect other property in the area. There is also themomentary delay after the charges go off before the buildings start to fall –another tell-tale confirmation of a controlled demolition. For goodness sake,when you look at slow-motion video of the collapse of the towers and World TradeCenter Building 7, which came down hours later, you can see the classic puffs ofsmoke project outward from the building just before the collapse – preciselywhat you see with buildings brought down by controlled demolition (Figures 187and 188, overleaf). If you go to the 9/11 research archive at www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com], you will be able to see this and much more in videoreports and analysis. There is an excellent documentary in the archive headed‘9/11 Mysteries’ that I highly recommend. It utterly destroys the official storyof the building collapses. Jerry Russell PhD, who has a Master’s Degree inEngineering at Stanford University, points out that steel frame towers are builtvery strongly and are almost impossible to destroy. He says that aircraftstrikes do not destroy skyscrapers and neither does fire. No skyscraper had everbeen brought down by a fire, he points out, and if a big enough impact by aplane ever destabilised a building the structural failure would happen ‘… at thepoint of highest levered stress, near the base of the tower, and the tower wouldhave fallen over like a giant tree in a forest windstorm’. Like many with hisbackground who have gone public since 9/11, Jerry Russell says that the mosteffective way to make a skyscraper collapse is by controlled demolition:> As your eyes will tell you, the World Trade Center collapses looked like> controlled demolitions. Here’s the proof. According to the law of gravity, it> is possible to calculate the time it takes for an object to fall a given> distance. The equation is H=(1/2)at2, where H is the height, a is the> acceleration of gravity (10 meters per second squared) and t is time in> seconds. Plug in the height of the building at 1350 feet (411 meters) and we> get 9 seconds. That is just about the length of time it took for the very top> of the World Trade Center to fall to the street below. According to all> reports, the whole thing was over in just about ten seconds. Image [../Images/00195.jpg]Figure 186: The Windsor Building skyscraper in Madrid burned with extraordinaryintensity in 2005 and took 24 hours to put out, but the building did not fall Image [../Images/00196.jpg]Figure 187: Explosive charges going off in World Trade Center Building 7 beforeit collapsed in a classic controlled demolition Image [../Images/00197.jpg]Figure 188: An explosive charge projects from the wall as a controlleddemolition brings down the South Tower > It is as if the entire building were falling straight down through thin air.> As if the entire solid structure below, the strong part which had not been> burned or sliced or harmed in any significant way, just disappeared into> nothingness. Yet this (within a small tolerance) is what we would expect to> find if there had been a controlled demolition, because the explosions below> really do leave the upper stories completely unsupported. Like the Road Runner> after he runs off the edge of the cliff, the entire building pauses a moment,> then goes straight down. > Any kind of viscous process or friction process should have slowed the whole> thing down. Like dropping a lead ball into a vat of molasses, or dropping a> feather into the air, gravitational acceleration cannot achieve its full> effect if it is fighting any opposing force. In the case of the World Trade> Center, the intact building below should have at least braked the fall of the> upper stories. This did not happen. There was no measurable friction at all. > This proves controlled demolition. The ‘pancake collapse’ theory is just another smokescreen to hide what reallyhappened – pre-planned demolition by those who would use this horror to unleashtheir agenda of human control and wars of conquest. Firefighters talked ofhearing explosions in the building, and so did William Rodriguez, a janitor fortwenty years at the World Trade Center, who was in the basement of the NorthTower on 9/11 when the first plane struck. He helped many people to safety andwas honoured five times at the White House until he began to speak publiclyabout hearing bombs go off in the building. He gave evidence to the 9/11Commission, which was ignored in the final report, and he has become awell-known advocate for a truly independent inquiry into what happened. He tellshis story in the documentary headed ‘9/11 Mysteries’ in my website archive.There were so many eyewitness reports of explosions before the towers came down.These are just a few from firefighters and paramedics:> Battalion Chief John Sudnik: ‘We heard … what sounded like a loud explosion> and looked up and I saw tower two start coming down’. > Paramedic Kevin Darnowski: ‘I heard three explosions, and then … tower two> started to come down’. > Firefighter Thomas Turilli: ‘… it almost sounded like bombs going off, like> boom, boom, boom, like seven or eight’. > Firefighter Craig Carlsen: ‘[We] heard explosions coming from . . . the South> Tower. . . . There were about ten explosions. . . . We then realised the> building started to come down’. > Firefighter Joseph Meola: ‘… it looked like the building was blowing out on> all four sides. We actually heard the pops’. > Paramedic Daniel Rivera: ‘It was a frigging noise. At first I thought it was –> do you ever see professional demolition where they set the charges on certain> floors and then you hear “Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop?” … I thought it was that.’ It was. The ‘pop, pop, pop’ sounds are the multiple charges going off that areplanted around buildings prepared for a controlled demolition. The pops arefollowed by a brief moment before the entire building falls with all resistanceremoved. Hence, it comes down at free-fall speed. The preparation and theplanting of the charges would have meant significant access to the building inthe weeks before, but that was no problem with the World Trade Center. PresidentBoy Bush’s brother, Marvin Bush, and his cousin, Wirt Walker III, were on theboard of a company called Stratesec (formerly Securacom) in Sterling, Virginia,which has been backed by another company associated with the Bush family, theinvestment firm Kuwait-American Corp. Stratesec provided security for the WorldTrade Center, Washington Dulles Airport and American Airlines in the period upto, and including, September 11th.Building 7: ‘Pull it’.The other World Trade Center building to collapse that day was theforty-seven-storey Building 7, also known as the Salomon Brothers Building. Onceagain, we were led to believe that another miracle of physics occurred when heatcaused this building to collapse, even though no aircraft came near it. This wasanother blatant controlled demolition that was confirmed by Khazar–Sumerian,Larry Silverstein, who bought the World Trade Center lease and massivelyincreased the insurance just six months before 9/11. The collapse of Building 7alone led to a payout of $861 million from Industrial Risk Insurers, based onthe official story of what happened. But, in September 2002, Silverstein told aPBS television documentary that he had been told the building was so badlydamaged they wanted to ‘pull it’. This term is used by the demolition industryand emergency services, as short hand for ‘pull it down’ – demolish it.Silverstein made a major mistake here. He has tried to deny the implications bysaying that ‘pull it’ meant something else, but what that ‘something else’ was,old Larry ain’t saying. Of course, there is no ‘something else’, it’s just thathe’s been caught with his pants down. A bewildered Senator John Kerry, fendingoff questions about 9/11 at a public event in Texas in 2007, said that hisinformation was that Building 7 had been brought down by a controlleddemolition. When Building 7 collapsed, even the CBS News anchor, Dan Rather,said that it was …’reminiscent of ... when a building was deliberately destroyedby well-placed dynamite to knock it down’. That’s what happened, confirmed bySilverstein and the video shots of the explosive charges going off that you canfind in the 9/11 archive at www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com]. Thereis some excellent footage in an Italian television documentary which includesthe sounds of the explosions going off as the building falls. You can see thisin the 9/11 archive by clicking the headline: ‘Major Italian TV network:conclusive evidence that WTC Building 7 was demolished with explosives’. Anumber of emergency personnel and volunteers have said they were told longbefore the building fell at 5.20 pm that it was going to be ‘pulled’ or that itwas ‘coming down’. One was Indira Singh, a volunteer civilian Emergency MedicalTechnician, and Senior Consultant for JP Morgan Chase. She was setting up sitesfor the injured on September 11th and she said on American radio that the firedepartment had said of Building 7: ‘We’re gonna have to bring it down’. KevinMcPadden, a search and rescue volunteer formerly with Air Force SpecialOperations, was stationed at a Red Cross operations center on the afternoon of9/11. He also said he was told that Building 7 was going to be brought down:> They said you know you’ve got to stay behind this line because they’re> thinking about taking this building down, they’re not sure if it’s stable or> not, so they were holding a line off because they had knowledge that something> was gonna happen. Well, they pushed us back a little bit … a couple of minutes> later they started coming down … people started coming back out to the street,> I watched five New York City buses jam packed with people wanting to do search> and rescue, head down there towards Building 7 – people walk out into the> middle of the street to see these people off, like bon voyage and right then> Building 7 came down. Building 7 was in the news again, on the Internet at least, when it emerged inFebruary 2007 that the BBC and CNN reported that the building had collapsedbefore it actually did. BBC correspondent, Jane Standley, announced thatBuilding 7 had collapsed some twenty-six minutes before it came down and thebuilding can even be seen still standing behind her while she reported itsdemise. When questioned about this, the BBC made the bizarre and ridiculousstatement that all recordings of its live coverage on 9/11 had been ‘lost’. TheBBC typically said that to accuse it of being part of a conspiracy over Building7 was ludicrous, but that was not what was being suggested. The question was notabout a BBC ‘conspiracy’, but who told them, and CNN, at least half an hourbefore Building 7 came down that it had already done so? On this, the BBC wassilent.Now, here’s the killer point in all this. It can take weeks to place explosivecharges into large buildings to make them fall in the controlled way that theydo, yet Building 7 came down just hours after the attacks in a perfectcontrolled-demolition collapse. There is no way it could have been prepared andall the charges placed in the short time they had. The building must have beencharged before the attacks, just like the Twin Towers. Former German DefenceMinister and intelligence expert, Andreas Von Bülow, believes that Building 7was a command bunker during the attacks and that it was ‘pulled’ to destroy theevidence. Certainly, two years before the attacks Rudolph Giuliani, the deeplyunpleasant and untrustworthy Mayor of New York, had opened a $13 million CommandCenter on the 23rd floor of the building. It was designed to respond toemergencies like terrorism. Von Bülow called the location the ‘optimal place’ toorchestrate the attacks: ‘There were two procedures, one was flying in theaircraft, the second was the explosions’, he said. Giuliani, or ‘IlluminatiMan’, announced in early 2007 that he was running for President. He cultivatesan image as the ‘hero’ mayor of 9/11, but New York firefighters tell a verydifferent story about this vicious man. He sent in the firefighters and otherrescue and clean up workers after the attacks when the Environmental ProtectionAgency knew that it was lethal to breathe the toxic air at Ground Zero, whichincluded large quantities of asbestos, the infamous agent of lung disease andcancer. Giuliani sent them in because he demanded: ‘The stock market mustre-open’. Yeah, let’s get our priorities right. Firefighters and theircolleagues are suffering appallingly and dying from the consequences whileGiuliani milks 9/11 to advance his political status and line his pockets.One other point with regard to the collapse of the Twin Towers and Building 7has been highlighted by physicist, Dr Stephen Jones, at Brigham YoungUniversity. He says there is unmistakable evidence of the use of thermite and aderivative, thermate, to cut through pillars. These substances are used to slicethrough hardened steel ‘like a knife through butter’. Jones says that hot yellowmolten metal with white ash or dust floating away, all of which were clearlyseen in the burning buildings, is the ‘signature’ of thermite. ‘Thermite had tobe planted in the building, which of course implies directly an inside job’, hesaid. ‘Someone had to have had access’. Every aspect of the official fairytalefalls in the face of the most basic questions, because 9/11 is nothing but atapestry of lies, inconsistencies and impossibilities. It is a cover story and,therefore, a lie from start to finish. When one lie is exposed, another isdrafted in to man the barricades.Manufacturing miraclesNo Arab names appear on the passenger lists issued by the airlines, but, withindays of the attacks, the FBI was able to name ‘nineteen hijackers’ and producetheir photographs. Seven of these ‘hijackers’ have since been found to be stillalive and yet the FBI has not changed its list of those it claims wereresponsible. It talks simply of ‘stolen identities’, as one lie is produced tocover up another. Incidentally, I remember saying on one of those ‘shock jock’talk radio shows in America that seven of the alleged hijackers had been locatedalive, and I asked how that could be if the official story was true. What didthese ‘hijackers’ do – parachute? ‘Are you saying they survived the crashes’,the shock jock asked, shockingly. ‘No mate’,’ I replied after catching mybreath, ‘they weren’t on the planes’. Ain’t the media just great? To shore upthe official baloney, we were treated to some incredible fairy stories. Onecracker that I’ve already mentioned was the claim that the passport of one ofthe hijackers had been ‘found’ near Ground Zero shortly after 9/11. A BBCnewsreader earnestly told us this story without even the hint of a smile, letalone the belly laugh it deserved. To the unquestioning minds at the BBC, thenews had come from the FBI and so must be true. They held a press conference toannounce this momentous find of a paper passport that had survived the fireball,and wafted down amid rubble and dust to be found by a passer-by. I mean, was iteven singed? It was a lie, of course it was, and part of the web of deceit beingconstructed to underpin the movie called ‘The Muslims Did It’. A year aftercalling a press conference to reveal the ‘find’ the FBI told a UK televisionteam that the hijacker’s passport ‘… was a rumour that might be true’. Or,rather, it was a calculated lie from the start.Official cover stories often require miracles to stand up and the September 11thfable is full of them. Of all the passengers in all the world, it had to be the‘baggage’ of Mohamed Atta, the alleged ‘lead hijacker’, that didn’t make it ontoFlight 11. What a stroke of unbelievable luck. It allowed the authorities tofind a handheld electronic flight computer; a simulator procedures manual forBoeing 757 and 767 aircraft; two videotapes relating to ‘air tours’ of theBoeing 757 and 747 aircraft; a slide-rule flight calculator; a copy of theKoran; Atta’s passport; his will; his international driver’s license; areligious cassette tape; airline uniforms; a letter of recommendation and‘education related documentation’. Talk about a B-movie script. It’s pathetic.Some questions: Why was his passport in a bag due to be in the hold when hewould have needed that to get through security onto the aircraft; and, withouthis passport, how did he get through security onto the Flight 11? Why would heneed any baggage at all when he was apparently about to kill himself?A five-page document detailing the plot and how his fellow ‘hijackers’ shouldprepare for the attacks was also alleged to have been found in ‘Atta’s bag’.Copies were found in the alleged hire car of another ‘hijacker’ and in the‘nothing-bigger-than-a-phone-book’ wreckage of Flight 93, we are told. What theAtta document says was clearly not written by an Islamic fanatic and I take thisfantasy apart in Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster. Onenewspaper said the note suggested ‘an almost Christian view of what thehijackers might have felt’, and it added that if the note is genuine then [they]believed in a very exclusive version of Islam – or were surprisingly unfamiliarwith their religion’. Maybe document creators at the FBI or CIA don’t tend to beIslamic fanatics. The silly fakers. Another newspaper reported that the Attanote was ‘certainly very fortunate, though some might think them a little toofortunate’. Yeah, just a bit, but the cover story conveyor never stops at theMiracle Factory. The ‘certainly very fortunate’ Atta ‘finds’ were produced bythe same people who would later uncover evidence in wrecked buildings in Baghdadto connect Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein, and a financial scam to BritishMember of Parliament, George Galloway, who just happened to be one of theloudest and most vociferous critics of the invasion of Iraq.Some other convenient miracles to ponder:> •A ‘hijacker’s’ rental car was found at Boston’s Logan Airport with an Arabic> language flight manual, a pass giving access to restricted areas, and> paperwork naming ‘other suspects’. It also named a flight school in Florida> called Huffman Aviation, of which more later.> •A car registered to another ‘hijacker’ was discovered at Washington Dulles> Airport with a copy of Atta’s letter to the other hijackers, a cheque made out> to a flight school in Phoenix, drawings of the cockpit of a 757, a box cutter> or knife, and maps of Washington and New York.> •A rental car was found in an airport car park in Portland, Maine, where Atta,> and another alleged hijacker, are said to have spent the night before the> attacks. This gave the authorities access to finger prints and DNA samples. A> FedEx bill is alleged to have been found in the rubbish bin at Atta’s Portland> hotel, which links him to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.> •A hotel owner in Florida found a box cutter in a room and when he checked the> rubbish bin he discovered a bag with ‘Boeing 757 manuals, three illustrated> martial arts books, an 8-inch stack of East Coast flight maps, a three-ring> binder full of handwritten notes, an English-German dictionary, an airplane> fuel tester, and a protractor’.> •The night before the attacks some of these ‘Islamic extremists’ attended a> stripper bar and loudly predicted what would happen the next day.

Credit card> receipts linking the ‘hijackers’ to flight training schools were also located,> we are told.All this and more was part of the pre-arranged set up in which the targets wereframed. Once the attacks happened, the ‘finds’ were activated to support theofficial story. I lost count of the number of Korans that were found – theyseemed to leave them everywhere. Who were these people, the Islamic equivalentof the Gideons? It is all so transparent and ridiculous, and what does that sayabout the overwhelming majority of ‘journalists’ and the global public whobought this blatant nonsense and still do? The New Yorker magazine said of theseremarkable ‘finds’: ‘Whatever trail was left was left deliberately – for the FBIto chase’. No, let’s go further … the FBI and other agencies were chasing the‘trail’ they left for themselves. This extraordinary catalogue of contradictionsand impossibilities were ignored by the Cheney-controlled ‘9/11 Commission’,which was designed to suppress the truth while appearing to seek it. Even thered-flag stock market activity immediately before the attacks, which revealedobvious pre-knowledge, was left uninvestigated for fear of what they knew wouldbe found. These were the so-called ‘put options’ that involved highly unusualtransactions that would make the investor a fortune if airline stocks went downin the period after 9/11. As a result of the attacks, that’s precisely whathappened. It was an obvious lead, but was left to wither to avoid a collapse ofthe dominoes.There were three main elements to the Reptilian hybrid 9/11 conspiracy: (1) Toengineer the attacks; (2) To prevent the normal response from NORAD and the FAAthat could have stopped the attacks; (3) To block any investigations by thelower and genuine levels of intelligence and investigative agencies that couldhave uncovered the plot, or aspects of it. The first two were the responsibilityof the Cheney–Joint Chiefs–NORAD axis of evil, supported by the NationalSecurity Agency, or NSA, the godfather of the CIA. Number three, wasorchestrated through the same network, but also involved the top levels of theCIA, headed by George Tenent, and the FBI, led by Robert Mueller who becameagency director just two weeks before September 11th. As Leroy Fletcher Proutysaid:> No one has to direct an assassination – it happens. The active role is played> secretly by permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has> the power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions? One man the conspirators had to eliminate was John O’Neill, the FBI’s formerDeputy Director and head of the Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York. Theproblem with him was that he was genuine and not one of the Crazy Gang. He hadshown his refusal to capitulate to manipulation from above in his investigationsinto the funding of ‘al- Qaeda’, the terrorist attack on the USS Cole in 2000,and the case of Israeli ‘art students’ who were considered to be actingsuspiciously in the months before 9/11 in locations later connected to the‘hijackers’. O’Neill ignored official interference in all these investigationsand his pursuit of Osama bin Laden, but he was extremely upset by it. Two weeksbefore September 11th, O’Neil resigned from the FBI because he believed the BushAdministration was blocking FBI investigations into terrorism. He told theauthors of the book, Hidden Truth (or Forbidden Truth in the US version): ‘Themain obstacles to investigate Islamic terrorism were US oil corporate interestsand the role played by Saudi Arabia in it.’ One of the authors, Charles Brisard,said that O’Neill had complained bitterly that the US State Department and theBush oil lobby had undermined attempts to prove Bin Laden’s involvement interrorist activity. Even after leaving the FBI, O’Neill’s insider knowledge asBin Laden’s chief pursuer would have been devastating to the 9/11 conspiracy.However, the orchestrators had another stroke of ‘luck’. John O’Neil left theFBI when he was offered a job as head of security at … the World Trade Center.He was at his desk on the 34th floor of the North Tower when the plane stuck. Hecalled his son and a friend to say he was fine, but then he is alleged to havecalled the FBI and gone back into the building to help others. We have only theFBI’s word that this is what happened and that’s not worth a dime. Either way, avery dangerous man to the conspirators was dead.Funny how those with knowledge that could expose the lies so often end up deadat the most convenient times. People like John O’Neill, who could have revealedhow investigations into Bin Laden and terrorism had been systematically blockedbefore 9/11; David Kelly, the British weapons inspector who knew that the Blairgovernment was lying and ‘sexing up’ claims about ‘weapons of mass destruction’in Iraq; and Robin Cook, the former British Foreign Secretary, who resigned overthe Iraq war and was starting to speak out over the lies and deceptions of theofficial story. John O’Neil was not alone at the FBI or CIA in facing officialopposition to terrorist investigations. American journalist, Greg Palast,produced a report on the subject for the BBC current affairs programme,Newsnight, in which he said he had received a phone call from a high-placedmember of a US intelligence agency:> He tells me that while there’s always been constraints on investigating> Saudis, under George Bush it’s gotten much worse. After the [2000] elections,> the agencies were told to ‘back off’ investigating the Bin Ladens and Saudi> royals, and that angered agents. Other FBI operatives have gone public since 9/11 to say the same. Robert Wright,an FBI agent in Chicago, said his investigation into a terrorist cell was closedby FBI headquarters in the run up to September 11th. Lawyer David Schippers, whohas represented FBI whistleblowers like Robert Wright, said he tried for sixweeks before 9/11 to tell Attorney General John Ashcroft about informationprovided by FBI agents of ‘upcoming attacks in lower Manhattan’. As I documentin Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster, there are majorconnections between the Bush family, the Bin Ladens, and their constructionoperation out of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi ‘royal’ fascist elite, theHouse of Saud, who are claimed by some researchers to be descendants of a Jewish(i.e. Sumerian) merchant who lived in what is now Iraq in the 9th century beforesettling in Diriyah (near the present-day capital, Riyadh) from where the Houseof Saud officially emerged. See ethnikoi.org/saudi.htm. Saudi Arabia is one ofmany 51st states of America. The Bin Ladens and the Saudi ‘royal’ family havebeen clients of the Carlyle Group of Father George Bush, his former Secretary ofState, James Baker, and the Neocon former Defense Secretary and number two atthe CIA, Frank Carlucci. The Carlyle Group, which specialises in ‘defence’contracts, has benefited massively from the policies of Boy Bush and theNeocons. Apparently, Father Bush was meeting with Osama bin Laden’s brother,Shafig bin Laden, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Washington DC on the morning of9/11 – just a coincidence, nothing to worry about. Days after September 11th, aprivate chartered jet was allowed to leave Boston Logan Airport with at leasteleven members of the Bin Laden family heading for Saudi Arabia at a time whenBush was telling the world: ‘We must get Bin Laden’. Thousands of Muslims, andeven people who looked like Muslims, were being arrested without charge all overthe United States and held at secret locations that not even their lawyers wereallowed to know, but the Bin Laden family were given free passage back to thesafety of Saudi Arabia. The Reptilian hybrids were looking after their own. Theconnection between those blamed for terrorism, like Bin Laden, and thoseclaiming to ‘fight terrorism’, like the Bushes, is a constant theme. Tounderstand 9/11, and the global conspiracy in general, we need to lose thisperception of different ‘sides’ and realise that we are dealing with one sideworking to one end.The Reptilian-hybrid Illuminati had all bases covered that tragic September day.They controlled those elements of the military and the Joint Chiefs of Staffthat ran the technology to electronically hijack the planes and quite possiblyreplace them with remotely-guided aircraft in line with Operation Northwoods.They controlled, through Cheney, the Joint Chiefs and elements within NORAD, the‘wargames’ that mirrored real events and confused and delayed the normalresponse procedures. They controlled the upper levels of the intelligence andinvestigative agencies to stop genuine agents uncovering the plot.They must have thought they had got away with it, but they haven’t. The clock isticking and its hands are moving ever quicker."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 16 The seamless web > Never do anything against conscience, even if the state demands it. > Albert Einstein From the moment the story broke of a ‘terror plot’ to explode passenger planesin mid- Atlantic in August 2006, I was waiting for the first mention of the‘Pakistan connection’. Even more so, I was waiting for the letters ‘ISI’.Neither took long to arrive.The ‘ISI’ is Inter-Services Intelligence, which, in reality, is the Pakistanbranch of the CIA and runs a state within a state on behalf of the Reptilianhybrid agenda. If the ISI is involved in any way, in any situation or event,then all is not as it seems. There is, for example, a fundamental link betweenthe ISI, September 11th and ‘lead hijacker’ Mohamed Atta, as I shall detail. Theconnections between apparently unconnected ‘intelligence agencies’ is anothernetwork that serves the web. At the highest levels of control, higher than thosewho are officially in charge, the major intelligence agencies are the sameorganisation. These agencies connect into the secret societies, which often act,like P-2, as the coordinating channels through which multiple agencies operateto the same end. This includes apparently deeply opposed organisations like theIsraeli Mossad and those agencies officially representing Arab countries.Intelligence agencies are satanic cults at their core and their leaders areinvariably occultists worshipping the Reptilian ‘gods’ through the Sun god–Moongoddess ‘religion’ of Babylon. Within this structure, there is always rivalryand competition – that’s the nature of the personalities attracted to suchcovert operations. But, when you reach the very top, they act in unison. Thelower ranks will not know of this unity because of the compartmentalisation ofthe pyramid. The transatlantic ‘terror plot’ and 9/11 are good examples of thissystem at work. We were told that the ‘plot’– which allegedly involved blowingup aircraft with ‘liquid explosives’ put together on the plane – was ‘uncovered’after two British brothers of Pakistani descent were arrested by the ISI inKarachi and Lahore. Already the credibility of a genuine, rather thanmanufactured, ‘plot’ was in tatters – especially when we were told that theseISI arrests were made in ‘a coordinated operation with British and Americanintelligence agencies’. All three ‘agencies’ are terrorist organisations, whocreate and fund the very ‘terrorist groups’ they later claim to have‘uncovered’. The News in Islamabad reported on August 12th, 2006:> The plot to blow up passenger planes bound for the US from Britain by making> bombs on board was revealed for the first time by Pakistan’s prime> intelligence agency, which then brought it into the notice of its counterpart> agencies in the US and the UK … The agencies of all the three countries then> launched a successful operation in unison to foil the plot. Well-placed> sources revealed to The News on condition of anonymity that the operation was> coordinated at the highest level by all the three agencies.

Gen Kiyani, who> is director-general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), returned from> London only last week. The ISI chief and senior aides travelled regularly to> the West and even across the Atlantic in this endeavour, and not only> unearthed the plot but also rendered tangible assistance with precision in> nabbing the suspects. Yes, he returned from London a few days before where the final details of thescam were agreed. First of all, the ISI’s methods of ‘interrogation’ makeanything you have seen in pictures from American prisons in Iraq look like teawith your granny. Nothing that a ‘suspect’ says when ‘questioned’ by thesemind-sick morons has a shred of believability on this basis alone. But it goesfurther. The ISI is a notorious sponsor of the very terror groups it wasclaiming to be exposing in this ‘liquid bomb plot’ and it is one of the primevehicles through which manufactured terror organisations are created and fundedon behalf of its masters in the US and Britain. I have been exposing itsactivities for years. The ISI is a military operation and its director generalhas to be a serving Lieutenant General in the Pakistan Army. It controls thegovernment headed by Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistan President and chief of thearmy who took power in a coup in 1999. Pakistan, dubbed the ‘Land of the Pure’by the inventor of its name, is, in truth, a blatant military dictatorship withclose ties to a stream of engineered terrorist groups and the intelligenceagencies of the US, UK and elsewhere.Training the terroristsThe ISI was a primary source of funding for Osama bin Laden on behalf of theUnited States and was massively involved in the manipulation of 9/11. After theUS covertly provoked the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, asadmitted by President Carter’s National Security Advisor and Barack Obamamentor, the Trilateral Commission’s Zbigniew Brzezinski, tens of millions ofdollars were funnelled to Afghanistan resistance groups called the Mujahideen.These would later become the Taliban and ‘al-Qaeda’. The money came from theUnited States and Saudi Arabia and was largely managed and distributed to theMujahideen by the ISI across the border in Pakistan. The front man for theresistance to the Soviet occupation was Osama bin Laden, the stooge of the CIAand the Saudi ‘royal’ family, and the CIA database of Mujahideen personnel isthe origin of the name ‘al-Qaeda’. It literally means ‘the base or database’, asformer British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook revealed a month before he died froma heart attack. Cook wrote in the UK Guardian on July 8th, 2005:> Throughout the 80s [Bin Laden] was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis> to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida,> literally ‘the database’, was originally the computer file of the thousands of> Mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the> Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to> have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden’s> organisation would turn its attention to the West. The only point I would challenge is that the US authorities ‘inexplicably’didn’t see the ‘disastrous consequences’ coming. Oh, but they did because thatwas the plan, and the ISI would continue to be a major bag carrier and conduitfor funds and training to manufacture the subsequent ‘war on terror’. You can’thave a war on terror unless you have the ‘terror’ in the first place and thatwas, and is, a major role of the ISI. In 1984, Bin Laden located himself inPeshawar, just across the Afghan border in Pakistan. Even the mainstream MSNBCin America reported in 1998 that his organisation, Maktab al- Khidamar (MAK),was ‘nurtured by Pakistan’s state security services, the Inter-ServicesIntelligence agency, or ISI, the CIA’s primary conduit for conducting the covertwar against Moscow’s occupation’. One of the main financial vehicles for fundingthis and other terrorist networks was the BCCI, the Bank of Credit and CommerceInternational, or, more accurately, the Bank of Crooks and CriminalsInternational as it was known after its crash amid enormous scandal in 1991. Itwas a front for drug money laundering and for intelligence agencies financingterrorist operations. The full enormity of its activities was covered up by thethen President of the United States, Father George Bush, and British PrimeMinister John Major, who would later be European head of the Bush–connectedCarlyle Group, advisors to the Bin Laden family. The bank was based in Pakistan,where it opened in 1972, and it had extremely close ties with … the ISI. A greatdeal of the funding for Bin Laden’s operation came from heroin after opiumproduction in Mujahideen-controlled Afghan territories soared from 250 tons in1982 to 2,000 tons in 1991. Bin Laden and the ISI were reaping a reported $100million a year in a deal that had Mujahideen ‘warlords’ paying an opium tax, andthese drugs were sold on the world market with the full knowledge andcooperation of the CIA. In fact, the CIA/Illuminati control the maindrug-running operation on the planet. The United Nations Drug Control Programsaid in 1999 that the ISI was making around $2.5 billion annually from the saleof illegal drugs. As Time magazine reported on April 29th 2002:> Even by the shadowy standards of spy agencies, the ISI is notorious. It is> commonly branded ‘a state within the state’, or Pakistan’s ‘invisible> government’. It has sponsored Muslim rebels in Indian-held Kashmir, and> propped up the Taliban and by extension its malevolent Arab guests in> Afghanistan – though it denies these charges. Its tentacles stretch into> Pakistani politics, courts and everyday life. It is much feared; a venal> whisper from an ISI informer can destroy a career or lead to arrest – or> worse. This is the organisation, lest we forget, that ‘uncovered’ the ‘plot’ to bombmultiple airliners over the Atlantic that led to the arrest of twenty-fourpeople who had no bombs, no plane tickets and many not even passports. It alsotriggered the insane airport ‘security’ measures that caused enormousdisruption, chaos and fear, and included a ban on hand luggage and even babymilk unless it was ‘tested’ in front of security staff. These measures wereintroduced via UK Home Secretary John Reid, the ‘political bully’ who was reallya manipulated babe-in-arms and, like the overwhelming majority of politiciansworldwide, probably clueless about the forces involved. The CIA, Britain’s MI6and the ISI created and oversaw ‘training camps’ in Pakistan that coached morethan 100,000 Muslims in the art of terrorism and bomb-making between 1986 and1992, according to real journalist John Pilger. The Soviet Union leftAfghanistan in 1989 and only 43,000 of this 100,000 actually took part in thewar! The ‘elite’ British special forces unit, the SAS, was involved in thetraining in Pakistan, while those Muslims selected for leadership roles went toa camp in Virginia under a project called Operation Cyclone. Richard Murphy, anAssistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Relations during theReagan-Bush administration, later said: ‘We did spawn a monster in Afghanistan’.Pakistan President Benazir Bhutto told the US President Father George Bush thathe was ‘creating a Frankenstein’, but that’s exactly what Bush wanted to do. Hewas creating the potential terrorists across the world that his son, or someother place-man, was scheduled to ‘fight’ at a later stage. As I have beenstressing all these years, the Reptilian agenda is projected forward decades andmore – often much more. In late 2001, the training of terrorists by the UnitedStates government was confirmed in an investigation by the excellent Americanjournalist Greg Palast for the BBC Newsnight current affairs programme. MichaelSpringman, the US Consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, during the Father Bushpresidency, told Palast:> In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by high level State Department> officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants. These were, essentially,> people who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country. I> complained bitterly at the time there. I returned to the US, I complained to> the State Department here, to the General Accounting Office, to the Bureau of> Diplomatic Security and to the Inspector General’s office. I was met with> silence. What I was protesting was, in reality, an effort to bring recruits,> rounded up by Osama Bin Laden, to the US for terrorist training by the CIA.> They would then be returned to Afghanistan to fight against the then-Soviets. This may stagger the believers in John Wayne-America, but the force controllingthe US government and the military-intelligence network has been trainingterrorists for decades to ply their trade in target countries across the world.The British establishment do the same, as do Israel and others who claim tooppose terrorism. For sixty years the United States government has operated thenotorious ‘School of the Americas’, which now goes under the Orwellian title ofthe Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. It is based at FortBenning, Georgia, and since 1946 it has trained more than 60,000 soldiers andpolice officers from Central and South America. Its ‘graduates’ have gone on tobe the continent’s most appalling dictators, terrorists, mass killers andtorturers after gleaning their expertise courtesy of the American taxpayer. Itwas School of the Americas ‘graduates’ who ran Guatemala’s D-2 death squad thatdestroyed 448 Mayan villages and killed tens of thousands of people. ‘Forty percent of the cabinet ministers who served the genocidal regimes of Lucas Garcia,Rios Montt and Mejia Victores studied at the School of the Americas’, reportedthe UK Guardian in October 2001. Augusto Pinochet’s secret police and his threeprincipal concentration camps in Chile were run by psychopaths trained at theSchool of the Americas, and the same applies to death squads and dictators inArgentina, Peru, Colombia and elsewhere.The roots of 9/11After the Soviet Union left Afghanistan in 1989 and the remains of the communistAfghan government was removed from the capital Kabul, control of the country wasentirely in the hands of the Mujahideen warlords and the Pakistan ISI. Out ofthis came rule by the Taliban and the emergence of the manufactured terroristgroup given the name, ‘al-Qaeda’, which began to be blamed for striking‘Western’ targets. The BBC documentary series, The Power of Nightmares, producedby Adam Curtis in 2004, said of ‘al-Qaeda’:> The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri had become the focus of a> loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by> the new strategy. But there was no organisation. These were militants who> mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and> assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin> Laden used the term ‘al Qaeda’ to refer to the name of a group until after> September the 11th, when he realised that this was the term the Americans have> given it. Ironically, most Muslims have also accepted the existence of a ‘terror network’called ‘al- Qaeda’, and its role in 9/11, simply because the American governmenthas told them so. It is accepted fact born merely of repeating a lie. You nowhave Muslims claiming to be ‘members of al-Qaeda’ when there is no al-Qaeda inthe way it is portrayed. Such is the power of propaganda. Osama bin Laden and‘al-Qaeda’ are simply Emmanuel Goldstein and the resistance Brotherhood inOrwell’s 1984. They have been created to generate fear in the population thatleads them to accept loss of freedom for their own ‘protection’.In 1999, President Pervez Musharraf seized power in Pakistan in a coup andappointed his ally, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad, as head of the ISI. A yearlater, the ISI gave a house in Pakistan to an alleged funder of the 9/11attacks, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, or Omar Sheikh. This was a man who had beenjailed for kidnapping British and American citizens. The following year, OmarSheikh made many phone calls to ISI chief, Ahmad. Agence France Presse and theTimes of India both quoted an official Indian intelligence report saying thatthe 9/11 attacks were, in part, funded by money wired from Pakistan by the sameOmar Sheikh to ‘lead hijacker’ Mohamed Atta on the order of the ISI’s MahmoudAhmad. One money transfer from the ISI to Atta via Omar Sheikh totalled some$100,000. Of course, there is much more to 9/11 than that, but the connectionsare obvious between the ISI, terrorist groups, the US and British governments,the CIA, British Intelligence, and some of those officially named as complicitin the attacks. America’s sleaze-ball Deputy Secretary of State RichardArmitage, who has close ties to the ISI, visited Pakistan publicly in May 2001,five months before September 11th, while CIA director George Tenet met PresidentMusharraf in an unpublicised meeting later described as ‘unusually long’. ISIDirector Mahmoud Ahmad was in town at the same time. Just two months after thesemeetings, the American organisation, Human Rights Watch, reported that the ISIwas:> ... bankrolling Taliban military operations ... arranging training for its> fighters, planning and directing offensives, providing and facilitating> shipments of ammunition and fuel, and on several occasions apparently directly> providing combat support. Yet, within months of the Human Rights Watch report, and the visit to Pakistanby Tenet and Armitage, the US and Britain would be bombing the Taliban for theiralleged involvement with 9/11 and ‘al-Qaeda’ while, at the same time, thePakistan government and the ISI were being touted as ‘allies’ in the ‘war onterror’! A week before September 11th, ISI chief Mahmoud Ahmad arrived inWashington to meet Armitage and other government and intelligence officials.While the 9/11 attacks were unfolding, he would be having breakfast with Floridasenator, Bob Graham, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, along withPakistan’s Ambassador to the US, Maleeha Lodhi, and other US members of theSenate and House Intelligence Committees, including CIA operative,Representative Porter Goss. It was Graham and Goss who later co-chaired thejoint House-Senate ‘investigation’ into the 9/11 attacks which supported theofficial story. Goss would become head of the CIA after Tenet. The Pakistanjournalist, Amir Mateen, wrote the following on September 10th, 2001:> ISI Chief Lt-Gen. Mahmoud’s week-long presence in Washington has triggered> speculation about the agenda of his mysterious meetings at the Pentagon and> National Security Council. Officially, he is on a routine visit in return to> CIA Director George Tenet’s earlier visit to Islamabad. Official sources> confirm that he met Tenet this week. He also held long parleys with> unspecified officials at the White House and the Pentagon. > But the most important meeting was with Marc Grossman, US Under Secretary of> State for Political Affairs. One can safely guess that the discussions must> have centred around Afghanistan … and Osama bin Laden. What added interest to> his visit is the history of such visits. Last time Ziauddin Butt, Mahmoud’s> predecessor, was here, during Nawaz Sharif’s government, the domestic politics> turned topsy-turvy within days. It would take just one day to transform American and global politics. MahmoudAhmad was replaced as ISI chief when the links were made public between him andOmar Sheikh in the transfer of money to Mohamed Atta; but Pakistan still joinedthe US in the ‘war on terror’ and was rewarded by a major American aid package.In 2006, President Musharraf said the Bush administration had threatened to bombhis country ‘into the Stone Age’ if he did not cooperate. He said the threat wasconveyed by Richard Armitage, the thug and CIA drug-runner, who was number twoto Colin Powell at the State Department. It was arranged for Powell to betravelling on September 11th, leaving Armitage at the helm. ISI operative OmarSheikh would later be given the death sentence for killing the Wall StreetJournal reporter, Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and beheaded in 2002. Pearlwas in Pakistan to investigate the connections between al- Qaeda, the ‘shoebomber’ Richard Reid, Pakistan’s ISI and the $100,000 wired to Mohamed Atta’saccount in the US by Omar Sheikh on the orders of Mahmoud Ahmad. In fact, it ishighly unlikely that Omar Sheikh killed Daniel Pearl. As the former Britishgovernment minister, Michael Meacher, wrote:> Omar Sheikh, a British-born Islamist militant, is waiting to be hanged in> Pakistan for a murder he almost certainly didn’t commit – of the Wall Street> Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002.

To bring them to justice would mean thedanger of exposing the nexus behind 9/11 and the bogus ‘war on terror’,orchestrated by the cult that controls the US and UK governments, and involvingthe Pakistan government and its terrorist wing, the ISI. Whenever we hear thenames Pakistan and ISI, the alarm bells should be deafening.‘Anti-terrorism’ terroristsThe manufactured terrorist attacks since, and including, September 11th 2001,have many common themes. This is as you would expect given that the same forcewas behind them. One theme is the connection between the intelligence agencies‘protecting people’ and the ‘terrorists’ those same agencies blame for killingpeople. This is nothing new in the sick and shady world of the ‘intelligencecommunity’, where often ‘recruitment’ is just another way of saying ‘find us apsychopath’. It has long been publicly established that British ‘Intelligence’(their word, not mine) planted its agents in the Irish terror groups and thenfed them ‘information’ about people in Northern Ireland that they wanted dead.They would say that this or that person was a government informer and the targetwould be killed by the terrorists. In effect, the intelligence hierarchy turnedthe terrorists they were supposed to be targeting into their own assassinationsquad. Martin Ingram (a pseudonym), a former British Army Intelligence Officerand co-author of the book, Stakeknife, has confirmed his involvement in thisoperation and names Martin McGuinness, now a member of the UK parliament, as aBritish agent working under the code, ‘J118’. This is a staggering claim tothose who see the world in terms of distinct ‘sides’, because McGuinnessrepresents Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA terrorist group that wassupposed to be at war with the British government at the time. British IrishRights Watch has presented a confidential report to the authorities on IRAterrorist attacks in Northern Ireland involving at least two ‘security forceagents’. These include ‘human bomb’ attacks in which people drove vehiclescarrying explosives into army checkpoints. Yes, British military checkpoints inattacks engineered by British military intelligence. Alice in Wonderland hadnothing on these guys, but it makes total sense once you have the coordinates ofwhat they are trying to achieve and the methods they use to get there. BritishIrish Rights Watch has highlighted other attacks and murders in which the IRAand British intelligence colluded, among them the murder of lawyer, PatFinucane.Victor Ostrovsky, a former Mossad agent, is another insider who has confirmedthe way the web operates. He points out that Mossad’s motto is ‘By way ofdeception, thou shalt do war’. In his books, including By Way of Deception, hesays that Mossad is expert in ‘false flag’ terrorist attacks which can be blamedon targets they wish to discredit and destroy. Andreas von Buelow, the formerGerman Defence Minister, told me that Abu Nadal, the one-time Arab terrorist‘Mr. Big’, was an asset of Mossad. Ostrovsky reveals that among Mossad’s otheroperations were: provoking the American attack on Libya in 1986 with atransmission that appeared to be broadcasting terrorist orders from Libya to itsembassies around the world, but actually originated in Israel; manipulating warwith Iraq by instigating an enormous propaganda campaign against Saddam Husseinand his ‘weapons of mass destruction’; and training both sides in the Sri Lankancivil war. In May 2007, an ‘al-Qaeda’ video was ‘released’ containing threats ofterrorism against the United States. The message was delivered by ‘Adam YehiyeGadahn’, who turns out to be Adam Pearlman, a Jewish Mossad agent who hadpreviously condemned Muslims as ‘bloodthirsty, barbaric terrorists’. Hisgrandfather was Carl K. Pearlman, a member of the board of directors of theAnti-Defamation League, a Mossad front. Victor Ostrovsky also confirmed thatMossad has a massive network in the United States targeting opponents andpoliticians, and that one of its vehicles is the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL.Its main role is to brand any opposition as ‘anti-Semitic’. These agencies arefiercely compartmentalised so that each person or section only knows so much. Afriend worked at the British intelligence ‘listening station’, or GCHQ inCheltenham, England, where communications traffic from across the world ismonitored. He said that each employee had an electronic card that allowed themto access only those parts of the building where they worked. They could not goanywhere else. Only the few at the top had cards that could take themeverywhere, and this is the way the system operates at every level.Image [../Images/00198.jpg]Figure 189: Mohamed ‘Lee Harvey’ Atta The pork-eating patsyAll this is highly relevant with regard to Mohamed Atta (Figure 189) andcompany, and the attacks of September 11th. He and others were set up to be inthe wrong place at the wrong time thinking they were there to do something else.The official story of Atta falls down at first base. The 9/11 attacks, we aretold, were carried out by Islamic fanatics as part of a Jihad, or Holy War,against the United States. Two of the very basic tenets of the Muslim religionare that you never drink alcohol and never eat the meat of a pig. Atta, it turnsout, was a heavy drinker, regularly snorted cocaine and his favourite food waspork chops. An Islamic fanatic he wasn’t. So why would he be the ‘lead hijacker’in a suicide attack on behalf of an Islamic ‘holy war’? Answer, he wasn’t.Amanda Keller, a stripper and lingerie model (how very Islamic), was Atta’sformer girlfriend and she tells a very different story about this ‘Islamicextremist’ to the one the authorities want us to believe. Keller was trackeddown by journalist Daniel Hopsicker for his book, Welcome to Terrorland: MohamedAtta and the 9-11 Cover-Up in Florida. Daniel has been the vociferousinvestigator of the Florida connection to 9/11, the state governed by thePresident’s brother and Project for the New American Century stalwart, Jeb Bush.Fourteen of the alleged ‘hijackers’ are said to have made Florida their base ofoperation. In particular, the focus was on the two flight schools in Venice,Florida, attended by Atta and eight other ‘9/11 terrorists’. The schools wereHuffman Aviation and the Florida Flight Training Center, both at Venice Airport,a notorious location for drug flights to and from South America. In an amazingcoincidence, well beyond the bounds of my believability, we are told that twoDutchmen, Rudi Dekkers and Arne Kruithof, bought the two schools within monthsof each other purely by chance and that, again purely by chance, Arab would-bepilots began to arrive at both schools in unprecedented numbers. DanielHopsicker calls this the ‘Magic Dutch Boy Theory’. Mohamed Atta attended theDekkers school, Huffman Aviation, after leaving Germany where he was part of anelite international ‘exchange’ programme, a ‘joint venture’ between the US andGerman governments, and run by a little-known private organisation which, saysHopsicker, has close ties to Illuminati figures like David Rockefeller and HenryKissinger.The FBI has systematically covered up the Florida connection. It claimed insteadthat it had no idea where Atta was located between leaving the flying school(according to Dekkers about Christmas 2000) and when they officially pick him upagain in May 2001. This is nonsense, as Hopsicker reveals. Numerous witnessestold them where Atta was in that time – in Venice, Florida. He lived in nearbyNorth Port from January 2001 until early March and then moved in with AmandaKeller in the Sandpiper Apartments. All this was happening four months after theFBI tells us that Atta left Venice and they lost track of him. Rudi Dekkersclaims he never saw Atta again after he left in late 2000 and yet severalwitnesses saw them together in Venice two weeks before 9/11, and another saidAtta bought a sandwich from her in Venice one week before the attacks. Why isthe FBI covering up what happened in Venice and why has Rudi Dekkers not beenheld to account for his false testimony? The answer, says Hopsicker, is thatDekkers was a CIA asset and the CIA was running the whole operation. He said ina radio interview:> I discovered that we were dealing with flight school owners who are CIA assets> … Mohamed Atta was in this country as a result of a program being run through> the Central Intelligence Agency. Hopsicker says the FBI lied to protect Dekkers and, in turn, Dekkers lied toCongress about his relationship with Atta. The 9/11 Commission, set up towhitewash the whole story, basically ignores the flight schools in Venice, alongwith anything that is relevant to the truth. Whenever you are dealing with a CIAconnection you’ll almost always find drug trafficking operations. This is one ofthe main ways that their ‘black ops’ are financed without using official fundsthat can be traced, and people like the Bushes and Clintons are heavily involvedin this, as I shall detail. The joint owner of Huffman Aviation, along withDekkers, was a guy called Wally Hilliard, and on July 25th, 2000, while Atta wasattending the flight school, Hilliard’s Learjet was found to have forty-threepounds of heroin on board when searched by the Drug Enforcement Agency inOrlando. The Orlando Sentinel called it ‘the biggest drug seizure in centralFlorida history’. Hopsicker says it is no coincidence that Atta was, allegedlywith Hilliard’s help, selling Afghanistan opium and heroin that was financingthe Taliban in league with the CIA and Pakistan military intelligence, the ISI.As I said earlier, the CIA and ISI were running the opium/heroin operation inAfghanistan and creaming off profits for Bin Laden and the training and armingof Islamic terrorism. Atta’s girlfriend, Amanda Keller, says he had a constantsupply of cash and drugs:> These guys had money flowing out their ass. They never seemed to run out of> money. They had massive supplies of cocaine. Whenever they’d run out, they’d> go over to the flight school. I followed them one day with Sabrina [a German> friend of Atta’s] to see where they were going, and saw them go into Florida> Flight Training. Dekkers and Hilliard were also flush with money despite losing a fortune on theflying school. One observer said of Dekkers: ‘He didn’t even have the money tobuy gas for an airplane ... and yet a year later he shows up and plops a millionseven, a million eight or two million dollars on the table as if it were papermoney’. Atta was involved in the CIA–ISI drug running operation and it is highlylikely, in fact almost certain, that the $100,000 wired to him by the ISI wasrelated to the drug operation and not money to finance 9/11, as portrayed by theauthorities. Atta was simply set up. Years earlier he is reported to haveenrolled as a student at the International Officers School at Maxwell Air ForceBase in Alabama and witnesses recall him being introduced at an officers’ clubparty. The New York Times reported on September 15th 2001:> Three of the men identified as the hijackers in the attacks on Tuesday have> the same names as alumni of American military schools, the authorities said> today. The men were identified as Mohamed Atta, Abdulaziz al-Omari and Saeed> al-Ghamdi. > The Defense Department said Mr. Atta had gone to the International Officers> School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama; Mr. al-Omari to the Aerospace> Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in Texas; and Mr. al-Ghamdi to the> Defense Language Institute at the Presidio in Monterey, Calif. Atta’s email list included people working for defence contractors like theCanadian firm, Virtual Prototypes, which helped to develop the avionics for theF-15, F-22 and B-2. He was fluent in at least Arabic, English, German, Frenchand Hebrew, and his demeanour and flash clothes led many to believe he wasconnected to the mob. This was no Islamic extremist willing to give his life forthe cause. This was a man who was heard to say in one of his countless drunkenstates: ‘Fuck God’. What we are looking at here is a sting on Atta and others,who were part of the CIA’s drug operation in Florida, to set them up to beblamed for 9/11. They thought they were doing one thing, but they were beingmanipulated to another end. Mohamed Atta was not a nice man to say the veryleast, but on one level he was just another victim, another expendable, in theReptilian hybrid plan for global control. This is why the movements and officialstory of Mohamed Atta make no sense, as I expose in detail in Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster. It is a cover story and they arealways full of holes.More official drivelThe FBI tale is that after arriving in Boston on September 10th, Atta andanother ‘hijacker’, Abdulaziz Alomari, rented a Nissan Altima from the Alamocompany at Boston Logan Airport and drove just over 100 miles to Portland,Maine. They are said to have stayed overnight at a Comfort Inn before headingthe next morning for Portland Airport and a plane back to Boston to pick upFlight 11. In Maine, investigators claim that Atta and Alomari met up with otherhijackers who came into the United States from across the Canadian border. Theseother men are said to have driven back from Maine to Boston Airport while Attaand Alomari flew to Boston the next morning. On September 10th, we are told thatfive Arab men ‘believed’ to be the ‘hijackers’, and including Atta, tried to buyor rent cell phones from a store in Portland, ‘investigators’ say. They wererefused at first, because they did not have the proper identification, but thatall changed when the men paid $3,000 in cash. If they did not have properidentification to buy cell phones, how did Atta manage to hire a car that sameday? How did they manage to buy air tickets, as we are told they now tried todo? You have got to hear this next bit. The men are reported to have used theirnew phones to call the airport at Bangor, Maine, to get a flight to Boston, butthey couldn’t get one with the right times. They then allegedly called thePortland International Jetport where two made reservations – clearly this issupposed to be Atta and Alomari. The other three men are believed, according tosome reports, to have returned to Boston in Atta’s rented Nissan, but police saythey found this car at Portland Airport. If they did, how did these other‘hijackers’ get to Boston Logan to connect with Flights 11 and 175? If theydidn’t use Atta’s rental car, they must have hired another, or gone by plane.Where is the documentation? No one seems to ask these questions.Let’s just take a breath here. ‘Highly trained terrorists’, along with their‘leader’, Mohamed Atta, were planning to hijack four commercial airliners, takeover the controls and direct them to their target, but they wait until the daybefore to book seats on planes to connect with the flights they have plannedmeticulously to hijack? And they only buy cell phones at that time also? What?But hold on, there’s more. Atta and Alomari are said to have been caught onvideo at Portland as they boarded a USAir flight for Boston on that morning ofSeptember 11th. Well, for a start, that wasn’t Alomari on the videotape, becausehe is still alive and still more questions arise here. Why would the leader ofthe biggest plane hijack in history, an attack years in the planning accordingto the FBI, risk flying into Boston that morning and giving himself so littletime between landing in Boston from Portland and taking off on Flight 11 – aflight scheduled to leave at 7.45 am? If the Portland flight had been delayedthe whole operation was scuppered. On the videotape released by the FBI of‘Atta’ and ‘Alomari’ getting on the plane at Portland is the time code 05-53-41(Figure 190). That’s just nineteen seconds short of six minutes to six, but theflight they took from Portland to Boston that morning, USAir Flight 5930, wasscheduled to depart at … 6 am. This is only six minutes after ‘Atta’ and‘Alomari’ were ‘captured’ on videotape passing through security. No wonder theywere described as ‘rushing’ for the plane. The FBI timeline says that Atta andAlomari checked out of their hotel in Portland at 5.33 am, just twenty-sevenminutes before their plane was due to depart, and they had to park their rentalcar, deal with the paperwork, check in and get to the gate. Anyone who travelsby air knows that if you leave it that late you are highly likely to miss theflight. Not only did the leader of the biggest plane hijacking in history takethe chance of flying into Boston from a connecting flight that morning, hearrived so late that the Portland plane left only minutes after he got to thegate. All that planning and he took those risks of not even getting to Boston?It’s a fairy story. The Washington Post talked about the ‘… astonishing degreeof organization and planning undertaken by the terrorists’. Hilarious. I askedthe FBI about all these anomalies and contradictions, but officials refused toanswer my questions.Image [../Images/00199.jpg]Figure 190: The ‘Atta’ security camera footage with two time codes. One wasaccurate, the other added to make the fake version more credible Another thing. Michael Tuohey, the US Airways ticket agent who checked in ‘Atta’and ‘Alomari’, remembers that they were running late when they approached hisdesk wearing suits and ties and Alomari also wore a white shawl. A hundred yardsand minutes later they are said to be pictured passing through security withoutsuits, ties or shawl. ‘They left my workstation in suits and ties. I didn’t seethem take their coats off’, Tuohey recalls. ‘Atta left carrying a small duffelbag and the other had a very small bag. I guess they could have placed thejackets, ties and shawl in Atta’s bag. I just don’t know’. A friend of Tuohey’swho was on the flight to Boston said he recalled the two leaving the plane insuits and ties. Tuohey said that Alomari was ‘happy-go-lucky’ and ‘not likeyou’d expect from someone knowing he is going to die’. There seemed nothingunusual about the pair. Tuohey said that the Atta he checked in spoke perfectEnglish, but the attendant at a Jetport Gas station who had met ‘Atta andAlomari’ the day before said ‘they spoke such poor English that I had to givethem directions to Wal-Mart three times’. He said the ‘Alomari’ in the picturereleased by the FBI could not have been the one he met because he was too tall.Still, no problem, we can sort this out. There was a surveillance camera atMichael Tuohey’s check-in desk that would have caught both men clearly on video.Ahhh, a little problem there (as usual). Tuohey said he was told by the FBI on9/11 that his video camera had been out of order for several weeks and nopictures were available. ‘I had worked there a long time and never knew thecameras were broken until I was told by the agents’, Tuohey said. The FBI knewthat the camera at his desk had not been working for weeks, but no one had toldthe guy working there every day? Again and again cameras are ‘not working’ whentheir pictures would demolish the official story.On the Portland airport security video a second time code appears in the centreof the screen – the last place you would put a time code on a surveillancevideo. This code reads 05.45 and appears to only be there to hide the ridiculouscontradiction of a ‘highly professional’ leader of the hijackers running to hisplane at six minutes to departure. The way the shot is framed by most of themedia, only the second time code in the middle of the screen is included, notthe true one at the bottom of the frame. If this second, centre-of-the-screen,time code was correct, it means that Atta and friend must have checked out oftheir hotel, taken their car to the airport car park, checked in and passedthrough security to the gate all in twelve minutes! I rang Ruth Dudley, a verynice lady, who was Head of Security at Portland Airport on September 11th. Iasked her why there were two time codes – one of them slap bang in the middle ofthe screen. She said she didn’t know and would have to see it to give me anopinion. Unfortunately, she said, they didn’t have those tapes anymore becausethey were confiscated on 9/11 by the FBI. I asked the Bureau why there were twotime codes on the video and why one was in the middle of the screen, butofficials refused to answer. Mohamed Atta, and other ‘hijackers’, were CIAassets involved in drug trafficking and other covert operations, and they werefollowing instructions to be in the wrong place at the wrong time to be framedfor 9/11. This has happened so many times in the sick and disgraceful history ofIlluminati/Intelligence agency manipulation. Lee Harvey Oswald, thefalsely-accused assassin of President Kennedy, was another CIA operative who wasset up to take the rap. There is no evidence that Mohamed Atta boarded Flight11. I am not saying for sure that he didn’t, but no evidence has been presented.He was not on the passenger list released by the airline and he disappearedafter the flight from Portland to Boston. It would have been easy to confirmthat he boarded by showing the footage from security cameras at Boston Logan,but this international airport did not have cameras in its departure lounge. Anessential point in choosing that airport, no doubt.The London bombings and other insider–terrorismWhen you look at other ‘Islamic terrorism’ you find similar connections to theintelligence network. The man accused of supplying the dynamite used in the ‘al-Qaeda’ train bombings in Madrid was in possession of the private telephonenumber of the head of Spain’s Civil Guard bomb squad, the London Times reported.It said ‘the revelation has raised fresh concerns in Madrid about links betweenthose held responsible for the March bombings, which killed 190 people, andSpain’s security services ...’ John Loftus, an American intelligence specialistand former prosecutor for the Justice Department, told US television that thealleged ‘mastermind’ of the London bombings in July 2005 was a double agent forBritish intelligence. Loftus said of Haroon Rashid Aswat:> Back in 1999 he came to America. The Justice Department wanted to indict him> in Seattle because him and his buddy were trying to ... set up a terrorist> training school in Oregon ... We’ve just learned that the headquarters of the> US Justice Department ordered the Seattle prosecutors not to touch Aswat,> apparently Aswat was working for British intelligence ... > ... what’s really embarrassing is that the entire British police are out> chasing him, and one wing of the British government, MI6 or the British Secret> Service, has been hiding him. Nothing new there, then. Those London bombings, which killed more than fiftypeople, involved other ‘coincidences’. At precisely the same time that thebombings were happening on three underground trains and a London bus there was atraining exercise going on in the same area based on the scenario that mirroredwhat actually occurred – same time, same stations. This is a repeat of thetechnique used on 9/11 with the ‘training exercises’ involving planes hijackedover the northeast United States. Peter Power, Managing Director of ‘crisismanagement’ company, Visor Consultants, is a former London Metropolitan Policeofficial and worked at one time with the Anti-Terrorist Branch. He told BBCradio just hours after the London attacks:> At half past nine this morning we were actually running an exercise for a> company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going> off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning, so I> still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing up right now … we planned> this for a company and for obvious reasons I don’t want to reveal their name> but they’re listening and they’ll know it. > And we had a room full of crisis managers for the first time they’d met and so> within five minutes we made a pretty rapid decision that this is the real one> and so we went through the correct drills of activating crisis management> procedures to jump from slow time to quick time thinking and so on. When Power gave his interview, police were saying that the bombs went off over aperiod of around an hour, but later it was confirmed that the tube bombings wentoff simultaneously – exactly the same as the exercise scenario. This staggering‘coincidence’ doesn’t mean that Power and his company had to be ‘in on it’. Weneed to keep thinking compartmentalisation. They only needed to be hired tostage the exercise, not to know what it was really for. Training exercises are agreat cover for such engineered ‘terrorism’. It can confuse the reaction systemand mean that if one of your operatives is picked up with evidence to connectthem to the attacks you can say: ‘No, he’s okay, he was part of the exercise’.It also allows you to hire people to carry fake – or even real – bombs thinkingthey were part of the exercise when all along others are manipulating them intolocations where they can to take the blame. I am not saying this happened forsure with the London bombings, but it does happen, as does the manipulation ofreal terrorists to be blamed for atrocities they did not commit. The officialstory alleges that three British nationals from West Yorkshire, all of Pakistanidescent, and a Jamaican-born British national from Buckinghamshire wereresponsible for the bombings. It was claimed that the three from Yorkshire droveto Luton railway station north of London that morning, where they met the otherand boarded the 7.40 train to London. The problem is that the 7.40 train wascancelled and that is just one of a list of anomalies and questions surroundingthe bombings. The ‘bombers’ left their car in the station car park at Luton andpaid in advance to park there for seven days. They bought return railway ticketsto London. Why would they do that if they were going to kill themselves inlittle more than an hour? We are told that the four split up when they arrivedat London’s Kings Cross station, but they could not have been there in time tocarry out the bombings if they caught a train later than the 7.40. When thisfact began to be publicised, the official story changed and we were told theytook an earlier train, a claim that also does not stand up to scrutiny. Despitethe hundreds of surveillance cameras at the railway stations and throughout theLondon tube network, very few images of the alleged bombers have been released.They include the one claimed to be the four men arriving at Luton station(Figure 191, overleaf), led by ‘bus bomber’ Hasib Hussain, but none of thesurveillance images prove they were involved in the bombings.Three bombs went off on tube trains at 8.50 am and Hasib Hussain is said to haveexploded the fourth fifty-seven minutes later on a number 30 London bus inTavistock Square, appropriately the same name as one of the Illuminati’s majormind-control operations, London’s Tavistock Institute (Figure 192). It isclaimed that Hussain bought some batteries and went to a McDonalds for a burgerbefore boarding the bus. Yeah, that sounds feasible … before I meet Allah I musthave a Big Mac. The No 30 bus was apparently one of only two to be diverted fromits normal route after the train bombings and … here we go again … itssurveillance camera wasn’t working to prove what happened – as with theassassination of Princess Diana, the Portland airport check-in camera, and themurder by police of a Brazilian electrician in a London tube station, shot seventimes in the head after they ‘mistook’ him for a suicide bomber. One seniorpolice official said of the ‘faulty’ bus camera:> It’s a big blow and a disappointment. If the cameras had been running we would> have had pin-sharp close-up pictures of the person who carried out this> atrocity. We don’t know if the driver forgot to switch them on or if there was> a technical problem but there are no images. Image [../Images/00200.jpg]Figure 191: The ‘security camera’ photograph of the four ‘London bombers’arriving at Luton railway station. See ‘Evidence Luton CCTV image is fake’ inthe Coverups archive at davidicke.com [http://davidicke.com] Image [../Images/00201.jpg]Figure 192: The aftermath of the bus bombing in London’s Tavistock Square How convenient, and how often this happens. London bus drivers contacted me tosay they were highly suspicious about the official story and another told aconspiracy website that the CCTV cameras were regularly checked and maintained.Descriptions of the ‘bus bomber’ by a man claiming to be a passenger did notmatch the clothing of Hasib Hussain caught on camera that day. Another callingcard by the symbolism-obsessed Illuminati was the advertisement splashed acrossthe side of the bus for a horror movie called The Descent, which featured abloodied actress, Shauna Macdonald, staring out of darkness. The ad said:‘Outright Terror … Bold and Brilliant’ (Figure 193). As with the hijacker’spassport on 9/11 and Atta’s bag that ‘failed to make Flight 11’, the policecould identify all the London ‘bombers’ almost immediately from their documentsfound at the scene. Nothing was left of their bodies, but their documents, noproblem. Documentation of one ‘bomber’ was found at three of the four bombsites, which is quite a trick. The London Times reported that police had no needof DNA evidence to identify the bombers because they were all carrying personaldocuments. ‘It is as if they wanted their identities to be known’, a policesource told the paper. As BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner put it:> I do think it very strange that they were able to find these documents> belonging to these bombers. Maybe they thought they were going to paradise so> it didn’t really matter but it allowed the police to trace where they came> from very quickly. It was a strange thing to do. Image [../Images/00202.jpg]Figure 193: Calling card on the side of the bus from the symbolism-obsessedReptilian hybrids But it’s not so strange when you understand the game. The bombs were supposed tobe in backpacks carried by the four, and so any explosion would have been fromthe inside outwards. However, this was not the experience of some survivors ofthe tube train bombs who spoke to the media. Bruce Lait, from Cambridge, and hisdance-partner, Crystal Main, were nearest to the blast on their train, but werethe only ones in their carriage to escape serious injury. Lait told theCambridge Evening News:> The policeman said ‘mind that hole, that’s where the bomb was’. The metal was> pushed upwards as if the bomb was underneath the train. They seem to think the> bomb was left in a bag, but I don’t remember anybody being where the bomb was,> or any bag. The Cambridge Evening News said: ‘This suggests at least one of the bombs mayhave been planted either on the track, or on the undercarriage’. Yes they were,but how do ‘suicide bombers’ with backpacks who’d just arrived by train fromLuton put them there? Christophe Chaboud, head of the French Anti-TerrorismCo-ordination Unit, told the Le Monde newspaper that the explosives used in thebombings were of military origin. He said the injuries to the passengersindicated that they had been placed on the ground or perhaps under seats. Tryunder the trains. The London bombings borrowed their script from 9/11 – fakeconfessions, speculation on the fall of sterling before the bombings, and novideo footage released from the stream of cameras that must have caught thebombers over and over in London had the story been true. Clear confirmation ofprior knowledge of the attacks comes with the warning to Israeli FinanceMinister and rabid Neocon, Benjamin Netanyahu. Associated Press reported that hewas told by police to stay at his hotel and not attend an event close to whereone of the blasts would go off that morning. Israeli officials later deniedthis, but hours after the bombings this article by the former head of Mossad,Efraim Halevi, was published in the Jerusalem Post:> The multiple, simultaneous explosions that took place today on the London> transportation system were the work of perpetrators who had an operational> capacity of considerable scope. They have come a long way since the two> attacks of the year 1998 against the American embassies in Nairobi and> Dar-Es-Salaam, and the aircraft actions of September 11, 2001. > There was careful planning, intelligence gathering, and a sophisticated choice> of timing as well as near-perfect execution. We are faced with a deadly and> determined adversary who will stop at nothing and will persevere as long as he> exists as a fighting terrorist force. Image [../Images/00203.jpg]Figure 194: We must protect you from the terrorists by watching you all thetime: Problem-Reaction-Solution Image [../Images/00204.jpg]Figure 195: Nazi German poster circa 1934 with the same theme There is one problem with this, however. He says that they were ‘multiple,simultaneous explosions’ when the London police were saying at the time thatthey happened at intervals over some sixty minutes. It was only days later thatthey announced that the tube bombs were simultaneous. How did Halevi know beforethey did? An Israeli-owned 'security' company, Verint Systems, was responsiblefor the underground CCTV cameras that were 'not working' during the bombings,just as another Israeli-owned company, ICTS, had the contract through asubsidiary for passenger screening at the 9/11 airports. See the Internetdocumentary 7/7 Ripple Effect in the coverups archive at davidicke.com[http://davidicke.com] for detailed analysis of the London bombings. The‘bombers’ were set up and I stress again that often the ultimate power behind‘terror cells’ is the intelligence agencies and the secret society network. Therecruited stooges who think they are serving ‘Allah’ have no idea who theirhidden controllers are. Of course, there are ‘terror groups’, but who reallycontrols them? Also, any ‘Pakistan connection’ the ‘bombers’ were alleged tohave brings us back to the Pakistan ISI, a terrorist wing of the CIA and BritishIntelligence. The British authorities have an appalling record of blaming thewrong people for terrorist outrages by withholding or tampering with evidenceand by forced confessions … the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four, Maguire Seven,on and on it goes. The London bombings have been used to justify more control,surveillance and loss of human rights because, as Tony Blair put it: ‘We know weneed strict controls in a changing world’. London Transport posters thatappeared after the attacks said it all (Figures 194 and 195) and so does artistDavid Dees (Figure 196).All these themes are a constant in the bogus ‘war on terror’. Those who wish tojustify the Orwellian global state need the ‘problem’ of Islamic terrorism sothey can offer the ‘solution’. We have already heard so many lies and been soldso many ‘terror plots’ that turned out not to be so; but they still implant therepetition of ‘danger from terrorists’ into the public conscious andsubconscious mind. In the wake of this, the law ‘enforcement’ authorities havebecome a law unto themselves. We have had an innocent Brazilian electrician shotseven times in the head while held down by London police, and no one has beencharged with his murder; we have had a ‘terrorist’ shot by police in ForestGate, London, when they raided his home on an ‘intelligence tip off’ that turnedout to be false; we have had the ‘terrorists’ planning to use the deadly poison,Ricin, except that they weren’t; and there was the ‘plot’ to ‘attack’ a Britishfootball stadium which, it turned out, was never planned at all. Seven peoplewere arrested in Florida for an alleged plan to blow up the Sears Tower inChicago on such non-existent evidence that they were dubbed ‘seven dipshits in awarehouse’ by John Stewart on the Comedy Channel’s The Daily Show. AttorneyGeneral Alberto ‘Seedy’ Gonzales had to admit at a news conference that theseven had no links with ‘al-Qaeda’ members, no weapons and no explosives. We hadthe ‘terror plot’ to bomb transatlantic flights that was ‘foiled’ by the‘intervention’ of Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, or ISI, which hastrained, armed and funded terrorists on a massive scale. The ISI was at theheart of the conspiracy, with US, British and Israeli military intelligence, toattack the United States on September 11th 2001.Image [../Images/00205.jpg]Figure 196: Who benefits from 9/11, the London bombings and other terroristattacks? We can expect many more lies about ‘plots’ and ‘threats’, and no doubt therewill be other terrorist outrages engineered by the very people who use them tointroduce still more controls and surveillance. Problem-Reaction-Solution isindeed a most powerful weapon for mass deception, but it can only work with acompliant mainstream media that repeats the official story without question orinvestigation. Unfortunately, with a few honourable exceptions, that is what wehave."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 17 The ‘no conspiracy’ alliance > The media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the> innocent guilty and the guilty innocent, and that’s power because they control> the minds of the masses. > Malcolm X The desperation to suppress the truth about September 11th and other engineeredevents, as well as the conspiracy in general, has brought together some strangebedfellows indeed. They include most of establishment academia, the politicaland journalistic ‘left’ and ‘Greens’, and the political and journalistic‘right’. No, make that ‘far-right’. These apparently ‘opposing’ groups have cometogether in mutual service to the system and their own world-view programming.Fundamental to any tyranny is control of information and today’s global tyrannyhas all but achieved that. The mainstream media is owned by the corporations whoensure that what people are told in the daily ‘news’ leads them to see the worldin a way that suits the corporations and the shadowy bloodline networks thatcontrol them. This is why the only investigation into the official version of9/11 has come from researchers and real journalists working outside thecorporate-controlled mainstream. Reptilian hybrid corporations like GeneralElectric, AOL Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, Viacom and Bertelsmann ownenormous tracts of the global media and, with mergers and takeovers continuing,that control is falling into ever-fewer hands. This is encouraged by Reptilianhybrid governments which are relaxing restrictions on media monopolies. This isoften done by trading political support in return for changes in the law, atechnique used to great effect by moguls like Rupert Murdoch. This is a viciouscircle, because the more of the media the corporations can own, the moresignificant their political support becomes, and so the greater the influenceover governments. To be fair, even genuine journalists find it almost impossibleto tell the truth while operating within the imposed bias and restriction onwhat can be reported, and these are now being sifted out and removed, anyway.The policy is to employ only those who will not challenge the system. Thecorporate media masters want the stupid and ignorant and those to whom careerand ‘fame’ are more important than telling the truth.The ‘news’ fixersWe are led to believe that there is a right wing and left wing media, as thereis supposed to be a right wing and left wing in politics, but these are merelydifferent expressions of the same system worship, as I shall now explore. Themost blatant example of ‘right wing’ media manipulation is Fox News, thepropaganda ministry owned by Rupert Murdoch and his vast media empire thatincludes Sky TV, Asian Star Television, the New York Post and the Britishnewspapers, the Sun and the Times. Murdoch also bought MySpace.com[http://MySpace.com] in 2005 and given that line up – and so much more – it issobering to see what goes on behind the scenes in the Murdoch fiefdom to dictateand manipulate what passes for ‘news’. I will use Fox News to explain howsystematic is the suppression of information, but the ‘left wing’ media operatesin the same way and both attack anyone who suggests that 9/11 was an inside job,or that there is an Orwellian conspiracy (Figure 197). For those who are new tohow the media works, it is worth remembering that these are the people thatstand between what is happening in the world and what the public are told ishappening. People say that if there was really a conspiracy the media would tellthem about it, but what you are about to read will explain why they don’t. Most‘journalists’ are ignorant of who is really controlling events. To them,investigative journalism is reading the morning papers and watching the newsroomtelevision. Even if they did know, they would not be allowed to report theirinformation by the Reptilian hybrid corporations that control the mainstreampresses and airwaves. In this climate of suppression, any genuine mainstreaminvestigation of 9/11 has never stood a chance.Image [../Images/00206.jpg]Figure 197: A typical ‘Fix’ News viewer Image [../Images/00207.jpg]Figure 198: Fox News brain-washes whiter Fox News, or more accurately Fix News, is the most biased television station Ihave seen, certainly in North America and Europe, and yet its slogan is ‘Fairand Balanced’ (Figure 198). This is Orwellian Newspeak akin to the Ministry ofTruth in 1984 where history and information were falsified. Outside the Ministrywas the notice: ‘War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength.’That’s the same as saying Fox News is ‘fair and balanced’. To Fox News, anyonequestioning the official version of September 11th is a ‘nut’ who should besilenced. They have been particularly vitriolic about people like actor CharlieSheen and talk show host Rosie O’Donnell after they said they didn’t believewhat we have been told about the attacks. Fox News presenters are employed totake a slant on the day’s stories decreed by producers who answer to Murdoch andhis henchmen. Watching souls being sold for the Murdoch shilling would make anyproper journalist puke, and it’s not even necessary to watch for long to see howstunningly unfair and unbalanced it really is. Switch on any time and there itis, 24/7. King of the Claptrap is a guy called Bill O’Reilly on The O’ReillyFactor, who settled a sexual harassment suit out of court in 2004 brought by hisformer producer, Andrea Mackris. The suit claimed that O’Reilly talked toMackris about sexual fantasies, masturbation and vibrators while ‘sometimesseeming to pleasure himself’. Facts and O’Reilly, as with Fox News in general,are not close friends. Peter Hart, Media Analyst for Fairness and Accuracy inReporting, said:> The O’Reilly Factor is probably the perfect example of everything that’s wrong> with Fox News channel. They have stories that are selected primarily to upset> liberals and Democrats and prop up the Republican Party. You have a hostility> towards guests that disagree with the host and you have a host who in service> of his conservative politics will distort facts, will misrepresent things, and> will in some cases, just fabricate. I saw one example of this when O’Reilly harangued and misrepresented SunsaraTaylor of the anti-war organisation, The World Can’t Wait. She pointed out thatBush attorney John Yoo, who co-authored the freedom-busting Patriot Act, hadsaid in a debate in Chicago that there was no law to stop the President orderingtorture, including by ‘crushing the testicles of the person’s child’. O’Reillyaccused her of slander and being unpatriotic. He called her ‘hysterical’ and‘simply a woman who doesn’t know what she’s talking about’. The guy’s a nastypiece of work, a playground bully, and so how Murdoch must love him. They saylikes attract. O’Reilly’s treatment of Jeremy Glick, the son of a Port Authorityworker who died on 9/11, was even more disgraceful. Glick’s ‘crime’ was to signan anti-war petition and, while the ‘interview’ itself was appalling, whathappened afterwards gave an insight into the mentality that Murdoch employs.O’Reilly said to Glick words to the effect of ‘Get out of my studio before Ifucking tear you to pieces’. Glick went to a room to get a cup of coffee and hesaid that ‘the executive producer and the assistant encouraged me to leave thebuilding because they were concerned that if O’Reilly ran into me in the hallwaythat he would end up in jail’. On another occasion when a caller named ‘Mike’simply mentioned a rival show hosted by the superb Keith Olbermann on MSNBC,O’Reilly had him cut off and said: ‘… if you’re listening, Mike, we have yourphone number, and we’re going to turn it over to Fox security, and you’ll begetting a little visit …’ A documentary called Outfoxed, Rupert Murdoch’s War onJournalism (www.outfoxed.org [http://www.outfoxed.org]) interviewed former FoxNews employees and other media commentators and revealed the systematic bias andmanipulation of information presented as ‘news’. Frank O’Donnell, a former FoxNews reporter, said that Murdoch began to blatantly dictate the content:> We received an order from one of Murdoch’s apparachniks … that we should cut> away from our newscast and start carrying a fawning tribute to Ronald Reagan> that was airing at the Republican Party Convention. We were stunned because up> until that point we were allowed to do legitimate news and suddenly we were> ordered from the top to carry propaganda, to carry Republican right wing> propaganda. O’Donnell said that they were told to run a long uncut report essentiallyattacking Ted Kennedy, a long-time opponent of Murdoch. ‘It had zero newsvalue’, he said. ‘We were told, “You have to run this thing uncut”. You couldnot even edit it down and just run a snippet of it.’ Jon Du Pre, former Fox Newspresenter with the West Coast Bureau, said the stated practice was also toembarrass, humiliate, challenge or disrupt whatever black Democrat, JesseJackson, did:> We were told on many occasions that he was one of our targets. Anything we> could do or say that would embarrass him, discredit him, we were encouraged to> find the information and we were encouraged to report the information. Fox News executives issue a ‘message of the day’ and other orders to staff whichformer Fox contributor and CIA intelligence analyst, Larry Johnson, described as‘a detailed list of subjects to talk about and not talk about’. He said they‘were actually issuing edicts to the reporters to control what they could sayand how they could say it’. Presenter Jon Du Pre said a memo would arrive everymorning from headquarters saying ‘we want to touch on the following issues, wewant to cover the following stories, we want to do them in this particular way’.Du Pre was even suspended for not being enthusiastic enough in his all-dayreporting on the birthday of Ronald Reagan. In response to angry Fox Newsexecutives, he reported that Reagan admirers had ‘been streaming in from allover the country and even parts of Canada and Mexico …’ It wasn’t true, but hewas watching his back and his job. Fox News uses fear to manipulate its viewersthrough sensationalised ‘reporting’ and to control its own staff.Contributor Larry Johnson told how correspondents and those who book guests arefrightened of stepping out of line because it is like they are ‘being monitoredby a Stalinist system, afraid to be seen talking to the wrong person or havingthe wrong kind of email exchange’. Former Fox producer, Frank O’Donnell, said itwas made very clear that they were being monitored and if someone wasn’twatching what they did live, they were at least recording it for review. The‘expert’ guests are booked for their political views and they are dominated bythe Neocons that have controlled the Bush administration and orchestrated thepost 9/11 invasions. A regular contributor is William Kristol, founder of theNeocon’s Project for the New American Century and editor of Murdoch’s Neoconrag, The Weekly Standard. Former Fox News producer, Clara Frenk, said she saw alist of contributors and all the ‘Conservatives’ were well known and ‘very, verystrong people’, while the ‘Liberal’ representatives listed only one person shehad heard of. She said that a lot of the time they used ‘faux-liberals’, someonewho essentially agreed with the right-wing guest – ‘or they would just bring onpeople who were very weak, you know, people who were not well-known’. SteveRendall, Senior Analyst at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, said they studiedFox News one-to-one interviews for twenty-five weeks in 2003 after the Iraqinvasion:> Republicans appeared five times as often as Democrats on one-on-one newsmakers> interviews. That means that Republicans made up 83 per cent of the partisan> guests while Democrats made up just 17 per cent. In addition, the few> Democrats that were interviewed for the show tended to be centrists and> conservative Democrats often brought on to affirm Bush Administration> policies. > … if Fox were the bastion of fairness and balance that it claims to be we’d> see a lot more balance in this prominent interview segment on the network’s> most prestigious show. Instead the numbers indicate that Brit Hume and Special> Report choose their guests based on political considerations rather than news> judgment. Contributor Larry Johnson was dropped after he gave the wrong answer to aquestion from presenter Sean Hannity in the run up to the invasion of Iraq. Hewas asked if the Bush government could fight two wars at the same time and hesaid a war with Iraq would divert resources needed elsewhere:> And Sean Hannity, being the right-wing cheerleader that he is, was just, you> know, incensed that I … had the temerity to suggest that we couldn’t. Facts> don’t seem to have any effect upon him. What was unusual is it was after that> appearance that, even though I was under contract to Fox for another eight> weeks roughly, they stopped using me. There was actually nothing unusual about that. Johnson didn’t repeat theMurdoch/Illuminati line, so he had to go. That’s the Fox News mode of operation.It screamed its support for the Iraq war, while its executives and presentersnever went near so much as a popgun, and anyone who challenged the invasion waseither ignored or brought on for a ritual demolition. The Fox technique for thisis not to employ facts and rational argument, but to shout people down and hurlabuse. Telling people to ‘shut up’ is the way these intellectual giants respondto facts they cannot counter. Fox News targets anyone who could expose the liesand deceit of the system, as Bush’s counter-terrorism advisor Richard Clarkefound out. Clarke’s book, Against All Enemies, criticised the Bushadministration for its actions before 9/11 and for the decision to invade Iraq.It also contradicted the official stories of people like Defense SecretaryDonald Rumsfeld and acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myersabout what they were doing on the morning of September 11th. Jeff Cohen, aformer Fox News contributor, said:> When Richard Clarke emerged it was obvious this was a danger to the> Administration because he had worked at the highest echelons of the Bush> Administration and it was almost like Fox News was working off the playbook> coming out of the White House – that he had to be torn down, that he had to be> turned into a Democrat, a Liberal, a Kerry-guy. The Bush White House and Fox News have the same theme in their ‘messages of theday’ because they are working together. On the night of Boy Bush’s riggedelection ‘victory’ in 2000, the first one to announce that he had been electedpresident was John Ellis, the man in charge of Fox News’ ‘election analysis’division. Ellis is a first cousin of George W. Bush. He made his announcementwhen the data from Florida clearly made the vote too close to call, but,instead, this Bush cousin announced a clear Bush victory. It prompted ABC, NBCand CBS to follow suit. John Nichols, Washington correspondent of The Nation andauthor of the Cheney book, Dick: The Man Who Is President, said:> When Fox made the call that Bush had won and the other networks followed on,> that created the perception that Bush was the winner, when in fact he wasn’t.> But that perception was what really held for the next 37 days and I would> suggest to you that call on election night had more to do with making George> Bush president than any recount or ballot design issue. Once Bush was not elected, but still entered the White House, the manipulationat Fox continued. Former Fox News freelance writer, Dave Korb, told how theywere ordered to slant the coverage in Iraq while American troops and Iraqis weredying by the day.> The Senior Producer told the two or three writers for her news hour: ‘Now just> keep in mind, it’s all good. This is such a fair and balanced issue. Don’t> write about the number of dead or troops being under fire or under attack. Not> that somebody might have died, you know, keep it positive. We’ve got to> emphasise all the good that we’re doing’. She, at that point, made a reference> to rebuilding schools, bringing democracy to Iraq, and then she said, ‘See big> progress. Yoo hoo for us’. Fox News reporters, like others throughout the media, know that they can’t crossa certain line and, if they do, they will either not get their report on air, orthey will face the wrath of their bosses. Self-censorship is in many ways theworse type of news bias, because it doesn’t even get as far as an editor’sspike. There is not even a discussion about the validity of content; the storyis simply never brought to the table. As a former Fox News reporter, whoremained anonymous for career reasons, said:> When you have this Executive Vice-president and those around him, who are> consistently saying, ‘no we’re not gonna do that story, no this story’s bad,> this story’s good’, and it becomes very clear to all the Bureau Chiefs, to> everybody involved who have been there over a period of years, there are> certain kinds of stories, it’s not even worth bringing up, there are other> kinds of stories that you know management’s gonna love. One American editor is reported to have called journalists ‘intellectualprostitutes’ and there is no better example than Fox News where Murdoch’s penisis an object of worship. However, they are not alone and with corporate controlof the global media now almost complete the old saying that you should neverbelieve what you read in the newspapers has never been more accurate. It appliesto all of the media because what we are given as ‘news’ is just a biased versionof events, either through what has been included or left out. It is blatant inmost national newspapers around the world, while at organisations like the BBC,it is more subtle and self-censorship abounds. None of what has followed 9/11would have been possible if we had a news media that was more than just thepublic relations office for the official version of events. Their lack ofinvestigation into the London bombings and 9/11 is a disgrace to theirprofession, and even more so is their ridicule and condemnation of thoseresearchers outside the mainstream who are doing what they should be doing. Intheir dismissal of any suggestion of a conspiracy, the ‘right wing’ and ‘leftwing’ media are at one (Figure 199).Image [../Images/00208.jpg]Figure 199: The mind-control machine The ‘no conspiracy’ software programIn 2007, we had a 9/11 ‘documentary’ in the BBC Conspiracy Files series thatclaimed to investigate the evidence presented by those questioning the officialstory. The programme has rightly been called ‘biased’ and a ‘hit piece’, butmore than anything it was pathetic and classic BBC – indeed the media ingeneral. I worked at the BBC for twelve years, mainly through the entire 1980s,in current affairs, news and sport. The 9/11 ‘documentary’ was bound to emergefrom a Corporation dominated by what I call the ‘Robot Radicals’ of the‘centre-left’. This has two distinct ‘wings’, the ‘intellectuals’ with theirposh voices (private school/elite university), and those ‘from the street’(state school/normally non-elite university or none at all). Both groups sit inthe strings section of the orchestra conducted by the system. It is the‘intellectual’ wing that invariably ends up in the positions of power, becausethey have been to the ‘good’ schools and colleges within the indoctrinationmachine. This is a major source of BBC news and current affairs producers,reporters and presenters, who often come from private schools and universitieslike Oxford and Cambridge – the ‘Oxbridge Set’, with Oxford the dominantpartner. These are the two oldest universities in the English-speaking world andthey have been turning out system servers and leaders for centuries. Oxford issaid to go back to at least the 12th century and Cambridge to the 13th. Theseare the prime Illuminati centres of learning and indoctrination on the planet,especially Oxford.The current BBC Director General, Mark Thompson, went to the elite Jesuitcollege called Stonyhurst in Lancashire and then on to Oxford University.Another recent ‘DG’, as they call them, was John, now ‘Baron’ Birt, who waseducated at the private Roman Catholic St Mary’s College in Liverpool and OxfordUniversity. Squeezed between them was Greg Dyke who did not go to private schooland attended the University of York. He was sacked when Tony Blair’s rigged‘Hutton Inquiry’ condemned the BBC for revealing the truth about Blair ‘sexingup’ claims about the threat from Iraq. Dyke was not a typical BBC man, but evenhe came from the perspective of the cosy left-of-centre and made donations toBlair’s Labour Party before realising that he was funding a monster. That’s thedominating force in the BBC – the ‘intellectual’ wing of the Robot Radicals –who mostly speak in the same slightly posh ‘Oxbridge accent’ (like Oxfordgraduate and actor Hugh Grant) and see the world through the same myopia. I amnot criticising the accent, just the prevalence of it within the BBC whichbetrays the common background. By the time they arrive at the BBC, they arealready largely programmed by the system to see the system the way that suitsthe system.The global media mogul Rupert Murdoch went to Oxford University and MichaelGrade, the head of the ITV network in the UK and former chairman of the BBC,attended the elite Stowe School, which also produced Virgin boss RichardBranson, and the London private school, St Dunstan’s College. The state schoolsystem is there to indoctrinate the masses and the private school system isthere to indoctrinate those who will be the ‘leaders’ and ‘guiders’ of themasses in various fields. Private schools program the offspring of ‘goodfamilies’ to be the leaders while the state schools program the rest to followthem. It is the left wing of the Oxbridge Set that largely ends up insignificant positions at the BBC. Robin Aitken, who spent twenty-five years as aBBC journalist, has written a book called Taking Sides: Bias at the BBC in whichhe says there is a centre-left consensus that undermines its impartiality.Elsewhere, as with Murdoch’s appalling Fox News, there is a right wing consensusand the crucial point is not bias towards left or right, but bias towards thesystem supported by both left and right. The private school–Oxbridge machineimplants a view of life and the system – of ‘how things are’– that programs theperception of virtually all its victims. There are exceptions, but comparativelyfew in my experience and if you come through this programming with your uniqueperspective still intact you must have a serious indoctrination filter.The way the mainstream media views any suggestion of a conspiracy is preciselythe same as you find in mainstream politics, especially, I find, with those whocall themselves ‘green’ or of the ‘left’. The private school–Oxbridgeindoctrination machine turns out its mind-fodder with their ‘left wing’ and‘right wing’ views, and some go into politics in the ‘left-wing’ (I love it)Labour Party, while others join the ‘right wing’ Conservative Party. Long-timeLabour leader, Tony Blair, went to the private Fettes College in Edinburgh andOxford University. The leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, went tothe elite private school at Eton (which has produced nineteen British primeministers) before moving on to Oxford University. Oxford has producedtwenty-five British prime ministers, twenty-eight foreign presidents and primeministers, eighty-six archbishops, eighteen cardinals and even a pope. Seven ofthe eleven British prime ministers up to Tony Blair have been Oxford graduates.The Scottish version of Oxford is Edinburgh University that goes back to the16th century. Tony Blair’s successor, Gordon Brown, is one of its productions.The United States has its own version with the private school-Ivy Leagueuniversity network that produces most of the major political figures, includingBoy and Father Bush and the Clintons, who all went to Yale. Bill Clinton evenwent to Oxford University through an Illuminati ‘Rhodes Scholarship’, and whynot when Oxford offers the best indoctrination in the world? Oxford andCambridge provided the blueprint for the Ivy League. The media is dominated inthe same way by the private school–Oxbridge cabal and so you have the leadingpoliticians and political ‘thinkers’ trained by the same mind-machine as thosewho run the media.The system worshippersIt doesn’t matter if they take on views of the ‘left’ or ‘right’ they are stillserving the same master. They may want to tinker with the system here and thereto suit their only slightly different perspectives, but they never talk ofdismantling the system and transforming the mentality that holds it together.The state schools do the same with their designer-programming aimed at the‘lower classes’. They, too, turn out ‘left’ and ‘right’ believers who haveworship of the system in common. They are like Catholics and Protestants whoworship the same deity, the same ‘God’, in a slightly different way usingslightly different rituals. Just as Catholics and Protestants argue over how toworship the same God, so ‘left and ‘right’ argue over how to worship the samesystem. And here’s the key: both jump on anyone who genuinely challenges thesystem itself like those exposing the truth about 9/11. A Catholic andProtestant may be having an argument over Christianity, but as soon as a Jew orMuslim starts challenging Christianity itself, the Catholic and Protestant willimmediately forget their disagreements and join forces to defend it. That iswhat happens with ‘left’ and ‘right’ when an outsider seeks to expose the systemon which they both rely for their sense of who they are. A ‘left-winger’ willcall for the rich to be taxed even more while a ‘right-winger’ will say theyshould be taxed less. What they are both agreed upon is the income taxation ofthe people when, if the system was operated efficiently and fairly, there wouldbe no need for a tax on income – at least most of which goes straight to thebanks anyway. Taxation is a foundation of the system, so it is never questioned.‘Left’ and ‘right’ may argue over whether interest rates should go up or down,but both agree that interest should be charged on fresh air, figures-on-a-screen‘money’. Interest on money is a foundation of the system, so it is neverquestioned. The list of examples is endless. They disagree about the detail ofhow the system works, but not the system itself.‘Left’ and ‘right’ may argue over the rights and wrongs of Bush, but neitherwill contemplate that 9/11 could have been orchestrated through anadministration that lied about weapons of mass destruction and has caused thedeaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan civilians. For either ‘wing’to accept that 9/11 was an inside job engineered to justify the Orwellian state,is to accept that the indoctrinated view of the world that was daily implantedin their schools and universities (and by their parents) is fundamentallyflawed. A superb example of what I am talking about is a guy called GeorgeMonbiot, a raving Robot Radical ‘journalist’ and ‘activist’ on the Robot Radicalbible of the ‘intellectual left’, the London Guardian. This is the paper thatthreatens to make navel contemplating an Olympic sport. The Guardian editor isAlan Rusbridger who was indoctrinated at the private Cranleigh School andCambridge University. His ‘star’ columnist, George Monbiot, was programmed atthe private Stowe School (see Michael Grade and Richard Branson) and OxfordUniversity, before, oh so appropriately, joining the BBC. Monbiot has become asort of British version of the American, Noam Chomsky, the demigod of the‘intellectual’ left and a product of the Ivy League universities of Pennsylvaniaand Harvard. Chomsky and Monbiot have many things in common, including thedismissal of any idea that the official story of September 11th might not betrue. This was one of Monbiot’s considered and thoughtful responses to the 9/11truth movement:> Why do I bother with these morons? Because they are destroying the movements> some of us have spent a long time trying to build. Those of us who believe> that the crucial global issues ... are insufficiently debated in parliament or> congress, that corporate power stands too heavily on democracy, that war> criminals, cheats and liars are not being held to account, have invested our> efforts in movements outside the mainstream political process. These, we are> now discovering, are peculiarly susceptible to this epidemic of gibberish. How ironic that on his own website Monbiot uses this quote: ‘Tell peoplesomething they know already and they will thank you for it. Tell them somethingnew and they will hate you for it’. What has rattled his cage is that people arestarting to listen to those questioning 9/11 and less to his concrete-mindedview of the world delivered courtesy of Stowe School and Oxford University. Whatmost scrambles the perceptions of such people is that they are taught to seeeverything in terms of ‘sides’, ‘us and them’, ‘left and right’, and this is thementality that dominates the media and stops them seeing that the apparent‘sides’ are controlled by the same force. This is also true of most people whogo through the state school system, but the private-school–Oxbridge–Ivy League‘alumni’ are the ones who occupy the positions of most power and influence.People like Monbiot complain about the power of the corporations over‘democracy’, but his programming prevents him seeing that these corporations arebeing coordinated in their actions to a common goal. There have to be political‘sides’ for the Monbiot mentality or it loses its sense of identity. He saysthat to believe 9/11 was an inside job you must believe that ‘Bush, Cheney,Rumsfeld and their pals are all-knowing, all-seeing and all-powerful ...’ Suchnonsense is confirmation that, like his fellow system-believers, he can’t seethe forest for the twigs. Those who understand how the game is played do not saythat Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld engineered 9/11 – Bush for one is an idiot. Theywere merely the public face through which it was orchestrated. They were pawns,in Cheney’s case a knight, who were moved around the board by the Hidden Hand.Monbiot says of those who challenge 9/11:> The obvious corollary to the belief that the Bush administration is> all-powerful is that the rest of us are completely powerless. In fact it seems> to me that the purpose of the ‘9/11 truth movement’ is to be powerless. The> omnipotence of the Bush regime is the coward’s fantasy, an excuse for inaction> used by those who don’t have the stomach to engage in real political fights. Oh yes, we must have ‘real political fights’ so the Hidden Hand can impose itsOrwellian state through ‘left’ and ‘right’ while the advocates of both tear intoeach other. Grow up, George, or your intellectual blindness will be a lifesentence – and not only for you. Noam Chomsky rightly said (and Monbiot shouldtake note): ‘The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictlylimit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate withinthat spectrum’. That is how the system works and never more obviously than atplaces like Oxford, Cambridge and the Ivy League universities. Chomsky also saidthat if we don’t believe in freedom for people we despise, we don’t believe init at all. Quite right again. But, when it comes to 9/11, Noam will not roam.Chomsky says about government involvement in the September 11th attacks: ‘That’san Internet theory and it’s hopelessly implausible. Hopelessly implausible. Sohopelessly implausible I don’t see any point in talking about it’. The idea thata hidden force could be manipulating world events through different ‘sides’ tothe same end, or that governments could attack their own people, is just toomuch for their minds to handle, so attached are they to their world viewprogramming. Instead, they go into denial and, in Monbiot’s case, viciouslyattack those who are trying to expose the truth about 9/11 that will bring downthe whole ‘us and them’ belief system that he had been indoctrinated to pedal.Attack the messenger if you don’t like the message.It is because of this system-serving mindset of both ‘left’ and ‘right’, thatthe apparently bizarre alliance has emerged between the Robot Radicals,including the leadership of the Greens, and the right-wing governments and mediathey claim to despise. They are all agreed that there is no Orwellian conspiracymanipulating through all ‘sides’ and the official story of 9/11 is what reallyhappened. To the doublethinkers of the Robot Radicals, Bush is a liar abouteverything except what happened on September 11th, because protecting theirworld view is far more important to them than the truth. They aresystem-servers, the lot of them. When a motion was put before a UK Green Partyconference in 2007 calling for an investigation into 9/11, an amendment wasproposed that said:> The Green Party does not, however, believe that there is evidence that any> organisation other than Al Qaida was responsible for the attacks. Nor will it> support or associate with fringe elements that espouse ‘conspiracy theories’> that attempt to suggest that the events of 9 September 2001 in New York were> devised and perpetrated in secret by US security forces, finding these> suggestions in poor taste. Rather, it supports the need for an inquiry into> both the handling of intelligence prior to the terrorist attacks, and the> political response, with its devastating long term effects on international> security. No words suffice and note the ‘9 September’. The Green Party has made itselfirrelevant by joining the very club it pledged to challenge. These ‘Greens’ saythey don’t believe there is any evidence that anyone but ‘al-Qaeda’ wasresponsible for 9/11 when they haven’t even bothered to look, and the only‘evidence’ that it was responsible has come from the Bush administration thatthe Greens condemn, not least for lying! You couldn’t make it up. Given that theBBC is controlled by advocates of the ‘intellectual’ left, which also infeststhe Greens, how could there be any other outcome to a BBC ‘documentary’ about9/11 than having the system’s view presented with most prominence andcredibility? The BBC Conspiracy Files programme betrayed the sloppiest ofunresearched, superficial ‘journalism’ that misrepresented so much of what thosewho challenge the official story are saying. In the final minutes, havingdismissed government involvement, it suggested that any conspiracy was really inthe way that government ‘mistakes’ were covered up by the Bush administration. Ihad to smile. This is what the intellectual ‘left’ has been saying in the formof the Democrats (the ‘left’ to Robot Radicals, bless ‘em). So, the circle couldbe squared, while the belief system of the ‘intellectual’ left survived. It wasthe work of a bunch of Arab pilots who couldn’t fly, but there was a cover up ofmistakes by those terrible people in the ‘right-wing’ Bush administration.Drinks all round. It is no accident that this conclusion was the same as that UKGreen Party amendment, because the same programmed mentality was behind both. Itwas never going to be any other way. For the BBC to have presented a trueinvestigation into the official story and found it to be a Big Lie, would havebeen to change an entire world view of ‘left’ and ‘right’ and political ‘sides’.It would also have revealed an agenda to manipulate into place a global fascistdictatorship and all belief systems would have to concede their power to a blanksheet of paper, as people took a whole new look at the world they thought theylived in. The BBC is going to do that? Not a chance. I listened to a radiointerview with the programme’s producer, and as soon as he began to speak Istarted to chuckle. He was like a tape recording of so many BBC producers I havemet and worked with over the years in news and current affairs on programmeslike the BBC’s Newsnight, now presented by Jeremy Paxman (private MalvernCollege and Cambridge University). The producer was uninformed, unresearched andspoke with the omnipotent ‘Hugh Grant’ voice of someone with a ‘propereducation’. The man will surely go far.Concrete on their mindsWhat you find in politics and the media, you find with most academics who havealso qualified for their places of educational influence by going through thesame mind-machine. I was asked to appear in a television documentary forBritain’s Channel 4 that asked the question: ‘Who is ruling the world?’ Theprogramme was made for young people by the channel’s education department to bebroadcast to schools and colleges. The decision to make the documentary cameafter a survey found that large numbers of young people now mistrust government,authority in general and even Channel 4. What great news this is, given thatthose in power have constantly shown that they lie to us on a daily basis. Mypart in the programme led me to meet a psychology academic called Chris Frenchfrom Goldsmith’s College at the University of London. He’s a BA PhD CPsycholFBPsS FRSA. Must be intelligent then. French had produced some astonishingresearch. Mind, I use the term ‘astonishing’, as in ‘astonishing that hebothered’. He and his colleagues questioned people about ‘conspiracy theories’and this is what they found:> •Those who trust authority are less likely to believe in conspiracies.> •Those who distrust authority are more likely to believe in conspiracies.Ain’t academia great? How would we survive without these guys? Anyone with abrain could have told them that before they even started. If you don’t trustauthority you are going to be more open to claims that they are lying than ifyou think authority is benign and only there to serve the best interests of thepeople. Er, and? As I said to French in our interchange on the programme, thepoint is not who will, or will not, believe in the conspiracy view of worldevents. The question is this: are the conspiracy claims true and supportable bythe evidence? In short, is the conspiracy happening or isn’t it? This, however,is too simple and direct for the concrete end of academia which, in myexperience, is a very long end indeed. Never mind the evidence, it must besomething in people’s psyche that gets them to believe in conspiracies. Afterall, the conspiracies can’t be true, because we don’t believe them. So, let’shave a survey and disappear up our own backsides poring over the obvious, andlet’s forget little irrelevant details like whether the conspiracy is happeningor not.Chris French told me the survey had found that those who believed in ‘conspiracytheories’ were more likely to be ‘delusional’ than those who didn’t believethem. The psychiatric definition of ‘delusional’ is: ‘A false belief stronglyheld in spite of invalidating evidence, especially as a symptom of mentalillness: delusions of persecution’. Okay, then how come no-conspiracy theoristsare not considered ‘delusional’ when they believed there were weapons of massdestruction in Iraq just because those in authority told them this was the case?Ah, but, you see, not to believe in conspiracies is more credible to academiabecause it supports the establishment version of events. It is like believing inextraterrestrial life. The idea that life as we know it has only evolved on thistiny little planet and nowhere else in the perceived vastness of space isconsidered credible, because that’s the establishment’s view that people likeChris French are there to serve. As a result, to believe that there has to beother life ‘out there’ is considered ‘delusional’ – ‘He believes in little greenmen’, and all that crap. There is no better example of this phenomenon that Icall ‘reverse-credibility’, than the Islamic hijackers theory about 9/11. It iscredible to believe that nineteen hijackers who failed or struggled to flyone-engined Cessnas could suddenly manifest the ability to fly massive airlinerswith the most extraordinary skill. But, to say that this claim is clearlynonsense is a ‘conspiracy theory’ that attracts dismissal from people likeFrench. He was trying to defend the official 9/11 story during our chat,including the hijacker-pilots-who-couldn’t-fly-still-flew-767s-theory.I asked him for his definition of delusional with regard to his survey and hesaid it was those who answered ‘yes’ to questions like: Do you think thateveryone is being tracked by their mobile phone? Once again, whether they are ornot is never addressed by French and company. Only his interpretation of theanswer matters. The fact is that everyone can be tracked by their cell phone andmany are when they are being particularly targeted. I don’t believe thateveryone is, because most people are no problem to authority and so there is nopoint. However, to believe that it might be happening when surveillance isincreasing by the day is now considered ‘delusional’. French doesn’t know if thestatement is true or false, but he believes it to be false and so anyone whothinks it might be going on must be delusional. After all, he can’t be wrong.French told me there was no evidence for what I was saying in my books about aglobal conspiracy to impose an Orwellian state. I asked him the obviousquestion: Have you read any of them? His answer … ‘No’. This is absolutelytypical of his breed and I have met so many of these academic clones who parrottheir song sheet ‘science’ and song sheet ‘psychology’. They are not interestedin evidence, only their own theories. Indeed, they are no-conspiracy theoristswho never bother to check out the validity of what is being claimed by actuallyresearching the evidence. I said I couldn’t take him seriously when he wassaying on one hand that there was no evidence and yet not even bothering to readeven one of my books to see what evidence was being presented. ‘I knew you wouldtake that line’, he said. Well, what other ‘line’ is there to take in thecircumstances? If someone had rigid views on what it is like to travel by trainwhen they had never been near a railway station, people like French would saythey had a psychological flaw. Yet, that’s exactly what he and his colleaguesdo. They have concrete opinions without even a cursory look at the evidence, andthen accuse people of being delusional for believing in something when, in theunresearched opinion of people like Chris French, there is no evidence! They arelooking themselves in the mirror and they are too full of their ownself-importance to see it.When I challenged French about dismissing evidence that he hadn’t even botheredto read, he said he knew what I was saying from articles he had read in themedia. Given that we are talking about one of the most misrepresented people ofrecent times, I had to laugh at the idea that anyone could find out what I wasreally saying, and with what evidence, from the news media. But, then, from themoment I began talking with the guy, I knew I was in Fairyland. He told me thatmy work was based on a document called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,which he claimed was a ‘proven fake’. I asked him how he knew that my books werebased on that. He had seen it in the papers. The fact that this was provablenonsense, as a read of my books would immediately confirm, was once againirrelevant to him. What I found most fascinating was to see this no-conspiracytheorist act in precisely the same way he claims for those ‘conspiracytheorists’ that he so dismisses.> •He says that people believe in conspiracies without any evidence.> •Yet he believes there is no conspiracy without looking at the evidence.> •He says that ‘conspiracy theorists’ make everything fit their theory.> •Yet he was constantly trying to find ways to make everything fit his> no-conspiracy theory.Chris French was everything he was accusing others of being. I asked him what hethought of the FBI claim to have found a paper passport from one of the ‘9/11hijackers’ near the Twin Towers, despite the planes crashing in fireballs, thetowers turning to dust and thousands of bodies never being recovered. He told methat he had seen a story once of a gas explosion in a house that had caused lotsof damage, but the person inside got out unscathed. I said that the FBI hadnever produced the passport and, a year after they called a news conference toannounce they had found it, the Bureau had told a British television documentaryteam that the find of a hijacker’s passport was ‘a rumour that might be true’.Now French theory one, that the paper passport did actually survive, was in deeptrouble, and another had to be conjured immediately. Maybe, he said, there hadbeen a mix-up in communication and the people who held the news conference hadbeen told it had been found when it wasn’t. Had he ever checked that out? No.Would he ever check it out? No. As long as it could give his no-conspiracytheory an escape route, that’s all that concerned him. The common thread of ourconversation was that French had to find a way of explaining everything to fithis theory. Any possibility that events could be orchestrated to achieve anoutcome had no chance of breaching his firewall. He accuses others ofconstructing ‘conspiracy theories’ to make sense of a complex world when he isconstructing no-conspiracy theories in precisely the same way.French is not alone either. He’s a blueprint, a program, which you find in thesame positions all over the world. I was on a Canadian television news show afew years ago with a university psychologist straight off the production linethat produced Chris French. He said that people believed in conspiracy theoriesbecause they had to find a way of making sense of a complex world. That isexactly what French said to me, almost word-for-word, because they share thesame computer reality. I asked this Canadian guy to tell me about the BilderbergGroup. He wouldn’t answer and banged on with his no-conspiracy theory. He thensaid that if what I was saying was true, why were the authorities allowing me tospeak in Vancouver? I pointed out that we had spent the last month changingvenues as each one pulled out under pressure not to let me speak, and that abook signing at a major bookstore had been banned that very week for the samereason. Again, he had done no background research; it was justacademic-repeating from the land of the textbook mind. The guy made a right pratof himself, but walked away oblivious of this fact.After the television filming, Chris French asked me if I would give a talk tothe ‘Skeptics Society’ in a London pub. I said no, because there was no point.The Skeptics Society is a forum for concrete psyches ‘devoted to promotingscientific skepticism and resisting the spread of pseudoscience, superstition,and irrational beliefs’. It would be like talking to a wall and I have one infront of me that I can use without any need to travel. People say it’s good tobe skeptical, or sceptical as we spell the word in Britain, but it isn’t. It isgood to question and research, but that’s not the same as being sceptical. Asceptic is someone who comes from a fixed position and then filters all evidenceto the contrary, and the main method is by always finding another explanationfor something, no matter how far-fetched and ludicrous. By finding another meansof explaining away something that challenges their fixed position, they canmaintain the fixed position; and that’s the whole idea of the exercise:defending their beliefs. It is irrelevant if the explanations they come with upare not valid – they never bother to research that. So long as they can findsomething, anything, that’s all they need to preserve the perception. Look atthat line again about the Skeptics Society: ‘… devoted to promoting scientificskepticism and resisting the spread of pseudoscience, superstition, andirrational beliefs’. Who decides what is pseudoscience, superstition, andirrational belief? They do, from their fixed belief in how things are. I havemet a number of these people and many of them are utterly desperate to find waysof dismissing anything that is different to the norms that they slavishlyworship. This slavery to ‘scientific’ and society ‘norms’ means the scepticsthat dismiss conspiracy research, like that related to 9/11, are the same peoplewho attack and ridicule any suggestion of the so-called ‘paranormal’. I havefound this again and again with these characters. So, it was a head-shaker whenI went to Chris French’s webpage after our meeting to check out some morebackground about what he did. This is what I found:> My current research focuses on two main areas. The first is the psychology of> paranormal beliefs and of ostensibly paranormal experiences. Although a large> proportion of the population believes in the paranormal, the evidence> presented to support paranormal claims is generally not very convincing in> scientific terms. It would appear that on most (and perhaps all) occasions> when individuals claim to have directly experienced the paranormal, plausible> non-paranormal alternative explanations can be found. > These alternative accounts often rely on the imperfections in human> information-processing studied by cognitive psychologists, such as those> related to memory, perception, and judgement. The psychology of deception and> self-deception is also of relevance in this area. I often appear on the> television and radio offering a sceptical perspective on a variety of> paranormal claims. I have recently set up the Anomalistic Psychology Research> Unit within the Department to act as a focus for research in this area. That’s what a closed mind does for you. You don’t research to discover anew; you‘research’ to confirm your current beliefs. Most of academia is anotherreligion, another belief system repelling all borders. Academia often condemnsand ridicules religion when it is one and operates in the same way. What unitesall religions? Concrete minds.Politicians and media won’t do it – that leaves us …Fortunately, the world is waking up to the truth about September 11th despitethe poodle politicians and the moron media. The attacks, ‘hit pieces’ andcondemnation of 9/11 investigators prove that point. A familiar sequence isunfolding once again: (1) Ignore them and they will go away; (2) If they don’tgo away and people start to listen then attack them in every way possible; (3)If that doesn’t work ... double the toilet roll order. Stage three is now withinour sights if we are not deflected by ridicule and hostility. It was a lonelyroad to tread in the aftermath of 9/11 when I was saying that it was an insidejob, a Problem-Reaction-Solution designed to advance the Orwellian global state.To the mainstream of public perception I was from the twilight zone, one of thelunatic fringe of ‘conspiracy theorists’ to be lumped together with flat earthbelievers and those who talked of fairies in the garden. Amazingly, even many ofthose who have come into the 9/11 truth movement years after the event still seeme in those terms, because I suggest a bigger conspiracy than they do. One 9/11‘truther’ even told a television documentary team that he would not beinterviewed for the programme if I was. Rigid belief systems are everywhere,even among those who think they have seen the light.I have a simple philosophy that has kept me going through the ‘wilderness years’in relation to 9/11 and much else. If what you are saying is true it willeventually be proved to be so. Keep walking and talking, no matter what thereaction, and if the information stands up the struggle and abuse will be worthit in the end. Too often people shut up and walk away when others are notlistening, or reacting with ridicule and contempt. What the hell use is that? Itjust leaves the field to the liars, cheats and serial killers.Interest in my own work increased substantially after the publication of Alicein Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster in 2002 when the dots could beconnected and the picture seen. However, it was in the wake of the Iraq invasionthat I noticed a transformation in attitude and the opening of minds to, atleast the possibility, that there was more to know about 9/11. This happened fortwo main reasons. Firstly, the early pioneers of the conspiracy version of thoseattacks had been followed by many others, and by 2003 the Internet was becominga library of information and questions that undermined (not difficult) theoriginal credibility of the official explanation. The fact that this‘credibility’ depended only on repetition of the lie and the suppression in themainstream of alternative views, meant that the house of cards was vulnerable tothe slightest nudge. Even the most simple of questions was met with the mostimplausible, often impossible, of answers.The second turning point in the emerging acceptance of a 9/11 conspiracy werethe lies about Iraq and ‘weapons of mass destruction’. It’s a strange humantrait that people constantly dismiss politicians and journalists asuntrustworthy liars and then believe them over something like 9/11. Opinionpolls all over the world list politicians and journalists as the top professionsnot to be trusted, together with people like lawyers and bankers. We hear allthe time that ‘you can’t believe what you read in the newspapers’, but often thevery people who say that do believe it. The invasion of Iraq gave the public asymbolic smack around the face to awaken them to this comical contradiction. Itwas like: ‘Oh yeah, they do lie don’t they, sorry I forgot’. After weapons ofmass destruction were not found in Iraq, when they were supposed to be the veryreason for the war, I felt a real shift in public attitudes. When this wasfollowed by leaked documents proving that the war was planned and agreed longbefore Bush and Blair claimed – see Tales From The Time Loop for the detailedbackground to Iraq – the shift strengthened and spilled over into the conspiracyversion of 9/11. It still amazes me that there can be anyone who still believesthe official history of those attacks when it is parroted by the same people,never mind even the same agencies, who provably lied to us over Iraq and WMD.Are we really so naive as to believe that those who lie so comprehensively aboutone will tell us the truth about the other? Ever-increasing numbers are notfalling for it anymore, and the official story and its mendacious advocates arecoming under more and more scrutiny. All these years later, even many academics,at first accepting, are now at the forefront of the exposure movement that hasexploded since around 2004. So, too, are professional demolition and aviationexperts, pilots, building engineers, and even some former Bush officials (Figure200).Image [../Images/00209.jpg]Figure 200: The dyke is breaking There are so many levels to the conspiracy, but in the ‘five-sense’ ‘world’ thatwe perceive as our daily reality, what happened on September 11th 2001 is thekey to so much. To use other analogies, it is the card that holds the housetogether or the banana beneath the juggler’s feet. The fascist agenda dependsfor its very survival on the continued credibility of September 11th. Withoutit, there was no excuse to invade Afghanistan; no excuse to take our freedomsaway; no excuse for all that goes with the ‘war on terror’. If the officialstory isn’t true, which it clearly isn’t, why did Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Blairand the rest of them tell us such lies and do such deadly deeds in its name? If9/11 goes, it all goes, no demolition charges necessary, no dynamite required.And it is going. That is why it is so vital that we go on with still renewedvigour posing the questions and presenting the evidence that will complete theprocess of demolishing the deceit.It is the people who must do that because the media won’t and the politicianswon’t. We have come so far against all the odds – now let’s finish the job."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 18 Free to do as we tell you > Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles> and misguided men. > Martin Luther King You would really need a mind of solid steel, encased in concrete and dropped inthe ocean deeps not to see that the Orwellian society is with us today. Sadly,and in testament to the scale of programming absorbed by the human psyche, manystill don’t see the painfully obvious. Maybe only jackboots on the front stepwill crack their code.The blatant reality is that Big Brother is not coming, he’s here. The onlyquestion left is how deeply we are going to allow his fascist tendencies tocontrol our lives – and we don’t have long to decide. The Reptilian hybrids andtheir interlocking networks that link government with transnationalcorporations, media and military have used their engineered horrors, especially9/11, to introduce the Orwellian society on a scale, and at a speed, never seenin known human history. Problem-Reaction-Solution, the Totalitarian Tiptoe, andan unquestioning, subservient, media, have taken us to the brink of thefully-blown global fascist state that I have been warning about all these years.Most people laughed at first and thought it was crazy, but the sniggers havesubsided with the passage of events, especially since September 11th.The goal all along has been to manipulate the population into accepting the lossof more and more freedom until there is so much control that the fly is caughtin the web and can no longer resist. The plan has been to divert attention fromwhat they are doing so that as many as possible can be kidded for as long aspossible that nothing sinister is happening. The longer they can delay a massawakening to what is going on, the better chance they have of locking the celldoor before most people even realise they are in jail. This is why diversion isso important to the Reptilian hybrid strategy, and the biggest one is the bogus‘war on terror’ that emerged, as planned, from the Reptilian hybrid attack onAmerica on September 11th. While the invasion and daily horrors in Iraq havefocused public and political attention, all the elements of an Orwellian worldhave been speeding into law.Off we go …By October 26th 2001, just weeks after the attacks, Boy Bush had signed thePatriot Act, or to use its full and ridiculous title: The Uniting andStrengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept andObstruct Terrorism Act of 2001. Talk about Orwellian-speak and the short name‘Patriot Act’ was designed to equate patriotism with allowing freedoms to becurtailed for the good of the country. Anyone who opposed its extremism wasbeing ‘unpatriotic’. It passed through the House of Representatives by 357 votesto 66 and the Senate by 98 to 1, and almost none of those who voted had read theBill at any length – most not at all. It was also clear that the legislation hadbeen drafted before the attacks of 9/11. The Patriot Act, which was renewed inMarch 2006, changed immigration laws, banking laws and money laundering laws. Itused the excuse of ‘fighting terrorism’ to massively increase the government’sability to watch, track and spy on the population, and hold people withoutcharge or trial. Most of the powers are not confined to ‘terrorism’investigations, which was just the manufactured excuse to get it into law. Theyapply to any criminal investigations and decisions about what and who should beinvestigated by the Reptilian hybrid-controlled agencies of government and‘law-enforcement’. The idea is to so widen the legal definition of ‘terrorist’that peaceful protest is included, and they are already well on their way withthe streams of new laws that have followed 9/11. The key label is ‘terrorist’,as The Washington Post reported:> The Bush administration is developing a parallel legal system in which> terrorism suspects – US citizens and noncitizens alike – may be investigated,> jailed, interrogated, tried and punished without legal protections guaranteed> by the ordinary system, lawyers inside and outside the government say. The Patriot Act created a new crime called ‘domestic terrorism’ which is definedas: (1) acts deemed dangerous to human life in violation of the criminal laws ofthe US, or of any state; (2) acts that appear intended to intimidate or coerce acivilian population, influence the policy of a government by intimidation orcoercion, or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction,assassination or kidnapping within the territorial jurisdiction of the USgovernment. The wording gives the authorities, as intended, enormous scope forinterpretation, for instance … ‘acts that appear intended to … influence thepolicy of a government by intimidation or coercion’. That could easily be a massdemonstration against government policy. As I said earlier, the Reptilianhybrids are highly skilled in the use of words in their drafting of laws to givethem powers well beyond what appears to be the scope of the legislation. Whenlater someone challenges what they are doing as unlawful, they come back with …‘No, look, it’s in the Act, clause 153, sub clause four – it’s the phrase inLatin that says we can do anything we like’. Professor Susan Herman of theBrooklyn Law School highlighted this approach in an Internet commentary on thePatriot Act:> It is less obvious how the balance of power has been shifted in the domestic> war against terrorism because the provisions of the enormous USA Patriot Act> are only the tip of an iceberg of amended legislation. Most of its provisions> amend previous law by adding or deleting words, paragraphs, or sections,> forcing people reading the legislation to embark on an elaborate treasure> hunt, tracking each amendment back to try to determine its impact on the> previous law. In addition, it is difficult to comprehend the new changes if> one is not already conversant with labyrinthine webs of law in many different> areas. Image [../Images/00210.jpg]Figure 201: ‘Terrorist’ laws are not only, or even primarily, aimed at‘terrorists’. They are there to entrap the entire population All this was done between September 11th and when the Act was introduced to theHouse of Representatives on October 23rd? What we can say for sure is that basicrights and freedoms have been slaughtered by the Patriot Act and its connectedlegislation. It gives a virtual free hand to government agencies (under thecontrol of the same masters) to target anyone they choose with every means ofsurveillance at their disposal. Checks and balances are all but removed, and theAct is aimed not only at foreign nationals, but the American people. The same ishappening in Britain and elsewhere (Figure 201). Even then, the Bushadministration was caught wiretapping the population beyond the bounds of thisvirtual free-for-all. The laws are for public consumption only. What they do iswhat they choose to do, and their aim is not to stay within the law, but not toget caught breaking it. That’s the only crime from their point of view. Look atthe surveillance they can now ‘lawfully’ carry out and then at least double it.Wherever we go, what we say on the phone or the Internet, what we purchase andwhere, can now all be recorded and monitored and there is so much more to comeif we just sit back and allow it. The surveillance and control laws enacted inthe United States can be seen all over the world even in countries where thereis absolutely no ‘terrorist threat’, because this is nothing to do withprotecting people from terrorists. How could it be when the terrorists are ingovernment making these laws? The whole reason for the Patriot Act and similarlegislation is to impose the controls necessary to imprison the population bythe time enough of them see what is going on. The Reptilian hybrid networks ineach country connect with the global web and through this system the same lawsare being passed everywhere.‘Endemic surveillance’The United Kingdom is leading the way in surveillance of its people, and if whatis happening here is not yet introduced in your country, then be sure that thisis what they have in store for you also. Figures published by the human rightsgroup, Privacy International, suggest Britain is the worst Western ‘democracy’at protecting individual privacy. The two worst countries in thethirty-six-nation survey were Malaysia and China, and Britain was in the bottomfive with what was called ‘endemic surveillance’. Even Richard Thomas, theBritish government’s information commissioner, has warned that we could ‘sleepwalk into a surveillance society’. The only thing I disagree with is the use ofthe future tense. It is happening now. Thomas was commenting on a report by theSurveillance Studies Network, a group of academics, presented to theInternational Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners’ Conference in London in2006. The report said there were 4.2 million CCTV cameras in the UK alone,that’s around one for every fourteen people. The UK Home Office spent anastonishing 78 per cent of its crime prevention budget in the 1990s oninstalling the cameras and when you walk through towns and cities you areconstantly monitored and recorded as you pass from camera to camera (Figure202). On average, British people are caught on some three hundred surveillancecameras every day and at one street junction alone in the London borough ofHammersmith there are twenty-nine cameras run by police, government, privatecompanies and transport agencies. At the London police headquarters at ScotlandYard, a giant bank of television screens monitors the capital and officers canswitch to any area and zoom in on the face of anyone they choose. Police evenwant cameras mounted on their heads.Image [../Images/00211.jpg]Figure 202: ‘Every move you make, every step you take, we’ll be watching you …’ There are six thousand speed cameras in the UK, eight thousand number platerecognition devices, with technology on the way to photograph anyone using theirmobile phone at the wheel, or not wearing a seat belt. In March 2006, the LondonMetropolitan Police took possession of ‘eye in the sky’ cameras that can readnumber plates from helicopters thousands of feet above the ground, whileremotely-controlled ‘drone’ aircraft are to be used in Scotland to spy onpeople. Meanwhile, the British Parliament has called for even more speed cameraswhen a government report found that 85 per cent of road accidents are notconnected to drivers breaking the speed limit. But then it’s not about speed,it’s about control. ‘The level of surveillance in this country should shockpeople,’ said David Murakami Wood, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle whoheaded the Surveillance Studies Network investigation. ‘It is infiltratingeverything we do’. Yes, and it’s meant to. It’s not just happening in the UK, itis planned to happen everywhere. Mayor Daley has said there will a surveillancecamera ‘on almost every block’ in Chicago by 2016, and the idiot chief ofHouston Police, Harold Hurtt, said he wants surveillance cameras in apartmentcomplexes, downtown streets, shopping malls and even private homes. RememberOrwell’s telescreens?The Surveillance Network researchers highlighted what they called‘dataveillance’, the combination of different sources of surveillance to invadeprivacy in every aspect of our lives. These include CCTV cameras, registrationplate recognition cameras, shop RFID microchip tags on products that we buy,mobile phones and mobile phone cameras, credit card transactions, store loyaltycards, satellite surveillance; electoral roll, medical records, phone-tapping,hidden cameras and bugs, monitoring at work, Internet cookies and keystrokeprogrammes, which allows the keys that you hit on your computer to be recordedand used to obtain passwords or encryption keys. This can also be employed tomonitor work rates for computer operators and the whole package is designed torecord our every movement twenty-four hours a day. The so-called Oyster cardused on the London Underground requires people to register their personaldetails so their every journey can be logged down to the minute. There are plansto expand this around the country. As a result of Blair’s Regulation ofInvestigatory Powers Bill, passed in 2000, Internet providers have to record oursurfing activity and provide this information to MI5. Phone calls, emails andfaxes are being monitored by the Echelon spy network that searches for key wordsand voice recognition patterns. Some of the ground stations for theUS-controlled Echelon system are at Menwith Hill (Yorkshire, UK); Morwenstow(Cornwall, UK); the Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station(Geraldton, Western Australia); Pine Gap (Northern Territory, near AliceSprings, Australia); Misawa Air Base (Japan); Sabana Seca (Puerto Rico, US);Sugar Grove (West Virginia, US); Yakima (Washington, US); and Waihopai (NewZealand).Genetic data gatheringThe UK plan is to link all these sources of surveillance and control, includingthe confidential medical records of fifty million patients, with a centralcomputer system to allow every aspect of a person’s life, views, even thoughts,to be revealed on a single screen. This is one reason why the British governmentand others are proposing a ‘national database’. They say, yawn, yawn, that theyneed it to ‘fight crime’ and ‘fight terrorism’. The real aim is to monitor thegeneral population. The national database would include the emerging DNAdatabase which is designed to identify who has the Reptilian hybrid DNA and whodoesn’t, and to keep on file the unique DNA broadcast or vibrational code ofeveryone that I talked about in Chapter Two[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos153827]. With this information, people canbe accurately targeted with vibrational technology to disrupt their mental,emotional and ‘physical’ energy fields. In Britain, the police now take a DNAsample from everyone they arrest and it is kept on the database even if they aresubsequently not charged or found to be innocent. This includes, as of 2007,more than a million children and young people aged between ten and seventeen,who have never been cautioned or charged with any offence. Their aim is to haveevery child and adult on the database. Three twelve-year-olds in the EnglishWest Midlands had their DNA taken after being arrested for … breaking brancheswhile building a den. The British government has also passed legislation to makeevery offence arrestable, no matter how small, so that everyone can be added towhat is already the world’s biggest DNA database. The United States is planninga similar system and Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, has alreadycalled for a US national DNA and fingerprint database. The European Union isplanning to introduce this across Europe and it would be added to a European DNAand fingerprint database that is being made available to Homeland Security inthe United States. Oh, but we must ‘fight terrorism’, though, eh? In fact,immigration court records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in 2007revealed that only 0.0015 per cent of cases filed by the Department of HomelandSecurity were related to terrorism.The British Home Office has also announced that the whole of the European Unionwould now have access to its DNA, fingerprint and car registration databases.The pawns in uniform that take the DNA samples have no clue what it is reallyfor. They just do what they’re told, no questions asked, and the money is good.Only with the rarest of exceptions, like Ian Readhead, the Deputy ChiefConstable of Hampshire in England, does anyone in uniform speak out. Readheadquestioned the unlimited right to take DNA and he said in May 2007: ‘… Are wereally moving towards an Orwellian situation where cameras are at every streetcorner? … I really don't think that's the kind of country that I want to livein’. We need far more police officers like him with the guts to challenge theagenda and we need them quick. Helen Wallace, deputy director of GeneWatch UK,which campaigns against the abuse of genetic science, said: ‘Britain’s DNAdatabase is spiralling out of control. It could allow an unprecedented level ofgovernment surveillance’. DNA testing is promoted as a foolproof way of catchingcriminals, but there have been some laughable mistakes, including a man withParkinson’s disease who could barely dress himself, yet was charged withcommitting a burglary two hundred miles away. It had to be him, because therewas a thirty-seven million to one DNA match. But it wasn’t him, and the sillysods had to let him go.I know your face …The technologies now being introduced have long been developed in the secretresearch projects, mostly in the underground bases and facilities, many ofwhich, on the deepest and most secure levels, interact with Reptilian entities.The technology is held back until the time is opportune to ‘invent’ it, andcover stories are hatched for how this or that ‘new invention’ was developed ina garage or by some transnational research project. Often people are rewardedfor their services to the agenda by being given these technologies to produceand market. The ever-more sophisticated means of surveillance and controlhaven’t just happened at random. They are part of a long-planned strategy to doexactly what Orwell’s novel foresaw. In Germany, railway authorities are runninga ‘trial’ with biometric facial recognition software that enables computers topick out faces in a crowd. ‘We’re a couple of weeks into a pilot project that istesting technology designed to automatically detect terrorists or othercriminals entering trains and alert security personnel,’ said Jens Puls,director of corporate security at Deutsche Bahn. The real aim of those in theshadows is not primarily ‘terrorists’ and ‘criminals’, but dissidents whochallenge the fascist state once it is further installed. We are now moving waybeyond simple cameras. The British government has begun to introduce streetcameras with speakers that allow the ‘security’ guards to give orders to people.Mike Clark, a spokesman for Middlesbrough Council in the north east of England,said: ‘People are shocked when they hear the cameras talk, but when they seeeveryone else looking at them, they feel a twinge of conscience and comply’.That’s a wonderful Orwellian word … ‘comply’. Everyone must ‘comply’. There mustbe ‘compliance’. Middlesbrough has installed the speaker cameras so thatoperators can ‘chastise miscreants’ who drop coffee cups or ride bicycles toofast.I hear your voice …The aim is not only to give orders to the public through the surveillancesystem, but also hear what the public is saying. There are plans to introducemicrophones, already being used in the Netherlands, which filter out backgroundnoise and allow street conversations to be heard. The former British HomeSecretary, David Blunkett, Big Brother’s best friend in government, now has thenerve to say that these microphones ‘smacked of the surveillance state’. If hewas back in government he would be supporting them. The same is happening inAmerica where detection microphones allegedly to detect gunshots are being usedto monitor conversations. The makers say they can listen to someone two hundredyards away. What you say can be monitored through cell phones that can also giveyour location to within a few feet. There are plans for microphones incomputers, while cable and satellite TV technology already has microphones.Google, a company alleged to be connected with the CIA, has said it will usemicrophones to listen to ‘background noise’, like television, music and radio,and use those choices to target advertising. All these major, and not so major,Internet companies are assets of the surveillance networks and now we are seeingthe inevitable attack on Internet freedom of speech as they seek to remove thedownside of the Web from their perspective (the free flow of information) whilekeeping the upside (the ability to track, spy and profile people). Thecorporations are hijacking the peoples’ Internet, which is itself made possibleby military technology. Once you reach this scale of surveillance, and thereforedictatorship, we are in serious schtuck. But there’s still more. One of thelatest proposals is for concealed X-ray cameras in public places, like the onesused in airports, that can see through clothes and photograph you naked. A sanesociety would ban this on health grounds alone, but what happens to humans isirrelevant to these people. They just want control at any price.I know what you’re thinking …Lie detectors are being used ever more widely and the aim is to remove evenfreedom of thought by using mind-reading technology. The Chicago Tribunereported the development of one such magnetic resonance imaging machine at theUniversity of Illinois, which tracks the firing of neurons to reveal howreal-time thoughts are formed. Dr Keith Thulborn, director of UIC’s Center forMR Research, where the machine is located, said the main goal is to find outwhat people are thinking. ‘We’d like to get to the stage of reading thoughts’,he said. But why unless it is to remove the last frontier of freedom? MarthaFarah, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for CognitiveNeuroscience, said she has worries over how people may use such technology.‘People may be thrown in jail for being suspected terrorists on the basis of abrain scan.’ They’ve already been jailed for less. Orwell’s mind-readingtechnology is also far more advanced than people believe. There is the ‘penileplethysmograph’ which has been used to try to detect ‘homosexual or paedophilethoughts’. A stretchable band with mercury inside is fitted around the subject’spenis and the band is connected to a machine with a video screen and datarecorder. Any changes in penis size, even those not felt by the subject, arerecorded while the subject views sexually suggestive or pornographic pictures,slides, or movies, or listens to audiotapes with descriptions of such things aschildren being molested. Computer software is used to develop graphs showing‘the degree of arousal to each stimulus’. Magnetic resonance imaging is used todetect brain chemical activity allegedly corresponding to memory or thoughts.These and other technologies have been proposed as a way of detecting ‘badthoughts’ and these are just the start of what they have planned.All this is leading, as I have been saying for so long, to microchipped people(Figure 203). In 1994, when I was writing the first edition of And The TruthShall Set You Free, I said that this was one of the agenda’s main goals and nowwe are seeing it happen. The pressure to introduce ID cards is only aTotalitarian Tiptoe to microchips. The British government told us that ID cardswould be voluntary and then announced that you basically won’t be able to doanything, including get a passport, unless you agree to have one. The idea is todo the same with microchips, introduce them ‘voluntarily’ and then make themcompulsory – first through making it difficult to live in the system withoutone, and then by law. The chips in credit and other cards are one step fromchips under the skin. Even now, you don’t have to take those London UndergroundOyster Cards out of your pocket because they are read automatically by radiowaves and it’s the same with the new microchipped passports. It is only one stepto embed this technology permanently under the skin. In December 2005, the GioveA satellite was sent into orbit as part of the Galileo European navigationsystem. This will allow ‘Galileo chips’ to be embedded in devices of every kindto be read by the satellite, but the real target is humanity.Image [../Images/00212.jpg]Figure 203: Bye, bye freedom The United States appears to lead the world in the use of human microchips,thanks to the vociferous work of a deeply sinister company that I identified inmy books many years ago. This is the VeriChip Corporation and it is part of anoperation called Applied Digital. These ‘VeriChips’ are being marketed as a wayof keeping us safe or, as the company says on its website – ‘Safeguarding what’simportant to you’. Yes, so long as freedom is not important to you. The VeriChipCorporation is now aggressively marketing human microchips to hospitals (the‘VeriMed Physician Network’), for Alzheimer’s patients and as security devices.The company claims it is the first operational human chip that can be linked tothe global positioning satellite tracking systems. It will allow your every moveanywhere on the planet to be tracked from satellite, and is also designed toconnect with the Internet and become a user-identity device for the Web. It isdescribed as a ‘dime-sized’ implant, inserted just under the skin and the chipwill be powered ‘electromechanically’ through the movement of muscles. It can beactivated by the wearer or the monitoring technology (Figure 204). It has,according to the official statements, been developed by Dr Peter Zhou and hisresearch team, and has progressed ‘ahead of schedule’. As I have said, theReptilian hybrid agenda is not dependent on the necessary technology becomingavailable by accident. It is developed well in advance and introduced in linewith the planned timescale. The tax-exempt foundations, like the RockefellerFoundation, give massive sums to scientific research, but, as a US CongressionalCommittee established as far back as the 1950s, they don’t lose control of howthe money is spent and insist that the research serves the needs of the globalagenda.Image [../Images/00213.jpg]Figure 204: The VeriChip The Illuminati-controlled Princeton University was involved in the developmentof the VeriChip along with the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Dr Peter Zhouwas the chief scientist at DigitalAngel.net [http://DigitalAngel.net] Inc., awholly owned subsidiary of Applied Digital. He stresses the benefits for peoplebecoming human robots connected to a satellite, and he said he was excited abouthis chip’s ability to save lives by monitoring medical conditions and giving anexact location to rescue services. I predicted many years ago that this would beone of the ways they would sell the chip to people when the time came for itsintroduction. I also said that another marketing ruse would be to stress that ifyou microchip your children you would always know where they were. This isindeed being used now after the success of the ‘chip your dog and you’ll neverlose him’ campaign that was part of the Totalitarian Tiptoe to microchip people.The more children that go missing or are murdered, and the more they promote thedanger of paedophiles in the community, the more likely parents are to befrightened into microchipping their kids. A guy called David Adair, who says hehas worked on high-tech projects with NASA, was on the New Age lecture circuitin America for years extolling the benefits of microchipping our children. Icannot believe that someone with his insider knowledge of secret technologywould be unaware of what that would really mean in terms of tagging and control.Applied Digital’s Dr Zhou said that the implant would become as popular as cellphones and vaccines (one of which fries your brain and the other suppresses yourintellect and undermines your immune system). Dr Zhou then delivered thesechilling words:> Digital Angel will be a connection from yourself to the electronic world. It> will be your guardian, protector. It will bring good things to you. We will be> a hybrid of electronic intelligence and our own soul. Now we get to the real reason for the microchip agenda. The Reptilian hybridsare terrified that too many people will wake up and bring an end to theircontrol, and a multi-levelled assault has been launched against us mentally,emotionally and physically to keep us closed down and in the box – their box.This includes chemical additives to food and water, electromagnetic pollution,manipulation of the DNA and, the most important of all, the microchip. All theseinvasions of the human body are to re-wire and destabilise our energy fields sothey don’t connect with the great beyond, the Infinite All, and hold us in thebody – computer – level of reality. Today’s children and young people are beingespecially targeted, because they will be adults when the change is at itsheight. The Reptilian hybrids can’t tell the truth about why they are pressingfor human microchipping and so they make up excuses. This is one reason whyleading politicians lie so much. They are giving us cover stories – lies – tohide the real reason for what they do and this means they must lie at least mostof the time. Preventing credit card fraud is one excuse for the chip, and theaim is to bring in the cashless society, the one-world currency. This would meanthat if the computer system said no to your credit card, or eventually yourmicrochip, you have no means, other than barter, to buy anything, includingfood. At the moment, you can still overcome this by using cash and this is whythey want to phase out physical money. Readers of my other books will know thatI have been predicting the microchipped cashless society since the early 1990s,and in 2007 Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe, predicted the end ofcash within a few years.Professor Kevin Warwick of Reading University in England has been very publiclyused to promote the use of the human microchip. He was implanted with a chipamid great publicity and has introduced us all to the benefits of controllingelectronic devices at a distance. Wow. The latest I heard was that he and hiswife, Irena, were going to be implanted with another chip which would connecttheir nervous systems to data processors, batteries and radio transmitters.Apparently, their teenage daughter, Madeleine, was asked to join the exercise,but said ‘No way’. There is at least one thinking member of the family, then.‘This is the next step of merging man and machine,’ said Professor Warwick. ‘Wewill be able to have communications between two nervous systems across the Net.’He is being funded, according to the London Daily Mail, to the tune of some halfa million pounds by major US Internet firms. Professor Warwick admits that heand his wife could suffer permanent physical damage to their arms, but addedthat he hoped ‘there will be no mental damage’. One wonders how they would tell.Warwick has been a vociferous supporter of microchipping and it was he whosuggested the microchipping of children after the murders of ten-year-old HollyWells and Jessica Chapman in 2002. Warwick was chipped so that he could interactwith technology through a connection to his central nervous system. His websitesays:> Kevin Warwick has taken the first steps … using himself as a guinea pig> test-subject receiving, by surgical operation, technological implants> connected to his central nervous system … Overriding everything, at the> expense of a normal life, is Kevin’s all encompassing scientific quest and> desire to be a Cyborg … part human, part machine. Electronic thought controlWarwick’s level of knowledge is not in the same universe as that available tothe secret projects that are waiting to foist the real deal upon us. Opponentsof microchipping normally focus on their use in tracking people, but there ismuch more to this, including the control of thought, emotion and thus behaviour.Thought patterns can be transmitted through the chips that the target takes tobe their own and this can go as far as generating apparent ‘voices in the head’and hallucinations. Forget about the fixing of ‘elections’ through dodgyelectronic voting machines. If we are stupid enough to succumb to the chip,there will be no need. Dr Rauni-Leena Luukanen-Kilde, former provincial medicalofficer of the Finnish Lapland Province, has been a tireless campaigner againsthuman chipping. She says:> Every thought, reaction, hearing, and visual observation causes a certain> neurological potential, spikes, and patterns in the brain and its> electromagnetic fields, which can now be decoded into thoughts, pictures, and> voices. Electromagnetic stimulation can therefore change a person’s brainwaves> and affect muscular activity, causing painful muscular cramps experienced as> torture … > … The [United States National Security Agency’s] … electronic surveillance> system can simultaneously follow and handle millions of people. Each of us has> a unique bioelectrical resonance frequency in the brain, just as we have> unique fingerprints.

US astronauts were implanted before they> were sent into space so their thoughts could be followed and all their> emotions could be registered 24 hours a day. I was told all this in 1997 by a CIA scientist who was desperate to alert peopleto what was planned. He had asked to meet me because he was a scientist workingagainst his will on CIA secret projects orchestrated by the Reptilian hybridnetworks that the fodder politicians have no idea are going on. When I asked himwhy he used his genius to advance the agenda, he opened his shirt and on hischest was a see-through ‘sachet’, similar to those used for shampoo. The CIAcalls them ‘patches’ and inside I could see an orangey-golden liquid. He saidthat he joined the CIA in the belief that he was serving his country, but hesoon realised that they did not want his knowledge to help humanity. The ideawas to control them. When he began to rebel against the misuse of his work, heleft home one morning and remembers nothing else until he woke up on amedical-type table. When he began to focus, he noticed the ‘patch’ on his chest.They had manipulated his body to need the drug the patch contains and it has tobe replaced every seventy-two hours. If he doesn’t do what he’s told, they don’treplace the patch and he begins to die a long and painful death. He knowsthey’re not kidding – he’s already tried it. Large numbers of brilliantscientists, who could be setting the world free from poverty and hunger, are inthe same situation. This CIA scientist told me about the microchipping agendaand much else besides. He arranged to meet me to expose what was being planned,not least because he had no idea how long they would allow him to live. Whenthese scientists have served their purpose, the patch is no longer replaced andthey die painfully, taking with them the knowledge of what is going on.Before he talked about the microchip agenda, he told me many other secrets keptfrom the public. He said that the cure for cancer has been known for decades,but they didn’t want people to be cured so they would not release thisinformation. They were making far more money drugging the dying and treating thesymptoms than they ever would curing the disease. This is archetypal Reptilianhybrid behaviour. They have also been alarmed by the explosion in the humanpopulation, hence their plan for a mass ‘cull’ of the ‘lower races’. Thescientist said the technology existed to create abundant growth in desertswithout water by stimulating the energy fields of the plants. At its optimum, itwas like watching a time-lapse photograph, so fast did they grow, he said. Thiswould eliminate hunger by itself if it were made available. Instead, this sametechnology was used to kill thousands of people in a mass murder that hewitnessed. The CIA had gathered a multitude together in Ethiopia during a famineby the promise of food, and he was in a plane that he thought was flying overthe area to cast a vibrational field across the land to stimulate plant growth.When he came to the front of the plane to see what was happening, he sawthousands of people lying dead. They had been killed by the power of themagnetic field. The CIA was testing his technology as a weapon that could killpeople, but not damage property. Anyone still think that these lunatics wouldnot have coldly murdered 3,000 people on September 11th? The scientist also saidthat the technology to give us all the power and warmth we need withoutpollution or utility bills – free energy – has been known for decades. I amaware of this from people I have met who are producing these systems, but theycan’t get them into production. The Reptilian hybrids control the patentoffices, the money, and the major companies required to mass-produce them.Imagine a piece of kit in your home giving you warmth and power every dayforever without cost. Again, this technology uses the pool of unseen vibratingenergy all around us and turns it into usable power. All this technology wouldbe ours today if it were not suppressed by the Illuminati cabal.However, it was when he turned to microchips that the CIA scientist became mostanimated. He confirmed that the plan was to microchip the entire globalpopulation, including babies at birth. Once babies are chipped the moment theyare born it means that no consciousness could enter this reality without beingsubject to the consciousness-suppressing microchip. It is the Reptilian hybridplan to have life-long control of anyone entering this reality and hold them inthe vibrational box.

On one level the chips werethere to keep a constant track of where we are and what we are doing, but themain reason was to manipulate at will our mental and emotional processes. Hesaid that people should not only think about the messages going from the chip tothe computer – far more important were the messages from the computer to theembodied chip. He said people had no comprehension of the level of technology inthe Illuminati secret projects. Once people were chipped, he said, the computercould make them docile or aggressive, sexually aroused or sexually suppressed,and close down their minds to a point where they were like zombies. He asked meto urge people to resist the microchip at all costs. Once we concede to that wewould be nothing more than machines controlled by the ‘aliens’ that he confirmedwere behind the whole thing. He told me how small the microchips were outsidethe public arena and this has since proved to be true. Thanks to what is called‘nano technology’, they are invisible to the human eye and can easily beimplanted through vaccination programmes and other means. By comparison, eventhe VeriChip is the technological stone age. In January 2007, the chip makers,Intel, announced that it would now be producing processors using transistorswith features just forty-five nanometres (a billionth of a metre) wide. IBM,Toshiba, Sony and AMD are going the same way.Remember, the human body is a holographic biological computer and can behijacked electronically. Human microchipping is designed to hack into thebody-computer and manipulate its electrochemical systems – thoughts, emotionsand ‘physical’ health. The central processing unit or CPU (the ‘brain’ of apersonal computer) is a microchip. Human microchipping is the implantation of adevice that can override the brain. They say they can ‘interface’ body andcomputers and this is possible because they are connecting two computers. Forgoodness sake, say NO to the microchip.From the dragon’s mouth …The award-winning American film producer, Aaron Russo, who produced TradingPlaces with Eddie Murphy, said publicly in 2007 that he was told by one of theRockefeller family that the plan was to create a microchipped population. Hesaid that Nick Rockefeller also predicted an ‘event’ that would lead toinvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq eleven months before 9/11, and said that theRockefeller Foundation had created and funded the women’s liberation movement todestroy the family. Rockefeller further confirmed that reducing the populationwas another of their targets. Russo said Rockefeller was trying to recruit himinto the elite and he was asked if he would like to join the Council on ForeignRelations. When Russo said that he was not interested in enslaving people,Rockefeller asked why he cared about the ‘serfs’. ‘I used to say to him what’sthe point of all this?’, Russo said. ‘You have all the money in the world youneed, you have all the power you need, what’s the point, what’s the end goal?’Rockefeller replied that the goal was to get everybody chipped, to control thewhole of society, to have the bankers and the elite people control the world.Russo was told that if he joined them his chip would be specially coded to avoidunnecessary inspection by the authorities.Rockefeller revealed to him almost a year before 9/11 that there was going to bean event that would lead to the invasion of Afghanistan to run pipelines throughto the Caspian Sea. They were going to invade Iraq to take over the oil fieldsand establish a base in the Middle East and ‘go after Chavez in Venezuela’.Russo said that Rockfeller told him that he would see soldiers looking in cavesin Afghanistan and Pakistan for Osama bin Laden and that there would be an‘endless war on terror where there’s no real enemy’ and the whole thing is a‘giant hoax’. This would allow the government to take over the American people,Rockefeller had said, cynically laughing and joking as he spoke. Rockefellertold Russo about the two main reasons they bankrolled ‘women’s lib’. One wasthat before women’s lib the bankers couldn’t tax half the population, and thesecond was to allow them to get children into school at an earlier age andindoctrinate them into accepting the state as their primary family. Russo toldhow Rockefeller constantly stressed that ‘the people have to be ruled’ and thepopulation reduced by at least half. The conspiracy I am exposing here, and havebeen warning about since 1992, is no ‘theory’. In early 2007, policy reviewdocuments published by the Cabinet Office of the British Government revealed theextraordinary plans by Blair and his successors to ‘tackle crime’. Theseincluded microchipping the mentally ill and chemically castrating sex offenders.There had to be ‘trade-offs’ between liberty and security, the documents said.Microchipping the trashThe microchip is in almost every piece of technology and embedded in newer cars.This can externally immobilise the engine from satellite, as well as trackingevery journey. Even the rubbish or trash bins known as ‘wheelie bins’ in Britainare being chipped. I have said over and over that it is in the apparentlytrivial and insignificant that the true extent of control and surveillance canbe recognised. What can a simple rubbish bin on wheels have to do with theagenda for global control? What could be more innocent than putting out thetrash? Answer one: plenty, it seems. Answer two: the age of innocence is overuntil we have removed the soulless ones who are leading us, pipes-a-playing,into the Orwellian nightmare. It has emerged that half a million British wheeliebins have been microchipped, mostly by German-based companies, with the rest ofthe country destined to follow. Similar systems are at work throughout Europe.Yep, microchipping has now reached the trash can and it is being dubbed ‘chipand bin’ after the credit card ‘chip and pin’ system in the UK. The microchipstransmit information from the bin to a central database with the potential tokeep a record of what rubbish each householder throws out. Even the garbage isno longer private. None of this was stated publicly to allow some kind of debateto ensue. It was done without telling anyone and only found its way into themedia when a council official mentioned the chips at a Rotary Club dinner. Ifthey are even secretly bugging your bin, what the hell else is the Hidden Handdoing without our knowledge? The London Mail on Sunday described how bin-buggingworks:> With the bugging technology, the electronic chips are carefully hidden under> the moulded front ‘lip’ of wheelie bins used by householders for> non-recyclable waste. As the bin is raised by the mechanical hoister at the> back of the truck, the chip passes across an antenna fitted to the lifting> mechanism. That enables the antenna to ‘read’ a serial number assigned to each> property in the street. > A computer inside the truck weighs the bin as it is raised, subtracts the> weight of the bin itself and records the weight of the contents on an> electronic data card. When the truck returns to the depot, all the information> collected on the round is transmitted to a hand-held device and downloaded on> to the council’s centralised computer. Each household can be billed for the> amount of waste collected – even though they have already paid for the> services through their council tax. The official justification for bin-bugging is to ‘improve efficiency’ and, getthis, to settle disputes between neighbours about the ownership of wheelie bins.Martin Smith, head of Environmental Services at Kennet District Council, said:> These are simply chips that will enable us to sort out disputes between> householders about whose wheelie bin is whose. If there are any arguments we> can just send out an officer to scan the chip and settle the argument. There> is a debate in Government over the possibility of introducing charges, but> that’s not what we had in mind when we ordered the chips. Garbage. They are planning to spend £2 to bug every wheelie bin in Britain, and£15,000 to fit the technology to every waste truck, just to decide arguments onwho owns a wheelie bin?? Oh please. They also talk about the need to recyclewaste more efficiently, but this, too, is, well, rubbish. The real reason iscontrol. Some waste disposal specialists say the idea is to gather theinformation to fine people for not putting the right waste in the right bin and,stands back in amazement, the British government is preparing to give councilsnew powers in this regard. Steve Foster, sales director of PM OnBoard, whichfits weighing equipment to waste disposal trucks, said his company already had afull database of names and addresses and they were ready to introduce new feesfor rubbish collection as soon as the law allows. But still the true reason isbeyond even that.Programmed acquiescenceThe mass of surveillance in all areas of our lives needs to be seen as a whole,not just as individual parts. The bin-bugging is significant in the way ithighlights how Big Brother is infiltrating the fine detail of our lives, but itis even more important when viewed with all the other gathering intrusions. Walkacross towns and cities today and you pass from camera to camera recording yourevery movement. Go into a store or an ATM and the same happens. When yourchildren go to school they are increasingly watched by cameras, preparing thenext generation to accept this intrusion as a normal part of life. Trafficcameras check your speed and a few miles an hour over the limit, no matter whatthe circumstances (unless you are a police officer) means an instant fine in theUK. The satellite network can already photograph your licence plate from spaceand all new cars will have to carry chips that connect them to satellites totrack the details of your every journey. They are also preparing for thesatellite system to connect with the human microchips planned to be introducedas soon as the public has been programmed enough by the ‘war on terror’. Whenyou work at the computer or use the phone you are being recorded by a systemsearching for key words or, if you are on their watch-list, every word. Aglimpse at the scale of phone tapping in the United States has more recentlycome to light, but the true and enormous extent of Internet tracking, emailsurveillance and web surfing is not publicly known. Add to the technologicalsurveillance the ever-increasing schemes, even laws in some cases, encouragingand pressuring people to snoop on their neighbours or clients and report theirfindings to the authorities. These include percentages being offered to snoopersof any assets seized in a subsequent prosecution. The sum total of all this, andso much more, is to turn people into a bar-coded ‘commodity’, tracked andrecorded every day of their lives and even watched by neighbours and workcolleagues. What you say, where you go, what you buy, what you eat, what youdrink, even what you throw in the rubbish bin, are all being downloaded intovast databases. Privacy? How do you spell that again, it’s one of those oldwords my mother talked about, isn’t it?The idea is to make surveillance and control so much a feature of life that weacquiesce to its dictates even without being forced to by a uniform or darksuit. The real goal of all this is to make people so servile and robotic thatthe cattle prods in their now endless forms become unnecessary. Unquestioningcompliance alone will keep the sheep in the pen. The principle they are using isthe same as that used on laboratory mice or rats. You keep shocking them whenthey take a route in the maze you don’t want, and, in the end, they avoid thoseroutes even without being shocked. This is where the true significance of thewheelie bin bugging can be appreciated. Think of all the times every day you aretold what to do, either directly or by a sign of some kind. Think of all thetimes you are aware of the consequences of not complying with authority, likealways watching for traffic cameras in case you go slightly over the limit.Imagine how driving will be when your speed and location is constantly trackedfrom space wherever you are. Think of how many times you watch what you saybecause it might upset some authority or breach the ludicrous limits set byPolitical Correctness. Now, they want us to be aware of the consequences fromauthority if you don’t throw out the rubbish in the ‘right’ way. What all thisdoes, and there are endless more examples in daily experience, is to make peopleconsciously and subconsciously aware of authority and fear not doing as they aretold. As this happens more and more often in ever greater areas of our lives,there comes a point, different for each person, where they reach the stage ofunquestioning, unthinking, acquiescence. They no longer need a ‘shock’, in otherwords. What they are doing here is programming the computer. That’s the goal –to close down our conscious connection with Infinite Awareness, and download tothe computer level of reality the programs that suit their agenda for masscontrol. In 1932, Aldous Huxley wrote in the way-ahead-of-its-time, Brave NewWorld, that the infiltration of the mind by the state would continue throughsuggestion until …> … at last the child’s mind is these suggestions, and the sum of the> suggestions is the child’s mind. And not the child’s mind only. The adult’s> mind too – all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides –> made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are our suggestions …> Suggestions from the State (my emphasis). The game is to subjugate the human mind to follow a pattern of response everybit as extreme as the laboratory rat walking round the maze without needingexternal intervention about which way to go. Unthinking acquiescence sums upthis state of ‘mind’ – the comfort zone where conformity = comfort. An Internetarticle I saw put it all very well:> The reconstruction of your consciousness into this automaton thing is being> executed in such a manner that it goes virtually undetected; in fact you are> doing it to yourself and don’t even know it.

The Orwell generationChildren and young people are being targeted as a priority. To this end, theBritish Home Office is even fingerprinting under-fives, and may include babies,in its biometrics ID scheme ‘trial’. A spokesrobot said that fingerprinting wasan established biometric technology and there was no minimum age for its use. Weare seeing surveillance cameras in schools across the world. Some have fifty andmore all over the school, even in toilets, and the big sell as usual isprotecting the children after violent events in schools and colleges inArkansas, Colorado, California, Kentucky, Virginia, Mississippi and otherstates, and in places like Dunblane in Scotland. Problem-Reaction-Solution. Onemedia report about a school in Michigan said:> At the far ends of the new Whitmore Lake High School, stairwells stretching> three stories high are normally outside of staff members’ view. Their wide> open spaces are inviting targets for kids wanting to be kids. But, thanks to> three security cameras mounted high on the wall, Principal Tom DeKeyser> doesn’t worry about shenanigans going on outside of his sight. I think it would be more appropriate to worry about Principal Tom DeKeyser andhis kind across the world. What a step forward for humanity – three securitycameras to stop ‘kids being kids’. But, that’s the whole point of it for thoseoperating way beyond DeKeyser’s powers of comprehension. It is sobering to thinkthat those of us born before the mass surveillance began are the lastgenerations who have the experience to compare what it was like with what it isbecoming. Today’s children will not be able to make that comparison and that’scrucial to the manipulators. When we come into this world we see the way itlooks and works to be ‘the way life is’. We’ve never known anything else so thisis how things must be. As the world changes through our lives, we have acoordinate – how it used to be – to observe the change and if we don’t like itwe can make our feelings known. The pandemic of freedom-busting today is a greatexample of this. However, when the schools and streets are peppered withcameras, children have their fingerprints taken to access school meals andsurveillance is everywhere, the new-borns are coming into the world ‘as it is’.To them, it will be ‘normal’ – all they have known. That makes those with a fewdecades behind us, the ones with their eyes open anyway, the last generationswho will be able to see what is happening so blatantly, and it presents us withenormous responsibility. We are seeing ever-younger children targeted by theboneheads in uniform to instil fear of authority from an early age. AnAssociated Press report revealed that a five-year-old boy had been charged inAmerica with sexual harassment:> Washington County school officials told Charles Vallance that his son pinched> a girl’s buttocks earlier this month in a hallway at Lincolnshire Elementary> School. The school says that meets the state’s definition of sexual> harassment. It doesn’t meet my definition of intelligence, however. The ‘offence’ willremain on the child’s file and there are endless more examples, gathering paceby the week, of this brain-numbing nonsense – but nonsense with a calculatedmotive. Twenty-eight kindergarten students were suspended for sex offences inone school year – fifteen for sexual harassment. Another student was handcuffedfor writing on her desk and here are some other relevant headlines listed atPrisonplanet.com [http://Prisonplanet.com]: Handcuffing Of 5-Year-Old: A PicturePostcard Of America’s Decline; School Suspends Kindergartner For Bringing PocketKnife To Lunch; Skateboarding Children Arrested in Massachusetts; Child arrestedfor bringing a toy to school; Officer’s Taser [electronic gun] is used on girl,9; Student’s refusal to adjust cap leads to arrest; 9-year-old arrested forstealing bunny; Boy investigated by FBI for researching paper on Chesapeake BayBridge; Secret Service Questions Students. These are just a few examples of thewar on our children to produce the chipped conformers of the Orwellian world.One fifth-grader said he had been sent home for visiting websites questioningthe official story of 9/11 and at other schools, like Lee Middle in Wyoming,Michigan, they have ‘drills’ in which armed police officers burst into the roompointing their guns at the students’ heads. The students are given no warning.‘Some kids were so scared that they wet their pants’, one mother said. Only sickminds would even contemplate such an outrage. The Reptilian hybrids want controlof all children, what they are taught, what they think, how they live and wherethey live. It was revealed in Britain in 2007 that babies were being removedfrom their parents by councils to meet their targets for adoptions and thechildren were taken into ‘care’ unnecessarily so they could be given adoptiveparents. Talk about sheer evil, but the Reptilian hybrids have no empathy, noemotional connection to the children or their distraught parents. The BritishLiberal Democrat MP John Hemming said it was a ‘national scandal’ and it is, butone coldly created by the government demanding a 50 per cent increase in thenumbers of children adopted. The aim is to destroy the family unit to makeeveryone a child of the global state. Parental rights are being eroded for thesame reason and one idiot Republican in Texas even wants parents to be fined$500 and have a criminal record for not attending a scheduled meeting with ateacher. Already the choice to have your child vaccinated in the United Stateshas all but been taken from the parents and they want the same everywhere.What children and students think and believe is being ever more closelymonitored and their teachers targeted if they allow free debate in the classroomthat doesn’t suit the system. Class debates about Israel are condemned by theB’nai B’rith/ADL crowd as ‘forums for hatred’, just as they try to stop evenJewish people having a public platform to criticise Israel, and blocked thestage production in New York of a play about Rachel Corrie, a campaigner forPalestinian justice, killed by an Israeli bulldozer. A social work student atMissouri State University filed a lawsuit alleging the school insisted shesupported homosexual adoption as a precondition to getting her degree. Herattorney, David French, described it as ‘really an amazing case’. He says hisclient was ‘punished, forced to undergo close monitoring for the rest of hercareer at the university, and forced to write things that she disagreed with, inorder to graduate’. He adds that many public universities are demanding thatstudents adopt ‘leftist’ positions to get a social work degree. In othersubjects they are pressured to take ‘rightish’ positions, like support for thewar on terrorism and not questioning the official version of 9/11. As I haveoutlined in other books, there is an increasing use of drugs such as Ritalin onschoolchildren who don’t conform, and they are said to have ‘psychiatricproblems’ – just as they said about dissidents in the Soviet Union to justifytheir detention in the mental institutions. The Boy Bush administrationintroduced mental assessments of all children and the British government istrying to introduce the enforced detention of those deemed to be mentally illeven when they have not committed a crime. These are all being put in place toremove opponents of the fascist state together with the concentration camps, or‘holding centres’, that are already in place and waiting.What I have outlined in this chapter is just a fraction of what is happeningevery day to install the fully-fledged Orwellian state, and who, in their rightmind, or any mind, can now doubt that the world he described is now here? Howlong it stays, and how much more extreme it becomes, is down to us."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 19 Fake ‘democracy’ > Tyranny is always better organised than freedom. > Charles Peguy We don’t have Congressional or Parliamentary government any longer. Themuch-lauded system called ‘democracy’ has always been the imposition of the manyover the few, and has never been the ‘freedom’ it is claimed to be. But, now, wehave gone even further. ‘Free societies’ have become dictatorships by the veryfew over all the rest.If you were asked to sign a document without reading it you would be immediatelysuspicious of the guy with the pen in his hand. You would insist on reading thecontent before you put your name to it and make a commitment to support what itsaid. You would, therefore, from the system’s point of view, make a really badCongressman or Member of Parliament. Their job is to vote for reams and reams oflegislation that fundamentally affects the lives of everyone without evenreading it. Not here and there, now and then, but every day. It’s called‘democracy’, apparently. Congressman Ron Paul from Texas told The WashingtonTimes that no member of Congress was allowed to read the first Patriot Actpassed on October 27th 2001 in the wake of 9/11. Yet, this Act dramaticallyincreased the power of the Executive and removed a host of basic freedoms frompeople. No matter. The voting fodder on Capitol Hill still agreed to support itwithout even knowing what it said. These are your representatives, ladies andgentlemen. Brains and backbones do not a politician make. The Maastricht Treatythat handed over massive powers from Britain to Brussels and the European Unionin 1992 was another major Bill not read by most of the people who voted it intolaw. A government minister at the time, Kenneth Clarke (Bilderberg Group), evenadmitted in a BBC interview that he hadn’t read the Bill while going aroundsupporting it. This is happening in a period of human history when it is vitalto study every word and nuance of proposed legislation, because what we areseeing is no less than the covert introduction of the fascist state in countryafter country. Indeed, to anyone who does bother to track such matters, it isnow often not even covert much of the time.The British government’s ‘Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill’ is anoutstanding example of the way the Big Brother state is moving. Behind itsboring title lay the power for the government to make a vast array of lawswithout any vote in Parliament. Cambridge Law Professor, John Spencer, called itthe ‘Abolition of Parliament Bill’. It proposed to give the government the powerto detain people for years, impose house arrest, and give the police expandedpowers of arrest and interrogation, all without a parliamentary debate. The Billallowed for new courts and changes in the law on immigration, nationality,divorce, inheritance and the appointment of judges, once again without anydecision of an elected parliament. Even for those who do bother to read thiscovert dynamite will find themselves in a maze of civil servant-speak calculatedto confuse and mislead. This is one of the ways they hide what it all reallymeans. This is an example of the technique taken from this ‘reform’ Bill:> Subsections (4) and (5) are transitional provisions. They deal with> consultation which has taken place before the date on which these clauses come> into force. If any consultation is undertaken before subsection (4) comes into> force, and that consultation would to any extent satisfy any of the> requirements of clause 11 (if the consultation had taken place after it comes> into force), those requirements are, to that extent, taken to have been> satisfied. It is not necessary therefore to repeat the consultation.> Subsection (5) applies specifically where the power in the 2001 Act has been> repealed at the time an order is to be made. In those circumstances, where> proposals for an order under clause 1 of this Bill are the same as proposals> for an order under section 1 of the 2001 Act and those proposals have been> consulted upon under that Act, then consultation will be taken to have been> satisfied for the purposes of this clause (even where the proposals have been> varied following consultation under the 2001 Act and it was appropriate that> no further consultation be undertaken). This means that such proposals do not> need to be consulted on again where an order was going to be made under the> 2001 Act but is now going to be made under clause 1 of this Bill. This is straight from the Reptilian mind. The trick is to hide major legislativechanges within mind-numbing gobbledegook like this, and it’s a method ofmanipulation used all over the world by the Reptilian hybrids. A report in theLondon Times by Daniel Finkelstein, headed ‘How I woke up to a nightmare plot tosteal centuries of law and liberty’, captures the true meaning of this fascistBill:> Now I know what I am about to tell you is difficult to believe (Why isn’t this> on the front pages? Where’s the big political row?), but I promise you that it> is true. The extraordinary Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, currently> before the House, gives ministers power to amend, repeal or replace any> legislation simply by making an order and without having to bring a Bill> before Parliament. The House of Lords Constitution Committee says the Bill is> ‘of first-class constitutional significance’ and fears that it could ‘markedly> alter the respective and long standing roles of minister and Parliament in the> legislative process’. Put simply, it is the end of Parliament, just as, in the United States, we haveeffectively had the end of Congress since 9/11. When there is no elected bodythat represents the peoples’ freedoms and interests, you are left with adictatorship. And we have been – if we allow it. The ‘Reform’ Bill says thingslike the government can only impose a burden ‘proportionate to the benefitexpected to be gained’, but who decides what is ‘proportionate’? The government.What they are saying is ‘trust us’ with ultimate power because we will never useit against the wrong people. This is the same government that passed laws to‘stop terrorists’ while ensuring in the wording that it could apply to anyonethey choose to target, including little old ladies with a banner protestingagainst mass slaughter. This is the same government that introduced ‘antiterror’ laws and then used them against peaceful protestors such as Maya Evanswho was arrested under Section 132 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Actfor simply standing at the Cenotaph war memorial in London and reading out thenames of British soldiers killed in Iraq. One opposition Member of Parliamentsaid of the law used in the case: ‘[It] was sold to us on the basis that it wasto prevent terrorist acts against this House and has now been used to convict ayoung lady, Maya Evans, for reading out a list of British soldiers killed inaction in Iraq by the Cenotaph’. Wake up, mate, that’s how it was always meantto be used. The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which gives thegovernment sweeping powers to make law outside of the parliamentary process, wassold as just a means of improving administrative efficiency. The governmentclaimed that the Bill was needed to speed up the passage of legislation intolaw. If ministers can just decide to change the law whenever they like, think ofall the debating time that would be saved, the ‘argument’ goes. As DanielFinkelstein wrote in his Times article:> What does this argument, used often by the minister during last week’s debate,> amount to? An admission that we are now passing so many new laws, so quickly,> and so many of them are sloppy, that we don’t have time to debate them> properly or reform them when they go wrong. Parliament is drowning in a sea of> legislation. Instead of calling a halt to this, the Government is seeking a> way of moving ever faster, adding yet more laws, this time with even less> debate. Law by dictateThis tidal wave of law is the global dictatorship being constructed and so it ishappening everywhere. They are voting away checks, balances and freedoms untilonly centralised dictatorship remains. The Reptilian hybrids are in a frenzy toimpose their global prison by stealth before enough people realise what is goingon. Stifling real debate on the issues by cutting or removing such debating timeis crucial to introducing fascist legislation with a speed that makes it lawbefore most people have even heard it has been proposed. Another major route forthese impositions is what is known in Britain as ‘secondary legislation’. Again,it’s a tedious title with a fuse fitted and a timing device going tick, tick,tick. Beware the boring and banal, it’s often a nuclear weapon disguised as acarrot cake. As I have been saying for years, most people don’t have opinionsbased on detailed knowledge or understanding; they have an ‘image’ of what thesituation is. This image comes from hearing, mostly half-hearing, mantraschanted incessantly by politicians, ‘journalists’ and academics. They get the‘impression’ that for something to become law it has to be subject to debate byelected people in national parliaments or local councils. Not so. Thousands ofnew laws are passed every year without any such debate. This is secondarylegislation, also known as subordinate or delegated legislation and, in the caseof government ministers, ‘Statutory Instruments’. This is a definition fromwww.answers.com [http://www.answers.com]:> Statutory Instruments (SIs) are parts of United Kingdom law separate from Acts> of Parliament which do not require full Parliamentary approval before becoming> law. These are usually brought to Parliament by a Government minister,> exercising legislative powers delegated to them by an Act of Parliament. The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which was passed in 2006 in only aslightly watered-down version, is designed to bring virtually all law making andlaw changing under the heading of secondary or delegated legislation – delegatedto the government. It will be the no-debate dictatorship. You won’t be surprisedto know that the powers to make laws through secondary legislation without openand democratic debate soared after the Reptilian hybrid, Tony Blair, came topower. They are imposed, often even without public knowledge, through what arecalled ministerial regulations, orders in council, and codes of practice, aswell as Statutory Instruments. Several thousand of these laws are passed eachyear compared to only a few dozen Acts of Parliament. In 2007, it was revealedthat in the ten years of Tony Blair alone thirty thousand new laws wereintroduced. That’s an average of a new law every three hours. What’s more, 98per cent of them were introduced without proper debate through StatutoryInstruments.In the United States, the system known as ‘rulemaking’ is similar in many ways.Laws passed, at least in theory, on Capitol Hill are given further added detailby the rulemaking agencies often packed with, or advised by, unelected andunknown scientific, economic and corporate ‘experts’. It is another way ofintroducing legislative changes without political debate. Then, there are thePresidential Executive Orders that bypass Congress and have been used to build amountain of laws and laws-in-waiting that are nothing less than a fascist statesitting in the shadows until they are activated by a ‘state of emergency’. Asformer Bill Clinton advisor, Paul Begala, said in The New York Times in 1998:‘Stroke of the pen. Law of the Land. Kinda cool’. Executive Orders are legallybinding orders issued by the President without public debate. They don’t requireCongressional approval, yet have the same legal weight as laws passed byCongress. There is nothing in the United States Constitution or statute thatpermits this, except for the vague ‘executive power’ given in Article II,Section 1 of the Constitution, and the statement ‘take care that the laws befaithfully executed’ in Article II, Section 3. If Congress passes a Bill tochallenge laws made by Executive Order the President has the power of veto. Tooverride this veto takes a two-thirds majority – highly unlikely to say theleast. The way the United States form of government was set up gives fantasticpower to one man and, more to the point, to those who control him.It was through Executive Order 9066 that President Franklin Roosevelt gave powerto the military to remove people to a military zone. This was used to imprisonJapanese and German-Americans in ‘internment camps’, which takes on particularrelevance when you think that such camps are being located across America todaywith the involvement of Cheney’s Halliburton Corporation. Bush has usedExecutive Orders to restrict civil liberties, intellectual freedom and freedomof information. One of his first acts was to introduce Executive order 13233 torestrict access to the official records of presidents – thus protecting hisfather from public exposure for his horrific behaviour during his presidency andthat of Ronald Reagan. A document made public by the American Civil LibertiesUnion claims that Boy Bush issued an Executive Order authorising the inhumaneinterrogation of detainees in Iraq. A two-page FBI email references an ExecutiveOrder in which the President directly authorised interrogation techniques like‘sleep deprivation, stress positions, use of military dogs and sensorydeprivation through the use of hoods, etc’. The Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA) is a 100 per cent-controlled Reptilian hybrid operation. It wascreated by an Executive Order and only six per cent of its budget is spent onpreparing for emergencies. All this happened without any public debate oragreement by the supposedly elected representatives of the people. You can seethat most law is introduced without public debate. Multi-millions of laws areimposed around the world through ‘secondary legislation’ in all its forms, andother scams that bypass debate. Look at the powers that these undebatedExecutive Orders have given to the government and its agencies:> •Executive Order 10990 allows the government to take over all transportation> and control of roads and ports.> •Executive Order 10995 allows the government to take over all media and forms> of communication.> •Executive Order 10997 allows the government to control all forms of power,> fuel and minerals.> •Executive Order 10998 allows the seizure of all farms and food production.> •Executive Order 10999 allows the government to take over all transportation,> private as well as public, including your car.> •Executive Order 11000 gives the government power to control all citizens and> force them to work where and when instructed. This includes the right to split> families.> •Executive Order 11001 allows all health, education and welfare services to> come under government control.> •Executive Order 11002 gives the postmaster the right to register all men,> women and children in the United States.> •Executive Order 11003 gives the government control of all airports and> aircraft.> •Executive Order 11004 allows the government to seize all housing and finance> and force people to leave what are declared to be ‘Forced Relocation> Designated Areas’.> •Executive Order 11005 gives the government control of all railways, waterways> and storage facilities.> •Executive Order 11051 outlines the role of the Office of Emergency Planning> and gives the right to activate all Executive Orders into effect in times of> ‘increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis’.> •Executive Order 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to> develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and> distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money> in US financial institutions in any undefined national emergency. It also> provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress> cannot review the action for six months.> •Executive Order 12919 was signed by President Clinton on June 3rd, 1994, to> bring all of the above under one order.There they sit, just waiting for a ‘crisis’ to activate them, and the ‘crisis’will be caused by the same force that manipulated them into law. In May 2007,further legislation was imposed to allow the President to take complete controlof the country in the wake of a ‘catastrophic event’. It would make him afully-fledged dictator. The National Security and Homeland Security PresidentialDirective apparently overrides the National Emergency Act and removes theauthority of Congress to ‘modify, rescind, or render dormant’ the President’semergency powers. Here we are on the brink of the world that Orwell foresaw. Aworld in which the right to habeas corpus to challenge unlawful imprisonment bythe state is being eroded and, for many, destroyed; where people can be kept foryears at the grotesque Guantanamo Bay without charge or trial and under housearrest in the UK without any evidence being produced against them; where a judgetells an army officer that he cannot refuse to serve in an illegal war; whereyou can have your car confiscated for using a mobile phone or not wearing aseatbelt; where a teenager can be fined £50 for throwing a chip for a seagull,and people can be fined for feeding the birds while out on a walk; whereelections are rigged by electronic voting machines with no paper trail and theworkings of the technology cannot be seen because it is protected by copyright;where we have Orwellian ‘Free Speech Zones’ that impound peaceful protestorsaway from the source of their protest. We are told that we need all thissurveillance and control to ‘fight crime’ and ‘fight terrorism’. Reptilianhybrids want to ‘fight’ everything and they create the circumstances that causethe crime that they can then ‘fight’. Apart from the few who are criminal byprogrammed nature, these are some of the major causes of the crime we are toldwe must ‘fight’: > 1) Violence and theft to feed a drug addiction.> Who controls the drug trafficking networks? The very people who say we need> more surveillance and control to ‘fight crime’.> > 2) Violence and theft by those with no job and, they believe, no hope – the> people who attack the system by, irony of ironies, and stupidity of> stupidities, violence and theft against other victims of the system in their> neighbourhood.> Who has made the system so soulless, divisive and unjust? The very people who> say we need more surveillance and control to ‘fight crime’.> > 3) Violence and theft due to greed, and to steal the latest clothes, car or> gadget that they don’t have the money to buy.> Who sells the myth that success can be judged by possessions and who has> encouraged human greed? The very people who say we need more surveillance and> control to ‘fight crime’.> > 4) Who are the planet’s biggest criminals?> The very people who say we need more surveillance and control to ‘fight> crime’.Look at all the causes of crime and you will find that the overwhelming majoritywill be linked to upbringing and experience connected to the structure ofsociety and manipulation of the Reptilian hybrids. Who is the main force behindglobal terrorism, indeed the people who orchestrate the vast majority of it? Thevery people who say we need more surveillance and control to ‘fight terrorism’.It’s all one gigantic Problem- Reaction-Solution.‘Law-enforcement’ elitismThose who control the police and other law enforcement agencies are delightedwith the way the world is going. It gives them more power, and you get idioticstatements like this one from Graham Gerrard from the Association of ChiefPolice Officers: ‘… Any police surveillance that is unseen is, in fact,controlled and has to be proportionate otherwise it would never get authorised’.What utter drivel. The law enforcement agencies are virtually a law untothemselves, and whenever you have a situation in which those in uniform andauthority are not subject to the same laws as the rest of the population you arelooking at fascism. When I went to see the war protestor, Brian Haw, outside theHouses of Parliament in London I had a policeman with a camera inches from myface for some ten minutes. When I went back to the same spot two weeks laterwith a television crew and started filming the police, they were putting theirhands over the lens and ordering us to stop which, of course, we didn’t. One lawfor us, one for them – fascism. British drivers who are caught on trafficcameras going a few miles an hour over the limit are being fined and prosecuted,while a police officer caught doing 128 miles an hour on a public road was letoff because he was ‘testing the car’. It is no coincidence that the arrogance oflaw enforcement officers has increased at the same rate as their powers, butthey should understand that they have no power at all. It is their uniform thathas the power. The uniform is the representative of the power structure – thepeople inside are merely the ‘heavy’ for hire. Without the uniform, they have nopower. What they seem to miss is that their children and grandchildren are goingto have to live in the Orwellian world that they are helping to impose. Youstill find decent, sensible police officers who don’t like what is happening,but they are getting rarer. The system doesn’t want its enforcers to be likethat, it wants people like the ‘community police officer’ in my town who strutsaround like a John Wayne wannabe.Despite all the evidence that the Orwellian state is here, programmed people canstill be numbered in billions. A news story in 2007 reported that a hugemajority of British people said in a poll that curbs on civil liberty were a‘price worth paying’ to ‘fight terror’. Seven out of every ten people thoughtthat compulsory identity cards for all adults would be justified to reduce thethreat of terrorism, and eight in ten said the authorities should be able to tapthe phones of suspected terrorists, open their mail and impose electronictagging or home curfews. The Internet response of a guy called Mark Jones to oneof the attacks on freedom was typical of what you hear: ‘If it prevents criminalbehaviour or improves its detection I’m all for it.’ You have to be careful withopinion polls because they are often rigged to get the required result, and itis a fact that many people are influenced in their own ‘opinions’ by the viewsthat dominate the polls. What is not in doubt is that large numbers are stillfast asleep and can’t see what is going on around them. As Oscar Wilde sobrilliantly said: ‘To disagree with three-fourths of the British public is oneof the first requisites of sanity’. It’s a theme that seems to work anywhere.Even ‘civil liberties’ groups have understated the situation we face andcertainly have not understood the force behind it all.We can’t rely on the media to help us to secure our freedoms or civil libertiesgroups and certainly not the authorities who are controlled by the mentalityarticulated by the so aptly-named American politician, ‘Newt’ Gingrinch. Hesaid: ‘The threat of biological or nuclear attack requires America to considercurbs to speech to fight terrorists, if it is to protect the society that makesthe First Amendment [free speech] possible’. I know, and he still remembers tobreathe. Amazing. We need to give away our freedoms to protect our freedoms – anextraordinary piece of doublethink even by his standards (Figure 205). Ifanything is going to change it is down to us. I will talk later about this, buthow do we avoid such programmed conformity? Simple: we don’t conform and wedon’t pressure others to do so – our children, friends or workmates. Wecelebrate diversity of thought and lifestyle instead of condemning it. Nor, dowe accept the impositions of the State, like microchipped people or wheeliebins, or whatever. Tom Seaman, a Wiltshire farmer, urged residents to protest atthe wheelie bin scam by unscrewing the bugs from the bins and sending them backto the council.

The policywould be unenforceable and it would have to stop. When enough people refused topay Margaret Thatcher’s deeply unfair ‘Poll Tax’ in the late 1980s, thegovernment had to throw it out. WE have the power, but only if we choose to useit. The creeping, step-by-step suffocation of our freedom through theTotalitarian Tiptoe will only be stopped when we decide to stop it – when westand for what is right instead of jeering from across the street while notactually getting involved in action. It really is choice time. We can sit andmoan or we can stand and deliver. We can take our freedom back from the fascistsor we can follow the piper with scales and a tail. Hardly a choice is it?What we need to remember is that Big Brother is actually a little wimp. Hedepends for his power on our acquiescence and the way we allow our collectivepower to be divided and diluted by religion, race, income bracket and otherirrelevant squabbles and fault lines.

What we now call ‘countries’ would be broken up intopowerless ‘regions’ under the strict control of the superstates, and they wouldall answer to the world government (Figure 206). There would be a world army toimpose the will of the world government, a world central bank and world currency(electronic not cash), and this structure would control a microchippedpopulation. All this is happening before our eyes and it has been planned a verylong time. The idea is not only for direct control, but also control throughdependency. When you bring down ‘trade barriers’, it means that a country can nolonger defend its own economy and becomes dependent on the global economic andtrade system that the Reptilian hybrids control. I am going to reveal thebackground to the creation and manipulation of the European Union with regard toall of this, because that will show those in other parts of the world how theirparticular superstate is being covertly introduced today while no one tellsthem. The European Union was the blueprint and if a technique works, why changeit?Image [../Images/00215.jpg]Figure 206: The structure of the global tyranny. Look around, it’s beinginstalled by the day Image [../Images/00216.jpg]Figure 207: The Babylonian symbolism on the flag of the European Union Image [../Images/00217.jpg]Figure 208: The twelve stars around the head of the goddess, Isis (Semiramis),that inspired the flag of the European Union Europa’s EmpireThe European superstate was started by something called the Treaty of Rome, andthis not a coincidence. The European Union is another version of the RomanEmpire and the EU flag is symbolic of the mother goddess of Babylon yet again –Semiramis in all her many names and guises (Figure 207). The twelve stars, orpentagrams, of the Babylonian Zodiac represent the goddess, and the Roman Churchthus claims that Mother Mary, as the ‘Queen of Heaven’, has a ‘crown of twelvestars’. The Book of Revelation 12:1, says: ‘Then a great pageant appeared inheaven, portraying things to come. I saw a woman clothed with the sun, with themoon beneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head’ (Figure 208).The circle is also a Mystery School symbol for the Babylonian virgin-born son,Tammuz. The symbol for the EU flag is attributed to a Belgian Jew(Khazar/Sumerian) called Paul Levi, a converted Roman Catholic who was directorof the ‘cultural section’ of the European Council, established in London in1949. During discussions about the European flag, it is claimed, Levi waspassing a statue of ‘Mother Maria’, which had a ‘star coronet’ shining under ablue sky. Levi is said to have immediately called the Secretary General of theCouncil of Europe, Earl Benvenuti, a Venice count, and told him that twelvegolden stars in a chain against a dark blue background should be the Europeanflag. They love their cover stories don’t they? It represents Queen Semiramis inother words. The very name ‘Europe’ comes from the goddess Europa, anotherSemiramis alias. The European Union is the Europa Union, the union of theBabylonian goddess.Image [../Images/00218.jpg]Figure 209: The goddess Europa (Semiramis) was depicted by the ancients with thebull (Nimrod) The European flag was introduced on December 8th 1955, which was the feast ofThe Immaculate Conception of Mary, and, on September 2nd 1958, the Archbishop ofMilan, the future Pope Pius XII, unveiled a twenty metre-high statue of Mary andcalled it ‘Our beloved Lady, Ruler of Europe’. In 1984, two stamps were issuedfor the European elections in Britain and one depicted a woman riding a beast orbull led by a winged boy over seven hills or waves in the sea. This was thelegend of the goddess Europa (Semiramis), whom Jupiter (Nimrod) led away in theform of a bull (Figure 209). The bull is one of the Mystery school symbols forNimrod. The god Jupiter was also symbolized by the winged boy and is associatedwith Bacchus, another name for Tammuz/Nimrod/Jesus. The other stamp designincluded a bridge with the word ‘Europa’. The Latin word ‘Pontifex’, meaning‘Pontiff’ or ‘High Priest’, comes from the Latin words ‘pons’, meaning bridge,and ‘facio’, meaning make, and so Pontifex means ‘Bridge-Maker’. The RomanChurch and its Pontifex are often symbolised as a bridge in occult imagery, aswith the Pont de l’Alma bridge and tunnel in Paris where Diana was killed. As Imentioned earlier, Pont de l’Alma translates as Bridge or Passage of the MoonGoddess. The Europa and bull, Semiramis and Nimrod, image can be seen on aEuropean Union commemorative coin issued in 2005 (Figure 210).Image [../Images/00219.jpg]Figure 210: Europa and the bull appear on this commemorative coin issued by theEuropean Union Further confirmation of the Church of Rome connection comes from Otto vonHabsburg, the head of the dynasty, who is the current leader of the Pan EuropeanMovement (Figure 211, overleaf). The Habsburgs are a thoroughbred Reptilianhybrid bloodline who have dominated the Reptilian stronghold of Alsace-Lorraineand basically ruled much of Europe for centuries. They held the title of HolyRoman Emperor and produced Emperors of Austria, Dukes of Austria, Kings ofGermany, Kings of Hungary, Kings of Spain, Kings of Portugal, Kings of Bohemia,Grand Dukes of Tuscany and even an Emperor of Mexico. Otto von Habsburg was bornin 1912 with the title Archduke Franz Joseph Otto Robert Maria Anton Karl MaxHeinrich Sixtus Xaver Felix Renatus Ludwig Gaetan Pius Ignatius of Austria. Hewas the eldest son of Karl of Austria, the last Emperor of Austria and last Kingof Hungary. Habsburg lives in Bavaria in Germany, and like so many of theReptilian hybrids he has lived well into his 90s. He has made it clear that hewants a Roman Catholic Europe and a European head of state elected for life –just like the leader of the Jesuits. Habsburg said of the European star circlelogo in his book, The Social Order of Tomorrow:> Now we do possess a European symbol which belongs to all nations equally. This> is the crown of the Holy Roman Empire, which embodies the tradition of> Charlemagne, the ruler of the united occident [countries of Europe and the> western hemisphere]. Image [../Images/00220.jpg]Figure 211: The flag of the Pan European (Europa) Movement – the Babylonianstars, the Sun god and the red cross of the Knights Templar That is what this is all about – the bloodline of Charlemagne and the Reptilianhybrid agenda for global control. A Charlemagne prize was established for thosewho work hardest for ‘European unity’ and one recipient was the Jesuit-trainedPresident Bill Clinton, who called for the European Union to encompass Russia.‘Just a free trade area’The plan for a United States of Europe under centralised control goes backcenturies and it was one of the goals of the Knights Templar, among others.Three of the men behind the European Economic Community (or ‘Common Market’),now the European Union, were: Jean Monnet, the son of a French brandy merchantand known as the ‘Father of Europe’; Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi fromAustria; and Joseph Retinger, a Polish ‘socialist’ who formed an organisationcalled the European Movement to press for central control of Europe. Retingerwas also extremely influential in the creation of the Bilderberg Group, andGeorge McGhee, a US ambassador to West Germany and Bilderberg attendee, latersaid: ‘The Treaty of Rome, which brought the Common Market into being, wasnurtured at Bilderberg meetings’. It was Retinger and long-time Bilderberg Groupchairman, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who suggested regular meetings ofEuropean foreign ministers. Out of these meetings came the customs union knownas the Benelux Countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxemburg), a forerunner tothe European Community. Retinger was supported by Illuminati manipulator AverellHarriman, then US Ambassador to Britain, who introduced him to all the classicnames connected to the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and the Council on ForeignRelations, that go on recurring through this story.Jean Monnet was working in tandem with Retinger. Monnet left France for Canadain 1910, at the age of just twenty, to seek new markets for the family brandybusiness. There, he linked up with the Hudson Bay Company and the LazardBrothers banking operation and became part of the Anglo-American scene, eventhough he was French. He became a confidant to presidents and prime ministersand this won him a highly-lucrative contract to ship materials from Canada toFrance during the First World War. When the war ended, he was appointed to theAllied Supreme Economic Council and he became advisor to the group around LordMilner and Colonel House of the Round Table as they prepared for the Treaty ofVersailles and the creation of the League of Nations. By 1919, his influence andreputation among the Round Table manipulators was such that he was named DeputySecretary General of the League of Nations. Six years later, he moved to Americaand became vice-president of a company owned by the Bank of America calledTransamerica. Monnet was now in the perfect position to coordinate theconspiracy, on both sides of the Atlantic, to create the European Community. Theother influential player was the Reptilian hybrid, Count Richard N.Coudenhove-Kalergi, who wrote a book in 1923 calling for a United States ofEurope. A close friend of the Count’s father was Theodore Herzl, a founder ofZionism and Rothschild puppet. The Count’s book was called Pan Europa and hewent on to form the Pan European Union with branches right across the continent,supported by leading European politicians, the Anglo-American cabal, includingColonel House and Herbert Hoover, and the usual crowd that come up everywhere.The word ‘Pan’ can mean ‘including everything’, but the god ‘Pan’ is alsoanother name for Nimrod and Europa is Semiramis. The Count said in hisautobiography:> At the beginning of 1924, we received a call from Baron Louis de Rothschild;> one of his friends, Max Warburg, from Hamburg, had read my book and wanted to> get to know us. To my great surprise [sure!], Warburg spontaneously [sure!]> offered us 60,000 gold marks to tide the movement over for its first three> years … Max Warburg, who was one of the most distinguished and wisest men that> I have ever come into contact with, had a principle of financing these> movements. He remained sincerely interested in Pan- Europe for his entire> life. Max Warburg arranged his 1925 trip to the United States to introduce me> to Paul Warburg and Bernard Baruch. Here we have the people I have been exposing so far, who manipulated other partsof the conspiracy, including the rise of Hitler and the creation of the FederalReserve, all involved in the manipulation of a centralised Europe. TheRothschilds, Rockefellers, Warburgs, Baruch, House and Milner were all in therefrom the start and many other familiar names were with them. Among the Count’ssupporters was Winston Churchill, who wrote an article in 1930 for the Americanpublication, the Saturday Evening Post, entitled ‘The United States of Europe’.Count Coudenhove-Kalergi was given enthusiastic backing from such ‘unbiased’sources as John Foster Dulles, Nicholas Murray Butler, the President of ColumbiaUniversity and the Carnegie Endowment for International War (sorry, ‘Peace’),and Dr Stephen Duggan, the founder and first president of the Institute ofEducation, which was 100 per cent-controlled by the Council on ForeignRelations. Those who funded the Bolshevik Revolution and both sides in the twoWorld Wars, including Adolf Hitler, were plotting to introduce the EuropeanCommunity as well as the United Nations. Jean Monnet was close to Franklin D.Roosevelt, thanks to his relationship with the President’s influential aideHarry Hopkins, who was to Roosevelt what Colonel House had been to PresidentWilson – his controller. Hopkins was recruited by Nelson Rockefeller to work onthe ‘Roosevelt’ New Deal economic strategy that actually prolonged the UnitedStates depression. Organisations like the Federal Union Movement – later theAtlantic Union Committee and the Atlantic Council of the United States – wereformed to press for the union of America and Britain. These bodies weredominated by Council on Foreign Relations members, and among the directors ofthe Atlantic Council in the 1970s were Father George Bush and Henry Kissinger.Familiar faces …The pressure and propaganda for a union of European nations reached new heightsin May 1948 when the United European Movement held its Congress of Europe. Theleading advocates of the movement were Winston Churchill and his son-in-law, theBritish politician Duncan Sandys, and working behind the scenes to great effectwere Jean Monnet and Joseph Retinger. The US Congress adopted seven resolutionson the political union of Europe. One of them stated: ‘The creation of a UnitedEurope must be regarded as an essential step towards the creation of a UnitedWorld’ [world government]. Monnet also headed the Committee for the UnitedStates of Europe, which had the same goal. The post-war American loans toEurope, known as the Marshall Plan or European Recovery Programme (ERP), wereused both to provide funds for the European movement, and to undermine theindependence of sovereign states to increase the pressure for the centralcontrol of Europe. This aid plan was supposed to be the work of General GeorgeC. Marshall, President Truman’s Secretary of State, but it is now known that thearchitects were Jean Monnet and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). In1946–47, a CFR study group was formed to report on the Reconstruction of Europe.The group was chaired by the lawyer, Charles M. Spofford, and the secretary wasDavid Rockefeller, chairman of the CFR, a leading influence in the BilderbergGroup and founder of the Trilateral Commission. Within little more than a year,this CFR ‘study group’ changed its name to the Marshall Plan and was sold asgovernment policy. The Illuminati’s Averell Harriman was chosen to head theMarshall Plan in Europe and made his headquarters at the Rothschild’s ParisMansion, Hotel Talleyrand. The proposal was not given an easy ride and therewere many Congressmen who could see through the smokescreen, but the Council onForeign Relations launched a propaganda offensive to ensure that the policy wasaccepted. They used CFR-controlled business and trade union bodies and theCFR-controlled media. The policy for a United States of Europe was givensterling support by The New York Times and Washington Post.The Reptilian hybrid-contrived ‘Cold War’ would also be very useful, as indeedit would be on so many occasions in the decades that followed. The need to makeloans to Europe to overcome the ‘threat of communism’ (which the hybrids hadfunded and created) was effectively used to win Congressional approval for theMarshall Plan. John J. McCloy, the chairman of the Council on Foreign Relationsfor nearly twenty years, said that his period as US High Commissioner to Germanyafter the war had shown him how the use of the communist threat could get thingsdone. ‘People sat up and listened when the Soviet threat was mentioned’, hesaid. (See also ‘threat from terrorism’, ‘threat from global warming’, etc,etc.) When the proposals secured approval, the Marshall Plan executive boardincluded CIA chief Allen W. Dulles, then president of the CFR; Philip Reed,chairman of General Electric; Henry L. Stimson and Robert P. Patterson, formersecretaries of war; and Dean Acheson, former undersecretary of state and memberof the CFR, who was in the US delegation at the formation of the United Nations.The first step in the creation of the European Community was the introduction ofthe European Coal and Steel Community, which started in July 1952, and mergedthe coal and steel industries of West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, theNetherlands and Luxemburg under one central control. It had the powers to decideprices, investment, raise money and make decisions by majority voting. It wasintroduced under the Schuman Plan (named after the French socialist foreignminister and later prime minister, Robert Schuman), but once again the manbehind it was Jean Monnet, the head of the French General Planning Commission.The idea won gushing praise from Council on Foreign Relations stalwarts like USSecretary of State John Foster Dulles and Dean Acheson. Monnet was awarded theWateler Peace Prize of two million francs to recognise the ‘international spiritwhich he had shown in conceiving the Coal and Steel Community’. The award camefrom … the Carnegie Foundation. Merry and Serge Bromberger, two admirers ofMonnet, set out the plan in their book, Jean Monnet and the United States ofEurope:> Gradually, it was thought, the supranational authorities, supervised by the> European Council of Ministers at Brussels and the Assembly in Strasbourg,> would administer all the activities of the Continent. A day would come when> governments would be forced to admit that an integrated Europe was an> accomplished fact, without their having had a say in the establishment of its> underlying principles. All they would have to do was to merge all these> autonomous institutions into a single federal administration and then proclaim> a United States of Europe. The ‘Tiptoes’On March 25th 1957, the six members of the Coal and Steel Community signed thetwo ‘Treaties of Rome’ to create the European Economic Community, or ‘CommonMarket’, and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). It was sold as a‘free trade zone’ which would be ‘good for jobs’ and there was no mention of acentralised superstate and loss of national sovereignty – which was the planfrom the start. The negotiations for the Treaties of Rome were controlled byMonnet with constant help from the Council on Foreign Relations network in theUnited States. This was confirmed by Harvard lecturer, Ernst H. van der Beugel,an honorary secretary-general of the Bilderberg Group and a member of theTrilateral Commission. In his book, From Marshall Aid To Atlantic Partnership(foreword by his friend, Henry Kissinger), he says:> Monnet and his action committee were unofficially supervising the negotiations> and as soon as obstacles appeared, the United States diplomatic machinery was> alerted, mostly through Ambassador Bruce … who had immediate access to the top> echelon of the State Department … > At that time, it was usual that if Monnet thought that a particular country> made difficulties in the negotiations, the American diplomatic representative> in that country approached the Foreign Ministry in order to communicate the> opinion of the American Government which, in practically all cases, coincided> with Monnet’s point of view. Monnet’s ‘point of view’ was that of the Reptilian hybrid elite who controlledhim. The Single European Act, which brought down trade barriers across Europefrom 1992, and the Maastricht Accords for European Union, were just moreTotalitarian Tiptoes along the road to the European dictatorship. Once thepeoples of Europe had been frightened into believing that if they didn’t jointhey would all face disaster, the word ‘Economic’ was dropped from the title andit became the European Community (tiptoe). Later, there was another name changeto the European Union (tiptoe). We have had the incessant move towards thecentralisation of political power in the community and the erosion of nationaldecision-making (tiptoe). This was followed by the creation of a EuropeanCentral Bank and single European currency (tiptoe). The concept of Europe withcentralised control administered by a European central bank, one currency,regional administration and common labour, transport, industrial and foreignpolicies, is exactly what Hitler and the Nazis planned for Europe. They evencalled their plan the European Economic Community (Europäische Wirtschaft =gemeinschaft). In his 1966 book, Tragedy And Hope, Illuminati insider, CarrollQuigley, explained how the process of European integration on all levels was tobe achieved in stages; and Richard N. Gardner of the Council on ForeignRelations was later to say how the plan was to ‘erode it [sovereignty] piece bypiece’. On November 9th 1988, the European leaders gathered at the Pantheon inParis to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Jean Monnet, the man called the‘Father of Europe’. But what was there to celebrate about Monnet’s creation? Ithas kept the peace in Western Europe since 1945? No, no. The Reptilian hybridshave allowed this to happen so that European integration could take place.Without the manipulators there would have been no pan-European wars anyway.Monnet created a monster which is in the process of devouring freedom – and heknew it.Bogus referendumsThe Reptilian hybrids want no less than a centrally-controlled dictatorship forthe whole of Europe and they are already very close to it as the non-electedbureaucrats in Brussels dictate to national governments. Even now the lawsimposed by the European Union override anything decided by national parliaments,and the planned European Constitution/‘Treaty’ includes the appointment of aPresident of Europe and a foreign affairs minister. The Constitution was signedon October 29th 2004 and only needed to be ratified by member states. France andthe Netherlands voted against it in referendums, but the manipulators have sincereintroduced most of the Constitution by calling it a ‘Treaty’ which, they say,does not require a public vote. Their technique with referendums is simple andconstantly repeated, as we have seen with Denmark and Ireland. They both voted‘no’ in referendums about Europe only for the decision to be later overturnedwhen the vote was repeated. The manipulators’ first choice is to do whateverthey want no matter what the people think. If they can’t get away with that whenthe change they desire is so fundamental, they offer a ‘referendum’ to ‘let thepeople decide’. The campaign in favour of what they want is then heavily funded,money no object, while the opposition has to beg and borrow what it can tocompete for public attention. If, despite all of this, the referendum still goesagainst them, they simply wait a while to give themselves time to target theopposition and then have another referendum. If they still think they can’t win,as with the Constitution, they enforce the change by other means, hence the 2007‘Treaty’. The agenda is not allowed to fall because of something so irrelevantto them as the will of the people. In typical Orwellian fashion, the ‘motto’ ofthis superstate is ‘United in diversity’ – United in enslavement if youtranslate from the Newspeak. The European Union has now ensnared twenty-sevenmember states with more to follow, and, as I said in my earlier books, the planwas to bring down the Soviet Union once it had been exploited for the Cold Warand absorb those countries into NATO (world army) and the European Union.The Soviet Union of EuropeIn 1984, the Soviet KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn warned that there would be a‘false liberalisation’ in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This would bewelcomed by the West, he said, and it would lead to a merger of the EuropeanCommunity and the countries of the former Soviet Union. It has turned outexactly as planned. On a visit to the European Parliament in 2006, anotherformer Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovksy, referred to secret Politburo andCentral Committee documents about the European Union that he was allowed to readin 1992. He said they confirmed the existence of a ‘conspiracy’ to turn Europeinto a ‘totalitarian state’. He called the EU a ‘monster’ and confirmed whatAnatoliy Golitsyn had said. The documents reveal that a Trilateral Commissiondelegation went to meet Soviet President Mikkal Gorbachev in January 1989. Itwas headed by David Rockefeller (Bilderberg Group) and Henry Kissinger(Bilderberg Group) and included former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing(Bilderberg Group). They were talking about the need for Gorbachev to integratethe Soviet Union into the GATT ‘free trade’ agreement, the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank, when Giscard d’Estaing intervened. He said:> Mr President, I cannot tell you exactly when it will happen – probably within> fifteen years – but Europe is going to be a federal state and you have to> prepare yourself for that. You have to work out with us, and the European> leaders, how you would react to that, how would you allow the other East> European countries to interact with it or how to become a part of it, you have> to be prepared. He was speaking three years before the Maastricht Treaty that turned theEuropean Community into the European Union and guess who drafted the proposedEuropean Constitution … Giscard d’Estaing. Had it not been for the ‘no’ votes byFrance and the Netherlands that constitution would have made Europe a ‘federalstate’ some seventeen years after he predicted ‘probably within fifteen’ toGorbachev. And there is no conspiracy? Anatoliy Golitsyn says the EuropeanParliament, which has no power worth the name, reminded him of the SupremeSoviet that was designed to look ‘supreme’ when the control was really in thehands of the bureaucrats at the Politburo, which Golitsyn said was exactly likethe European Commission today. ‘When you look at the type of EU corruption, itis exactly the Soviet type of corruption, going from top to bottom rather thangoing from bottom to top,’ he said.> If you go through all the structures and features of this emerging European> monster you will notice that it more and more resembles the Soviet Union ...> It has no KGB – not yet – but I am very carefully watching such structures as> Europol for example. That really worries me a lot because this organisation> will probably have powers bigger than those of the KGB. They will have> diplomatic immunity. Can you imagine a KGB with diplomatic immunity? > They will have to police us on thirty-two kinds of crimes – two of which are> particularly worrying, one is called racism, another is called xenophobia … So> it is a new crime, and we have already been warned. Someone from the British> government told us that those who object to uncontrolled immigration from the> Third World will be regarded as racist and those who oppose further European> integration will be regarded as xenophobes. The European Union wants to control all courts in every country of itsever-expanding empire and it is using the law to make outrageous attacks onbasic freedoms like freedom of expression and thought. A draft EU directiveproposed by Germany includes plans to outlaw Holocaust denial and create anoffence that does not exist in British law. The plans would also make it acriminal offence to deny the official version of conflicts in Africa and theBalkans. Such thought-crime (crimethink) and questioning of official historywould carry a jail sentence of up to three years for ‘genocide denial’.Unelected European Commission officials insisted that the legislation wasnecessary because ‘racism and xenophobia can manifest themselves in the form ofgenocide denial, so that it is very important to take strong action’. What anOrwellian phrase that is – ‘genocide denial’. They are now seeking to introducelegislation as fast as possible to stop the truth coming out because they knowthe dyke is about to break on public awareness of what is going on.Training the ‘useful idiots’The ‘middle management’ of the planned EU dictatorship is being ‘trained’ by anumber of groups, including one launched in the UK in 1988 called CommonPurpose. It has some forty-five British offices and has now taken its Sun symbollogo into many countries as Common Purpose International. These include France,Germany, Ghana, Hungary, India, Ireland, Netherlands, South Africa, Spain,Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. I understand it is also moving in on the UnitedStates. This is its stated goal:> Common Purpose aims to improve the way society works by expanding the vision,> decision making ability and influence of all kinds of leaders. The> organisation runs a variety of educational programmes for leaders of all ages,> backgrounds and sectors, in order to provide them with the inspiration,> information and opportunities they need to change the world. From such bland descriptions come two questions immediately: A common purpose(uniformity) to what end? And ‘change the world’ in what way exactly? We needanswers here because Common Purpose is sweeping through the UK, ‘training’leaders in all areas of society, and if they have a ‘common purpose’ we ought toknow about it. Those who complete the courses are called Common Purpose‘graduates’ and throughout British society such ‘graduates’ are at work ingovernment, law enforcement, health and many other areas that affect daily life.I keep seeing a picture of George Orwell in my mind. He is shaking his head andsmiling. The official founder and Chief Executive of Common Purpose is JuliaMiddleton who, in her profile at the Common Purpose UK Website (www.commonpurpose.org.uk [http://www.common%20purpose.org.uk]), failed to mention a ratherrelevant fact: she was also Head of Personnel Selection in the office of JohnPrescott, the Deputy Prime Minister to Tony Blair. Prescott was the man withresponsibility for creating ‘regional assemblies’ around the United Kingdomwhich are part of the plan to abolish nations and bring their powerless‘regions’ under the jackboot of the European Union. He has, of course, sought tosell this policy as ‘devolving power to the people’.The European superstate is designed to be centrally-controlled and managed atlower levels by bland and brain dead ‘leaders’ who are all programmed to thinkthe same. This is where Common Purpose comes in. You can always tell anIlluminati front by its desire to centralise everything and that includes thecentralisation of thought, as diversity is scorned, ridiculed and dismissed infavour of a manufactured ‘consensus’. You will also see the Orwellian Newspeaktechnique in which the organisation claims to stand for what it is seeking todestroy – Common Purpose says its aim is to develop ‘diverse’ leaders.Illuminati fronts always tend to use language that actually says nothing whendescribing what they do. The propaganda for Common Purpose is bland and withoutspecifics, just as you would expect. What does this organisation teach its‘leaders’? You wouldn’t know by reading its blurb and with its courses costingthousands of pounds it would be expensive to find out. For sure, it willmanufacture consensus among its ‘diverse’ clientele. This is a fundamentaltechnique of the Reptilian hybrids throughout society – to manipulate agreementon a range of issues that then become the norm to be defended from all challengeand true diversity. It has been developed by organisations like the TavistockInstitute of Human Relations in London, which was funded into existence in 1946with a grant from the Rockfeller Foundation. It is one of the Illuminati’sglobal centres for developing the ‘hive mind’ mentality, or ‘group andorganisational behaviour’. Tavistock works closely with ‘public sector’(state-controlled) organisations, including the UK government and the EuropeanUnion, and the Orwell-speak on its website could have come straight from thepages of Common Purpose. Or the other way round. Jargon is always the languageof the junta:> Multi-organisational working, cross-boundary working and the> global-national-local interface each raise their own set of organisational> dynamics which must be surfaced and worked with if collaboration is to be> effective. They also raise particular challenges for leadership (and> followership). The Institute’s approaches to organisational consultancy and> leadership development, based on organisational theory and systems> psychodynamics are particularly appropriate for helping organisations to> address these complex issues. What, like working out what the hell all that is supposed to mean? We can seethat Tavistock and Common Purpose share the same pod. Both want to develop‘leaders’ and they do it in the same way by manufactured consensus that stampsout diversity by using those who have conceded their right to free thought tothe group psyche to pressure others to conform. Mind manipulation techniqueslike Neuro-Linguistic Programming or NLP are also employed in the language toengineer consensus. NLP is a technique of using words to re-program thebody-computer to accept another perception of reality – in this case theconsensus agreed by the manipulators before their victims even register for the‘course’. NLP can be used to re-program in a positive way, it depends how it isused. Apparently, the CIA refers to these pre-agreed ‘opinions’ as ‘slides’. Asone Internet writer said:> A ‘slide’ is a prefabricated, ‘politically correct’ blanket ‘pop’ ‘opinion’,> ‘view’ or ‘take’ upon a particular issue of general interest which is designed> to preclude further consideration, analysis or investigation of the issue in> question. In other words, it is a ‘collectivised’ mental position which is> never to be questioned. This is precisely the ‘product’ of the Deputy Prime> Minister’s insidious neurological linguistic control programme ‘Common> Purpose’. Anyone who resists the programming is isolated and the group turned against themuntil they either conform or lose credibility to be a ‘leader’. Look at globalsociety in any country and you will see this happening in the workplace, amongfriends down the bar and in television discussions. The consensus on globalwarming has been manipulated to be that carbon emissions are the cause, andanyone who says otherwise is uncaring, selfish, racist and quite happy to seethe planet and humanity face catastrophe. The fact that carbon emissions are notthe cause of global warming is irrelevant. The ‘truth’ is whatever the consensushas agreed it to be. In short, if you don’t agree with the extreme consensus youare an extremist. The Tavistock Institute has been working this flanker fordecades and Common Purpose seems to me to have the Curriculum Vitae of aTavistock front. One of the Tavistock founders, Dr John Rawlings Rees, who alsobecame co-founder of the World Federation for Mental Health, talked ofinfiltrating all professions and areas of society – ‘Public life, politics andindustry should all ... be within our sphere of influence … If we are toinfiltrate the professional and social activities of other people I think wemust imitate the Totalitarians and organize some kind of fifth column activity!’He said that the ‘salesmen’ of their perception re-programming (massmind-control) must lose their identity and operate secretly. He went on:> We must aim to make it permeate every educational activity in our national> life ... We have made a useful attack upon a number of professions. The two> easiest of them naturally are the teaching profession and the Church: the two> most difficult are law and medicine. The common purpose of the Tavistock/Illuminati guerrilla war on the human psycheis to wipe clean any sense of the individual and unique. Only that way can theyimpose the global dictatorship and have the masses accept it. Brock Chisholm,former Director of the UN World Health Organisation, was right when he said: ‘Toachieve One-World Government, it is necessary to remove from the minds of mentheir individualism’. Enter Common Purpose and its training of ‘leaders’. If youcan get the leaders to think the same it makes it much easier to transfer thatto the general population. Julia Middleton’s organisation, and whoever andwhatever else is really behind it, has been making dramatic inroads into Britishsociety while it has flown below the radar. It is time we gave it a much higherprofile as it goes ever-more international. Brian Gerrish at www.eutruth.org.uk[http://www.eutruth.org.uk] discovered Common Purpose when he was involved witha group in Plymouth in the west of England helping people find jobs, and one oftheir projects was repairing wooden boats. He said they had lots of publicsupport and backing from the local authorities and everything was going fine.But then it suddenly changed and the council support was withdrawn. When theytried to continue alone, he said that within a short time people were beingthreatened:> When we started to explore why we were being threatened we were absolutely> staggered to find a very strange organisation called Common Purpose operating> in the city. And we were absolutely amazed that there were so many people> involved, but they were not declaring themselves ... > [Common Purpose] was operating throughout the structure of the city, in the> city council, in the government offices, in the police, in the judiciary.> Essentially, we discovered what is effectively, at best, a quasi secret> society which doesn’t declare itself to ordinary people. Further research has led Gerrish to establish that Common Purpose is recruitingand training leaders to be loyal to the objectives of the organisation and theEuropean Union, and preparing the governing structure for what it calls the‘post-democratic society’ after nations are replaced by regions in the EuropeanUnion. ‘They are learning to rule without regard to democracy, and will bringthe EU police state home to every one of us’, Gerrish says. Common Purposegraduate, Cressida Dick, issued the ‘shoot-to-kill’ order to police officersthat led to an innocent Brazilian electrician, Jean Charles de Menezes, beingheld down by police and shot eight times at point blank range, seven of them inthe head. Cressida Dick has since been outrageously promoted from Commander toDeputy Assistant Commissioner in the Metropolitan Police. Janet Paraskeva, theLaw Society’s Chief Executive Officer, is also a Common Purpose graduate andthere are many, and increasing, numbers in the law and enforcement professions.Common Purpose meetings are held under the ‘Chatham House rule’ in whichparticipants are free to use the information received but not to reveal theidentity or affiliation of the source, nor anyone else participating. ChathamHouse is the headquarters of the Illuminati’s Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs, which is part of the Round Table web that includes the Council onForeign Relations and Trilateral Commission in the United States. It introducedthe ‘Chatham House rule’ to keep its meetings secret while still having itspolicy promoted on a non-attributable basis. From the efforts of the TavistockInstitute and related organisations has come a common network with a commonpurpose that is leading to the rapid and coordinated introduction of Newspeak,political correctness and ‘management initiatives’ that lead us ever furtherdown the road to tyranny.Mr Dark Eyes and the EU sell-outThe story of how Britain became involved in the European fly-trap serves as awarning to every nation. The techniques I am describing are being used now tomanipulate your country into compliance with the superstate agenda. The majorpoliticians of all major parties say one thing in public while pursuing a verydifferent path behind the scenes. The most important public face of Britain’sentry into the European Community/Union was our old fiend (no spelling error),the shapeshifting child abuser and Conservative Party Prime Minister, EdwardHeath (Bilderberg Group). This was the guy whose eyes turned black when I waswith him in the television studio make-up room. He was the lackey of Lord VictorRothschild, who also controlled Heath’s ‘opponent’, the Labour Party leaderHarold Wilson (Bilderberg Group) in the 1960s and early 1970s. Heath wasagreeing to British political union with Europe as far back as April 1962 whenhe was Lord Privy Seal in the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan. Hetold the Ministerial Council of the Western European Union that ‘… you havedecided that those who join the Economic Communities as full members must alsojoin the Political Union. I am sure that this was the right decision’ (CommandPaper 1720). At the same time, the people were being told that the Common Marketwas only a free trade zone, even though a Foreign Office memo in 1971 warned: ‘…the Community is a process of fundamental political importance implyingprogressive development towards a political union’. This memo was suppressed forthirty years. Before Heath signed Britain into Europe, he attended a meeting inParis in October 1972 to negotiate the conditions with French President GeorgesPompidou (Bilderberg Group), a former employee of Guy Rothschild. Heath’sSecretary of State for Industry, John Davies, was at the meeting and told theConservative Party’s ‘Monday Club’ group that it had been agreed that Britainwould run down its manufacturing industry and London would become the moneymarket of Europe. Heath also conceded British sovereignty of its territorialfishing waters and the EU Common Fisheries Policy has devastated the Britishfishing industry in a land surrounded by sea.Heath Cabinet papers released in 2001 reveal that the government and civilservants conspired to hide what had been agreed – ‘[Ministers believed]… itvital not to get drawn into an explanation of what was going on or to admit whata disaster was in store for Britain’s fishermen [who] in the wider context mustbe regarded as expendable’. Heath wrote that ‘the government is determined tosecure proper safeguards for the British fishing industry’ and Geoffrey Rippon,who was part of Heath’s negotiating team, told the House of Commons: ‘We retainfull jurisdiction over our coastal waters’. Both knew that was a lie. Heath wasasked in 1990 in a BBC interview if he had known all along that Britain wassigning up to a federal European state. He replied: ‘Of course, yes’. By then itdidn’t matter, the deed was long done. Sir Crispin Tickle, one of Heath’snegotiators, has admitted that the government covered up the full implicationsof membership and said the rule was ‘don’t talk about this in public’. The ideafrom the start has been to structure the union so that different countries havetheir own specialisation and lose the ability to be self-reliant. This is whyHeath and subsequent prime ministers have agreed to let Britain’s manufacturingindustry decline so dramatically and the fishing and farming industries to berun down. They are designated for other ‘sectors’ of the union withmanufacturing, for example, being moved to the countries of the former SovietUnion where labour costs are cheaper. Britain’s specialisation decreed by themanipulators is banking and ‘service industries’ and that, it is clear to see,is what has happened to the UK economy. Daily events only make sense when youunderstand the game being played and to what end.Prime Minister Heath signed the Treaty of Accession to the Treaty of Rome andBritain was in the European spider’s web from January 1st 1973. Heath acceptedat the time of Britain’s entry that Britain would renounce her nationalsovereignty and become part of a federal Europe – as did the Labour Party’sHarold Wilson (Bilderberg Group) and James Callaghan (Bilderberg Group) duringthe ‘renegotiation’ of British membership in 1974-75. The same is happeningtoday behind the scenes in the United States with the Republicans and Democrats(Republicrats), as I will come to shortly. British local government wasreorganised to reshape the country in preparation for the European superstate,and ‘devolution’ of power to the countries of the UK, as with the Scottish andWelsh Assemblies, have been introduced to prepare for the plan for a Europe of‘regions’. These regions would be given limited powers, akin to the countycouncils of today, and they would be administered by those who control thesuperstate. The Maastricht Treaty on European Union even uses the word‘municipal’ elections when it talks of national elections within Europe.Image [../Images/00221.jpg]Figure 212: The Europe the Reptilian hybrids are manipulating into place. Acentralised superstate dictating to administrative regions after countries andnations are destroyed In 1980, the European Commission published a map of regions. When the absence of‘England’ on the map was questioned by a researcher called Dr Kitty Little, andher colleagues, they were told that the national government would no longer bean ‘administrative unit’. This was confirmed in 2006 when a new map of Europewas produced for the European Union by German cartographers for a project withthe classic Orwellian title of ‘Interreg’ (Figure 212). It is straight from thepages of 1984 and the map has shocked those who have bothered to consider itsenormous implications. It ‘sectors’ Europe into a series of administrativeregions under the control of the Union bureaucracy and purposely puts differentparts of the same country into different regions. The ‘Trans-Manche region’includes parts of England and France, while the west of England and part ofScotland, plus Northern Ireland, are lumped together with the Atlantic coasts ofFrance, Spain and Portugal. The countries of Wales and the Irish Republic becomeone administrative entity and the north of Scotland joins with Iceland. Most ofEngland and Scotland come under the sector including Denmark and southernScandinavia. This Europe of regions will be controlled by unelected EuropeanCommissioners at the Politburo and the six members of the Executive Board of theEuropean Central Bank, who have control of the single currency and reserves ofeach member ‘State’. These six people, who will control the whole of theEuropean Union through control of finance, shall ‘be appointed from amongpersons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary orbanking matters’ – (Maastricht Treaty, Article 109a, page UP-UEM/eu41). This isOrwellian-speak for six international bankers controlled by the Rothschilds. Intheir eight years of guaranteed security of tenure, these super six from theReptilian hybrid banking system ‘may not seek or take instructions fromCommunity Institutions … or any other body’.The other ‘unions’What I have just described with regard to Britain and Europe is planned foreveryone, as I have been warning since the early 1990s. It has been a long-termplan to centralise power in Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia-Australia viagroupings promoted initially as free trade areas, or for ‘cooperation’ and‘coordination’, but later evolving into the European Union, American Union,African Union and the Asia/Pacific Union. The European Economic Community ‘freetrade area’ was the first and this has been followed by the North American FreeTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which involves the US, Canada, and Mexico; and AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC. Asian political leaders at theInternational Conference for Asian Political Parties have adopted the ‘SeoulDeclaration’ for the establishment of an Asian Union and a ‘joint campaign tofight terrorism, poverty and weapons of mass destruction’. In 2001, the AfricanEconomic Community and Organisation of African Unity became the African Unionwith its own flag and a commitment to a single African currency and singleintegrated defence force, as well as other institutions, including a cabinet forthe African Union head of state. It’s the same blueprint all over the world and,by now, you will see how it can all be coordinated across the planet. TheAmerican Union is due to include the whole of the American continent and bringan end to the sovereignty of every country. The North American ‘Free Trade’Agreement, or NAFTA, was just the first ‘tiptoe’. They want to break up theUnited States into regions, as in Europe, and these were officially created aslong ago as 1972 by Executive Order 11647, signed by Richard Nixon (Figure 213).The insider news anchorman and Bohemian Grover, Walter Cronkite, was describingthis agenda when he said that a system of world government was mandatory:> I think we are realizing that we are going to have to have an international> rule of law. We need not only an executive to make international law, but we> need the military forces to enforce that law. American people are going to> begin to realize that perhaps they are going to have to yield some sovereignty> to an international body to enforce the law. Image [../Images/00222.jpg]Figure 213: The American regions designated by President Nixon’s Executive Order Better have a world government and army then, eh, Walt? That’s another thing towatch for – the Newspeak term, ‘international law’. We keep hearing questionslike: ‘Is it within international law?’ ‘Was it against international law?’‘Would it breach international law?’ It’s like everything is okay, so long asit’s in line with ‘international law’. However, it is worth remembering that theReptilian hybrids are building their global Orwellian state through‘international law’ – the law that everyone on earth is supposed to obey. It isnot whether the law is ‘international’ or applies only to your neighbourhood.The question is whether it is fair, just, or even necessary. To hear somepeople, you would think that slaughtering hundreds of thousands in Iraq is wrongif it breaches international law, but fine if it complies. Crazy. Slaughteringpeople is evil and no law can stop it being so.Bye, bye AmericaThe North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was signed by PresidentFather George Bush in 1992 in league with Canadian Prime Minister BrianMulroney, his fellow Illuminati initiate and abuser of mind-controlled women andchildren. President Carlos Salinas, another Father Bush-controlled ‘leader’,signed for Mexico. It doesn’t matter which ‘party’ is in power the agenda rollson because all are controlled by the same coordinating force. Father GeorgeBush, a ‘Republican’, said when NAFTA was launched that he wished to see a freetrade area stretching from the top of North America to the tip of South America.Bill Clinton, a ‘Democrat’, said at a gathering of leaders from throughout theAmerican continent on December 10th 1994:> History has given the people of the Americas the chance to build a community> of nations, committed to liberty and the promise of prosperity … early in the> next century [I want to see] … a huge free trade zone from Alaska to> Argentina. NAFTA has been a disaster for American industry and so much else besides, as thecorporations have moved their factories to Mexico where they can pay theirworkers far less and ship their products back to the United States and Canadawithout having to pay the import duties they would have done before the ‘freetrade’ area was created. This is what ‘free trade’ really is. It gives theReptilian hybrid corporations the freedom to manufacture in the poorestcountries at the lowest possible price and sell them in the rich countries atthe highest possible price with no added costs as they cross a border. Thisallows people in both the poorest and richest nations to be exploited formaximum profit. ‘Free trade’ is merely the freedom to exploit at will, and theyhave so manipulated the language and perception through their Orwellian term‘free trade’ that it is now politically incorrect to be against it. ‘Oh yes,everyone knows that free trade is good, how can anyone be against that?’ TheWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) was created in 1995 to manipulate dependency onthe world economic system by forcing countries to drop their barriers toimports. This concept of ‘free trade’ was advocated in the 19th century by theScottish economist, Adam Smith, and it was designed, at least in part, tojustify Britain’s refusal to stop the exports of opium to China. Pressure forAdam Smith’s view led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in May 1846, which removedprotection for British agriculture from overseas imports. It was a disastrouspolicy, but ‘free’ trade has come a long way since then and the World TradeOrganisation now has the power to impose colossal fines on countries that refuseto open their markets as the WTO demands.Another stepping stone …The next stage in the tiptoe to the American Union is now well advanced as theyprepare to turn NAFTA, the ‘free trade zone’, into the North American Union witha new single currency to replace the dollar and the peso. Once again, theRothschild–Rockefeller Council on Foreign Relations, which was seriouslyinvolved in the establishment of the European Union and the United Nations, isat the heart of what is happening. One of the CFR’s projects is the ‘Securityand Prosperity Partnership of North America’ (SPP), which is a front for themerger of the United States, Canada, Mexico and the rest of the Americas. Itpromises a ‘safer and more prosperous North America’ when the real reason iscontrol. The SPP agreement was signed by Boy Bush, Mexican President Vicente Foxand Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin in Waco, Texas on March 23rd 2005. Ithas been described as ‘NAFTA on steroids’. The Council on Foreign Relations isnow openly calling for the union of Mexico, Canada and the United States and anew single currency called the ‘Amero’, a name used by Robert Pastor, avice-chairman of the CFR ‘task force’ that produced the report called ‘Buildinga North American Union’. This is one reason why the once almighty dollar isbeing undermined at home and abroad. They want to dilute resistance to itspassing. This CFR guy, Robert Pastor, is director of the Center for NorthAmerican Studies at American University and advisor to ‘Democratic’ presidentslike Clinton. He was stating the official policy of the Reptilian hybrids whenhe told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee of his support for concedingpower over the United States to what advocates call a ‘super-regional governanceboard’ (see European Union). Pastor, who wears a lapel badge bearing the flagsof the US, Canada and Mexico, attended a conference in 2007 about a common legalsystem for all three countries under the title of the North American Court ofJustice. But, like Ted Heath, he tries not to use the term ‘union’. He refers toit as the ‘emerging entity called North America’. The Ministry of Truth shouldrecruit him immediately. Other plans for the North American Union include:> •Congress conceding its power to a North American Parliamentary Group.> •A North America Tribunal on Trade and Investment having precedence over the> US Supreme Court.> •A North American Customs and Immigration Service controlling American> immigration policy and trade.Naturally it would be the same for Canada, Mexico and any other countries laterinvolved, because they want the whole of North, Central and South America in theend. The countries would lose control of their own lands and decision-making,just as the countries of Europe are now satellites of the European Union. Themost obvious confirmation of what is planned is the ‘North American SuperCorridor’, a road four football fields wide to connect Mexico with the US andCanada, and encompassing Interstate Highways 35, 29 and 94 (Figure 214). It willallow goods from China and the Far East to be shipped to Mexican ports anddriven into the heartland of America and up into Canada without even stopping atthe border. They would be ‘checked’ electronically and while I was writing thisbook there was another ‘tiptoe’ when Mexican trucks were given full access to UShighways. Mexican-registered trucks were only allowed to make deliveries in theUnited States within special commercial zones along the border, but a newagreement allowed up to 100 Mexican trucking companies to operate beyond thecommercial zones with no limit to the number of trucks they can have in theUnited States.Image [../Images/00223.jpg]Figure 214: The planned ‘North American Super Corridor’ The central processing point of the ‘North American Super Corridor’ would beKansas City, where an organization called Kansas City SmartPort Inc., an‘investor-based organization supported by the public and private sector’, wouldtransfer goods to other trucks to be transported across North America. Theimpact is sure to be devastating to the west coast ports of the United States asshipping heads for Mexico instead. Work on the first section of the highwaythrough Texas is in preparation, and quietly, without public debate or comment,the whole project has been in the planning for years. It involves dozens ofagencies, organisations and government departments. The project is beingcoordinated by the North America SuperCorridor Coalition Inc. (NASCO), whichdescribes itself as ‘a non-profit organization dedicated to developing theworld’s first international, integrated and secure, multi-modal transportationsystem along the International Mid-Continent Trade and Transportation Corridorto improve both the trade competitiveness and quality of life in North America’.It’s the same old crap we heard in Europe when they were selling the superstate– it will bring prosperity, jobs and a better way of life’. Behind the Newspeak,however, it is about centralisation of power, transferring American and Canadianjobs to Mexico and eventually the rest of Central and South America, andexploiting workers in those countries in the same way that those in the Far Eastand elsewhere are living in servitude to the transnationals today (Figure 215,overleaf).Under the radarWe have seen how people like Ted Heath lied about Europe and the same ishappening in North America where the political policy is once again: ‘Don’t talkabout this in public’. Secret meetings take place that are reported only by thealternative media when information leaks out. One took place at Fairmont SpringsHotel at Banff in Alberta, Canada in 2006, when politicians, military top brassand corporate executives came together. Among them were Canada’s Minister ofDefense, Gordon O’Connor, Minister of Public Security, Stockwell Day, Chief ofDefense Staff, General Rick Hellier, and the commander of US ‘defence’organisations, NorthCom and NORAD, Admiral Tim Keating. Leading policy advisorsto the then US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, were also in attendance,along with top executives of major corporations like Lockheed Martin, Chevron,Mexico’s PEMEX and Suncor Energy. The meeting was co-chaired by George Shultz,former Secretary of State to Reagan/Bush and president and director of BechtelCorporation. Bohemian-Grover Shultz is extremely active in the Reptilian hybridnetwork and comes up all over the place. He has been described as the ‘politicalgodfather’ of Boy Bush and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, anotherReptilian hybrid place man. The meeting discussed North American defence,national security, borders, immigration, military production and North America’senergy reserves. They also discussed a plan called ‘Deep Integration’ developedby the ‘Independent Task Force for North America’ and led by American, Canadianand Mexican officials, including former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister, JohnManley, and Tom Aquino, President of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives.As its Orwellian title would suggest, the ‘task force’ is anything but‘independent’ and is sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2006, Iflew to Canada at the invitation of an independent television company in StJohn’s, Newfoundland, and soon realised that the TV station had booked me into ahotel where a meeting was being held of all the premiers of Canada. The placewas crawling with politicians and media and I found myself in the elevator/liftwith British Columbia Premier, Gordon Campbell, plus minders. I took the chanceto ask him if they were discussing the North American Union:> ‘Not much’, replied Campbell.> ‘Do the Canadian people know about the North American Union?’, I asked.> ‘No.’> ‘Well, don’t you think it is about time they did?’> No reply.> ‘Are you talking about the Amero?’, I persisted.> ‘I would tell you if I knew what it was’, came Campbell’s staggering response.> ‘It’s the currency to replace the Canadian dollar, the American dollar and the> peso’, I said.> No reply.Image [../Images/00224.jpg]Figure 215: So long America, Canada and Mexico. Thanks for the memories At this point the door opened at a floor and a very large man, Campbell’sapparent minder, stepped forward, grabbed my arm and told me I was leaving atthis floor. I told him, shall we say in no uncertain terms, that he should takehis hands off me immediately, because I was getting out at my floor and not whenhe dictated. He backed off at once, apparently shocked that I was unimpressedeither by him or his body size. When I reached my floor, he stepped forwardagain to stand between me and Campbell. I said that he shouldn’t worry. It wasnot me who was violent, it was governments, and he really would be betteremployed protecting me from them. What I experienced from this little cameo isthat Campbell certainly knew what I was talking about. The idea he has neverheard of the single currency is ludicrous and all the ‘leading’ politicians ofCanada and the United States know full well that the North American Union isfast approaching to bring an end to national sovereignty. But they would ratherthe people don’t know until it’s a done deal. Ask most Americans if they thinktheir country would ever be absorbed into a superstate that could override thedecisions of Washington and they would probably laugh. ‘We’re America, the mostpowerful country in the world – we’ll always be America.’ The irony is that,even as they speak those words, their national sovereignty and right toself-governance are being stripped away. It is being done as quietly as possibleso not to alert a slumbering population to their imminent plight, but it hasreached the point where even former sceptics have begun to see the obvious. Iwas sent an article on the Conservative Voice website, headed ‘Canada, theUnited States, and Mexico ... a possible merger?’. The writer says:> If someone would have told me last year that some of our leaders in our> government and those of the powerful elite in this country were plotting to> merge Canada, the United States and Mexico, I would have brushed it aside as a> conspiracy theory. Yes, it seems wild, however as we face the huge illegal> immigration issue, many conservatives are now starting to put the pieces> together. In April 2007, they had another piece to deal with when the United States andthe European Union signed a ‘transatlantic economic partnership’ at a summit inWashington. We were told that this was laying the ground for a US-EU singlemarket and was designed to introduce ‘regulatory convergence’ in nearly fortyareas, including intellectual property, financial services, business takeoversand the motor industry. What do you need for a world government? The globalconvergence of ‘regulatory standards’. The plans for the North American Unionare now so far advanced behind the scenes that we can expect the familiar namesto publicly propose it before much longer.War on the nation stateAs I have said many times over the years, the sense of national identity is apotentially fatal block on the plan for the world government tyranny, so we havehad the decades-old campaign to discredit and destroy the idea of sovereignnations. I am not a nationalist and I don’t identify who I am with a country ora race, but that’s not the point. Many do and while this continues they willresist any attempts to absorb their beloved lands into a manufactured culturalcocktail designed to consume diversity. The reason the US government is doing solittle to stem the tide of illegal immigration across the Mexican border is (a)to advance the plan I have just described and (b) what is the point ofincreasing patrols and security when you intend to bring down the borderaltogether once you think you can get away with it? Across the world, theimmigration controversy is now a familiar theme. In the United States, there areprotests about the scale of immigration, especially from Mexico, and throughoutEurope immigration is seen as one of the major issues of the time with millionscondemning the influx of people from Eastern Europe and elsewhere. So manyEastern Europeans have flooded into the UK since their countries joined theEuropean Union and borders came down that some banks have opened Polish branchesand telephone services, and there has been at least one case of road signs beingwritten in Polish. It is estimated that 265,000 Poles have come to Britain quitelegally in two years and they will go on coming. What’s going on here with the‘immigration crisis’, ultimately created by the Reptilian hybrids?One major way of destroying a sense of nationhood over the generations andopening the way for world government is to have an influx of people from othercultures. The idea is that the native one loses its unchallenged status as theprime blueprint for what constitutes being ‘British’, ‘German’ or wherever.Gradually, what being ‘British’ actually means becomes blurred in the meltingpot of competing cultures until they pretty much merge into a cocktail thatdefies definition. Such an indefinable perception of ‘nation’ is far morewilling to concede power to the world government structure than someone whowants to protect the sovereignty of his or her nation state. Trouble is, whenyou start to point out the hidden agenda behind ‘multiculturalism’, you areimmediately tagged with the ‘r’ word – racist. That’s the level at which theIlluminati want this ‘debate’ to be played out. On one side you have the ‘whitesupremacists’ wanting their race to control their country, and on the other youhave the Robot Radical ‘anti-fascist’ fascists, with their unblemishedhearts-on-their-sleeves, branding everyone with another opinion a ‘racist’. Thispolarisation and name-calling obscures, on purpose, the deeper meaning behindimmigration policies. It is not about this race or that race, this culture orthat culture. It is about creating one culture, a global uniformity thatdisconnects people from an association with nation and uniqueness, so theyaccept the loss of nationhood to the global Orwellian State. The current assaulton Islam is part of this. I am not a Muslim and I don’t agree with much of whatit says, but that is irrelevant to the point – just as ‘racism’ is irrelevant tothe real agenda behind immigration policies. We need to raise ourselves abovethese juvenile levels of ‘debate’ and look at the big picture. They want toundermine Islam because it represents a vast grouping of people, united by basicbelief, who would resist being absorbed into the One World global culture ofcentralised dictatorship, known by some researchers as the ‘New World Order’.This is why they want Muslims fighting each other, the same with the rest of us.All races, all cultures and all religions need to appreciate that we are in thistogether. The freedom of everyone is at stake here.The Reptilian hybrid government–corporate nexus doesn’t want an independentpopulous that has choice. They want a dependent people at the mercy of those whowill give them a job at whatever wage the bosses decide. This has been happeningin Africa and other parts of the world since the British and others moved in.The corporations, again in league with their governments, first destroyed thenative peoples’ ability to be self-sufficient, and then, once dependency wassecured, they employed them at starvation pay. Look what happened to the NativeAmericans when the Europeans arrived – precisely the same. Their independencewas destroyed, not least by killing the buffalo, and they were at the mercy ofthe US government. Now, the so-called middle and working class whites and otherraces are the target for these techniques and a major vehicle for bringing thisabout is mass immigration and ‘outsourcing’ or ‘offshoring’. Whether thecorporations take the jobs to poorer countries where they can pay far lowerwages, or they bring people into the rich nations to do the jobs for lower paythere, the outcome is the same. A loss of jobs and lower pay for the residentpopulation. ‘You don’t want to do the job for that money? Okay, next! Plentywhere you came from.’The expansion of the European Union into Eastern Europe has allowed workers fromlow wage economies like Poland and the Czech Republic to move withoutimmigration controls to Western Europe to undercut the wages of the indigenouspopulation. I am not blaming them for that, nor those who take the jobsoutsourced from Britain to India, and so on. Most are as much victims in thisgame as those who lose their livelihood as a result. I was on an English ferryboat the other day and every single member of the catering staff was fromEastern Europe with not a clue about what they were doing. I dread to think thepittance they were being paid. Both groups are being exploited, those who arepaid disgracefully low wages and those whose jobs they take. The Illuminati wantto bring these groups into conflict because it fuels still further their policyof divide and rule. They are highly skilled at bringing two or moremutually-exploited groups into confrontation as the groups blame each other fortheir plight instead of realising that they are all being manipulated by thesame force to the same end. Immigration and outsourcing have another crucialeffect, too. By bringing enormous numbers of people from other cultures into acountry you dilute the dominant culture; and by outsourcing western industry toother nations you dilute their dominant culture and way of life. Add to that themassive influence of Hollywood and American TV in selling the Illuminati‘culture’ to the world, and no wonder country after country is starting to liveand look increasingly the same. We had a glimpse of the future if the plan comesto fruition with the poverty and misery of the manufactured Great Depression inthe 1930s. The idea is to trigger another one, globally, and maintain itindefinitely. Hungry people with families to feed will do whatever you tell themand they will be open to support aggression against anyone they can be – falsely– persuaded is responsible. Either we unite behind an understanding of what isreally going on, or we fall into global imprisonment by fighting amongourselves.Partners in crimeUnderpinning these policies are other global fronts for the Reptilian hybridagenda such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), World Bank and the Knights ofMalta-controlled International Monetary Fund (IMF). After the Second World War,with the nations of Europe devastated by conflict and debt to the Illuminatibankers, the global domination of money and credit was further advanced when thecreation of the World Bank, IMF and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT) were all agreed by British and American negotiators at a conference inBretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944. Most influential in these agreements werethe British economist, Lord Keynes, and the US Treasury Secretary, Harry DexterWhite (Council on Foreign Relations). White and Alger Hiss, the secretarygeneral at the launch of the United Nations, would later be exposed as communistspies. The technical secretary at Bretton Woods was Virginius Frank Coe, anofficial of the US Treasury and he was appointed secretary of the new IMF untilit was revealed in 1952 during congressional testimony that he was also a memberof Dexter White’s communist ring! These were the guys who created the IMF, WorldBank, and GATT, the forerunner to the World Trade Organisation.The role of the World Bank (not to be confused with the planned world centralbank) is to make loans to governments for large capital projects. These havebeen used to finance infrastructure in poor countries designed to meet the needsof the multinationals. These include policies forcing people from the land,destroying self-sufficient lifestyles and creating dependency on the Reptilianhybrid global economy. Much of the destruction of the rainforests has been donewith loans from the World Bank, which is always headed by appointees from theCFR, Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg Group establishment, and has eugenicsas a pillar of its policy. The subsidised environmental destruction has anotherplus for the elite. It helps them justify world control by the need to ‘save theplanet’. A role of the World Bank and other global economic ‘agencies’ is tomake a fortune for the multinational construction companies like the BechtelGroup, headed for a long time by Bush ‘political godfather’, George Shultz. Thescam is played by the World Bank and IMF making loans to Third World countriesfor mega construction projects which are irrelevant, even disastrous, for theneeds of the local people. In April 1995, President Bill Clinton successfullynominated James Wolfensohn to be the new President of the World Bank.Wolfensohn, an Australian-born naturalised American, had the perfect backgroundfor the post. He worked for the Rockefellers’ ‘population control’ organisation,the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Institute of AdvancedStudies at Princeton and Brookings Institute. He was also on the steeringcommittee of the Bilderberg Group, a member of the Council on Foreign Relationsand Trilateral Commission, and, in 1992, he joined forces with the Rothschildsto form J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn, a ‘business advice consultancy’. Its chairmanwas Paul Volcker, former head of the Federal Reserve Board and leading member ofthe Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg Group.Volcker was the man who launched the devastating economic policies in the UnitedStates and UK in the 1980s, which were fronted by Ronald Reagan and MargaretThatcher under the names ‘Reaganomics’ and ‘Thatcherism’. Sumerian- KhazarWolfensohn was replaced as President of the World Bank in 2005 by Sumerian-Khazar Paul Wolfowitz, the Neocon Deputy US Defence Secretary, stalwart of theProject for the New American Century, and one of the main architects of the 2003invasion of Iraq. When a corruption scandal led to the departure of Wolfowitz,President Bush immediately nominated Sumerian-Khazar Robert Zoellick as hisreplacement. Zoellick is a Neocon insider connected to the Project for the NewAmerican Century and was another major architect of the Iraq invasion. He isalso a member of the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations andTrilateral Commission. The faces change, but nothing else.The International Monetary Fund is there to intervene when poor countries inAfrica, Asia and the rest of the developing world get into Illuminati-engineeredfinancial trouble. The idea has been to encourage and bribe politicians in thesecountries into relinquishing self-sufficiency in food and opening their lands tothe transnational giants. These countries then export ‘cash crops’ like cocoa tothe rich nations and use that money to pay for imported food from those samerich countries. They have also exported natural resources to the rich nations atknock-down prices and then bought back (at inflated prices) the products theindustrialised countries make with those resources. These products go to thetiny, corrupt, political and economic clique in these developing nations, whilethe majority of the population go hungry because the food-growing land isoccupied by the transnational corporations. The Reptilian hybrid policy has beento submerge poor countries in debt and take them over in the same way they didwith the industrialised nations. When these governments find themselves infinancial trouble and unable to meet their debt repayments, the IMF goes in to‘restructure’ the payments or offer more loans to pay the interest on theprevious ones. In return for imposing more debt, the IMF insists that itseconomic policies are followed. These involve, as I said earlier, cutting food,health and education subsidies and the exporting of more resources and cashcrops. When the IMF has told many countries to do this at the same time, it hascreated a glut on the world market for the commodities and the price hascollapsed. More is exported at the expense of food-growing land for the poor,but no more is earned. The winners are the transnational elite in the richnations who get their resources and commodities cheaper.As a result, you have the sight of hundreds of thousands of Brazilian childrendying through hunger-related disease when Brazil is one of the biggest foodexporters in the world. A third of the Brazilian population lives below thepoverty line and seven million abandoned children beg, steal, and sniff glue onthe streets. This in a country that should be among the most prosperous in theworld with no problem of feeding itself. Its problems are not natural. They are,like those throughout the ‘Third World’, manufactured for the benefit of theReptilian hybrids. Abundance and justice = freedom and choice; scarcity andinjustice = dependency and control. Every year, massively more wealth istransferred from poor countries to rich than goes the other way, and ‘overseasaid’ is not primarily aimed at helping developing countries. It is used to bribecorrupt politicians, build the infrastructure needed by the multinationals, orto subsidise industries in the rich countries, like Bechtel, who carry out thework as part of the aid deal. ‘Aid’ is a great way to transfer taxpayers’ moneyin a rich country to transnational corporations in the same country. The money‘given’ by the donor nation is often tied to projects that use the corporationsin the donor country. The money goes out from say the United States to anAfrican country in ‘aid’, and then most of it is paid back to United Statescorporations. There is no need for starvation and horrific suffering in Africa,Asia and Latin America. It is not the result of ‘natural disasters’, butcalculated design.The centralisation frenzy can be seen in the military with NATO and UN forcestaking over military command in regions of war and conflict, notably NATO inAfghanistan, which is way outside its original mandate for the defence of Europeand North America. I have been predicting this for years in my books, because itis where the agenda wants to go. UN military operations are involved in Lebanon,Sudan, Burundi, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Congo, Ethiopia, Western Sahara, Haiti,Timor-Leste, Georgia, Kosovo, Cyprus and elsewhere. This is part of the ‘tiptoe’to a world army to impose the policies of the world government. I have beenwriting for nearly twenty years that the plan was to merge the UN and NATOmilitaries into a global police force, and we are now seeing that day gettingcloser and closer. From this perspective, the more conflicts there are to‘peace-keep’, the quicker this process will be. I have heard it said that theprocess of centralisation in all areas of our lives is a ‘natural trend’, buthow can such blatant and constant manipulation by the same people and groups betermed ‘natural’.Image [../Images/00225.jpg]Figure 216: A typical political scene – darks suits everywhere. This is theBlair ‘Cabinet’ waiting to find out what was happening on the day that Bush andBlair invaded Iraq. No-one told them Centralised uniformityWherever you look, diversity of culture is being swamped by the ‘Western’ model.We may see this as the ‘American culture’ being imposed on the world, but‘America’ is just the vehicle. It is the Illuminati uniformity we are lookingat, hidden behind the guise of ‘America’. Dictatorships demand thecentralisation of decision making because the few cannot control the many whenthere is diversity and devolution of power. The more people that are involved inmaking choices, the less control there can be by the few over what is decided.Priority number one for any dictatorship is to crush diversity and imposecentralised uniformity. Look around the world today and you will see howindividuality and diversity are being targeted at every turn. Be it governmentstructure, the global ‘culture’ imposed through the transnational corporations,Hollywood and television, the off-the-peg building ‘design’ or clothing –everything is starting to look and act the same. I was sad to see a documentaryabout South African school children in which they wore the shirt and tieuniforms of the American and European model. It’s a small thing, you mightthink, but it was profoundly indicative of galloping uniformity. Africa has amagnificent cultural diversity in clothing and lifestyle, and yet it is beingconsumed by the boring banality of the universal blueprint. It is a clear andoften devastatingly simple process of cultural homicide. The idea is to getpeople to aspire to their oppressors’ culture. You sell your bland uniformity asthe symbol of ‘making it’ – proof that your targets have thrown off the shacklesof their primitive cultural ‘past’ and pulled up a chair at the table that onceoppressed them. ‘I’m one of you now, I got Nike trainers.’ Political leaders andother western wannabes have conceded their diversity to their own version of theschool uniform – the dark suit (Figure 216). The world is governed by men indark suits, be they politicians, bankers, businessmen, even the autocue readerswho deliver the ‘news’.> Good evening, this is Hugh Dark Suit with the Ten O’Clock News. At the White> House today President Dark Suit declared war on sanity, accompanied by another> man in a dark suit from the Pentagon. The British Prime Minister, Tony Dark> Suit, gave them his full support. Now we go over to our political> correspondents, John and Bill Dark Suit for the latest from Washington and> Westminster … Why do politicians in Africa, Central and South America, the Middle East, Chinaand so on, almost always wear the dark suit and tie – the ‘noose’ around theirnecks from Freemasonic ritual? It is not their historical culture and nor can itbe comfortable, especially for those in seriously hot countries. They do itbecause that is the way of the ‘West’ that they so crave to emulate. It meansthey have joined the big league, access by uniform and uniformity only. They usetheir media propaganda to sell the symbols of success and all those who want tobe seen as successful will aspire to those symbols, whether it’s the big house,big car, Nike trainers or dark suit. This is how the uniform agenda works andwith staggering efficiency. All of this is leading to a world government toreplace the United Nations, which itself is gathering more power all the timeand scheming for funding through global taxation. I have no problem with global‘umbrella bodies’ to coordinate between countries and encourage cooperation, butthat is not where this is heading. They don’t want cooperation, they wantcontrol and we are going to deeply regret it if we continue to buy thepropaganda about coming together as ‘One World’ when this is only Newspeak forglobal tyranny. Josef Stalin, the dictator of the Soviet Union, described whatis happening today in his 1942 book, Marxism and the National Question, and heshould know because he was a Reptilian hybrid serving his masters. He wrote:> Divide the world into regional groups as a transitional stage to world> government. Populations will more readily abandon their national loyalties to> a vague regional loyalty than they will for a world authority. Later, the> regionals can be brought all the way into a single world dictatorship. That’s the plan in forty-seven words, and it is unfolding with anever-quickening speed."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 21 Mirror, mirror on the wall …who is the most corrupt of all? > Be certain that he who has betrayed thee once will betray thee again. > Johann Kaspar Lavater One of the most important things to understand about the global conspiracy isthat it manipulates through all ‘sides’. If you control one side you influencethe game, but if you control both sides you control the game. The Reptilianhybrids are not interested in mere influence.This infiltration of all sides has been happening since ancient times toengineer wars, upheaval and Problem-Reaction-Solution scenarios. In the illusory‘free’ world of rigged ‘democracies’, the secret society network has placed itsinitiates and stooges into the positions of control in the major politicalparties, and many of the smaller ones, and this technique has been used to dupethe people into believing they are freely choosing their leaders. The‘multi-party’ states are illusions. There may appear to be different partiesunder different names, but they are the same one party state controlled from theshadows by the same elite. They change the party in government from time to timeto confirm that the public can choose who rules them, but, as I have stressed,no matter who you vote for the secret government still gets in.Among their most obvious techniques to fix elections is to infiltrate one mainparty with internal dissent and conflict and cause so much infighting and strifethat it is considered unelectable. This means, in our ‘free’ societies, thatwhoever leads the other major party is certain to become president or primeminister. They did this in Britain when the Illuminati wanted Margaret Thatcherin power during the 1980s. Mrs. Thatcher as a person was not an easy ‘sell’ tothe British people, but Illuminati agents within the Trade Union movementengineered massive industrial conflict, strikes and chaos in the so-called‘Winter of Discontent’ in 1978-79. Uncollected rubbish piled up in the streetsand in one area funerals were suspended when gravediggers refused to work. TheLabour Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, was forced to call an election in March1979, and he and his party were by now so unpopular that Margaret Thatcher sweptto victory pledging to curtail the power of the unions.Problem-Reaction-Solution. Despite her widespread unpopularity, she won threegeneral elections because the Labour Party was a seething mass of internalconflict throughout the decade and beyond. The two Labour leaders in that periodwere a nice, but by then aged and bewildered man called Michael Foot; and thebuffoon Neil Kinnock. For Thatcher, it was a breeze.She no doubt believed that it was down to her own brilliance and personality,but, all around her, the unseen hand was at work creating the circumstances thatwould ensure the introduction of the economic insanity called ‘Thatcherism’which, just a coincidence, was the same as the ‘Reaganomics’ of the Illuminati’sStateside pawn, Ronald Reagan, and his Vice-President and minder, Father GeorgeBush. The ‘Iron Lady’ was actually the naked empress manipulated by the ‘force’,while having her ego constantly fed and massaged so she believed that thedecisions of others were hers. One of her most significant ‘handlers’ was LordCarrington, her first Foreign Secretary and long-time chairman of the BilderbergGroup. Once Thatcher’s strident opposition to further European centralisationbecame a potential problem to the agenda, she was removed while still in officeby her own Conservative Party in 1990. The decision that she must go was takenat a meeting of the Bilderberg Group in 1989, as reported at the time byBilderberg watcher, Jim Tucker. When he published his report in the Spotlightnewspaper, Thatcher seemed impregnable, but she was only administering power –it was not in her gift to keep if the Reptilian hybrids decreed otherwise. Fromthat moment, her fate was sealed and the process of undermining her authorityand credibility began until she was forced to go. The same technique was used tocause conflict in the Conservative Party that allowed Tony Blair’s Labour Partyto have three terms in office. Presidents and prime ministers are only thepawns, not the kings and queens that they appear to be.I was saying for many years that Hillary Clinton would be a future Illuminaticandidate to run for President of the United States and she did so in 2008. But,as I add this updated text in November 2008, it is clear that the Illuminatiwanted another stooge in the White House called Barack Obama, the front-man forhis mentor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the co-founder with David Rockefeller of theTrilateral Commission. Obama is a product of the mob-controlled Chicagopolitical cesspit, one of the most corrupt on the planet, and the man is agigantic fraud. His many skeletons were overwhelmingly covered up to ensure hiselection and he was sold as the clean-cut family man who cares about the people.In fact, he’s just another puppet politician who will do whatever he is told todo to continue the Orwellian global agenda. He is potentially extremelyeffective for them because his ‘great oratory’ (reading someone else’s words onthe autocue like the actor he is) can sell fascism as power-to-the-people. Theenormous numbers in the United States and worldwide who have seen Obama assomething akin to a ‘messiah’ are going to be deeply disappointed as hispresidency unfolds. His massively-funded campaign was based on one word –change. This is a technique used by Bill Clinton and many others and it ishighly effective because, at any point, most people are not happy with the waylife is. So ‘change’ can be a potent message, even if, like Obama, you don’t saywhat it means. Unfortunately, because of the ludicrous hype surrounding him,Obama is going to be given a long honeymoon period before reality begins to dawnon the populous. People think that America is making a major change with itsfirst black President, but (a) he ultimately answers to the same masters as theBush family and (b) he is not there to represent black people because he iscontrolled by the white Illuminati cabal. Also, if they had him assassinated itwould tear American society apart. (See Appendix 1[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos2286593] on page 604, added in November2008, for more Obama background).Father George Bush was really the US President in the Reagan years. ‘Uncle Ron’was simply used to overcome Bush’s unpopularity at the polls and to exploit his‘acting’ skills to sell the policies, especially the invasions of Panama andGrenada and ‘Reaganomics’. Father Bush then rode the wave of Reagan popularityto win his own term in 1988 and this was followed by two terms of Bill Clintonand two for Boy George Bush. Now we have the Illuminati Brzezinski clone, BarackObama, in a country which claims to be so free and open that ‘anyone can becomepresident’. This is fantasy, because the Presidents of the United States sinceGeorge ‘Sun chair’ Washington in 1789 are largely from the same Reptilian hybridbloodlines as the royal and aristocratic families of Europe. They are notelected by ballot, but selected by blood, and manipulated into power by theReptilian hybrid secret society network.The first President, George Washington, the Grand Master of the Freemasons Lodgeat Alexandria, was from an aristocratic bloodline. One of his ancestors was anEnglish knight of the 12th century, the time the Templars were formed, andanother was a relative of the Duke of Buckingham who had fought for King CharlesIst in the English Civil War. The Reptilian hybrid presidential dynasty hascontinued ever since up to families like the Bushes and Clintons, who areextremely close associates. More recently, Father Bush and Pinocchio Bill havebecome public bosom buddies with Bush even speculating that he had become thefather that Clinton never had (Fig 217). We are told that Jeb Bush, the Neocongovernor for Florida, now calls Clinton ‘Bro’, and it’s all being portrayed as a‘new’ closeness between the families when they have been peas in the same podall along — just like the ‘Republican’ and ‘Democratic’ parties they claim torepresent. In this chapter, I am going to present just some of the background tothe Bush and Clinton families so you can see the kind of people who aremanipulated into high office and the connections between so-called political‘opponents’.The Bush crime familyThe Bushes have been one of the most active Illuminati families, at a ‘gofer’level, for at least the last hundred years, or so. They have produced two USpresidents and, compared with most, Father George is quite high in theIlluminati, although still small fry to the real brokers of power that you neversee. Father George and wife Barbara are both descendants of Godfroi de Bouillon(also known as Godfrey of Bouillon), the King of France and Duke of LowerLorraine, a major region for the Reptilian hybrid bloodline to this day, anddominated for centuries by the Reptilian hybrid Habsburg dynasty. The deBouillon bloodline is highly significant to the Illuminati. The Canada-basedhistorian, David Livingstone, author of The Dying God: The Hidden History ofWestern Civilization, says that the bloodlines forming the core of the rulingfamilies today descend from Guillaume de Gellone of the eighth century AD, theson of Rabbi Makhir, who was one of the ‘Exilarchs’ that ruled the Jews inBaghdad. Livingstone writes that Makhir went to France and changed his name toTheodoric before marrying an aunt of Charlemagne and being appointed ‘King ofthe Jews’ in the Languedoc region in southern France, where the ‘mysteriousvillage’ of Rennes-le-Chateau is located. The Languedoc capital, Narbonne,became the ‘heartland of the Medieval Kabbalah’, he says. It was from here thatthe Crusades appear to have been instigated, Livingtone contends, to retrievesacred texts buried there that were not accessible under Roman and Muslim ruleof Jerusalem. The Knights Templar led the excavations when they settled inJerusalem soon after they were formed, and discovered the text of the Sepher haBahir (the Book of Clear Light), he says. This ‘set off the cultural revolutionin the Medieval Kabbalah’. David Livingstone continues:> Part of this Kabbalistic revolution was the legends of the Holy Grail, which> included Cathar and Templar themes … The Holy Grail, or San Greal, should have> been translated as Sang Real, or Royal Blood, because it referred to the> sacred bloodline that supposedly issued from Guillaume de Gellone, and> ultimately King David, but which in reality, was understood to represent the> descendants of the Fallen Angels, and their leader, Lucifer. Image [../Images/00226.jpg]Figure 217: Bosom buddies – and always were Livingstone says that the Sinclairs/St Clairs, founders of the Knights Templar,are descendants of Guillaume de Gellone through his great-great-granddaughter,Poppa of Bavaria, who married the Viking leader, Rollo Ragnvaldsson, an ancestorof William the Conqueror of Normandy. William invaded Britain in the Battle ofHastings in 1066, after which a branch of the St Clairs located at Rosslyn inScotland to be known as the Sinclairs. They were later made Hereditary GrandMasters of the Masons of Scotland. The Scottish ‘royal’ bloodlines becameclosely associated with the Knights Templar, many of whom fled there after theTemplar purge in France. The bloodline came down through people like King DavidI of Scotland who married the grand-daughter of Lambert II, brother of Godefroide Bouillon, leader of the first crusade, and David’s sister, Mary Queen ofScots, married Godefroi’s younger brother. The Bush family also descends fromGodefroi de Bouillon who, in 1099, led European noblemen (‘Aryanmen’) in thesuccessful first Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the Muslims. He then movedinto the King’s palace at Temple Mount. De Bouillon was a direct descendant ofthe Merovingian kings and he was served by Hugh de Payens, the first GrandMaster of the Knights Templar. When Boy Bush, a descendant of de Bouillonthrough both his mother and father, talked of a ‘Crusade’ against Islamicterrorism after September 11th, he knew exactly what he was saying and why.Interestingly, one of the elite locations for Reptilian hybrid satanic ritualsis the Château des Amerois, known to researchers as the Mothers of DarknessCastle, and it is located in an area of Belgium called Bouillon, named afterthat family.Father George and Barbara Bush are from the Pierce bloodline that changed itsname from Percy after fleeing England in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot, whichwas officially led by Guy Fawkes to blow up the English Parliament and kill KingJames I in 1605. This event is still celebrated in the UK every November 5thwhen effigies of Guy Fawkes are burned on ritual bonfires all over the country.The Bush ancestor, Thomas Percy, was one of the main plotters. George andBarbara Pierce Bush (of Merrill, Lynch, Fenner and Smith) are from the samebloodline as the US President, Franklin Pierce, who was in the White House from1853 to 1857. Other Bush relatives include the Grosvenor families of England andAmerica, the Tafts of Ohio, who produced William Howard Taft, president from1909 to 1913, and the Delano-Roosevelts, who provided President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt (1933–45) and President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–09). The EnglishGrosvenors are the Dukes of Westminster who own prime properties in the City ofLondon, one of the main financial and secret society centres for the Illuminatiglobally. The Grosvenors of America founded the National Geographic which isnotorious for removing the archaeological treasures of the world, especiallythose with religious significance, and relocating them at the SmithsonianInstitute in Washington DC. The Institute is controlled by the Grosvenorcousins, the Smithsons, who in turn are descended from the Percys – the Piercebloodline that produced the Bushes. The Bush ancestry can be traced to England’sAlfred the Great and to Charlemagne, from whom thirty-four of the forty-three USpresidents are apparently descended. Boy Bush is related to every Europeanmonarch on and off the throne, and has ‘kinship’ with every member of Britain’sroyal family. He is a 13th cousin of Britain’s Queen Mother, who died in 2002 atthe age of 101, and her daughter Queen Elizabeth. Bush is a 13th cousin, onceremoved, of the heir to the throne Prince Charles, and has a direct descent fromHenry III and from Henry VIII’s sister, Mary Tudor, who was also the wife ofLouis XI of France. Bush is further descended from Charles II of England. GaryBoyd Roberts is a genealogist at the New England Historic Genealogical Societyin Boston and one of the foremost authorities on the royal ancestry of Americanpresidents. He has confirmed that George W. Bush is descended from Britishroyalty going as far back as the 12th century to King Henry I, the son ofWilliam the Conqueror. William invaded Britain from France and won the Battle ofHastings in 1066, supported by the St Clair family that later located to RoslynCastle and Chapel, near Edinburgh.It is worth mentioning, too, that Hitler’s former bodyguard, Otto Skorenzy,apparently claimed in a deathbed ‘confession’ in 1999, supported by a box ofphotographs going back 60 years, that the whole Bush family story is a sham. Hesaid that Boy Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, was actually a German associateof people like Martin Borman, Hitler’s second in command; Reinhardt Gehlen, achief SS officer recruited by the CIA after the war; and Josef Mengele, theconcentration camp ‘Angel of Death’. Skorenzy said that Prescott Bush’s realname was George H. Scherff Sr, who went to the United States with the specificjob of representing Nazi interests. It is further claimed that Scherff targetedthe scientific genius, Nikola Tesla, became his ‘trusted assistant’, and stolehis research and inventions. Skorenzy said that Father George Bush was reallyGeorge H. Scherff Jr, the teenage boy who Tesla dubbed ‘Curious George’ afterfinding him stealing items from his laboratory. Some things are provable fact:George Scherff Sr was connected to the Rockefellers and Nikola Tesla; PrescottBush, his alleged alias, was a major source of funding for the Nazis from theUnited States; the Bush and Scherff family records detailing their history areeither missing or blatantly contradictory; the records in the National Archivesrelating to Samuel Prescott Bush, the alleged father of Prescott Bush, weredestroyed ‘to save space’; and large numbers of German nationals were sent tothe United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to manipulate andcontrol American society, not least through the creation of the Federal Reserveand hijacking the American intelligence network that culminated in the formationof the CIA. Tens of thousands of former Nazis also came to the United Statesafter the Second World War, including Otto Skorenzy, Hitler’s bodyguard.Skorenzy claimed in his deathbed story that he and Reinhardt Gehlen murderedTesla so the Nazis on both sides of the Atlantic could get access to highlyadvanced technology. You can read the detailed research and make up your ownmind on all this by going to the coverups archive at www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com] and clicking the headline: ‘Deathbed “confessions”about the German origins of the Bush family’. Interestingly, for someone soclosely connected to Hitler and the Nazis, the name Scherf, with one ‘f’, isAshkenazi Jewish, the same as Paul Warburg who was behind the Federal Reserve,and the Rothschild associate Jacob Schiff, who ran the German Ashkenazi Kuhn,Loeb and Company that funded the Russian Revolution and other Illuminatioperations. The Skull and Bones Society, so beloved of the Bush family, is alsoof German origin.The Bush family drug networkThe Bush family behave like typical Reptilian hybrids, obsessed with power andwealth, and enough is never enough no matter how much they have. They areheavily involved in the drug trade that has put heroin and cocaine on thestreets of America and around the world. Drug running is one of the manyconnections the Bushes have with the Clintons. It was very wealthy aristocraticand other Reptilian hybrid families in Britain and the United States thatlaunched the global drug trade and still control it. They use their governmentagencies to ‘bust’ any opposition and leave the field clear for themselves. Thisis what is happening when you hear news reports of a ‘big drug find’ or somevillain or network being jailed for trafficking. The real players never getcaught because they also control law ‘enforcement’. The Illuminati drug-runningnetwork not only makes vast sums to fund its covert projects, it also destroyslives on a massive scale, and creates fear and divide and rule through thedivision and crime generated by those who steal, rob and mug in a desperateattempt to get the money to feed their addiction. The Skull and Bones Society,alongside Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is also involved. It isowned by the Russell Trust, an organisation controlled by the drug-runningRussell family, which has been genetically-connected to Bill Clinton byresearcher Fritz Springmeier in his book, Bloodlines of the Illuminati.Springmeier says the Russells are a German Jewish (Khazar/Sumerian) family,originally spelt ‘Roessel’, who migrated to Scotland. The Russells flew theskull and bones flag on their ships as they transported drugs for the BritishEmpire from Turkey to China and elsewhere during the Opium Wars of the 19thcentury. These were engineered by Lord Palmerston, the British Prime Minister,Foreign Secretary and Rothschild agent. Samuel Russell launched Russell andCompany in 1823 and within seven years it had absorbed the Perkins opiumsyndicate based in Boston. Russell’s head of operations in Canton, China, wasWarren Delano Jr, the grandfather of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the US Presidentduring the Second World War, who was related to the Bush family. Roosevelt wasalso a cousin of his fellow wartime leader, British Prime Minister WinstonChurchill. Other famous families (Reptilian hybrid bloodlines) were partners inthe Russell drug network – names like Coolidge, Forbes, Perkins, Low andSturgis.The horrific world of Father GeorgeBush the elder was groomed from birth to serve the Illuminati in a long list ofroles, including US Ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the RepublicanParty at the time of the Watergate hearings, Director of the CIA andVice-President and President of the United States. The Herbert Walker in hisname comes from his grandfather, George Herbert Walker (Skull and BonesSociety), another man involved with Prescott Bush in the manipulation of theRussian Revolution, the expansion of the eugenics movement and the funding ofHitler. The golf trophy called the Walker Cup is named after him. Wherever youlook in Father Bush’s life you find Illuminati operatives, human sacrificers,child abusers and orchestrators of genocide. Bush, himself, is all of these, asmy books and others have well detailed – see The Biggest Secret and Children ofthe Matrix. Bush served the Illuminati in China while Secretary of State HenryKissinger and the Chinese were supporting Pol Pot in the genocidal war onCambodia that led to the systematic extermination of millions of Cambodians. Hereturned home in 1975 when he received a telegram from Kissinger saying that hewas being nominated by President Ford (Kissinger) to be Director of the CentralIntelligence Agency. Bush held the post in 1976 and 1977, and he is sofundamentally involved in CIA activities that in 1999 its headquarters compoundat Langley, Virginia, was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence. Thelegislation authorising this was signed by Bush associate, Bill Clinton. The CIAis part of what is called the ‘Inner Fed’ of the secret government that consistsof the CIA, the National Security Agency (NSA), FBI, NASA and the FederalReserve, the ‘central bank of America’. It is through ‘umbrella’ structures likethe ‘Inner Fed’ – the pyramids – that a coordinated policy and response can beconducted between apparently unconnected agencies and organisations. Much of thefunding of this cartel of manipulation comes from its involvement in the drugtrade, which the CIA and bloodline families like the Bushes control, togetherwith British and other ‘intelligence’ networks. The Clintons are right in therewith them, too.Father Bush was not new to the intelligence game when he became head of the CIA,and his connections with the agency would appear to go back to the 1950s, oreven much earlier given the Skull and Bones Society connection to the USintelligence community. In his book, The Immaculate Deception, Russell S. Bowennames Bush as a top CIA agent since before the agency’s failed Bay of Pigsinvasion of Cuba in 1961, which turned President Kennedy’s attention toreforming the agency. Bowen, a retired brigadier general who did some of theBush family’s dirty work, says that Bush worked with a man called FelixRodriguez and other anti-Castro Cubans. Rodriguez would turn up again in theIran–Contra arms-for-drugs scandal during the Reagan–Bush administration, whichmade enormous quantities of hard drugs available in the United States.Intriguingly, the top secret code name of the Bay of Pigs invasion was‘Operation Zapata’ and Father Bush’s oil company was called Zapata Oil. CIAdocuments have since come to light to confirm that it was Bush and CIA agent,Thomas J. Devine, who established the Zapata Oil company in the 1950s. Thisexposed the lie constantly repeated by Bush that he had no connection to theagency before 1976. Devine operated under cover in commercial projects in theUnited States and Europe that were fronts for the CIA and part of a projectcode-named WUBRINY. He was employed at the time by the Wall Street firm, Train,Cabot and Associates, which was described in CIA memos as an ‘investment bankingfirm which houses and manages the [CIA] proprietary corporation WUSALINE’.Devine accompanied Father Bush, then recently elected to Congress, on a two-weektrip to Vietnam where the CIA ran a drug-running operation that covered thewhole of South East Asia.When you look at the personnel in the ‘Plumbers Group’ involved in the Watergatebreak-in in 1972, a remarkable number of them were also involved in the Bay ofPigs debacle. William Buckley, a CIA coordinator, said that if he told what heknew about the Bay of Pigs and the Kennedy assassination ‘it would be thebiggest scandal ever to rock the nation’. Buckley would later be assassinated inthe Middle East. Father George Bush has been a long-time CIA asset since beforethe Kennedy assassination when family friend and Hitler supporter, Allen Dulles,was head of the CIA. The Dulles family are a Reptilian hybrid bloodline andcousins to the Rockefellers. President Kennedy sacked Dulles in a purge in whichhe threatened to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces, but before he could dothat he was assassinated in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, in 1963. The same Allen Dulleswas appointed to the Warren Commission to decide who killed him! There isevidence to suggest that Father Bush was far closer to the Kennedy assassinationthan people have believed. Released FBI files include a memo from the diabolicalBureau director, J. Edgar Hoover, saying that they had given a briefing to twomen in the intelligence community on November 23rd 1963, the day after theassassination. The memo refers to one as ‘Mr. George Bush of the CentralIntelligence Agency’, and the other as ‘Captain William Edwards of the DefenseIntelligence Agency’. When this was exposed, we were told to believe that ‘Mr.George Bush’ referred to a low-ranked coast and landing-beach analyst. Yeah,sure it did.After his appointment to head the CIA in 1976, Father Bush ran a globaldrug-running operation from his office in Langley, Virginia. Among his chosenoperatives was Theodore Shackley, whom Bush named as the CIA’s associate deputydirector for covert operations. Shackley had been the head of the CIA station inMiami during the early 1960s, from where E. Howard Hunt and his fellow Watergateburglars would emerge. Shackley went on to head the CIA station in Saigon duringthe Vietnam War where he masterminded Operation Phoenix. This involved the deathof tens of thousands of Vietnamese civilians who were ‘suspected’ of working forthe Viet-Cong. Oliver North, the ‘star’ of the Iran–Contra arms-for-drugsscandal during the Reagan–Bush administration, worked with Shackley on OperationPhoenix, which is reputed to have murdered 40,000 Vietnamese villagers. Shackleyran a huge assassination and drug operation in South East Asia in the 1970s inwhich two other Bush men, Donald Gregg and Felix Rodriguez, were involved. Sowas Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State to Colin Powell at the time of9/11. Powell described Armitage in his book, My American Journey, as ‘my brotherand my bodyguard’. The drug operation in South East Asia was threatened whenPresident Kennedy sought to withdraw from Vietnam, the Illuminati war that costthe lives of 50,000 Americans and two million Vietnamese. After Kennedy’sassassination, the war was expanded, along with the drug trafficking. Bushappointed the same Theodore Shackley to an important position in his CIA in 1976and Shackley would later be recruited as Bush’s speechwriter during the 1979–80election campaign. The idea that someone like Shackley would be hired to writeBush’s speeches defies the imagination and no doubt his other ‘talents’ were thereal reason for his presence. Shackley later lived in Medellin, Colombia, homeof the drug cartel that interlocks with the CIA operation. Thomas Clines, aformer second in command at the CIA station in Miami, was another Bush appointeeat the CIA who would be involved in Iran–Contra, a scandal Bush was to say heknew nothing about. During Bush’s tenure at the CIA, the operatives knew theycould do virtually as they liked, because their director had a gift for lookingthe other way.The power over US intelligence operations was concentrated in Bush’s hands as aresult of a series of measures introduced by President Ford, a front man for themob, and his Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller. Both were installed without anelection by the Kissinger–manipulated Watergate affair that forced Richard Nixonto resign. In the words of The New York Times, Ford: ‘… centralized more powerin the hands of the Director of Central Intelligence than any had had since thecreation of the CIA’. Among Bush’s CIA operatives in South America was the Nazi‘Butcher of Lyon’, Klaus Barbie, who had escaped from Europe thanks to Britishand US intelligence and the networks of the Church of Rome. It was Barbie whomasterminded the ‘cocaine-coup’ in Bolivia in 1980, and he used the profits fromCIA–supported drug networks to finance the neo- Nazi overthrow of the governmentin Argentina. According to former US Drug Enforcement agent, Mike Levine, thiscoup was achieved by troops wearing Nazi armbands. Another Illuminati frontoperation closely connected to Father Bush is Sun Myung Moon’s ‘Moonie Church’,which was funded into existence by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Bo HiPak, Moon’s right-hand man, was among the first to arrive in La Paz after theBarbie–Bush ‘cocaine-coup’ in Bolivia. Moon, it is claimed, invested $4 millionin the coup and was to help finance Bush’s run for the presidency in 1988. TheWashington Times newspaper, so supportive of the Bush family, is owned by Moon,and the Secretary General of the United Nations is the South Korean Ban Ki- Moonwho has been linked to the Moonies by some researchers.Reagan–Bush (Bush–Reagan)The contacts Father Bush made at the CIA would be invaluable when he becameVice- President to Ronald Reagan on January 2Ist 1981. Reagan’s personal fortunedated from a time, shortly after becoming Governor of California, when he boughtsome land cheaply and sold it at an enormous profit to a group of benefactorswho have never been publicly identified. Reagan, a former B-movie actor, was along-time member of Bohemian Grove and an initiate of the Knights of Malta. Hewas seventy, the oldest man to be inaugurated as President. His mind wasfailing, he needed long afternoon naps each day, and almost everything he said,even in relatively off-the-cuff situations when greeting foreign leaders, waswritten for him on cue cards by his aides. Father George Bush was president inall, but name. Reagan’s mind further deteriorated after the assassinationattempt in 1981 by John Hinckley, who had connections to the Bush family. Thisgave Bush almost complete control of affairs and in the background was the powerbehind the throne, his mentor, Henry Kissinger, who has been controlling eventseven since he officially left public office. The CIA scientist with the ‘patch’on his chest told me that he was summoned to the White House during the FatherBush presidency and when he walked into the Oval Office there was Kissinger –even though officially he had no role in that administration. The scientist saidthat Kissinger sat in the President’s chair and ran the whole meeting while Bushjust nodded. This is what happens with virtually all major governments. Thosewho seem to have the power are controlled by ‘advisors’ and manipulators thepublic never hears about. Boy Bush and Tony Blair are perfect examples.Father George built a network of organisations within the government withhimself at the head (on behalf of others). These were the Standing Crisis,Pre-Planning Group, the Crisis Management Center, the Terrorist Incident WorkingGroup, the Task Force on Combating Terrorism and the Operations Sub-Group. Thesewere subordinate to, and controlled by, the Special Situation Group chaired byBush. If ever there was a line-up of Problem-Reaction-Solution organisations,this was it. Through this network would come the arms-for-drugs operation knownas Iran–Contra in which the Reagan–Bush administration illegally sold arms tothe hostile regime in Iran (hostile in public anyway), and used the money theyreceived to illegally fund and arm the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua. TheContras were fighting to overthrow the elected Sandinista government that theIlluminati wanted removed. In return for this vital support, the Contrassupplied US government agencies, controlled by Father Bush, with drugs fordistribution on the streets of America and elsewhere. Iran–Contra was about morethan selling arms to fund a bloody rebellion in Nicaragua. It was also designedto flood the streets with addictive drugs to target young people, divide societyand raise fantastic amounts of money to fund other covert projects.Running drugs from the White HouseThe now Vice-President Bush, and President in fact, hired his former CIAassociate and drug-runner Donald P. Gregg as his main adviser on ‘nationalsecurity’. Gregg brought with him a ‘former’ CIA assassinations manager, thedrug-runner Felix Rodriguez, whom Bush had known back to the time of the Bay ofPigs invasion and his period as head of the CIA. Gregg and Rodriguez wereinvolved with Theodore Shackley in the assassination and drug-running operationin South East Asia during the Vietnam War, and the two now worked out of GeorgeBush’s White House office. It was strictly illegal under US law for thegovernment to supply arms to Iran, or to fund and arm the Nicaraguan ‘freedomfighters’ (terrorists) called the Contras in their war with the Sandinistagovernment. It was certainly illegal to accept payment with drugs in return. TheReagan–Bush administration would do all of these things. One of the ways theBush-controlled ‘Reagan’ government secretly undermined the Sandinistas was bymining harbours in Nicaragua. Again, Father Bush’s close friend Shackley wasinvolved. The bombs planted in the harbours of Nicaragua caused a major row inthe US and the laws forbidding such actions, the Boland Laws as they werecalled, were further strengthened. But, at a secret meeting of the NationalPlanning Group on June 25th 1984, Bush, Reagan and their top officials decidedto ignore the law. They would fund the Contras through Honduras, just as theyhad used El Salvador against the Sandinistas. Bush and Oliver North, an officialof the National Security Council, travelled together to El Salvador. On January18th 1985, the Bush-appointed Felix Rodriguez is known to have met his namesake(but not thought to be a relative), Ramon Milian Rodriguez, an accountant andmoney launderer who worked for the Medellin drug cartel. This meeting wasconfirmed by Ramon Rodriguez and reported in the Miami Herald on June 30th 1987.From his prison cell in Butner, North Carolina, Ramon told investigativejournalist, Martha Honey:> … [Felix offered] … in exchange for money for the Contra cause he would use> his influence in high places to get the [cocaine] cartel US goodwill …> Frankly, one of the selling points was that he could talk directly to Bush.> The issue of goodwill wasn’t something that was going to go through> twenty-seven bureaucratic hands. It was something that was directly between> him and Bush. This could easily be done given that Felix Rodriguez was working from Bush’soffice. A memo in early September 1986 sent to Oliver North by retired ArmyMajor General John K. Singlaub said that Felix Rodriguez was talking of having‘daily contact’ with Bush’s office and this, said the memo, could damagePresident Reagan and the Republican Party. Oliver North would also write in hisnotebook: ‘Felix has been talking too much about the VP [Vice-President]’. Inher 1987 book, Out Of Control, former CBS News producer, Leslie Cockburn,presents devastating evidence of Bush’s involvement in Iran–Contra and drugtrafficking operations. She says that planes chartered by the CIA and packedwith cocaine flew directly into the Homestead Air Force Base in Florida using aCIA code signal. Colonel Albert Carone, who was later murdered, said in a swornstatement that he remembered seeing Oliver North make more than twenty entriesin his diary detailing how drug profits were being used to buy weapons for theContras. He said that an entry for July 5th 1985 noted that ‘$14 million to buyarms came from drugs’. In 1986, the Reagan–Bush administration admitted thatAdolfo ‘Popo’ Chamorro’s Nicaraguan Contras, the terrorists supported by theCIA, were helping a Colombian drug-trafficker to transport drugs into the UnitedStates. The testimony of John Stockwell, a former high-ranking CIA official,revealed that drug smuggling was an essential component of the CIA operationwith the Contras. George Morales, one of South America’s biggest traffickers,testified that he was approached in 1984 to fly weapons to the Contras. Inreturn, he says, the CIA helped him to smuggle thousands of kilos of cocaineinto the United States via an airstrip on the ranch of John Hull, aself-confessed CIA agent and associate of Oliver North. As Michael Ruppert, aformer drugs specialist with the Los Angeles Police Department, said:> The CIA and Ronald Reagan and [CIA Director] Bill Casey and Vice-President> George Bush were running the whole operation, we know that now. They> circumvented the will of Congress and there was an explosion of drug> trafficking all throughout Central America, coordinated by the CIA. Another man at the very heart of the drug operation and the murderous attacks onNicaragua was the Reptilian hybrid, John Negroponte, the US Ambassador toHonduras and member of the Project for the New American Century. It became knownin his time there as ‘USS Honduras’ with American ‘aid’ increasing from $4million a year to $77 million. Negroponte had been appointed to the AmericanEmbassy in Vietnam from 1964, just as the Vietnam War and the CIA’s South EastAsia drug operation escalated. He was an advisor to the war criminal HenryKissinger and in charge of Vietnam policy on the US National Security Council.In the 1980s Negroponte carried out the covert Reagan–Bush policy to destroy theelected Sandinista government in Nicaragua from his base in Honduras. He wasfundamentally involved with the infamous Battalion 3-16 that ran a terrorcampaign of murder and torture against civilians. He later became US Ambassadorto the United Nations at the time of 9/11, arguing for the invasion ofAfghanistan; head of government operations in Iraq after the invasion; the firstDirector of National Intelligence, a post created through Boy Bush to centralisepower over all US intelligence agencies; he then became Deputy Secretary ofState.The other aspect of Iran–Contra was to illegally trade arms for Americanhostages held in Iran. Oliver North was again involved in the supply of arms toIran, via Israel, in return for hostages. The release of the hostages wasexplained in part by the efforts of Terry Waite, the representative of Britain’sArchbishop of Canterbury, who was negotiating the release of hostages, orthought he was. Waite was being used without his knowledge by North who wasquite happy for him to take the credit for the release of hostages when, infact, they were the result of illegal arms sales. As a consequence, Waite wouldeventually be taken hostage himself. Throughout this whole period George Bushwas telling the American people: ‘We will make no concessions to terrorists’ –just as his son has said.The cover-upIn late 1986, the Iran–Contra scandal blew and Ronald Reagan had to admit some,but only some, of what was happening. He said: ‘A few months ago I told theAmerican people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my bestintentions still tell me that is true but the facts and evidence tell me it isnot’. (I lied.) On October 5th, a plane had left the Ilopango Air Base in ElSalvador with arms and ammunition for the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua. Theflight had been coordinated by officials within George Bush’s office. As theplane came low to make the drop, it was grounded by a Sandinista missile. Threepeople died in the crash, but cargo handler Eugene Hasenfus parachuted into thehands of the Sandinistas. Bush was alerted in a call to his office bydrug-runner and assassin, Felix Rodriguez. The truth was out, or some of it was.The power of the Illuminati network can be the only explanation for how, despitethe overwhelming evidence against him, Bush evaded prosecution – even though BuzSawyer, the pilot of the crashed plane, was found to have the private phonenumber of George Bush’s office in his pocket! Hasenfus also stated that GeorgeBush knew about the whole thing, but Bush denied any involvement or knowledge ofwhat happened, and subordinates like Donald Regan, Admiral John Poindexter,Oliver North, Robert McFarlane and Major General Richard Secord were sacrificedand scapegoated. They were very much involved, of that there is no doubt, butBush got away with it, as did Reagan and his Secretary of Defense CasperWeinberger, who was pardoned by Bush to ensure he would not face trial. Thepardon came on Christmas Eve 1992 in the dying days of his presidency, after hehad lost the November election to Bill Clinton and a matter of weeks beforeWeinberger and company were due to face a trial that would have implicated Bush.Oliver North, who was up to his eyes in the intrigue, faced hearings with otherscapegoats and staggeringly emerged in the eyes of many as an American hero.Former government mind-slave, Cathy O’Brien, tells in her book, Trance-Formationof America, how she observed one drug party attended by Oliver North, Air Forceofficials and their wives and drug barons like the Puerto Rican, Jose Busto.Large amounts of cocaine were laid out for their use. Upstairs was ManuelNoriega, the then president of Panama, who was on the CIA payroll under FatherBush’s direction to run drugs through Panama on their way from South America tothe United States. It was only when Noriega stopped taking orders from Bush thatAmerican troops invaded Panama in 1989 to remove him and install new leadersconnected to the Colombian drug cartel. Bush told the American people that theinvasion, which killed a large number of civilians, was necessary to stopNoriega’s drug activities. These people have no shame.One reporter, the late Gary Webb on the San Jose Mercury News, did have the gutsto expose how the CIA and the Bush-controlled White House had poured crackcocaine into black areas to raise money for the Contras and destroy blackcommunities. When he did so, Webb and his newspaper were not only attacked bythe authorities, but by their fellow ‘journalists’ and major papers like theReptilian hybrid-controlled Washington Post, New York Times, and Los AngelesTimes. You can see that, if you control all sides, it is actually possible tocoordinate a drug-running and arms-running operation from the White House andget away with it. When you have your people in government carrying out theseoperations; your people controlling law ‘enforcement’ and heading any‘inquiries’ should you get caught; and your people owning the media, it is notas difficult as it may at first appear. There is so much more to tell about theBush family, their murders, wars, Satanism, and corruption beyond belief, andyou find the details in my other books like The Biggest Secret. I havehighlighted the drug connection here to give you a feel for how the networkoperates and the links between apparently unconnected countries and people.The Clinton Crime FamilyIn January 1993, Father George Bush (Council on Foreign Relations, TrilateralCommission, Skull and Bones Society, 33rd degree Freemason, and ‘Republican’),was replaced in the White House by Bill Clinton (Council on Foreign Relations,Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Rhodes Scholar, 33rd degree Freemason,Order of DeMolay and ‘Democrat’). The One Party State rolled on, as it alwaysdoes when governments ‘change’. The Bush and Clinton families answer to the samemasters and they worked together on the drug trafficking operation through theMena airstrip in Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor. Cathy O’Briendescribes in Trance-Formation of America how she met the Clintons a number oftimes, and on one occasion Bill was trying to persuade a supporter called BillHall to get involved in his drug operation. Clinton said Hall didn’t have toworry because it was ‘Reagan’s operation’ and Cathy quotes him as saying:> Bottom line is, we’ve got control of the [drug] industry, therefore we’ve got> control of them [suppliers and buyers]. You control the guy underneath you and> Uncle [Uncle Sam, the United States Government] has you covered. What have you> got to lose? No risk. No one’s going to hang you out to dry. And whatever> spills off the truck as it passes through [Clinton laughed here and snorted> another nose-full of cocaine] you get to clean up. It was, indeed, business as usual when the ‘Democrat’ replaced the ‘Republican’,and it will be so when it happens again in this bloodline version of musicalchairs. Cathy O’Brien says she met Father Bush and Clinton together in the1980s, years before Clinton was even considered a presidential possible. Sheonce observed them at an Illuminati base called Swiss Villa at Lampe, Missouri,where there was a CIA ‘near-death trauma centre’ known as ‘the infirmary’. Thiswas used to torture mind-slaves as part of their programming. Cathy, under hermind-control, had delivered a large amount of cocaine in a motorhome when shesaw Bush and Clinton together:> … I noticed then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, at a corner table with> Hillary talking to the then Vice-President George Bush, and their two special> forces ‘toy soldiers’ [mind-controlled soldiers] who had transferred the> cocaine to the infirmary building. My mind-control owner, US Senator, Robert> Byrd, told me that Bush and others had been grooming Bill Clinton for the> presidency ‘in the event that the American public becomes disillusioned with> Republicans and believe that electing a Democrat would make a difference’.> Clinton obediently followed Bush’s orders. Since the implementation of what> Hitler termed New World Order knew no party lines, the question should be> raised as to the agenda of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign manager, James> Carville, and his wife Mary Matalin, who was Bush’s campaign manager. You will find the same story all over the world. Clinton may have been a‘Democrat’, but he answered to the ‘Republican’ Father George Bush and wasanother bloodline representative of the Reptilian hybrids. I have seenresearchers connect Clinton’s bloodline to Baldwin of Bouillon, the brother ofthe Bush ancestor and Crusade leader, Godfroi de Bouillon. Christian author andresearcher J. R. Church writes:> Bill Clinton’s family goes back to William Henry Harrison and Benjamin> Harrison, making him related to Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. His kinship to> Ford makes him ‘near kin’ to Richard Nixon and George Bush. Small world, isn’t> it? Church says that he met with a man in the summer of 1996 who claimed to be adescendant of the Rothschilds. He told Church that Bill Clinton attended theirfamily functions as a boy:> This man grew up in the same town with Clinton. They attended the same> schools. He would see Bill at family get-togethers wearing a Jewish skullcap.> According to him, Bill Clinton is a descendant of the Rothschild family. He> said the rabbis would kiss his hand and refer to him as the Segulah Yeled> Eklatosh – the ‘royal-boy-chosen’. The covert ‘king’Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III in Hope, Arkansas, and was broughtup in Hot Springs. His official father died in a car accident before he was bornand his mother married a guy called Roger Clinton, the name Slick Will adoptedat the age of 14. The records of his official father appear to have been ‘lost’,as were those of Adolf Hitler, another possible Rothschild bloodline – seeChildren of the Matrix – and so many documents relating to Bush family history.There have also been reports that Clinton is actually the son of WinthropRockefeller, a governor of Arkansas, and he has certainly enjoyed the support ofthe Rockefeller manipulation machine. David Rockefeller, America’s ‘Kingmaker’,had met with Clinton in the mid-1980s at Winrock, the farm built by WinthropRockefeller. It is common practice for major Reptilian hybrid families to seedchildren who are then brought up by another family under another name. They havesperm banks that allow them to produce literally thousands of children. If everypresident or prime minister was a Rothschild or Rockefeller the plot wouldhardly be difficult to expose and this is the way they get around that. It meansthat there are many Reptilian hybrid ‘royals’ out there who do not appear to beso from their official genealogy. It is important to understand that it is notthe name that matters, but the bloodline.Bill Clinton had to be bloodline to be given the Rhodes scholarship to OxfordUniversity and the political support he enjoyed from an early age. He becameGovernor of Arkansas at just thirty-two and, at forty-six, the third youngestPresident of the United States. He knew from the start what was required forpolitical advancement and he said in an interview in 1994 that he knew from thebooks of Carroll Quigley, his tutor at the Jesuit Georgetown University, that apermanent shadow government of bankers and government officials existed whichcontrolled the political agenda from behind the scenes. He said that, whilestill a young man, he realised that it was necessary for him to gain access tothis inner circle if he was to become part of the decision-making process thatshapes the world. In fact, he would already have known he had been chosen to dojust that. He was another product of the Reptilian hybrid production line ofpresidents – easily manipulated, knows how to take orders and with a mountain ofunpleasant information about him waiting to be revealed if he steps out of line.‘We’ll give them a Democrat president this time, just to let them think theystill have a choice.’ Arkansas is a big centre for the Reptilian operation. TheScottish Rite of US Freemasonry has a major presence there and it was from thisand other organisations that the Ku Klux Klan emerged. The Klan’s emblem issimilar to a Maltese Cross, the same as the Knights of Malta and the Knights ofthe Golden Circle, which played a major role in the Rothschild manipulation ofthe American Civil War. The Ku Klux Klan is the old Knights of the Golden Circleunder another name, controlled by the same force. According to the Germanmagazine Neue Solidarität, the guru and foster-father of Bill Clinton was ParsonWo Vaught, a 32nd degree initiate in the Scottish Rite. Clinton is a member ofmany secret societies, including the Freemason-controlled Order of DeMolay (alsoDeMolay International) which claims allegiance to the martyred Knights Templarleader, Jacques de Molay, who was arrested and later burned in the Templar purgein France in the early 14th century.Staggering corruptionClinton was supported in his life of breathtaking corruption in Arkansas by hiswife Hillary at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. They had met while lawstudents at Yale and their sham marriage has served both extremely well in theirgluttonous pursuit of power. Bill Clinton sat in the middle of a complex networkof drug running, money laundering and general corruption when he became Arkansasgovernor. A close associate, and his biggest financial backer when he ran forpresident, was Jackson Stephens, one of the founders of the Bank of Credit andCommerce International, or ‘BCCI’. This was the global money laundering, drugrunning and terrorist-funding operation involving the CIA, which collapsed amidenormous controversy and loss of customers’ money in 1991. The Citizens forHonest Government organisation produced an investigative video into BillClinton’s background and they interviewed a former friend of Clinton in theArkansas days, Larry Nichols. It would appear that Clinton thought Nichols couldbe trusted to keep quiet and take the perks. He gave him the job of marketingdirector of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA). It was astate-run operation created by Clinton to, he said publicly, invest tax money inlow interest bond loans to local businesses, colleges, schools and churches. Hesaid it would ‘stimulate jobs’, one of the excuses you hear all the time tojustify the latest Illuminati fast-one. When Larry Nichols took up his post, hesaw the truth. He said:> … I’d been there about a month and I realised that I was at the epicentre of> what I’d always heard about all my life … I was literally working, sitting, in> the middle of Bill Clinton’s political machine. It was where he made his pay> offs, where he repaid favours to people for campaign support. I was in an> interesting seat and I knew it. If you needed a million dollars, you had to> get your application handled by the [Hillary Clinton] Rose Law Firm and pay> them $50,000. There were five other companies in the state of Arkansas that> were actually more qualified in bond structuring and applications, but the> Rose Law Firm got ‘em all. > I started checking around, and I kept asking … the comptroller, Bill Wilson …> how did people make payments on these loans? He looked at me and said: ‘They> don’t’. He thought I knew. Well, that blew my mind. And this is about two> months in. It was getting tough then. So I started gathering documents. After> everybody left I would stick around as if I was working on the annual report.> That would give me access to the documents and I made copies of them all. Nichols established that Bill Clinton’s Arkansas Development Finance Authoritywas laundering drug money. ADFA was also a front for giving loans to hisbusiness friends, who would then fund his election expenses. Jackson Stephenshad advanced the Clinton presidential campaign $2.8 million and less than twoyears earlier his bank had earned a profit on a transaction involving studentloans controlled by Bill Clinton. The size of the profit? $2.8 million. Nicholswent on:> There was a hundred million a month in cocaine coming in and out of Mena> [airstrip] in Arkansas. They had a problem … you create a problem in a little> state like Arkansas. How do you clean one hundred million dollars a month?> ADFA until 1989 never banked in Arkansas. What they would do is … ship the> money down to … a bank in Florida which would later be connected to BCCI. They> would ship money to a bank in Georgia, which was … later connected to the> BCCI. They’d ship to Citicorp in New York, which would send the money> overseas. At the centre of this operation was Clinton’s closest friend, Dan Lasater, whowould be jailed with his brother, Roger Clinton, for cocaine offences. DocDelaughter, the police investigator in charge of the Lasater case, said hegathered detailed statements from people connected with Clinton’s friend and hisuse of drugs to get young girls hooked and under his control for sexual favours.The police officer revealed how he suffered harassment from his own policedepartment during his investigation and, he said, he knew that was because ofthe connection between the state police and Governor Clinton’s office. Like Isay, the Reptilian hybrids control the system by controlling all ‘sides’.Lasater spent less than a year in a minimum security prison for his drugoffences and when he was released Clinton granted him a full pardon. Legislationenacted by Governor Clinton helped Tyson Foods to become the biggest company inthe state. The owner, Don Tyson, was given $10 million by ADFA and never paid acent of it back. He did, however, put $700,000 into Clinton’s election campaign.Police officer Doc Delaughter said he had enough evidence on Tyson to launch aninvestigation into a possible drug distribution racket. The interconnectedcorruption was astonishing. Larry Nichols said:> The first loan made at ADFA was to Park-O-Meter … As I started looking, I> found that the secretary-treasurer [of Park-O-Meter] was Webb Hubbell [of the> Rose Law Firm] … Guess who drafted the legislation … which created ADFA? Webb> Hubbell. Guess who introduced the legislation to our legislators and got it> passed through our house? Webb Hubbell. Imagine this. Guess who did the audit> and the evaluation on the [Park- O-Meter] application. Rose Law Firm, you> guessed it. Who signed it? Webb Hubbell, Hillary Clinton. Nichols said that when reporters made inquiries about the Park-O-Meter loans,they found that instead of making parking meters, the company was actuallybuilding retrofit nose cone compartments that were being shipped to the Menaairstrip. The nose cones were being used to smuggle drugs back into the countryand onto the streets of America. Nichols went on:> Webb Hubbell, the Rose Law Firm, are guilty, I say to you, of conspiring to> defraud the state of Arkansas, the Federal Government, and conspiring to> solicit the sales and the laundering of money for illegal drugs. This is your> president. This is his circle of power. These are the people when he got> elected president … he took them straight to Washington with him. Webster ‘Webb’ Hubbell was named as acting US Attorney General by Bill Clintonwhen he was elected to the White House in 1992, a year after accepting aninvitation from David Rockefeller to attend the Bilderberg meeting in BadenBaden, Germany. Hubbell was soon back in Arkansas, however, to plead guilty tocharges of defrauding clients at Hillary Clinton’s Rose Law Firm of an estimatedhalf a million dollars. This was the man who was responsible for the Ethics inGovernment Act, which required Arkansas legislators to report conflicts ofinterest. Astonishingly, this act specifically exempted Governor Bill Clinton,his appointees and relatives. Before Hubbell left Washington, he was responsiblefor finding a permanent Attorney General for Bill Clinton. This was Janet Reno,who became head of the hilariously-named US ‘Justice’ Department (which decideswho, when, where and whether to prosecute). Webb Hubbell is not the onlygovernment-appointed crook that Janet Reno came into contact with in her career.She was District Attorney for Dade County, including downtown Miami, which wasexposed as perhaps the most corrupt judicial system in the country. Thedecisions and judgements during Janet Reno’s term at the Justice Departmentserved perfectly the aims of the Reptilian hybrids. These included the massmurder at Waco and the suppression of information about drug running operations,like those out of Mexico involving the leaders of the Mexican government andconnected to the Bush/Clinton network. Researchers believe that Reno was a frontfor Webster Hubbell to be the real Attorney General.The Bush–Clinton drug ringOne of America’s biggest drug trafficking operations was set up at the Menaairstrip in Arkansas in 1982 and involved Barry Seal, a pilot for the DrugEnforcement Administration, or DEA. No, you didn’t misread that. The Reptilianhybrids use Orwellian Newspeak to give their front organisations names thatdescribe exactly the opposite of what they are there to do. Most people are notgoing to suspect the Drug Enforcement Agency of running drugs and that’s theidea. Once again, it is about controlling all sides. There are many genuineagents in the DEA, as there are in the FBI, CIA, British Intelligence, and soon, but they are confined to their compartments within the pyramid and theydon’t make the decisions. Seal moved his trade to Arkansas because of the hasslehe was having from the authorities in his home state, Louisiana. He had no suchhassle in Arkansas under Clinton. Russell Welch, the police officer in charge ofthe Seal investigation, revealed:> He said 1983 was his most profitable cocaine smuggling period ever. He said> that the airplanes he had placed at the Mena Airport, there were four of them,> a couple of Cessnas, a couple of Panthers, and one or two stragglers here and> there, different airplanes. He said they were purchased solely for the purpose> of cocaine smuggling. Welch added that the planes had special illegal cargo doors which could beopened in flight to drop the drugs and money at other sites in Clinton-governedArkansas. But where were the prosecutions? In the ten years during which theMena drug operation was common local knowledge, there was not one majorprosecution. Yet, when Clinton became President, he announced … guess what? Yes,a war on drugs – just like Father Bush did. At the same time, Clinton revokedrandom drug testing for White House staff (because there were so many cocaineaddicts like him) and dropped 121 posts at the Office of National Drug Control.Drugs pilot Barry Seal is also part of the link between Bill Clinton, OliverNorth, the Reagan–Bush administration and Iran–Contra. According to courtrecords, eyewitness reports and press accounts, Oliver North held a series ofmeetings at Little Rock in the early 1980s to set up the illegal Contra weaponspipeline. One of the main operatives was Barry Seal and another was Terry Reed,a former combat pilot in Laos, who became a successful businessman. He revealedthe involvement in drug trafficking of Bill Clinton, Father George Bush and theCIA in his 1994 book, Compromised: Clinton, Bush, And The CIA, written withco-author, John Cummings. Reed was a former US Air Force Intelligence Officerwho was recruited by the CIA to create a front company in Mexico selling hightechnology and consultancy. When Reed realised it was being used to ship drugs,he tried to get out of the operation and returned to Arkansas, then governed byClinton. As usual, Clinton and the CIA sought to silence and discredit Reed byaccusing him of what they were doing. He was charged by Clinton and the Arkansasauthorities for drug trafficking. Reed reveals in his book how Time magazine andother publications and newspapers were involved in disinformation and cover-upsto keep the truth about drugs from the public. Reed had helped to set up atraining base for Contra terrorism at Nella, eleven miles north of Mena. He saidat his trial in 1989 that at least one of the early meetings to plan the Nellaoperation was attended by Bill Clinton’s brother, Roger, and he said othermeetings were attended by Clinton’s close associate and drug-runner, DanLasater. Yet again, we see the One Party State in action. While the ‘Republican’Reagan–Bush presidency was involved in Iran–Contra, the ‘opposition’, in theform of ‘Democrat’ governor Bill Clinton, was covertly supporting it inArkansas.The power of the Reptilian hybrids to control the major newspapers and broadcastmedia was seen again in January 1995 when a 4,000 word article exposing theBarry Seal drug operation at Mena and its connections to Iran-Contra and the CIAwas withdrawn by The Washington Post. It was immediately dubbed ‘The GreatestStory Never Told’. The article was due to appear in the Sunday Outlook sectionafter eleven weeks of debate and argument among the staff. Lawyers had beenthrough every line and approved it legally, the type had been set, and theillustrations completed. The contracts with the authors had been signed andLeonard Downie, the executive editor, had given his consent. Then, suddenly, itwas pulled and the Post’s managing editor, Robert Kaiser (Council on ForeignRelations), said it was a ‘non-existent story’ and a ‘reprise of rumours andallegations’. The owner of The Washington Post was the Bilderberger,Trilateralist and Council on Foreign Relations member, Katherine Graham, a closefriend of Henry Kissinger. The authors of the article were Dr Roger Morris,formerly of the National Security Council under Johnson and Nixon, and SallyDenton, the former head of the Special Investigations Unit at the news agency,UPI. Both have long records of this type of investigation. Their exposé wascompiled from detailed research that included access to Barry Seal’s bank andtelephone records, invoices, appointment books, handwritten notes, personaldiaries and recorded conversations, plus police records and surveillancereports. The article said that Seal was flying planes out of Mena to exportweapons to Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil and the Contras in Nicaragua, and theyreturned full of cocaine for sale in New York, Chicago, Detroit, St Louis andother cities. Morris and Denton said that Seal had such close ties with the CIAthat he believed he could smuggle what he wanted, whenever he wanted, and theypoint out that nine separate attempts by state and federal authorities to stophim were blocked. All this took place during the Reagan–Bush ‘war on drugs’. Thearticle spiked by The Washington Post had said: ‘Over the entire episode loomsthe unmistakable dark shape of US government complicity in vast drug traffickingand gun running’. It asked the questions that the Reptilian-controlledmainstream media have failed to ask:> For three presidents of both parties – Messrs Reagan, Bush, and Clinton – the> old enduring questions of political scandal are once again apt: What did they> know about Mena? When did they know it? Why didn’t they do anything to stop> it? Answers: What did they know? Everything. When did they know? From the start. Whydidn’t they do anything to stop it? Because they were doing it.Barry Seal was not convicted for his drug crimes. Instead he was murdered. Thishappened as he was beginning to speak openly about what he knew. He told how hewas ordered by the CIA and the Drug Enforcement Administration to photographSandinista officials in Nicaragua loading drugs onto a plane for shipment to theUnited States. Seal later admitted to reporters that the Sandinistas in hisphotograph were not loading drugs at all, but the fake photo was used byPresident Reagan in a televised speech in March 1986 as propaganda against theNicaragua regime. This led to Congress voting another $100 million in aid to theContra terrorists in Nicaragua who were trafficking drugs for the CIA with thefull knowledge and involvement of the then Vice- President Bush. In February1987, soon after Barry Seal began to talk about the Contra drug smugglingnetwork and its connection with the Colombian cartels, he was removed. How couldall these things be covered up, glossed over, and the Clintons and Bushes notface criminal investigation? Former friend Larry Nichols has the answer:> A lot of people wonder how Bill Clinton could control a state the size of> Arkansas with the absolute authority that he did. It’s not hard. You see,> after twelve years, after kissing the people that have the money, Bill Clinton> controlled the legal system, he controlled the judges, he controlled the> attorneys, he controlled the banks. Which is what the Reptilian hybrids do on a national and global scale. It isalso worth remembering, given the fundamental involvement of the Clintons andBushes in the CIA drug trade, that Mohamed Atta, the ‘chief hijacker’ on 9/11according to the official story, was running drugs for the CIA through theflying school at Venice Airport in Florida, where the governor was Jeb Bush,brother of the Brainless One. With their closest of ties to CIA drugtrafficking, there is no way that the Bushes and Clintons didn’t know what wasgoing on in Venice and how it involved Atta. In fact, Arkansas ‘businessman’Jackson Stephens, a major financial backer of both Clinton and the Bushes, had apresence in Venice a block away from the airport where Atta took ‘flyinglessons’ and accessed unlimited supplies of drugs. Stephens has already made anumber of appearances in this book, you may recall. His Stephens Group inArkansas comes up again and again in the story of Bill Clinton and, indeed, theBushes, and he was a founder of the drug-running, terrorist-funding BCCI.Stephens was also a major investor in Boy Bush’s oil company, Harken Energy.The Clintons’ body countThe Bill Clinton years were littered with murders and suspicious deaths inArkansas and Washington. On August 23rd 1987, two boys, Kevin Ives and hisfriend Don Henry, were out walking in the early hours near the Mena airstrip(Figure 218). Later they were found dead on a railway line. The State MedicalExaminer, Fahmy Malak, a man appointed by Clinton, ruled that the deaths were anaccident. The parents disagreed and asked for a second opinion, a request thatwas met with resistance from the authorities on all fronts. They won a courtorder requesting samples for the second opinion of everything the crimelaboratory had, but Malak still refused to hand them over. Eventually, otheropinion showed that Don Henry had been stabbed in the back and Kevin Ives’ skullhad been crushed before they were placed on the railway line. Malak still saidit was an accident. The boys had both fallen asleep on the tracks, he said. Sixpeople who talked to the police about the boys’ murders were themselves killed.Keith McKaskie knew what was planned for him. He said goodbye to his family andfriends in 1988 and days later he was murdered. The following year, Jeff Rhodes,a young guy from Benton, Arkansas, rang his father to say he had to get out oftown because he knew too much about the deaths of the boys and McKaskie. Twoweeks later Rhodes was found shot dead. Keith Coney was fleeing for his life onhis motorcycle when he collided with a truck; Gregory Collins was shot; RichardWinters and Jordan Ketelson were both killed by shotgun blasts. The head of theSaline County Drug Task Force, who had uncovered evidence of the Arkansas PoliceDepartment’s involvement with drug smuggling and the cover-up of the boys’murder, was forced into hiding. This was all going on while the future PresidentClinton was governor for Arkansas. What was it again that Tina Brown said ofClinton in The Washington Post?> On Clinton’s face these days is a look of wry, judicious knowingness. It’s the> look of political wisdom, and it imparted to his conference’s departing crowd> something like serenity. Image [../Images/00227.jpg]Figure 218: Don Henry, 17, and Kevin Ives, 16 … two more victims of theClintons' killing spree Investigating Bill Clinton or making allegations against him would appear, fromendless evidence, to be a very dangerous occupation. Danny Casolaro, a reporterinvestigating Clinton and an alleged bonds racket, was found dead in a WestVirginia hotel. Paul Wilcher, a Washington lawyer, was investigating Clinton andwas due to meet Danny Casolaro’s former attorney. Wilcher was found dead sittingon the toilet in his apartment. Prosecuting attorney, Charles Black, askedGovernor Clinton for funds to continue the Mena drugs investigation. The moneynever came, but Black’s mother was brutally murdered. Police said there was noconnection. Ed Willey, the manager of Clinton’s campaign finance committee, diedfrom gunshot wounds. Verdict: ‘suicide’. John Wilson, a city councillor inWashington who was reported to be planning to expose Clinton’s dirty tricks, wasfound hanged in 1993. Verdict: ‘suicide’. Kathy Ferguson, the wife of Danny, anArkansas police patrolman and Clinton bodyguard, talked about a number of sexualincidents involving Clinton, and said her husband had taken state employee,Paula Jones, to Clinton’s hotel room where he dropped his trousers andpropositioned her. Kathy Ferguson was found dead with a gun in her hand.Verdict: ‘suicide’. Her husband Danny then claimed that what his wife saidwasn’t true, when it clearly was, and Clinton settled out of court with PaulaJones. Attorney Gary Johnson lived next door to Gennifer Flowers, one of thewomen Clinton denied having a sexual relationship with. Johnson had a securitycamera at his front door and this captured Clinton entering Flowers’ apartmentwith his own key. Johnson had this recorded on tape and could prove that Clintonwas lying, but he was attacked at his home and suffered the most terribleinjuries. The thugs stole his Clinton tape.Jon Parnell Walker, a senior investigator for the Resolution Trust Corporation,was pressing for an investigation into the collapsed Madison Guaranty Savingsand Loan Company, which was linked to Clinton and his wife, and this becameknown as the ‘Whitewater Affair’. Walker fell from the balcony of an apartmentin Arlington, Virginia. Verdict: ‘suicide’. C. Victor Raider II was co-chairmanof Clinton’s presidential campaign, but they fell out. Raider and his sonMontgomery died when their small plane crashed. Herschel Friday was a member ofRaider’s committee and an expert pilot. He died when his plane exploded. DentistRonald Rogers was on his way to talk to a journalist about Clinton when hisplane crashed in clear weather. Luther ‘Jerry’ Parks from Little Rock hadcompiled a study of Clinton’s sexual activities. Clinton owed him $81,000 forproviding guards during the presidential campaign and his wife said he hadthreatened to reveal the information he had unless he was paid. Parks was shotdead. His son, Gary Parks, said his father had names, dates, places – everythingabout Clinton’s liaisons. He said he also had details of Clinton’s drug takingand that of his brother, Roger. Shortly before his father’s murder, the phonelines at his home were cut, the security system turned off and the files onClinton were stolen. In Arkansas, no autopsy has to be performed on anyone ruledto have committed suicide even if the evidence points to murder. This law wasintroduced by Bill Clinton in one of his last acts as governor. Through all ofthis, Hillary Clinton was right at the heart of everything her husband was doingand supported, even instigated, what happened.The man who knew too muchThe death most publicised in connection with Bill and Hillary Clinton is that ofVincent Foster, a senior partner at Hillary Clinton’s Rose Law Firm and WhiteHouse deputy counsel when Bill became US President. His death by ‘suicide’ cameduring investigations into the Whitewater Affair. The Clintons said theirinvestment in the Madison Savings and Loans Company was a loss-maker. Others sayit was a scam to skim off federal money, which is the Clinton technique parexcellence. What is beyond question is that it cost taxpayers $60 million.Robert Fiske was named as special prosecutor to lead the ‘investigation’ intoWhitewater and that same week the Rose Law Firm began to shred documents. One ofthe shredders, Jeremy Hedges, said: ‘They had his [Foster’s] initials prettymuch all over … everything from the box to the manila files to – I even saw hissignature on one of the Rose Firm letterheads’. A demonstration was held outsidethe Rose offices when people heard what was going on. There was a fire the sameweek at the Worthen Bank Building that destroyed documents related to theWhitewater investigation. The bank was owned by … Jackson Stephens, Clinton’smain financial backer. Vincent Foster was found shot dead on July 20th 1993. Hisbody was officially discovered at Fort Marcy Park off the George WashingtonParkway on the west bank of the Potomac River across from the capital. Theverdict was, of course: suicide. This verdict was made before there had beeneither an autopsy or a ballistics test. The Arkansas whistleblower, LarryNichols, said he had a police memo proving that Foster was found in his car, notthe park. The first witness to find the body insisted that there had been no gunnearby, despite the official story claiming it was still in his hand. As alwaysin these fake suicides, vital evidence disappeared, including the memory ofFoster’s pager being wiped. Three experts, Vincent J. Scalise, a former New Yorkdetective; Fred Santucci, a former New York forensic photographer; and RichardSaferstein, former head of the New Jersey State Crime Laboratory, investigatedthe case for the Western Journalism Center of Fair Oaks, California. Theyreported:> •The position of Foster’s arms and legs were drastically inconsistent with> suicide.> •Neither of Foster’s hands was on the handgrip when the gun was fired. In> fifty years of combined experience they had ‘never seen a weapon or gun> positioned in a suicide’s hand in such an orderly fashion’.> •Foster’s body was probably in contact with one or more carpets before his> death. The team was amazed that the carpet in the trunk of Foster’s car had> not been studied to see if he had been carried to the park in the trunk of his> own car.> •The force of the gun’s discharge probably sent Foster’s glasses flying, but> it was ‘inconceivable’ that they could have travelled thirteen feet through> foliage to the site where they were found.> •The lack of blood and brain tissue at the site suggests Foster was carried to> the scene. The peculiar tracking pattern of the blood on his right cheek also> suggests that he was moved.> •Foster’s fingerprints weren’t on the gun in his hand.> •The fatal bullet could not be located.> •His appointments diary that day has never been found.> •His personal phone log has never been revealed.> •Foster’s sister, Sharon, was arriving from Little Rock that day with her> daughter, and in his last conversation with the younger of his two sons he had> discussed plans to buy a boat.> •Foster turned up for work that day even though he was supposed to be planning> to kill himself.Miquel Rodriguez was the assistant US attorney appointed to investigate Foster’sdeath, but he resigned after just four months saying the ‘investigation’ wasrigged. He said the suicide verdict was predetermined by a ‘higher authority’ atthe start of the investigation and that the White House was notified about thedeath even before paramedics reached the scene. In March 1994, when thespeculation would not go away, the White House issued a photograph of Foster’sbody at the scene, which was said to prove that it was suicide. The gun was inhis right hand, but Foster was left-handed. The photo shows the body surroundedby brown leaves, but he had died in the summer and reporters at the scene soonafter he died said there were no leaves on the ground. The White House alsoadmitted (five months after Foster’s death) that four members of Bill Clinton’sstaff had ransacked Foster’s office the night he died. They included PatsyThomasson, Hillary Clinton’s personal assistant. It was done, they said, forreasons of ‘national security’. No, the Clintons’ security. Patsy Thomasson wasa leading assistant to Clinton’s pal Dan Lasater when he was, as shown in court,dealing drugs. Thomasson was also named in law enforcement files for drugtrafficking and it was she who stopped drug testing for White House employees.This is a President of the United States we are talking about here. This is theWhite House, the supposed centre of power in the most powerful country in theworld. Despite all of this, Clinton was actually re-elected in 1996 and hisequally corrupt and homicidal wife came close to being the first ‘woman’president in 2008.The facts that could destroy the political ambitions of the Bush and Clintonfamilies are never exposed by their opponents because they are all in ittogether, all riding the same horse in the same direction. Their hidden masterssay what will, and will not, be revealed by both them and by the mainstreammedia. The cover-ups and lack of investigation into the real background of thosewho seek high office has led to two terms of Boy Bush, son of the drug-running,child-molesting, serial killer. Boy Bush is a monumental idiot and deeplyarrogant in the sense of a kid whose dad is bigger than anyone else’s in theplayground. He’s a big-talking coward who lets others do the killing andbullying on his behalf. His minder in the White House is his bloodline Vice-President, the truly brutal Dick Cheney, who has orchestrated, with the hiddenmasters, the introduction of the Orwellian state on a now colossal andever-increasing scale. Barack Obama was funded and hyped to take over the WhiteHouse with the job of expanding still further the national and global fascistdictatorship – unless they choose to assassinate him to tear America asunder incivil unrest and conflict. Even Hillary Rodham Clinton’s scheming, manipulatingand dirty-tricking were not enough in the face of the Brzezinski/Obama scheming,manipulating and dirty-tricking because the Illuminati’s chosen candidate alwayswins. But Hillary is not going to disappear and she will have her job to do forthe fascist cause. She has been the power behind Bill all along, through all thedrug-running, corruption and killing, as highlighted by Barbara Olson, the ChiefInvestigative Counsel for a congressional committee that investigated theClintons. In her book, Hell to Pay, she said that ‘in scandal after scandal allroads lead to Hillary’. Olson wrote of Rodham Clinton’s despicable methods whenshe was controlling events in the White House:> Hillary is not merely an aide and abettor to this secret police operation. She> has been its prime instigator and organizer. In the political life of the> Clintons, it was she who pioneered the use of private detectives. It was she> who brought in and cultivated the professional dirt diggers and smear artists.> It was she whose obsession with secrecy was so intense that when White House> Counsel and former judge, Abner Mikva, finally bowed to the law and delivered> subpoenaed documents, she and her White House scandal team lashed at him with> such a vicious streak of humiliating profanity that he resigned. And then> there is the public Hillary of It Takes a Village – gentle, mother-earth, and> caring-sweet-talking the American people into socialism for their children. > Hillary Clinton is a determined, focused leader who rapidly rose to the top> ranks of the radical left, and who now seeks to foment revolutionary changes> from the uniform of a pink suit. She used Arkansas as a laboratory for her> ideas. As first lady, she tried to wield direct power on the national level> and failed. Now she is inventing a career beyond her husband’s, to make her> own place in history – to find a path to ultimate power. But serving as the> junior senator from New York will not provide a stage big enough for such> ambitions. Like Eleanor Roosevelt before her, Hillary Clinton seeks nothing> less than an office that will give her a platform from which to exercise real> power and real world leadership. Hillary Clinton would have been very relieved that Barbara Olson was no longeraround to expose her during her election campaign. Olson was apparently apassenger on Flight 77, the plane that is alleged to have hit the Pentagon onSeptember 11th. Some eight years after Olson wrote those words, Clinton ran forpresident, but lost by a small margin to the campaign of Barack Obama, which wassaid to be the slickest in American history. For ‘slickest’ read best funded andmost manipulative and it is no surprise to read claims by Democratic supportersthat caucus voting in the primaries was rigged in Obama’s favour. But the sadthing is that it doesn’t really matter in the bigger scheme of things. Clinton,Obama and McCain are all bag-carriers for the Reptilian hybrid hierarchy.The British One-Party StateThis theme of one force controlling all sides can be found everywhere, includingthe one-party state they call the United Kingdom. There are some in politics whochallenge the system, though only up to a point, but, when it comes to thosemaking the crucial decisions, a one-party state is what it is. Dr Kitty Littlewas a long-time researcher into the corruption and infiltration within theBritish intelligence agencies (which are also deeply involved in the drug trade)and had access to sources at some very high levels for more than fifty years.Her career as a scientist included research for the Ministry of AircraftProduction during the Second World War, followed by nine years at the AtomicEnergy Research Establishment at Harwell. In her submission to the 1995 NolanCommittee on Standards in Public Life, she told the story of an attempt torecruit her to the Communist Party at Oxford University in 1940. What she saidis even more significant given what has happened since. What Kitty calls the‘Communist Party’, I would call the Reptilian hybrid conspiracy that worksthrough the political ‘left’, ‘right’ and ‘centre’. Oxford University was abastion of the Rhodes and Milner circles and the Round Table secret society,particularly All Souls, New Chapel and Balliol. The ‘communists’, Kitty Littlesaid, had gone ‘underground’ by joining the university Labour Party and sheattended a meeting of a Labour Party ‘study group’ in a room at UniversityCollege. The main speaker at the meeting, who clearly believed he was among‘friends’, began to reveal the plot to ‘destabilise the United Kingdom andCommonwealth, ready for a Marxist takeover’. Dr Little later realised that thiswas part of the plan to introduce the centralised global control that many callthe New World Order. The plot was outlined by the speaker at that Oxford meetingto destroy United Kingdom defences, engineer a Marxist takeover of Rhodesia andSouth Africa, and to use what is now the European Union as a smokescreen to hidethe changeover to a centralised, Marxist, rule of Europe. The plan was also todestroy British manufacturing industry. He went on to describe how members ofthe political section of this subversive organisation were going to infiltratethe British parliament and civil service, some entering each of the politicalparties. Many would go into the right wing of the Labour Party, others to theleft wing of the Conservatives. Eventually, there would be a fusion into a new‘centre’ party. He said that the British distrusted extremists and so posing as‘moderates’ occupying the centre ground would allow them to dismiss theiropponents as ‘right wing extremists’.This is precisely what has happened. In 1981, we had the creation of the SocialDemocratic Party (SDP) by the ‘Gang of Four’ who jumped ship from the LabourParty. They were Lord (Roy) Jenkins (Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission);Lord (David) Owen (Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission); Bill Rogers(Bilderberg Group); and Shirley Williams. All supported the EuropeanCommunity/Union and Jenkins went on to be President of the European Commission.Their party later fused with the Liberals to become today’s official ‘centreparty’, the Liberal Democrats. Tony Blair and his heavies then turned the LabourParty into the ‘centre-ground’ (extremist) ‘New’ Labour, and another politicalfraud called David Cameron, or Blair Mark II, has done the same with theConservative Party. I heard Blair and Cameron brilliantly described as ‘twocheeks on the same arse’. It has turned out just as the Oxford speaker said itwould. The UK has one major political party going under three names – Labour,Conservative and Liberal Democrat. The subversive organisation itself did nothave a name, the speaker said, because that would make it harder for people toprove it existed. He said that he had been chosen to head the political sectionof this organisation and he expected himself one day to become the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom. All this was said in 1940 and that man didindeed become Prime Minister. His name was … Harold Wilson.Wilson was the British Prime Minister throughout the period between 1964 and1976, except for the four years between 1970 and ‘74 when the Conservative Partyleader, the shapeshifting child molester, Edward Heath, was in office andsigning the UK into the European spider’s web. Wilson and Heath were bothBilderbergers and close associates of Lord Victor Rothschild, who controlledBritish Intelligence. Wilson took over the Labour Party leadership with thedeath of Bilderberger, Hugh Gaitskell, in 1963. Significantly, Gaitskell was notin favour of a federal Europe and his death was very convenient. It allowedWilson to become leader at an opportune time. Conservative Prime Minister HaroldMacmillan was driven from office by the Profumo spy scandal in the same yearthat Gaitskell died, opening the way for the Bilderberger Sir Alec Douglas Home(Lord Home) to take over the premiership. Home would later be a chairman of theBilderberg Group. The following year Home faced – and was defeated by – HaroldWilson in the 1964 election. The political upheavals in Britain happened at thesame time as those in the United States, where Lyndon Johnson became Presidentin 1963 after the Kennedy assassination in which, in my view, Lord VictorRothschild was involved.Dr Kitty Little told me that when she made her story public, the Daily Expressjournalist and writer of intelligence ‘exposés’, Chapman Pincher, showed a copyof her allegations to Harold Wilson. He was issuing libel writs like confetti atthe time, but his only reaction to Dr Little was to say she had mistaken him fora Tom Wilson. She knew she had done nothing of the kind, but she checked theentire university records and there was not even one ‘T’ Wilson enrolled therein the 20th century. She knew Wilson as an Economics Fellow at Oxford, becauseit was he who researched and compiled most of the Beveridge Report that createdthe welfare state and the social security system after the war. Sir WilliamBeveridge, she says, was little more than a figurehead who put his name to it.On the surface, the report was admirable in many ways, but from the perspectiveof today it can perhaps be seen to have wider implications. It createddependency and control while destroying opportunities for self-reliance andindependence outside the elite-controlled system. Now that this dependency hasbeen created, the welfare state is being dismantled and what is left is beinghanded over to ‘privatisation’ – the Reptilian hybrid bankers in other words.This is leaving people at the mercy of some very unpleasant people andorganisations. Dr Little said in her submission to the Nolan Inquiry that theintentions set out by the young Harold Wilson at Oxford were transmitted toMoscow, and by the end of 1941 a double agent in the Kremlin had given thedetails to Britain’s MI5. This was circulated to senior MI5 officers, but noaction was taken. During this period, Kitty Little said, the ‘senior subversiveinfiltrator’ within British Intelligence was Lord Victor Rothschild. Thenameless subversive organisation revealed by Harold Wilson has three sections,the political, economic, and ‘biological’. The head of the biological sectionwas the overall controller and, until his death, Dr Little says, that was LordVictor Rothschild. It will be another Rothschild today. In a letter to theSpeaker of the House of Commons on May 1st 1987, Dr Little says:> Early in the [Second World] war Wing Commander Arnold, then head of a section> in MI5, had reason to think that Rothschild was not to be trusted. He took> steps to have the most sensitive material kept from him, but found> Rothschild’s backers too powerful to do more than that. Later, when Sir Roger> Hollis was Director-General, he asked Wing Commander Arnold for a detailed> report of events from that era. > When Wilson became leader of the Labour Party a very serious problem arose,> since it was the head of the political section of the subversive organisation> who was in line to become the next Prime Minister. Shortly before his death,> the late Sir Theobald Matthew, the then Director of Public Prosecutions, told> me that he considered that he and the Director General of MI5 had almost> sufficient legally admissible evidence to prosecute. > Sir Theobald said that in his opinion when a Minister used his official> position to take action to promote objectives of a criminal organisation … in> a manner that would be criminal if he were acting as a private citizen, then> those actions are still criminal. This is only logical, since Ministers are> better placed than private citizens to do irreparable harm to the nation. Sir> Theobald died while [a smear campaign was organised] against Sir Roger Hollis> and the Deputy Director-General, that was launched with the aid of Lord> Rothschild … and so Wilson escaped prosecution. Lord Victor Rothschild covertly collaborated with ‘socialist’ Harold Wilson(Bilderberg Group) and worked openly with ‘Conservative’ Edward Heath(Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission), who occupied Downing Street betweenthem for some twelve years. Heath invited Rothschild to head his government’spolicy unit, the Central Policy Review Staff, and to select its personnel. Fromthis time the run down of Britain’s aircraft, shipbuilding, car, steel andmachine tool industries began to quicken – exactly as Wilson had predicted in1940 and Heath agreed to secretly when he signed Britain into the EuropeanCommunity/Union. It was also Rothschild’s influence that brought about thewidespread use of intensive chemical farming methods. Another of Rothschild’sroles was to supervise British Intelligence and reorganise the Foreign Office,and through both ‘left-wing’ Wilson and ‘right wing’ Heath he schemed for aEuropean superstate and the end of national sovereignty. During their periods inoffice, Heath and Wilson both made organisational changes to MI5. Wilson limitedthe techniques of investigation that were allowed and demanded to be told if anyMPs were under investigation. Heath went further and placed many other decisionmakers ‘out of bounds’ for the security services and the police. These two‘opponents’ had a number of things in common, including their enthusiasm for theEuropean Community. Dr Little said she was told that Heath and Wilson werefriends when they first arrived at Oxford University in the 1930s and they werecertainly working to the same end as prime ministers.As I said earlier, political leaders invariably come through the public schooland Oxford and Cambridge University system in Britain and its equivalent inother countries, such as the elite ‘Ivy League’ universities in the UnitedStates, which include Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Columbia. The term ‘publicschool’ is a misnomer because they are private fee-paying schools that thepublic cannot afford. The most elite families send their children to boardingschools, or ‘prep schools’, from the age of eight. Their parents deliver them tothese often foreboding places at this young age and see them only at schoolholidays or school events. Most people could never do this to their children,but, when I say the Reptilian hybrids have no empathy, this also applies torelationships with their own offspring. Look at the emotionless relationshipsthat the Queen and Prince Philip have with their children. This is archetypalReptilian. The prep schools, or preparation schools, are well named for once.The children are prepared through the prep school, public school and universityperception-machine for a life of system-serving and many never recover from theprep school/public school regimes based on fear, brutality and indoctrination.The bullies go on to run the system and the broken spirits go on to serve themin the lower ranks. One public school alone, Eton, where the royal children go,has produced nineteen British prime ministers.Tony the phoneyTony Blair was another public schoolboy to become Prime Minister when he wasmanipulated into office in 1997 to serve the Reptilian hybrids. He was selectedlong before he came to public attention, just like Clinton and Boy Bush, theAmerican presidents through the Blair years. Together, they have fronted theimposition of the Orwellian state. It was clear that Blair was a chosen one soonafter he became leader of the then opposition Labour Party in 1994 with thesudden and convenient death of John Smith. A year earlier, Blair had attendedhis first meeting of the Bilderberg Group, and Rupert Murdoch and his mediaempire switched their support for the first time from the Conservative Party toLabour when Blair became leader. To get this far, Blair must already have provedhis ability to follow orders without dissent and been fully aware of theconsequences of saying ‘no’. He had certainly been in the right place to be‘trained’ – the Temple in London where the secret society network, most notablythe Knights Templar, is all-powerful. It was there that Blair and his futurewife, Cherie, became barristers. He joined one of the barrister secretsocieties, or ‘Inns of Court’, called Lincoln’s Inn, located at Holborn, an areaowned by the Knights Templar many centuries ago. Anthony Charles Lynton Blair,born 1953, was the perfect front man for the Shadow People. He is vain andself-obsessed and wide open to ego massage. ‘Oh emperor, you are so wise to seethat we must take this course, you are such a great statesman and this willwrite your place in history.’ Blair’s apparent concern for how history will seehim is confirmation that the man is ego-led, and such people are babes-in-armsto the mind manipulators that surround them. He would also understand that younever refuse the masters – or else. Blair’s tenure in Downing Street, togetherwith the Illuminati’s American branch, advanced their goals dramatically. Heserved the agenda with distinction and he was a brilliant liar for those whodidn’t know the background until the passage of events found him out. Reptilianhybrid leaders go through ‘lie training’ in which they are coached andmind-programmed to believe what they say when they say it. As the former leaderof the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, said of Blair: ‘He always means it atthe time’. Geoffrey Wheatcroft, author of the book, Yo Blair!, makes a similarpoint:> He is something far more dangerous: he is not a liar but a man with no grasp> at all of the distinction between objective truth and falsehood. The more> sincere and intense his expression, the more likely he is to be saying> something that is not the case. It is the same with Bill Clinton. He has been through extensive programming tomake him a ‘safe’ puppet to place upon the throne who can lie while keeping astraight face without a hint of shame. Blair’s approach from the start was topresent one of the most corrupt regimes in British history as the guardians ofthe moral high ground. They used to joke in the Whitehall offices that theDowning Street answering machine asked people to ‘leave a message after the highmoral tone’. He sound-bit his way from country to country, camera to camera,delivering his fake words with fake emotion, like the political messiah hebelieved himself to be. He was indeed a British version of Bill Clinton,complete with mega corruption. At the Labour Party conference in 2001, hedeclared:> The starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant, those living in> want and squalor, from the deserts of northern Africa to the slums of Gaza, to> the mountain ranges of Afghanistan: they, too, are our cause. The Labour Party sycophants, who for so long cheered his every lie, wereecstatic at this declaration. There is nothing more powerful than telling peoplewhat they want to hear. Naturally, Blair would never deliver on his promises andempty words – he was never meant to. While he talked about ‘Labour values’, heset about dismantling everything the Labour Party had previously claimed tostand for. He did this in concert with his diabolical duo, Peter Mandelson(Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission), the slithering Svengali fixer fromthe Reptile House, and his vicious spinner-in-chief, Alastair Campbell. The bestway to decode the words of the Blairs, Clintons, Bushes or any of those inpower, is to reverse their every statement. It really is that simple most of thetime. ‘I never had sexual relations with that woman’, means ‘We had oral sex inthe Oval Office’. Blair’s support for ‘Labour Party values’ means ‘I am going todestroy them’, and his extraordinary claim to be ‘a pretty straight sort of guy’came from one of the most corrupt prime ministers in British history (an amazingfeat given the competition). And remember these are the people, liars for aliving, who told us the official story of September 11th. When Blair startedgoing on and on about ‘peace’ it was bound to be the precursor to war. Heappears to love wars. They became commonplace on his watch as he followed theorders of those who put him in ‘power’ and kept him there while it suited them.The invasion of Afghanistan was planned before 9/11 and the war with Iraq wasagreed before Bush was even president. The cover story, as usual, was to say theopposite. While the preparations were underway for the slaughter of the innocentin their hundreds of thousands, Blair talked about the need for peace andjustice, and lied about threats to the world from Saddam Hussein with all thecertainty of a man trained and programmed to believe it when he says it.However, such mendacity has a sell-by date and for Blair that is long past.Image [../Images/00228.jpg]Figure 219: Tony Blair – a ‘pretty straight sort of guy’. Anyone home? With no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, let alone the ability to deploythem against British targets within the infamous forty-five minutes that heclaimed, the Blair façade began to crack in the public mind and the crack becamea chasm. Through this, have since flooded revelations about the depth ofcorruption that has been running Britain for a decade – and there is far worseto come. Blair is the first sitting Prime Minister to be questioned by policefor a criminal investigation (though many others should have been) and he standsaccused of selling peerages to rich donors. Is he guilty? Of course he is, it’sdone with a nod and a wink that makes it difficult to prove. That’s the way theywork, these ‘pretty straight sort of guys’ (Figure 219). When he looks back,should he ever regain a grasp on reality, he may ask what it has all been for. Aplace in history? Yes, he has that, but not in the way his ego so yearned for.With what has come out already, and future revelations, the Blair years will befiled by history under ‘Contemptuous’. It has been said that every politicalcareer ends in failure and that is overwhelmingly true. Even those who come intopolitics with the best of intent find themselves blocked or absorbed by a systemthat is still there when they take their pension.Blair’s career is a failure in that he is an utterly discredited man sufferingfrom a heart condition that is far worse than publicly acknowledged. But, fromthe Illuminati’s perspective, Blair, like Bush, has been a towering success inachieving what they desire. Now he is no more use to them as Prime Minister, hewill be rewarded with money and he has been given another ‘prestigious position’as, outrageously, a ‘peace envoy’ to the very Middle East that he has helped toset ablaze with anger, indignation, death and suffering. If it suits the agenda,they may also eventually hang him out to dry. Either way, it is not his choiceto make, but those who have made him and can destroy him at will. So it is withall of these ‘powerful’ leaders of the one-party state."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 22 The sycophant vibration > A servile self-seeker who attempts to win favour by flattering influential> people. > Dictionary definition of ‘sycophant’ Presidents, prime ministers and all the other ‘leaders’ in the system come andgo to serve the Reptilian hybrid agenda. Some know exactly what they are doingand why, but most are manipulated or intimidated to follow the desired path.Sometimes money changes hands, sometimes secrets they don’t want made public areblocked from investigation and publication, so long as they do as they’re told.Cathy O’Brien and other recovering mind-controlled slaves have explained howpoliticians and others are targeted to provide them with men, women and childrenfor sex. This is then secretly recorded and they either play the game withoutquestion, or the tape is publicly exposed. They’ve got tons of stuff on Bush,Clinton and Blair for a start, although with them it’s not really necessary.There is another reason why the political system, indeed the system in general,thwarts even most of those who want to make a positive difference. Everything inthis reality is a vibrational construct and unless you are really strong andunmovable in your principles the construct can vibrate you into line. When youput two violins together and pluck a string on one of them, the same string onthe other violin begins to vibrate in what is called ‘sympathetic resonance’.Itzhak Bentov gives another example in his book, Stalking the Wild Pendulum:> Suppose we get several old-fashioned pendulum-type grandfather clocks. Let us> hang them on a wall and arrange the pendulums so that they will start beating> each other at a different angle, that is out of phase with each other. If we> disturb one of the clocks it will get locked [back] into rhythm quite fast.> The larger the number of oscillators within such a system, the more stable the> system, and the more difficult to disturb. It will force a wayward oscillator> back into line very quickly. This is what happens to so many people who want to change the system, especiallythose who go into politics. The system’s vibrational construct is now so denseand rigid that it vibrates most challengers back into line. I have seen this soclearly with the UK Green Party which began with the best of intention, or atleast many of its advocates did. It has become just another system-party stuckin rigid thought, refusing to even investigate the real cause of 9/11, or theglobal conspiracy in general. Its MEPs in the European Parliament now dress,think and talk like the classic construct-politician and they support a ‘Europeof regions’, which is exactly what the Illuminati are manoeuvring for – thebreak up of countries into regions ruled by a centralised European hierarchy ina United States of Europe. The Green Party has been vibrated into line and nowserves the construct because it is part of the construct. As a result, it is anirrelevance. Politics is full of ‘radical’ politicians who became system-serversand two who always come to mind are the British Labour Party’s Neil Kinnock andPeter Hain. Windbag Kinnock was the ‘firebrand’ anti-establishment orator whoargued against British membership of the European Community/Union. He and hiswife went on to make an absolute fortune by serving the European Union asbureaucrat and politician, and Kinnock is now a member of the very House ofLords that he once claimed to despise. The system got him because he was alwayswind rather than substance, and the construct has those people for breakfast,lunch and dinner. Peter Hain made his name as a campaigner for human rights andthen became a pillar of the establishment in a Blair government demolishinghuman rights. The examples are endless of vibrational turncoats whose principlesare negotiable in return for wealth and power. Their own energetic construct isnot strong enough to resist the system’s construct, and it falls to sympatheticresonance. The system is always seeking to force ‘a wayward oscillator back intoline’ in all areas of society, not just politics. This manifests itself infive-sense reality with people being ridiculed, condemned, fired, marginalised,attacked financially, jailed or even killed for refusing to shut up and conform.Some, however, and the numbers are gathering, will not concede at any price andthey are the ones who will make the change.Rule by sycophantThere is another energetic construct that goes under the name of ‘sycophant’. Itis the crucial support system to the power elite. Sycophant is defined as‘someone who flatters in a servile way; a crawler,’ and you find them in everyarea of life, particularly around royalty and those in high political office.The ‘Syc-oes’ are, in truth, the very foundation of the system that seeks toenslave us and their vital contribution to world affairs, war and injustice ismostly ignored and seriously underplayed. I have always had an aversion to thesycophant, the arse-licking hero worshippers who concede their right to freethought and individuality to the perceived ‘greatness’ of another – or in thebelief that it will help them scale the social peaks. The establishmentstructure is fiercely hierarchical and sycophancy is the sticky stuff, or sickystuff, that holds it all together. The rule is that you must be sycophantic tothose ‘above’ you and demand sycophancy from those below. That way, everyoneknows their place and which arse to keep clean. These hierarchical structuresare classically Reptilian and right in line with the traits of the ReptilianBrain, or ‘R-complex’.There is no better example than the British Royal Family. People bow, kneel andback out of the room in the presence of these deeply imbalanced symbols ofinjustice and control simply because of their manufactured titles like king,queen, prince, princess, lord or whatever. Ambitious clergy must know that ‘God’is one step down from the monarch. They might not say this, but that’s how mostof them act, especially those in the finest robes and prettiest frocks. TheChristian hierarchy may talk about the need for justice, fairness and equality(well, now and then), but they know their place. The Mother Goddess on thethrone must not be criticised for her staggering wealth, most of it plunderedthrough theft, slaughter and conquest across the centuries. That would upset theGoddess, the Defender of the Faith, and she is there to be obeyed, notchallenged. The climbing clergy don’t become a voice of the downtrodden andabused. No, no, they are in service to the system. The Holy Grail of sycophancyis the monarch’s Coronation when the ‘servants of God’ tell the people whichfalse idol they should pay homage to. The fact that the would-be monarch sittingon the throne before them is only there because their bloodline has beenmanipulated, often through violence, into the succession is of no interest orrelevance to the men in the Nimrod hats. You want to speak out against thesystem and be a Christian priest? Well, I know this little village church on anisland in the far north of Scotland. When can you leave? The Coronation scriptcaptures the mood:> The Archbishop, together with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Great Chamberlain,> Lord High Constable, and Earl Marshal (Garter King of Arms preceding them),> shall then go to the East side of the Theatre, and after shall go to the other> three sides in this order, South, West, and North, and at every of the four> sides the Archbishop shall with a loud voice speak to the People: and the> Queen in the meanwhile, standing up by King Edward’s Chair, shall turn and> show herself unto the People at every of the four sides of the Theatre as the> Archbishop is at every of them, the Archbishop saying: > Sirs, I here present unto you> Queen Elizabeth,> your undoubted Queen:> Wherefore all you who are come this day> to do your homage and service …Can I have the sickbag after you, please? Strict ritual is utterly Reptilian –they just love it, and sycophancy is an essential ingredient. Power can be animmense magnetic force and those who seek it, or its prestige, are bound to besucked in. There is an antidote, though: don’t seek power over others and keepyour tongue in your mouth. Trevor Phillips is Britain’s best-known ‘defender ofracial equality’. He claims to believe that everyone should be treated the sameand given equal opportunity, no matter what their race, creed or colour. If thiswere the case that would be great, but it isn’t because the establishmenthierarchy takes precedence over everything, including racism. Sycophancy isall-powerful. I wrote to Mr Phillips when he was head of the Commission forRacial Equality, a government operation designed, it says, to investigate andprosecute cases of racial discrimination reported by the public. I made anofficial complaint about the fundamentally racist system of selecting thereigning monarch. Not only does the king or queen have to be white and from thesame genetic line, they even have to follow, at least officially, a particularbranch of a particular faith – Protestant Christianity. The monarchy is the mostracist and elitist of institutions and I asked Phillips and the Commission to(a) investigate and prosecute those involved, and (b) why the head of the‘anti-racist’ Commission (i.e. him) had accepted an honour from a racial elitist– the Queen. I received in return a bullshit letter from the Commission lawyerthat studiously avoided the points about royal racism and the gross hypocrisy ofPhillips’ honour. It was the establishment speaking on behalf of itself. Ofcourse it was. The demands of the system overrule everything, especially logicand justice. The power structure has to be defended at all costs. Phillips wasrewarded for his loyalty to the established order by being appointed to head a‘Commission for Equality and Human Rights’, where he can serve the system in abigger chair.Re-wired ‘Rockers’Maybe it’s just me, but the sight of ‘Prince of Darkness’, Ozzy Osbourne,talking about the ‘honour’ of performing before the Queen makes my belly churn –as do the bevy of showbiz ‘celebs’ and others who line up each year to be‘honoured’ by monarchy and state for ‘services’ to whatever. Invariably, itmeans service to the system, the very system that is screwing the people whomade them ‘celebs’ in the first place. One notable example is the former‘anti-establishment’ rock singer, the money-obsessed Mick Jagger of the RollingStones. He completed his seamless transformation to system sycophant when heaccepted a knighthood at Buckingham Palace in 2003. The Stones’ Keith Richardssaid it was ‘ludicrous’ for Jagger to take a ‘gong’ from the establishment,because it was not what the band was all about. He must have surely noticed thatJagger had long succumbed to the attractions of system-worship and kneeling toroyalty was merely history repeating and taking its course. It is a well-troddenpath. ‘I don’t really think the establishment as we knew it exists any more’,said the new ‘Sir Michael’ Jagger. In fact, it is more powerful than everbecause the lines are no longer clearly drawn. It has not diminished, it hasfurther infiltrated. Only its faces have changed, not its power-base.A profound expression of the establishment suction machine is the case of ‘Sir’Bob Geldof, another royal honour-bearer and unofficial ‘Sir’, and Bono of theband, U2. For me, Bono has always been more lightweight in his presentation ofglobal injustice, but at the time of Live Aid in 1985 Geldof was magnificentlyoutspoken about the system’s built-in bias that blights the lands and lives ofbillions. What has happened to him since the surly became a ‘Sir’? The constructappears to have vibrated him into line. We now have the sight of Geldof praisingBoy Bush for what he has ‘done’ for Africa, and the same with Blair and hissuccessor as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. Bono called them ‘the John and Paulof the global development stage’ in his bid to be Sycophant of the Year. Yet,Blair and Brown are front men for the very rape of Africa and elsewhere thatGeldof once so memorably articulated. They both supported and instigated financeand action that has led to the death or maiming of more than a million civiliansin the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq. They supported and campaignedfor sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s that, even according to United Nationsfigures, cost the lives of more than half a million children. As with all‘Western’ governments, their trade and finance policies are devastatingcountries in Africa. Even so, Geldof told the Labour Party Conference that Blairand Brown had helped to change the political landscape by putting Africa at thetop of the agenda at the 2005 G-8 summit in Gleneagles, Scotland. ‘It reallyaltered the parameters of what’s doable in politics’, he said. ‘They saved anawful lot of people from going down the tube. That was achieved last year. Itmust be continued.’ Claptrap Bob. For God’s sake, wake-the-hell-up. In reality,Gleneagles was all a show, a sleight-of-hand to which Geldof, Bono and their‘Live-8’ concert gave essential cover. It wasn’t that they meant to, but theybecame so close to the manipulators they fell for the manipulation. Geldof andBono have both been invited to speak at the Labour Party Conference and, on astage that is the very epitome of spin, this does not happen unless it servesthe spinner’s purpose.Geldof is not a sycophant of power in its most extreme sense, though Bono showsall the symptoms, but he has allowed the intoxication of political position tocloud his judgement. If you are a potential problem to the system it eitherseeks to destroy you or draw you into its lair. Once again, Keith Richards sawthrough the contradictions, refusing to take part in Live-8 because the linebetween establishment and campaigner was much too thin: ‘I just thought theconnection between Geldof and the Labour Party was ... just too tight ... Who isthis gratifying and where were the Africans? Where was their say?’ Africanmusicians were only introduced to Live-8 when their absence was highlighted andcondemned, and even then they were given their own stage hundreds of miles awayfrom the main event in London. It was musical apartheid, not on the basis ofrace, but of fame. ‘Music’ has an establishment also. ‘Sir’ Bob Geldof and SirMick Jagger had tried to make Richards change his mind … ‘Oh yeah, all the Sirshad a bash – every one of them’, he said. Richards may well have been seen asnot supporting the suffering children of Africa, but, in his assessment of whathe saw, he was right. Surely we should be pursuing real change, not thesycophantic illusion of it. As the aid charities have confirmed, even thelimited promises at Gleneagles in 2005, so praised by Geldof, have not beendelivered. They were never meant to be. By the time of the G-8 summit in 2007even Geldof and Bono appeared to realise that they had been had.The fawning faithfulI watched with a gathering dismay the trail of British ‘celebs’ supporting the‘New’ Labour Party under Blair as, like Bush’s Republicans, it goose-stepped itsway to an Orwellian tyranny. The Labour Party was founded in 1893 as a defenderof the masses from the fascism of the established order, but, under successiveleaders, especially Blair, it has become the established order and so many ofits sycophants have made the same journey. In 2006, the lie-machine that isAnthony Blair made his last speech as leader to the Labour Party Conference. Itwas the usual catalogue of lies, exaggerations and avoidance of reality. If youever find a half-truth in a Blair speech it is a typing error. One newspaper putit like this: ‘Almost every word Blair spoke would have been perjury had he beenon oath’. As the last lie left his lips, the Labour faithful were on their feet– their symbolic knees – for nine minutes cheering and clapping to the dictatesof those conducting this sickening spectacle. Hundreds of thousands of deadpeople were forgotten, the lies that led to wars of conquest and mass murder nolonger conscious. Sycophancy is truly an amnesic condition. As if the soul hadnot suffered enough, the next day brought Bill Clinton to the Labour stage forhis fix of hero-worship. This is the man who joined with Blair to bomb theformer Yugoslavia and impose the devastating sanctions on Iraq; who gets hiskicks abusing mind-controlled slaves like Cathy O’Brien; who ran cocaine throughthe Mena airstrip in Arkansas with the Bush family; and whose life is litteredwith the dead bodies of those who could have brought him down. Tony Blair saidof Clinton: ‘When I see him speak, I thank the Lord he is on my side’. Ascharacter references go, it doesn’t get much worse. Where were the members ofthe Labour Party (the ‘party of the people’) when Clinton’s last lie had fadedinto the ether? Back on their sycophantic feet cheering the very personificationof the system their party was supposed to have been founded to challenge. EvenKen Livingstone, the long-reformed ‘left wing radical’ Mayor of London, was upthere smiling his approval and slapping palms with the rest of them. The‘radical’ Guardian newspaper put it this way:> … this was the speech of a truly serious political leader, and if it went on> five minutes longer than it needed to do, it was still a performance of the> highest possible class. If one were reviewing it, five stars would not be> enough. What a speech. What a pro. And what a loss to the leadership of> America and the world. That was said by a ‘serious’ newspaper of a drug-running serial liar and serialkiller. In America, the rich and famous ‘Democrats’ of Hollywood, the very homeof sycophancy, treat the Clintons like royalty when, in reality, their lives arelike a script from a horror movie. Where establishment power goes, sycophancyfollows, for without it there would be no establishment power in the firstplace. It is not only that power creates sycophancy, but that sycophancy createspower. Political power is the ability to make others do things. If we don’t dothem where is the power? It is the sycophants and the acquiescence of thegeneral population that allows the Reptilian hybrids to prosper. What we arelooking at here is like a mathematical equation: Desire for control + sycophancy= power. Desire for control + sycophancy + acquiescence of the generalpopulation = absolute power. It is in the latter equation that the answer lies.Real change for the better is not triggered from within ‘the club’, the‘establishment’ in all its forms, where elites rule and sycophants follow andlick. It happens when the club is forced to acknowledge the will of the people –or fall. Great reforms have come when the people have said enough is enough andthe establishment has had to respond to protect itself. There is a belief thatyou have to be inside the club to affect decisions, but it’s not true. If youencircle the building with demands for change and cover all the exits (don’ttake no for an answer), the establishment has to act. Far from covering theexits, Live-8 and Gleneagles in 2005 provided one. It allowed the appearance ofaction on world poverty to hide the fact that nothing of substance washappening. When the pathetic ‘help’ for Africa was announced, Bob Geldof and coshould have been screaming ‘no, no, disgraceful – the campaign will be steppedup and we will hound you and expose you until you do the decent thing’. Instead,he talked up the ‘help’ and gave the dark suits their getaway car.The real sign of change at the Labour Party conference, when Blair made his lastappearance as leader, was outside the hall in the tens of thousands of peoplewho came from all over Britain to protest at the wars of conquest and control.It is in such demands for change and, even more importantly, in mass peacefulrefusal to cooperate with the system, that the powers of imposition will losetheir grip on the lives of people. Only then will establishment power be exposedas the illusion that it is – power that is nothing more than the abdication ofpower by sycophant and population. Even this is only a stage on the road to anew and truly free ‘world’. Changing the established order is one thing, butwithout a massive consciousness shift to a higher level of awareness, an oldestablishment falls only for a new one to replace it. Indeed, old and new arethe same establishment under different names, be it a democracy, a republic, ora fascist state. Only with an enormous shift, way beyond the Reptilianconsciousness of hierarchy, can we move into the realm of universal freedom.We’ll know when we get there, because the desire for power over others will beconfined to history, bloodline will be irrelevant and the world will besycophant-free."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 23 Made in Manchuria > Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery. None but ourselves can free our> minds. > Bob Marley Mind control is not some fantasy story that you see in the movies. It has beenhappening to you all your life. To control the population you need to controlthe way they think, feel and perceive reality, and every minute of every daymost people are repeating as their ‘opinion’ what someone else has implantedconsciously, or subconsciously.Mind control is not only the creation of ‘Manchurian Candidates’ to carry outassassinations and do the will of their programmers. It is also manipulating thepopulation to believe the official story of 9/11 and that there really is a needto destroy freedom so that freedom can be protected. Control of the mind is toget someone to think what you want them to think and thus dictate theirbehaviour. Under that definition, who isn’t mind controlled to a larger orlesser extent? ‘Journalists’ and other media people are mind controllers, andmost of them don’t even know it. By reporting a false version of events they aregetting people to think in a way which suits the power structure. That is mindcontrol, nothing less. Every Problem-Reaction-Solution and Totalitarian Tiptoescenario is mind control at work, and so is manipulative advertising that makesyou buy this car, or that tin of beans. We are entering deeply significantterritory here. When you are the few and you wish to control the many, you mustprogram the minds of the many to see the world as you wish them to see it. Ifyou can’t do that, you’ve got no chance. You don’t have the numbers to controlthe masses physically and you have to manipulate them to police themselves andhand their power to you. I have done an enormous amount of research into mindcontrol over the years and met a long line of people subjected to governmentmind control projects in many countries, especially North America and the UnitedKingdom. They tell compellingly consistent stories of what happened to them andthe famous names involved – the Bushes, Clintons, Windsors, and other names thathave already appeared in this book. I am going to explore many facets of mindcontrol, including the targeting of children and the population in general, butI’ll start by describing what happens in the beyond-top-secret mind controlprogrammes. These are run and financed by the Reptilian hybrid network throughthe agencies of politics, military and ‘intelligence’. They are designed toproduce assassins, sex slaves for the sex-obsessed Reptilian hybrids, andfully-controlled people who can serve the agenda in many and various ways.One mind, many ‘people’One method of creating human robots is called Multiple Personality Disorder(MPD), also known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). This involves usingtrauma to fracture the mind into a series of self-contained compartments, or‘alters’. When we experience extreme trauma, like a serious road accident, themind creates an amnesic barrier around the memory so we don’t have to keepreliving it. The memory is retained in vivid detail, because we are so focusedat times of trauma and danger, but it is prevented from entering the consciousmind. How many times do people injured in car crashes say they cannot rememberthe immediate lead up to the accident, or the impact? The reason is this mental‘firewall’ and on that level it’s a good thing. As they knew thousands of yearsago in ancient Egypt and Babylon, and developed further in the concentrationcamps of Nazi Germany, this process can be used to create mind-controlledzombies. They honeycomb the mind into endless compartments – ‘alters’ – by usingconstant torture and other forms of extreme trauma to create the amnesicbarriers that block out the memory of the horrors they have experienced. Each ofthese alters thinks it is the whole mind when it is a mere fragment. The mindmagicians create what is called a ‘front alter’ that is programmed withpersonality traits that appear to be the victim’s ‘personality’. People theymeet think the front alter is who they are, just as the victim does. The ‘backalters’ in the subconscious are programmed with various other ‘personalities’,or tasks, and when the trigger words, sound or action are given the alters‘switch’. A back alter comes forward to take over their physical behaviour andperception of reality and the front alter is ‘parked’ in the subconscious. Oncethe task is completed, the alters are reversed and the front later comes back.It has no idea what has been experienced by the other alter in its absence. Inthis way, children can be sexually abused by people like Father George Bush andhave no memory of it, or messages can be passed between famous people incomplete secrecy.Mind-slaves are used to assassinate Reptilian hybrid targets, such as JohnLennon and JFK’s brother, Bobby Kennedy (see And The Truth Shall Set You Freeand The Biggest Secret for the details). This is why so many assassinations areperformed by people with the same mental profile – the so-called ‘lone nutter’.They are not alone, and their apparent insanity is their programming. Two ‘deadeyes’, as they are called, were Thomas Hamilton, who killed sixteen children ata school in Dunblane, Scotland in 1996 and Martin Bryant, who was jailed for theshooting spree at Port Arthur in Tasmania that killed thirty-five people weekslater. Such things are Problem-Reaction-Solutions coordinated to traumatise thepopulation and cause the fear that seeks protection from the authorities.September 11th was an extreme example of this technique. These people are oftenprogrammed, like Hamilton, to kill themselves, so the evidence dies with them.At least most of the suicide bombers are mind-controlled ‘dead eyes’ used toinstil collective trauma and fear. These mind-control techniques are notconfined to the ‘West’, they are used everywhere. Mossad, the Rothschildintelligence agency based in Israel, is expert in these matters, and it has usedprogrammed suicide bombers to divide and rule and stop any peace negotiationsthat the Reptilian hybrids want to scupper. I was not in the least surprisedwhen the former German Defence Minister, Andreas von Buelow, told me that the‘Arab’ terrorist, Abu Nidal, the Osama bin Laden of his day, was an asset ofMossad.One we made earlier …Cho Seung-Hui, the 23-year-old student who killed more than thirty people in ashooting spree in April 2007, was an obvious case of mind-control (Figure 220).The mass murder took place at the Virginia Tech in the apparently insignificanttown of Blacksburg, but a nearby mountain is home to one of the most secret andadvanced centres for government–military mind control programmes in the UnitedStates. The profiles of these ‘lone nutters’ and strange people who carry outthese mass and targeted assassinations (and some who are wrongly accused ofdoing so), are remarkably similar because they are products of the sameprogramming techniques. Here are some common themes in these mind-controlledassassinations and massacres: psychiatric treatment and drugs that causesuicidal behaviour, mania, psychosis, hallucinations and hostility; an obsessionwith something, often guns; the person being ‘a loner’ with a personalityconsidered ‘strange’ or ‘weird’ by those who knew them; killing themselves afterthey kill others; unaccountable incompetence by the police before, during orafter the event; the absence of normal security arrangements or reactions.Almost all programmed killers and killings have combinations of thesecharacteristics, and again and again psychiatric drugs are involved. This wasthe case with: ‘Unabomber’ Ted Kaczinski; Charles Carl Roberts IV, the Amishschool assassin; John Hinckley Jr, who tried to assassinate President Reagan (anact that would have made Father Bush president); Michael McDermott, who killedseven co-workers in 2000; and Byran Uyesugi, who did the same in 1999. Thesedrugs were also used by most of the other people I have already mentioned andmany more. Now look at what the London Daily Mail said about Cho Seung-Hui,under the headline: Murder threats, stalking, sick plays: why was he free tokill?Image [../Images/00229.jpg]Figure 220: Cho Seung-Hui > No-one doubted that Cho Seung-Hui was weird.

Classic.One student said that Cho ‘walked like an apparition ... like a ghost’. As withThomas Hamilton in Dunblane, he was able to buy guns, despite his unstablebehaviour. The medical report that he had been sectioned in a psychiatrichospital did not show up when gun checks on him were carried out. In December2005, a district court in Montgomery County, Virginia, ruled that Cho was ‘animminent danger to self or others’ after stalking the two female students. Onceagain, nothing was done. One of his lecturers, the British-born Lucinda Roy,filed a report to the university more than a year before the shooting saying hewas in need of urgent psychological help. She had been concerned by his macabrewritings and plays (probably ‘inspired’ by his trauma programming). Theauthorities said Lucinda was denying his ‘freedom of speech’ and nothing wasdone, except for a suggestion that he change classes. She said of Cho: ‘It feltlike I was talking to a big dark hole, sometimes, as if the person wasn’t reallythere’. ‘He’ wasn’t; his programming was. There was a nearly two-hour gapbetween the shootings of the first two people at 7.15 am and when Cho began hismain killing spree. In that time there was no mass warning of students, eventhough loudspeakers are located throughout the campus. Instead, the universitysent emails. The police did not seal off the campus after the first killings, afact that former university police officer, George French, said was ‘beyondbelief’. ‘Setting up a series of roadblocks, controlling access to very largepieces of property, is very much routine on any university campus in Canada andthe United States’, he said.> After a double homicide, when you’re looking for a dangerous fellow with a> firearm, I find it unfathomable that a series of roadblocks weren’t set up ...> to prevent the felon from escaping. If you had a snowstorm, the whole> education system can be shut down with a few phone calls. French said that all universities have ‘very serious plans’ to respond to suchattacks using ‘all county, state, and local law enforcement ... in Blacksburg,we saw police cowering and hiding’. French said he could find no logicalconclusion except deliberate inaction on the part of officials: ‘We have anothercoordinated, allowed event ... the parallels are so common in each case, you canwrite the script in advance’. The late Lawrence Teeter was a lawyer for themind-controlled patsy, Sirhan Sirhan, who is still in jail after being wronglyconvicted for the assassination of Bobby Kennedy in 1968. Teeter said of theextraordinary lack of investigation by Los Angeles police in the Sirhan case: ‘Idon’t believe in the Keystone Cops hypothesis for these assassinations. There istoo much stupidity for this to be stupidity’. That’s the way it is in all thesestaged killings. Police and emergency medical staff have said there was an orderfrom the federal authorities not to pursue Cho while the killing was going on.An eyewitness, Matt Kazee, said that police and medical people told him thesame. They were ordered to wait until the Feds arrived. The Virginia Techmassacre was a textbook psychological warfare attack on the American psyche bythe nexus of mind-control and special operations personnel. The headquarters forthe US military’s psychological warfare chiefs is Fort Bragg, North Carolina,where Michael Canavan, the head of security for the Federal AviationAdministration on 9/11, was Commanding General, Joint Special OperationsCommand. The plan is to bombard the collective psyche with so many shocks, suchas ‘terrorist attacks’ and ‘lone nutter gunmen’, that the public look to theirgovernment to protect them. In doing so, people will accept fundamental breachesof their civil and human rights in the cause of ‘keeping us safe’. It is simpleand devastatingly effective until the targets know what the game is.Image [../Images/00230.jpg]Figure 221: A mind-controlled Richard Hammond thinks the pedal car is his ownPorsche. Paul McKenna is in the background So easy …Most people don’t realise how completely the mind can be controlled, but askilled hypnotist can work apparent miracles, even without the long-term traumathat the big boys deal in. I saw the British hypnosis expert, Paul McKenna,program the television presenter, Richard Hammond, in an edition of the BBCmotoring show, Top Gear. Obviously, the preparations had been done before thefilmed sequences, but Hammond would not have remembered that. He sat behind thewheel of a car on a test track and McKenna gave the trigger signal thatimmediately caused him to lose consciousness. He was given the instruction thathe would not remember how to drive a car and when he was ‘clicked’ back to awakened state that’s exactly what happened. He couldn’t remember even how toinsert the ignition key. All this happened on film and when they came back liveto the studio they had a good laugh about it. For Hammond, though, it wasn’tover. McKenna triggered him again and told him that the toy pedal car on thestudio floor was actually his brand new Porsche 911Turbo. He got into the pedalvehicle as if it was his own full-sized Porsche and another presenter, JeremyClarkson, ran his pedal car into the side (Figure 221). Hammond reacted as ifhis Porsche had been hit. When you see that, imagine what is possible in mindcontrol projects that have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on researchand development, and endless victims on which to experiment. The ‘physical’ bodyis a computer and can be programmed with ‘software’ instructions when you knowhow it works – and these guys do.Cathy’s Story …The major problem the manipulators face is that as a person gets older theirmind can become strong enough to break down compartments. At this point, thememories of what happened come flooding back. Not only that, they aregraphically relived because, as I said, the mind is so focused at times oftrauma that memories recorded in those states can be recalled with photographicdetail. I have met so many people who are going through this unimaginableprocess, including one woman who thought she had been a virgin when she marriedonly to realise she had been in countless sexual encounters while in otheralters. One thing they are all agreed upon, however, is that while the sick anddepraved can program the computer level of reality they cannot get to their corespirit, the eternal, infinite ‘I’, and it is that which gets them through themost unspeakable experiences. In 1996, it was my great privilege to meet theincredible Cathy O’Brien (Figure 222), who has become a close and valued friend.She is the co-author, with Mark Phillips, of Trance-Formation of America andAccess Denied, which tell her story and expose the stunningly evil mind controlprogrammes in the United States. I have heard the same basic story, and many ofthe same names, from a host of recovering mind-slaves. It is clear that what ishappening in North America is happening in Britain and throughout the world.What Cathy says has been supported so many times in my research and, challengingas it is for those who are new to this information, it is, unfortunately, true.Image [../Images/00231.jpg]Figure 222: Cathy O’Brien – an extraordinary woman Cathleen Ann O’Brien was born in 1957 in Muskegon, Michigan. Her father EarlO’Brien was a paedophile and one of her first memories was being unable tobreathe because his penis was in her mouth. Such trauma automatically triggersMultiple Personality Disorder as the child’s mind blocks out the memory behindan amnesic barrier. Her father’s friends were also allowed to abuse and rape theyoung Cathy and her brothers, just as her father and mother had been abused aschildren. Her mother was sexually abused by Cathy’s grandfather, the leader of aMasonic Blue Lodge. Her mother’s brother, ‘Uncle Bob’ to Cathy, was a pilot inAir Force Intelligence who claimed that he worked for the Vatican. That willcertainly make sense to readers of this book. ‘Uncle Bob’ was a commercialpornographer and Cathy’s father forced her and her older brother Bill to takepart in pornographic films made for the local Michigan Mafia. They wereconnected to the ‘Porn King’ Gerald Ford, who then represented Michigan inCongress. He would later be the Vice-President of the United States underRichard Nixon and President when Nixon was ousted by Watergate. Cathy says shewas raped by Ford while a little child in the office of Michigan State Senator,Guy VanderJagt. When Ford died aged 93 at the end of 2006, President Boy Bushcalled him ‘a great American who gave many years of dedicated service to ourcountry’ with his ‘quiet integrity, common sense and kind instincts’. SenatorVanderJagt, who also raped little Cathy, would become the chairman of theRepublican Party National Congressional Committee which supported thepresidential campaign of Father George Bush, another child rapist named inCathy’s book who has turned up over and over in my research into child abuse.Gerald Ford, a Yale man yet again, served the Illuminati nearly all his life andhe was appointed to the Warren Commission which covered up the truth about theKennedy assassination. Documents released in 1997 revealed that it was Ford whochanged the evidence of where Kennedy was hit to make it conform to theludicrous ‘magic bullet’ theory – the claim that a single bullet had struckKennedy from the rear, passed through his body to hit Texas Governor JohnConnally in the back, before exiting through his chest, passing through hiswrist and ending up in his thigh. As Cyril Wecht, president of the AmericanAcademy of Forensic Sciences, said: ‘In order to accept the single-bullettheory, it is necessary to have the bullet move at different vertical andhorizontal angles, a path of flight that has never been experienced or suggestedfor any bullet known to mankind.’ But have no fear, Gerry’s here. Father Bushsaid in the eulogy at Ford’s funeral:> After a deluded gunman assassinated President Kennedy, our nation turned to> Gerald Ford and a select handful of others to make sense of that madness. And> the conspiracy theorists can say what they will, but the Warren Commission> report will always have the final definitive say on this tragic matter. Why?> Because Gerry Ford put his name on it and Gerry Ford’s word was always good. What can you do but laugh in the face of such barefaced nonsense?Project MonarchCathy’s father was caught sending child pornography through the post – a film ofyoung Cathy having sex with a boxer dog. To avoid prosecution, Cathy was handedover by her father to the United States government and the Defense IntelligenceAgency. He was delighted with the deal because he was now immune fromprosecution and could continue his pornography and paedophile activities whilethe authorities looked the other way. The agency was searching for sexuallyabused children with Multiple Personality Disorder who came from families with ahistory of intergenerational child abuse. The ‘aptitude’ for mindcompartmentation and the creation of alters is passed on through the generationsin the computer downloads we call procreation. They want the children before theage of five or six while the neuron pathways are still forming and, in Cathy’scase, she was used for ‘studies’ into genetic mind control, operating under thetitle of Project Monarch. They were particularly keen to find children withblond hair and blue eyes (the genetics that Reptilians most want to interbreedwith), so Cathy was perfect for them in every way. Project Monarch was anoffshoot of the notorious MKULTRA programme (later also known as MKSEARCH) thatwas started by the Reptilian hybrid CIA Director, Allen Dulles, in 1953. TheMKULTRA records were destroyed in 1973 on the orders of CIA Director, RichardHelms, when news of what was going on began to come to light. The government wasforced into announcing an inquiry into the CIA’s activities. Guess what it wascalled? The Rockefeller Commission, headed by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller.Guess who officially ordered it? President Gerald Ford.MK stands for Mind Kontrolle – the German spelling of ‘K’ replacing the ‘C’ indeference to the Nazis formerly serving Hitler who inspired the project. Theyincluded Josef Mengele, the ‘Angel of Death’ in the concentration camps. Heperformed mind and genetic experiments on the inmates that produced many of thetechniques that were employed in MKULTRA. Mengele’s experiments with twins inthe concentration camps gave him the ability to compare how his experiments hadchanged the mind of one compared with the other. I have met many people who weresickeningly tortured and abused by Mengele in North America where he used thename ‘Dr Green’. Mengele and his fellow Nazis in MKULTRA escaped from Germany atthe end of the war thanks to British intelligence (the Rothschilds), the Officeof Strategic Services and CIA (headed by Allen Dulles, who started MKULTRA), theKnights of Malta and the Church of Rome. The man who arrived at Cathy’s house togive her father the ultimatum of ‘hand over your daughter or be prosecuted’ wasGerald Ford, who ordered the ‘inquiry’ into MKULTRA and the CIA when the brownstuff hit the fan. See how it all works? Cathy’s father was sent to HarvardUniversity, near Boston, to be instructed in how to prepare his daughter for themad professors of the government agencies. Cathy says in her book,Trance-Formation of America:> … in keeping with his government-provided instructions, my father began> working me like the legendary Cinderella. I shovelled fireplace ashes, hauled> and stacked firewood, raked leaves, shovelled snow, chopped ice, and swept –> ‘because’, my father said, ‘your little hands fit so nicely around the rake,> mop, shovel, and broom handles …’ By this time my father’s exploitation of me> included prostitution to his friends, local mobsters and Masons, relatives,> Satanists, strangers, and police officers … > … Government researchers involved in MKULTRA Project Monarch knew about the> photographic memory aspect of MPD/DID, of course, as well as other resultant> ‘super human’ characteristics. Visual acuity of an MPD/DID is 44 times greater> than that of the average person. My developed unusually high pain threshold,> plus compartmentalisation of memory, were ‘necessary’ for military and covert> operations applications. Additionally, my sexuality was primitively twisted> from infancy. This programming was appealing and useful to perverse> politicians who believed they could hide their actions deep within my memory> compartments, which clinicians refer to as personalities. The Church of Rome and Jesuit connection comes up again in Cathy’s story. Givenits fundamental involvement in the global conspiracy, how could it not? Cathysays she was abused by Father James Thaylen when she sought comfort at a RomanCatholic Church called St. Francis de Sales in Muskegon. Another priest, aFather Don, was a paedophile who helped Gerald Ford’s friend, Guy VanderJagt, toconfuse and abuse her in line with the ‘requirements’ of Project Monarch. Later,she was sent to a Roman Catholic School, one of many used to safely housemind-controlled children under a strict regime designed to increase the depth oftheir Dissociative Identity Disorder. Her school was Muskegon Catholic CentralHigh School where she was raped by Father Vesbit many times, on one occasionduring a satanic ritual involving other mind-controlled boys and girls in hisprivate chapel. The Reptilians and their hybrids are the force behind Satanism.The Jesuits, Knights of Malta and the Roman Church hierarchy are all involved inmind-control outrages like Project Monarch and MKULTRA. Cathy was pressured andmanipulated by the Catholic ‘priests’ into keeping secrets from a young agethrough a technique known as the ‘Rite to Remain Silent’, and there were so manysecrets to keep locked away in her compartmentalised mind. Religions are widelyused to manipulate people and as a ‘respectable’ cover for torture and mindmanipulation.Mind-controlled ‘leaders’Cathy says she was placed under the control of the US ‘Democrat’ Senator forWest Virginia, Robert C. Byrd, and her abuse by him and government agenciesexpanded. She said that Byrd controlled a network of mind-controlled slaves andloved nothing more than to whip them mercilessly until they were close to death.One of Byrd’s associates, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, would later tortureCathy by putting a needle in her eye while her daughter, Kelly, was forced towatch. Leahy was Vice- Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and servedon Byrd’s Senate Appropriations Committee. He went on to be Chairman of theSenate Appropriations Subcommittee for State, Foreign Operations and relatedprogrammes. Byrd, a cocaine addict, often bragged to ‘safe’ people of how hemind-controlled President Jimmy Carter while he was Carter’s ‘confidant andadvisor’. The hypnotic voice of Byrd became the ‘voice of God’ to a praying andmeditating Carter, who faithfully followed the ‘guidance’ he believed wasdivine. Many ‘world leaders’ are under forms to mind control because theReptilians and their hybrids are terrified of ‘mavericks’ and people they can’tcontrol. Boy Bush, Clinton and Blair have all been through forms of programming.It helps them to sell a lie because they ‘mean it when they say it’ and it canhelp people become very good actors. Hollywood is full of actors and actresseswith Dissociative Identity Disorder. Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, theunofficial son of Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton-Rothschild wineestates in France, told me:> The last non-dissociative President of the United States was Dwight> Eisenhower; except for him, every one since Teddy Roosevelt has had some level> of dissociative disorder and some level of involvement in the occult.> President Clinton has ‘full blown’ multiple personality disorder and is an> active sorcerer in the satanic mystery religions. This is true of Al Gore, as> well; I have known Misters Clinton and Gore from our childhood as active and> effective Satanists. Cathy’s torture and mind-control was inflicted at many government establishmentsaround America, including the NASA Space and Rocket Centre at Huntsville,Alabama, where she, and later her daughter Kelly, were used for pornographicfilms. Another establishment for mind-controlling slaves was known as the ‘CharmSchool’ at Youngstown, Ohio. This is a ‘sex slave’ training ‘school’ whereCathy, her daughter Kelly and countless other women and children were torturedand abused with electric shocks, sleep deprivation and sexual trauma. Cathy saysan unnamed member of the Reptilian hybrid Mellon banking family (architects offluoride in drinking water) was the ‘governor’ of the Charm School, and otherwell known people involved were US Representative Jim Traficant, a Catholic whowas born in Youngstown, and Dick Thornburgh, then Governor for Pennsylvania, whowould become US Attorney General and an under-secretary general at the UnitedNations. Traficant was jailed for alleged corruption and tax evasion in 2002after he began to speak publicly against elements of the conspiracy. While stilla child and later, Cathy was raped, abused and tortured by some very famouspeople. She says that she was raped by the Jesuit Pierre Trudeau, the long-timePrime Minister of Canada, who worked closely with the Church of Rome; she wasraped again by Gerald Ford when he was actually President; raped by RonaldReagan while he was President; and raped many times in the most brutal fashionby Dick Cheney, the White House Chief of Staff under Ford, Defense Secretaryunder Father Bush at the time of the 1991 Gulf War, and Vice-President andhandler to his son. Cathy is able to describe Cheney’s office in the Pentagon ingreat detail. Cheney, like the Bush family, is an immensely imbalanced mindcapable of unspeakable violence and murder. Cathy says that Cheney told her onone occasion: ‘I could kill you – kill you – with my bare hands. You’re not thefirst and you won’t be the last.’‘The Most Dangerous Game’These are the people who tell us we must fight terrorism and ask us to believetheir version of 9/11. Cheney, Father Bush and Clinton get their kicks from agruesome torture called ‘The Most Dangerous Game’. It involves threateningmind-controlled children and adults with appalling consequences if they arecaught in the hunt. They are then allowed to ‘escape’ into a forest, usually insome top secret military base or ‘retreat compound’ like Lampe, Missouri, andMount Shasta, California, which are surrounded by a high fence to prevent anyreal escape. Father George Bush, the man who called for a ‘kinder, gentler,America’, Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton often go hunting slaves with guns, Cathywrites in her book, and no doubt Boy Bush has done the same. When the slaves arecaught, they are brutally raped and sometimes killed. The Mount Shasta/LakeShasta compound, where Father Bush and Cheney shared an office, is, according toCathy, ‘The largest, covert mind-control slave camp of which I am aware’. MountShasta is an enormously powerful energy centre and these are often targeted bythe Reptilian hybrids for their Satanism and other appalling activities. It wasat the Mount Shasta compound that she saw an enormous fleet of unmarked blackhelicopters, which, as researchers have revealed, are part of the Illuminatiprivate army that is being installed to instigate a coup d’état on the people.These helicopters have often been reported near the scenes of ‘alien abductions’and cattle mutilations. Cathy O’Brien describes her own experience of ‘The MostDangerous Game’ at the compound called Swiss Villa at Lampe, Missouri. BillClinton and Father Bush went ‘hunting’ with dogs for her, daughter Kelly and twomind-controlled soldiers, one of whom had Italian-looking features:> Swiss Villa appeared deserted, except for Bill Clinton and George Bush, who> stood at the edge of the woods with their hunting dogs at the ready to embark> on ‘The Most Dangerous Game’ of human hunting … Bush and Clinton were dressed> alike in camouflage pants, army boots and wind breakers. The two also shared> the trademark of wearing a cap of cryptic meaning. This time, Bush’s> camouflage cap had an orange insignia that said ‘Dear Hunter’. Clinton’s blue> cap read ‘Aim High’ and had a picture of a rifle on it. Clinton appeared> awkward with his hunting rifle, while Bush looked like an expert marksman with> his black rifle with elaborate scope. > ‘The rules of the game are simple’, Bush began, triggering me by using the> same words that always preceded a Most Dangerous Game. Clinton interrupted> ‘You run. We hunt’. Bush continued: ‘This will be called Hunt for a virgin’> (Clinton chuckled) ‘and she’s it’. Bush pointed to Kelly who was still in my> arms. ‘I catch you, she’s mine.’ > Clinton spoke up: ‘You’ll have plenty of time to play with the dogs because> they’ll have you pinned down while we …’ (he slid a bullet in the chamber for> emphasis) ‘… hunt down the bigger game’. Clinton glared at the ‘toy soldier’> with the waxy face. (Toy soldier was a term I often heard referring to the> mind-controlled robotic special forces young men who operated under the New> World Order.) The two guys ran for the woods. Carrying Kelly, I began running> too. Judging from the close proximity of the dog barks, I had not gone far> when they were turned loose. The five barking dogs caught me right away and> surrounded me. Kelly screamed as one snapped at her leg and I automatically> slapped at its face. I was convinced the dogs were going to tear us up by the> time Bush and Clinton walked into the clearing. They seemed to be engaged in a> serious conversation until Bush looked up and smiled. ‘She’s mine’, he claimed> (referring to Kelly). ‘But then, she always has been. Let go.’ > As I walked past Clinton, who was still deep in thought, he mumbled: ‘I> thought you’d be fucking a dog or something’. We walked the short way back in> silence with Clinton veering off to the right as Bush directed me toward the> two helicopters. The door next to me slid open and Clinton pushed the Italian> into the helicopter. ‘I caught this one. He’s going to ride jumpseat.’ Bush> motioned for him to sit in the leather chair marked for death by the black> rose, while I rode in the actual jumpseat. > Come here, little one, Bush coaxed Kelly. ‘You can sit on Uncle George’s lap.’> He lifted her onto his lap as Clinton got in front with the pilot, who was> starting the engines. ‘Over the lake, Jake’, Bush told the pilot. Flying over> Swiss Villa’s deep, remote lake, Bush set Kelly aside, stood up as far as he> was able in the helicopter, and slid the door open. The powerful wind blew> Bush’s greasy strands from his face as he gestured for the man (the Italian)> to stand up. > ‘Free fall’, Bush instructed. ‘That’s an order.’ > ‘Yes, sir’, he replied as he stepped out of the door fully clad in his> camouflage uniform and military boots – with no parachute. I watched in horror> as he fell to his death in the water below, splatter and submerge … This is just one incident, one murder, in the lives of Bill Clinton and GeorgeBush, the men the people of the United States voted to be their president; buttheir Reptilian minds have no capacity for empathy and the suffering of othersmeans nothing to them. Cathy also tells of meeting Boy Bush on some of theseoccasions and his relationship with his father and Cheney was clear long beforehe became president. She says that he was mind-controlled and also hunted in‘The Most Dangerous Game’. ‘It was my experience that Junior stood by his fatherand covered his backside whenever Bush would become incapacitated by drugs orrequired criminal backup. It appeared that Junior was there to serve bothpurposes while his father and Cheney enjoyed their work-vacation’. Boy Bush – athug, criminal, and gofer to his father and Cheney – would be given two terms aspresident and nothing changed when he moved into the White House some twentyyears after Cathy’s experience of him. He remained a puppet of his father andCheney and he has been just a figurehead, doing and saying whatever he’s toldwhile others control events. It is incredible to think that the Bushes andClinton, who have been involved in such abuse and murder, officially controlledthe White House for a total of seven terms, one after the other since 1979, ifyou include the Reagan years when Father Bush was really the president. HillaryClinton failed to extend the Bush—Clinton presidential dynasty, but theirinfluence remains.Mind Control and SatanismCathy was forced to marry a mind-controlled Satanist called Wayne Cox, a memberof the Jack Greene country music band. Greene, a CIA operative, was also aSatanist. Cox’s job was to further traumatise her to create more compartmentsthat could be used to program new ‘personalities’. One night, Cox took Cathywith him to the ruins of the Union Railway Station in Nashville and, using aflashlight, found a homeless man asleep. He ordered Cathy to ‘Kiss the railroadbum goodbye’ and proceeded to shoot him in the head. That was horrific enough,but he then produced a machete and chopped off the man’s hands before puttingthem into a zipper bag. As Cathy has stated at public meetings many times, WayneCox is a serial killer who invariably chops off the hands of his prey. Cathysaid:> By 1978, Wayne Cox, my first designated controller, was actively ritually> murdering and dismembering bums, children, and those who ‘wouldn’t be missed’> and blatantly distributing body parts from his Chatham, Louisiana home base to> key satanic capitals of several states which included the Little Rock/Missouri> route. Government agencies know this, but he is immune from prosecution because heworks for them. Cox led Cathy to another spot on the Union Station site, a towerat the old railroad depot, and waiting in a room for them was Jack Greene,members of his band and others dressed in black robes. They were standing arounda black leather altar. The room was draped in red velvet and lit by candles.Cathy was laid on the altar and subjected to rape and torture while theSatanists performed a black magic ritual that involved sex, blood andcannibalism. Years later when ‘married’ to another CIA asset, Alex Houston, shewould be made pregnant and artificially aborted many times so the foetus couldbe used for satanic rituals. I have exposed at length the Satanism of thebloodline families in my other books, like The Biggest Secret, and what Cathysays I know to be true from endless sources all over the world who have seen itfor themselves. One of Cathy O’Brien’s controllers was the late Lt ColonelMichael Aquino, a top man in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s PsychologicalWarfare Division. He was the head of a satanic ‘church’ known as the Temple ofSet, an organisation inspired, apparently, by the leader of Hitler’s SS,Heinrich Himmler, who based his organisation on the Jesuit Order. The Temple ofSet was a breakaway from Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan that attracted many ofHollywood’s rich and famous. When it was exposed that America’s PsychologicalWarfare was being headed by a Neo-Nazi from a satanic church, the officialresponse was that a man’s religion was his own business. All the famousReptilian hybrids that I am naming are involved in Satanism. Remember whatPhillip Eugene de Rothschild said:> When I watch CNN, it startles me to see so many familiar faces now on the> world stage in politics, art, finance, fashion and business. I grew up with> these people meeting them at ritual worship sites and in the centers of power.> Financiers, artists, royalty, and even Presidents … I can recall the> Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals … The Reptilian hybrids have always taken part in these sacrifice rituals rightback to Babylon and beyond. People who are new to this will be understandablyaghast at what is being said here. However, not only is it true, it is happeningon a fantastic scale across the world. The ‘sacrifices to the gods’ have beenwith us throughout known history and they are still going on. Sacrificialkilling is designed to release the energy of terror from the victim which can beabsorbed by the Reptilian entities – the ‘gods’ – on the interspace planes. Therituals also create the energetic ‘stepping-stone’, or vibrational connection,that allows the entities to possess the participants even more powerfully. Theywant this because we are looking at the demonic hierarchy beyond this realitybeing reflected in the hierarchy of the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines here. Inother words, the more powerful the demons that possess you, the higher you willbe in the Illuminati power structure. There are rituals where fathers impregnatetheir daughters and the child is later ‘sacrificed to Satan/Lucifer’ – theleader of the Reptilians – and there is another ritual where parents mustsacrifice their first born. This does not always have to be on an altar, it cansometimes be in another way, even an engineered road accident at an importantritual location to the Illuminati that appears to the public to be just an‘ordinary’ road, or street. Satanism and the mind control programmes such asProject Monarch are intertwined and two expressions of the same force. Manyvictims of mind-control and multiple personality disorder say they experiencedreptilian entities and remember the ‘lizard eyes’ (Figure 223).One centre for Cathy O’Brien’s mind programming was Salt Lake City, Utah,headquarters of the Mormon ‘Church’, which I have exposed at length in otherbooks. Victims of its abuse and mind control techniques have told me of beingforced to take part in human sacrifice rituals at various locations, includingunderneath the main temple in Salt Lake City, where participants shapeshiftedinto reptilian and other forms. This figures when you think that the Mormonmovement was started by the Merovingian bloodline, based on Freemasonry, andfunded by the Rothschilds’ Kuhn Loeb and Company. The Jehovah’s Witness ‘Church’is another Reptilian hybrid front and mind control operation, and they are allconnected as different strands in the same web. Salt Lake City is a Reptilian‘nest’. Researcher Alan Walton described Utah in general as ‘one of the majorunderground nesting areas for both reptilians and hybrids’. Among the manytestimonies I have had from the victims of Mormon Satanism and mind control wasone from a woman I will call ‘Jane’. She said the first Mormon ritual sheattended was in Bountiful, Utah, wearing the dress her mother had made for herfourth birthday. She was beaten and battered with branches from a tree and shewas told: ‘See, Jesus doesn’t love you and he is not going to save you’. This isstraight from the manual of trauma-based mind control. She recalled vividlybeing placed in a cedar chest and the lid secured. She was left in there untilshe lost consciousness and when she was revived she was told that Jesus didn’tlove her and that Satan had come to save her. She also has memories of nearlydrowning many times and she says she was belittled, beaten, and starved. Herfather would eat in front of her and her brother while they went hungry. Hermother was treated the same. Once again, all these are classic mind controltechniques.Image [../Images/00232.jpg]Figure 223: I have been sent many drawings over the years by recoveringmind-slaves and their therapists that portray the reptilian eyes and nature ofthe mind-controllers ‘Jane’ says she was taken to the most secret Mormon rites at the Salt LakeTemple at the age of twenty. Instead of entering through the front door, she wastaken through a tunnel under the street to a place called the ‘Pink Room’. I wassent some material after a visit to Salt Lake City that was claimed to come froma military source. It described how the Mormon temple is on top of a Reptilianunderground base that could be accessed from the temple itself. Many ancientpyramids, temples, mounds, and other earthworks also have entrances tounderground Reptilian cities. In the ‘Pink Room’, Jane said she saw several ofthe Mormon leaders dressed in black worshipping Lucifer in a ritual called the‘True Order of Prayer’. This is a ritual form of the ceremony the regularMormons go through with all its signs, tokens and penalties. She said she sawone Mormon leader, President Ezra Taft Benson, tied to a chair and gagged whenhe refused to watch the sacrifice. When he still refused to participate, shesays he was put in a white bag, like a laundry bag, and they all beat him. Janealso experienced the unexplainable disappearance of foetuses she was carrying:> I would be fine and three or five months pregnant with not a sign of anything> wrong and then I would not be able to feel my baby by feeling my abdomen or> feel it move and I would not be pregnant. One time I was very far-gone, but I> don’t know how far, maybe seven months, and the baby disappeared and I was> kept drugged for six weeks. When I came out of being drugged I felt my stomach> and there was no baby. > A couple of years ago I remembered delivering that baby in a room … I was> attended by two men that I don’t know and one said he was the father of the> baby. After he was born, they held him up for me to see and I never saw him> again and have never known what happened to him. I also remember having four> babies removed from my body and them being sacrificed while I was tied to a> cross-shaped stone alter. > Everyone had on black robes and hoods and we were underground in a cave or> something. I also remember seeing two monsters fighting furiously dripping> blood and fighting about what they were eating.

I can’t get the furiousness of them eating out of> my mind. It is so horrific. Eating the baby is exactly what they were doing. The scene that Jane describesunder the Salt Lake City Temple is the same as that recounted by mind-controlvictim, Arizona Wilder, at the rituals conducted for the British royal family atplaces like Balmoral Castle. Jane said: ‘The blood that they crave is like ahomeopathic formula for our feelings and thoughts to be transmitted to them’.This is what really goes on at the top of the Mormon Church and I have hadsimilar stories told to me many times. The church hierarchy uses the naïve,innocent and mind-controlled to cover the truth of what Mormonism really is –Reptilian hybrid Satanism. The rank-and-file Mormons who knock on your door orstop you in the street with their scrubbed faces present the image that hidesthe lie while genuinely believing they are serving ‘the Lord’.A prime location for the Monarch programming/Satanism connection in Europe isalleged to be the Château des Amerois (sometimes known as the ‘Castle of Kings’)in Bouillon, near the village of Muno in Belgium. This area was owned byGodefroi de Bouillon, leader of the First Crusade and Bush family ancestor. Thechâteau is known by researchers as the ‘Mothers of Darkness Castle’. This iswhere the Mothers of Darkness, a high position in Satanism, are mind-controlledand trained. It once belonged to Prince Philippe of Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha, theWindsor bloodline, and it was believed to be connected with the child murder,abuse and Satanism network involving Marc Dutroux, which shocked Belgium in1996. He was jailed, but the big names had their backs covered by the Reptilianhybrid control of the system. There were many testimonies during the Dutrouxaffair about orgies in castles. Dutroux’s accomplice, Michel Nihou, organisedthem in his Faulx-les-Tombes castle and children’s corpses were found buried atthe Château du Sautou, near to the Belgium border, which was the property of theserial killer, Michel Fourniret. Reptilians love their castles and stately homeswhere they can worship and connect with their ‘gods’ away from public view.Satanism has its origins with the Reptilians. The ‘Watcher’ called Azazel in theBook of Enoch is the source of the goat head in satanic ritual and the term‘scapegoat’. According to the Book of Leviticus, the Israelites would sacrificetwo male goats at Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. One was offered to God andthe other to Azazel. The priest placed both hands on the head of the Azazel goatand confessed the sins of the people. The goat would then be taken into thewilderness and plunged over a cliff, symbolising the fallen angel Azazel, whowas seen as bound and chained in the (vibrational) wilderness – the ‘abyss’ inthe language of the Book of Revelation. The goat head of Azazel, a ‘fallenangel’ Reptilian, is symbolised by the inverted pentagram of Satanism (Figures224 to 226). The goat-horn hand-sign is used by Satanists as a form ofcommunication and identification to other initiates. Some refer to this as the‘Sign of the Horned God’ (Figure 227). It is no surprise at all, given thebackground I am describing, that you see it used so often by those in power(Figure 228). The major religions and most of the smaller ones have also dupedtheir followers into worshipping the Reptilian ‘gods’ without knowing it – andwhat you worship, in awareness or otherwise, you give your energy to. TheReptilian hybrids have no problem attending Christian services, because theyknow who ‘God’, ‘Jesus’ and ‘Mary’ really represent – Nimrod, Tammuz andSemiramis.Image [../Images/00233.jpg]Figure 224: The inverted pentagram, the ‘goat head’ symbol of Satanism How did Zack know?The satanic ritual network connects into children’s homes, runaway hostels andtoddlers’ nurseries to ensure a constant supply of children. I was asked by thegrandmother of a five-year-old boy called Zack to investigate his claims to havebeen abused at a branch of the KinderCare pre-school nursery operation in NorthCarolina. Zack said that he was taken from the pre-school in Cary to a housewhere he was tied up and made to watch people sacrifice a little boy. He saidthat he and other children were made to drink the blood and eat the flesh of thedead child. He also claimed that they took his own blood. Zack had a smallcircular puncture on his arm, which looked like a mole was growing there. Hesaid this is where they put the ‘needle-knife’ into him. He has also talked ofseeing ‘bad movies’ all the time. The mother of another boy at the centre, afour-year-old called Tyler, said her son had asked her if it was all right forpeople ‘to eat each other’, and I have heard directly from other parents whosechildren have talked about being forced to drink blood. In one case, aten-year-old was talking about her grandparents in these terms and they turnedout to be big-time Satanists. When Zack heard his mother on the phone talkingabout tunnels, he said he didn’t like the tunnels at school. He said that one ofthe people involved was called ‘Camelot’ and he ‘turned into a dragon’. Hisparents told me that Zack began to talk about the Anunnaki. When he was askedwhat they were, he said they were ‘gods’. He said that he learned about theAnunnaki at the ‘bad school’. His grandmother, Suzen, asked him if he had everheard the word ‘Dingir’ (she pronounced it Ding-gear), a Mesopotamian name forthe Anunnaki that translates as ‘The Righteous Ones of the Blazing Rockets’.Pronouncing it Ding-er, he said it was a bad word because the Ding-er ‘eatpeople skin, people blood, and people bones’. He added: ‘Their love goes awayand they turn into vampires’. She asked about the name ‘Enki’ and he said:‘That’s a bad word’. Then Enlil – ‘that’s a fish word’. This five year old thensaid: ‘They’re brothers, aliens, and they’re from Mars’. Zack said he saw moviesabout it at school and they were going to destroy the world. The lizards lookedlike Darth Maul (in Star Wars) and also the ‘masks’ they had at school, he toldhis grandmother. Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa told me how he had been shocked thefirst time he saw the Darth Maul character, because it was so like many‘Chitauri’ entities that he had seen and had described to him. One day Zack sawa picture of France. He pointed to a place near the Alps and said: ‘That’s wherethe armies are saving people for the reptiles’. Suzen asked him where he heardabout reptiles and he said the people at the ‘mean school’ told him they werereptiles. He said: ‘Aliens like to come here at Halloween and Easter. They likeEaster’. I tell Zack’s story in more detail in Children of the Matrix.Image [../Images/00234.jpg]Figure 225: The pentagram at the entrance to the ‘Mother Lodge’ of Freemasonryin Great Queen Street, London Image [../Images/00235.jpg]Figure 226: Baphoment, the goat-headed symbol of Satanism Image [../Images/00236.jpg]Figure 227: The hand-sign for the horned god – or Devil – of Satanism Image [../Images/00237.jpg]Figure 228: The horned-god hand-sign is often use by those in political power The police and social services were utterly useless in response to what Zacksaid and the new director at the KinderCare centre put the phone down on me. Ialso contacted the corporate headquarters of KinderCare in Portland, Oregon, andthey issued a short statement to me through a very nervous PR person saying thatthe claims were ‘unsubstantiated’. As if she would know. KinderCare would notanswer any of my questions and I received a letter threatening legal actionagainst me if I did not remove all the information about Zack from my website.This just made me investigate more and I found out that KinderCare, the leadingchildcare organisation in the United States, was owned by the empire of HenryKravis, a very close friend of Father George Bush, the Reptilian shapeshifter,who is one of the world’s most famous paedophiles and serial killers. Anyonethat close to Bush must know of his paedophile activities, surely? Kravis was amember of the inner circle of the Republican Party around the Bush family and heis also closely connected with Henry Kissinger and the Rockefellers. Kravis’company, Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts (KKR), the owners of KinderCare at thetime, made massive contributions to the Republican Party and the George Bushcampaign for the presidency. In all, their combined contributions to Bush’selection fund totalled millions. Kravis has also given considerable donations tothe cause of Zionism and, like his second wife, is a member of both the Councilon Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group. Kravis and KKR sold theKinderCare business to the Knowledge Learning Corporation in 2004. I also readan article which said that the man who lives at the ‘Mothers of Darkness Castle’in Belgium, Patrick Solvay, shareholder of the Solvay pharmaceutical, chemicaland plastics group, had a holding company called Itaca International that ownedthe European arm of the infant and child franchise network called ‘The LittleGym’, which operates in fifteen countries and provides children with ‘summer andholiday camps’. Is all this just coincidence?Uncle Ronnie’s Bedtime StoriesCathy O’Brien conceived a daughter called Kelly with her ‘husband’ Wayne Cox andsoon Kelly was being used in the same way as her mother. Kelly appears to be asignificant name to these people for some reason. I have met other recoveringmind-slaves with daughters of that name. Cathy says that Kelly was raped manytimes by Father George Bush and Dick Cheney and both mother and daughter wereforced to have sex with animals for videos made on the orders of PresidentRonald Reagan. ‘Uncle Ron’ liked nothing more than to watch these videos andthey were known as ‘Uncle Ronnie’s bedtime stories’. They were recorded andproduced, Cathy says, by his pornographer, Michael Danté (also known as MichaelViti). Danté had connections with the Mafia and CIA (same thing, mostly), andwas a close associate of politicians like Guy VanderJagt, Gerald Ford, DickThornburgh, then Governor of Pennsylvania, Jim Traficant and Gary Ackerman. Itwas Danté who installed the tiny hidden cameras that recorded the sexualactivities of US and foreign politicians, Cathy says, so they could beblackmailed into supporting the Orwellian agenda. How many ‘leaders’ today arefollowing certain policies against the interests of the people because, if theydidn’t, the evidence of their sexual exploits would be revealed? Large numbers,for sure. Bill Clinton was compromised in this way on one occasion by FatherGeorge Bush. It happened at the Lampe, Missouri, mind-control facility known asSwiss Villa. Bush ordered Kelly to perform oral sex on Clinton while Clinton wasdoing the same with Cathy. She recalls:> Clinton pushed his way out from under me and told Bush while he glanced around> for the camera: ‘You didn’t need to do that. I’m with you anyway. My position> does not need to be compromised’. Clinton was referring to the blackmail techniques and Cathy says:> World leaders were always compromised through covertly filmed bizarre sexual> activity as was my experience at the Bohemian Grove. After this encounter,> Bush and Clinton discussed introducing Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, to the> child abuse scene. Bush offered to ‘open her up’. Clinton said he would have> to discuss it with Hillary. Cathy writes that she and Kelly were also raped by Canadian Prime Minister,Brian Mulroney, who is addicted to sex with mind-controlled slaves. Mulroney wasextremely close to the Reagan–Bush cabal and he presented a eulogy at Reagan’sfuneral in June 2004. Mind-controlled mothers and young daughters were regularlytransported to Niagara Falls, just across the Canadian border, for Mulroney torape them. It was Mulroney in his period as Prime Minister who forced the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the people of Canada, a major step inthe Totalitarian Tiptoe to the American Union. The Agreement was manipulatedinto place by his friend and fellow child rapist, Father George Bush, and laterby Clinton. The people of Canada didn’t want it, but it was what the Reptilianhybrids decided was going to be – so too bad. Cathy says that Mulroney talkedabout the plan for the Orwellian state while he was with her and Reagan at aWhite House cocktail party, where she first met Clinton’s Secretary of State,Madeleine Albright. She was once described by Father Bush to Cathy as ‘…thereverend mother of all sisters (slaves)’. Albright said while in office that shewas shocked to find she had Jewish ancestry (Khazar/Sumerian). I bet she was.John Kerry had the same ‘surprise’ when he was running for president in 2004.The name ‘Kerry’ was really ‘Kohn’.After this White House party, Cathy was taken to a bedroom with other slaves,including one controlled by the US Senator Arlen Spector, the Khazar/Sumerianwho came up with the insane ‘magic bullet’ theory to explain away theassassination of President Kennedy. Brian Mulroney then arrived to rape themafter activating their sex slave programming. Cathy noticed that one of theslaves had a red rose tattooed on her left wrist and other people she met overthe years, including Mulroney, wore the symbol of the red rose. Cathy becameaware of an elite secret society called the ‘Order of the Rose’ whose initiatesincluded Mulroney, Father Bush, Clinton, Byrd and Trudeau, among many others.The ancient Greeks and Romans identified the rose with their goddesses Aphroditeand Venus (Semiramis) and it is often associated with the Virgin Mary (Semiramisagain). In Rome, a wild rose would be placed on the door of a room whereconfidential matters were discussed. The phrase sub rosa, or ‘under the rose’,means to keep a secret and comes from this ancient Roman practice. Howappropriate that when the British Labour Party began its transformation into‘New Labour’ under the manipulation of Blair minder Peter Mandelson, or Mr.Slither, its logo was changed from a red flag to a red rose.Under the orders of President Reagan’s personal attaché, Philip Habib, Cathysays she was forced to have sex on several occasions with King Fahd of SaudiArabia. The Saudi ‘royal family’ are puppets of the Reptilian conspiracy whilesuppressing their people with a brutal religion that they themselves do not evenbegin to observe. Cathy says that Father George Bush referred to the conspiracyas his ‘neighbourhood’ and talked of how he simply told many other world‘leaders’, including King Fahd, what to do and say. American mind-controlledslaves are ‘sold’ to Saudi Arabia, Mexico and other countries to help fundcovert operations and reward people for services provided. The long-time SaudiAmbassador to America, the quite appalling and desperately corrupt Prince Bandarbin Sultan, was closely involved with Bush. He went on to become Secretary-General of the Saudi National Security Council where he continues to serve theIlluminati agenda’s best interests.Vote Hillary?Cathy was so powerfully mind-controlled that she was ‘promoted’ to become whatis known as a ‘Presidential Model’, a mind-controlled slave who is detailed tooperate with the top people in the White House. She was used to pass messagesbetween Reagan, Bush and their foreign associates, such as the dictators, BabyDoc Duvalier of Haiti, President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico (who told her thestory of the ‘Iguana race’) and Manuel Noriega of Panama, the paid CIA operativeworking for the US government’s illegal drug trade. She also met HillaryClinton, the would-be first woman president, who performed oral sex on her.Hillary is another cocaine user (of course) and a lesbian. I have no problemwhatsoever with her sexuality – everyone to their own so long as they don’tforce it on others – but please spare us the cover story of ‘my husband Bill’.It is a marriage of political convenience, that’s all (Figure 229). Cathy, whohas a vaginal mutilation from her torture, met Hillary at a guest villa close tothe CIA Near Death Trauma Center in Lampe. The villa was owned by Bill Hall, theman Bill Clinton was persuading to join the drug-running operation in theexchange that I described earlier. Cathy says she was taken to Hillary by Hall’swife after Clinton had ordered her to leave his drugs meeting:Image [../Images/00238.jpg]Figure 229: The Clintons – as genuine as a five cent note > Hillary knew I was a mind-controlled slave, and, like Bill Clinton, just took> it in stride as a ‘normal’ part of life in politics. [She] was fully clothed> and stretched out on the bed sleeping when Hall’s wife and I arrived. > ‘Hillary, I brought you something you’ll really enjoy. Kind of an unexpected> surprise. Bill ordered her out of the meeting and I took her to my bedroom and> made an interesting discovery. She is literally a two-faced (referring to my> vaginal mutilation carving) bitch’. > ‘Hmm?’ Hillary opened her eyes and sleepily roused herself. ‘Show me’. Hall’s> wife ordered me to take my clothes off while Hillary watched. ‘Is she clean?’> Hillary asked, meaning disease free. > ‘Of course, she’s Byrd’s’, [Hall’s wife] responded, continuing the> conversation as though I were not there. ‘Plus, I heard Houston say something> about her being a Presidential Model, whatever the hell that’s supposed to> mean’. > ‘It means she’s clean’, Hillary said matter-of-factly as she stood up. > I was not capable of giving thought to such things back then, but I am aware> in retrospect that all Presidential Model slaves I knew seemed to have an> immunity to social diseases. It was a well known fact in the circles I was> sexually passed around in that government level mind-controlled sex slaves> were ‘clean’ to the degree that none of my abusers took precautions such as> wearing condoms. > Hall’s wife patted the bed and instructed me to display the mutilation.> Hillary exclaimed, ‘God!’ and immediately began performing oral sex on me.> Apparently aroused by the carving in my vagina, Hillary stood up and quickly> peeled out of her matronly nylon panties and pantyhose. Uninhibited despite a> long day in the hot Sun, she gasped, ‘Eat me, oh, god, eat me now’. I had no> choice but to comply with her orders, and Bill Hall’s wife made no move to> join me in my distasteful task. Hillary had resumed examining my hideous> mutilation and performing oral sex on me when Bill Clinton walked in. Hillary> lifted her head to ask, ‘How’d it go?’ > Clinton appeared totally unaffected by what he walked into, tossed his jacket> on a chair and said, ‘It’s official. I’m exhausted. I’m going to bed’. Think about what we are dealing with here, a two-term president and a would-bepresident.Country Boys …Cathy’s second designated ‘husband’, Alex Houston, was a rapist, paedophile anddrug-runner. He was also an ‘entertainer’, a ventriloquist and stage hypnotist,who himself had his mind and mouth worked by someone else – the US government’smind-control network. It was his job to maintain Cathy and daughter Kelly intheir programmed mode by following the instructions he was given. This includedfood and water deprivation and constant trauma. Houston used his travelling tovenues as a cover to transport Cathy and Kelly to their ‘assignments’. Itintroduced Cathy to the truth about the United States country music industry andthe ‘entertainment’ industry in general. Country music, she discovered, was usedby government agencies to distribute massive amounts of drugs into Americansociety and as a cover for its mind control projects. It was these agencies, shesays, which paid for the promotion and hype that turned a singer called BoxcarWillie into a country music ‘star’. Some of this promotion, Cathy says, took theform of high-tech television commercials designed to have a hypnotic effect onthe viewer. He became the leader of the country music segment of the ‘FreedomTrain’ – the internationally recognised code name for the slave operations ofProject Monarch. Cathy names Boxcar Willie as a paedophile rapist ofmind-controlled women and children, including Kelly, whom he raped regularly inthree different mental institutions. He was also heavily involved in the cocaineoperations controlled by the government and he was the man Bill Clinton’sfriend, Bill Hall, began to work with after Clinton persuaded him to becomeinvolved. It was Boxcar Willie who inspired the moving of the country music‘capital’ to Branson, Missouri, to be close to the CIA mind control and drugsoperation based at Lampe, Missouri.Many people in the entertainment industry are either connected with theconspiracy, or mind-controlled by it. One of the latter was Marilyn Monroe, a‘lover’ of President John F. Kennedy. Both were to be murdered by the sameforce. Princess Diana was the same and their personalities can begin to comeapart when the programming starts to break down. When I see the singer, BritneySpears, she seems to me to show many signs of a programmed mind unravelling. Theactor and singer, Kris Kristopherson, a drug-addicted alcoholic born into a CIAfamily, was also involved as a seriously imbalanced controller andmind-manipulator of slaves, according to Cathy’s book and public statements. Shewrites that she was tortured by him and the Temple of Set’s Michael Aquino usinghigh voltage electric shocks. Kristopherson, yet another Jesuit, was anassociate of Senator Robert C. Byrd, Cathy’s controller. Cathy says of him inher book: ‘… Kristopherson nearly strangled me to death with his penis, whichhad further sexually excited him, late in the summer of 1987 during anotherincident related to Byrd.’ The rock and roll ‘legend’, Jerry Lee Lewis, was adrug-runner and killer for the government and Cathy says she was threatened onmany occasions with the words: ‘We’ll sell you to Jerry Lee’.Escape and exposure (which the media ignored)When the slaves outlive their usefulness, or their programming begins to breakdown, they are murdered. Presidential Models like Cathy O’Brien are normally notallowed to live beyond their thirtieth year and when that came for Cathy in1987/88, she was told it was her last year of life. Fortunately, she and thethen eight-year-old Kelly would be rescued from death by a businessman calledMark Phillips. He had a considerable knowledge of advanced mind-controltechniques from his time working for the Ampex Corporation and the US Departmentof Defense as a civilian subcontractor. This allowed him contact with leadingresearch scientists in this field and gave him access to knowledge that isdenied to the mainstream psychiatric profession. Psychiatrists, like doctors andscientists, are also mind-manipulated by the suppression of information, whichgives them a distorted picture of what is possible. Mark Phillips was thought tobe ‘safe’ with his background and security clearance, and he was approached byAlex Houston for support with a business opportunity. Houston was now the‘handler’ of Cathy and Kelly and he married Cathy at the instruction of hercontroller, Senator Byrd. Phillips says he worked with Houston on the businessdeal, involving Hong Kong and China, but he was told by a representative of theChinese Ministry of Defence about Houston’s background and his involvement withthe CIA, drugs, money laundering, child prostitution and … slavery. Phillips’sinformant, who produced documentary proof, said Houston was a ‘very bad man’ andthat his crimes were ‘of the White House’. Mark Phillips writes inTrance-Formation Of America:> My first response to this ‘officer’ was that Houston was too stupid and> crooked to be connected with US ‘intelligence’. This comment was quickly> countered with a gut wrenching photograph of Houston. He was smiling a demonic> grin while apparently having anal sex with a small, very young, frightened> black boy. Later he was identified to me as being Haitian. Phillips made contact with an old friend, now dead, who had been an Air Forcegeneral in the intelligence division and maintained close connections with theupper levels of US and foreign intelligence. The general told him about the CIAslave trade worldwide and that Cathy and Kelly had been subjected totrauma-based mind-control. Mark Phillips recalls:> I was growing numb. The first words out of my dry mouth were: ‘How would you> spring these people out of it?’ > He smiled and said: ‘I wouldn’t! What are you going to do with them if you get> them out?’ > Before I could answer, he interrupted and said: ‘Look. You’re still the same,> but nothing else is with Uncle [the USA]. Now most of the CIA, FBI, and the> MOB [Mafia] are the same, and they’re making moves on the military’. Phillips was insistent that he wanted to attempt a rescue and his friend gavehim the mind-controlling codes that would activate Cathy to go with him. Thefull and detailed story is told in Trance-Formation of America. Phillips tookthem to Alaska while leaving messages for the authorities that he had nointention of exposing the truth. He said he would ‘… take them to Alaska andplay like a voiceless chameleon’. This, as he hoped, probably spared their livesat this stage. They have also been helped by many good people in intelligencewho want to root out the evil. There is an internal ‘war’ unfolding within theintelligence community between the Reptilian hybrids and those who can see whatis happening. In Alaska, Mark Phillips used his knowledge, with covert supportfrom his contacts, to deprogramme Cathy’s compartmentalised mind. This immensetask absorbed almost every spare waking moment month after month after month.Attempts were made by CIA mind controller, Dr Louis Jolyon West at theUniversity of California, and his associates, to take Kelly from Cathy and Mark,but, all these years later, she is now back with them. Jolyon West was the manwho gave a ‘mental assessment’ to Timothy McVeigh when he was arrested for thebombing in Oklahoma in 1995 (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade CenterDisaster for the story of Oklahoma, another Reptilian hybridProblem-Reaction-Solution). Cathy and Mark have had their lives threatened manytimes, but they have refused to keep quiet and have sent their information, withdocumented and sometimes audio tape support, to a long list of US politicians,government agencies and pressure groups. The reaction has been mostly silence.They have also produced the books Trance-Formation of America and Access Denied,and have spoken extensively at public meetings all over North America. This hasprobably kept them alive because to remove them would merely confirm that whatthey say is true. If Cathy’s claims are not true, where is the legal actionagainst her and the book? Most of the names involved are so enormously wealthythat the cost of such an action would be no trouble. Why the silence in the faceof allegations as grave and extreme as these?Georgie’s friendSome of what really goes on at the White House and other famous locations(though a very mild version of it) threatened to break publicly in 2005 with thecase of ‘Jeff Gannon’. Soon, however, the lid was desperately screwed downagain. ‘Jeff Gannon’ was a member of the White House press corps working for awebsite called Talon News. When he began to ask Boy Bush biased, soft and easyquestions, some reporters looked into his background. They discovered that hisname was not ‘Jeff Gannon’, but James Dale Guckert, a gay escort and prostitutewho used naked pictures of himself to sell his wares at websites likeHotmilitarystud.com [http://Hotmilitarystud.com] and Militaryescorts4m.com[http://Militaryescorts4m.com] (Figure 230). Some politicians demanded to seethe records of how Gannon/Guckert secured his White House media pass andRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee said memorably that Gannon had engaged in apossible ‘penetration of the White House’. More than the White House, I wouldwager. Secret Service records show that Gannon/Guckert slept at the White Houseon some twelve occasions and visited the building at least thirty-two times whenthere was no press conference or press event. No explanation for this has beengiven, but it is clear from the way Bush greeted Gannon that they knew eachother very well (Figure 231). Reports have also suggested that Tony Blair was‘entertained’ by Gannon on July 17th 2003 while the British Prime Minister wason a visit to Washington. I have no problem whatsoever with consenting adultsengaging in gay relationships, but just cut the crap with the cover-story wives.One reason why there are so many homosexuals among the Reptilian hybridbloodlines is that fathers have sex with sons when they are children and thislocks them into that expression of sexuality, as well as creating an energeticand emotional bond of domination by the father that can last a lifetime. PhillipEugene de Rothschild said that he was ‘held fast in the emotional power ofincest, which, in this culture, was normal and to be admired’. There is no wayin the world that Boy Bush was not sexually abused by his father, or ‘opened up’as he likes to put it.Image [../Images/00239.jpg]Figure 230: ‘James Dale Guckert, alias ‘Jeff Gannon’, advertising for clients Image [../Images/00240.jpg]Figure 231: Bush and Gannon: close friends How the military is mind-controlledThe themes that Cathy O’Brien and so many others describe are supported by KayGriggs, the wife of US Marine Corps Colonel, George Griggs, who was head ofNATO’s Psychological Operations. She was astounded to learn from her husband,his diary, her own observations and others she met, the astonishing secretbackground to US military leadership training, drugs and arms running,mind-control and the worldwide network of camps where they train professionalassassins. She was even more shocked to find out that sex with children andhomosexual rape was the ‘norm’ at the highest levels of the military, and alsoinvolved top politicians like Henry Kissinger. He is named by Kay Griggs as apaedophile rapist of young boys and young men. She says that she met one contactshe calls ‘Bob’, who described how he was raped by Kissinger in a tent inCambodia. ‘Bob’ was told: ‘If you ever tell anyone, it’s the end of you’. I haveheard about paedophile Kissinger from many sources and here is yet anotherprominent Reptilian hybrid with a cover-story marriage. After finding herhusband’s diary, Kay began to ask questions of her friends at the Military WivesClub and many told her that they also knew what went on. In hours of interviewsrecorded in 1998, Kay Griggs reveals that this ‘culture’ is rife among seniormilitary figures.Kay says there are homosexual initiation rites for Marines and others in themilitary that include oral and anal sex while the initiate lies in a coffin.This is similar to the initiation ceremonies for the Skull and Bones Societybecause they’re all connected. She said that her husband described what happenedas ‘like a zoo’. They get the men and boys steaming drunk for the homosexualinitiation rituals that are referred to by names such as ‘Dining in’. ‘Noteverybody does it, but those who do, they get right up to the top’, she says.‘If they are in special operations, in the Marines, they’ve all done it – it’slike the fast road to the top’. They use these homosexual escapades to blackmailtheir top military people into compliance with the Reptilian hybrid agenda, andthey recruit ‘emotionally weak boys’ for top jobs, Kay Griggs said, mostly fromleading families. Her husband told her: ‘They nurture – they cultivate – thesons of prominent families. They’re called “rising stars”. They rope them in.Then they turn them’. Kay said they have ‘little boys that they pick out’ andthey call them ‘special’. They look for boys who are suffering from lowself-esteem and mental disorders to be ‘trained’ to become the military ‘elite’.They can then be controlled (including mind-controlled) by the Illuminatioperatives. Kay Griggs said her husband was deeply mind-controlled and, onceagain, this was the ‘norm’ throughout the military:> What my husband does for a living is train mercenaries – young boys from> countries like Romania, Dominican Republic, Haiti. They’re training them to be> murderers, and the taxpayers’ dollars are paying for this. They> psychologically profile them. The profile is similar to my husband’s and Lee> Harvey Oswald’s and [Timothy] McVeigh’s, and others who were all part of this> program. [Serial killer] Jeffrey Dahmer was part of this program. They’re all> Army. They were all picked out because they were perverted or twisted. [The> military profiles for] strong mother, weak father, no father, poor. Because> these guys are looking for security, they will stay in the military and do> anything for that security. > When you work in the White House, you work under the Army. The Marines have no> overlord, as such. They can float. They’re run out of New Orleans, just like> Oswald was. Oswald was homosexually recruited by Jack Rubinstein, who was Jack> Ruby [the man who shot him after his arrest for assassinating Kennedy]. All of> the funding for these operations goes through the ‘joint’ – the Mob. Oswald> was a loner, brilliant – and a perfect candidate. His [profile] and my> husband’s profile almost look alike. Kay Griggs says that the United States military was taken over by the hundredsof Nazis who arrived after World War Two. They were relocated to America throughthe networks of the Zionists and the Roman Church (same thing). ‘They took withthem the most perverted aspects of Nazi Germany and brought them over to theUnited States’, she said. The Mafia, or ‘the Mob’, is another Church of Romeoperation and Kay said that any genuine people are prevented from progressing inthe military, leaving only those who will serve the Mob. As she put it:> They get rid of the good guys. The Marine Corps are the assassins for the Mob.> The military is run by the Mob. The military is the Mob. It’s very German, it> has Masonic leanings. They’re all Masons. This Brotherhood – Opus Dei –> they’re the Mob. The Marine Corps are the hit men. They’re mercenaries.> They’ll work for anybody. They’ll switch hats. My husband said it’s no big> deal. Kay Griggs said she learned that the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and USSpecial Operations were controlling much of the Contra terrorism againstNicaragua from Honduras under Reagan–Bush in the 1980s, as I outlined earlier.She said they were working with CIA and National Security Council teams and a USmilitary group called the ISA (Intelligence Special Activity) to ship hundredsof millions in drug money to Mafia-controlled ports such as New Orleans andMiami. This also connected into the Bush–Clinton operation at Mena and enormousamounts of money were laundered through Fort Meade, Maryland, headquarters forthe National Security Agency. She said the operatives for these operations aretrained at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which was headed by Army General CarlStiner, whom Kay Griggs describes as an ‘evil man’. She says that he, and MarineGeneral Jim Joy, trained ‘the men in black who killed those people at Waco’.Michael Canavan, the head of security for the Federal Aviation Administration onSeptember 11th, was Commanding General, Joint Special Operations Command, at thesame Fort Bragg. Kay Griggs said:> The Marine Corps is just a smoke-and-mirrors thing. On [my husband’s] level,> he said we’ve never been an enemy to the Soviet Union. They work with these> Communists.

You can seeeight hours of interviews with Kay Griggs at www.kaygriggstalks.com[http://www.kaygriggstalks.com].A global sicknessWhat I am describing here is not just happening in the United States and Canada.It’s going on all over the world and nowhere more so than in Britain and Europe,where leading politicians and the pillars of banking, business, law andentertainment take part in their satanic, black magic rituals and mind-controlprogrammes. British Intelligence is massively involved in mind control andSatanism and I know from contacts that the last two heads of MI5, StellaRimington and Eliza Manningham-Buller, were both products of the mind controlprogrammes and later perpetrators of them. The same with John Scarlett, the maninvolved in the Blair ‘dodgy dossier’ on the threat from Iraq, who was rewardedfor his complicity by being made head of MI6 in 2003. Famous televisionpolitical presenters, actors, writers, theatre producers and others wereinvolved in the same British Intelligence ‘training’ and mind controlprogrammes, some of which were centred at one time in the old Powergen buildingat Solihull in the English West Midlands. Other locations include the Ministryof Defence’s Fort Monkton, near Gosport in Hampshire. MI6 were forced to paycompensation to victims of its mind manipulation programme involving the drugLSD, but that is an infinitesimal fraction of what it is involved in. I also seea mass of mind control symbolism in the Harry Potter books and films. All theelements I am highlighting – mind-control, bloodline, shapeshifting, Reptiliansymbolism and imagery, can be found in abundance in the Harry Potter stories ofBritish writer, J.K. Rowling. These have now been read, or seen in movie-form,by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, mostly children.I have talked and corresponded with so many people across the world who haveexperienced these horrors of mind control and Satanism and their stories, andother accounts I have read, tell of events that are beyond comprehension. Or, atleast they would be if they were not actually happening. Drinking blood, eatingthe flesh of dead bodies, thousands of adults and children buried in deepgraves, the murder of people on camera for the so called ‘snuff’ videos, theevil is incredible. One mother told a television documentary in the Dispatchesseries on Channel 4 in Britain of how she was forced to place her new born babyon a satanic altar and push a knife through its heart. A Satanist then had sexwith the baby’s dead body. This is happening in your country now and some of themost famous and powerful are doing it because they are of the Nefilim bloodlinewho have been doing this for thousands of years. Father George Bush encapsulatesthe levels of evil and lack of empathy that are necessary to cause suchsuffering and not give a damn. Cathy describes what Bush did to her littledaughter, Kelly, again and again:> Kelly became violently physically ill after her induction into George Bush’s> ‘Neighbourhood’ and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter.> She ran 104-6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilising headaches> for an average of three days (as is consistent with high voltage trauma).> These were the only tell-tale evidences aside from the scarring burns left on> her skin. Houston forbade me to call a doctor, and Kelly forbade me to comfort> her, pitifully complaining that her head ‘hurt too bad even to move’. And she> did not move for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain,> and her rectum usually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her.> My own mind control victimisation rendered me unable to help or protect her.> Seeing my child in such horrible condition drove my own wedge of insanity in> deeper, perpetuating my total inability to affect her needs until our rescue> by Mark Phillips in 1988. > Kelly’s bleeding rectum was but one of many physical indicators of George> Bush’s paedophile perversions. I have overheard him speak blatantly of his> sexual abuse of her on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to> ‘pull my strings’ and control me. The psychological ramifications of being> raped by a paedophile president are shattering enough, but reportedly Bush> further reinforced his traumas to Kelly’s mind with sophisticated NASA> electronic and drug mind-control devices. Bush also instilled the ‘Who ya> gonna call?’ and ‘I’ll be watching you’ binds on Kelly, further reinforcing> her sense of helplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I endured as a> child now seem trite in comparison to the brutal physical and psychological> devastation that George Bush inflicted on my daughter. I have outlined just a fraction of what there is to tell about the mind controloperations and satanic network and, as I have already indicated, mind control isnot confined to individuals at secret locations. The idea is to control theminds and emotions of the entire population through ‘education’, microchipping,the media and other means. Cathy says that she heard Reagan and Bush insist thatthe only way to ‘world peace’ is the ‘mind control of the masses’. She was ableto observe the planning of the Reptilian hybrid project called ‘Education 2000’while under the control of another sexual abuser who programmed herself andKelly. This was Bill Bennett, a Jesuit-trained mind-controller, who became USEducation Secretary under Reagan–Bush. He was replaced by his associate, LamarAlexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, with whom Cathy says she was forcedto take part in a satanic ritual in an affluent area of Nashville. BillBennett’s brother, Bob, is also alleged to have raped Kelly at the BohemianGrove in 1986 and later became ‘legal counsel’ to Bill Clinton. Cathy was usedto compromise and provide ‘favours’ for key politicians to ensure support forEducation 2000 and she learned that this project, also known as America 2000 andGlobal 2000, was designed to increase children’s ‘learning’ capacity whiledestroying their ability to critically think for themselves.These programmes, and others, are being introduced everywhere in thiscoordinated global conspiracy to control the human mind."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 24 Whose world in your head? > It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education. > Albert Einstein Most people have no idea how they are bombarded with mind control programmingand triggers throughout their waking day, and even during sleep. Nor, do theyunderstand the level of potential and sophistication that such techniques andtechnology have now reached.But why would they? They are programmed not to know, just as people like CathyO’Brien had no idea she was mind controlled even when it was happening to herevery day. Mind control is putting the thoughts and beliefs of others into yourhead and it operates on multi-levels. If I tell you something knowing it to beuntrue and that affects your perception and behaviour, I have subjected you tomind control. I have manipulated your thoughts. Every time you watch televisionor read a paper or magazine this is happening, and every advertisement isdesigned to control your thought and emotional patterns to the point where youbuy whatever is being peddled. I have seen advertising copywriters and producersdubbed the ‘persuaders’, but that’s a bit like calling an axe murderer ‘a manwho works with tools’. It doesn’t tell the full story. The ‘persuaders’ isNewspeak for mind manipulators. Subliminal messages that speak to thesubconscious, calculated emotional triggers and using certain words to glean aspecific reaction is not persuasion, it is invasion – an invasion of our senseof perception.Such techniques have been with us for thousands of years (at least) in the senseof manipulating thoughts and emotions to dictate behaviour, but we are now in anew and far more advanced era of thought dictatorship. A London-based companycalled Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) is clear about the benefitsthat it offers its customers, which include transnational corporations, themilitary, police, governments and the United Nations. The SCL, funded by what itcalls British-based ‘private high net worth individuals’, is in the business ofselling mind control. One of its projects is the Behavioural Dynamics Institute,which is claimed to be ‘the world’s leading authority on persuasion,communication psychology and public diplomacy’. The SCL website says:> The last 5 years have seen a flurry of Homeland Security scenarios enacted and> re-enacted on the streets of our cities. What if there is a biological attack,> or the detonation of multiple explosive devices? However, a major flaw has> emerged in many of the scenarios – the unmanageability of civilians.

When terrorists are looking for a target, it is the> predictability of civilian behaviour that makes the terrorists’ job easier.> What if there was a way to control civilian behaviour when it counts? Imagine> the benefits of having civilians as cooperating partners. Strategic> Communication makes the people part of the solution, not part of the problem. The company proposes to overcome this ‘problem’ of people not acting as desiredby creating an ‘OpCentre’ to put the ‘influence, control and power back into thehands of the government and military, giving them greater power to influence theenemy in time of conflict and enhanced access to their citizens during acrisis’. An Opcentre, it tells us, can be designed to override all nationalradio and TV broadcasts, allowing the government and military to communicatewith the public as the need arises. It can take control of financial markets,health agencies and foreign affairs, engender support by the masses for militaryaction and ‘develop national resilience and behavioural compliance for homelandsecurity issues’. The Orwellian language is straight from the pages of 1984 andincludes OpCentre ‘modules’ called ‘Word-of-Mouth Units’ and ‘Cultural AlignmentUnits’. The company says it can deliver a strategic and operational ‘psyop’(mind control) campaign and a Homeland Security Centre for any country orculture. The OpCenter can suppress public unrest and stop insurgency and othersuch ‘public affairs crises’, under a ‘counter-terrorism programme’:> Almost every country suffers from some problematic faction within its> citizens. These disaffected groups may be driven by religious fervour,> self-importance or just greed. In all cases, their ability to operate and> recruit new members depends on the perceptual environment and the levels of> tolerance of the state and its citizens. SCL specialises in producing> solutions for governments so that they can significantly increase their> control and management of disaffected groups as part of a wider> counter-terrorism programme. For control and management of disaffected groups, read control and management ofthose challenging the imposition of the global fascist state. Former KGBofficer, General Boris Ratnikov, who served in the KGB department for Moscow andthe Moscow region, told the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta that people in powerhad resorted to various methods of manipulating the thoughts of the populationsince ancient times. He said the secret services had acquired the ‘scientificfoundation’ for this in the 20th century. ‘You can hardly imagine the warfarethat broke out in this area in the first half of the last century. It wouldhardly be an exaggeration to say that sometimes real “astral battles” tookplace,’ Ratnikov told the paper. He said that by the mid-1980s around fiftyresearch institutes in the Soviet Union studied remote mind control techniquesbacked by substantial government funding. He even said that when he was deputyhead and senior consultant at the Federal Guard Service from 1991 to 1997, hisdepartment was in charge of safeguarding top officials in post-Soviet Russia,including President Boris Yeltsin, against any external influence on theirsubconscious minds. The general claimed to have used mind-reading technology onforeign officials.Thought trackingEven some newspapers have begun to spasmodically question what is happening,although depressingly few. One, ironically, has been the London Observer. I say‘ironically’, because in around 1996-97 I told a ‘journalist’ from the Observerabout government mind control programmes and the experiences of Cathy O’Brien.He called it ‘the story of the century’. I offered to put him in contact withvictims who could confirm what I said and gave him my phone number. He didn’tcall. Instead, he wrote an article the following week attacking me and what I dowith all the usual bollocks such people come up with. Years later the same paperran a story under the headline: ‘We are moving ever closer to the era of mindcontrol’. I challenge the word ‘moving’, however, because we have long beenthere. Dr George Estabrooks, Chairman of the Colgate University Department ofPsychology and advisor to the military on hypnosis, said back in the 1940s: ‘Ican hypnotise a man – without his knowledge or consent – into committing treasonagainst the United States’. So they can and do. At least the Observer articleshowed that some eyes are beginning to open to the obvious. It was written bySteven Rose, Professor of Biology at the Open University, and highlighted thesinister nature of the new mind technologies. Once you realise that the humanbody is a biological computer and the brain is the central processing unit ofthe computer, mind control can be simply understood. It is a biological versionof computer programming. You download instructions onto the hard drive and thecomputer (via the brain/CPU) responds accordingly. That is, unless your higherlevels of consciousness kick in and wrest the keyboard from the hacker.Professor Rose writes:> Brain scientists are on a roll. Concern about rising levels of mental distress> have resulted in unprecedented levels of funding in the US and Europe. And a> range of new technologies, from genetics to brain imaging, are offering> extraordinary insights into the molecular and cellular processes underlying> how we see, how we remember, why we become emotional. > Brain imaging has become familiar. Scanners, known by their initials – CAT,> PET, MRI – began as clinical tools, enabling surgeons to identify potential> tumours, the damage following a stroke or the diagnostic signs of incipient> dementia. But neuroscientists quickly seized on their wider potential. The> images of regions of the brain ‘lighting up’ when a person is thinking of> their lover, imagining travelling from home to the shops, or solving a> mathematical problem, have captured the imagination of researchers and public> alike. What if they could do more? Oh, but they can. The ‘unprecedented levels of funding in the US and Europe’ arenothing to do with ‘rising levels of mental distress’. The Reptilians aremanipulating the mental distress to produce their energy source and they wantmore, not less. The funding is there to speed the introduction of technologiesto control the minds of the people. If you followed the electrical signals in acomputer you would see different parts ‘light up’ – become active – whendifferent instructions are keyed in. The brain is the same, albeit infinitelymore sophisticated. Rose says that he published the results of an experimentthat looked at the regions of the brain that became active when people chosebetween competing products in supermarkets. Major companies, he said, rangingfrom Coca-Cola to BMW, are starting to image the brains of potential customersto study how they respond to new designs or brands. They are beginning to speakof ‘neuromarketing’ and ‘neuroeconomics’, Rose points out. What we are lookingat here is the commercial use of technology also designed to identify peopleguilty of what George Orwell calls crimethink in 1984. Crimethink was a ‘thoughtcrime’ – having thoughts that were at odds with the government line. To statethe obvious, Crimethink requires the ability to read the thoughts of the‘perpetrator’ and, while it may not have been available at the time Orwell wroteof the Big Brother society – it is now. Professor Rose says of brain imagingtechnology:> Such trends may be relatively innocuous, but the increasing state interest in> what the images might reveal is less so. Specifically, what if brain imaging> could predict future behaviour, or indicate guilt or innocence of a crime?> There are claims, for example, that it could reveal potential ‘psychopathy’,> that the brains of men convicted of brutal murders show significantly abnormal> patterns [get the Bushes, Clintons and Blair wired up immediately]. > In the current legislative climate, where there have been attempts to> introduce pre-emptive detention for ‘psychopaths’ who have not yet been> convicted of any crime, such claims need to be addressed critically. They are> and will be resisted by the judiciary, but recent developments suggest that> this may be a frail defence against an increasingly authoritarian state. Thinking your thoughtsAn American company has developed what it calls ‘brain-fingerprinting’. Itclaims it can ‘determine the truth regarding a crime, terrorist activities orterrorist training by detecting information stored in the brain’. This is doneby measuring the electrical signals in the brain and the company says that itsmethods have been accepted as evidence in US courts. The aim is not just to readminds for thought crime, but to change and manipulate the way people think. Fordecades the US military has been funding the development of techniques andtechnologies that can both ‘read the minds’ of enemy troops (the population) andchange their perception of events. Much of the funding of research anddevelopment contracts with transnational corporations has been channelledthrough the sinister Defence Advanced Projects Agency, or DARPA, and thisprogramme has become rampant since the dawn of the bogus ‘war on terror’.Professor Rose goes on:> The step beyond reading thoughts is to attempt to control them directly. A new> technique – transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) – has begun to generate> interest. This focuses an intense magnetic field on specific brain regions,> and has been shown to affect thoughts, perceptions and behaviour. There are> suggestions it could be used to control obsessive-compulsive behaviour, while> some even take seriously the scenario envisaged in the film, Eternal Sunshine> of the Spotless Mind, in which TMS was used to erase unwanted memories of a> love affair gone wrong. > Currently only possible if a subject’s head is put inside the relevant> machine, TMS at a distance is now under active military investigation. So is> chip technology, which might provide implanted prostheses to overcome sensory> deficits or control behaviour, and whose potential bioethics committees around> Europe have been scrutinising. (My emphasis) > It is tempting to dismiss all these as technological fantasies and their> proponents as sellers of snake oil, but the fact that a technology is faulty> doesn’t mean it won’t be used. One only has to think of the tens of thousands> of lobotomies carried out on schizophrenic patients in the past century.> Britain is one of the world’s leading examples of a surveillance society,> observing its citizens through CCTV cameras and controlling their behaviour> with Asbos [Anti-social behaviour orders introduced by Blair] and Ritalin. The> potential for surveillance of citizen’s thoughts has moved far beyond the> visions of 1984. At the top of the global pyramid, the military and transnational corporationsare all the same network singing from the same song sheet and while it may seemthat ‘individual’ companies and corporations are bringing these technologies tothe ‘marketplace’, it is a calculated and long-planned assault on the humanpsyche, orchestrated by the Reptilian hierarchy and coordinated through thehighest and hidden levels of the military. Our entire society is based on mindcontrol at its various levels of expression. Planet Earth is the land of thezombie – but it doesn’t have to be. Professor Rose says that neuroscientistshave a responsibility to make their subject and its potential as transparent aspossible and the voices of concerned citizens should not be heard ‘downstream’when the technologies are already fully formed, but ‘upstream’ while the scienceis still in progress. We have to find ways of ensuring that such voices arelistened to through the cacophony of slogans about ‘better brains’, he says, and‘the power of the military and the market’. In an open and just society he wouldbe right, but in this one he is wasting his voice and his ink. What he rightlydemands is not going to happen unless we act together, because those controllingthe system want the opposite.Are you receiving me?I saw a film called Control Factor, released in 2003, which tells the story ofLance Bishop, a thirty-three-year-old American insurance salesman. He begins tohear voices in his head telling him to perform violent acts. He eventuallylearns that he is part of a mind control experiment which, once perfected, wouldbe used to control the masses through broadcasts from a network of mastspositioned all over the towns and cities. It would tell the population what tothink, how to feel and how to vote. From my research over the years it is clearthat, as with so many movies, this is basically fact presented as sci-fi. In thesmall town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight where I live, one of these masts isalready in place a few hundred yards from my home, and they are appearing allover the country with the goal of doing the same across Europe and the widerworld. It is a system known as TETRA, or ‘Terrestrial Trunked Radio’ (Figure232). The cover story is that TETRA is just a new communications system forpolice and other emergency services, but that is only one level of this systemand, to the Reptilian hybrids, by far the least important. The real reason forTETRA is mass mind control and the technology is similar to the PCS/Digital, orPersonal Communication Systems, used in the United States. What I am going tosay here about TETRA applies to systems at work in other parts of the world andTETRA itself is planned to expand globally. It was used for communications atthe Athens Olympics in 2004, for instance.Image [../Images/00241.jpg]Figure 232: A TETRA mast The British Home Office awarded the contract for TETRA, known as the ‘Airwavecontract’, to a consortium headed by British Telecom, and it was sold on to 02and their subsidiary mm02. The American giant, Motorola, is also involved inmaking an important component of the TETRA system and this is a company withclose links to the National Security Agency, or NSA, which is a fundamental cogin the US mind-control network and boss to the CIA. A contact tells me that thetechnology was actually given to Motorola by the NSA and that would certainlyfit the picture of how it’s done. What we call the military/industrial complexis just that – the fusion of the military and the corporate through whichtechnology developed in the secret projects to advance human control is broughtinto the public arena by the military supplying a connected corporation with theknow-how. This is then sold to the public as a ‘breakthrough’ discovered by thecompany itself. An internal European Union document warns of a ‘major risk thatcould result from the omnipresence of US companies that supply radiocommunication equipment to the European police forces’. The document came fromthe Scientific and Technological Options Assessment, which answers to theEuropean Parliament, and it stressed its serious concerns at the domination byAmerican companies of emergency communications networks in Europe. The documentreveals that Motorola played a crucial role in defining the TETRA Europeanstandard (in collaboration with the National Security Agency) in order toguarantee for the US government the possibility that TETRA networks could beeavesdropped. It also says that Poland has been offered a Motorola network forits police force and the document warns: ‘It is urgent that the future membersof the Union carefully evaluate the risks of a too large reliance on atechnology for which they have no guarantee’. Especially, they might have added,when the system is not even efficient. Such is the frequency pulsing of TETRAthat the radios need to be turned off near life support equipment, and even nearbreathalysers or vehicle speed check equipment, because of the interference theycause. There was also the example of a bus with an electronically-controlledgearbox that changed gear when passengers in certain seats used a cell phone.These technologies interfere with others and, most importantly, they disrupthuman brain and DNA function.Ultimately, it is not even about eavesdropping, though that is part of it, ofcourse. The main reason is mass mind control and the health effects have thepotential to make people seriously ill and scramble our physical, mental andemotional energy fields. The TETRA system is untested for health effects(publicly tested that is) and the corporations involved with these technologiesuse the mantra that we have heard so often when challenged about its dangers.They say there is no proven evidence or ‘conclusive evidence’ that it isharmful. Three points to make here:> 1)How can there be ‘proven evidence’ when these conniving companies and> governments refuse to publicly test for health effects before imposing it on> the people, and when they ignore or dismiss independent studies that expose> the flaws and dangers?> 2)When a TETRA system is switched on and people living or working nearby> become ill (when they don’t know about the switch-on), how can this not be> considered evidence of a link?> 3)Why is something allowed to be introduced on the grounds that there is ‘no> proven evidence’ that it is not safe when surely the onus should be on the> company to first show that it is safe?Research scientist, Barrie Trower, wrote a major report exposing TETRA and, inthis section, he addressed the subject of ‘conclusive proof’ and the nonsensethat it is:> The Government’s scientists will often ask for conclusive proof when they are> challenged. It is a word often used when you wish to win your side of the> argument. Scientifically conclusive proof is impossible to obtain – let me> explain. I was at a legal hearing in Torquay representing a community and the> barrister representing the communications industry said ‘there is no> conclusive proof that these microwaves will cause damage’. > I argued: if somebody stood up and shot me in this courtroom there would be> three levels of proof. You would have everybody as a witness and that would be> accepted in a Court of Law. A pathologist could perform a post mortem, decide> that the bullet killed me and that would be a second level of proof. If,> however, you wanted conclusive proof that the bullet killed me, you would have> to argue that at the split second the bullet went into my body every system in> my body was working perfectly because there are thousands of reasons why I> could drop dead on the spot before the bullet went in and you would have to> prove conclusively that all of these systems were working perfectly before the> bullet went in. > Clearly, this is scientifically impossible; there is no such thing as> conclusive proof, yet it is what is demanded by government scientists when> challenging their decisions. Hacking the computerIn ‘journalism’ there is a saying that goes ‘don’t let too many phone callsspoil a good story’ – don’t check its validity too keenly or you might find thatthe story is not true. The corporate–government conspiracy has something similarwhen it comes to checking the effects of its technology: ‘Don’t do too muchpublic research or you’ll show people that it’s dangerous’. Instead, let peoplesuffer and die, it’s much better for business and the agenda, so long as yousuppress the cause of their suffering and death. The ludicrously-named NationalRadiation ‘Protection’ Board is supposed to ensure that the population isprotected from damaging radiation. But it admits: ‘No epidemiological study asyet has explored the risks associated with telecommunications systems such asTETRA which use RF radiation modulated at frequencies around 16Hz’. It says that‘Human volunteer studies should be carried out’. All this after the technologyis already active. The Home Office has commissioned a study by the ImperialCollege, London, to record the effects on police officers over a period of tenyears – turning police officers into laboratory rats. Even this study, involvingvested interests, will only look at the effect of police handsets and not thebroadcasts from the TETRA masts themselves. The National Radiation ‘Protection’Board subcontracted its ‘research’ into the effects of microwave radiation to DrCamelia Gabriel and her Microwave Consultants Limited. Dr Gabriel was also asenior consultant for mobile phone giant, Orange plc, and she jointly wrote theOrange Base Stations Health and Safety Manual. Her son, also of MicrowaveConsultants Limited, says the transmitters for Orange plc in school playgroundsare ‘safe’. This is the military–industrial–governmental complex at work witheach element watching the back of the others.The Stewart Committee, chaired by Sir William Stewart, reported to the UKgovernment in May 2000 that there was compelling evidence that mobile phoneshave biological effects on humans, even where the radio frequency or microwaveradiation is emitted at very low levels. Children, the report said, were most atrisk because their skulls are thinner, which allows their brains to absorb moreradiation while their cell growth and brain wave activity are still developing.The Stewart Committee advised against using any communication instruments thatpulsed above sixteen waves per second. TETRA pulses at 17.6 waves per second. Toconfirm the real agenda of the National Radiation ‘Protection’ Board, it waslater revealed that it had suppressed information requested by the StewartCommittee about the effect on child health of mobile phone frequencies.Meanwhile, major insurance companies who are watching the bottom line, includingtwo of the world’s biggest, Lloyds and Swiss Re, have advised that there beexclusion clauses against paying compensation for illnesses caused by continuouslong-term low level radiation. This was on the advice of Dr Theodore Litivitz,Professor Emeritus of Physics at the Catholic University of America. In theUnited States, such ‘safety’ matters are ‘regulated’ by thegovernment-controlled Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that has beenderegulating away the media to fewer and fewer corporations. The ‘standards’ itfollows were developed by private organisations, the American National StandardsInstitute and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The FCC washeaded until 2005 by Michael Powell, son of former Secretary of State ColinPowell, who was appointed by Boy Bush or, more to the point, by thosecontrolling him. Powell was replaced by Kevin Martin, former deputy generalcounsel for Bush’s 2000 presidential campaign. The FCC is clearly anorganisation you can trust to protect the public.The people closest to the TETRA technology are the police officers and otheremergency services that use it every day. Already, they are experiencingphysical, mental and emotional consequences, including cancer of the oesophagusin numbers way above the national average. The TETRA handset is located on thechest in the area of the oesophagus and this takes the full impact of theelectromagnetic radiation that the makers and government agree is emitted(Figure 233). People in the street or shopping centre when a police officer usesTETRA are given a serious dose of radiation, so imagine what emergency serviceprofessionals are getting every day. Dr Ian Dring is a scientist who isconvinced of the dangers of TETRA after his brother, Neil, died of oesophaguscancer. Neil was a thirty-eight-year-old police officer in Leicester, my hometown in the English East Midlands, and Dr Dring said there were no signs of thecancer until Neil began to use TETRA. He didn’t smoke, drank very little and wasa super fit triathlete. A colleague of Neil with the Leicester force, againunder forty, died around the same time of exactly the same condition. As DrDring points out, the chances of that, according to the US Cancer Society, wouldbe millions to one. A third Leicester officer, aged twenty-six, was laterdiagnosed with the same condition, the chances of which enter the billions. But,of course, there’s no evidence of a link because O2 and the government say so.In Lancashire, 177 police officers out of 246 who responded to a questionnairesaid they had experienced effects like migraine, nausea, sleeplessness and lackof concentration since the TETRA system had been introduced. Six people,including a chief inspector, suffered dizziness and headaches after a mast wasactivated on the roof of their police station in North Walsham, Norfolk, andtwenty-five people living nearby reported the same symptoms. When a TETRA mastwas switched on at Dursley in Gloucestershire, England, people reported anoutbreak of migraines, sleeplessness, nose bleeds and being ‘shocked awake’ upto fifteen times a night. Eleven children at a school in Littlehampton, Sussex,were sent home with headaches, nosebleeds and dizziness on the day a nearbyTETRA mast was switched on when the local people were not aware it had beenactivated.Image [../Images/00242.jpg]Figure 233: The TETRA handset that puts emergency service personnel at seriousrisk Protestors said they were amazed by the high level of indifference by otherparents and locals and their unwillingness to research what effects this couldhave on their children and themselves. When they handed out information leafletsat the school gate they were soon asked to move, because they were ‘upsettingthe parents’. For many people, being a complete idiot clearly requires no helpfrom TETRA masts. The Police Federation, which represents British policeofficers, was so concerned about the level of reported health effects that itcommissioned a report by research scientist Barrie Trower into the potentialrisks of TETRA. In September 2001, he concluded that: ‘... the government,government scientists and this industry will be responsible for more civiliandeaths in peacetime than all the terrorist organisations put together.’ Troweralso wrote:> Not in dispute is Professor Szmigielski’s study where he spent many years> researching military personnel using pulse modulated microwave radiation up to> and beyond the TETRA range. He compared these results with personnel who were> not exposed. His conclusion (in part) was: a double incidence of all neoplasms> (tumours) with a three fold increase of cancers of the alimentary tract (inc.> Oesophagus and stomach) and a six fold increase of malignancies of the> haemopietic (blood/cells/circulation). I would like the reader to keep in mind> the ‘threefold increase of cancers’. The health effects that he and other scientists predicted are now being seenamong police and public. These include cancer, depression, difficulty inconcentration, illnesses of the brain, headaches, tiredness, infertility and areduction in melatonin, a naturally occurring hormone associated with sleep.This is at least one reason why inability to sleep is often associated withpeople living close to TETRA masts. Melatonin also kills cancer cells during thenight and its depletion increases the risk of cancer taking hold. As I discussedearlier, the pineal gland–melatonin system is vital to interdimentionalconnection and communication, and the Reptilian hybrids drink menstrual blood,eat human flesh full of melatonin and serotonin as a result of terrifyingrituals, and consume the white powder known as ‘monatomic gold’ to stimulatepineal gland function and access other-dimensional abilities like ‘seeing thefuture’. They don’t want the population to have these connections andsuppressing the pineal gland is a key to this. What a coincidence that aconsequence of TETRA (and many such technologies) is a reduction in the levelsof melatonin. The pineal gland has a crucial effect on health, the immunesystem, mental stability and the aging process. The pineal is suppressed, alongwith its production of melatonin, by not only TETRA but all electromagneticfields. With female breast tissue so sensitive to radiation I am not at allsurprised to see mammogram technology that detects breast cancer being linkedwith causing it. I would ask people to consider if they really need thatmicrowave oven which zaps you with radiation and encourages you to eat uttercrap (Figure 234). Then, there is Motor Neurone Disease, a rare condition causedby the breakdown of the nerve cells in the brain that control the muscles. ATETRA transmitter has been located at Drumcarrow Hill in Fife, Scotland, sincethe late 1990s and, although only around 200 people live close by, theconsequences have been disastrous. Or, it could all just be a coincidence forthose connected to government and manufacturers or with a mental age of three.Out of that tiny population there were at least seven cases of cancer and MotorNeurone Disease diagnosed over five years when the average national figure forMotor Neurone Disease is one in between 50,000 and 100,000. The TETRA pulseradiation affects calcium levels, a factor linked to the onset of Motor NeuroneDisease. Dr Gerard Hyland, a biophysicist from the International Institute ofBiophysics, an expert in low level radiation, says of TETRA: ‘We could be seeinga pandemic of brain tumours in ten years’. In an article on the dangers of TETRAhe exposes the smokescreen mantra that the system complies with current safetylimits for radiation ‘protection’:Image [../Images/00243.jpg]Figure 234: What happened to plants after nine days of microwaved water for oneand purified water for the other. The microwaves were out of sync with theplant’s energetic field and the purified water waves were in harmony. The sameapplies to the human body > These limits are, however, purely thermally based – i.e. they simply limit the> intensity of the radiation to ensure that the amount of tissue heating by> absorption of microwave radiation is not in excess of what the body can cope> with. If heating were the only effect of the radiation, existing guidelines> would afford the public adequate protection against the emissions of> Base-stations; unfortunately, however, this is not the case. > For microwaves are waves, and, as such, have properties other than solely> intensity. In particular, the pulsed microwave radiation used in the GSM> [Global System for Mobile Communications or cell phones] and TETRA systems of> telecommunication has a number of rather well defined frequencies that> facilitate its discernment by the alive human organism, and via which the> organism can, in turn, be affected in a purely non-thermal way. This is so> because the alive human organism (and only the alive one) itself supports a> variety of oscillatory electrical biological/ biochemical activities, each> characterised by a specific frequency, some of which happen to be close to> those found in the GSM / TETRA signals; this coincidence makes these> bioactivities potentially vulnerable to interference.

It can also change the nature of DNA andthe consequences for that would be catastrophic. TETRA and mobile phonefrequencies have the potential to short-circuit the body-computer and Dr GerardHyland says that TETRA signals are close to those of human brain frequencies.Once again this is NOT a coincidence. The whole thing is coldly calculated tocause maximum disruption to human function. It is like having interference onyour radio or television – it stops working properly. When this happens to thebody/brain the consequence is mental, emotional and physical problems, becausethe body is an electrochemical computer that is highly sensitive to disruptionby other electrochemical sources. It is the same for those living near or underpower lines, which have been rightly linked with cancers, especially leukaemia.The electromagnetic field of the power lines disrupts the electromagneticcommunication within the brain/body and mental, emotional and physical illnessensues. I have been saying and writing this about power lines since the late1980s, but claims of a connection with physical and mental illness weredismissed and ridiculed by the authorities. However, the evidence is now sostrong that even the National Radiological Protection Board has concluded thatchildren living close to the lines are more likely to get leukaemia and that’sonly one consequence. The electromagnetic fields from the power lines and othertechnology interfere with the electrical system involved in cell replacement andthis causes ‘rogue cells’ to be formed that we call cancer. Every time I seethose cell phone masts on schools I cringe at what is happening to the childrenand teachers inside and they are located on, or close to, many public buildings(Figures 235 to 237). When a friend went to work at County Hall, the councilheadquarters on the Isle of Wight, she was located on the fifth floor, justbelow a group of masts on the roof. She immediately suffered from headaches,behaviour changes and had a blackout. It soon became clear that others had alsonoticed health effects. This is what one worker said in an email:> I have had serious health concerns since starting work in Property Services at> the end of 1999 which were not a problem before that. The most obvious being> cancer in 2001 for which I am still being monitored until 2011.

How an individual interacts with these frequencies will be different, becauseour own frequency make-up will differ. Some will contract cancer, othersdepression or Motor Neurone Disease, and still others might have no discernibleeffects for many years. Thus, you get the response of ‘it’s done nothing to me’... until you get the phone call some way down the road saying: ‘Hey, I thinkyou were right.’ The point is the Reptilian hybrids want humans disrupted inthis way. It makes them easier to control.Manufactured realityDoubters and protestors understandably speak of the TETRA technology not beingtested properly before it was made operational. Oh, but it was. That’s why Isaid earlier that there had been no public research. The health effects areknown at the highest levels and they don’t give a damn. The main point of it allis control of the human mind and emotions. To broadcast at frequencies necessaryto influence mental and emotional activity there will be consequences forhealth, but this is still not the main motivation behind the technology. It isthought control. Biophysicist, Dr Gerald Hyland, writes:> The frequency of the radiation that is used to carry the voice information> [communications] in both GSM and TETRA lies in the microwave band – a> frequency range in which processes as fundamental as cell division can be> interfered with – the somewhat lower carrier frequencies characterising the> TETRA radiation facilitating its deeper penetration into tissue. On the other> hand, the rates at which the microwaves are emitted in distinct groups of> flashes (or pulses) happen to be close to the frequencies of some of the> brain’s own electrical and electrochemical rhythms; accordingly, these can be> amplified, interfered with, and even entrained [switched to the TETRA> frequency] by the radiation. Image [../Images/00247.jpg]Figure 238: TETRA waves being measured TETRA-type technology operates at a pulsing frequency in the range of 17.6Hz.This is close to the wavelengths of brain activity and so it interferes with theelectrical (and therefore every other) system of the brain (Figure 238). Thisaccounts not only for physical and immune system effects, as the communicationfrom brain to body is short-circuited, it also explains mental and emotionalconsequences like depression and inability to concentrate. Dr Hyland makes thisvital point:> Furthermore, the possibility of deliberately provoking epileptic seizures in> certain animals by exposing them to pulsed microwave radiation is consistent> with reports of an increased incidence of seizures in some epileptic children> when exposed to the emissions of GSM Base-stations. The latter finding is not> at all unreasonable, given the known ability of a visible light (such as a> stroboscope) flashing at a rate somewhere between 15-20 times per second to> provoke seizures in the 5 per cent minority of epileptics who are> photosensitive. > For visible light and microwaves are both simply different realisations of> electromagnetic radiation, and the microwave radiation used in GSM and TETRA> similarly ‘flashes’ (pulses) at rates that the brain is able to recognise;> unlike visible light, however, pulsed microwaves are not reliant on the eye> and optic nerve to access the brain, since they can penetrate the skull> directly. All of which brings me to mass mind control. Our thoughts and emotions expressthemselves electrically on one level and they can be implanted electrically. DrJose Delgado, a leading US government mind manipulator, said on theCongressional Record back in 1974:> Man does not have the right to develop his own mind. This kind of liberal> orientation has great appeal. We must electrically control the brain. Some day> armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain. He could have said nations because that is what they are now scheming for.Barrie Trower said in his report for the UK Police Federation:> Pulse radiation from TETRA at 17.6 Hz (waves per second) is known to interfere> with our natural brain’s rhythm. Our brains generate their own waves within> our head. One of these waves, called beta waves, is on a very similar> frequency to the TETRA handsets. What happens is: If you could imagine> yourself jumping on a trampoline and somebody larger and heavier jumps on and> dances at a slightly different speed you will bounce at their pace rather than> yours. When they jump off you will still bounce at their speed. The jumping on> of the person onto the trampoline is known as entrainment and this occurs when> the TETRA is used in close proximity to an officer’s brain.

The implications for this are that the officers’> brain waves would continue to suffer entrainment even after the sets have been> switched off, which would be reinforced every time the sets are switched on> again. Another term for ‘entrainment’ is the sympathetic resonance I described in anearlier chapter with regard to a violin placed among other violins. Its stringswill start vibrating to the note the others are playing because of this‘entrainment’. That’s the idea behind these microwave technologies like TETRAand cell phones. They are designed to disconnect the brain from its naturalrhythm. Barrie Trower writes about the effect on ‘sound judgement in emergencysituations’. Put another way, the ability to think straight, and it is not onlypolice officers who can potentially have their thought processes disrupted. Socan anyone who comes into contact with the TETRA frequencies. Thousands of TETRAmasts are planned to be located throughout Britain alone, never mind the rest ofEurope, their equivalent in North America and elsewhere. Many phone and othermasts are already hidden inside petrol station signs, flag poles,advertisements, churches and located near schools (Figure 239). People have beengoing to church for thousands of years to be mind controlled and now it can bedone with a mast hidden in the spire. In November 2004, a report by the BBCrevealed how Britain already had forty thousand mobile-phone masts and one inten schools had a mast located within 200 metres of the classrooms. A CentralLondon school has twenty-seven masts within this distance, many of them hiddeninside road and petrol station signs. Look at the effect the vibrations of asingle cell phone had on water crystals in the experiments of Japaneseresearcher, Dr Masaru Emoto (Figure 240). Now imagine what a cell phone mastwould do. The entire plan is coordinated to install a network of mobile phone,TETRA and other systems of electromagnetic communications, that operate as oneunit to create an electromagnetic mini-matrix to scramble normal brain and DNAfunction, while dictating mental and emotional responses. It will also havepotential for the mass culling of the population, which is also planned by theReptilian hybrids.Image [../Images/00248.jpg]Figure 239: The many and various places where microwave masts are hidden to keeptheir location secret of the public Image [../Images/00249.jpg]Figure 240: What cell phone frequencies do to water crystals. On the left, isthe crystal was formed from water exposed to words of ‘love and appreciation’,and, on the right, the crystal was formed from water exposed to a cell phone (For more examples see the books, Messages from the Water, volumes one and two,by Masaru Emoto.) Lies in my soupAll this is not happening at this time by accident. There is a vibrationalchange going on that I will explain in some detail later, but, most relevantlyto what we are discussing here, this change is having the effect of wakingpeople up on an ever-greater scale from their induced amnesia. The aim of theelectromagnetic technology in all its many and various forms (plus those wedon’t even know about) is to create an electromagnetic ‘soup’ to suppress theeffect on human awareness of the vibrational change we are experiencing. In May2006, the London Observer reported the growing concern about what it called the‘invisible smog’ that has been created by the ‘electricity that powers ourcivilisation’. It said that new scientific evidence showed that this was ‘givingchildren cancer, causing miscarriages and suicides and making some peopleallergic to modern life’. But of course that must be the case. At the body/brainlevel we are electromagnetic fields and when these are exposed to other fields,especially a sea of them, we are bound to be affected by disharmony – dis-ease –in all its potential forms. The World Heath Organisation says that theelectromagnetic smog could interfere with natural electrical currents that helpto ‘drive the human body’, and calls it ‘one of the most common and fastestgrowing environmental influences’. The Observer article quoted Denis Henshaw,professor of human radiation effects at England’s Bristol University, as sayingthat ‘a huge and substantive body of evidence indicates a range of adversehealth effects’ from this ‘smog’. He estimated that it caused some nine thousandcases of depression and that is understandable when our emotions areelectrochemical phenomena. If you are a fish in the sea you are fundamentallyaffected by the state of the water, and it is the same with us and thevibrational ‘sea’. There are now so many electrical influences, as the Observerarticle said:> Wiring creates electrical fields, one component of the smog, even when nothing> is turned on. And all electrical equipment – from TVs to toasters – give off> another one, magnetic fields. The fields rapidly decrease with distance but> appliances such as hair dryers and electric shavers, used close to the head,> can give high exposures. Electric blankets and clock radios near to beds> produce even higher doses because people are exposed to them for many hours> while sleeping. Radio frequency fields – yet another component – are emitted> by microwave ovens, TV and radio transmitters, mobile phone masts and phones> themselves, also used close to the head. The World Health Organisation has said that the problem will increase astechnology ‘advances’, but it is not advancing, that is the point. How cantechnology that is causing so much physical, mental and emotional dis-ease bedescribed as being an advance? At the highest strata within the conspiracy, theelectromagnetic ‘soup’ is being created to produce an ever-thickening sea offrequency fields to hold the ‘human’ level in disconnection from itsmulti-dimensional self. In other words, to keep us in the five-sense prison of‘physical’ perception where we can be so easily controlled and manipulated. Thevibrational change I will describe in more detail later is threatening thatcontrol and this electromagnetic assault is part of their reaction.Image [../Images/00250.jpg]Figure 241: Chemtrails criss-cross the sky Poisoning the skiesFor me, the chemical clouds sprayed into the atmosphere by military aircraft,and commercial planes contracted by the military, are fundamentally connected tothis ‘soup’ agenda. These clouds have become known as ‘chemtrails’, as opposedto the ‘contrails’ that are naturally produced by aircraft through condensation.Contrails quickly disperse, chemtrails do not, and they are often sprayed byplanes flying in criss-cross patterns across the same area (Figure 241). Authorand researcher, William Thomas, became the most vocal exposer of chemtrails soonafter they began in the United States and Canada in about 1998, before appearingin Europe. Now, they are reported all over the world and Zulu shaman Credo Mutwahas told me of his constant experiences of these high-altitude sprayings inSouth Africa. Disney even added chemtrails to sky scenes in the children’sanimation movie, Cars. Yeah, get them used to seeing the sky like that and theywon’t ask questions. Many people in the United States report that theirlocations are sprayed so often that they no longer have the clear blue skiesthey once enjoyed and you can find detailed articles and background tochemtrails in the coverups research archive at www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com]. The chemtrails have many components. William Thomassays that analysis of the trails has found highly toxic pathogens, among themMycoplasma fermentans incognitus. This was discovered by Dr Garth Nicholson insome 45 per cent of former soldiers suffering from the debilitating illnessknown as Gulf War Syndrome. Symptoms reported in sprayed areas have includedrespiratory and flu-like conditions and sometimes mental confusion anddepression. We should not be surprised at biological warfare against thepopulation when such things have been exposed many times since the 1940s.Unsuspecting communities have often been used as laboratory animals to test germwarfare agents. Remember how the Project for the New American Century reportcalled for … ‘advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specificgenotypes …’ and the fact that they would test these on the population is agiven. By the way, when they say something should be developed, it means italready has been. Chemtrails have been linked by some researchers to theoutbreak of ‘Morgellons disease’, which was first identified in 2001. Thesymptoms include crawling, stinging and biting sensations, skin lesions thatwon’t heal, extreme fatigue, severe mental confusion, short term memory loss,joint pain, a sharp decline in vision, and serious neurological disorders. Itscause is officially ‘a mystery’, but look at how the symptoms mirror many ofthose associated with electromagnetic sensitivity.Image [../Images/00251.jpg]Figure 242: Some of the technology at the HAARP project in Alaska Significantly, in terms of the ‘soup’ I am talking about, analysis has revealedthe presence of aluminium, barium, calcium, magnesium and titanium in the airand rain in areas subjected to chemtrail spraying. One study over three monthscollected rainwater and snow samples from Chapel Hill in North Carolina andsubmitted them for formal ‘double-blind’ laboratory tests. All the substances Ihave listed were found, especially the heavy metal, barium, which a good heatand electricity conductor. Barium sulphate is also an excellent X-ray absorber.A barium alloy is used in sparkplug wire and barium oxide is employed in acoating for the electrodes of fluorescent lamps that allows the release ofelectrons. Aluminium conducts electricity and heat almost as well as copper.Although much more research is needed with open-minded experts in the field(where are they?), I am sure we are going to find that at least one major reasonfor the chemtrails is to add to the electromagnetic ‘soup’ that is gettingever-thicker around the Earth. Specifically, I think it likely that these metalsreleased by the spraying are to create a highly efficient conduit forelectromagnetic waves and broadcasts, so encasing the planet in anelectromagnetic field-prison designed to block ‘unwanted’ wavelengths coming in.At the same time, this ‘soup’ is designed to act as a conductor for thought wavefrequencies broadcast to the population. I suggest that the chemtrail agenda isconnected to HAARP, the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, based inAlaska and run by the US Department of ‘Defense’ through the Air Force and Navy(Figure 242). Other HAARP-like and HAARP-connected operations are beingintroduced in other countries, including Sweden. The target is theelectrically-charged ionosphere surrounding the planet at between forty to sixtymiles above the surface. We won’t know the full significance of what thechemtrail clouds contain until we know how they interact with the signalsbroadcast by HAARP. Behind the cover stories and the bullshit, HAARP is allabout control on multi-levels, including weather control. Prime among them is tofill their artificially-created electromagnetic ‘matrix’, ‘membrane’ or ‘soup’around the Earth with instructions and thought/emotional patterns broadcastingon the brain–DNA wavelengths to turn the human population into little more thancomputer terminals for their instructions. As long-time HAARP researchers, DrNick Begich and Jeane Manning, write:> Put simply, the apparatus for HAARP is a reversal of a radio telescope;> antenna send out signals instead of receiving. HAARP is the test run for a> super-powerful radiowave-beaming technology that lifts areas of the ionosphere> by focusing a beam and heating those areas. Electromagnetic waves then bounce> back onto earth and penetrate everything – living and dead. > HAARP publicity gives the impression that the High-frequency Active Auroral> Research Program is mainly an academic project with the goal of changing the> ionosphere to improve communications for our own good. However, other US> military documents put it more clearly – HAARP aims to learn how to ‘exploit> the ionosphere for Department of Defense purposes’. There you have the real motivation for HAARP and it fits perfectly theelectromagnetic soup I am describing: ‘Electromagnetic waves then bounce backonto earth and penetrate everything – living and dead.’ HAARP, TETRA, mobilephone networks, chemtrails, the Global Positioning Satellite System or GPS, andso much more, are all aspects of the plan and it is unfolding very rapidly. Thisis also the system designed to communicate with the planned human microchipsthat will be connected to the Global Positioning satellites. If you think youlive in zombie land now, give it a few more years unless we bring this insanityto an end. An Internet article on TETRA points out:> Low frequency electromagnetic and microwave radiation were identified in the> 1960s as a potential anti-personnel weapon and the Pentagon has confirmed that> it has developed microwave crowd control weapons. Can a system which is> developed as weaponry be considered safe for the police and public? No, of course not, but I repeat: it’s not meant to be. The electromagnetic‘soup’ is part of a process of creating an alternative communication system to,and between, human minds. It is designed to create the ‘hive mind’ so beloved ofthe Reptilians in which diversity of thought and perception is destroyed. Youwould get your instructions electromagnetically and then act upon them,believing them to be your own thoughts and decisions. As Professor Steven Rosesaid in his Observer article: ‘[Focusing] … an intense magnetic field onspecific brain regions … has been shown to affect thoughts, perceptions andbehaviour’. If they get the frequency right they can even lock humanity into thevery same hive mind that the Reptilians use. We would become them in thought andresponse. To a large extent that is already happening purely throughindoctrination.But, as I keep stressing, this does not have to be if we just stop saying‘baaaaa’ and decide that we truly wish to be free."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 25 The hive mind > Those who manipulate the organized habits and opinions of the masses> constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our> country. > Edward Bernays, assistant to William Paley, founder of CBS It is no surprise to see so many mind-control masts situated at or near schools.One of the themes of my books over the years has been the agenda to mind-controlchildren. This has many facets, including indoctrination through ‘education’,but it goes far deeper than that. They want to own the children, mentally,emotionally and physically.Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, written in the early 1930s, described a societyof total control in which children were brought up in communal nurseries,conditioned from birth to accept what the state told them to do. Like laboratoryrats, children were electro-shocked if they did anything unacceptable to theprogramming. One scene has babies crawling towards pictures of flowers and birdsonly to be shocked because the State didn’t want them to like nature. A form ofthis is going on right across society today as people are punished throughvarious means for not acting in ways acceptable to the State, and rewarded whenthey do as demanded. One form of ‘electro-shock’ is to attack and ridiculepeople who challenge conventional ‘thinking’. Huxley was George Orwell’s Frenchteacher at Eton for a short time and if you fuse their two books, 1984 and BraveNew World, you will get very close to the truth of what is happening today. Thechildren in Brave New World are brainwashed even when they sleep as subliminalmessages turn them into insatiable consumers to drive the engine of industrialproduction – as indeed they are today. At the heart of this child-control was toremove children from the influence of their parents. Huxley describes how the‘Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning’ explains the origin of the term‘parent’ to his students:> In brief, parents were the father and mother … These are unpleasant facts, I> know it. But then most historical facts are unpleasant … In those days …> children were brought up by their parents and not in State Conditioning> Centres. Still, that was just a novel, a fantasy, the equivalent of a sci-fi movie,right? If only. The very world described by Huxley is installed all around us,as piece by piece the tapestry of control is constructed. Journalist Bel Mooney,writing in the UK Daily Mail, put it well when she said:> Make no mistake, totalitarianism creeps up on you. One minute you think you> live in a free society and then you turn your back and, hey presto, another> little rule, a fresh directive, a sneaky law, an insidious diktat – all of> them putting up prison bars through which we have to view the world. This is the Totalitarian Tiptoe. What prompted Bel Mooney into print on this wasa highly significant piece in the puzzle being proposed by the Britishgovernment and increasingly seen elsewhere. It is the plan by the UK Departmentof Education to impose rules on the teaching of ‘communication, language andliteracy’ to toddlers. No, I’m not making this up. It comes with theOrwellian/Huxleyan title of ‘The Early Years Foundation Stage’, and includesteaching these kids, barely-out-of-nappies, ‘personal and social development’and ‘knowledge and understanding of the world’. To quote Mooney: ‘The systemwill have to be used by all nurseries and childminders, and will cover a child’sdevelopment from birth, including structured maths and language training atthree’. Beverley Hughes, the bewildered ‘Children’s Minister’, said it was a‘radical Bill’ that ‘will address the needs of parents in the modern world withthe offer of childcare’. They were ‘bringing childcare into the mainstream ofservices parents can expect to be available as part of the modern welfarestate’. Ms. Hughes is not the brightest candle in the box and she probably, likemost of Blair’s poodles and puppets, had no idea of the significance of whatthose behind the scenes were using her to introduce. When you put her wordsthrough an Orwellian Translation Unit, you get this: ‘We want control of yourchild’s mind’. As Pink Floyd so memorably sang about ‘education’: ‘All in all,it’s just another brick in the wall’. Parents are not perfect and they makemistakes either because they are trying to do what they wrongly think is best orthey just couldn’t care less. The crucial word here is diversity. When childrendevelop with parental influence it creates a much greater diversity ofupbringing – and diversity is like garlic to a vampire to those with our worldin their sights. Diversity = different, and they don’t do different. You can’tcontrol the different and diverse on anything like the scale of the uniform anduniversal. They want to centralise everything, in this case the indoctrinationof children, and submerge diversity under a tidal wave of uniformity. He whothinks the same can be controlled the same. They want one blueprint, one mind,one reality, so that humans operate with the same ‘hive mind’ of the Reptilians.Bel Mooney was right when she wrote:> Is the real goal of this control-freakery to raise a new generation of hapless> production line children who will not have enough independence of mind to say> boo to a goose, still less to challenge those in authority? Too right it is.The left-brain prisonA major aspect of this targeting of toddlers is to turn children into what Icall ‘left brain prisoners’. The brain has two hemispheres connected by a‘bridge’ called the corpus callosum. The left side of the brain involves our‘this world’ reality of language, what passes for ‘logic’, and the ‘physical’world perspective; the right side is the creative, the artistic, the ‘out there’connection to levels of consciousness beyond this five-sense reality. In ourbalanced ‘whole brain’ state, the two sides are in harmony, neither dominatingthe other, with the bridge passing information and insight between the two. Whatthe system has done, in full awareness at Illuminati level, is to structuresociety, ‘education’, chemicals in food and drink, etc., to close down vasttracts of the corpus callosum to suppress the scale of communication between thehemispheres. They then program the population, especially children, to see lifeoverwhelmingly through the left brain. This is one major reason why ‘science’has not understood the nature of life and reality. It is populated byleft-brainers who can’t get ‘out there’ to perceive beyond ‘physical’ reality.Therefore, they are obsessed with, and blinkered by, the realm of ‘matter’. Soit is with doctors, teachers, politicians and other pillars of the system. Theygo through the ‘education’ machine and take their places in positions of powerand influence with their right brain under lock and key. Now, and this is thepoint with regard to the ‘education’ of children, the earlier this processstarts the more effective and life-long it is going to be. Hence, ‘The EarlyYears Foundation Stage’ and its teaching of ‘communication, language andliteracy’ to toddlers, together with ‘knowledge and understanding of the world’.The ‘play’ years of toddlers are vital to their balanced development. Play‘ad-libs’ and awakens their right brain, the creative, the imaginative, the ‘outthere’ connections. The right brain ad-libs and flows with the moment, while theleft brain wants rigid structure. What do the Reptilian hybrids want for theglobal population? – rigid structure. The idea, way above the heads of peoplelike ‘Children’s Minister’ Beverley Hughes and the other clones-in-government,is to bombard toddlers at the earliest possible time with left-brain informationto stimulate that and close down the influence of the right. This willdisconnect them from multi-dimensional awareness and make them prisoners of the‘physical reality’ that the Illuminati seek to control. The way art, music andother forms of right-brain creativity are being downgraded in schools andcolleges is part of this, too, and so is the indoctrination through television(Figure 243).Image [../Images/00252.jpg]Figure 243: Children watch the resident hypnotist I have been trying to get across to people for so long that such changes are notdone ad hoc on the whim of the government of the time. That’s just what theywant you to believe. You cannot look at what is happening without also includingthe creation of universal ‘education’ in the first place; the brain-changingchemicals in soft drinks and food, and the financial pressures on mothers towork fulltime and hand over the development of their children to outsiders andthe State. All these facets, and more, are part of a long-organised plan to takeover our children in both mind and body. This is where people like Bel Mooneyand the ‘left’ lose the plot. She says these plans for our children were part ofTony Blair’s ‘New Labour ideology’. Well, yes they are on one level, but if itwasn’t Blair and his party doing it then it would be someone else, because thisis where the conspiracy has planned all along to take us. What is happening inBritain is happening in the United States and country after country is beingpicked off and ticked off in the same way. Are Blair and his ‘New Labourideology’ responsible for all that, too? It is a global plan by a global force.It’s so obvious I could scream. The introduction of state-controlled educationwas not, at the highest level, to educate at all. The last thing a dictatorwants is a truly educated and intelligent population. It was, and is, the meansto universally indoctrinate a life-long sense of reality. One protestor againstState education in America said as long ago as 1926: ‘If you give thebureaucrats the children, you might as well give them everything else as well’.He was right on the button and an Internet writer put it like this:> The answer to our education holocaust is not smaller classes, more computers,> more after-school programmes or ‘No Child Left Behind’ by the State’s> mandatory child enslavement. The only answer is the denouncement of government> education as evil, and its subsequent elimination. The education that will follow the fall of the Illuminati state will see allchildren as unique expressions of the Infinite One. It will help them toconnect, or hold connection, with their multi-dimensional self, always focusingon the unique at the expense of the uniform. It will be a world in which societyresponds to people, not the other way round. But sitting on the arse is notgoing to make it happen. Arse sitting is like arse licking – it always handspower to the few.> ‘Hey, dad, hey mom, when they were turning children into robots and building> the system that controls my life, what were you doing?’ > ‘We were sitting on our arses, dear.’ > ‘Gee, thanks, mom, thanks, dad … I’ll see you next year then when I get leave> from the State Conditioning Centre – if I still recognise you.’ > ‘Okay dear, be good – love you.’ War on the youngI feel for young people today. They are bombarded from every angle withprogramming, indoctrination and chemical suppression of brain activity throughadditives in their food and drink – plus all the electromagnetic influences,like cell phones. The idea is to slam down the lid on their potential andperception, so they slip off the production line as mindless adults. We areseeing the gathering process of testing how much young people have absorbed thisprogramming and how many can still see the truth, despite the intellectual andspiritual blindfolds they are pressured to wear. I saw an account from a15-year-old in Britain about her experience of this undercover mind-search. Sheposted her account on the Internet after she had taken a general studies exam.She thought she would be tested on the content of her school work, which she hadbeen revising for some six months, but no. The questions bore no connection towhat she had been learning. Instead, she was asked about her knowledge of‘conspiracy theories’ with the emphasis on 9/11. She wrote:> I will lay down the outline of the main question on the paper, bearing in mind> this is not word for word as I could not write down the question and take it> away, and I failed to remember the question exactly: ‘Using Source 1 and your> own knowledge, discuss the possibility of governments misleading citizens into> believing facts which are not entirely true, and what the purpose of this> would be’. > Source 1 happens to be a short excerpt from someone in America whose name I> fail to remember, talking about the Trade Center attacks, quoting missiles.> And obviously since I’ve been watching … videos … I know that with the> exception of this one quote, there has been no other mention of missiles being> involved in the attacks, so this strikes me immediately. There were three other questions relating to how far she would trust thegovernment and Prime Minister Tony Blair, and how far she would trust otherleaders such as Bush. She sat the exam on her own ‘in a more than normallysecure room’ with the head of the exam board ‘at my toes’ the whole hour and aquarter. Afterwards, she told a friend at the college who was supposed to takethe same general studies exam that the girl thought she was going to take. Thefriend said he had taken the usual exam that was nothing like the one she hadsat. A few minutes later, the girl said, she was taken aside by the head of theexam board and told that she had been selected for a test that most people wouldnot know existed. He asked if she had spoken to anyone about what happened. Shesaid no and he told her to keep it to herself, to tell her friends she took thesame exam as them, and the exam board would ‘look kindly on my cooperation’. Sheassumed this meant that if she kept her mouth shut she would get a good grade.But, in her words: ‘I’d much rather piss on his shoes and tell you this wholething’. Good on you, girl, and what a coincidence that a student who clearly hasa mind of her own should be the one ‘selected’ to take this test. I have writtenmuch about the Thought Police who seek to sift the thinkers from the sheep andit is clear that this is now starting at a very early age. Some Americanchildren are given ‘patriotism tests’, which, as with the UK example, havenothing to do with the curriculum they have been studying. A girl in the tenthgrade was given a questionnaire out of the blue in her English class in whichshe had to agree or disagree with these statements:> It is never right to kill another person; Political leaders usually act in the> best interest of their countries; If a political leader has done something> wrong, it is all right to get rid of him by whatever means necessary; Power> corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely; In certain situations it> maybe justified for a political leader to bend or break the law for the good> of the country; People should never compromise their ideals or beliefs; ‘My> country right or wrong’ is not just a slogan, it is every citizen’s patriotic> duty; No cause, political or otherwise, is worth dying for; Cowards die many> times before their deaths, the valiant taste death, but once; The evil that> men do lives after them, the good is [often buried] with their bones. We have seen similar tests come to light in the military, including the questionof would they serve a United Nations leadership and would they shoot Americancitizens. This is all part of the process of gathering information about thethoughts and attitudes of people to see (a) how far the indoctrination has takenhold, and (b) how effective the conspiracy-exposure movement has been in gettingpeople, especially the young, to see through the global manipulation. InOrwell’s book, 1984, it wasn’t the masses that the Big Brother State wastargeting because they already had them sorted. The majority were soindoctrinated that they were not considered worth keeping under the closestsurveillance. They never challenged State imposition, so there was no point. Itwas the dissidents that were really targeted and so it is today. Find out who isa thinker and then watch them like a hawk. The ‘tests’ for students who thinkout of the box, and the Internet profiling of people based on the websites theychoose to read, are all involved in this process. The authorities are nowdemanding that search engine companies keep and release as instructed the webaddresses on their databases, plus records of all searches. The Bush cabal saidit needed the information to prepare its effort to revive the 1998 Child OnlineProtection Act, which was blocked the first time by the Supreme Court. The ideathat the Bush crowd want to protect children is utterly laughable. If you wantto see websites featuring paedophiles, child killers, Satanists and massmurderers who prey on children go no further than these: www.firstgov.gov[http://www.firstgov.gov] and www.whitehouse.gov [http://www.whitehouse.gov].The demand for search data has nothing to do with protecting children. It isabout tracking and profiling potential dissidents.Nailing the ‘norms’We are further conditioned to see what we are told to see by the very ‘norms’ ofsociety I have been emphasising in book after book. Hypnosis has many facets. Itdoes not have to stand on a stage or hold a swinging pocket watch. Hypnosis ofthe type I am talking about is the programming of the conscious and subconsciousmind to believe a falsehood to such an extent that this is what it ‘sees’. Thehypnotist is implanting a false reality into your mind. Those ten wordsencapsulate the real motive behind the ‘education’ system, official ‘science’,the media, government pronouncements and all the other sources of official‘information’ with which the human brain and mind is deluged every day – ‘thehypnotist is implanting a false reality into your mind’. I have exposed thisprocess in detail in other books and this is what these institutions are:hypnotists. This is especially true of ‘education’ and the media, and, mostparticularly, television. These constant influences program our sense of‘reason’ to such an extent that we believe the illusion and the lies to be real.As I mentioned earlier, Don Juan, the shaman source of author Carlos Castaneda,is quoted as saying:> We are perceivers. We are awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity.> We are boundless … We, or rather our reason, forget [this] and thus we entrap> the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in> our lifetime. From the moment we become five-sense conscious, the programming of our realitybegins. In fact, it begins in the womb through the mother. We already start witha ‘body’ that carries its inherited reality programming through the DNA, andthis often includes genetic subservience to authority and a sense of ‘I am smalland insignificant’. The minds of most people are prisoners of their body’sgenetic programming and responses. The body-computer program is in control oftheir actions and reactions, not the incarnate consciousness. In such people, aninherited genetic trait like alcoholism will be repeated in their ownexperience. Those with consciousness more powerful than the programming will beable to override it and avoid the repetition. The Reptilian conspiracy is aimedat suppressing consciousness so we are controlled by the programming, bothinherited and downloaded during our ‘physical’ lives. Most people expend so muchenergy coping with the inherited responses, reactions, desires and demands oftheir body-computer that they have little left to look up and see beyond theillusion. In childhood, we are subjected to the programming of our parents whoinstil their own conditioned reality upon us. From the age of four or five, thisis compounded massively by school and ‘education’, which is often little morethan legalised child abuse. The abuse, that is, of the child’s mind and sense ofreality. What does the ‘education’ system actually do? It indoctrinates a falsereality day after day throughout the most critical period of a child’sdevelopment by (a) pounding out the official version of science, history,possibility and impossibility, and all the rest; and (b) by insisting that onlyby repeating this in exams will you progress within the Illuminati system thatcontrols ‘education’.For many, this indoctrination at school is followed by college or university‘education’ in which the same process is repeated at a higher level. Educationis not involved in developing self-awareness; it merely prepares young people todo the jobs that will serve the system. As Albert Einstein put it: ‘The onlything that interferes with my learning is my education’. Real ‘education’ isactually unlearning the indoctrination of official ‘education’. Constantlyunderpinning these false realities throughout our lives is the conditioning ofthe same ‘norms’ and ‘truths’ by the media, most powerfully via the residenthypnotist in the corner of the room – the television. Add to this the fact thatalmost everyone around you will have been through the same programming, andaccept the same realities, plus the peer pressure throughout your life toconform to the norms even if you don’t want to. This produces a network ofinterconnected imposition of reality that causes all but a few to submit to thiscollective mind-control. When they accept this hypnotic state, and most do froma very early age, their brains and minds are programmed to ‘see’ the reality ithas been programmed to believe in. It ‘sees’ what it is indoctrinated to see,and edits out anything that doesn’t fit, as I described in the first twochapters. This ‘seeing what they believe’ confirms to people most powerfully ofall that what they believe is true. The bigger the lie and the more it isrepeated, the more will believe it. This process of indoctrinating reality hasconvinced six billion people that ‘seeing is believing’ and that the ‘world’‘around’ them is ‘real’. They can see, hear, touch, smell and taste it – so itmust be.Force whisperingThe most important target for the mass reality manipulators is the subconsciouswhere instructions and perceptions can be implanted beyond the awareness of theconscious mind. This is what a hypnotist is doing and the system, especiallytelevision, is the hypnotist for the global population. How appropriate that wecall television output television programmes. Even the brainwave state we gointo while watching TV is the same as that of a hypnotic trace. So much is beingimplanted that we are not aware of that later filters into the conscious mind asthought, perceptions and decisions that we think are our own. It is thetargeting of the subconscious that is behind the bombardment of subliminalmessages coming at us from all angles and their aim is to manipulate behaviour.This is done mostly through human ‘drives’ like survival (hunger, thirst, dangerof all kinds) and sex, greed, social acceptance, security and territoriality.All of these ‘drives’ are phenomena of the R-complex or reptilian brain, whichalso works with images more than words. Subliminal means ‘below threshold’because the messages are communicated at a level that the conscious mind doesn’tregister, but the subconscious does. The subconscious sees all while theconscious notes only a fraction of what passes through the eyes – and evenchanges much of that. Subliminal advertising was exposed in the 1950s when sometelevision and movie theatre ads were found to be transmitting split-secondimages that the conscious mind couldn’t see to stimulate a desire for a product.This included a subliminal ‘I’m thirsty’ during drinks commercials. Theknowledge of subliminal programming goes back to ancient times with scholarslike Plato and Aristotle mentioning the technique, and more than five hundredscientific papers have been published confirming the effectiveness ofsubliminals. Producers of movies like The Exorcist and The Texas ChainsawMassacre publicly admitted that they contained violent and frighteningsubliminals. If you want to see an example of how subliminal messages candictate behaviour go to the mind control archive at www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com] and watch the item headlined: ‘Video Proof thatSubliminal Suggestion Works’.Image [../Images/00253.jpg]Figure 244: There’s massive subliminal message in this picture. Can you see it? The use of subliminals is supposed to be illegal in some countries and theIlluminati-controlled Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) in theUnited States says that subliminals are inherently deceptive. It says the viewerdoes not perceive them at a normal level of awareness and is given no choicewhether to accept or reject the message. So why is nothing done about thesubliminals that abound in advertising, let alone in political manipulation? TheFederal Communications Commission (FCC) has no regulation barring subliminaladvertising, but generally considers it deceptive, it says. If you put‘subliminal’ or ‘subliminal advertising’ into web search you’ll see manyexamples and the picture on this page carries a very clear subliminal messageonce it is pointed out (Figure 244). Readers of Tales from the Time Loop andthose who have seen my public talks will know what it is. I am repeating it herefor new readers because it provides an excellent example of how subliminalmanipulation works. Apparently, about five per cent see the subliminal messageat first sight and the rest are amazed when it is made clear to them. If youhaven’t seen it, look at the white areas and not the plants. Your eyes go to theplants, but it is most often in the background that subliminals are posted. Weconsciously see the apparent focus of the ad while the background passes us by.Look at the lower level of the two plants on the left and you will see that theycombine to make the letter S in the white background. Move your eyes right andyou’ll see an E and an X. It is so clear once it is pointed out because thesubliminal is no longer ‘below threshold’ – your conscious mind is aware of it.Every time you look at the picture now you will see the subliminal clearer thanthe plants. This is why it is so important to communicate the information inbooks like this one as widely as possible. So much of the conspiracy succeedsonly so long as it operates ‘below threshold’, and once people understand eventhe basics of the game we become so much harder to manipulate. Also, the veryawareness that we are being bombarded by subliminals advances their effect bycreating an energetic barrier that filters them out.Image [../Images/00254.jpg]Figure 245: What was found when a pro-Bush, anti-Gore commercial was slowed down I have often said that the Illuminati manipulate the people by manipulating thebasic image they have of something, rather than the detail. They know thatpeople don’t retain detail from the television, or even newspapers. They go awaywith a feeling, an image, about a person or event. Tell the people somethingover and over and at the level of the image – the feeling – they willoverwhelmingly accept this to be a true picture of events even though there isno detail to back it up. The authorities keep repeating the same mantra, like‘weapons of mass destruction’, ‘al-Qaeda was responsible’, and ‘it was BinLaden’. This is simple hypnosis. All the subliminal techniques used byadvertisers to sell products are used by the government spinners who are, afterall, just selling a president, prime minister or policy in the same way thatCoca-Cola sells canned drinks. One of the more crass and incompetent attempts atsubliminal manipulation came in the Bush presidential campaign in 2000 when apolitical ad placed by the Republican National Committee flashed the word ‘RATS’over an Al Gore prescription drug proposal (Figure 245). It was left up too longin the same way that a subliminal flash of former French President FrançoisMitterrand was spotted in the opening titles of a French news programme when hewas seeking election. The Bush ‘RATS’ tape only had to be slowed down slightlyto be clearly visible. Let no one kid themselves that subliminal messages (or‘subliminable’ as George Bush called them) are not pouring from politicaladvertisements. Note how the background behind Bush is always full of picturesof his family when he is announcing the certain death of families in countrieshis masters want to conquer. It is all aimed at the subconscious. OperationIraqi Freedom, the title the Pentagon spinners gave to their human slaughter inIraq, was devised for the same reason. The names for these military invasionsare designed solely to depict what the spinners want the public to believe thewar is all about. See Tales from the Time Loop for more detailed informationabout subliminal trickery and more illustrated examples.‘We’re revolting!’ I agree …You can see mass mind control and the hive mind at work in the news every day asthe masses are manipulated to produce the desired reaction to people and events.It is little more than downloading the data, pressing ‘Enter’ and activating thesoftware. Take fifty kittens and fifty balls of wool. Put them all in a smallroom for a week and then come back and unravel the mess. That is the challengewe face today with mind-game events like the protests in 2006 over the cartoondepiction of the Prophet Mohammed as a terrorist. There was a protest in Londonwith banners calling for the cartoonist and publishers to be beheaded and oneprotestor – a convicted drug dealer called Omar Khayam – was dressed as asuicide bomber. This guy later publicly and ‘wholeheartedly’ apologised for his‘insensitive behaviour’ to the victims and families of the London bombings inJuly 2005, which were blamed on Muslim suicide bombers. Already the wool is in aterrible tangle and most of it is covering the eyes. Firstly, there is themonumental doublethink necessary to believe that a cartoonist who depicted theIslamic religion as violent should attract protests against that depiction whichcall for him and his publishers to be executed. Second, they oppose the freedomthat allows the cartoonist to draw such a cartoon, yet claim the right to theirfreedom to call for him and others to be murdered. Ugh? Thirdly, the fake‘suicide bomber’ apologised to the victims of the London ‘suicide bombings’ whenthe attacks were orchestrated by the same non-Muslim force behind 9/11. Some ofthe banners in the protests in London and around the world said ‘remember 9/11’as a warning to those who attack Islam when Islamic terrorists were not thecause of those attacks. It was another inside job engineered by those who wantedan excuse for massive surveillance and control and a war on Islam. TheIlluminati must be in hysterics. Cue kittens …Image [../Images/00255.jpg]Figure 246: Orchestrated mind-control The depiction in the cartoon of Mohammed as a terrorist with a bomb on his headwas an outrageous misrepresentation and I understand the dismay in the Islamicworld. The majority of Muslims are peaceful people. I have been to many Islamiccountries, including Saudi Arabia, and found most Muslims to be some of thenicest, kindest people I have met anywhere. The stereotype of Muslim meansterrorist and Islam means terrorism is a disgraceful and calculated distortionof the truth. It is also the case that the reaction of a small minority ofMuslims to the cartoon with their calls for bans and beheading had the real feelof a set-up job (Figure 246). Many people are so easy to manipulate into extremeor violent protest. What these uninformed silly sods don’t realise (though theagent provocateurs among them do) is that their actions further confirm in thepublic mind what the Illuminati want them to believe and fear about the Islamicpeoples they are now targeting with a vengeance. In short, these mindlessprotestors are walking blindfold into the trap that has been set for them.Peaceful Muslims at home with their children do not attract television cameras –small groups of violent or banner-toting idiots do. And they have. Day after dayat the height of the cartoon controversy we saw them across the global mediaamid the burning flags, burning embassies and waving banners calling for violentreprisals. The Reptilian hybrids loved it – oh what publicity for theirhate-the-Muslims-they’re-all-terrorists campaign.Merete Eldrup, managing director of the Danish newspaper that published thecartoons, is the wife of regular Bilderberg Group attendee, Anders Eldrup. TheDanish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is another Bilderberger. The manwho commissioned cartoonists to produce the offending images, and then publishedthem in Denmark’s leading morning paper, is the ‘cultural editor’, FlemmingRose. He said he was doing it in support of free speech, but this is the sameman who refuses to challenge the bans on questioning any aspect of the Holocaustor take up the disgraceful cases of historians and writers jailed in Europe forchallenging official history. The International Herald Tribune noted that Rose,the ‘liberal’ supporter of free speech, refused to criticise Zionist leaders andtheir crimes. Rose told the paper that he would not publish a cartoon ofIsrael’s then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, strangling a Palestinian baby, sincethat could be construed as ‘racist’. Oh, but anything goes with anyone else itseems. Rose could easily be construed as a hypocrite – and should be. Once againwe find a Neocon connection. According to the American Free Press:> Rose travelled to Philadelphia in October 2004 to visit Daniel Pipes, the> Neo-Con ideologue who says the only path to Middle East peace will come> through a total Israeli military victory. Rose then penned a positive article> about Pipes, who compares ‘militant Islam’ with fascism and communism. In> April 2003, President George W. Bush nominated the rabid anti-Muslim Pipes to> the board of the United States Institute of Peace, a congressionally sponsored> think tank dedicated to ‘the peaceful resolution of international conflicts’. The cartoon controversy was a well-orchestrated mind-control sting operation andthe relative handful of Muslims with their burnings and threats of violencewalked and squawked right in. An extreme mentality will manifest anywhere. Itmay don a different uniform, but the mentality is just the same. This mentalityborn into a Muslim community will be the Islamic extremist imposing his will oneveryone else according to the strict – often contradictory – demands of theKoranic texts. The same mentality born in Tel Aviv would be a Jewish extremistimposing his will on everyone else according to the strict – often contradictory– demands of the Judaic texts. The same mentality born in Louisiana would be aChristian extremist imposing his will on everyone else according to the strict –often contradictory – demands of the biblical texts. Same face, different mask,same program, different obsession. I saw a television ‘debate’ which featured anobnoxious, arrogant, self-styled ‘Muslim leader’ who shouted down every otherguest who had a different view. One of them said that he was no different toNick Griffin, the leader of the far-right British National Party, which wantspeople like the big-mouth Muslim to be jailed or thrown out of the country. Onthe surface they seem to be on polarised ‘sides’, but they are of the samementality, one in a robe, the other in a suit. Same people, different uniform.The Reptilian hybrids are very skilled and experienced in playing off differentexpressions of this extreme mentality against each other to create the conflict,fear and thus the essential divide and rule. The protestors involved in violenceor threats of violence are doing precisely what they have been manipulated to do– portray Islam as the religion of violence, fear, dictatorship and darkness.Yet it doesn’t have to be like that. We have a choice when faced with unfairportrayals of ourselves and our beliefs. We can choose to be offended or we canchoose not to be. Yes, it’s that simple. Had there been peaceful, thoughtful,intelligent protests about the biased depiction of Islam in that cartoon, therewould have been great sympathy from many people and the chance to make the pointthat Islam is demonised by the acts of the very few at the expense of themajority who are peaceful. Instead, because the mob has chosen to be offended,or manipulated to be, the behaviour we saw hardened the image that people haveof Islam and its advocates. Hardly great thinking is it? The villain this timewas a cartoonist and Muslims could have chosen to be offended, kidnap people,threaten violence, and torch flags and buildings, or they could have said ‘whata prat’ and gone about their lives. They could have said the cartoon was anoutrageous misrepresentation of their religion, but they agree with freedom ofexpression and their faith is far too strong to be undermined by such nonsense.What a different reaction this would have gleaned from the non-Muslimpopulation.Personally, I am getting just a little sick of people being ‘offended’ andseeking to deny everyone the right to express any view they choose to beoffended by. You’re offended? I think I see a way out of this: choose not to be.There you go, sorted. I am not offended by how Muslims or Christians or Jews seethe world because, much as I fundamentally disagree with their religiousbeliefs, they have every right to express them. My challenge only comes whenthey try to impose their beliefs on others or suppress beliefs they don’t like.Freedom of expression, however, would appear to be a one-way liberty. I saw atelevision discussion in which a Christian, who campaigned vociferously to ban aBBC programme mocking his religion, said that it was fine to publish thatMohammed cartoon. Hypocrite. If a religion or other belief system is not strongenough to survive and prosper without imposition or the suppression of otherviews then its advocates don’t seem too confident in its ability to influencepeople through the power of its message. I am not just talking Islam here, butall religion and beliefs. If anyone is offended by what I’ve said, I’m sorrythat I don’t have a flag for you to burn – I don’t believe in nationalismeither. I do have a Leicester City Football Club woolly hat if that’s any goodto you. I’ve thought about burning it myself, to be honest, the way they’veplayed recently. You can laugh at the mocking and spoofing of religion or youcan think it’s really silly. That’s not the point here. It is that the peopleinvolved have a right to mock and question and you have a right to see and hearthem – if you choose to. If the day comes when you don’t have that right (andit’s close), freedom will be history for all of us, no matter what your faith.When will the mist clear long enough for all to see that the freedom to promoteChristianity is the freedom to promote Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and all therest? The freedom to promote what one supports is only a freedom if others havethe freedom to mock, question, even misrepresent. All of these freedoms are thesame freedom and without any of them the only ‘freedom’ left is the freedom toagree and conform.Religion is simply mind-control – manipulating people to believe what themanipulators want them to believe. How can it not be when you see the extremesto which the belief must be worshipped and obeyed? I saw a televisiondocumentary series in which one Islamic fanatic measured everything she didevery day against whether ‘the Prophet’ had done it. In 2002, fifteenschoolgirls died in a blazing building in Mecca after the Saudi Arabia‘religious police’ blocked their escape when they weren’t wearing the correctfemale Islamic dress. One witness said he saw three policemen beating younggirls to prevent them from leaving the school because they were not wearing theabaya [black clothing that covers the whole body]’. The religious police arewidely feared in Saudi Arabia, as they roam the streets enforcing dress codesand sex segregation, and ensuring prayers are performed on time. Those whorefuse to obey their orders are often beaten and sometimes jailed. These guysare nothing less than mind-controlled zombies and you find mind-controlledextremists in all religions because they are all expressions of the same basicprogram. When you add the technological potential for mind and emotionalmanipulation, never in known human history has the population been under so muchpressure to believe what it is told to believe. The Orwellian ‘StrategicCommunication Laboratories’ that I featured in the previous chapter tells itsclients:> We live in a world of communication, where perception is very often the> reality. Those individuals that control the perceptions are the ones that> control virtually everything. Most modern conflicts are based on misaligned> perceptions, ideologies, opinions about religion, etc. If a government does> not have the tools to manage the perceptions which effect security, defence,> finance, tourism, health and foreign relations, then it may well find itself> at the mercy of those that do. But this agenda to control can operate only at the computer level of reality.Infinite Awareness is far more powerful than any manipulation, TETRA mast, HAARPproject or propaganda, and that’s why the whole of society is structured to holdus in the computer level of perception – the five-senses. When we open our mindsand our hearts to the infinite genius that we are, the programming goes in oneear and out the other because Infinite Awareness has no ‘ears’, only knowing.That’s our way out of all this – that’s the way home."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 26 Access codes > My doctor gave me six months to live, but when I couldn’t pay the bill he gave> me six months more. > Walter Matthau The Reptilian hybrids are at war with the human body and psyche because they areterrified that enough people will awaken from their trance state and see theworld for what it is: a global prison. Even more frightening to their reptilianbrain is that we will realise who the prison warders are.It is testament to human potential that the manipulators have to work so hard tomaintain the collective amnesia. They have to use mind control, subliminalmessages, electromagnetic pollution, food and drink additives, medical drugs andvaccines. They also have to lie by the minute through the media and ‘education’,and suppress the information that would expose the plot and allow ‘humans’ toknow who and where they really are. Our natural state is one ofmultidimensional, infinite consciousness. To control us, the Reptilians have hadto manipulate the people into an unnatural state of disconnection, a sense ofdivision and separateness, that perceives the world only through the tiny lensof the five senses. We have seen throughout the book the many ways that this isdone, and another is by poisoning mind and body through what we eat, drink andget from the doctor.The body is a biological computer and there are many access codes – vibrational,electrical and chemical. They’re all vibrational fields in the end, but theytake different forms. Everything is an expression of everything else, so achemical will affect the body vibrationally and a vibrational/electrical fieldcan affect the body’s chemical balance. This means that when the body isdestabilised chemically it disrupts the electrical systems which, in thisreality, affect thought and emotion. That’s a given when you see how people areconstantly imbalanced mentally and emotionally by medical and other drugs. Igave the example early in the book of the woman who suffered from untreatableclinical depression for forty years until she realised it was caused by mercuryfillings in her teeth. The body itself has the ability to think and expressemotion and our Infinite Awareness communicates with this reality through thebody’s electrical systems. If the body is chemically imbalanced the electricalcommunication short-circuits with the endless consequences that we see inmedical and psychiatric hospitals. The conspiracy wants to access ourbody-computers in every way possible to undermine our ability to think straight,have balanced emotions and bring higher levels of perception through thecomputer into this five-sense ‘world’. This is what the Reptilian hybrids aredoing through their food and drink corporations and their pharmaceutical cartel.There was a time, not that long ago really, when food was mostly grown locallyfor the community on land uncontaminated by the poisons and potions of ‘modern’farming. The food would contain nutrients from the soil. They hadn’t yet beenall but eliminated by the sickness and stupidity of the intensive farming system– developed and controlled by the Reptilian hybrid corporations like Monsanto.The produce would mostly be sold close to where it was grown, certainly nothinglike as far away as it is today, and this meant there was no need for chemicalpreservatives or to have massive trucks transporting it long distances to asupermarket. Especially from the late 1940s, what we eat and drink became aprime target for the Illuminati networks and now food production is run theirway for their benefit. The Problem-Reaction-Solution that was World War Two ledto such a centralisation of power that they could push on to the next stage ofglobal control. This included destabilising the population mentally, emotionallyand physically through what is consumed, absorbed or injected. A common theme inchemical food and drink additives, the poisons used in the crop growing andanimal production processes, medical drugs and vaccines is their effect ongenetics and brain activity. This is what you would expect when suppressing bodyand brain function is what this is all about. They hide this agenda byannouncing false causes for diseases and complaints that their poisons arereally responsible for. An example is suntan lotion. We are told that skincancer is caused by too much exposure to the Sun when the true cause is thechemicals in sunblock.One poison, or two?The Reptilian hybrids are clever, but stupid. Another way of putting it isclever, but not wise. When it comes to wisdom they’re real dumb, because if theyweren’t so wisdom-deficient they wouldn’t be doing what they are. Clevernesswithout wisdom is the most destructive force on earth and that’s why theReptilian hybrids are so destructive. However, they are very clever in theintellectual sense and this can be seen in how they play with the human psycheto get what they want. For instance, if they wish to create a market for a sugarsubstitute that undermines brain activity they arrange for widespread attacks onthe dangers of sugar and obesity. They don’t mention that they control the sugarcorporations and that people are getting fatter and fatter by consuming theirchemical food, which includes the growth hormones that they feed to their tragicfarm animals. It was through this technique that they gave us an horrendouschemical concoction, sorry ‘sugar substitute’, or ‘artificial sweetener’, calledaspartame. It is known under trade names like NutraSweet, Equal and Spoonful andis two hundred times sweeter than sugar. But then so am I. Almost everythingthat says ‘no sugar’, ‘no added sugar’, or ‘diet drink’ will be polluted byaspartame. It was manipulated onto the market by Bush Defense Secretary, DonaldRumsfeld, in the early 1980s when he was CEO of the pharmaceutical company, G.D.Searle, before it sold out to … Monsanto. Rumsfeld did this between trips tomeet people like Saddam Hussein to arrange for shipments of chemical andbiological weapons. I can understand the connection because for me aspartame isa chemical weapon for use against the human brain and it is widely used in softdrinks consumed in great quantities by children while their brains are stillforming.Aspartame is reported to have been the subject of 75 per cent of the complaintsreported to the Adverse Reaction Monitoring system of the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). These complaints have included headaches, dizziness,attention difficulties, memory loss, slurred speech and vision problems. Thesesymptoms are now known as ‘aspartame disease’, just as the effects of theflavour-enhancer monosodium glutamate are called monosodium glutamate symptomcomplex. A neuroscientist, John W. Olney of the Washington University MedicalSchool in St Louis, believes there may be a link between aspartame and braintumours. In an article published in the Journal of Neuropathology andExperimental Neurology, he says that animal studies reveal high levels of braintumours in aspartame-fed rats and he also discovered that aspartic acid (one ofthe ingredients of aspartame) caused holes in the brains of infant mice. TheBressler Report, compiled by Food and Drug Administration investigators, foundthat 98 out of 196 animals died during one of Searle’s studies, but autopsieswere delayed, in some cases for more than a year. The report found many other‘mistakes’ and contradictions in the way Searle was testing aspartame. Dr Olneysaid that aspartame had mutagenic (cancer-causing) potential according tostudies and a sharp rise in malignant brain tumours coincided with increased useof aspartame. Even the US Navy and Air Force published articles in NavyPhysiology and Flying Safety warning about the effect of ‘diet’ drinks. Theywere then the main use for aspartame, but now it’s everywhere. One article said:> Several researchers have found aspartame can increase the frequency of> seizures, or lower the stimulation necessary to induce them. This means a> pilot who drinks diet sodas is more susceptible to flicker vertigo, or to> flicker-induced epileptic activity. It also means that all pilots are> potential victims of sudden memory loss, dizziness during instrument flight,> and gradual loss of vision. Dr Ralph G. Walton, Professor of Psychiatry at North Eastern Ohio UniversityCollege of Medicine, reviewed all the studies on aspartame and found 166 withrelevance for human safety. All of the seventy-four studies funded by theaspartame industry gave it the all clear, but 92 per cent of those independentlyfunded revealed safety problems. Aspartame changes brain chemistry and lowersthe threshold for seizures, causes mood disorders and other problems of thenervous system. It is also addictive and people often find it difficult to stopconsuming soft drinks that contain aspartame. A television producer I spent sometime with filming a documentary was drinking something like eight cans of DietCoke a day. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, rheumatoidarthritis, depression and other mood disorders have vanished in many patientsafter they stopped aspartame consumption. Ten per cent of this legalised poisonbreaks down after ingestion into methanol, a nervous system toxin also known asfree methyl alcohol, or wood alcohol. This is extremely harmful to the opticnerve and was the main ingredient of ‘moonshine’ liquor made during the years ofprohibition in America and this was notorious for causing blindness. Methanol israpidly released into the bloodstream where it can become the neurotoxin andcancer-causing formaldehyde and formic acid, the poison in ant stings. A studyby the Institute of Public Health in Hungary showed that aspartame alters genesin various organs and bonemarrow in rats. These include the lymphoreticularorgans of the immune system. When a gene is altered by any source, chemical,radiation or food allergies, it can cause disease. Aspartame is really lovelystuff and people are poisoning their children and themselves by buying anythingthat contains this abomination.Money talks …How, it is fair to ask, did aspartame ever get through the government ‘testing’process? We are dealing with a force that works through all ‘sides’, producerand ‘protector’, and making things happen is far easier than it would be foranyone else. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in America, like itsequivalent in other countries, is a manipulated front to block products that aregood for people, and to push through, without proper testing, those that suitthe agenda. This blatantly happened with aspartame. Searle was getting littlejoy with the FDA until after Donald Rumsfeld was appointed CEO in 1977 and beganto use his insider contacts. By January 1981, with his close associates RonaldReagan and Father George Bush about to enter the White House, Rumsfeld wastelling a sales meeting that he was going to use his political clout inWashington to get aspartame approved rather than continuing with the scientificroute. Rumsfeld was appointed to Reagan’s transition team and arranged for a newFDA Commissioner to be appointed called Dr Arthur Hull Hayes Jr. He immediatelyoverruled the findings of a Public Board of Inquiry in which three of the sixFDA scientists had recommended that approval should be delayed. Aspartame was onits way to the mass consumption it enjoys today. Two years later Dr Hayes Jr.resigned after accepting trips in a jet owned by General Foods, a major user ofaspartame. Hayes was okay, though. He was hired as senior scientific consultantby Searle’s public relations firm, which also represented several users ofaspartame. Hayes was not the only one to benefit from companies they weresupposed to be regulating. An acting FDA commissioner, six other operatives andtwo attorneys assigned to prosecute NutraSweet for submitting fraudulent tests,left the organisation to work for … NutraSweet, a trade name for aspartame. Thereason this poison was approved against all the evidence is simple corruption.One genuine scientist working for the FDA wrote to a US senator:> It’s like a script for Abbott and Costello. It works like this: ‘Approve our> poison, and when you stop being a bureaucrat we’ll make you a plutocrat!’> After it’s licensed we’ll pay off the American Dietetics, the American> Diabetes Association, the American Medical Association and anyone we need> who’s for sale. Coca-Cola knew of the dangers of aspartame. As a member of the National SoftDrink Association, it opposed the approval by the FDA for its use in carbonatedbeverages. These objections were published in the Congressional Record of July5th 1985. The Association said that aspartame was inherently unstable and breaksdown in the can, decomposing into formaldehyde, methyl alcohol, formic acid,diketopiperazine and other toxins. So what is aspartame now doing in Diet Coke,the sales of which soared when it was added because it is so addictive? It isalso in other Coca-Cola drinks, including the latest shite called Coca-Cola Zeroand the ‘sports drink’ called Powerade, which is nothing more than a luminouschemical cocktail. By the way, ‘Diet’ Coke is not ‘diet’ at all. Aspartameincreases the craving for carbohydrates by suppressing the production ofserotonin. Here we go again … suppresses the production of serotonin – a vitalpart of the body’s electrical transmission system. Low levels of serotonin leadto anger, anxiety, apathy, fear, feelings of worthlessness, insomnia andfatigue. Aspartame is also what is called an ‘exitotoxin’ which causesoveractive brain cell activity and damages or kills neurons. This can causestrokes, neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, such asautism, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, andHuntington’s disease, among many others. The ‘flavour enhancer’ monosodiumglutamate (European Union additive code E621) is another excitotoxin that tricksthe brain into decoding more taste than there really is. Most of the allegedtaste in manufactured food is brain trickery. When it says something is cheese‘flavour’ or beef ‘flavour’ it means there is absolutely no cheese or beefinvolved. It’s all chemically created. High levels of glutamic acid have beenshown in animal studies to cause brain damage in areas unprotected by theblood-brain barrier that protects the brain from toxicity. Many of thesechemicals in food and drink have potential to break down that barrier and theresult can be lethal.Bone-rotting, brain-dumbing … fluorideMobile phones are another form of excitotoxicity and so is fluoride, theintellect suppressant added to drinking water supplies and toothpaste. Sodiumfluoride is a common ingredient in rat and cockroach poisons, anaesthetics,hypnotics, psychiatric drugs and military nerve gas. It is one of the basicingredients in the drug, Prozac, and the Sarin nerve gas used in the attack inthe Japanese subway system in 1995. Independent scientific evidence has saidthat fluoride causes various mental disturbances and makes people stupid, docileand subservient. This is besides shortening life spans and damaging bonestructure. The first use of fluoridated drinking water was in the Nazi prisoncamps in Germany, thanks to the Reptilian hybrids’ pharmaceutical giant, I.G.Farben. This was the company that ran camps like Auschwitz and it still existsas its constituent parts, like Bayer. Does anyone think the Nazis did thisbecause they were concerned for the teeth of the inmates? This mass medicationof water supplies with sodium fluoride was to sterilise the prisoners and forcethem into quiet submission. Charles Perkins, a chemist, wrote the following tothe Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on October2nd 1954:> … In the 1930s, Hitler and the German Nazis envisioned a world to be dominated> and controlled by a Nazi philosophy of pan-Germanism. The German chemists> worked out a very ingenious and far-reaching plan of mass-control, which was> submitted to and adopted by the German General Staff. This plan was to control> the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water> supplies. By this method they could control the population in whole areas,> reduce population by water medication that would produce sterility in women,> and so on. In this scheme of mass control, sodium fluoride occupied a> prominent place. Charles Perkins said that repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoridewill in time reduce an individual’s power to resist domination, by slowlypoisoning and ‘narcotising’ a certain area of the brain, thus making peoplesubmissive to the will of those who wish to govern them. He called it a‘convenient light lobotomy’. The real reason behind water fluoridation is not tobenefit children’s teeth, he said. If this was the true motivation there weremany ways in which it could be done that were much easier, cheaper, and far moreeffective, he points out. The real purpose behind water fluoridation is toreduce the resistance of the masses to domination, control and loss of liberty.Perkins said that when the Nazis under Hitler decided to go into Poland, boththe German General Staff and the Russian General Staff exchanged scientific andmilitary ideas, plans and personnel, and the scheme of mass control throughwater medication was seized upon by the Russian communists because it fittedideally into their plan to ‘communise’ the world. Perkins said:> I was told of this entire scheme by a German chemist who was an official of> the great I.G. Farben chemical industries and was also prominent in the Nazi> movement at the time. I say this with all the earnestness and sincerity of a> scientist who has spent nearly twenty years’ research into the chemistry,> biochemistry, physiology and pathology of fluorine – any person who drinks> artificially-fluorinated water for a period of one year or more will never> again be the same person mentally or physically. That is the very reason the Illuminati has been expanding the consumption offluoride. What better way to suppress the minds of the population than throughthe public drinking water supplies, or the toothpaste they use every day? Whenwe drink anything made from fluoridated water, including beer and soft drinks,we are being slowly and consistently drugged and the effects, both physical andmental, are cumulative. The more you drink, the more the stuff builds up in yoursystem year after year. Fluoride is a by-product of the aluminium industry andthe manipulation to add it to public drinking water was engineered by theReptilian hybrid Mellon family in the United States, which controls thealuminium cartel called ALCOA. The Mellons are close friends of the BritishRoyal Family. Industrial fluorines are major polluters of rivers and streams,poisoning land, fish and animals. It was costing the aluminium industry afortune to deal with them. The Mellon family manipulated a situation in whichthis poisonous waste product became an enormous source of income and humancontrol. In 1944, Oscar Ewing was employed by ALCOA at an annual salary of$750,000. Imagine the equivalent figure today. Yet, within months, he left tobecome head of the US government’s Federal Security Agency and began a campaignto add sodium fluoride to public drinking water on the false premise that ithelps to stop tooth decay. The Mellons now sell it for use in drinking water andtoothpaste at a 20,000 per cent mark-up, but, as always, the main reason forfluoride is not money, it’s control. A former mind controller told me of theMellons’ deep involvement with the Illuminati and Satanism. She said that to herknowledge the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is an Illuminatioperation that launders money for them. Would you trust such a family to putchemicals in drinking water and toothpaste because they want to keep your teethhealthy? Not that fluoride does.The cavity conDr Hardy Limeback, head of the Department of Preventive Dentistry for theUniversity of Toronto, and President of the Canadian Association for DentalResearch, was once Canada’s leading promoter of fluoride in water supplies. Thensuddenly he announced he had changed his mind. He said: ‘Children under threeshould never use fluoridated toothpaste or drink fluoridated water, and babyformula must never be made up using Toronto tap water – never.’ A study at theUniversity of Toronto revealed that people in cities which fluoridate theirwater have double the fluoride in their hip bones compared with non-fluoridatedareas, and they discovered that fluoride was changing the ‘basic architecture ofhuman bones’. There is a debilitating condition called skeletal fluorosis causedby the accumulation of fluoride in the bones, making them weak and brittle. Theearliest symptoms are mottled and brittle teeth and Dr Limeback said that inCanada they were spending more money treating dental fluorosis than treatingcavities. But hold on. At least putting this poison in the water and toothpasteis keeping teeth healthy and preventing cavities, yes? Er … no. As Limebackpointed out, they had been putting fluoride in the Toronto drinking water formore than forty years while Vancouver had never been fluoridated, but thepopulation of Vancouver has lower cavity rates than Toronto. He said that cavityrates are low all across the industrialised world – including Europe, which isstill largely fluoride free. This was due, he said, to improved standards ofliving, less refined sugar, regular dental check-ups, flossing and frequentbrushing. There were now fewer than two cavities per child in Canada. He saidthat those who continue to promote fluoride are working with data that is fiftyyears old and questionable at best. ‘The dentists have absolutely no training intoxicity’, he said. ‘Your well intentioned dentist is simply following fiftyyears of misinformation from public health and the dental association. Me, too.Unfortunately, we were wrong.’ It’s not only that we are drinking sodiumfluoride, we are getting all the other crap from the aluminium industry, too.Limeback said:> … certainly the crowning blow was the realization that we have been dumping> contaminated fluoride into water reservoirs for half a century. The vast> majority of all fluoride additives come from Tampa Bay, Florida, smokestack> scrubbers. The additives are a toxic by-product of the super-phosphate> fertilizer industry. > Tragically, that means we’re not just dumping toxic fluoride into our drinking> water. We’re also exposing innocent, unsuspecting people to deadly elements of> lead, arsenic and radium, all of them carcinogenic. Because of the cumulative> properties of toxins, the detrimental effects on human health are> catastrophic. In an address to students at the University of Toronto Department of Dentistry,Dr Limeback told them that he had unintentionally misled his colleagues andstudents. For the past fifteen years, he had refused to study the toxicologyinformation that is readily available to anyone. ‘Poisoning our children was thefurthest thing from my mind,’ he said. ‘The truth was a bitter pill to swallow,but swallow it I did.’ Even though the biggest supporter of fluoride has nowcondemned its use, the Illuminati-controlled Canadian and American DentalAssociations and public ‘health’ agencies, together with those in the UK andworldwide, continue to tell the people that fluoridation is good for them.European Union legislation on food supplements lists fluoride as an essentialelement to be offered to people. This is just one example of ‘the bigger thelie, the more will believe it’. Reptilian hybrid placemen in the positions ofmedical administration and ‘scientific research’ tell the doctors and dentistswhat the ‘truth’ is and what they should believe. They, in turn, tell this totheir patients and the media who simply take the official line and repeat itlike parrots. Hardly anyone does any research of their own – dentists, doctors,‘journalists’, or public – and so it becomes an accepted ‘fact’ that fluoride indrinking water and toothpaste is good for teeth and not harmful. That samescenario is repeated in relation to every subject and, as a result, the humanpopulation lives in its own little Fairyland (Figure 247). This manufacturedillusion is so entrenched in the human psyche that when the truth does come out,most people often laugh in its face.Image [../Images/00256.jpg]Figure 247: The genetically-modified human Once again the pineal gland, vital to our ‘out there’ connection and so muchmore, is a target for fluoride. One study found that melatonin levels were lowerin animals with high fluoride consentrations and it suggested a link betweenfluoride’s affect on the pineal gland and the earlier onset of puberty.Certainly young girls in the United States are reaching puberty earlier andearlier. In November 2006, even the American Dental Association, whichludicrously and outrageously supports fluoride in water, issued an alertadvising parents to avoid fluoridated water in food formula for infants. Yet, aproduct called ‘Nursery Water’, with added fluoride, continues to be sold foryoung children. ‘… When your child is drinking Nursery Water, you can beconfident that your child is getting the right level of fluoride’, says thesales pitch. No words suffice.Big PharmaThe other front in the war on mind and body comes from the Reptilian hybridpharmaceutical cartel, or ‘Big Pharma’. The pharmaceutical and biotechindustries are nothing less than legalised evil. Once again, the ‘modus’ is thesame. These corporations (corporation singular in truth) are controlled by thesame force that controls the governments and they basically get whatever theywant (or at least the very limits of what the public will stand for) when itcomes to laws, or lack of them. They also have their people in the drug andmedical ‘regulatory’ agencies like the FDA in the United States which allowsthem to get drugs onto the market without proper testing, or against the adviceof those who have done proper testing. They control the medical insurancecompanies and they control doctors when it comes to how they treat theirpatients and what drugs they prescribe. With that little lot, they have prettymuch stitched up the whole system. Oh yes, and when a real doctor or otherhealth professional challenges their manipulations and misrepresentations, theyand their glove puppets in governing bodies like the British and AmericanMedical Associations hunt their prey until they are eliminated. This happened tomy friend, Guylaine Lanctot, the Canadian doctor who was targeted by Big Pharmaand the Canadian Medical Association after she wrote her brilliant book calledThe Medical Mafia. Guylaine practiced medicine in more than twenty countries andmany parts of Canada, and she began to question why the treatments and drugswere getting more and more expensive while people were getting sicker. Theanswer was soon clear:> I realised that different systems are totally alike. They have different names> but, whether they are a capitalist system, like we have in the US, or> socialised, like in France, or in between, like in Canada, the bottom line is> that the medical systems are all alike. They all serve financiers and not the> people. That’s the basic thing. The bottom line is that the medical systems> are controlled by financiers in order to serve financiers. Since you cannot> serve people unless they get sick, the whole medical system is designed to> make people sicker and sicker. Guylaine also began to investigate alternative ways of treating patients andtravelled all over the world in the quest for knowledge. She saw that healersshe met were ‘not quacks’ and the results were better and cheaper than ‘normal’medicine. ‘These types of alternative treatments were denied by medicine, andthese innovative health professionals were harassed and persecuted, while doingsomething that helped to bring treatment costs down’, she said. ‘There wassomething definitely wrong here; something didn’t make sense for me, so mysearch was an eye-widening experience’. When The Medical Mafia was published in1995, the medical authorities demanded she resign. ‘Their law says that a doctorspeaking in public can only say what mainstream medicine recognises’, she said.What it recognises is decided by government regulation – controlled by BigPharma. This is how they suppress, intimidate and often jail those using healingmethods that don’t require a scalpel or a drug. Big Pharma is behind the attackon alternative methods of healing for two main reasons: to protect its monopolyon mainstream medicine; and to suppress the alternative vibration-basedtreatments that can not only make people well, but also wake them up mentally,emotionally and spiritually. Guylaine was taken to court when she refused toresign and the case went on for more than a year as the ‘medical’ (Big Pharma)establishment sought to destroy her. In the end, she said, ‘I resigned as asubmitted physician and I declared myself a free physician’. As Voltaire rightlyobserved: ‘It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the establishedauthorities are wrong’. It’s much better to close your mind and mind- lesslyrepeat what you have been told to think, even though it is blatant nonsense. Thesystem uses the carrot for the parrot and the stick for those who resist.Therefore resistance, let alone persistence, is low.Bully boysAnother example of this medical fascism was the case of Dr Andrew Wakefield, theman who first suggested a link between the combined measles, mumps and rubellavaccine, or ‘MMR’, and both autism and bowel problems. He caused aninternational medical storm in 1998 when he and eleven other doctors produced aresearch study which reported bowel symptoms in twelve autistic children andclaimed a possible link with MMR. What followed was a tidal wave of condemnationto discredit his claims by discrediting him – the age-old method used by theestablishment against information it wants to suppress. It has been used on memany times. Wakefield had been hired by lawyers to investigate the link withautism with a view to parents suing the drug companies involved, and he didn’tmention this in the published paper. This was jumped upon to discredit theresearch and ten of the other eleven authors of the report withdrew theirbacking. But, the question remained and remains: are the findings true? This isof little importance to the establishment, which behaves like a hanging posse orinquisition when anyone challenges its dogma and those who fund its gravy train– Big Pharma.Andrew Wakefield, a Canadian-trained gastroenterologist, left the Royal FreeHospital in London by ‘mutual consent’ in the aftermath of his report and hassince worked mostly in the United States, continuing his research at ThoughtfulHouse, a centre for autistic children in Texas. The Reptilian hybridestablishment is always motivated by revenge for those who dare to challenge itsagenda. It may have to wait some time to strike, but it never forgives, norforgets. The General Medical Council (GMC) in Britain charged Dr Wakefield withprofessional misconduct with a view to striking him off and destroying hismedical career and livelihood. He is accused of ‘inadequately founded research,failing to obtain ethical committee approval, obtaining funding improperly andsubjecting children to unnecessary and invasive investigations’. Given theextraordinary numbers of people killed or permanently damaged by doctors anddrug company products every year, the charge of ‘inadequately founded research’would be hilarious if it were not so serious for Wakefield and medical freedom.It is the same with ‘unnecessary investigations’ when you consider the number ofunnecessary drugs and ‘tests’ that doctors prescribe. In the United States,doctors and medical ‘care’ are the third biggest cause of death behind heartdisease and cancer. Dr Barbara Starfield of the John Hopkins School of Hygieneand Public Health produced a report estimating that some 225,000 people dieevery year from such things as: unnecessary surgery (12,000); medication errorsin hospitals (7,000); other errors in hospitals (20,000); infections inhospitals (80,000); and wait for this one, the ‘non-error and negative effectsof drugs’ … 106,000. The medical establishment then has the nerve to point thefinger at Dr Andrew Wakefield. An editorial in Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper,headed ‘MMR and a doctor only doing his duty’, highlighted the real reason forthe attempt to destroy Wakefield. It pointed out that no one had complained tothe General Medical Council about him; nor had anybody suggested that he said orwrote anything dishonest when he believed he had discovered a link between theMMR vaccine and autism. Why, it asked, was the GMC now throwing the book at him?The editorial went on:> The case has the whiff about it of a medieval inquisition, called to defend> the orthodoxy of the establishment against the heresy of an independent mind.> Dr Wakefield’s ‘crime’ was to open an important debate that remains> unresolved. Eight years on, he is by no means alone among doctors in believing> that he may have been on to something. The trouble is we just don’t know. > Even Tony Blair, though publicly committed to the triple vaccine, seems to> have private doubts. What else would explain why he has refused to tell MPs if> his son Leo has been given it? After all, he has never been above dragging his> family into the spotlight, when it suits his political purposes … > … Think what an uproar there would be today if it was discovered that Dr> Wakefield had kept his suspicions to himself and a link had subsequently been> proven. He had a duty to speak out – and now he is being made to suffer for> it. His treatment by the GMC is utterly unjust. If this preposterous body had> existed 200 years ago, defending the prevailing wisdom against new ideas,> doctors would still be treating illnesses by slitting their patients’ veins. Snouts in the troughThe primary motivation for targeting Wakefield is that his findings led to asignificant fall in the number of parents allowing their children to have thecombined MMR vaccine and undermined the confidence the public have invaccinations in general. The whole thing is about money, protecting the power ofBig Pharma and maintaining the chemical attack on the minds and bodies ofchildren. The entire structure of global ‘medicine’ is a web of corruption, liesand deceit and we are talking incredible amounts of money. The top ten drugcompanies make more in profits than the rest of the Fortune 500 list combinedand the world’s top five drug companies have a combined worth that is twice thegross domestic product of sub-Saharan Africa. Andrew Wakefield has been accusedof a conflict of interest over his research on behalf of families with autisticchildren when the bribery of doctors by drug companies is common practice.Doctors-on-the-take is the norm, not the rarity. And I mean bribe, like on amonumental scale. As this Internet article says:> Big Pharma spends nearly $19 billion a year bribing and influencing> physicians, by the way. That’s billion with a ‘B’. How much money is $19> billion? It’s more money than NASA wastes smashing satellites into Mars and> exploding space shuttles in Earth’s upper atmosphere. It’s more money than the> entire junk food industry spends hypnotizing obese children into nagging their> parents for another box of sugar-bomb breakfast cereal at the quickie mart.> Heck, it’s more money than the entire United States spends on genuine disease> prevention and health education. Here we have Dr Wakefield accused of a ‘conflict of interest’ for representingthe families of autistic children while publishing research on the connectionwith MMR when the entire ‘medical’ system is founded on the most astonishingcorruption. The Journal of the American Medical Association has proposed changesto current practice that would:> •Prohibit doctors from accepting free drug samples.> •Exclude doctors who have financial ties to drug companies from serving on the> hospital panels that determine which medicines should be on the preferred> prescribing lists.> •Prohibit drug companies from providing direct financing for educational> programming.> •Prohibit medical faculty from belonging to pharmaceutical companies’> speakers’bureaus, or publishing drug company articles as their own.> •Require faculty members that receive financial support from pharmaceutical> companies to post them on public Internet sites.The suggestion is that the above practices should be stopped, which means, ofcourse, they are all happening now as a matter of course. Jeeez. Take one ofthese examples alone – doctors on the payroll of drug companies deciding throughthe hospital panels which medicines go on the prescribing lists. Do you thinkthey have their patients’ well being on their minds when they do this or thecompanies who fund their big-car, big-house lifestyle? What about ‘medicalfaculty’ publishing drug company articles as their own? Bribery and corruptionof doctors by drug companies is endemic. Doctors are routinely offeredtop-of-the range, all-expenses-paid trips to exotic locations by drug companieson the pretext of ‘conferences’. The ‘conference’ takes a few hours a day, ifindeed they bother turning up, and the rest of the time is a holiday on BigPharma. Doctors are also funded by the drug giants to conduct ‘research’ thatleads them to travel the world. Then there are the incentives to prescribe moredrugs than necessary or send people for hospital tests they don’t need.Professor Ann Blake Tracy writes in Prozac: Panacea or Pandora: ‘Did you knowthat some hospitals offer special incentive deals that give doctors valuablegifts like fax machines and car phones if they schedule surgeries when thehospitals are hurting for business?’ Incentives to play with peoples’ lives andthey claim that doctors represent ‘ethics’? Some do, as with decent policeofficers, but the system doesn’t want them. It wants the corruptible, becausethey are better for business.The bribery and corruption of doctors is a finely-tuned operation by Big Pharma.Kathleen Slattery-Moschkau, a former drug company representative and independentfilmmaker, has detailed how the companies and the reps monitor doctors in theUnited States, down to the last pill, through a system known as ‘prescriberreports’ or ‘prescriber profiles’. These are compiled from various databases.One set of data for the Drug Enforcement Administration has an ID number codingsystem for doctors, along with the drugs they prescribe; another database, the‘physicians master file’ (which is sold for millions every year by the AmericanMedical Association) matches the doctor ID numbers with their names. Put the twotogether, add in some other information sources, and you can establish whoprescribed what and how much. Prescriber reports are issued every week by thedrug companies for internal use. These reports are not to help patient health,but to give Big Pharma reps the information they need to see how successfulthey’ve been in influencing a doctor’s prescribing policy. The reps also usepersonality profiling of the doctors to help with the best way to approach them.Are they people who respond to ‘scientific’ information, or do they like to beflattered? In an article called ‘Spin Doctored’, Shannon Brownlee and JeanneLenzer write:> If Doctor A increased her prescriptions after being treated to a facial and> full-body massage, more expense-paid spa excursions are in order for her. If> Doctor B didn’t respond to a courtesy 5-course meal, then maybe it’s time to> try football tickets, or up the free drug samples, or plug clinical research> that touts the proffered drug’s benefits. Prescriber reports rank doctors in four tiers, based on the amount of drugs theyprescribe. This allows the reps to target the big prescribers – the easypickings – to prescribe even more, while low prescribers can have theirmanipulation increased. This is the true background to drug companies. They aredeeply corrupt cesspit operations structured purely to make as much money aspossible from the sickness, distress and misfortune of others. Like allReptilian hybrid cartels, they have no empathy with those who suffer from theirdaily exploitation.Souls for saleBig Pharma’s other major target is, naturally, the politicians and governmentagencies that decide and enforce (supposedly) medical and drug policy. Figuresfrom the Center for Responsive Politics, Campaign Finance Institute and Centerfor Public Integrity reveal that $158 million was spent by drug companies tolobby the US federal government alone in 2004; $17 million was given in campaigndonations (67 per cent to Republicans), and $7.3 million was spent on politicalparty conventions (64 per cent going to the Republicans). A million dollars wasgiven to the presidential campaign of George Bush and half a million to JohnKerry. Big Pharma has around 1,300 lobbyists in Washington – that’s more thantwo for every member of Congress. ‘They are powerful’, said Senator ChuckGrassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ‘You can hardly swing a catby the tail in that town without hitting a pharmaceutical lobbyist.’ Is it anysurprise that legislation favourable to the drug industry, including immunityfrom prosecution, is constantly passed by the Poodles on the Hill? I saw apicture of Boy Bush signing a Big Pharma-sponsored Medicare Bill, and around himat the desk were ten other grinning politicians as Bush took the pen and triedto remember his name. The Bill helped to increase Big Pharma profits by around$8 billion in the six months after it became law. Bush and the ‘Big Pharma ten’had received a total of $17 million in contributions from the ‘health’ and drugindustry, and Bush alone received $8.5 million. Two of them were RepublicanSenator and Senate majority leader, Bill Frist ($675,000), and the then HouseSpeaker, Dennis Hastert ($740,000). Frist has made a fortune from the familybusiness, the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest private operator ofhealth care facilities in the world, and he’s an archetypal Big Pharmamanipulator. He was at the forefront, with Hastert, of scheming into lawimmunity for the drug cartel for the health effects of vaccines administeredduring a declared state of emergency. It was called the Public Readiness andEmergency Preparedness Act (PREPA) and as one commentator put it:> The PREPA is unconstitutional. It removes the right to due process and> judicial review for persons injured by vaccines, thus granting a virtual> license to kill. Under the new law, companies making vaccines can be grossly> negligent and act with wanton recklessness and still escape liability as long> as they can show that their misconduct wasn’t ‘wilful’. It is impossible to> conceive of a lower standard for the drug companies or a higher burden of> proof for injured parties. Democrat Representative David Obey said the legislation was ‘unilaterally andarrogantly inserted into the Bill after the conference committee was over’. Itwas ‘a blatant power play by the two most powerful men in Congress’ – two menhand in hand with Big Pharma. Frist comes from a medical background and while hewas at medical school he arranged for a regular supply of animals from careshelters by saying he wanted to give them a good home. What he was actuallydoing was killing and dissecting them in his experiments. He now enjoys campaigndonations from the drug cartel and drugmaker Schering-Plough has made itsGulfstream corporate jet available to him.Mercury madnessThis is the web of deceit that connects doctors, politicians, governmentofficials and the drug giants, and yet claims the right to judge and destroy thecareer of Dr Andrew Wakefield because he suggested that their vaccines could beinvolved in autism. In fact, vaccines are responsible for far more than that andthey are still another source of exitotoxins attacking brain activity andstability. Why wouldn’t they be when you see what’s in them? This is from mybook, Infinite Love Is The Only Truth – Everything Else Is Illusion:> Even the process of making the vaccine includes using monkeys, chick embryos> and surgically aborted human foetuses, along with disinfectants and> stabilizers that include streptomycin, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide,> aluminium, hydrochloride, sorbitol, hydrolyzed gelatin, formaldehyde and a> mercury derivative called thimerosal. The Diphtheria, Pertussis (whooping> cough) and Tetanus vaccine contains the following: > Sodium Hydroxide: among other things, this can burn internal organs, cause> blindness, lung and tissue damage, and be fatal if swallowed. It is found in> oven, bathroom and toilet cleaners. > Formaldehyde: a neurotoxin known to cause cancer. It may also cause insomnia,> coughing, headaches, nausea, nosebleeds and skin rashes. It is, appropriately,> used to embalm corpses. > Hydrochloric acid: this can destroy tissue on direct contact and is found in> aluminium cleaners and rust removers. > Aluminium: toxic cancer causer. > Thimerosal: a mercury derivative and extremely dangerous preservative. It is> made from a combination of ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and ethanol,> thiosalicylic acid, sodium hydroxide and ethyl mercuric chloride. These> chemicals are deadly and can cause cancer together with brain and liver> damage. > Phosphates: these suffocate all forms of aquatic life and are found in laundry> and dishwasher detergent and cleaners. This poisonous trash is attacking the very immune system it is supposed to besupporting and yet in fascist-controlled America parents are being taken tocourt for not allowing such potential killers to be given to their children. Thepublic is frightened into accepting this tyranny by being told of the potentialeffects on their children of coming into contact with non-immunised kids. But ifthey’ve been vaccinated, there shouldn’t be a problem should there? Oh, butthere is. It’s just that they don’t want you to know. For a start, mercury isthe prime suspect when it comes to autism in children (Figure 248). As thenumber of mercury-contaminated vaccines increased between 1989 and the late1990s, so did the number of children becoming autistic. Figures from the USgovernment’s own databases, published in the Journal of American Physicians andSurgeons, reveals that since mercury was removed from most childhood vaccines(not others) after 1999, the reported rates of autism and other neurologicaldisorders in children have plummeted by as much as 35 per cent. An article atWorldNetDaily.com [http://WorldNetDaily.com] notes:> Up until about 1989, pre-school children got only three vaccines – polio, DPT> and MMR. By 1999, the CDC [Centers for Disease Control] recommended a total of> 22 vaccines to be given before children reach the first grade, including> Hepatitis B, which is given to newborns within the first 24 hours of birth.> Many of these vaccines contained mercury. In the 1990s, approximately 40> million children were injected with mercury-containing vaccines. Image [../Images/00257.jpg]Figure 248: The vaccine horror movie How amazing, then, that rates of autism soared between 1989 and 2003 with nowmore than half a million autistic children in the United States. Dr RashidButtar told the Congressional Reform and Oversight Hearing Subcommittee onWellness and Human Rights about his remarkable success in treating autism simplyby removing mercury from the children’s bodies. His own son, Abi, made a fullrecovery from autism after mercury detoxification. As Dr Bob Nash, chairman ofthe American Board of Clinical Metal Toxicology, said: ‘When thirty-one childrenrecover from a devastating disease by a simple transdermal treatment thatdetoxifies metals, then common sense dictates that perhaps metals are involved’.The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREPA), signed by PresidentBush after massive lobbying and manipulation by the drug cartel, means thatmercury can now be reintroduced to vaccines when used in immunity fromprosecution situations, and they can continue to send these mercury potions tothe developing world. The authors of a report on autism, David A. Geier B.A.,and Mark R. Geier, M.D., Ph.D., warn that people should not be complacentbecause they are told that mercury-based thimerosal has been removed from manychildhood vaccines. We are talking childhood vaccines and, even then, not all ofthem. The report says:> Despite its removal from many childhood vaccines, thimerosal is still> routinely added to some formulations of influenza vaccine administered to US> infants, as well as to several other vaccines (e.g. tetanus-diphtheria and> monovalent tetanus) administered to older children and adults. In 2004, the> Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences retreated from> the stated 1999 goal of the AAP and the PHS to remove thimerosal from US> vaccines as soon as possible ... As a result, assessing the safety of> [thimerosal-containing vaccines] is a matter of significant importance. Vaccines are not the only source of mercury poison. That’s what they use to fillteeth! The reason the authorities in every area of society don’t act with‘common sense’ is because they are following an agenda of their own, and what iscommon sense to us is lethal to the agenda. This is why apparently inexplicabledecisions are taken. When you know what they are trying to achieve there isnothing ‘inexplicable’ about them. Big Pharma and its payrolled puppy dogs ingovernment have told us all along that there is no link between autism andvaccinations when they know there is. They are following the plan for humansuppression and control in which vaccinations play a major role. Vaccines areone of the Reptilian hybrids’ most significant ‘victories’ in their developmentof access keys to the body-computer. They have so manipulated medical andparental minds with false information that almost from birth children are handedto the Frankenstein industry to be injected with poison designed to suppresstheir immune system and short-circuit their brains. It is the immune system, ouranti-virus software, which removes potential threats to the computer before theycan take hold. Without an immune system we would not last a few minutes and thestronger and more efficient it is the healthier we are. Cancer cells are formingall the time, but the immune system seeks them out and removes them. It is onlywhen the immune system is overwhelmed or not functioning properly that we becomeill. Dr Russell L. Blaylock said in an Internet article:> Because more and more reports are appearing citing vaccine failure, their> manufacturers’ answer is to make the vaccines more potent. They do this by> making the immune adjuvants [metals and poisons] more powerful or adding more> of them. The problem with this approach is that in the very young, the> nutritionally deficient and the aged, over-stimulating the immune system can> have an opposite effect – it can paralyze the immune system. Even on the financial level alone, healthy people are not good for Big Pharmabusiness and anything that can suppress the immune system is guaranteed to getthe tills a ticking. It is also far easier to control a sick population,operating on far less than their physical and mental potential, than it is ifthey are fit and sharp in body and mind. Vaccines serve these twin ambitionsperfectly. This is why:> 1)They attack the immune system with their chemical and metallic poisons, like> mercury.> 2)This undermines the strength and effectiveness of the immune system and the> chemical/electrical balance of the brain/body.> 3)The victims become open to all sorts of medical and mental consequences> because of overwhelmed immune systems and chemical/electrical imbalances.It is simple and devastatingly effective – so long as you can frighten peopleinto being stupid enough to allow these cocktails of chemical excrement to beinjected into themselves and their children. Clearly that is not a problem. Oneof the causes of vaccine damage would appear to be inflammation at the base ofthe brain that dissolves the nerve insulator called myelin. When this happens,the brain short-circuits, the body receives flawed information and this causesdis-harmony or dis-ease. The website, mult-sclerosis.org, puts it like this:> Myelin is an electrically insulating fatty layer that surrounds the axons of> many neurons, especially those in the peripheral nervous system. Myelin> facilitates the smooth, high-speed transmission of electrochemical messages> between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. When myelin is> lost, these signals become distorted or blocked, causing symptoms experienced> by people with such diseases as multiple sclerosis and transverse myelitis. Once you imbalance the ‘electrochemical’ system anything can happen and, forreasons I have explained, this is what the Reptilian hybrids are seeking to dowith vaccines, drugs, food additives and electromagnetic pollution that includesmobile phones and TETRA masts. The UK government, via its staggeringly inept‘Chief Medical Officer’, Sir Liam Donaldson, announced that children will havetwenty-five vaccinations before they reach the age of two. He says withabsolutely no evidence worth the name that additional vaccinations will savefifty lives a year. He has nothing to say about how many more lives they willcost or ruin. The situation is much the same in the United States. I suggestthat it is no coincidence that cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) haveincreased in the same period that mass vaccination has been with us. In onearea, Olmstead County, Minnesota, the number of cases grew from .55 per 1000births in 1953 to 12.8 per 1000 in 1992. The national average in the same periodrose from 2.5 to 17.9. Most of these unexplained child deaths, also known as‘cot deaths’, happen between two and four months and the overwhelming majorityin the first six months. This is when they are being pummelled with vaccines. DrWilliam Torch of the University of Nevada School of Medicine at Reno reportedthat twelve infant deaths that he investigated came within three and a half andnineteen hours after having the triple DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus)vaccine. He said that another eleven deaths from SIDS that he studied occurredwithin twenty-four hours of the vaccination, and in another study he found thattwo-thirds of the seventy child deaths he investigated came between half a dayand three weeks of immunisation. Yet, vaccination as the possible cause wasnever considered by the authorities, because that is the god that none darequestion.As I keep stressing, the focus of the Reptilian hybrids is to disrupt brainfunction and the sooner they can start after a child is born the more effectivethis can be. They are rearranging the electrochemical systems while the brain isstill forming. Excitotoxicity keeps coming up with all these drugs andadditives, and vaccines are no different. They reduce the strength of the immunesystem in general by keeping it constantly active and it does the same to thecritical immune system that protects the brain. Dr Russell L. Blaylock wrote anInternet article headed ‘What They Don’t Tell You About Vaccination Dangers CanKill You or Ruin Your Life’. He highlighted the effects of vaccines on brainfunction:> It seems the brain is always neglected when pharmacologists consider side> effects of various drugs. The same is true for vaccinations. For a long time> no one considered the effect of repeated vaccinations on the brain. This was> based on a mistaken conclusion that the brain was protected from immune> activation by its special protective gateway called the blood-brain barrier.> More recent studies have shown that immune cells can enter the brain directly,> and more importantly, the brain’s own special immune system can be activated> by vaccination … > … Numerous studies have shown that when the body’s immune system is activated,> the brain’s immune cells are likewise activated. This occurs by several> pathways, not important to this discussion. The more powerfully the body’s> immune system is stimulated the more intense is the brain’s reaction.> Prolonged activation of the body’s immune system likewise produces prolonged> activation of the brain’s immune system. Once the brain’s immune cells are activated, they move through the nervoussystem spreading immune chemicals and some of them, such as glutamate andquinolinic acid, are once again excitotoxins that can cause serious damage tobrain activity. This process also releases powerful chemical by-products, calledfree radicals, which, says Dr Blaylock, ‘are very reactive particles that bounceall around the cell damaging everything they touch’. Free radicals can betriggered by exposure to toxins, radiation and toxic metals and what do they putin vaccines? Toxic metals like mercury. Dr Blaylock says that with so manyvaccines administered so close together over such a long period, the brain’simmune system is constantly activated and this ensures that it will be exposedto large amounts of excitotoxins. The effects are compounded, Dr Blaylock says,in children:> In the child, brain immune over-activation has been shown to be particularly> damaging to the amygdala and other limbic structures of the brain. This can> lead to unusual syndromes such as the loss of ‘theory of mind’ and ‘Alice in> Wonderland syndrome’. It has also been shown to damage the executive functions> of the frontal lobes. In essence, what is lost is that which makes us social> human beings, able to function in a complex world of ideas and interactions. The power that controls Big Pharma and orchestrates its horrors is beingconcentrated in ever-fewer hands. In 1995, twenty-five companies controlled morethan half the global drugs market; by 2000, it was just fifteen and the mergershave continued since then. This Big Pharma merger-mania is, as with every otheraspect of society, centralising power over vaccines, drugs and the medicalsystem in general. Even now, only real doctors with balls to match are preparedto take them on. Whenever I hear the term, ‘family doctor’, my heart sinks and Ihave visions of ‘repeaters’ in suits parroting the party line so essential tokeeping their job and maintaining the support of the authorities. It is solucrative for doctors who play the game and pressure their patients to havetheir immune defences, and those of their children, consumed by the cocktailconcoctions that issue from corporations like Merck, GlaxoSmithKline andSanofi-Aventis. The ten largest pharma giants made profits of $40 billion in thefirst six months of 2006 alone, so there is plenty of swill in the trough to oilthe wheels within wheels and make sure that vaccinations are good for themedical profession, if not for the people it treats. The British governmentoffers financial incentives to doctors, known as the Target Payments System, tomeet their vaccination quotas and the goal of the government–Big Pharma cartelis compulsory vaccinations. In America, they are almost there with all fiftystates demanding a large number of vaccinations before children are allowed toattend public schools or day care centres. There are some exceptions, but notmany, and the pressure on parents to poison their kids is enormous. Indeed,refusing to poison your children is presented as a form of child abuse. Such isthe Alice in Wonderland world that we live in. With a name likefamilydoctor.org, you’d expect the official view to be blindly presented andthere’s no disappointment here. It tells me that ‘vaccines not only help keepyour child healthy, they help all children by stamping out serious childhooddiseases’. Well, that’s really strange because my son, Jaymie, aged fourteen atthe time of writing, has never had a vaccination of any kind in his life andhe’s never had a ‘childhood disease’, unlike his vaccinated friends. Also, whenhis health was checked physically and energetically, the practitioner said thatJay was the healthiest person he had ever tested. Jaymie’s speed of recovery,both from illness and sporting injury, is stunning. Why? Because his immunesystem is on fire. It only has to fight disease, not open endless otherbattlefronts to deal with the attacks from vaccinations.Rewriting historyAlthough there may be dangers, I have heard people say, at least vaccinesprevent diseases and have eradicated so many that children used to get. This isstill more repeating. There is nothing more effective in programming perceptionsthan repetition, especially if it comes from a guy in a suit with letters afterhis name, or a bloke in a white coat. But repetition does not mean fact. Theytell you that cases of childhood diseases fell rapidly after vaccines wereintroduced, but in truth this was happening before anyone was vaccinated (Figure249). It was brought about by better nutrition, sanitation, living conditionsand cleaner water. Figures from Vital Statistics of the United States show thatdeaths from typhoid fell by 91 per cent from 1910 to 1937 and death fromdiphtheria declined by 90.5 per cent in the same period. All this was wellbefore vaccination was introduced. The Journal of Pediatrics could not beclearer:> … The largest historical decrease in morbidity and mortality caused by> infectious disease was experienced not with the modern antibiotic and vaccine> era, but after the introduction of clean water and effective sewer systems. Image [../Images/00258.jpg]Figure 249: How disease rates were plummeting before vaccines arrived and thefalls even began to slow or plateau when immunisation began Think about it. Why are poor countries today ravaged by killer childhood diseaseepidemics long gone from the ‘developed world’? Is it because they are not beingvaccinated – as Big Pharma wants us to believe? No. It’s because of theconditions the children have to live in, their general health, or lack of it,and immune system depletion. A paper published in the Journal of InfectionControl in 2001 states:> Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine arrived on the scene only after> disease mortality rates already had been reduced significantly; measles,> rubella, and polio vaccines did not become available until the middle of the> 20th century, when most infant deaths were the result of other causes. The> same holds true for sulfa drugs and antibiotics. A Department of Community Medicine paper published in the UK medical journal TheLancet in 1977 confirms the same theme. It says this about deaths from whoopingcough:> There was a continuous decline equal in each sex, from 1937 onward.> Vaccination, beginning on a small scale in some places around 1948 and on a> national scale in 1957, did not affect the rate of decline if it be assumed> that one attack usually confers immunity, as in most major communicable> diseases of childhood … > … The steady decline of whooping cough between 1930 and 1957 is predictive of> a linear exponential decay characteristic of a general and progressive> lessening in the volume and spread of infection among the susceptible> population. With this pattern well established before 1957, there is no> evidence that vaccination played a major role in the decline in incidence and> mortality in the trend of events. The story that vaccines are essential to immunity is just that, a story,repeated until it became accepted ‘fact’. One of America’s most celebratedpaediatricians, the late Robert Mendelsohn, said:> There has never been a single vaccine in this country that has ever been> submitted to a controlled scientific study. They never took a group of 100> people who were candidates for a vaccine, gave fifty of them a vaccine and> left the other fifty alone to measure the outcome. And since that hasn’t been> done, that means if you want to be kind, you will call vaccines an unproven> remedy. If you want to be accurate, you’ll call people who give vaccines> ‘quacks’. Since 1975 when Germany stopped insisting on whooping cough vaccination, lessthan ten per cent of children are vaccinated. The result … the number of casesof whooping cough has fallen. It remains endemic in the Netherlands where, fortwenty years, 96 per cent of children have received three whooping coughvaccinations by age twelve months. In American schools with 98 per cent to 100per cent immunisation rates for measles, the disease still breaks out. Thisapplies even in areas where there have been no reported cases for years. Deathsfrom measles in Britain had already dropped 97 per cent before the vaccine wasintroduced. Millions of children in poor countries are still dying from measles,tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio etc., despite being fully vaccinated. Atuberculosis vaccine trial in India involving more than 260,000 Indians resultedin more cases of TB among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. This vaccine isstill being given to Australian children and others around the world. On and onit goes. Still people dutifully line up their children for the Dr Deaths to pokethem in the arm with toxic garbage, and we are asked to contribute to charitycampaigns to vaccinate children en masse in the developing world, or applaudwhen the Bill Gates Foundation gave $1.5 billion to the cause of immune systemdestruction and brain function suppression. The Gates Foundation website says:> Vaccines save lives. Too often, though, they are unavailable to the world’s> poorest children. Through its support of the GAVI Alliance, the foundation has> invested more than $1.5 billion to increase the number of children in> developing countries who receive recommended immunizations, encourage the> adoption of vaccines that are underused, speed up the introduction of new> vaccines, and secure funding for childhood immunization. No wonder Bill Gates and Bill Clinton get along so well as they both strive todrug and vaccinate Africa. When you have your people manipulating all sides, theReptilian hybrid-controlled World Health Organization can announce there isgoing to be an epidemic of something or other, and the Reptilian hybrid agentsin government can start a mass vaccination against this alleged ‘danger’, viathe medical profession. The Reptilian hybrid drug companies can then sell themthe vaccines. As well as the contribution of the Gates Foundation, massvaccination programmes in the ‘Third World’ are funded and administered throughthe Reptilian hybrids’ World Bank, World Heath Organization, and other UNagencies. This allows them to target certain groups or races in their campaignof genocide. Guylaine Lanctot says in her book, The Medical Mafia:> Vaccination decimates populations. Drastically in Third World countries.> Chronically in industrialized countries. In this regard, Robert McNamara> [Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, CFR], the former President of the> World Bank, former Secretary of State in the United States, who ordered> massive bombing of Vietnam, and a member of the Expanded Program on> Immunization, made some very interesting remarks. As reported by a French> publication, J’ai tout compris, he was quoted as stating: ‘One must take> draconian measures of demographic reduction against the will of the> populations. Reducing the birth rate has proved to be impossible or> insufficient. One must therefore increase the mortality rate. How? By natural> means. Famine and sickness’. Guylaine says that vaccination enables the selected populations to be decimated.It allows ‘targeted genocide’ and permits the killing of people from a certainrace, group, or country, while leaving others untouched. That’s just what theProject for the New American Century called for … ‘advanced forms of biologicalwarfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes …’ All can be done in the name ofhealth and well being. In early 2007, the US-controlled Iraqi government andUnited Nations agencies announced their intention to immunise nearly fourmillion Iraqi children aged between one and five with the MMR vaccine. As ifthose kids have not suffered enough. Diseases have been dispersed among ‘ThirdWorld’ populations through vaccination and water supplies, including AIDS. DrSidney Gottlieb, one of the major players in the MKULTRA mind control operation,told a hearing investigating the CIA that he dispersed a large quantity ofviruses into the Congo River in Zaire in 1960 to contaminate the water used fordrinking by local people. Dr Gotlieb went on to become head of the NationalCancer Institute to further his campaign to ‘fight disease’. Cancer researchorganisations, to which people give millions of pounds through charityfundraising worldwide, are more fronts to stop the discovery of a cure thatthose on the inside know exists. If you give money to them, you are giving it tothe Reptilian hybrid conspiracy, although the genuine people shaking theircollection tins in the street are not aware of this.Scientists on the takeAh, yes, scientists. There are genuine ones as there are in all theseprofessions, but most are the tools of those who fund them – and guess who thatis? It is crucial that the Reptilian hybrids control science and not only toproduce the pills, potions and technology necessary for their plan to succeed.Equally, they need to use ‘science’ to suppress, dismiss and block those whohave developed ways and means in health and technology to bring about positivechange that could scupper the plan. They also desperately need to keep the truthabout the nature of reality from the people and their ‘science’ is used to dothat by promoting the lie that it’s all an accident of ‘evolution’. The majorfunding is awarded to research those areas that suit the system with often theoutcome decided before the work begins and, like doctors, there are manyscientists with souls for sale who will say what their paymasters demand. A goodexample of how the ‘science’ web is spun is the case of Sir Richard Doll, aworld-renowned cancer specialist, who, it turns out, was being paid for twentyyears as a consultant by the Reptilian hybrid operation, Monsanto, while notrevealing this fact in his ‘independent’ reports. Sir Richard is noted formaking the connection between smoking and lung cancer, but he also spent twodecades investigating potential cancer causes in the chemical industry whilebeing paid $1,500 a day by one of the biggest chemical corporations which is nowpromoting aspartame and genetically-modified food. Monsanto was a producer ofAgent Orange, the lethal herbicide and defoliant used by American forces in theVietnam War for ten years up to 1971. It contained dioxins that have causedgreat damage to health among the civilians and troops exposed to it. As aresult, lawsuits were filed against producers like Monsanto and Dow Chemical,with American veterans winning $180 million in compensation in 1984. Australian,New Zealand and Korean victims also won compensation, though not the Vietnamese.Studies indicate the increased risks of cancer and genetic defects from exposureto dioxin, but Sir Richard Doll wrote to a Royal Australian Commissioninvestigating Agent Orange to say there was no evidence that this was the case.He did not mention that every day he was pocketing $1,500 from Monsanto.Documents revealed in late 2006 also show that Sir Richard Doll was paid $15,000by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, Dow Chemical (another Agent Orangeproducer) and the British chemical giant, ICI. For this money, he produced an‘independent’ review that largely dismissed claims that the vinyl chloride usedin plastics could be linked to cancers, except for those of the liver. The WorldHealth Organisation challenges that assertion, but it suited his paymasters andthey used his report to defend the chemical’s safety for a decade. Sir Richarddied in 2005, but his contract with Monsanto is filed at the Wellcome Trustlibrary archive. It began on May 10th 1979 and was extended with improved termson April 29th 1986. ‘During the one-year period of this extension yourconsulting fee shall be $1,500 per day’, it says. As late as 2000, Sir Richardwas a witness for Solutia, a spin-off from Monsanto.What we have here is one small glimpse at the corruption and conflicts ofinterest that consume much of what is bravely called ‘science’. Wherever dollarsigns appear, ethics have a fight on their hands. The obsession with money is atthe heart of all corruption and the Reptilian hybrid corporations know that.They are well aware that they will not have to look far to find a ‘scientist’ tosay what suits their stance so long as the cheque is in the post. The more‘renowned’ the scientist, the bigger the cheque – and the more effective thecontribution to misleading public perception. The idea most of the time is noteven to ‘win’ the argument over the effect of a drug, chemical, GM food orwhatever, because they know that on facts and commonsense the odds are stackedagainst them. The arguments are often complex and full of science-speak andneither position is able to land the deciding punch until the effects havebecome clear in the consequences for public health. Their primary goal is tothrow confusion and conflict into the ‘debate’ to muddy the waters and preventany clear presentation of the facts. This is done by finding ‘scientists’ whoare willing to put the argument that suits the corporations and, although thismay have no validity, it dilutes the clarity there would otherwise be. In thisway, warnings about the potential dangers of a food additive, sugar substituteand all these other drug and chemical concoctions, are ignored for years, evendecades, before unmistakable health effects become obvious. By then, it’s toolate for those who have suffered or died. The corporations use their on-the-take‘scientists’ to counter the warnings and persuade government agencies that thereis no ‘proof’ that a substance will be harmful.In any sane society a company would have to provide proof that the chemical wasnot harmful before entering public use and this would clip the power of thechemical giants overnight. The corporate-political nexus destroyed the integrityof what we call ‘science’ long, long ago. We know that ‘scientists’ officiallyemployed by the corporations will say whatever suits their puppeteers, butclearly many ‘independent’ scientists are also on the pay roll and this is farmore significant because ‘independent’ research carries more weight in thepublic mind. Corruption is the fundamental absence of integrity and this plagueis an epidemic throughout the system – ‘science’ included. The exposure of SirRichard Doll is a warning to everyone who believes in the credibility of‘scientists’ when they make their pronouncements about what is good for us. Thisis especially true when the system’s ‘experts’ are dismissing and condemningother forms of healing, or telling us there is no life after ‘death’. They aredefending the dogma on which the system and the conspiracy depend, and if theydon’t do so their careers and the buffer stops will get well acquainted.Global fascismBig Pharma doesn’t want people to reject the scalpel and the drug for othertreatments and where they can’t destroy something, such as health food storesand food and vitamin supplements, they buy them up and turn them into corporatechains that no longer sell the quality of what was there before. One of BigPharma’s main attacks on personal choice and health freedom is something calledthe Codex Alimentarius, which is Latin for ‘food code’ or ‘food book’. It is thework of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. This is controlled by thepharmaceutical cartel, the World Health Organisation (itself controlled by thepharmaceutical cartel) and the United Nations, the creation of the Reptilianhybrid bloodlines. It claims, using the usual Orwellian language, to be seekinginternational ‘harmonisation’ in health and food supplements. The real deal isto criminalise health products and information about them that are not undertheir control and to severely limit dosages to the point where taking them willalmost be a waste of time and money. The laws decided by this Big Pharma cartelwould replace those in your country and they are enforceable through theReptilian hybrid World Trade Organisation that can impose massive fines andtrade sanctions on nations that don’t comply. The legislation and agreements forthis were being quietly put into place while the world was watching Friends, ThePrice is Right, football or baseball, or being diverted by the latest celebrity‘news’. Anything that talks about ‘harmonisation’ is Newspeak for global lawsthat every country must obey and it is happening everywhere. The fullintroduction of the Codex Alimentarius agenda would mean:> •Dietary supplements could not be sold for preventive or therapeutic use.> •Potencies would be limited to extremely low dosages. Only Big Pharma would> have the right to produce and sell the higher potency products and dictate the> price.> •Prescriptions would be required for anything above extremely low doses.> •Some common foods would be classified as drugs, or a third category (neither> food nor drugs) that only Big Pharma could regulate and sell. Any food with> any therapeutic effect could be considered a drug.> •Codex regulations for dietary supplements would become binding with all> escape clauses eliminated.> •All new dietary supplements would be banned unless they go through Codex> testing and approval.> •Nearly all food would have to be irradiated.> •Genetically altered food would be sold worldwide without labelling.The Codex laws would define dietary supplements as drugs and toxins and not asfoods, as they are now. This means they would go through toxicology testingwhich is designed to ensure that a substance has no discernible effect on thebody. Taking those supplements that remain available would, therefore, be nextto useless. All dairy cows worldwide would have to be treated with Monsanto’srecombinant bovine growth hormone and all animals produced for food would haveto be given antibiotics – even those from organic producers. Seven out of ninecancer-causing organic chemicals known as ‘Pops’, or Persistent OrganicPollutants, which are banned in nearly a hundred-and-eighty countries, includingthe United States, would be allowed again by Codex Alimentarius because it wouldoverride all national laws.It is nothing less than global fascism and so how appropriate that CodexAlimentarius was instigated by those who controlled I.G. Farben, thepharmaceutical cartel at the heart of the Nazi war machine. It ran theconcentration camp at Auschwitz. The cartel was made up of corporations likeBASF, Bayer and Hoechst, which, of course, still exist today. I.G. Farben wasthe biggest single funder of Hitler’s election and made fantastic profits fromthe Second World War. A US government investigation in 1946 concluded that,without I.G. Farben, the war in which more than fifty million died would nothave been possible. It also used concentration camp inmates to test unsafepharmaceutical drugs and vaccines that killed many. The Nuremberg War CrimeTribunal prosecuted twenty-four Farben executives and board members for crimesagainst humanity, including mass murder and slavery. Telford Taylor, the US leadprosecutor at Nuremberg, said of the Farben executives:> Not the Nazi lunatics but these accused are responsible for this war. And if> they are not punished for these crimes the harm they will do to future> generations is much greater than Hitler could ever have done if he were alive. That is precisely what they have done. Those that Telford Taylor condemned andwarned about were allowed to resume their posts with Hoechst, Bayer and BASF,the ‘Farben Three’, thanks to … Nelson Rockefeller, US Undersecretary of Stateand former Farben business partner. One of them, Fritz ter Meer, thehighest-ranked ‘scientist’ on the Farben board, had said of human experiments inthe concentration camps: ‘Forced labour did not inflict any remarkable injury,pain, or suffering on the detainees, particularly since the alternative forthese workers would have been death’. It was ter Meer who devised the slogan atthe entrance to Auschwitz: ‘Arbeit mach frei’ (‘Work makes you free’). This sameFritz ter Meer was released after serving four years of a seven-year sentenceand was reinstated to the supervisory board at Bayer in 1955 before becomingchairman a year later. It was ter Meer and other executives of BASF, Bayer andHoechst who were behind the creation of Codex Alimentarius that was officiallylaunched in 1963. They set out to control food because that means control of thepeople and their creation is now closing in on that goal. Canadian politician,Paul Hellyer, says in his book, The Evil Empire:> Codex Alimentarius is supported by international banks and multinational> corporations including some in Canada, and is in reality a Bill of rights for> these banks and the corporations they control. It will hand over our sovereign> rights concerning who may or may not invest in our countries to an unelected> world organization run by big business.

This> world is an absolute certainty if we all sit on our hands and do nothing. What greater definition of fascism can there be than to have what we can andcannot do with our own bodies, and in pursuit of our own health, dictated to usin such depth and detail? What is happening is so blatant when you connect thedots. As I have been stressing for so many years now, the Reptilian hybrids havelaunched a multi-level assault on the human immune system and theelectrochemical communication networks of the brain and body. This is the key tounderstanding the connection between Big Pharma drugs and vaccinations, food anddrink additives, cell phones and cell phone communication masts, TETRA masts andtechnology, genetically-modified food, microwave ovens and irradiated food, thesoaps and lotions that we put on our hair and skin, and all the othermanufactured sources of excitotoxins and electrochemical poisons. In turn, theseconnect with the attacks on clean food and water sources, supplements, herbalremedies and alternative ways of healing that are being regulated intocentralised dictatorships. When you know what is going on it is no longer amystery why patents are refused, or hijacked by military intervention, when newforms of healing technology are developed outside the Big Pharma cartel, or whypeople healing those dubbed ‘terminally ill’ are not feted as heroes, butarrested and jailed. True healers identify, treat and remove the energyimbalances that are causing the physical effect and the Reptilian hybrids, theNefilim, don’t want that.They seek to destabilise us mentally, emotionally and physically, because apopulation suppressed in these ways, and one that doesn’t know it is happening,can be controlled far easier than people who are mentally alert, emotionallystable and physically healthy. The consequences involve our multi-dimensionalconnections, too. My great friend, Credo Mutwa, the Zulu high shaman in SouthAfrica, tells me that they will only accept non-vaccinated people to be trainedas ‘sangomas’ (diviners and healers) because of the effect vaccines have on theability to get ‘out there’. This comes from the way brain chemistry andelectrical communication is destabilised. Personally, I am sure this can beovercome when consciousness is open enough and strong enough to override thebiological computer we call the brain/body. But the point is taken. Vaccinesmake it a far greater challenge, and so do all the sources of suppression that Ihave outlined in the last few chapters. Everything leads eventually to theReptilian hybrid networks after thousands of years of manipulation anddeveloping control – everything from our food, water, ‘medical care’, ‘news andinformation’, ‘entertainment’, transport, government and military. Add to thatlittle lot the mind-control programmes, drug trafficking and wars. The samefamilies and their bag men and women control all of these and much more. Thewriter Michael Ellner said:> Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors> destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge,> governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions> destroy spirituality. If you have read this far you will now see why all this is so. It is designed tobe like that. These things are not happening because the authorities are stupid,not at the controlling level, anyway. When you have the coordinates for what thegame is, how it is played and to what end, you can see that it is a work ofgenius, not incompetence.To summarise our plight as succinctly as I can: We’re in the shit, basically –but we don’t have to stay there."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/00005.jpg] 27 The carbon con > Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with> surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never> given a fair hearing. > George Orwell The latest swindle on the road to tyranny is ‘global warming’, or ‘climatechange’. It is being used to introduce a whole new strata of taxation,regulation and control in the name of ‘saving the planet’ – and it’s all agigantic fraud. I am not saying that temperatures are not rising, but what Ichallenge is the cause. The lie is in the why.The self-appointed High Priest of this new religion is His Holiness Al Gore,spiritual leader of the Global Warmers, and the climate change evangelist in thegas-guzzling limo. Gore has become the face of global warming after his 2006Paramount film, An Inconvenient Truth. It became the third most successfuldocumentary in American box office history and predictably won the Oscar forbest documentary feature. I say predictably, because global warming is now ‘in’,the latest intellectual fashion accessory, and has replaced fur coats and Africaas the new concern of choice among the Hollywood luvees. Gore’s book, alsocalled An Inconvenient Truth, reached number one in The New York Times’bestseller list and he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. This corrupt anddeceitful man has become the darling of the Greens and many more besides – ‘goodold Al, we love ya baby’. Cue alarm bells, cue flashing lights, cue anythingthat says ‘conman at work’. I have been unconvinced by the official story ofglobal warming for a long time and I was not in the least surprised when anIlluminati operative like Al Gore became centrally involved. If this man tellsyou something, it’s not true. He is being promoted and feted by the Reptilianhybrid PR machine because he is fronting up another Big Lie on the road toglobal tyranny. His documentary has been sent to every secondary school inBritain as part of the campaign to indoctrinate young people with the falseperception that global warming is caused by human activity with all thepotential that has for control, taxation, suppression, international law andcentralisation of power.The alleged villain, the ‘Satan’ of the new religion, is the ‘greenhouse gas’carbon dioxide belching from exhaust pipes and the industrial system in general.It is claimed that this is collecting in the atmosphere and forming a barrier tostop solar heat from escaping. We are urged to become ‘carbon neutral’ and towash away our sins with ‘carbon offsets’, the cult’s version of baptism. It isstill okay for the rich like Gore to pollute as much as they choose so long asthey invest in green technologies or pay someone to plant a tree. We even haveplans for ‘emissions trading’ in which companies that want to pollute beyondtheir government-imposed allowance can buy ‘carbon credits’ from those whoproduce less than their carbon limit. If it all sounds complex to you, don’tworry. Al has thought of everything. Not only is he the voice of the carbon-con,he has set up a company to help you buy your carbon neutrality. It’s theLondon-based Generation Investment Management, which he set up in 2004 with theformer chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, David Blood. Thecompany is appropriately nicknamed ‘Blood and Gore’. As an Internet writer putit:> So Al can buy his carbon offsets from himself. Better yet, he can buy them> with the money he gets from his long-time relationship with Occidental> Petroleum. See how easy it is to be carbon-neutral? All you have to do is own> a gazillion stocks in Big Oil, start an eco-stockbroking firm to make> eco-friendly investments, use a small portion of your oil company’s profits to> buy some tax-deductible carbon offsets from your own investment firm, and you> too can save the planet while making money and leaving a carbon footprint> roughly the size of Godzilla’s at the start of the movie when they’re all> standing around in the little toe wondering what the strange depression in the> landscape is. Al Gore, what a man, what a god. He creates a company and then produces apromotional video for it that wins him an Oscar and a Nobel Prize nomination.Now that’s style, and there’s more. We now have Gore and his team of ‘climatechange – scientists’ training other ‘little Als’ to present his version ofglobal warming to groups all over the United States; Gore and Richard ‘where’sthe camera?’ Branson have announced the ‘Virgin Earth Challenge’ with a $25million first prize for technology ‘… which results in the removal ofanthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases so as to contribute materially tothe stability of Earth’s climate’; and there’s the Live Earth concerts, part of‘Save Our Selves [‘SOS’, see] – The Campaign for a Climate in Crisis’, held inChina, Australia, South Africa, England, Brazil, Japan, United States andAntarctica. The official companion publication to the Live Earth charade was theLive Earth Global Warming Survival Handbook … written by David Mayer deRothschild, son of the notorious Sir Evelyn de Rothschild. Gore told his Oscaraudience that the ‘climate crisis’ was not a political issue, but a moral one.Bullshit, Mr Gore, it’s an enormous con and you know it. Gore has been exposedmany times as having a very large ‘carbon footprint’ and he arrived in London inMarch 2007 with a fleet of limousines to lecture the world on climate change.According to the London Mail on Sunday, he used this cavalcade of carbon totravel between two meetings 400 yards apart. He’s a fraud, the whole carbonnonsense is a fraud, and it is being employed to fleece the people with moretaxation, impose more Orwellian controls and stop the poorest people on theplanet from developing through technologies that the rich world enjoys. For theReptilian hybrids of the Illuminati networks, global warming is perfect forjustifying everything they want and it is challenging 9/11 as the mainjustification for the fascist agenda. Aurelio Peccei, a founder of the Reptilianhybrid Club of Rome, part of the Round Table network, said in the organisation’s1991 publication, The First Global Revolution:> In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that> pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like> would fit the bill … All of these are caused by human intervention … The real> enemy, then, is humanity itself. A Satanist who ‘cares’Deep breath and reality check. We are dealing with the same Al Gore who was USVice- President in the Clinton administration, one of the most corrupt inAmerican history. The Clintons’ body count is staggering with anyone whothreatened to expose their drug-running and financial scandals taken out. VinceFoster was the most famous Clinton-connected murder, but there have been so manyothers as we’ve seen and Gore was in the White House at the time. If Gore wasthe honest and decent man that he portrays himself to be, the Clintons would nothave let him past the guards on the gate, let alone into their satanic lair. TheClintons chose Gore, or had him chosen for them, because he was corrupt and aloyal member of the bloodline cabal. Gore is a cousin of former PresidentRichard Nixon and a descendant of England’s Edward I with direct links to theHoly Roman Empire through Emperors Louis II, Charles II and Louis I. Theseconnections make him a descendant of Charlemagne and a cousin of George W. Bush.He attends the rituals at Bohemian Grove and Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, theunofficial son of Baron Philippe de Rothschild, said of him:> President Clinton has ‘full blown’ multiple personality disorder and is an> active sorcerer in the satanic mystery religions. This is true of Al Gore, as> well; I have known Misters Clinton and Gore from our childhood as active and> effective Satanists. This is the guy who wants to protect us all from global warming? Gore concededwith hardly a fuss when he was denied the presidency of the United States in ablatantly fixed election in 2000. Not only was the vote rigged, so was theaftermath. Gore walked because that’s what he was told to do. His masters hadother things in mind for him, like selling the official version of globalwarming. It is often stressed that Gore was concerned about climate change fromthe 1970s, but these things are not ad-libbed by the year or month. They areplanned decades in advance and more. Gore was selected to be the front man forglobal warming long ago.Song sheet ‘science’Everything came together when his 2006 documentary was followed by the report ofa United Nations group called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) which told us that global warming is caused by human carbon emissions andwe should not entertain any other possibility. Since the day it was published inFebruary 2007, amid massive media hype, it has become the accepted truth thatthe official story of pollution-caused global warming is undeniable. AchimSteiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, saidthe findings marked an ‘historical landmark’ in the debate over whether humanswere affecting the state of the atmosphere. ‘It is an unequivocal series ofevidence [showing that] fossil fuel burning and land use changes are affectingthe climate on our planet’, he said. Despite the big-sell about the ‘world’s topscientists’, the IPCC is not a scientific organisation that does its ownresearch into climate change. It is a political body that ‘assesses’ theevidence in published reports and has its own political agenda. The UnitedNations was created by the Reptilian hybrids as a stepping stone to worldgovernment and anything that comes out of there has to be looked at veryclosely. The UN was manipulated into being by groups like the Council on ForeignRelations and even the land on which its headquarters stands today was donatedby the Rockefellers. Add Al Gore to the UN and you have a combustible mixturewhen it comes to the truth. The President of Czechoslovakia, Václav Klaus, was arare voice of sanity in the wake of the IPCC ‘report’. He said:> IPCC is not a scientific institution: it’s a political body, a sort of> non-government organization of green flavour. It’s neither a forum of neutral> scientists nor a balanced group of scientists. These people are politicised> scientists who arrive there with a one-sided opinion and a one-sided> assignment. Christopher Landsea, Science and Operations Officer at the US National HurricaneCenter, resigned from the IPCC in protest at the very bias and imbalance thatKlaus describes. Landsea said: ‘I personally cannot in good faith continue tocontribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by preconceivedagendas and being scientifically unsound’. Professor Paul Reiter of theDepartment of Entomology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who served on theIPCC and also resigned, said the claim that it consists of the world’s top 2,500scientists does not stand up to scrutiny: ‘… You look at the bibliographies ofthose people and it’s simply not true. There are quite a number ofnon-scientists’. Professor Richard Lindzen*, from the IPCC and MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (MIT), said that to get the number up to 2,500 they hadto include reviewers and government people and ‘anyone who came close to them’.Significantly, he adds that none of the scientists were asked to agree with theconclusions of the report and many of them actually disagreed. ‘People havedecided you have to convince other people that, as no scientist disagrees, thatyou shouldn’t disagree either’, he said. This is the ‘science’ on whichfantastic changes are being planned to reduce carbon emissions to ‘save theplanet’ when carbon emissions are not the cause of global warming. ProfessorPaul Reiter, one of the world’s most renowned authorities on tropical diseases,gave an example of the bias and inaccuracies in the IPCC report. It said thattropical diseases, such as malaria, were likely to spread to colder regions witheven a mild increase in temperature because of the movement of insects.‘Mosquito species that transmit malaria do not normally survive where the meanwinter temperature drops below 16-18 degrees Centigrade’, the ‘unquestionable’report said. Professor Reiter points out that mosquitoes thrive in very coldtemperatures and are extremely abundant in the Arctic. There are thirteenmillion cases a year of malaria in Russia and up to the Arctic Circle. He saidhe was ‘horrified to read the second and third assessment reports because therewas so much misinformation … virtually without mention of the scientificliterature, the truly scientific literature … by specialists in those fields’.When he resigned and demanded that his name be removed from the list ofcontributors, he had to threaten legal action before they would do so:> I think this happens a lot, those people who are specialists, but don’t agree> with the polemic and resign, and there have been a number that I know of, they> are simply put on the author list and become part of this 2,500 of the world’s> top scientists. Professor Frederick Seitz, former president of America’s National Academy ofSciences, revealed in a letter to The Wall Street Journal that the IPCC hadcensored the comments of scientists with fifteen key sections of the sciencechapter deleted because it didn’t support the political agenda to equate climatechange with carbon emissions. Professor Seitz said: ‘… this report is not whatit appears to be – it is not the version that was approved by contributingscientists listed on the title page’. Two of the deleted sections said:> None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute> the observed [climate] changes to the specific cause of increases in> greenhouse gases. > No study to date has positively attributed all or part of the [climate changes> observed to date] to anthropogenic [man-made] causes. Professor Seitz said he had ‘never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of thepeer review process than the events that led to this IPCC report’. The Panelauthors admitted that the deletions had been made and said it had been done inresponse to ‘comments from governments, individual scientists andnon-governmental organisations’. In other words, it is a political, notscientific, document from what is a political, not scientific organisation. TheIPCC report is simply a document compiled to support a pre-agreed outcome andhyped by the spinners to emphasise what they want the people to believe.Professor John Christy, who is named as a lead author of the report, said itwasn’t true that there was consensus among thousands of scientists that humansare causing a catastrophic change to the climate system. ‘I am one scientist andthere are many who think that is not true’, he said. Professor Philip Scott fromthe Department of Biogeography at the University of London continued the theme:‘The IPCC like any UN body is political. The final conclusions are politicallydriven’.Spurning the hereticsAnother tell-tale sign of an Illuminati fast one is when those challenging thelie are targeted for character assassination and hostility merely for having adifferent view. We now have the latest Orwellian label for those who don’tbelieve in the climate change fairytale: ‘Global warming denier’. This isbecoming akin to the other catch-all condemnation of people who questionofficial history, or even 9/11: ‘Holocaust denier’. Those who publicly doubt theevidence of carbon-caused climate change are shouted down by the brain-dead whohave bought the official story without a second’s thought, and mediainterviewers belligerently attack anyone who wants a more open-minded debate onthe subject – ‘He is questioning the orthodoxy, questioning the existence of the“god” we have been programmed to believe in. Seize him! Condemn him!’ What wehave here is another Problem-Reaction-Solution. They are winding up the fearfactor to terrify people into accepting ‘carbon taxation’ and other taxes andfreedom-busting change to ‘fight global warming’ (see also fighting terrorism,fighting for peace, ad infinitum). We are told to continually check our ‘carbonfootprint’ and the chattering classes appear to speak of little else as I write.Richard Lindzen, Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, was bang on when he said:> We are shifting away from science and into the realm of religious fanaticism,> where the followers of the creed, brimming with self-righteous fury, believe> that they are in possession of a higher truth … And just as in many religions,> the route to personal salvation lies in the performance of superstitious> rituals such as changing a lightbulb or arranging for a tree to be planted> after every plane journey. Of course, pollution from cars, planes and factories is not a good thing and itwould be great if there was less of it to breathe, but that is not the pointhere. We need to ask if it is affecting global temperature, because that’s theexcuse being used to take more of our income and impose draconian curbs onfreedom. I hear it said by the terminally naïve that the oil and powercorporations are also saying there is not enough evidence, and so anyone whosays the same must by definition be supporting them. The force behind thegovernments and Al Gore also controls the transnational corporations and, in theend, all the money goes into the same pot, whether it be reaped frommanipulating governments or manipulating corporations. It’s all a game, a moviethat portrays different ‘sides’ when, at the top of the pyramid, there is onlyone. Global warming is their latest mega scam after the ‘Cold War’, the ‘war onterror’, and all the rest. So what’s really going on with rising temperatures?Some scientific sanityImage [../Images/00259.jpg]Figure 250: The Medieval Warm Period when it was warmer than today and theLittle Ice Age from which the significance of today’s temperatures is oftenmeasured We are told that the Earth is now warmer than at any time since records began.That may be true, but when did the records start? A BBC report in early 2007said the year was predicted to be the ‘warmest since records began’ … in 1914.Other global records apparently go back to … 1860. What the hell does that tellus when the planetary cycles can be measured in hundreds, thousands, tens ofthousands, even millions of years? A study by a team at Harvard University ofsome 240 scientific reports showed that today’s temperatures are far from thehighest in the last thousand years and nor are we experiencing the most extremeweather patterns. The team studied data on what are called ‘temperatureproxies’, like tree rings, ice cores and historical accounts, and their findingswere published in the journal, Energy and Environment. They found there had beena Medieval Warm Period between the 9th and 14th centuries when globaltemperatures were significantly higher than today. Did they ever tell you aboutthose medieval power stations and motor cars? Maybe it was the turbo-chargedhand carts that caused it, or flatulent horses. There was also the Bronze Ageperiod 9,000 years ago, known as the Holocene Maximum, when temperatures weresome three degrees warmer than today for millennia. How was that ‘man-made’?Forests flourished in North America and elsewhere and there was no globalcatastrophe, just as there wasn’t with the Medieval Warm Period. The Harvardstudy also confirms that there was a ‘Little Ice Age’ about 700 years ago whenthere was a dramatic cooling before temperatures rose again (Figure 250). Maybea Medieval Al Gore stepped in for a while, closed down the factories and goteveryone to use public transport. During the Little Ice Age that started in the15th century, the River Thames would freeze over to such an extent that ‘IceFairs’ were held on the surface and we still see depictions of this period onsome Christmas cards. The Earth’s climate is always changing and there are timeswhen it is warmer or cooler. To compare today’s temperatures with the time ofthe Little Ice Age, as many reports do, also exaggerates the significance ofwhat is happening now. The Harvard team said their evidence shows that thebelief in the ‘unprecedented’ temperatures of today is merely the result ofstudying temperature fluctuations over too short a time. Professor Philip Scottof the Department of Biogeography at the University of London points out:> It’s important people know that climate enabled a quite different lifestyle in> the medieval period. We have this view today that warming is going to have> apocalyptic outcomes. In fact, wherever you describe this warm period it> appears to be associated with riches … > … What has been forgotten in all the discussion about global warming is a> proper sense of history. During the Medieval Warm Period, the world was warmer> even than today, and history shows that it was a wonderful period of plenty> for everyone. When the temperature started to drop [in the Little Ice Age],> harvests failed and England’s vine industry died. It makes one wonder why> there is so much fear of warmth. Because it’s a con, professor. The Earth is subject to endless energy cyclesthat affect the temperature and weather and the easiest ones to see are winter,spring, summer and autumn, or fall, as the tilt in the Earth’s axis causes thetwo hemispheres to receive either more or less solar energy through the year.What happens as we pass through the seasons? The temperature changes. In placeslike the frozen lands of Canada, they have what they call the ‘meltdown’ whenthe rising temperatures of spring and summer melt the ice before the fall andwinter comes to create it again. These seasons are only smaller cycles withinbigger and bigger cycles, and these bigger cycles ebb and flow the meantemperature by increasing, or reducing, the power of the Sun’s energy. We seethis in the warming and cooling periods of history. The bigger cycles are likelonger versions of our seasons, that’s all, and we are now in a warming periodthat will bring weather changes. The computer models of the Carbon Cult can’tpredict what will happen, because they are based on carbon emissions being thecause. As they say about computers – garbage in, garbage out.It’s the Sun, stupidI have written in some of my books about changes happening in the Sun and astudy by Swiss and German scientists is just one of many that point to climatechange being caused by increasing solar radiation. Dr Sami Solanki, director ofthe Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen, Germany, said:> The Sun has been at its strongest over the past sixty years and may now be> affecting global temperatures. The Sun is in a changed state. It is brighter> than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively> recently – in the last 100 to 150 years. Image [../Images/00260.jpg]Figure 251: The fantastic projections of energy from the Sun known as‘sunspots’. When solar energy increases, measured by sunspot activity, theEarth’s temperature rises. That is exactly what is happening with global warming Ahh, so the temperature is getting warmer because the Sun is getting stronger?Mmmm, do you think that might be possible – the Sun affecting globaltemperature? I have noticed throughout my life that the Sun definitely makes adifference when it comes to making things warmer, so I think they could be on tosomething. But how will they convince the carbon cultists that a stronger Sunmeans the temperature goes up? Will it be too complex for them to grasp? Or notcomplex enough for them to believe the answer is so simple? Dr Solanki said theyfound that when there were fewer explosive emissions from the Sun, what areknown as sunspots, there was a cooler period on Earth and vice-versa. Over thelast century, the number of sunspots has been increasing and so, therefore, hasthe temperature. Sunspots are phenomena of the Sun’s magnetic field and they areenormous (Figure 251). They can be the size of the Earth and sometimes evenJupiter and their number confirms higher or lower solar activity. This isdelivered into our atmosphere by what is called the solar wind. Dr Solanki’sresearch into sunspots and temperature was reported in the London DailyTelegraph:> They found that a dearth of sunspots signalled a cold period – which could> last up to fifty years – but that over the past century their numbers had> increased as the Earth’s climate grew steadily warmer. The scientists also> compared data from ice samples collected during an expedition to Greenland in> 1991. > The most recent samples contained the lowest recorded levels of beryllium 10> for more than 1,000 years. Beryllium 10 is a particle created by cosmic rays> that decrease in the Earth’s atmosphere as the magnetic energy from the Sun> increases. Scientists can currently trace beryllium 10 levels back 1,150> years. When the Sun is stimulated vibrationally to produce more intense radiation, weenter a warm cycle and that’s what global warming is – a changing solar energycycle. My own feeling is that suns are actually interdimensional gatewaysthrough which energies can be channelled from another dimension into this one.When they are, we are affected not only in terms of rising or fallingtemperature, but also by the consciousness they infuse into five-sense reality.This could well be one origin for the worship of the Sun by those high initiateswho understood what the Sun really is. National Geographic News reported shortlyafter the IPCC’s propaganda document was published in 2007 that Mars was alsoexperiencing warmer temperatures, just like the Earth. The same has been foundwith other planets. What could possibly cause warming on Mars and other planetsat the same time? What is common to all of them? Er … how about the Sun?Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg’s PulkovoAstronomical Observatory in Russia, stated the obvious when he said the Marsdata is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused bychanges in the Sun. ‘The long-term increase in solar irradiance is heating boththe Earth and Mars’, he said. The scientific establishment can’t see theobvious, because it is heresy against the new religion. Colin Wilson, aplanetary physicist at Oxford University, said that Abdussamatov’s explanations‘… contradict the extensive evidence presented in the most recent IPCC report’.This is the same reaction you would get from a committed religious fanatic whocannot accept anything, no matter how clear, if it contradicts what is in theBible or Koran. The IPCC report is the Holy Book of the new religion and it mustnot be contradicted. Wilson added that Abdussamatov’s views were ‘completely atodds with the mainstream scientific opinion’. We have seen already that this isnot true and, even if it was, ‘mainstream scientific opinion’ has a lamentablehistory of turning out to be wrong. What is really at odds with Abdussamatov’sviews is the version of scientific opinion included in the IPCC report, asbrilliantly exposed in 2007 by a UK Channel 4 television documentary called TheGreat Global Warming Swindle. It was a rare example of journalistic excellenceand showed what a different world we would live in if at least 90 per cent of‘journalists’ were not unworthy of the title. The programme gave a platform toscientists, many of them involved with the IPCC, who know that the belief inhuman-caused climate change does not stand up.In 1893, the British astronomer, Edward Maunder, observed that there were barelyany sunspots visible on the Sun and this became known as the Maunder Minimum. Itcorresponded with a very cold period and the graphs are blatant confirmation ofthe direct link between sunspot activity to Earth temperature (Figure 252,overleaf). The Danish Meteorological Institute began a study in 1991 toinvestigate the connection between sunspots and temperature and they found anincredibly close correlation. Professor Eigil Friis-Christensen at the DanishNational Space Centre said they went back through 400 years of astronomicalrecords and found the same story. It was the Sun, not carbon dioxide, or CO2,that was driving changes in climate. The solar physicist, Piers Corbyn, invented(or reinvented) a technique of long-range weather forecasting after studyingsunspots and seeing the effect on weather patterns. He made money month aftermonth by betting his forecasts, based on sunspots, against those of the officialLondon Meteorological Office. ‘The Sun is driving climate change, CO2 isirrelevant’, he said. It is not just greater heat from the Sun that causes allthe subsequent warming; it is also the effect of solar radiation on otherweather systems. The Earth is bombarded by particles called cosmic rays and theycombine with water vapour to form water droplets and clouds. The stronger thesolar radiation, visible as sunspots, the fewer particles get through to theEarth and so the fewer clouds are created. With fewer clouds, more solar heatgets through. Geological studies of cosmic ray and temperature records goingback six million years have shown that when solar radiation diminished, allowingmore cloud-forming cosmic rays to reach the Earth, the temperature dropped. Whensolar radiation increased, the opposite happened, not here and there or now andthen – every time (Figure 253). Professor Ian Clark of the Department of EarthSciences, University of Ottawa, said he had ‘never seen such vastly differentrecords coming together so beautifully to show really what was happening overthat long period of time’. The Sun governs the Earth’s climate by direct solarradiation and by affecting the cosmic rays that form clouds.Image [../Images/00261.jpg]Figure 252: The graph of sunspot activity to Earth temperature over hundreds ofyears. The two go up and down together Image [../Images/00262.jpg]Figure 253: The connection between cosmic rays and cloud cover is blatantlyobvious from this chart. When cosmic rays decrease, so does cloud cover. Whatmakes cosmic rays decrease? Increased sunspot activity and solar radiation Professor Nir Shaviv from the Institute of Physics at the University ofJerusalem went along with the global warming orthodoxy until he began to do hisown research. Then he saw that there were periods in Earth history when we hadthree times, even ten times, as much carbon dioxide as there is today, and ifthat did have a big effect on climate then we should see the impact in thetemperature reconstruction. However, that’s not the case. As Professor Ian Clarksaid: ‘If we look at climate from the geological timeframe we would neversuspect CO2 as a major climate driver. You can’t say that CO2 will driveclimate, it certainly never did in the past’. Dr Piers Corbyn, the ‘sunspot’weather forecaster with Weather Action, said that none of the major climatechanges in the last thousand years can be explained by CO2, and ProfessorPatrick Michaels of the Department of Environmental Sciences, University ofVirginia, was adamant: ‘Anyone who goes around and says that carbon dioxide isresponsible for most of the warming of the 20th century hasn’t looked at thebasic numbers’. The present warming trend began at least two hundred years agoas the planet began to emerge from the Little Ice Age and this was long beforecars and aircraft were invented. Since the mid-19th century the Earth’stemperature has risen by just over half a degree Celsius, but most of that risehappened before 1940 when industrial production was a fraction of what it becameafter the war. Indeed, when production exploded after 1940 the globaltemperature fell for forty years and did not begin to increase until 1975 –ironically at a time of industrial recession (Figure 254). Professor Tim Ballfrom the Department of Climatology, University of Winnipeg, said:> The temperature went up significantly up to 1940 when industrial production> was relatively low, and then in the post war years when industry and the> economies of the world really got going, and human production of CO2 just> soared, global temperature was going down. In other words, the facts did not> fit the theory. Image [../Images/00263.jpg]Figure 254: The Earth temperature-sunspot chart over more than 100 years. Anyonewith a modicum of intelligence can see that increased solar activity is thecause of global warming – not carbon dioxide In that cooling period after 1940, there were suggestions from scientists thatthe planet was going to face catastrophe because of global cooling and therewere television documentaries predicting nightmare scenarios, just as they dotoday about warming. One documentary, little more than thirty years ago, asked:‘Will a new ice age cover our lands and bury our cities?’ Carbon dioxideemissions are not causing climate change, that’s abundantly clear. It is one ofthe ‘greenhouse gases’ that trap solar heat and prevent it from leaving theEarth’s atmosphere and it’s a good thing this happens because without thegreenhouse effect the planet would be too cold to inhabit. But Professor TimBall points out that CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth’s atmosphere.In terms of changes, it is measured in tens of parts per million. Ball told TheGreat Global Warming Swindle documentary that if you take CO2 as a percentage ofall the gases in the atmosphere, oxygen, nitrogen … and so on, it’s .054 percent. ‘It’s an incredibly small portion and then you’ve got to take that portionthat humans are adding, which is the focus of all the concern, and it gets evensmaller’. CO2 is a pretty minor greenhouse gas with 95 per cent of thegreenhouse effect caused by water vapour. Carbon dioxide is a natural gasproduced by all life forms and it is what makes living things grow. Humansproduce a small fraction of the CO2 in the atmosphere and this is massivelyexceeded by volcanoes, animals, bacteria, dying vegetation like falling leaves,and by far the biggest source of carbon dioxide – the sea.Gore’s follyAl Gore’s major selling point for the official version of global warming comesfrom ice core surveys which drill deep into the ice to establish what Earthtemperatures were over hundreds of thousands of years. Gore says that for650,000 years the ice cores show the correlation between CO2 and temperature.‘When there is more carbon dioxide, the temperature gets warmer’, says Gore. Itis true that the ice cores have shown that warming and CO2 go together, but thequestion is why? Professor Ian Clark, a leading arctic paleoclimatologist, wholooks back into the Earth’s temperature record over tens of millions of years,says that there is a link between warming and CO2, but they’ve got it the wrongway round. CO2 does not cause the warming, the warming causes the CO2. Hisstudies of ice cores show that the temperature increases lead the emergence ofmore CO2 by some 800 years. ‘So obviously carbon dioxide is not the cause ofthat warming’, he points out, ‘In fact, we can say that the warming increasedthe carbon dioxide’. Clark said that clearly CO2 is a product of temperature andthus the most fundamental assumption of the official story of global warming isshown to be wrong. It appears that the 800 year time lag between risingtemperatures and carbon dioxide is because of the way the oceans work. CarlWunsch is one of the world’s leading experts in this field. He is Professor ofOceanography at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and visiting professor inOceanography at Harvard and University College, London. He’s also seniorvisiting fellow in physics and mathematics at Cambridge University and haswritten four major text books on oceanography. He said:> The ocean is the major reservoir into which carbon goes when it comes out of> the atmosphere or through which it is readmitted to the atmosphere. If you> heat the surface of the ocean it tends to emit carbon dioxide, similarly if> you cool the ocean surface the ocean can dissolve more carbon dioxide. The time lag is caused by the sheer size and depths of the oceans which takehundreds of years to transfer heat into the release of CO2. Wunsch continues:> The ocean has a memory of past events running out as far as 10,000 years. So,> for example, if someone says I am seeing changes in the North Atlantic this> must mean the climate system is changing, it might only mean that something> happened in a remote part of the ocean decades or hundreds of years ago whose> affects are now beginning to show up in the North Atlantic. Around 800 years ago was the Medieval Warm Period and so you would expect arelease of carbon dioxide from the oceans about now according to pastexperience. One other thing: if carbon dioxide is the culprit for climate changethere should be more warming in that part of the atmosphere known as theTroposphere than there is on the surface. The maximum warming should be about 10kilometres from the surface, but this is not what is happening. The bulk of theatmosphere is not warming as much as the surface and as one scientist put it:‘That’s a real head scratcher for us’.A lie is bornThe transformation from fears of a new Ice Age to fears of catastrophe caused byrising temperatures happened in a ridiculously short time in the 1970s and ‘80s.It was fuelled, as with most ‘scientific research’, by he who pays the pipercalling the tune. Mainstream ‘science’ is overwhelmingly driven by money and notan open-minded search for truth. If someone is willing to throw enormous sums atresearch to prove that temperature rises are caused by carbon dioxide emissions,they’ll find plenty of ‘scientists’ willing to stick out their hands and givethe customers what they want. Government money was rewarded with the findings itdemanded about CO2 and this spawned a whole industry of scientists, universitydepartments, ‘environmental journalists’ and administrators who now owe theirliving to a larger extent, often completely, to the dyke holding on carbondioxide = global warming. It seems that when Margaret Thatcher was British PrimeMinister in the 1980s she pushed global warming as a way of undermining the coalmining industry she so despised, and to justify her desire for more nuclearpower. Her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, was the first politicianto fund global warming research, but later after serving on a House of Lordsinquiry into climate change he became one of the most outspoken politicalcritics of the official story. ‘It simply doesn’t add up’, he said. Thatcherapparently told the Royal Society, the Freemason-created bastion of mainstreamscience, that the money was available for them to prove the global warmingtheory with regard to CO2. The floodgates did open. While Margaret Thatcher mayhave been one of the vehicles to get things moving, the real orchestration wascoming, as usual, behind the scenes where the agenda is dictated that the puppetpoliticians introduce as ‘government policy’. Thatcher asked Britain’sMeteorological Office to create a climate modelling unit and this would providethe foundations for the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.Professor Philip Scott said:> They came out with the first big report that predicted climatic disaster as a> result of global warming. I remember going to the press conference and being> amazed at the total disregard of all climate science up to that time,> including the role of the Sun, which had been the subject of a major meeting> at the Royal Society just a few months earlier. As Professor Scott said, the moment politicians put their weight behindsomething and attach their name to it, money will flow. Research and developmentinstitutions began to ‘bubble up’, he recalled. ‘[They were] … going to beresearching climate, but with a particular emphasis on the relationship betweencarbon dioxide and temperature’. Nigel Calder, former editor of New Scientistmagazine, said that, after 1990, if he wanted to apply for a research grant forthe study of squirrels, for example, he would say that he wished to investigatethe nut gathering behaviour of squirrels with special reference to the effectsof global warming. That way he would get his money, but if he forgot to mentionglobal warming he likely would not. Professor Richard Lindzen at the MIT saidthat funding for climate and climate-related sciences was around $170 million ayear, ‘which was reasonable for the size of the field’. But, from the presidencyof Father Bush, it leaped to $2 billion and people who were not otherwiseinterested in climate research moved in to follow the dosh. Are these people whodepend for their funding on carbon dioxide causing global warming going to findthat, in fact, it is a solar cycle? No way. Neither are the environmentalists orthe media who can sell subscriptions, political ideologies, newspapers anddocumentaries by more and more sensational statements and ‘reporting’.Computer craziesThe whole hysteria is generated from computer models of climate change which arepredicting future outcomes based on thoroughly inaccurate data. Dr Roy Spencer,Weather Satellite Team Leader at NASA, said that climate models are only as goodas the assumptions that go into them and they have hundreds of assumptions. Allit took, he said, was for one assumption to be wrong for the forecast to be wayoff. The most important assumption in all of them is that carbon dioxide causesglobal warming. Professor Tim Ball put it this way:> The analogy I use is that my car is not running very well, so I’m going to> ignore the engine, which is the Sun, and I am going to ignore the> transmission, which is water vapour, and I am going to look at one nut on the> right rear wheel, which is the human-produced CO2. The science is that bad. > If you haven’t understood the climate system, all the components, the cosmic> rays, the solar, the CO2, the water vapour, the clouds and put it all> together, then your model isn’t worth anything. You can make the models predict whatever you like if you type in appropriatedata and we are having models assessing the effect of a one per cent a yearincrease in CO2 when it has been .49 per cent for ten years and .42 and .43 forthe two ten year periods before that. Professor Patrick Michaels at theUniversity of Virginia says that with twice as much greenhouse radiation goinginto the computer than is known to be happening, ‘It shouldn’t shock you thatthey are predicting more warming than is occurring’. The models tell us that sealevels will rise as the ice shelves melt at the poles, but Professor JohnChristy, climatologist at the University of Alabama and director of the EarthSystem Science Center, says they have temperature records for Greenland that goback thousands of years, and when it was much warmer than today there was nodramatic melting of ice. In the summer of 2007, the oldest plant DNA yetrecovered was found more than a mile inside a Greenland glacier. It showed thathundreds of thousands of years ago the planet was far warmer than previouslybelieved, but even when the average temperature was five degrees celcius higherthan today the Greenland glaciers did not completely melt away. ProfessorSyun-Ichi Akasofu, Director of International Arctic Research Centre, says thatover time the ice caps are always expanding and contracting. ‘I see all the TVprogrammes that … show big chunks of ice falling from the edge of the glaciers,but people forget that ice is always moving’, he said. ‘They ask me, “did yousee ice falling from the edge of glaciers?” [I say] …Yes, that’s the springbreak up, happens every year’. He said the media came to him all the timelooking for something from the ‘greenhouse disaster’, but he tells them ‘Thereis none’. Professor Philip Scott said that the permafrost in Russia melted to afar greater extent seven or eight thousand years ago, ‘but the world didn’t cometo a crunching halt because of it’. He also says that global sea level changesare governed by thermal expansion of the oceans, nothing to do with melting ofice, and this is ‘an enormously slow and long process’.The Carbon InquisitionCommon sense has no say in the global warming ‘debate’ and anyone who refuses toaccept the ludicrous religious orthodoxy is attacked, dismissed or vilified.Professor Tim Ball said: ‘It gets very difficult and very nasty and verypersonal – there have been death threats and all sorts of things, so I’m notdoing it for my health’. Roy Spencer at NASA says that it is generally harder toget research proposals funded when you question the cause of global warming and‘you’ll find very few of us willing to take a public stand because it does cutinto research funding’. In so many ways the whole climate change scenario is amaster class in how the Reptilian hybrid manipulation works. You decide on whatyou want the people to believe; you fund those who will support your officialstory; and you make life extremely uncomfortable and financially challenging foranyone who exposes the lie. They have done this across a vast range of subjects,as we have seen in this book.Now we have the Global Warming Cult in full cry, the new religion, newinquisition, in pursuit of the heretics. It is an alliance of far rightpoliticians, who have been responsible for mass slaughter all over the world,the Robot Radical left and their allies in the Robot Radical Greens, most ofacademia and the mainstream media. This is the same grouping that opposes anyidea that the official story of 9/11 is a fairytale. All agree on moreregulation, more controls and more taxation to ‘save the world’ from somethingthat does not even begin to threaten its existence. The night after The GreatGlobal Warming Swindle had demolished the lie of carbon-caused climate change onnational television, I saw Caroline Lucas, one of the UK’s Green MEPs in theirrelevant European Parliament, interviewed on the BBC current affairs show,Newsnight. Had she watched the documentary? Had it even registered in herprogrammed reality? It seemed not. Off she went, all carbon-neutralguns-a-blazing. Draconian and insanely extreme anti-CO2 policies unveiled thatday by Tony Blair were ‘not enough’, Ms Lucas informed us. (The term ‘It’s notenough’ is the catch-phrase of everyone in political opposition when agovernment does something they agree with.) There was no doubt in Ms Lucas’sfevered mind. Global warming was a ‘national emergency’ and a ‘national securityissue’, she insisted. More recycled garbage. There’s nothing you can do aboutincreased solar energy, so sensible people would look at what we need to do tomitigate the downside of that and take advantage of the many good things it willbring. Instead, all focus and energy is going into chasing Al Gore in his whiterabbit costume. A few nights after I saw Ms Lucas, someone questioned theofficial story on a television debate programme. The former Blair governmentminister, Claire Short, responded that the ‘world-leading scientists’ on theIPCC had agreed that it was true and that was, therefore, what she believed.David Adam, Environment Correspondent of the Robot Radical London Guardian,ridiculed The Great Global Warming Swindle while telling us that he had not evenwatched it. As his Guardian colleague, George ‘I believe the 9/11 fantasy’Monbiot, posts on his website: ‘Tell people something they know already and theywill thank you for it. Tell them something new and they will hate you for it’.None of these people want to hear the truth because the lie suits them better.Professor Frederick Singer, former Director of the US National Weather SatelliteService, says that no matter what evidence is produced to expose the nonsense ofcarbon-caused global warming, the myths would continue to influence publicperception:> There will still be people who believe that this is the end of the world,> particularly when you have, for example, the chief scientist of the UK telling> people that by the end of the century the only habitable place on the Earth> will be the Antarctic. And humanity may survive thanks to some breeding> couples who move to Antarctic. It's hilarious. It would be hilarious,> actually, if it weren't so sad. The shrill voices of the global warmers of the Carbon Cult are bound to becomeever more hysterical and extreme in a bid to attract more converts, and therepeaters in government, industry, 'education' and science will flow with thedough and perpetuate the lie. One conference on climate change in Nairobi wasattended by six thousand expenses-paid delegates and among the topics fordiscussion was 'global warming and sexism'. I think I will apply for a researchgrant to explore the connection between global warming and pains in the arse.The sad thing is that I would probably get it. Meanwhile, the poorest people onthe planet are told they cannot have the basic services of the rich nations, orexploit their natural resources because of the dangers from carbon dioxide.Sorry guys, we're pulling the ladder up now, but don't worry we're planninganother concert for you next year and Madonna's promised to play. Great, eh? Howarrogant and stupid it all is, but then I guess that people living on less thana dollar a day can always buy their carbon offsets from A1 Gore.The world is bloody crazy.PostscriptAs I add this postscript in November 2008, global temperatures are fallingbecause the sunspot cycle is in a down-phase. Yet the purveyors of the officiallie are claiming that falling temperatures and even record snowfalls are proofof global warming!Also, some 650 scientists challenging the alleged ‘consensus’ that ‘climatechange’ is caused by human-generated carbon emissions were featured in a 2008 USSenate Minority report. By contrast only 52 scientists, together with diplomatsand political representatives, were behind the 2007 IPCC Summary forPolicymakers which has become the Bible of the Global Warming Cult that says‘the debate is over’.> > > > *Professor Richard Lindzen has been linked to oil interests and it is claimed> that this discredits what he says.

The most important chapters in this book,however, are the first two and this one. Crucial to the collective enslavementhas been the mass hypnosis that has led humanity to see itself as ‘little me’when we are all that has ever, does and will ever exist. Indeed, ‘has’, ‘does’and ‘will’ are all unfolding in the same NOW and we are that NOW. As anear-death experiencer said:> … everything from the beginning, my birth, my ancestors, my children, my wife,> everything comes together simultaneously. I saw everything about me, and about> everyone who was around me. I saw everything they were thinking now, what they> thought then, what was happening before, what was happening now.

From that perspective everything is possible – yes, even sorting out the mess wehave allowed to be created in this reality. Indeed, the mess is being sorted,although it may not seem so. When I first began to consciously ‘wake up’ amidsome extraordinary experiences in 1990 and ’91 (see Tales from the Time Loop), amajor theme in my life was of a coming transformation of human perception. Theredidn’t appear to be any sign of this at the time, but, as I travelled and metpeople we would call ‘psychics’, I was told on many occasions that I wasdestined to play a role in the coming global awakening when humanity would breakfree from the amnesia that has held us in servitude. I put all this aside tosimmer while I got on with my life and I figured that if it was true theevidence would eventually be there to support it. Deep down, though, I just knewit was true, despite all the indications to the contrary. Today, it is clearthat something is a stirring. When I began my journey to uncover and communicatethe hidden truths there was mass ridicule and condemnation from mainstreamsociety and only the few already switching on showed any interest. Thiscontinued pretty much until the last years of the 1990s when I saw minds andhearts beginning to open at a gathering speed. The transformation, theawakening, whatever name you wish to use, is upon us. It may not seem like thatwith all the conflict, control and the still closed-minded majority; but it ishappening all over the world.Message from beyondIt is right to be careful about psychic or ‘channelled’ communications becausemuch of it is tosh for many reasons. Some of the ‘channels’ are getting‘information’ from their own psyche, not other dimensions, or higherconsciousness, and what they say is constructed to fit their own beliefs. Somemay be connecting with awareness beyond this reality, but there are manyentities in other realms that use ‘channels’ to manipulate and mislead. You canoften have a psychic or channel who is excellent one day and poor the next. Eventhe same ‘channelling’ can go through periods of strong connection and weak, abit like using a mobile phone. When your phone is ‘breaking up’ you get garbledinformation and it is the same with channelling. Every now and then, however,comes something that feels profoundly right and stands the test of what we call‘time’. So it was with a communication given to me through a ‘channel’, or‘sensitive’, in 1990. The main difference between a psychic and a channel isthat the psychic is picking up communications through the mind in a way that’slike having a conversation with other realms. You’ll hear them say ‘Can you giveme that again?’ and ‘He’s saying this or that …’ A channel is taken over byanother-dimensional awareness that speaks directly through his or herbody-computer. The channel’s role is not to communicate, but to withdraw fromthe conscious state to allow another awareness free access. The same principleis used malevolently by the other-dimensional Reptilians to dictate thebehaviour of their Reptilian hybrids. When the ‘take-over’ is powerful enough, achannel’s facial features and voice can change and that happened with thiscommunication in 1990 about the transformation of human perception. Thecommunicator gave the name ‘Magnu’, but, as with Chuck Jones or Ethel Bloggs,the name is not important. It is the message that matters. ‘Magnu’ said throughthe channel that he had a connection with this reality in the ‘Atlantean period’when, as I outlined earlier, fantastic upheavals appear to have taken place.This is the ‘channelling’ in full:> I feel you are sensing now the energies coming in, the energies surrounding> your planet. This is causing many of you to ask questions. It is causing many> of you to re-evaluate completely your way of life, where you feel you wish to> go, what you want to do.

This is the context from which I am coming. > There came a time when this knowledge and the energies were withdrawn.

It has acted in other times like a fail-safe device. In order to> activate these chakric points upon your planet, the energies must all pass> through the central point. They must pass through the heart of the pattern. This is why the British Isles has always been so important to the Reptilianhybrids and it is also the reason there are more standing stones and circles persquare mile in Britain than anywhere else in the world. They are quartz crystaltransmitter-receivers placed at the heart of the planet’s energy grid, or‘motherboard’. What ‘Magnu’ said in 1990 is what is happening today with the‘awakening’, or the ‘Shift’, as some people call it.Knowledge is dangerous in the wrong mind in the sense that cleverness withoutwisdom is a most destructive combination, and so when the Reptilian challengecame the energies containing that higher knowledge were withdrawn, as ‘Magnu’said. It was not only that the vibrational field became denser as thefrequencies fell; the power of the frequencies themselves also became weaker. Itwas like having a strong reception on the radio one minute and then hearing onlya faint voice that comes and goes. This is what happened to end the ‘Golden Age’and plunge this reality into ignorance – the ‘Fall of Man’. It was the knowledgeand potential, the awareness, contained in those withdrawn energies that allowedthe astonishing ancient structures to be built that are unexplainable byconventional history. The colossal energetic change was possibly connected tothe fantastic geological catastrophe that we know as the ‘Great Flood’, andafterwards life became a shadow of what it had been like before. This realitybecame a vibrational prison with its inhabitants trapped in the illusion ofdensity while the Reptilian hybrids had access to a higher intellectual (notspiritual) knowledge through their connection to their Reptilian masters inanother vibrational realm. Those who carried the knowledge, or were able toraise their consciousness to access it beyond this reality, have been targetedever since by the Reptilian hybrids and the ‘Holy’ Inquisitions are only oneexample. They wanted to have a monopoly on the higher knowledge of how tomanipulate the illusion and its energetic/mathematical construct while keepingthe human population in ignorance of it.The Reptilians and their leading hybrids have been aware that the energies andthe knowledge were going to return and would bring with them the awakening fromthe collective amnesia that has made humanity so easy to control. With theseenergies would follow the awareness, the recovering memory, of what is reallygoing on and who and what we really are – Infinite Love, Infinite Genius. Thedesperate race to impose total control with the microchips, electromagnetic‘soup’, HAARP project and TETRA systems, genetically modified food, the chemicalassault through vaccines and additives, and the undermining of food supplementsand alternative methods of healing, are all part of the attempt to so disruptand control human body-computers that they will be unable to connect with, andprocess, the vibrational return of the Golden Age. Quite simply, you can have aradio in a sea of frequencies, but it will only pick up the one it is tuned to.The idea is to ensure that human body-computers only connect with the lowerdensities and not the higher knowledge that is becoming available once again.The microchip is central to this along with the ‘micro-reality’ they areattempting to create with the ‘soup’, HAARP and similar technologies, and thesatellite system. The Orwellian levels of surveillance are primarily to identifyand target those who are emerging from the amnesia, while political correctnessand ‘hate laws’ are to prevent them communicating what they know. The DNAdatabases are in place to allow access to everyone’s unique broadcast-receivercode so they can be vibrationally targeted and disrupted if they show signs oftuning to higher awareness. The plan is for every child to be microchipped atbirth to hold them in five-sense servitude from womb to cemetery. Children andyoung people are in the eye of this storm because they will be here at theheight of the ‘Shift’. The Reptilian hybrids may seem confident and in control,but they’re actually terrified that humans will wake up and see the truth –which we will if we make that choice.The ‘Armageddon’ diversionThere are many reality-traps being laid to divert people from the Shift and herdthem into the densities of fear and conflict. For example, the fear of climaticcatastrophe, together with the manipulated wars and other disasters that theyhave in the pipeline, are being used to sell the lie about the ‘End Times’.Stewart Swerdlow learned about the End Times scenario while he was in theMontauk mind control operation on Long Island, New York, and there have beenmany other sources for what is called ‘Project Blue Beam’. This is essentiallythe manipulated ‘fulfilment’ of biblical and other religious ‘prophecy’ to conthe population into accepting a ‘One World Religion’. The multiple religionshave served the Reptilians well in that they have provided a wonderfulopportunity to divide and rule at will; but, to complete their goal of acentralised global dictatorship with a world government, army, central bank andcurrency, and the end to individuality, they need to establish a one worldreligion, too. It is part of the hive mind that they want to impose. Fundamentalto this is conflict involving the biblical land of so much ‘prophecy’ – Israel.This includes, it is claimed, the destruction of the mosque at Temple Mount inJerusalem through either a ‘terrorist bombing’ or manipulated ‘earthquake’. Thebomb is the most likely, given the horrors that would follow in terms of theIslamic response and I have heard this predicted by my own sources several timesover the years. Whatever the means, the aim is to artificially complete the OldTestament prophecy about the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. This‘completing the prophecy’ deal has been used through the ages and includes theportrayal of the New Testament as a fulfilment of the Old.One of the most vocal researchers of Project Blue Beam was the French-Canadianjournalist and Christian, Serge Monast. He came to the fore with his informationin the early 1990s, but in 1995 apparently died of a ‘heart attack’, aged 46.Monast claimed, and Swerdlow agrees, that Project Blue Beam is a massive globalplan to mislead the people into following the Illuminati ‘religion’ – in factthe religion of Babylon currently being played out most notably through theRoman Catholic Church. Instead of the series of deities in circulation in thevarious religions up to this point, they want to fuse them all into one. It isclaimed that Blue Beam Project, orchestrated through NASA, will go throughseveral sequences to create the One World Religion and put what they term ‘theAntichrist’ at its head. These include:> •Fake archaeological ‘discoveries’ to discredit the beliefs of the major> religions and show they are in error.> •A massive 3D global holographic show in the sky with sound and lasers that> projects specific images to different parts of the world to fit with the major> religious beliefs of each region.

Holographic technology can project anythingas a 3D optical illusion – spacecraft, wars in the sky, angels, ‘Mother Mary’ or‘Jesus’ – and there is no doubt that such potential exists. The same goes fortechnology that can tap into brain function to make it sound like ‘God’ or‘Jesus’ or ‘Krishna’ is talking to you. This will be even easier if people aremicrochipped. Such technology is extremely advanced and even more sophisticatedmethods are still hidden in the underground bases and development projects. Itis important not to judge possibility by what we know and see; the secret stuffis decades ahead of that. I am not saying the predictions about Project BlueBeam are true, because I don’t know, but they are most certainly technologicallypossible. The theme, if not the detail, I’m sure is correct. They want tomanipulate religious beliefs to fuse into one after enormous upheaval andconflict between them. If what is claimed about Project Blue Beam is correct wewill now be aware of what is happening when it happens, and the more who knowthe less effective will be its impact. (By the way, we can also expect moregenuine UFO activity that will nail the ludicrous idea that we are ‘alone’ inthis reality. Such activity is already happening amid a massive cover up by theauthorities.)The plan to manipulate biblical and other religious prophecy is alreadyunfolding with the Christian Zionist movement increasing its influence all thetime. Christian Zionists have an unshakable belief in the ‘End Times’. Most ofthese evangelical Christians are just being duped by their leaders intosupporting Israel because it plays such a central part in the Bible and the lifeof ‘Jesus’, but those running this stage-show are well aware of what it isreally designed to do – con Christians into believing that the time of the‘Second Coming’ has arrived. This fits with the alleged Project Blue Beam. Theywant Christians to believe that the End Times predicted in the Book ofRevelation have at last arrived, and that we are in the midst of what it calls‘Armageddon’, the place of the ‘final battle’ between ‘good and evil’. No oneknows for sure where this ‘Armageddon’ is supposed to be, but the line beingsold is that it comes from the Hebrew words Har Megido or Megiddo, which mean‘Mountain of Megiddo’. The Book of Revelation says:> And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the> golden altar which is before God, one saying to the sixth angel who had the> trumpet, ‘Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates> [now Iraq]’. And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day> and month and year, were released, so that they might kill a third of mankind.> And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard> the number of them. (9:13-21) > And the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates; and> its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings of the> east. And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of> the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits> like frogs; for they were spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to> the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for war on the great day> of God, the Almighty ... And they gathered them together to the place which in> Hebrew is called Har-magedon. (16:12-16) Har Megiddo is located in northern Israel, south of Nazareth and Haifa in thearea targeted by Hezbollah rocket attacks from Lebanon in 2006. When you readand see the material being put out in the United States by the Christian-Zionistalliance, it is clear that the idea of the End Times battle between ‘good’ and‘evil’, or ‘Armageddon’, is being pedalled ever more obviously. This is not,however, the fulfilment of ancient biblical prophecy, it is the completion of aplan to mirror biblical prophecy and scam the Christian and Jewish world intobelieving that the ‘Lord’ or ‘God’ is doing what ‘He’ promised He would do. Thisis a theme of Blue Beam for sure and it is designed to divert and hide what isreally going on. Yes, there are massive upheavals, conflict and controlhappening and they are gathering pace by the day; but while it may appear tomany like the End Times of Revelation, we are actually experiencing the ChangeTimes that will sweep away this nonsense. Under the radar of the Illuminatigame-plan amazing things are happening from deep within ‘human’ consciousness.It is the time of the Great Shift, the Great Awakening, and an incredibletransformation of perception awaits those who are ready to grasp it.2012Another theme to be aware of is the gathering obsession with the year 2012. Thisis destined to become near-hysteria as that date approaches. Those who havestudied the ‘calendar’ left by the ancient Maya people in Central America saythat it charts cycles of energy and the ‘evolution’ of consciousness. The Mayaappear to have originated in the Yucatan, Mexico, about 2600 BC and they reachedtheir peak around AD 250 in what has now become southern Mexico, Guatemala,northern Belize and western Honduras. They studied astronomy, developedhieroglyphic writing and had the same beliefs and knowledge in many ways as theSumerians. The Maya, too, closely interacted with the Reptilian ‘gods’. They arebest known today for their magnificent temple-pyramids and their measurement of‘time’ and energy cycles in the ‘Mayan Calendar’. Many believe that theculmination of major energy cycles identified by the Maya will happen onDecember 21st 2012. Others, like Dr Carl Johan Calleman, the author of bookssuch as The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness, say thisdate is actually October 28th 2011. Still other estimates I have seen say thedate is February 10th 2011. Whatever it may be, it’s soon, and interestingly Ihave seen reports that the current sunspot cycle is due to peak in late 2011 ormid-2012 with warnings that this could affect communications networks andsatellites.Image [../Images/00264.jpg]Figure 255: A Mayan pyramid with its nine levels The year of 2012 is considered significant by many ancient cultures, includingthe shamans of South Africa like Credo Mutwa, and it has come up many times withregard to the timescale of the Reptilian hybrid agenda. The Maya appear to havebelieved that the Earth has been going through nine cycles, made up of ‘days’and ‘nights’ (good times and challenging times) and that each cycle containstwenty times more ‘creation’ than the last. Some believe that these nine cyclesare represented by the nine levels of Mayan pyramids (Figure 255). Dr Callemansays that ‘time’ does not pass quicker with each cycle; it only appears tobecause more and more ‘creation’ – activity – is taking place. When you lookback over the last few centuries alone you can certainly see this pattern veryclearly with the pace of change and activity accelerating at an ever fasterspeed. What would have been considered ‘miracles’ and impossibilities not solong ago are now commonplace and we have seen nothing yet. Ian Xel Lungold, whohas worked with Calleman on decoding the Mayan information, has come to similarconclusions. He says:> A very brief example; the beginning of the 5th [cycle] of Creation’s pattern> was 102,000 years ago. This is when our ancestors learned to speak.> Advancements in technology took approximately 7,900 years each. The 6th began> in 3115 BC and this is when we learned to write. Changes in technology took> place about every 396 years. The 7th started AD 1755. Here was the invention> of the mail service, the printing press, newspapers and the beginning of the> Industrial Revolution. Major tech advances were achieved every 19.7 years. The> beginning of the 8th [cycle] was Jan 5th 1999. Now we have the Internet and> instant communications world wide. The same amounts of technical advancements> now occur every 360 days. These are the Mayan cycles, according to researchers:> Cellular cycle: beginning 16.4 billion years ago; developed the consciousness> of Action/Reaction. > Mammalian cycle: beginning 820 million years ago; developed the consciousness> of Stimulus/Response. > Familial cycle: beginning 41 million years ago; developed the consciousness of> Stimulus/Individual Response. > Tribal cycle: beginning two million years ago; developed the consciousness of> Similarities/Differences. > Cultural cycle: beginning 102,000 years ago; developed the consciousness of> Reason. > National cycle: beginning in the year 3115 BC; developed the consciousness of> Law. > Planetary cycle: beginning in the year AD 1755; developed the consciousness of> Power. > Galactic cycle: beginning January 5th, 1999; developing the consciousness of> Ethics. > Universal cycle: beginning February 10th, 2011 [or in that period of> 2011/2012]; will develop the unlimited ability of ‘Conscious Co-Creation’. For me, what we are looking at here is the Matrix computer program, the TimeLoop as I call it, which goes through its programmed cycle and returns to thestart, symbolically like a DVD. I do not think, as many Maya researchers seemto, that these cycles chart the evolution of consciousness in terms of InfiniteConsciousness or Infinite Awareness. This does not need to ‘evolve’ byexperiencing the virtual reality game. I would suggest it is far more related tothe potential of consciousness to manifest itself in this realm and so influencethe program. Nor, is it all pre-ordained or dependent on some moment in 2011 or2012. I don’t buy that at all. It is a process of transformation that is gettingever-more powerful and by 2012 the Shift will be far ahead of where it is today;but I say 2012 is a ‘window’ of change, not a year, day or hour when everythingsuddenly flips. These ‘Mayan’ cycles may provide a backdrop, a ‘road map’ assome may call it, but the way we choose to go is up to us. We can be dominatedby the program and be pawns of it, or we can use consciousness to change it. Weare now in an amazing period when the program and Infinite Awareness are cominginto sync and what a ride it is going to be for those who choose to go with it.I was saying many years ago in my books that there were two main ways to reactto the energy flows that are now cascading through this reality. Taking theanalogy of a rushing river, we can enjoy the ride by relaxing and lying back onthe airbed, at one with the flow. Or, we can stand up in the water, refuse tobudge, and use more and more of our energy just to stand up and stand still.Even then, at some point the waves will be so large and powerful we will besmacked from our feet and into the energetic white-water ride.Cracking the concreteAnyone who is awakening from the program will know what happens when concretereality starts to crack. Your life changes, often ‘falls apart’, and you wonderwhy you are going through such challenges when you just want to ‘be spiritual’.All this happens for a very good reason. We are projecting a vibrational fieldthat reflects our current mental, emotional and spiritual state and this beliefsystem dictates which energy fields within All Possibility that our computerdecides to ‘read’ or ignore. The process is the same as when the man called‘Tom’ didn’t read his daughter’s energy field (and so could not see her) afterthe hypnotist implanted the belief that she wasn’t in the room. Low densitybelief systems that dominate human perception – fear, depression, division,race, religion, politics, ‘us and them’ – lead people to read only a tinyfraction of All Possibility. Fear is the most limiting of all beliefs and statesof being because it causes people to ‘freeze’ vibrationally and withdraw into adense vibrational shell. From there we ‘read’ only those fields within AllPossibility that vibrate within the density that represents fear. In this way,we attract to us what we fear and fulfil our states of depression by readingthose fields that manifest as experiences that further depress us. If youbelieve the glass is half empty, it will be. This is another reason why theReptilians and their hybrids work to keep people in a state of fear.We create our own reality on the basis of what we believe, consciously andsubconsciously. We may appear to believe something on a conscious level, butoften this is a front to hide what is going on subconsciously. We can see thiswith apparently confident people who are actually consumed by severe self-doubtjust below the conscious threshold. This reading or decoding of possibilityfields can also be expressed as what I call ‘vibrational magnetism’ in whichenergy attracts that of similar vibration. We call these energies people,places, jobs, relationships, experiences and so on. As we awaken to anotherlevel of Awareness, so the energy matrix creating what we call our ‘lives’begins to break down and change. This must, and clearly does, reflect itself inthe ‘outer’ (decoded) world of people, places, jobs, relationships andexperiences. As the inner transforms, so the ‘outer’ must follow because one isa reflection of the other. We experience this as the life we knew ‘breakingdown’, but what we are actually doing is breaking through to a new reality andtherefore a new life experience. If you always do what you’ve always done,you’ll always get what you’ve always got. We have to change what we do, orchange what we are, to change what we get. It can seem unpleasant and scary atthe time, but it’s just the old matrix coming apart so the new one can form.Something very similar is happening in the collective world now as we watch,often in horror, the breaking down of the old construct. What awaits us on theother side, however, is a world that reflects the awakened understanding thatInfinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion. We are witnessingthe collapse of the old matrix to make way for the birth, or re-birth, ofanother collective reality. The ‘Magnu’ channelling said:> So you are being asked to change. You are being asked to change in a total> way. It is not a matter of small changes, of a little thing here, a little> thing there. You are really being asked to turn yourselves inside out. It is a time of choice for everyone. One choice is to hold on to illusorybeliefs in an effort to find security in the familiar. If we do that, we will bestanding in the rushing river trying to stay upright while the water flowsfaster and faster and we get more weary, anxious and fearful. Another choice isto open our hearts and minds, get on that airbed, relax and flow where theenergy takes us; or, rather, where we take ourselves by manifesting anotherreality. The difference between these two states is the choice between followingcomputer-mind or Infinite Awareness. Put another way, the difference betweenthinking and knowing. The thinking mind is the governor of perception andbehaviour for most people. As René Descartes put it: ‘I think, therefore I am’.Well, yes you are, at the computer level of reality, if you choose to thinkrather than know. Knowing, also called ‘intuition’, is our connection toInfinite Awareness, while thought is an electrochemical phenomenon like itsfellow prison warder, emotion. The mental state is affected by emotion andvice-versa because they change the electrochemical balance of each other. Whenwe get emotional we stop thinking straight and when we get into certain patternsof thought we are affected emotionally. Think of your worst fear or your mostpleasurable experience and you will feel your emotions change. They areelectrochemically and vibrationally connected through the body-computer systemand, in the same way, they can both be fundamentally changed by electrochemicaland vibrational influences like mercury, electricity power lines, TETRA masts,food additives and so on. Knowing or intuition is a very different source ofAwareness and decision-making which bypasses thought and emotion, or at leastcan override it if we make the choice to follow intuition rather thancomputer-generated thought.Don’t think it – know itHow often in your life have you found that what you feel to do and what youthink to do are at odds with each other? You want to do something and your heart(chakra) sings at the prospect; but then your head kicks in to think you intosubmission. The body-computer is brilliant at thwarting intuition and usuallyopens its offensive with: ‘You can’t do that because …’ It wins nearly all ofthe time once it has pinned you into its reality zone. Why wouldn’t it? Theprogram has been nagging you since you were born and repetition is the mosteffective form of perception control. You understand body-computer reality and‘logic’ because you have lived it for so long. When it says that if you followyour intuition then A, B, and C will be the consequences, the subsequentanxiety, guilt and fear is normally enough to suppress your intuitive urges. ‘Iwould love to do it, but …’ is the classic payoff line before you return to the‘real’ world of material ‘responsibility’. Oh yes, we must always be‘responsible’, which usually means toeing the line. Your body-computer issupported in its quest to silence your intuition by other computers uniting toprotect their pre-eminence. We call these other laptops our friends, parents andpeople at work, and their robotic programs spew out software data like: ‘Youcan’t do that, what about your job?’; ‘You can’t do that, what about yourfamily?’; ‘You can’t do that, what will the neighbours think?’; and ‘You can’tdo that for all the reasons I can’t think of now, but give me a few days and Iwill’. You hear this from mother computers, dad computers, brother and sistercomputers, far-right computers, far-left computers, green computers, teachercomputers, doctor computers, media computers, Christian computers, Jewishcomputers, Muslim computers, Hindu computers and New Age computers. Life can belike living in a branch of PC World. The computer level of reality doesn’t wantyour perceptions to change when it has almost total control the way things are.The body-computer wants you to serve the system because it is the system. It hasbeen programmed to serve the construct. If you think about what your intuitionis telling you, the conclusion will invariably be that the computer knows best.A famous British football club manager called Brian Clough was once asked whathappened if a player disagreed with him. ‘Well’, he said, ‘we get together, talkabout it and agree that I was right’. The analogy is very appropriate. That isusually the outcome when mind is at odds with intuition.Infinite Awareness speaks to us through intuition and knowing because it is All-Knowing. It doesn’t have to think and work things out because it already knows.To think is to accept that you are not All-Knowing and this alone locks you intocomputer reality. I don’t mean that you know every detail of everything;although that is certainly possible in the highest levels of Awareness. In thisdensity we can work with other levels of knowing. To know you have to take acertain action does not require you to understand every last detail of why.Intuitive knowing is that feeling that we just know something, but we don’t knowwhy or where it has come from. You might know that you need to take a certaincourse of action or go somewhere and I would say it’s important to trust whatyou feel without letting computer-thought talk you out of it. It is not for meto tell anyone what to do. How people live their lives is none of my business solong as they don’t impose their will on others. I am just sharing my ownexperience of intuition for you to decide, or better still know, what to takeand leave. I could not possibly have compiled all the information I have andwritten all the books had I just sat down and tried to think it all out. Theinformation has come from following intuition that has led me with incrediblesynchronicity to people, books, accounts and experiences which have shown mewhat is going on. When people start to go with their intuition they suddenlyfind their lives are full of ‘coincidences’. The flow of Infinite Awareness isguiding them to whatever is necessary to fulfil their ‘destiny’ or ‘dream’. Thisdoesn’t happen on anything like the same scale at the computer level of realitywhere the perception of possibility is so limited. Its program wants to closedown intuition, not go with it. Another reason for limited synchronicity is thatdense energy does not have the same power of attraction as free-flowingAwareness and you could use the symbolism of a little magnet that attracts a fewiron filings and a colossal electromagnet that could pull a bus cross thestreet. In energetic terms, opening up to Infinite Awareness massively increasesyour power to attract what you want and the potential to ‘read’ a far greaterspectrum of possibility and bring it into ‘physical’ experience.Daydream believersThe body-computer is actually designed to open the intuitive channels to higherconsciousness, but systematic manipulation of our thoughts and perceptions oftenprevent us taking advantage of this. There is a body cycle called the ultradianrest response, or what you might call ‘Intuition Time’. More accurately, it isIntuition No- Time, because time is an illusion of five-sense reality and doesnot exist in the realms that intuition taps into. The ultradian rest response isdescribed like this by Dr Laurie Nadel in his book, Sixth Sense: Unlocking YourUltimate Mind Power:> Do you find yourself losing concentration during certain times of the day?> Perhaps it comes as a sudden touch of fatigue, or a subtle mental fuzziness.> All of a sudden, you feel droopy. Your eyes may tear. You can’t stop yawning,> or you sigh. > Maybe you find yourself staring out the window, your mind faraway from the> tasks at hand. If somebody speaks to you, you find yourself startled by the> sound of his voice. Or you don’t understand what was said the first time and> ask the speaker to repeat himself. These are all signs that the body is entering an ultradian rest response, saysDr Nadel, and the pattern is repeated about every 90 minutes. He says that theseare times when the body’s physiology is most attuned to intuition as four mainregulatory systems align to link the body to our higher Awareness. During theseperiods, the right hemisphere of the neocortex becomes dominant. This is thecreative, intuitive, ‘out there’ region of the brain that is so suppressed bythe education system which concentrates on the absorption of ‘facts’ at theexpense of inspirational creativity. Dr Nadel explains that the drowsiness andloss of attention during ultradian rest response reflect the changes takingplace. He says these are the times when you are more likely to say ‘Aha!’ andgain sudden insights. Ernest Rossi, author of The Psychobiology of Mind/BodyHealing, agrees. He says that during the ultradian rest response the body goesinto an intuitive mode, and we are more receptive to the unconscious realms:> This is the time when it’s easiest to access our own intuition, your own> internal imagery. Thoughts are most likely to be closer to the unconscious.> This is a time when the unconscious wants all the energy it can get. If you> train yourself to just watch and observe and not intrude, you’re going to fall> into what is called reverie or hypnagogic state, what I call its more> naturally intuitive state. Ignoring these ultradian rest response signals, or trying to suppress them, cancause people to become irritable, uncomfortable and depressed, says Dr. Nadel.But, if we go with them, they can be moments of great inspiration. He offersthis advice:> This is the best time to take a break rather than forcing yourself to push> through the fatigue. You can think of it as your intuition break, time to take> a deep breath, close your eyes, and allow impressions from your intuitive> right hemisphere to flow through your mind. If you are working on a project> and would like help from your intuition, this is the time to ask for it. It is> also a good time to meditate … > … As you become more aware of the physiology of intuition, you will find that> your body’s natural rhythms can help you ease into an intuitive state. You can> meditate productively at any time during the day, but by recognizing the onset> of your ultradian rest response, you can enhance your results by spending time> in silence while your body does its neurophysiological work. I don’t meditate in the sense of formally sitting down to do it, but I amdaydreaming all the time in the way described by Dr Nadel. These are momentswhen my mind goes quiet and stops gossiping away. It is even more effective ifyou can find a place of silence. Noise holds us in five-sense reality byattracting the attention of the hearing senses and the mind, while silenceallows you to go anywhere because within the silence is everywhere. MahatmaGandhi quite rightly said: ‘It has often occurred to me that a seeker aftertruth has to be silent’. All That Is can be ‘heard’ in the silence and this is areason why truly silent space is so rare these days, especially in the urbanareas where most people live.Daydreaming in silence, or daydreaming in any situation, allows insight to comethrough. What a statement it is about the stupidity and ignorance of ‘modern’society that when schoolchildren go into an ultradian rest response they aretold to ‘stop daydreaming and get on with your work’. When I was at school, Ialways tried to sit next to a window so I could look outside and daydream whilethey were talking about logarithms or algebra. The only thing I learned aboutalgebra was that x = find me a window. The ‘Intuition Time’ is when the body canmost effectively self-heal. Ernest Rossi points out that ‘most forms of healing,including shamanism and the holistic forms of healing, are rituals for helpingyou to get into this ultradian response because it’s so easy to entrain[synchronize]’. By observing the times when the ultradian response kicks in, wecan make the most effective use of our intuitive channels of ‘knowing’. Thedoing, doing, doing, society does not allow for such things and makes peoplefeel guilty for taking a break. The amount that we work – or ‘do’ – is seen as apositive statement about our character. But, if we are always doing rather thanbeing, we are servants of the lower mind, the intellect, rather than expressionsof Infinite Awareness. By allowing ourselves to ‘be’, we will actually beinspired to ‘do’ things far more effectively because of the insights it willbring. How often have the greatest breakthroughs come not through the intellect,primarily, but through intuitive hunch? The hunch is then followed up by theintellect and found to be valid. Our hunches, our intuition, inspiration, orwhat I call ‘knowing’, come from Infinite Awareness – not intellect.I have heard people say so many times that they were having a shower or sittingin the bath when this inspired ‘thought’ came to them out of nowhere. Others saythat they get their most profound understandings when they are driving a car. Inall these situations we go into the daydream state and that’s why the channelsopen to intuition. You’ll notice that intuitive knowing just appears apparentlyout of ‘nowhere’. There is no intellectual thought sequence being followed thatleads to an outcome. Bang! It’s just there. ‘Wow, I get it, now.’ This happensfor two reasons. Firstly, Infinite Awareness is All-Knowing, so it just knows;it doesn’t have to work things out like the intellect. Secondly, time is anillusion of the five-sense–Matrix program, so awareness beyond the Matrixcommunicates instantly in the only moment that really exists – the NOW. When wetap into our intuition, we ‘know’ in the instant we know. A sequence of thoughtsis an expression of the illusory ‘time’ construct while intuition, and wisdom,arrives in the moment – the NOW – just when we need it, because it comes fromthe realms of no-time.Standing your groundIf people asked me the single most important step in the transformation toInfinite Awareness, I would say follow your intuition or knowing. When thecomputer mind launches its offensive, as it will, stick with your intuition andsee where it goes. What you do and experience will often be seriously at oddswith mainstream thought and society. Your intuition is not following computerreality and all its dos and don’ts, musts and mustn’ts, right and wrongs, moralsand immorals. If your intuition was not leading you on another path and intoanother sense of reality it would not be Infinite Awareness, it would be anotherexpression of the program. People in computer reality will think you are crazy,weird or dangerous, but who gives a shit? I don’t. I am me, I am free and ifothers don’t like that, well too bad. This reaction to people who break themould comes from computers responding to a potential challenge and, at a deeperlevel, those who ad-lib their lives with freedom say something about those whodon’t. Subconsciously, the sight of someone expressing freedom reminds thecomputer slaves of their own conformity. ‘So shut the fuck up and conformbecause you’re upsetting me – if I have to be a robot, so should you.’ Iappreciate the offer, but no thanks.The transition can be extremely challenging as you are pressured to stay in thebox. Those around you, especially parents, can be ruthless in their use ofemotional blackmail to stop you expressing your infinite self. People tend tooperate on the ‘how does this affect me?’ principle and so often what they doand say for ‘your own good’ or because ‘I am only thinking of you’, is reallymanipulating events to suit what they want. It is another version ofpsychological fascism. To be free of the program, we need not to succumb to thisand let our intuition be our guide. Awakening people may lose their job and seetheir friends, relationships and acquaintances change. But then how can we freeourselves from the program without changing the lifestyle that the program hascreated? It is a matter of vibrational connection and when you transform yourvibrational state so your ‘magnetism’ ceases to attract the old circle andstarts to attract the new. People who change with you can stay with you for thesame reason. The trick is to trust in your intuition and you will eventuallybegin to see where it is all leading for you. If you get caught in the fear ofthe transition because of how your life is changing you will start creating areality to match what you fear. Remember, there is no scarcity only infiniteabundance. We create scarcity by believing in it and it will only disappear whenwe stop doing so. Everything in this ‘physical’ world is energy made manifestand energy is infinite. How can there be scarcity? Only if we decode reality tocreate the illusion of it.Your computer mind is like the guy paddling the canoe who can only see as far asthe next turn in the river. If the wind and waves blow him to the shore he willpaddle like crazy to resist and keep going. When he’s forced onto the bank he isfuming and frustrated at the ‘turn’ his life has taken. ‘Why me?’ ‘Why am I sounlucky?’ He will blame the wind, the maker of the boat, the cut of the paddlesand the fact that ‘God’ has forsaken him. When anything goes wrong there has tobe someone to blame because bizarrely that makes us feel better. But then ourstranded boatman meets a local while cursing on the riverside and he’s told howlucky he is. Just round the next bend is a massive waterfall and had he gone anyfurther he would have been in great danger. ‘Ah’, we say in those moments, ‘Ican now see that I was being protected’. Yes, protected by those forces that had‘forsaken’ you. I can’t stress enough, and I am speaking to myself as much asanyone, that we must trust the process of transformation because while computerreality can only see to the next bend in the river, Infinite Awareness can seeit all from source to sea. What appears to be a ‘problem’ can be a wonderfulopportunity waiting to be discovered. Life so often brilliantly disguises ourgreatest gifts as our worst nightmare. Another channelled message given to me in1990 said:> True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, but> it will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you> receive whether you like it or not. Ponder on anything you do not like and see> if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much easier. What we call the transformation is actually a process of deprogramming. It isnot so much learning as unlearning. We have always been Infinite Awareness, butthe manipulation and programming have disconnected us from that understanding.If you are buried in a hole – vibrationally in our case – the way out is toremove the dirt that lies between you and daylight. Once you do that you arefree and it is the same with our current situation. We have encased ourselves inbeliefs and these manifest energetically as dense electromagnetic fields, theeggshells as I call them, which stop us from seeing the daylight – connectingwith the Infinite Awareness that we are, always have been and ever will be. Theexperiences that we attract once we decide that we want to break out of the boxare tailored to break down the belief-densities so we can see the ‘light’. Asthis happens, more and more of our higher Awareness can flow through to thecomputer reality and the body-computer itself begins to change as its programmedperceptions are rewritten. The body has been programmed to largely be the enemyof freedom and Infinite Awareness, but it doesn’t have to be. The two can be inharmony. If you stick with your intuition through all the challenges this mightbring, your computer reality will be symbolically standing there with its armsfolded saying ‘I told you so’ whenever a new challenge arises. After a while asyour life changes for the better because of the experiences you have had, niceand not-so-nice, the computer begins to download this information and change itsown program. It sees that if you follow intuition it may present some challengesin this bewildered reality, but in the end it all works out – not despite whatyou have experienced, but because of it. The more you connect with higher levelsof Awareness, the more that energy will reprogram the computer with a higherlevel of perception. Body, mind and spirit become the ‘One’ they should be andthe war between our intuition and computer mind is ended.Energy flows where attention goes …Understanding the power of attention is vital to regaining control ofexperience. When we give our attention to something our energy flows there. Ifwe are focused on what frightens us that attention will connect us energeticallywith whatever it is we fear and the same with everything else, pleasant andunpleasant. The story goes that a Cherokee Native American was teaching hisgrandchildren about life and he said:> A fight is going on inside me ... It is a terrible fight, and it is between> two wolves. One wolf represents fear, anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed,> arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, pride and> superiority. The other wolf stands for joy, peace, love, hope, sharing,> serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, friendship, empathy, generosity,> truth, compassion and faith. This same fight is going on inside of you and> every other person too. The grandchildren thought about it for a minute and one child asked: ‘Which wolfwill win?’ The old Cherokee replied: ‘The one I feed’. Or, the one I give myattention to. When we react to a situation or make a choice it is worth askingourselves what level of Awareness our reaction or decision has come from. Ifwhat we do or decide represents fear, anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed,arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, pride andsuperiority it will be the computer program. If it is a manifestation of joy,peace, love, sharing, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, friendship,empathy, generosity and truth it will be Infinite Awareness. By rejecting thoseactions and reactions generated from the computer program and accepting onlythose from Infinite Awareness, we rewrite the program and bring ‘heart’ and‘head’ into harmony. As this happens, the body-computer stops reacting tooriginal type and becomes a willing vehicle for Infinite Awareness. We need tobe kind to ourselves when we react to program and not get caught inself-loathing or frustration. Just laugh, recognise it as a ‘Matrix Moment’, andchange the reaction or decision. This conscious recognition alone will rewritethe program by pressing the delete button.Another way to approach this is to always do what you know to be right, ratherthan what you think is right for you at the time. Infinite Awareness always doeswhat it knows to be right, but the computer is programmed to think only ofitself and its survival. There are legions of people around the world who haveworked on the inside of the conspiracy or have experienced parts of it and theycould do so much to end the tyranny if they spoke out and told what they know.That would be to do what is right by everyone. Most don’t do this because theyfear the consequences for themselves and their loved ones. I understand that,but so often what we think is right for us is nothing of the kind, either in‘spiritual’ or ‘physical’ terms. Our loved ones are going to have to live in afascist global dictatorship unless we unravel its vibrational construct throughinformation and awareness. When we withdraw from this illusory reality at themoment we call ‘death’, what are we going to perceive was truly right for us? Tohave served the fears, desires and illusions of the computer program, or to haveacted in a way that served the interests of all? It is no good people trying tokid themselves that they are doing what they know to be right when they arefollowing self-interest. We know when we’re doing that, just as a parent knowsthat behind all the attempts at self-delusion they are manipulating theirchildren to suit their own self-interest while claiming to be doing it for thechildren’s ‘own good’. Doing what you know to be right instead of what we thinkis right for us in the moment would transform life on Earth on a scale that mostwould find unimaginable today. Simple truths are devastating in their effect ifthey are followed with a passion – like the biblical ‘Do unto others as youwould have them do unto you’. Or, as Gandhi said: ‘You must be the change youwish to see in the world’.Stand up and don’t fightIt may appear that what I am saying here is a rather ‘weak’ way to overcome the‘might’ of the Reptilian hybrid conspiracy, but it isn’t. It is the only way itcan be done effectively. Everything comes from changing ourselves and overridingthe program that controls us and dictates our behaviour. I could say that wemust organise protest marches and have meetings with a minute-taker andpropositions for discussion; or that we must organise armed resistance, as someare suggesting. If we are going to challenge the conspiracy while in the sameprogram as the conspiracy what the hell good will that do? We will just createMatrix Moments on a global scale. ‘We must meet might with might and fire withfire.’ Really? What do you get in those situations? Twice the might and twicethe fire. ‘We must stand up and fight.’ Oh, good thinking; now we have two sidesfighting and I think they call that a war. ‘We must have a war to stop wars.’Hey, why don’t you fight for peace as well and then we can do two equallyuseless things at the same time? To fight for peace, to have a war to stop wars,is brainless doublethink and, much as the computer’s testosterone levels mayache for a battle, it is a battle that those in authority have all the weaponsto win. Another thing: since when did a battle to overcome a dictatorship everproduce anything more than another dictatorship under another name? Fascism,communism and democracy are all dictatorships in different forms because they’reall manifestations of the same force. ‘Outer’ peace can only come through‘inner’ peace. Black Elk, spiritual leader of the Oglala Sioux, said:> The first peace, which is the most important, is that which comes within the> souls of people when they realize their relationship, their oneness, with the> universe and all its powers, and when they realize that at the center of the> universe dwells Wakan-Taka [the Great Spirit], and that this center is really> everywhere, it is within each of us. > This is the real peace, and the others are but reflections of this. The second> peace is that which is made between two individuals, and the third is that> which is made between two nations. But above all you should understand that> there can never be peace between nations until there is known that true peace,> which, as I have often said, is within the souls of men. There needs to be a consciousness shift or nothing is going to change. How canit when the level of consciousness – Awareness – that has co-created thisvibrational prison cell will just go on adding the bars. Albert Einstein saidthat ‘problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that createdthem’. He was spot on and yet many are trying to do just that. I see researchersexposing some levels of the conspiracy, and good luck to them, but they arestill imprisoned by religious beliefs that are part of the conspiracy. I was onan American radio show when a Christian who was against the conspiracy called me‘Satan’ on the grounds that I didn’t believe in his ‘Jesus’. Never mind that Ihave given much of my life to exposing what is going on, I didn’t follow hisreligion so I was to be condemned and rejected. Such people are ‘fighting’ theconspiracy while being stitched up by it. They are never going to bring aboutfreedom, not least because they don’t actually want it. It is not freedom forall that they seek, but freedom for themselves and their beliefs. If they werein power they would impose their beliefs on the population just as fiercely asthe Illuminati today. We saw this when those who fled ‘religious persecution’ inEurope imposed their strict Puritan religion in America when they had theopportunity to do so. Of course they did; they were following the same programas those in other versions of the Christian religion who made them take flightto America. Once again, different name, same program. As I mentioned earlier, atelevision producer told me that a member of the 9/11 truth movement had said hewould not appear in a documentary if I did and this movement never asks me toits events even though I was talking and writing about the 9/11 conspiracy longbefore the possibility had even occurred to most of them. They don’t want to beassociated with me because I am going beyond their limits of perception. Theycan handle the fact that evil human beings could carry out the September 11thattacks to justify control and an invasion for oil, but once you get into theillusory nature of reality and other-dimensional entities their minds close asfast as those of other people close in relation to them and their beliefs about9/11. How often people act in the same way to others that they condemn when itis applied to them. It matters not that these ‘conspiracy’ organisations rejectme. I have always worked alone, always will, and have no interest inorganisations. I make the point as an excellent example of trying to changesomething with the same level of awareness that created it. Never has thisworked for one simple reason: it can’t.Only by accessing higher levels of Awareness can we transform that which denserlevels have created. This means opening our minds and our hearts so higherAwareness can connect. When we talk of closed minds, we are describing thesituation perfectly. The human energy field becomes a low-vibrational bubblethat repels all boarders. As I said earlier, David Shainberg, an Americanpsychiatrist from the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry in New York,suggests that thoughts are vortices of energy that can become fixed and rigid.These vortices are another level of the process that connects with the neuronnetworks and creates the rigid, repeating sequence in how they fire and thus‘read’ reality. Shainberg says that these fixed, dense vortices revealthemselves as fixed opinions, a rigid sense of reality and unchanging views. Italso goes the other way with fixed opinions and beliefs creating the densevortices and fixed neuron networks. It is these networks and low-vibrationalenergy fields (different expressions of the same beliefs) that close the chakrachannels, hold us in five-sense reality and block the conscious connection toInfinite Awareness. Like I say, even most of the conspiracy research movementwill only go so far before their rigid beliefs block the way and stop theirneurons from firing them into a higher orbit where a much bigger picture can beseen. Such people also want to maintain their ‘credibility’ with the public andthey allow the perception limits of most of the population to become theirs. Be‘credible’, be a mind-slave, you know it makes sense.The first step to breaking these concrete energy fields that hold us inignorance and servitude is to stop judging everything by reflex action. Openyour mind to All Possibility. This doesn’t mean to accept everything you hear,of course not. It means to stop rejecting something simply because it is at oddswith your current perception of reality and possibility. Remember that AllPossibility means anything is possible. That may sound obvious, but it isusually forgotten. This doesn’t mean that because something is possible it mustbe happening; it only means that it is possible, so let it in and allow it toassimilate without instant dismissal. Already the energy will be flowing farmore smoothly and powerfully as your mind opens and the energetic eggshellstarts to crack (Figure 256, overleaf). Now open your heart and feel theinformation you are considering. What does your intuition, your knowing tell youabout it? Never mind what your thoughts are saying; what is your intuitiontelling you about its validity? Is it a ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘maybe’ or ‘some truth init, but more to understand’? By opening your heart, I mean opening your heartvortex in the centre of the chest which, I find, is the most powerful connectionto intuitive knowing. Visualise it opening ever wider and it will open becauseenergy responds to consciousness. How could it not when energy is consciousness?These simple principles of opening your mind to All Possibility, filteringinformation and experience through your intuitive knowing and being the changeyou wish to see in the world will transform your life and take you onto a muchhigher level of Awareness. Your vibrational state will quicken and become morepowerfully magnetic and you will be able to make the conscious connection withInfinite Awareness – the still and silent, self-aware All.Notice of intentWhen it comes to what you want to do with your life, intuition is governoragain. It will guide you along the paths you planned to take before you enteredthis reality. If you follow only mind, the programs and manipulation can causeyou to become lost in the maze and not experience what you have chosen to do. Ifyou are five-feet two and thin as a rake, it is safe to say your destiny is notto be world heavyweight boxing champion. If that had been your goal yourAwareness would not have chosen that type of body-computer. What is yourpassion? What is your dream? What makes you feel happy and fulfilled? What doesyour intuition tell you? These are guiding lights to the paths we need to take.Life is not supposed to be hard, that’s one of the greatest controlling myths ofall. It seems hard because of the way we perceive experience. It’s like the guypaddling down the river. If he perceives everything to be happening for a reasonhe will happily park his boat on the shore and know there will be a positiveexplanation for why he cannot continue his journey. The alternative is to getangry and frustrated and then life appears ‘hard’ when it is only a differentperception of the same experience. The same applies when I talk about thechallenges we face as we go through the transformation, the ‘Shift’. It doesn’thave to be ‘hard’. We can welcome the challenges and our old lives falling apartin the knowledge that this is confirmation that the changes that we seek areunderway. Or, we can treat every challenge as a disaster and ‘something goingwrong’, in which case it can appear to be a nightmare. Once again, it is neitherone nor the other, it is our perception and we control that.When you make the choice – the intent – of where you wish to go and what youwish to do, you are projecting the frequency, the magnetism, which relates tothat intent. The deeper you know it will happen, and the less you merely hope,the more powerful will be the magnetic field, or magnetic feelers, that yourintent transmits. Everything is energy – people, places, information andexperiences – and you will start to see how your magnetic projections carryingthe frequency of your intent will attract to you through apparent ‘coincidence’the people, places, information and experiences that help you achieve yourdesire. If you are on your chosen path everything will synchronise and flow andthe journey can appear almost effortless. The coincidences are not inexplicableor ‘magic’; they are compatible magnetic fields being drawn to each other.‘Fancy seeing you here’ and ‘what a small world’ are expressions of this. Manytimes people have told me how they went into a bookshop and one of my books, orothers, dropped off the shelf in front of them. It seems incredible, but it isso simple. They were seeking knowledge and they were magnetically projectingthat intent, often subconsciously. As a result, their energy field connectedmagnetically with the energy field of the book and literally pulled it off theshelf. Life is so wonderful if only we would allow it to be. It is ‘rational’thought and emotion that get in the way of this flow and when that happens thesynchronicity can’t work effectively. Intuition says go this way andcomputer-thought says no. If we follow the computer we stay in the program andignore our intuition as it sits there revving up the getaway car. If you findthat things are not happening smoothly there is something disrupting the energyflow. It could be your computer-mind leading you down the wrong road and youstart to fight the intuitive flow instead of going with it. This is like pushingagainst a padlocked door. You can push all you like, curse all you like and getas frustrated as you like, but it’s not going to open because you don’t have theenergetic combination. You’ve got the key to 303 and this is 101. In these timesconsult your intuition, not your mind, and see where it takes you. When you findthe flow again, and it may well not lead you where your computer-mind wants togo, you will find the synchronicity is back and the right doors fling open.Another reason why a door may not open is that it’s not meant to do so – yet.There is a sequence, or appears to be in this reality, and when you are tryingto do something out of sequence it doesn’t happen. When you try the same door inthe right sequence it opens, again like a combination lock. In many ways, thatis what we’re doing in these circumstances. We are unravelling the combinationcodes to the Matrix so that it starts working with us and not against.Image [../Images/00265.jpg]Figure 256: Open your mind, crack the eggshell, and let infinity come in. Thisis a good image to use as a focus for visualising your own eggshell cracking Candles in the darknessOnce we begin to awaken, break out from our vibrational prisons and connect withhigher levels of Awareness, we start to attract into our lives other people whoare on the same wavelength. There are two ways that we connect in this reality:through the infinite field of Awareness and our DNA transmitter-receivers. Bothexplain what we call ‘telepathy’. As we allow a higher level of Awareness intothe computer level of reality, so our DNA transmissions start to reflect thatand we become ever more powerful transmitters of these higher frequencies. Thisnot only increases our potential for creativity and manifestation of‘coincidence’, it makes these frequencies accessible to other DNA receivers topick up. Instead of minds having to open to crack the concrete themselves andaccess Infinite Awareness, these DNA transmissions from awakening people canbreak it up at the computer level. It is like the violin example of sympatheticresonance in which the most powerful frequency resonates others onto itswavelength. We can see an example of this with the ‘mystery’ known as thehundredth monkey syndrome in which a few members of an animal species are taughtsomething new and suddenly all or large numbers of the species, even fardistances away, begin to do the same thing without being shown. Every specieshas its unique genetic DNA code or broadcast signal and when the few have beentaught a new understanding this transmits on that wavelength, the ‘speciesInternet’, and is picked up by the DNA of others. The knowledge is downloadedand others do instinctively what the pioneer few have had to learn. Animals arevery sensitive to this because they haven’t been desensitised by the educationsystem or the media all their lives, but human DNA has the potential to work inexactly the same way. The more people who awaken to connect with InfiniteAwareness, the more they will transmit those frequencies on the DNA ‘bushtelegraph’ for others to pick up and the awakening becomes an exponential curve.The ‘Magnu’ channelling said:> As the consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those of you Light> Workers who are working together to raise your consciousness, you will be able> to hold more and more refined vibrations, and so we will be able to use you as> a catalyst to be able to feed in more and more energies. For these higher energies to affect this ‘world’ they have to be ‘grounded’ inthis dimension and this is done by people becoming conduits who can access thesehigh frequencies and bring them down into five-sense reality. This is one reasonwhy awakening people seem to have great challenges in their lives. Theirfive-sense experiences ground them, and stop their ‘human’ level from gettingvibrationally detached from those they are seeking to help. While they areconnecting with high frequencies, their ‘human’ feet have to stay firmly rootedhere to ground that energy. When people ask ‘what can little me do?’ the answeris that you can change the world by changing yourself. Of course, there are‘physical’ actions we need to take as well, but we will know what these are whenwe access higher levels of Awareness. From that perspective we will no longer betrying to change something with the same level of awareness that created it. Wewill be able to see new ways of living and perceiving that will lead us to takeaction that will achieve the desire for universal freedom. In such an energeticenvironment, the Reptilian hybrid conspiracy construct will collapse like aglass explodes when exposed to a high enough note. That ‘note’ will sound when:> •We have so freed ourselves of indoctrinated belief that we stop fighting> along the fault lines of irrelevant division like race, religion, politics and> income bracket.> •When we truly want freedom and justice for all and not only for ourselves and> those we agree with.> •When we celebrate diversity of perception and lifestyle and realise that> right and wrong, good and bad, moral and immoral are often just ways of saying> different.> •When we stop seeking to impose our views on others and allow people to be> themselves so long as they don’t impose their will on others.> •When we do what we know to be right and not what we think is right for us in> the moment.> •When we stop conforming to the herd mentality because we fear expressing our> uniqueness.> •When we live our lives as Infinite Awareness and not computer software.Once we stop fearing for our survival in all its forms, physical, financial,social, sexual and all the other multitude of fears that have survival at theircore, we stop being controlled by the reptilian brain through which, notsurprisingly, much of the Reptilian hybrid control is routed. Fear is the primeweapon of control and when we stop being frightened the manipulators aredisarmed. Fear is the densest of all mental and emotional states and as itdissolves so does its energetic expression – the eggshell. What is there to fearwhen we are Infinite Awareness that can never die and when this ‘physical’ worldwhich we take so seriously is only an illusion we construct in our minds?Cry freedomThere are practical steps we can take simply by changing our attitudes and thiscan be done in an instant. We need to be passionate about freedom and justice,which apply to everyone or to no one. If a single person is not free there is nofreedom because freedom cannot be divided into haves and have nots. You can’t bea little bit free, individually and collectively, any more than you can be alittle bit pregnant. We either have freedom or we don’t, and at the moment wedon’t because we refuse to express what is ours. Freedom is not the gift of thedark suits or the military uniforms; it is our natural state, our infinite andeternal right. The manipulators have sought to take it from us, but we don’thave to ‘fight’ for its return because it has never gone away. We are still freeand, as Infinite Awareness, always will be. The problem is that we have ceasedto express that freedom and allow others to do so. Those who are knowinglybehind the conspiracy cannot control six billion people by themselves and theyhave to manipulate the population to control each other. They do this throughtheir uniformed puppets who daily impose the very Orwellian society that theirown children will have to live in; they do it through their Propaganda Ministry,the mainstream media, staffed by so many ‘intellectual’ prostitutes who areselling the system that, once again, has them and their children in its sights;and they do it through their armed forces who kill people they have never met,and know nothing about, on the say-so of some tosser in a dark suit who wouldshite his pants at the very thought of going where he is sending others. As aresult of this pawn-ography, these puppets advance the day when their ownfamilies and children will be microchipped zombies of the state. When theuniforms, soldiers and ‘journalists’ have the insight and foresight to rebel andrefuse to be tools of their fascist masters we will see how little power theReptilian hybrids really have. Their power is merely the power that humans giveto them every day – ‘Yes sir, no sir, anything you say sir’.If those journalists at Fox News and elsewhere stopped complaining aboutcensorship and bias and just walked out the door or collectively went on strikeuntil the bias ended, the news fixers would be exposed and, if enough people didit, the mainstream media would be unable to function. The media hacks don’t dothis because of a mixture of ignorance of how they are being used and therecurring question that always sounds the death knell for freedom: ‘How would itaffect me?’ If police officers refused to enforce laws designed only toconstruct a dictatorship, the politicians and Shadow People would have no meansto impose their will on the population. It is pathetic to watch police officersacting as bagmen for dictators who want to make the lives of their children andgrandchildren a microchipped misery. The police don’t rebel because of a mixtureof ignorance of how they are being used and the question: ‘How would it affectme?’ The military are the same. Politicians don’t invade countries and directlybomb, kill and maim the innocent. They tell their soldiers to do that whiletreating them with utter contempt, or as ‘dumb, stupid animals’, as Kissingerput it. If the troops refused to slaughter and be slaughtered there could be nomore wars of conquest and control. They don’t rebel because of a mixture ofignorance of how they are being used and the question: ‘How would it affect me?’If these three groups alone refused to be pawns of the Orwellian state theconspiracy would collapse and, as I have said to some of them, the point is fastapproaching when many will desperately wish they had. ‘What were you doing whenthe fascist state came in mummy and daddy?’ ‘I was enforcing it, dear; now don’tplay with that telescreen.’ These propaganda and enforcement professions need toget informed about what is really going on and develop the balls to do somethingabout it. Don’t hold your breath, though.We need a peaceful mass refusal to cooperate with the system that seeks tocontrol us, for it has no power without our cooperation. There are billions ofpeople and a relative handful of those in positions of real power. When we say‘no’ en masse to their orders and dictates there is nothing they can do. Insteadof complaining, but then complying, we need to refuse to obey laws that have nobasis in fairness and sanity and are only there to control and suppress. Thereis no need for violent rebellion, just peaceful non-cooperation. The Orwellianworld can only be introduced if we allow it and this is where divide and rulecomes in again. The Reptilian hybrid networks manipulate those not subject to anew law to oppose and condemn the actions of those protesting against it. Then,when another law comes along that affects the condemning faction, they protestwhile being condemned by those who were protesting themselves over somethingelse. It is vital that we unite behind freedom for all and support everyone intheir pursuit of fairness and justice. While people are arguing among themselvesthey are preparing the way for their own enslavement and that of their children.The fascist global state will not just apply to one party, race or religion, butto all of them. The technique is to demonise one religion or group by turningother religions, groups and people against it. When that has been destroyed,they do the same with another until all of them have been picked off. As thesaying goes:> First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.> Then they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a> Communist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out> because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and there was no one> left to speak out for me. We need to care about the freedom of others as much as we do about our own.Injustice is injustice no matter what form it takes or who it affects.United they fallThe real force for change has to be the ‘ordinary’ people, as they arepatronisingly called. In fact, there are no ‘ordinary’ people only extraordinaryInfinite Awareness trapped in the illusion of being ‘ordinary’. There aremillions in positions of authority and billions of ‘ordinary’ people. I think Isee a way out of this. The millions control the billions through fear and divideand rule and they will go on doing so until we change our perception of both. Weneed to make our commitment to doing what we know to be right more powerful thanour fear of the consequences. If we do this in large enough numbers, and refuseto be divided and ruled, the conspiracy is no more. You can see divide and ruleeverywhere in religions, race, politics, income bracket, pressure groups andevery aspect of society. Each group battles for supremacy and seeks to prosperat the expense of others. The middle class is played off against the workingclass, Christianity and Judaism against Islam, right against left, white againstblack and black against not-so-black. I shake my head in daily despair at thekindergarten mentality that holds this conflict construct together. Only aconsciousness shift to higher Awareness can sort out the mess and without thatnothing will or even can change. We are trapped in the illusion by identifyingwho we are with the computer level of reality – Joe Bloggs, Mary Smith. When westart identifying with Infinite Awareness the divisions between us start todissolve as we see that there is no ‘us’, only the Infinite ‘I’ in all itsunique expressions. We are fighting ourselves while believing we are fightingothers and all the global conflict is simply self-abuse. Divide and rule isdividing and ruling the whole by setting it at war with itself. The biggest stepof all in the revival of freedom is to understand that we are Infinite Awarenesshaving a ‘physical’ experience and stop believing the experience is who we are.Everything comes from this.Even before that level of understanding is fully integrated we can make thechoice to no longer seek power over others. The desire for power ‘over’ ratherthan power to create is an extremely reptilian trait and expressed through thereptilian brain. It is also a classic confirmation of insecurity. Those who aresecure in themselves have no desire to have power over others. Why would they?They have no need to prove how powerful or successful they are through externalsymbols like uniforms, titles or position. They don’t need confirmation fromothers that they have ‘made it’ when they are already at peace with themselves.Such people act on the basis of justice not the desire to show how powerful theyare by abusing their position to impose their will over others. I see this allthe time at all levels of society, even down to some of the little dictatorsthat administer children’s sport. ‘I’m in charge and it will be done my way eventhough what I am imposing is ludicrous, childish and arrogant beyond belief.’ Inmany ways the lower ranks of power can be more obsessed with control than somehigher ups, probably because they have more insecurity to camouflage. I have hadmany amusing moments watching the ‘community policeman’ in my town marchingthrough the streets giving out his orders and reaching orgasm when he spots acar that’s five minutes over the parking limit. He thinks he’s so powerful whenhe’s just a tool of a system that will eventually spit him out like pips from agrape.Setting each other freeIf we really want to play a role in the restoration of freedom we need to stopseeking power over others and find peace in people being different and enjoyingthe right to free choice and free expression even if we don’t agree with whatthey do or say. I have a simple philosophy: do what you like so long as youdon’t impose it on others. The first part of that sentence may seem like afree-for-all, but the second part ensures that it’s not. ‘Oh, so you’re sayingpeople should have the freedom to murder and abuse children then?’ Er, no,actually. That would hardly meet the criteria of not imposing your will onanother. This one simple sentence, ‘Do what you like so long as you don’t imposeit on others’, contains both the freedom to do and the freedom not to have doneto. That’s the society I would like to live in. I am sick of people tellingothers what they can and can’t do. I hear Christians complaining about Orwelliancontrols that affect them while telling other people what they can and cannot doon the basis of some reference they have found in the Bible written by who knowswho knows when. ‘Homosexuality is the devil’s work’, I hear some say. Well,don’t do it then, mate, just don’t tell others what they can or cannot do. Ichallenge any imposition of homosexuality as much as I challenge anyone whoseeks to outlaw it and the same with everything. If you don’t like it, or don’tapprove of it, then don’t do it. I am only interested when it is being forcedupon people against their will.Parents need to respect their children’s right to go their own way and pursuetheir own passion without seeking to use guilt and other manipulation techniquesto ‘guide’ them in the direction that suits the parents. We bring children intothis reality so they can freely experience, not to be their life-long dictators.We can advise them, of course, but they have to make the choice of what they doand where they go when they have reached the age where they can make thosedecisions. A loving parent respects that and even if they don’t agree with themthey are always there to support no matter what. Any parent who seeks to imposea religion, belief system or lifestyle on their offspring is a psychologicalfascist and they need to be told diplomatically, or otherwise if necessary,where to stick it. Young people need to rebel against such impositions andrefuse to yield their uniqueness to them. Only then can the cycle be broken. Ifthis upsets their parents, well too bad. The parent-child connection should be apartnership, not a dictatorship. I don’t agree with religious schools of anykind because they are places of belief indoctrination on a scale even moreextreme than the ‘education’ system in general. If young people want to follow areligion good luck to them, but it should be a free choice when other choiceshave been explored and not the result of a mind-control operation almost frombirth called a ‘religious school’. Parents who send their children to religiousschools have no respect for their free-right to choose. In the same way,children should not be telling their parents what they can and cannot do withtheir lives. Freedom always goes both ways or it does not exist. Your freedom ismy freedom.It’s just a rideWhat I have outlined in this chapter will, if instigated, bring an end to theconspiracy and its Orwellian world by ending the belief and behaviour traitsthat allow it to happen. The walls of suppression will come down when we stopsuppressing ourselves and each other, and when we stop allowing differingbeliefs and perceptions to become the fault lines through which we are dividedand ruled. When we are at peace with someone else looking, acting and believingdifferently to us, we will no longer be divided. Without division, there can beno rule by the few. The greatest transformation of life in this reality willcome, however, as the eggshells crack and we remember who and where we are. Weare everything (and nothing); we are everywhere (and nowhere); we are all thatis, has been and ever will be, all existing in the eternal and infinite NOW. Wehave just been manipulated to forget that. There is no ‘little me’ unless weallow our belief to create the illusion of it, and there is not even a ‘we’,only an infinite ‘I’. As this book has been almost a compendium of my work fromsome twenty years of experience and research, I am going to finish with my twofavourite quotes from previous books. They come from a brilliant Americancomedian called Bill Hicks, who left us in 1994, aged just thirty-two. Peoplecan quote all the mystics and crossed-legged people they like, but this guyunderstood as much, if not more, than most of them. He once described realitymagnificently in one of his jokes: ‘… All matter is merely energy condensed to aslow vibration; we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively;there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are theimagination of ourselves’. What an encapsulation of the truth that has beendenied us for so long. At the end of his act, Bill would don his coat and cowboyhat and leave the audience with this thought:> The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on> it, you think it’s real, because that’s how powerful our minds are.

It’s our ride and our choice of where we want it to go. This is what themanipulators have worked so hard to keep from us. But the truth is out and thegenie is free and what we do with this knowledge is now our own responsibility.We can ‘change the world’ or we can run and hide. As always, like Bill said,it’s just a choice between fear and love.Thanks for listening and enjoy the ride."},{"pageContent":"Dream Within A Dream by Edgar Allen Poe> Take this kiss upon the brow!> > And, in parting from you now,> > Thus much let me avow –> > You are not wrong, who deem> > That my days have been a dream;> > Yet if hope has flown away> > In a night, or in a day,> > In a vision, or in none,> > Is it therefore the less gone?> > All that we see or seem> > Is but a dream within a dream."},{"pageContent":"Appendix 1 Barack Obama: the naked emperor I am adding this appendix about Barack Obama in November 2008 as I watch withdismay as vast numbers of people across the world, including many who shouldknow better, have been duped by the mind-game called Operation Obama.Even people with some understanding of the conspiracy have said things like:‘Well, at least he’s not Bush’ and ‘Well, at least it’s great to see such a newspirit of hope’. No, he’s not Bush – he’s potentially far more dangerous; andwhat is the use of a spirit of ‘hope’ if it’s based on a lie? In fact, what useis ‘hope’ at all?image [../Images/00266.jpg]Figure 1: Behind the painted smile Obama’s wife, Michelle, who I wouldn’t trust to tell me the date in a calendarfactory, said that ‘everything begins and ends with hope’. Utter nonsense. Hopeis a meaningless emotion because its fruits are always in the future and, bydefinition, never in the NOW. Hope is like riding a carousel horse; no matterhow fast you go you never get closer to the one in front. The idea, however, isto persuade you to stay on the horse, despite the evitable disappointment, inthe ‘hope’ that things will change. But they don’t because the very system isdesigned to prevent it. That’s the way ‘hope’ is employed by the dastardly anddevious – take the crap we are giving you now in the ‘hope’ that things will getbetter (but we know they won’t). Barack Obama is a purveyor of ‘hope’ becausehis masters want the people to accept what they are given now in the hope thatgood times will come (Figure 1). Just do what we demand, oops, sorry, Barackdemands, and in return he’ll inspire you to hope that it is all leading to thePromised Land. It isn’t, but, by the time you realise that, it’s too late. Whatterrifies the manipulators is that people will abandon hope, as a future,sometime-never projection, and start to demand fairness, justice and freedomnow. To avoid this nightmare they need to keep those desires as something toaspire to, not to actually have. Thus, their man, Obama, sells ‘hope’ as adiversion technique, a holding position, to keep the masses from trulyrebelling. We have no job, no food on the table and our home has beenforeclosed, but at least we have ‘hope’. Phew, thank goodness for that.> ‘I’m hungry, mum, can I have some hope, please?’ > ‘I’m so sorry, darling, you can’t have hope today, only tomorrow - hope is> always tomorrow.’ > ‘So will I eat tomorrow, mum?’ > ‘We can hope so now, dear, but when we get to tomorrow, we can only hope it’s> the next day.’ On and on it goes. That’s how ‘hope’ works. Or rather doesn’t.Obama’s predominant mantra is ‘change’. Indeed, his massively-funded,record-breaking campaign was based on that one word – change. This is atechnique used by Bill Clinton and many others and it is highly effectivebecause, at any point, the system ensures that most people are not happy withthe way life is. So, when you don’t like the status quo, ‘change’ can be apotent message, even if, like Obama, you don’t say what it means. It has beenvital to his success, and that of his controllers, that he has never specifiedwhat his ‘hope’, ‘change’, and that other mind-control trigger-word, ‘believe’,were referring to in terms of policy and the way society in general will beaffected. Hope for what? Change what? Believe in what? To answer those questionswith specifics would have been fatal to Obama’s appeal.I studied the military/government mind-control programmes and techniques ingreat detail for many years during the late-1990s and across 2000, and the Obama‘phenomenon’ is the most blatant mass-mind control operation you could wish tosee. At its core the plan has been to make Obama the focus of everything youhope for, believe in and want to change. This is why it has been crucial for himnot to specify and detail what is meant by his ‘hope, ‘change’ and ‘believe’.However, I can tell you what those words mean in the context of the Obamamind-game. They mean whatever you decide they mean or want them to mean. Theidea is for you to project all that you stand for onto him and so he becomes thesymbol of you and how you see the world. Specifics would destroy that ‘I amwhatever you want me to be’ scenario and so you don’t get any detail, just‘hope’, ‘change’, and ‘believe’. They don’t want him to be seen only as ‘theMessiah’; they also want him to be Abraham Lincoln, JFK, or Buddha – anyone youchoose to project on him, for he is a blank page, blank screen and empty suit.Obama is a make-your-own, do-it-yourself leader, a projection of your own mind.(If you are still asleep, that is. If you are in any way awake, he’s an openbook.)There is no more powerful way of manipulating people than to tell them what theywant to hear and to keep shtum about anything they wouldn’t like. Double-glazingsalesmen are trained to pick up in general conversation what their target likesand dislikes and to respond accordingly in the way the product is sold. Thetechnique is simply to tell the potential buyer what you have gleaned they wantto be told. Obama comes from the same stable, but on a massively bigger scaleand with a whole network of advisors and controllers steeped in the art ofmanipulating minds, opinions and actions. Obama’s written-for-him speeches arenot from the heart, but from the autocue. The ‘heart’ bit comes from extensivetraining and his Bill Clintonesque ability to ‘mean it when he says it’, a stateof delivery that goes beyond mere acting. Tony Blair was trained in the sameway. But if you take a step back and look at these people dispassionately youcan clearly see the techniques they consciously employ. Blair is the mostblatant fraud in the way he delivers a line, stops in mid-sentence for emphasisand looks down for fake emotional effect. Obama is a little more slick, but,from where I have been looking this past year, not much. You can see his mindworking, turning between autocue screens to his left and right, then straightdown the camera for his key messages. From-the-heart orators don’t do that; theyare too immersed in what they are feeling and saying to give even a passingthought to where they are looking or how the line is delivered. I worked intelevision for more than a decade, often reading autocue while a director spokein my ear telling me what cameras to look at. I have, since the early 1990s,spoken my truth on public stages across the world. I know, therefore, thedifference between artificial autocue delivery and body language and talkingfrom the heart without a script. Obama, I repeat, is coming from the autocue,not the heart. Obama’s speeches are a mass of mind-control techniques andNeuro-Linguistic Programming, or NLP, and they are carefully constructed toimplant beliefs and perceptions into the mind of the viewer.image [../Images/00267.jpg]Figure 2: Obama’s America … image [../Images/00268.jpg]Figure 3: … Hitler’s Germany. There may seem to be a world of difference, butthe techniques are just the same As I keep emphasising, the whole Obama circus is an exercise in mass mindcontrol and it has been so successful because so many people live their lives ina permanent state of trance. All of which brings me to the parallels with NaziGermany, fascist Italy and similar regimes throughout history. Obama may notlook like Hitler, nor sound like Hitler, but the themes are just the same.Germany was in a terrible state economically and militarily in the 1930s in theaftermath of the First World War and the reparations inflicted on the country bythe Rothschild/Illuminati-controlled Versailles ‘Peace’ Conference in 1919. Fromamid the chaos came the man that Germans saw then in much the same way that somany see Obama today. His name was Adolf Hitler and his oratory and rhetoric,again supported by a ritualistic presentation founded on mind-controltechniques, made him appear to be the German ‘messiah’, the German Obama. Hitlerpromised ‘change’, ‘hope’ and something to ‘believe in’ amidst the consequencesof war and financial collapse. He spoke to vast rallies of adoring followers anda mass movement emerged in support of Hitler’s vision of a new tomorrow (Figures2 and 3). As the writer Webster Tarpley points out, fascism in its true sense isnot just a police state imposed by a tiny hierarchy. It might end up like that,but first it is brought to power by a mass movement from within the people whohave no understanding of what the ‘change’, hope’ and ‘believe’ they are beingoffered really means. They just know that they want some because, as with Obama,they make it mean what they want it to mean. Only later do they see, to theirhorror, what they have signed up for. Obama is far more dangerous than Bushbecause he can sell a line to those who are in the trance while Boy Bush couldnot do that on anything like the same scale. Bush was a transparent idiot withno communication skills who needed massive fraud at the polls to get himofficially ‘elected’. He could never be the figurehead to inspire a massmovement of the people to support some vacuous ‘hope’, ‘change’ and ‘believe’when they don’t even know what those words are supposed to mean. But Obamaclearly can, because he has. One of ‘his’ (his controllers’) prime targets arethe young, just as they were with the Nazis and the Hitler Youth Movement. Inline with this theme, the WorldNetDaily website reported:> ‘The official website of President-Elect Barack Obama, Change.gov, originally> announced that Obama would “require” all middle school through college> students to participate in community service programs; but after a flurry of> blogs protested children being drafted into Obama's proposed youth corps, the> website’s wording was softened. > Originally, under the tab “America Serves”, Change.gov read, “President-Elect> Obama will expand national service programs like AmeriCorps and Peace Corps> and will create a new Classroom Corps to help teachers in under served> schools, as well as a new Health Corps, Clean Energy Corps, and Veterans> Corps. > “Obama will call on citizens of all ages to serve America, by developing a> plan to require 50 hours of community service in middle school and high school> and 100 hours of community service in college every year,” the site> announced.’ Obama said in a speech in July 2008 in Colorado Springs that he wanted to see a‘civilian national security force’ that would be as powerful and well-funded asthe Marines, Navy and Air Force. As Joseph Farah, founder of WorldNetDaily,wrote:> ‘If we’re going to create some kind of national police force as big, powerful> and well-funded as our combined U.S. military forces, isn’t this rather a big> deal? I thought Democrats generally believed the U.S. spent too much on the> military. > How is it possible their candidate is seeking to create some kind of massive> but secret national police force that will be even bigger than the Army, Navy,> Marines and Air Force put together? Is Obama serious about creating some kind> of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that? If not, why> did he say it? What did he mean?’ Obama meant, amid the flowery words, that he’s not in favour of either peace orfreedom. He is a front-man demagogue for the same force that controlled BoyBush, Clinton, Father Bush, Reagan, Carter, ad infinitum; but the difference isthat he has been hyped to such hysterical proportions that he will be allowed toget away with far more than they were, at least until reality dawns on the massranks of his hypnotised supporters. And, clearly, that could take some time.When I was a journalist 30 years ago, I came across a technique that sometabloid newspaper reporters would use to get someone to speak with them. Theywould work in pairs with the first one knocking on the door of some distressedfamily who didn’t want to talk with the media. He would tell them he was from anewspaper he didn’t really work for and treat them with aggression and contemptto make them even more upset. He would then leave and his colleague would knockon the door, tell them the real newspaper he was from, and act like Mr. NiceGuy. He would say that he understood completely how upsetting the other man musthave been, but ‘if you will only speak to me exclusively I will make sure thatthe other man, nor anyone like him, will bother you again’. They usually agreedand the scam was complete. Much the same thing is happening with regard to Bushand Obama. The Neoconservative ‘Republican’ wing of the Illuminati controlledBush for eight years and led the country into foreign wars and financial chaos(bad guy/problem); now the ‘Democratic’ wing, led by the infamous ZbigniewBrzezinski, has brought forth the ‘saviour’, Barack Obama, to lead us into thesunshine with ‘hope’ and ‘change’ (good guy/solution). Hence even some moreaware people say: ‘At least he’s not Bush’.Apart from the unspecified ‘hope, ‘change’ and ‘believe’, few have any idea whatObama’s policies will be. Public perception comes from having an ‘image’ of him,or a self-projection, not the fine print because Obama doesn’t do fine printuntil the votes are cast and even then he will hide it in his windbag words.There is an ‘image’ that Obama is against war, but no he’s not. He says he’sagainst the invasion of Iraq, though we’ll see what he does about that inoffice. How can a man calling for more troops, including European troops, to besent to Afghanistan be against war? He has also said he is prepared to bombPakistan and use military force to stop Iran building nuclear weapons. Obamaisn’t against war at all and, if his controllers have their way, he will engagethe US in even more foreign conflicts with the troops sent to their deaths, andthe deaths of their targets, on a wave of oratory from the dark suit with theblack face who would never go where he’s sending them. He claims to be a‘uniter’, which is exactly what Bush said about himself before he came tooffice, but unity in and of itself is not the issue. Nazi Germany had unity inthe early years of the war, but was that a good thing? What matters is what theunity is designed to achieve and Obama’s much-vaunted ‘unity’ is to ‘inspire’ amass movement to support the Orwellian plans of the Illuminati. His constantrhetoric about ‘bringing people together’ can be used to justify the ‘comingtogether’ of the United States, Canada and Mexico in the North American Union;it can be used to unite the believers in their opposition and condemnation ofnon-believers, which is precisely what happened in Nazi Germany with thebook-burning and violent suppression of those who challenged the Hitler regime.The potential of Obama Mania is endless when it comes to selling fascism as‘hope, change’, ‘freedom’ and a ‘New America’, or ‘New World’ [Order]. Bush andCheney were transparent warmongers and would always have struggled to bring inthe draft, the compulsory enlistment of people into the military against theirwill. But it would not be as difficult for Obama in the current climate. Forgoodness sake, he’s already talking about compulsory community service formiddle school, high school and college students and creating a peoples' army inAmerica. That’s why I say Obama is far more dangerous to freedom than Bush. Inthe last eight years Bush could only get part of the way to fascism – Obama hasthe potential to finish the job, for all the reasons I have mentioned and more.You only have to look at the cabal behind Obama, and those he has alreadyappointed to his administration team, to see what his ‘change’ is truly plannedto be. His mentor, svengali and main controller is Zbigniew Brzezinski, JimmyCarter’s National Security Advisor, and the co-founder, with David Rockefeller,of the Illuminati’s Trilateral Commission. Brzezinski has admitted publicly thathe began to fund and train what he would call today ‘terrorists’ in Afghanistanto oppose the Soviet-controlled government in the capital, Kabul, in the late1970s. The idea, he said, was to entice the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistanto protect the Kabul regime and thus give the rival superpower ‘their Vietnam’.The plan worked at the cost of a million Afghan lives during the Sovietoccupation from 1979 to 1989, a consequence that troubles Brzezinski not at all.Brzezinski’s ‘freedom fighters’ would become known as the 'Mujahideen' and laterthe Taliban and what is claimed to be ‘Al-Qaeda’. This is the man behind‘anti-war’, Barack Obama. It was common knowledge that President Carter would donothing involving foreign policy without the okay from Brzezinski, theco-founder of the Trilateral Commission which chose Carter for president. TheTrilateral Commission and the wider Brzezinski network, including Illuminatifronts like the Ford Foundation, have now chosen Obama and the situation will bethe same. Brzezinski will call the shots; Obama’s job is simply to sell them tothe people. This is rather alarming when you think that Brzezinski wants totrigger a war involving Russia and China. ‘Obama’s’ policies come straight fromBrzezinski’s books. Here is one Brzezinski quote you might recognise and it wasmade before Obama ran for president:> ‘Needed social reassessment … can be encouraged by deliberate civic education> that stresses the notion of service to a higher cause than oneself. As some> have occasionally urged, a major step in that direction would be the adoption> of an obligatory period of national service for every young adult, perhaps> involving a variety of congressionally approved domestic or foreign good> works.’ Now where have I heard that before?As an Illuminati operative, Brzezinski’s aim is to create a world government,central bank, currency and army - a global dictatorship - underpinned by amicrochipped population connected to a global computer/satellite system. Hewrote a book in 1970, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era,in which he described the global society that he and the Illuminati seek toimpose:> 'The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled> society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by> traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous> surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files> containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files> will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.' He also said in the same book nearly 40 years ago:> 'Today we are again witnessing the emergence of transnational elites ...> [Whose] ties cut across national boundaries ... It is likely that before long> the social elites of most of the more advanced countries will be highly> internationalist or globalist in spirit and outlook ... The nation-state is> gradually yielding its sovereignty ... Further progress will require greater> American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary> structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the present> relatively favorable American position.' And what does his puppet, Obama, now say that Americans have to do to bringabout ‘change’? ‘Make sacrifices’. As Mrs. Demagogue, Michelle, said:> ‘We need a different leadership because our souls are broken. We need to be> inspired … to make the sacrifices that are needed to push us to a different> place.’ You can bet that this will include sacrificing more sovereignty and freedom onthe road to the global dictatorship described by Brzezinski for decades.Brzezinski’s son, Mark, was an ‘advisor’ to the Obama campaign (doing what hisfather told him) and, in line with the American one-party-state, his other son,Ian, was foreign policy advisor to the McCain campaign (doing what his fathertold him). Brzezinski’s daughter, Mika, reported the campaign for MSNBCtelevision. Obama has been the chosen one for a long time, a fact known only toa few in the deep inner circle, and his relationship with Brzezinski almostcertainly goes back to the start of the 1980s when he attended the Ivy League,and big-time Illuminati, Columbia University where Brzezinski was head of theInstitute for Communist Affairs. Obama simply will not talk in any detail aboutthis period. And a question: Does anyone really believe that someone, a ‘man ofthe people’, would simply appear from apparently nowhere to run the slickest andbest-funded presidential campaign in American history? He was chosen long ago bythose who wish to enslave the very people that Obama says he wants to ‘setfree’.Then there is the Jewish financier, George Soros, the multi-billionaireassociate of Brzezinski and closely involved with the funding and marketing ofObama. Soros is a former board member of the Illuminati’s Council on ForeignRelations and funds the European Council on Foreign Relations. In short, he is amajor insider. You can certainly see the Soros/Brzezinski techniques in theObama ‘revolution’ in the United States. It was the complex and secretivenetwork of Soros foundations and organisations, connected to the intelligenceagencies of the US and Israel, that trained and funded students in the Ukraine,Georgia and elsewhere in the art of mass protest and overthrowing governments.These manufactured protests were sold to the world as ‘peoples’ revolutions’,but it just so happened that when they were over and the old regime was removedthe new leaders were those waiting in the wings all along – the puppets ofSoros, Brzezinski and their associated networks.Obama is just more of the same, a big smile with strings attached, andcontrolled completely by the Illuminati networks that chose him, trained him,sold him and provided his record funding. It was they who kept his manyskeletons under wraps and will continue to do so as long as he jumps to theirbidding (Figure 4). He’s just another Banksters’ moll prostituting himself forfame and power, and that’s why he supported the grotesque bail-out of thebanking system and why he will always put their interests before the people. Hisfinancial advisors are straight from the Wall Street ‘A’ list, including PaulVolker (Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg Group),the head of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987 and Illuminati to hisfingertips. Another, the Zionist Bilderberger Timothy Geithner, was appointed byObama to be his Treasury Secretary. Geithner was the President of the New YorkFederal Reserve Bank, the most powerful in the private ‘Federal’ Reserve cartelthat masquerades as America's 'central bank', and he is a former employee ofboth the Council on Foreign Relations and the notorious Kissinger Associates.Obama's Treasury team locks into the inner circle around the Zionist RobertRubin, the Director and Senior Counselor of Citigroup and co-chairman of theCouncil on Foreign Relations. Rubin was Treasury Secretary to Bill Clinton andwas followed in that post by Larry Summers – another insider appointed toObama’s team of ‘change’. Summers is a fanatical supporter of ‘free trade’(freedom to exploit) and ‘globalisation’ (global dictatorship) and he wrote amemo in 1991, while chief economist to the World Bank, saying that the bankshould dump toxic waste in poor countries because the costs of the ensuingill-health and death would be lower. When the memo was made public, Brazil'sthen-Secretary of the Environment, Jose Lutzenburger, told Summers: 'Yourreasoning is perfectly logical but totally insane … Your thoughts [provide] aconcrete example of the unbelievable alienation, reductionist thinking, socialruthlessness and the arrogant ignorance of many conventional ‘economists’concerning the nature of the world we live in … If the World Bank keeps you asvice president it will lose all credibility. To me it would confirm what I oftensaid … the best thing that could happen would be for the Bank to disappear.’Lutzenburger was dismissed shortly after writing this letter while the horrificSummers was made US Treasury Secretary by Bill Clinton and now he has beenappointed to head the National Economic Council by Mr. 'change', hope' and'believe' Obama. It's all a fairystory. Bloomberg.com [http://Bloomberg.com]reported that the Center for American Progress (CAP), housed just three blocksfrom the White House, has become a major source for policy initiatives for theObama Democratic Party. Who funds the Center for American Progress? GeorgeSoros. It is simply the Neocon Project for the New American Century and theAmerican Enterprise Institute under another name. Those two organisationsdeveloped and dictated the Bush policy of war and suppression and the ‘CAP’ andothers like it will do the same for Obama. The CAP will fit and Obama will wearit.image [../Images/00269.jpg]Figure 4 In fact, except in name and rhetoric, there is no difference in theme betweenthe regimes of Bush and Obama. Bush policy was dictated through Illuminati‘think tanks’ and so is Obama’s. Bush was surrounded by slavish pursuers ofIsraeli interests and so is Obama. Mr. ‘Change’ has pledged his unquestioningsupport for Israel to the point of ‘pass the sick bag’ and his vice-president,Joe Biden, is a vehement Zionist who makes a virtue of saying he will supportIsrael in all circumstances. Obama has appointed the arch Zionist Rahm Emanuelas his chief of staff and another super Zionist Jew, Dennis Ross, to be hisMiddle East Policy advisor. God help the Palestinians. Ross also served in theBill Clinton and Father George Bush administrations. Oh, plenty of ‘change’there, then. Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago-born Congressman, is the son of Benjamin M.Emanuel, who was a member of the murderous Jewish terrorist organisation, Irgun,which helped to bomb and terrorise Israel into existence. The Open Secretswebsite reports that Emanuel was the top House recipient in 2008 for electioncontributions from ‘hedge funds, private equity firms and the largersecurities/investment industry’. Emanuel was also appointed by Bill Clinton tothe board of the mortgage giant Freddie Mac in 2000 and his tenure coincidedwith a stream of scandals and financial irregularities. It famously had to bebailed out by the taxpayer amid the sub-prime mortgage debacle.A close friend of Emanuel is the Chicago-based Zionist, David Axelrod, who ranObama’s election campaign and will no doubt be highly influential in the Obamaadministration. Axelrod is a veteran of Chicago politics, one of the mostcorrupt political systems in the world. He worked for many Chicago mayors in the1990s and on Obama’s senate campaign in 2004. Bill Clinton took his Arkansascabal to Washington when he became president in 1993 and Obama is uploading hisChicago mob and handing them key positions of national power and influence. Andthese guys don’t take prisoners. All of this may be many things, none of thempleasant, but ‘change’ it isn’t.Obama is a monumental fraud who talks a good story, but lives a very differentone. He won his first political office as a state senator in Chicago in 1996,not through the power of his policies, but by coldly abusing the electoralprocess. Instead of running against his opponents and letting the people decide,he had his cronies challenge hundreds of names on the nomination papers of hisDemocratic primary rivals until they were all forced off the ballot bytechnicalities. He then ran unopposed. One of them, Gha-is Askia, says thatObama's behaviour belied his image as a champion of the little guy and crusaderfor voter rights:> ‘Why say you’re for a new tomorrow, then do old-style Chicago politics to> remove legitimate candidates? He talks about honour and democracy, but what> honour is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run> scot-free? Why not let the people decide?’ Why? Because he would probably have lost and Obama isn’t interested in losing byplaying fair. He wants to win by any means necessary. The only voter-right he’sinterested in is the right to vote for him. Obama is a classically corruptmain-chancer spawned from the Chicago political cesspit. His close connections,therefore, to seriously dodgy ‘businessmen’ and fraudsters like the now-jailedslum landlord Tony Rezko are exactly what you would expect. But for now no scaleof evidence will stop the swooning Obama zombies from believing the hype orburst their reality bubble. That is going to take hard experience and it couldtake some time and a lot of disappointment before they are released from theclutches of cognitive dissonance and have to admit to themselves they have beenhad. It is the same for all the black people who voted for what they thought wasthe first black president when, in truth, he is a man in a black maskrepresenting the interests of the white-faced Illuminati cabal, the veryfamilies and networks that ran the slave trade. I don’t want to be the bringerof bad news or the thwarter of dreams, but honesty demands it. The man is atrickster controlled by super-tricksters. A sock puppet controlled by biggersock puppets who serve an even greater and darker evil. To his masters, Obama isjust a means to an end and if it suits them to assassinate him to trigger civilwar and upheaval in the United States then that is what they will do.Oh dear Oprah, how will you cope when reality dawns? But, then, will it ever??image [../Images/00270.jpg]Figure 5: ‘What? You mean you’re not the Lord??’ I can understand the appeal of Obama because people want him to be what heclaims to be, but isn’t. They are sick of the conflict, the corruption, thestruggle we call ‘life’ and they want it all to change. But Obama’s change isillusory and represents only the continued transformation of society in theimage envisaged by Orwell. We will see some apparently good things announced,like the closing of Guantanamo, to give the impression that Obama means what hesays. But keep your eye on the ball and you’ll see how the agenda of the globaltyranny is introduced under the guise of Obama’s ‘hope’, ‘change’, ‘believe’,‘sacrifice’ and ‘coming together’. It could take two years, maybe much more,before cognitive dissonance (lying to yourself) loses it current grip on theminds of the Obama faithful. Until then they will make endless excuses for him(lie to themselves) to keep the ‘dream’ alive.But one day they will have to admit, by the power of the evidence before them,that they bought a dream and got a nightmare.
