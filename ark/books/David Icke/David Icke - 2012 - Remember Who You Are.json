Well, it depends on how it’s used, really. It can be usedabusively and aggressively, but then so can lots of other words that areperfectly acceptable to ‘moral society’; and I defy anyone to come up with abetter response to hitting their thumb with a hammer than:‘Fuuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!!’ It’s a sort of verbal painkiller. It makes mefeel better, anyway. And what if, by some twist of fate, the slang word forsexual intercourse had turned out to be, say, ‘sandwich’, and the word forsomething eaten between two slices of bread had passed from the Latin throughthe Greek, with some Outer Mongolian influence, to become ‘fuck’? We would nowbe asking for a cheese and tomato fuck, heavy on the mayo, and no one wouldflicker an eyelash. But ask for a ‘sandwiching fuck’ and we would be asked toleave the shop. Humans are so funny. So much moralising about a word while atthe same time thinking it perfectly ‘moral’ to pepper-bomb cities full of peopleto protect them from violence. Media organisations in the United States can befined ludicrous amounts of money if anyone says the word ‘shit’ on the radio,yet it’s okay to broadcast the US President announcing that he is going to bombmore children with brown faces to protect their freedom, while asking the peopleto ‘support our troops’ in doing that. Well, support the live troops who canstill serve the mass slaughter and exploitation. Forget about the dead andmaimed troops. They’re really bad for selling the next war and recruiting morebomb fodder. What a distorted sense of ‘morality’ it all is – and there is areason for that. We live in a ‘distortion’. But more of that later. Anyway,where was I? Yes, back to the point. I mean, what is ‘going on’? I’ll settlefor: ‘What the hell is going on?’ as a sort of middle ground, still just on theright side of ‘naughty’, yet still a little risqué to the moral extremists –‘Don’t you say that word in this house or I’ll get the soap,’ and all thatstuff. I am sorry if I upset such people with my use of the word ‘hell’, but, ifI do, well, fuck it! The time is over for pussyfooting around, talking aroundthe point and desperately trying to avert our eyes so that we can’t see theelephant in the living room; or it had better be if we want to live in a worldin any way connected to another and far more important ‘f’-word – Freedom. Weneed to wake up and grow up lightning fast and heads and sand need to partcompany, along with sofas and arses just as quickly (Fig 1). The world is beingbombarded with so many shocks – economic, political, military, geological and soon, and we are hurtling towards, at least at the moment, a global centralisedfascist/communist dictatorship in which the very few are dictating theincreasingly fine details of the lives of the very many. And we have seennothing yet if heads and sand, sofas and arses continue in their currentrelationship. This is what is ‘going on’, but even that is only a part of whatwe need to know.image [../Images/00009.jpg] Figure 1: How we got into this mess REMEMBER, REMEMBER, REMEMBERThe world appears to be so bewilderingly complex that most people find itimpossible to make sense of it. Instead they give up, switch off and concedetheir potential uniqueness to the tramlines of programmed convention. Most don’teven try to make sense of it. They leave the womb and head for the tram station,encouraged by a global system specifically designed to hijack their sense ofself and reality, and by parents who had the same done to them long ago. Theblind led by the very partially sighted (Fig 2). The apparently complex is justthat – apparently. What is ‘going on’ and why nothing is as complex as it seemsat its core is very simple. Well, let’s say simple with one addition. It issimple when you open your mind and become truly conscious. To the closed andprogrammed mind, forget that I said anything about simple. To those in suchprisons of perception, there is no simple. Everything appears complex when youcan’t see how the random is the planned and the strand is just a part of thetapestry. Put this book down now and don’t waste your time if your mind canconceive only of individual ‘things’ with ‘empty’ space in between, and can’tperceive that the cutting edge of possibility is way ahead of anything we aretold is possible. But, if you are opening your mind to consciousness and openingyour eyes to truly ‘see’, or you are prepared to give it a try, then what liesbetween these covers could change your life in ways you never thought possible.I will not change your life – the information will. You will. You already knowall this anyway; you have just forgotten. It is not a case of new knowledge –only remembering what the system has purposely blanked out. Remember, remember,who you really are. I have written the best part of 20 books, and I never knowwhere they are necessarily going to take me when I sit down to start. They takeon a life of their own as I write them, and new insights and leads come as theprocess unfolds. The big books – and some are really big – can take nine monthsfrom start to finish; but I am writing this in the little more than a few weeksbetween two major speaking tours around the world, and so I know already thatthis one is not going to be really big. This also fits with what I am feelingsitting here on day one, and with the reason for writing this at all. I havebeen consciously doing what I do now for well over two decades. The journey hastaken me to more than 50 countries and put before me a mountain ofmulti-levelled, multi-subject information from endless sources and personalexperiences, some nice and some not so nice. This has been communicated in aseries of very detailed books, all-day presentations across the world, DVDs, mywebsite: www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com], Smartphone ‘applications’and in hundreds of videos and interviews circulating on the Internet. There arean estimated 250 million websites and, in 2011, Davidicke.com[http://davidicke.com] entered the top 5,000 most visited in the United Statesand the top 6,500 in the world. The interest in this information is nowfantastic, not least because ever more people are feeling extremely uneasy aboutthe world and where it is going. They are rejecting the official explanationsthat once made sense, but no longer do, and they are looking elsewhere for a fixon what is, well, ‘going on’. So what I am setting out to do here is connect thedots of this apparently complex – and certainly crazy – world to explain what ishappening today and how a stream of events, organisations and people that appearto have nothing to do with each other are, in fact, fundamentally connected.Only when these connections are made will the apparently complex take on a farsimpler persona. The book is aimed at people new to this information to expandthe global numbers who can see through the multi-faceted illusions; but thosewho have been with me for years will find so much for them, too, as the cuttingedge is moved by a gigantic leap.image [../Images/00010.jpg] Figure 2: You are feeling sleeeepy – baa, baa, baa Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) THE ADVENTURE BEGINSI’ll briefly summarise for those new readers how this all started for me and howit plays out to this day. It’s important to know how the information has beencoming to me for more than 20 years before you choose what to accept or not. Iwas born in the city of Leicester in the English Midlands on April 29th, 1952.You would say that we were a poor family, but I never felt deprived becauseeveryone around me was pretty much the same. As a young boy, I would walk withmy mother around the back of the factory where my father worked to pick up hiswages on Thursday lunchtimes to pay for that night’s dinner. This is how tightthings were. On many occasions I hid behind the sofa with my mother when therent man knocked on the door for money we just didn’t have. He would lookthrough the front window when no-one answered, and we’d stay behind the sofauntil she gave the all-clear. As a boy, I was a ‘loner’ and I’d spend longperiods of time by myself, playing, lost in my own little world (Fig 3). Iwasn’t academically successful at school and I didn’t concentrate very well.School, for me, was something to get through. The only nice thing about it wasplaying for the football team (or ‘soccer’ as they call the game in the UnitedStates). I was a goalkeeper – a position that suited my nature. I was part of ateam, yes, but with a very different role to play. Football gave me theconfidence to mix with people more, and I decided at a very early age that Iwanted to be a professional. This looked highly unlikely, until a series of‘coincidences’ and ‘lucky breaks’ put me in the right place, in the right team,at the right time, to sign as a professional with Coventry City Football Club. Ileft school at 15, having not taken, never mind passed, any of the majoracademic exams (thank you, God). I had felt through much of my childhood that Ihad come here to do something in particular, something ‘different’. But, what? Icould never put words to it. There was just something. When I signed forCoventry City I thought that must be it – I have come here to be a footballer.But, no. Nothing like. I developed what was later diagnosed as rheumatoidarthritis within six months of starting my ‘new life’ in professional football.I wasn’t going to give up my dream even with the arthritis, and I played for sixseasons as a professional footballer with ever-worsening pain as it picked offjoint after joint. It’s staggering when I look back. In my last two years in thegame, every daily training session was agonising until my joints had warmed up.In the final year I was in a then successful team called Hereford United, and mywill just drove me on despite the pain (Fig 4). The club had no idea how bad mycondition really was. They would have been looking for another goalkeeper hadthey been aware of the progressing discomfort that I was in. The end (and therehad to be an end as the arthritis spread) came very suddenly when I had justturned 21. I awoke one morning, in that state of sensory crossover half-sleep,and I realised that I couldn’t breathe. I tried to wake my wife, Linda (the mostimportant person in my life to this day), and I realised that I couldn’t move mybody either. I was in a sort of frozen state, unable to move in any way or tobreathe. It was like my consciousness was not in my body. I thought: this is it– I am going to die. Finally, I gasped a breath and my body kicked into life.Well, kind of. Once I breathed and became ‘unfrozen’, I was hit by excruciatingpain in every joint in my body – even the ones unaffected this far. I went tobed a professional footballer and woke up never to play again. A fun time.image [../Images/00011.jpg] Figure 3: So glad to be here. Earth’s a shitty place, I wanna go home image [../Images/00012.jpg] Figure 4: The footballer. Smiling through the daily agony THE ‘PATTERN’I see footballers today earning huge amounts of money – the top ones the bestpart of £200,000 a week – but the most I ever earned as a basic weekly wage infootball was £33. Linda and I were holding on for dear life financially when mycareer ended and the money stopped. It was to stay that way for many more yearsas I pursued my next ambition – journalism. I was interviewed on a livetelevision programme about the end of my football career, and I was so taken bythe buzz and the atmosphere that I said to Linda that night, ‘This is for me.’ Iwas told that the way into television news was via newspaper journalism, and Imanaged to get a job on a tiny weekly newspaper … in my home town of Leicesterof all places. The paper was so awful that no-one else wanted to work there. Itwas called The Leicester Advertiser, and I am pleased to say that it has longsince been put out of its misery. I progressed very quickly through biggernewspapers, to radio, to regional and national television (Fig 5). When I say‘very quickly’, this was a time when I first began to wonder, here and there,not often, if there was some sort of destiny playing out here. But what? I haddecided that I wanted to be a professional footballer, and a series of‘coincidences’, and thereby opportunities, arose to allow that to happen. In mydespair when my football career ended, I had decided that I wanted to be atelevision news and sports presenter and, again, a series of ‘coincidences’, andthereby opportunities, arose to allow that to happen. I had noticed the pattern,but I gave it only brief attention and carried on. But ‘the pattern’ could nolonger be ignored when I decided to enter politics with a then little-knownparty called the Green Party. Another string of ‘coincidences’ led to mebecoming the joint national spokesman within weeks of joining the party as alocal member on the Isle of Wight – off the south coast of England – where Ilive. It was insane that this should happen in that timescale – totallyridiculous – but it did. I was asking seriously by now what was happening withmy life. This was crazy! I have described the details of these endless‘coincidences’ in other books, but it was as though something was opening andclosing doors to guide me through the ‘maze’ of life in a very particular way.But again, what? And why? The answer to the question of ‘why’ would arrive abouta couple of years later; the ‘what’ would take longer. My appointment as anational Green Party spokesman coincided with a lot of mainstream televisionprogrammes in Britain highlighting the gathering damage to wildlife andenvironmental systems in the late 1980s, and this played a major role insecuring the biggest vote in the party’s history at the European elections of1989. Two million people voted for the Green Party – something absolutelyunheard of before. The morning after the result, I found myself facing a packedroom of mainstream journalists and cameramen at a news conference, and I was allover the television news as a politician (Fig 6). I pondered again about whatwas happening to me. I had dreamed my way through school with minimal focus andyet, by the age of 37, I had already been a professional footballer, a newspaperjournalist, a radio journalist, a national television news and sports presenter,and now a national politician. What? How could this be? There was a clearpattern. I would decide that I wanted to do something and the ‘coincidences’ andopportunities then began until it happened. I started to wonder for the firsttime at this point if ‘I’, the conscious ‘me’, was deciding what I wanted to do;or was something else going on here? As Morpheus said to Neo in The Matrixmovie: ‘The answers are coming.’ They duly began to arrive in March 1990.image [../Images/00013.jpg] Figure 5: Hello, good evening and welcome image [../Images/00014.jpg] Figure 6: The politician – but not for long, thank goodness THE ‘PRESENCE’Throughout 1989, something very strange had begun to happen as I went about mywork for BBC television and the Green Party. Whenever I was alone in a room itfelt like I was not alone. There was a ‘presence’ in the room. This became evermore tangible and, one evening in 1990 as I was staying at the Kensington HiltonHotel near the BBC headquarters in London, the presence in the room was soobvious that I actually said out loud: ‘If there is anybody here, will youplease contact me because you are driving me up the wall!’ A few days later, Iwas with my son, Gareth, at a newspaper shop about five minutes from my home.He’s now a big, strapping singer-songwriter and radio host, but he was only alittle boy then. Gareth was inside the shop looking at railway books while I waschatting to somebody outside. I went to the door to tell Gareth we were leaving,when the soles of my feet suddenly started to feel incredibly hot. I also hadthe sense of them being pulled downwards, as if magnets were in the floor. Myfeet wouldn’t move, and, as I stood there utterly bewildered, I heard a ‘voice’,or a very powerful thought, pass through my mind. It said: ‘Go and look at thebooks on the far side.’ I guess, when I think about it, the scene was a bit likeMorpheus in The Matrix movie talking to Neo at his workplace, only without thephone! What was happening? I didn’t know. I just instinctively felt to go withthis and see if it led anywhere. My feet were freed when I moved towards ‘thebooks on the far side’ which I knew were almost entirely made up of cheesyromantic novels. But, in among the tales of tall, dark handsome men andperfectly-formed English Roses, there was one book that was so different itcaught my eye immediately. It was called Mind to Mind and was written by a ladycalled Betty Shine, whose picture was on the front cover (Fig 7). I turned itover to read the blurb and I saw the word ‘psychic’. Betty was a professionalpsychic and ‘hands-on’ healer who wrote a series of books. I wonderedimmediately if she might ‘pick up’ on the ‘presence’ that I had been sensingaround me for the past year. I bought the book, and, after reading it quickly, Icontacted Betty and arranged to meet her. I told her nothing about the presence.I said that I wanted to see if her healing technique could help my arthritis.‘Hands-on’ healing is the exchange and balancing of energy, and not at all the‘mumbo jumbo’ that it is derided to be by the deeply ignorant and academicallyprogrammed. Betty knew nothing about what was happening to me – only that Iwanted to try her healing.image [../Images/00015.jpg] Figure 7: Betty Shine: The face in the newspaper shop I visited Betty four times in all. Nothing happened on the first two occasionsexcept that she did her healing and we chatted about other dimensions ofreality. This is from where genuine psychics glean their information. They tunein to frequencies of reality that are not accessible to the five senses. Thefive senses only connect with a tiny band of frequencies that we call ‘visiblelight’ – the ‘world’ that we see, hear, touch, taste and smell. People lookthrough their eyes (or think they do, as we shall explore) and they believe theyare seeing all that there is to see in the ‘space’ they are observing. Butthey’re not. We see only an infinitesimal fraction of what exists – thefrequency range known as ‘visible light’. The electromagnetic spectrumrepresents about 0.005 per cent of the energy and ‘matter’ that exists in theUniverse, according to some in mainstream science. Others put it higher, but notby much. Visible light, the only frequency range that our decoding system cancurrently ‘see’, is a fraction even of that (Fig 8). Within the same space thatwe live and perceive is also Infinity – all existence – and this interpenetratesour ‘world’ in the same way that radio stations share the same space withoutinterfering with each other (unless they are very close on the dial). If youtune a radio to, say, Radio 1, that’s what you get. When you move the dial toRadio 2 you hear – perceive – that station instead. But Radio 1 doesn’t stopbroadcasting when you are no longer tuned in to it. It goes on broadcasting –existing – in the same space in which you are now listening to Radio 2. It isthe same with our reality. The body’s five senses and its entire geneticstructure is a decoding system. It picks up frequencies within a certain verynarrow band and we perceive that band as the world that we ‘live in’. But allthe other ‘worlds’ and expressions of infinite existence are sharing the samespace. We can’t see them because they are resonating to frequencies that thefive senses cannot pick up, just as you can’t hear Radio 1 when you are tuned toRadio 2 (Fig 9). I said all this on a British television programme in 1991,during a time of enormous ridicule for me, and, 17 years later, in 2008, thefamous American physicist, Dr Michio Kaku, said the same, virtually word forword. You can see the comparison on YouTube in a video headed: ‘Michio KakuConfirms Icke To Be Correct’. It is crucial to appreciate the nature of ourreality to understand what is ‘going on’. Different frequencies don’t normallyinterfere with each other unless they are close on the dial, and it is the samewith the frequency ‘worlds’ of Creation. People experience ‘interference’ fromfrequencies close to ours in the form of ‘ghosts’, for instance, and other‘paranormal’ phenomena. The ‘ghosts’ mostly don’t look ‘solid’ to us because weare not on their ‘station’. Interference from another radio station frequency isnot sharp and clear. The ‘ghosts’ would look as solid as you and I if we were onthe same frequency (not that we are solid, but that’s for later). It is possiblefor entities in other frequency worlds to move in and out of ours usingtechnology, and, for the even more advanced, simply through the power ofconsciousness. Non-human entities and ‘UFOs’ can appear ‘out of nowhere’ anddisappear ‘into nowhere’, or at least it seems that way to the human observer.What actually happens is they enter the frequency range of the human five sensesand suddenly appear to our sight; and when they leave our frequency range theysuddenly ‘disappear’ in our perception. In fact, they have just dipped into therange of frequencies that we are able to decode, and therefore perceive, andhave then left again. Genuine psychics, as opposed to those who claim to be, butaren’t, can tune their higher senses to other frequencies of reality andcommunicate with sources of information that are ‘not of this world’ (Fig 10).This includes those expressions of consciousness that have departed this realityfor frequencies new at what we call ‘death’. There is no death in terms of thereal ‘us’ – consciousness, awareness – only the demise of the body, which is thevehicle that allows us to experience this range of frequencies that we call oureveryday reality.image [../Images/00016.jpg] Figure 8: The tiny frequency band of human perception within the electromagneticspectrum image [../Images/00017.jpg] Figure 9: Creation is an infinite range of interpenetrating frequency ‘worlds’,and the frequency range that we decode becomes our sense of reality. But all theother ‘worlds’ share the same ‘space’, just like radio stations and analoguetelevision channels Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00018.jpg] Figure 10: Other ‘worlds’, or ranges of frequency, can be contacted by genuinepsychics by attuning their minds, or consciousness, to another ‘station’ Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) WE HAVE CONTACTMy third visit to Betty Shine changed my life and set me on a journey that Iwould never have thought possible. But it has happened, and continues to happenever more profoundly. I was sitting up on a medical-type couch while Betty wasdoing energy healing near my left knee. I suddenly felt like a spider’s web wastouching my face, and I immediately recalled reading in her book that when‘spirits’ or other dimensions are trying to make contact it can feel like aspider’s web touching you. I now know that what I was feeling waselectromagnetic energy – the same thing that happens in a large excited crowdwhen people feel the hairs on their neck stand up. This is caused by theaccumulation of electromagnetic energy generated by the crowd. The ‘spider’sweb’ was an electromagnetic connection being locked in between differentfrequency ranges of reality, although I had no idea about that at the time. Ididn’t say anything to Betty about what I was feeling, but 10–15 seconds latershe threw her head back and said, ‘Wow! This is powerful. I’ll have to close myeyes for this one!’ I was sitting there wondering what I had gotten myself into,but I was about to understand why I had felt the ‘presence’ around me for thelast year. Betty said that she was seeing a figure in her mind which was askingher to communicate information to me. ‘They’ said they knew that I wanted themto contact me, but the time had not been right. This was a reference to mesitting on the bed at the Kensington Hilton Hotel saying: ‘If there is anybodyhere, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!’ ButBetty knew nothing about that. There followed a series of messages that seemedbizarre and crazy at the time, but more than two decades later the ones relatingdirectly to me have all happened or are happening. These are some of them: • He is a healer who is here to heal the Earth and he will be world famous. • He will face enormous opposition, but we will always be there to protecthim. • He is still a child, spiritually, but he will be given the spiritualriches. • Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from. They will beour words. • Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times he will be led toknowledge. He was chosen as a youngster for his courage. He has been tested andhas passed all the tests. • He was led into football to learn discipline, but when that was learned itwas time to move on. He also had to learn how to cope with disappointment,experience all the emotions, and how to get up and get on with it. The spiritualway is tough and no-one makes it easy. • He will always have what he needs [this could have been ‘wants’], but nomore.A week later, I went back to Betty and more information came through: • One man cannot change the world, but one man can communicate the messagethat will change the world. • Don’t try to do it all alone. Go hand in hand with others, so you can pickeach other up as you fall. • He will write five books in three years. • Politics is not for him. He is too spiritual. Politics is anti-spiritualand will make him very unhappy. • He will leave politics. He doesn’t have to do anything. It will happengradually over a year. • There will be a different kind of flying machine, very different from theaircraft of today. • Time will have no meaning. Where you want to be, you will be.The figure that communicated these words (a projection from another frequencyrange into Betty’s mind) took a Chinese form and said that ‘Socrates is withme’. Socrates (469–399 BC) was the Greek philosopher who taught Plato, and atthe age of 70 he was charged with heresy and corruption of local youth. Hecarried out his own death sentence by drinking hemlock. There is a long list ofgreat quotes by Socrates, including one that is perfect for this book and mywork in general: ‘Wisdom is knowing how little we know.’ These messages werecommunicated electromagnetically to Betty Shine, who, like all true psychics,decoded the information into words. An English psychic decodes into English, anItalian into Italian, and so on. The communications are not sent in words, butin electromagnetic ‘thought-form’. This is decoded like a radio or an analoguetelevision decodes information encoded in broadcast frequencies into: ‘Hello,you are listening to Radio ABK,’ and: ‘Good evening, here is the news,’ orwhatever. The process is so simple, but it is dismissed by the deeply controlledand ignorant mainstream of what passes for ‘science’ which is utterly cluelessabout the real nature of our reality that I will be explaining in these pages.BYE BYE, ‘REAL’ WORLDSo here I was, a national television presenter with the BBC and spokesman forthe Green Party, being told that I was going out onto a world stage amid greatopposition and ‘They’, whoever ‘They’ were, would always be there to protect me.It was all very confusing. What did ‘healing the Earth’ mean? And I would ‘writefive books in three years’ about what exactly? But something within me just knewI had to go with this and see where it led. Things soon began to move veryquickly. A few months later, my contract with the BBC was not renewed, and Istepped back from my work with the Green Party. I knew that one day I would gopublic with all this and I didn’t want to cause them damage with a programmedelectorate. I also knew by now that politics was irrelevant, anyway. I told ahandful of people in the Green Party what had happened to me and ‘David’s gonecrazy!’ rumours began to circulate. So much for the ‘different’ and‘enlightened’ Green politics. I can tell you from experience that it is only theold politics under another name, and its obsession with selling and exploitingthe manipulated nonsense about human-caused ‘global warming’ (renamed ‘climatechange’ after temperatures began to fall) will ultimately destroy itscredibility altogether. My life became an amazing series of synchronistic‘coincidences’, experiences and happenings from the time of the firstcommunications in March 1990. This was leading me to knowledge and informationin the form of people, books, documents, a few more psychics, and personalexperiences. An unseen force was handing me pieces to a vast puzzle, and I amstill learning how truly colossal it is more than 20 years later. The puzzle isstill expanding, today faster than ever, and, as they say, the rabbit hole goesvery deep. The scale of interconnected information is so mind-blowinglyenormous, the story so seemingly endless, and the subject areas so numerous,that the communication of the ‘clues’ has had to be done in a systematic way.Layer has been added to layer as I have gone deeper and deeper into the rabbithole. The themes have been consistent all along, but the detail has changed hereand there, and has been added to and tweaked, as my mind has expanded and moredetail has been put before me with the passage of what we call ‘time’. There areso many smokescreens of false information to steer through, too. In the end, thethemes are more important than the fine detail. People can forget detail, butremember themes. To understand and do something about what we are facing doesnot require us to know someone’s collar size or coffee preference. My challengehas been to keep my mind open to all possibility and not to dismiss informationor insight simply because it is way outside of the ‘norm’; and to have thedetermination to communicate that information knowing the ridicule and abusethat I would face, at least at first, from the public and brainless media. Butthat hasn’t really been much of a ‘challenge’ in the sense that I have neverdismissed anything throughout my life purely on the basis of it being differentfrom what most people can believe.What was about to happen has since helped me to ignore ridicule and abuse – itis now water off a duck’s rear end. I spent the rest of 1990 travelling andwriting my first book. I called it Truth Vibrations after a vibrational changethat ‘They’ told me was coming that would transform life on Earth and the humanperception of reality. I will explain more about this as we go along, butessentially I was told that the Truth Vibrations, a fundamental change in thevibrational construct of our reality, would have three main effects: (1) Theywould act like an alarm clock, or a click of the hypnotist’s fingers to ease,sometimes snap, humanity out of its trance-like state, its amnesia. People wouldremember what they had been manipulated to forget about the true nature of selfand the ‘world’; (2) All that had been hidden from humanity in terms of what hasbeen happening without their knowledge would be revealed. We would see behindthe ‘wizard’s curtain’, as in the highly symbolic Wizard of Oz; (3) The Earth’senergy fields and vibrational structure would have to synchronise, as withhumans’, with the changing energetic resonance of the reality, and this wouldbring an increase in severe weather and geological activity such as earthquakesand volcanoes. We should always keep in mind, however, that the technologyexists to manipulate the weather and geological activity, as I will beexplaining. Far from all extreme weather and geological happenings are‘natural’. There was no evidence whatsoever when I was told all this in 1990that there was going to be some mass ‘awakening’; or that what has been going onwith regard to a Hidden Hand controlling world events throughout history wascoming to light. But it is clear today that both are happening, and on anincreasingly global scale. It was a very lonely road when I started out, butthere has been an explosion in recent years of conspiracy researchers andresearch material; and incredible numbers of people are opening their minds to anew perception of self and the world compared with just a few years ago, letalone in 1990 when I was told all this was coming. What’s more, it is growing bythe day.image [../Images/00019.jpg] Figure 11: Sillustani in Peru. As I walked around the ruins, I had no idea thatthe clock was counting down to a ‘new’ David with an incredible experience in astone circle close by. Talk about ‘life changing’. Everything changed. PLUGGED IN TO THE ‘MAINS’I finished writing Truth Vibrations by the end of that year and, when it wentoff to be printed and published, I suddenly had a tremendous urge to go to Peru.I didn’t know anything about Peru, except that I had seen the football team playin the World Cup a few times; but there was this feeling of ‘I must go to Peru’.I was seeing ‘Peru’ crop up again and again in a variety of places, from travelagency window displays, bookshops and television documentaries to name a few. Ihad to go there. I knew that. I had no idea why, though. I have described indetail in other books what happened to me there, but, in short, I had anincredible series of daily experiences and ‘coincidences’ that eventually led meto a place called Sillustani, an ancient Inca site in the countryside about 80minutes’ drive from the city of Puno (Fig 11). It is on a hill with a lagoon onthree sides and the area is encircled by mountains way off in the distance. MyPeruvian guide who was showing me around the country had booked us into a hotelin Puno called The Sillustani. It had pictures of the place all over the wallsand as soon as I saw them I knew I had to go – the intuitive urge was so great.I hired a little tourist bus with the guide and a driver, and off we went.Sillustani is beautiful and I enjoyed looking around the ruins and seeing themagnificent views, but when it came time to leave I was disappointed. As lovelyas it was, my experience there did not even nearly match the urge I’d had to go.I returned to the bus and headed back for Puno, but not for long. I was gazingthrough the window in a semi-daydream state. A few minutes down the road, asmall hill, or mound, to my right, caught my attention. All I could hear in myhead as I looked was: ‘Come to me, come to me, come to me.’ Now a bloody hillwas talking to me! Whatever next? I asked the driver to stop and said I wantedto walk up the hill for a minute or two. It turned out to be rather longer. WhenI reached the top, I found myself looking at an ancient stone circle which Ihadn’t been able to see from the road (Fig 12). I walked into the centre under asunny, cloudless sky and looked back to Sillustani and the distant mountains.Suddenly, my feet began to feel incredibly hot again as they had in thenewspaper shop near my home almost a year earlier, only this time with fargreater intensity. It felt once more like magnets were pulling my feet to theground. A drill-like sensation started in the top of my head and I felt energyflow down from my head through my feet to the ground. Another flow was comingthe other way. My arms stretched out at 45 degrees either side of my headalthough I had made no conscious decision to do that. They would stay there forsomething like an hour, although time did not exist in my reality from now untilit was over. A ‘voice’ (a decoded electromagnetic communication) passed throughmy mind very clearly that said: ‘They will be talking about this moment ahundred years from now’; and then: ‘It will be over when you feel the rain.’ Thelatter seemed ridiculous given that a piercingly hot sun shone from a skywithout a single cloud. The energy passing through me increased and increaseduntil my body was shaking. It felt like an incredibly powerful electrical forcewas zipping through me in each direction – which I now know it was. I keptmoving in and out of my conscious mind, as you do when you are driving a car andyou can’t remember where the last few miles went. The subconscious has beendoing the driving. When I came back to conscious awareness on one occasion, Inoticed a light grey mist over the distant mountains, and the mist soon grewdarker. Clearly it was raining quite heavily over there and I watched the stormmove towards me very quickly. Weather forecasters talk about a ‘front’ comingover. Well, this was a ‘front’ of billowing clouds with the rain moving towardsme in an almost perfect straight line. It was like a curtain was being drawnacross the sky. Eventually, the clouds obscured the sun and, in the end, Iwatched the wall of stair-rod rain coming towards me. People wouldunderstandably say that it was too far-fetched if you included a scene like thisin a story or movie. But it happened. I was instantly drenched as the rain hitme and the energy flow immediately stopped. I had not felt the pain from holdingmy arms aloft continuously up to this point, but now my shoulders started tofeel the painful consequences. My legs were like those of a newly-born giraffe.Energy was pouring from my hands and feet. I was like a walking, talking columnof electricity. I went back to the bus and held a big quartz crystal to diffusethe energy a little, but it was to resonate from my feet for the next 24 hours.image [../Images/00020.jpg] Figure 12: My return to Sillustani in 2012 and the place where my life changedforever image [../Images/00021.jpg] Figure 13: The major human ‘chakras’, or vortices, which resonate to differentcolour frequencies and connect the ‘physical’ body to other levels of self andthe wider reality Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) KUNDALINI KIDI had no idea at the time what had happened to me in that stone circle. But I donow. Many things happened in fact. The energy burst the energy/consciousnessbubble that most people live in, for reasons I will be explaining. Anelectromagnetic communication channel was also established between me and‘They’. Information, concepts and insights from other levels of reality began topour through that connection into my ‘human’ mind. There followed a seriouslychallenging transitional period of about three or four months, from February toMay 1991, when I didn’t know what was going on. With hindsight, I can see thatit was like pressing too many keys on a computer too quickly and the computer‘freezes’. It can’t process so much data at one time. I was struck by a tidalwave of information when the connection was made and everything had to settledown before I could start to process the data. It was akin to a dam bursting,causing great upheaval and turbulence until the water settles into its newsituation. This was what was basically happening in my mind. I now know thatwhat happened in the stone circle triggered an absolutely enormous ‘Kundalini’experience and my ‘chakra’ system burst open for all that information to comeflooding in. It was like trying to ride a mental and emotional version of abucking bronco. ‘Chakra’ is an ancient Sanskrit word meaning ‘wheel of light’.Chakras are vortices that connect the body to other levels of mind and awarenessin what is called the ‘auric field’ (Fig 13). These are the seven main chakras:(1) The crown chakra is on top of the head, and it was through here that theenergy came and went during my experience in the stone circle. (2) The third-eyechakra is in the centre of the forehead and connects to the pineal and pituitaryglands in the brain that comprise the ‘third eye’ or ‘psychic sight’. (3) Thethroat chakra is the vortex for creativity and communication. (4) The heartchakra is in the centre of the chest and if this vortex is open it connects usto far higher levels of awareness. (5) The solar plexus chakra is located in the‘belly’ and is directly connected to feelings and emotions. This is why we feelstrong emotions such as fear and dread in this area. (6) The sacral chakra islocated just beneath the navel and relates to sexuality and reproduction. (7)The base chakra is at the base of the spine, and it grounds us in this realityas well as being the location of the kundalini, or ‘coiled snake’. This is theenergy which, when released, shoots up the central nervous system opening allthe vortex points and pours through the top of the head to connect us with‘enlightenment’, or far more advanced levels of awareness. This is what happenedto me during my experience in Peru, and this is why I didn’t know what day itwas for a while.MASS RIDICULEUnfortunately, or rather fortunately from the point of view of my owndevelopment, soon after I returned to Britain in this ‘transitional state’, mybook, Truth Vibrations, was published and I was interviewed by the nationalmedia. I was subjected to fantastic levels of ridicule that few people couldhave experienced at such ongoing intensity. This reached a peak when I appearedon a live prime-time television chat show hosted by Terry Wogan, the best-knowntelevision personality in Britain at the time. I was dressed in turquoise – acolour I had an urge to wear all the time at this point – and around 15 minuteslater all bridges to my old life were burned and trashed (Fig 14). There was nogoing back now. Not that, for a second, I wanted to go back, despite the way mylife was falling apart. My life was crashing so that a new one could emerge,although I didn’t know that then. Terry Wogan didn’t cover himself in glory theway he played to a laughing audience to enhance his own perceived image, but, tobe fair, he was faced with a guy going through the most monumentaltransformative experience. Even I didn’t know what was happening to me and I amnot surprised that Wogan didn’t, especially as he’s not the most open minded ofpeople. He interviewed me again many years later and the outcome was verydifferent. You can see both interviews on YouTube. When faced with the scale ofpublic ridicule that came my way for years after the Wogan show – and still doesfrom the juvenile mainstream media – you can either run away and hide or comeback stronger. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, as they say. The titleof one of my early books, I Am Me, I Am Free, sums up the way I chose to go.Mass ridicule was an experience that set me free from the fear and, therefore,the lifetime limitations of the mind and emotional prison that the overwhelmingmajority of people live in worldwide: the fear of what other people think. Themasses that succumb to this psychological fascism are not living or speakingtheir own unique truth or expressing their own unique self. They are livingwithin prison walls built by what they believe is acceptable to those aroundthem – their parents, schoolmates, friends, colleagues, people down the pub, or,if they are a public figure, the ‘media’. Sod that! I was not having it, and ifpeople have a problem with what I am then that describes the situationperfectly. They have the problem. I don’t. The irony of the ridicule in theyears that followed the Wogan show is that they have been ridiculing ‘someone’who only existed for three or four months in 1991. The computer ‘unfroze’ whenthat transitional period was over and people I knew were saying to me: ‘Ithought you were supposed to have gone mad – you are just the bloke I used toknow.’ Well, it may have seemed like that, but I wasn’t. Yes, ‘David’ was‘back’, but it wasn’t the same David. I saw the world in a totally different wayand what I couldn’t see before was now blindingly obvious. My conscious journeyhad begun, and there would be many more ‘Davids’ as the layers of the onion havebeen peeled and programs deleted. I\"m sure there will be many more, too.image [../Images/00022.jpg] Figure 14: ‘Er, what’s my name, where am I?’ ALL MEANT TO BEI can see from today’s perspective that my life has been perfect right from thestart as a preparation for what I came here to do. What seemed like randomevents before the conscious ‘activation’ in 1990 were giving me the experiencesand skills that I would need for what my conscious mind did not know was coming.But ‘They’ did, and so did subconscious levels of my multi-levelled awareness.My experience in football demanded dedication to reach a target, and playingmost of my career with the constant pain of rheumatoid arthritis triggered anever-give-up determination to go on, no matter what. Journalism gave me theskills to write succinctly and to present the apparently complex in simple ways.It also showed me that any connection between the mainstream media and tellingthe truth about the world is purely coincidental most of the time. If you sawthe average newsroom at work in newspapers, radio or television, you would neverbelieve a word they told you ever again. Television showed me what a lie factorythat is, too, and gave me a public profile so that when I said what I did afterPeru it would not be ignored – a vital aspect of the story when you arecommunicating suppressed information. My period in the Green Party showed methat politics is an irrelevance to changing anything for the better and thatdifferent names and colours do not mean different political methods ofoperation. The Green Party is a classic example. It also allowed me to see thatpoliticians who appear to be opposing each other in public are doing anythingbut in private. The mass ridicule after the Wogan show cleared me of any fear ofwhat other people thought of me, and so freed me to go with the information andnot censor and tailor it for conventional belief. This was essential. It doesrather help not to care what people think or say about you when you are talkingabout shape-shifting reptilian entities and saying the Moon is not ‘real’ in thesense of it being a ‘natural body’ (Fig 15). When people look at their own livesthey will see patterns that connect the apparently unconnected. Life is not asrandom as they think it is. When the patterns reveal continually-repeatingcycles of behaviour and experience they are telling you something veryimportant: You are in a mind-prison. Once you know that, acknowledge that anddecide you don’t want to be there anymore, you can do something about the cause– you. One of the messages that I was given through a psychic in 1990 said:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [../Images/00023.jpg] Figure 15: Different essential steps on the same journey-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- > Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only> have to follow the clues … We are guiding you along a set path. It was all> arranged before you incarnated. This is what I have clearly experienced since I was a child, and when I look atthe ‘parts’ of my life I can see that they are all the same seamless journey.That includes both the experiences I have liked and those I have not liked atall. Life often gives us our greatest gifts brilliantly disguised as our worstnightmares. These experiences might not be very pleasant, but they can make uswiser and more knowledgeable. I had two people come into my life at virtuallythe same time who together have been a horror story, and quite the biggestchallenge that I have had to my work, health, emotions and finances while bothclaim to be the very epitome of ‘love, peace, and kindness’. But the experiencemade me stronger, wiser and more aware of many things, not least to see into the‘mind’ of the heart-closed, empathy-deleted, me, me, me mentality that operatesat every level of human society. I saw in their self-obsession the attitudesthat make the world what it has become. So it wasn’t a ‘mistake’; it was thegift of experience. These two people had an experience in the same way that theycan potentially employ to discover what it takes to be kind, unselfish, haveempathy, wisdom and a sense of fairness. I won’t be holding my breath with thispair, but, hey, life is forever, and the opportunity to change is forever. Twoother messages that I was given by ‘They’ in 1990 have played out down to theletter: ‘Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from … Theywill be our words’; and: ‘Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other timeshe will be led to knowledge.’ This has been happening since the moment I heardthose words in Betty Shine’s front room. First, an insight comes to me and thensolid ‘five sense’ information starts to flow my way in the form of people,experiences and information from endless sources. I now know the process verywell. I have long since learned to trust it after what I was told would happendid happen. It has reached the point where what I have written in my books overthe years is now playing out on the television news. Few were interested in whatI had to say for a long time, and I would speak to mostly empty rooms. In 1996,I travelled America for three months researching and talking to handfuls ofpeople. Just eight turned up when I spoke near Chicago, and I travelled to NewEngland to speak in someone’s lounge to even fewer. There were many times when Iwondered why I bothered and where it was all going. What was the point? Butsomething inside drove me on despite all the frustrations and the many financialchallenges that came. I was aware of this ‘something’ when the human ‘me’ wasdying inside during the first Wogan interview. I heard a ‘voice’ speaking to mewhile I was sitting there on live television. It was saying: ‘Don’t worry,everything’s fine; this is leading somewhere.’ And it has. You can’t unhearsomething, and it is so important to speak your truth no matter what thereaction of others. If what you say has validity it will eventually be shown tobe so; but that process cannot happen if you stay silent out of fear of theconsequences. From the turn of this century, and especially after 9/11, theinterest in my work has soared. People all over the world are starting to seethrough the lies told to justify wars of conquest and mass slaughter, and imposea global Orwellian State. I have gone from talking to next to no-one toaddressing audiences of thousands. This is so even when what I say has to besimultaneously translated into another language over the eight or nine hoursthat I am connecting the dots and revealing the picture. I still have to pinchmyself now and then to believe that it is happening; but it is precisely what Iwas told would happen in 1990. There is so much more to come, too (Fig 16). Theawakening I was told was coming is beginning to impact on the perception ofmulti-millions, and it is going to progress faster and faster as the TruthVibrations tease open human minds. It is not the majority yet, or even nearlyso, but compared with when I started out the numbers are incredible and I knowit is a global phenomenon from my almost constant travel around the world.image [../Images/00024.jpg] Figure 16: A tough journey but, oh, so worth the pain and effort. Speaking inTimes Square, New York, in 2010 Courtesy of Paul Lomax Photography © 2010 THE ‘FUTURE’ IS HEREEver more people are looking at the world anew in the light of the extraordinarylevels of control and imposition that I have been saying were coming for overtwo decades. Detailed surveillance of human life is gathered from satellites inspace; from cameras all over our towns, cities and road systems; fromremotely-controlled flying cameras; from mobile phones and computers; fromcredit cards and ‘loyalty’ cards; from iris scanning; and from many othermethods we don’t even know about yet. Our food and drink is poisoned withchemical cocktails known as ‘additives’ – and food and drink aimed at childrenis the worst of all. We have genetically-modified food that is designed togenetically modify us, and poisonous fluoride in our drinking water, whichre-wires the brain just as food ‘additives’ do. Fluoride was put into thedrinking water at the Nazi concentration camps to make the inmates docile.Little children are being subjected to up to 30 (and growing) vaccinationsbefore the age of two while their immune systems are still forming. Theirnatural defences will never be what they were meant to be once that happens. TheBritish government is talking about adding yet another vaccine for hepatitis Bto all the others. The Hidden Hand-controlled World Health Organization andBritish Medical Association say this should happen without delay. I bet they do.Adults, too, are being subjected to an ever-increasing array of toxic chemicalshite called vaccinations which damage them mentally, emotionally andphysically. Compulsory vaccinations are on the agenda of the Control System. Thepolice are becoming more like the military every day with the ever-expanding useof guns and Tasers that give often moronic people in uniform the chance tounleash 55,000 volts of electricity at targets who are no threat to them.Peaceful protestors are being scattered by excruciatingly painful soundtechnology, while governments doing this say they must bomb other countries toprotect the right to protest peacefully. Children are being born in those bombedcountries with severe birth defects because of all the depleted uranium on theland and in the air from the weapons dropped on or fired at them. We are beingsubjected to multiple sources of radiation that are increasing all the time andthis is not by coincidence, but by design. There are mobile phones andcommunication masts; the wireless Internet; microwave cookers; irradiated foodwith ‘safe’ levels (they never were) continually being raised. ‘Low-energy’lightbulbs are being forced upon people as bans of the alternatives arejustified by the Big Lie about human-caused ‘global warming’. Scientists, nevermind personal experience, have confirmed that they give off toxic chemicals anddangerous levels of radiation. Boarding a plane increasingly involves the choiceof being irradiated or sexually molested. Frequent flyers going throughfull-body scanners are going to pay dearly for the cumulative effect (Fig 17).Then there are the nuclear disasters like the one at Fukushima in Japan whichhas been pouring catastrophic amounts of radiation into the seas and globalatmosphere. At the same time, holes are being punched into the ionosphere, inthe upper atmosphere, by the weather-changing, earthquake-causing technologyknown as HAARP. This is controlled by the American military in Alaska andconnects with similar technology around the world. Those holes are allowingcosmic radiation to breach the Earth’s defences that would normally protect us.The food chain is being hijacked by a few controlled-by-the-same-peoplecorporations while small farmers, and even back-yard food growers, are beingtargeted to give the food and biotech cabal a monopoly on where we get our foodand drink and what is in it. A sinister scam called Codex Alimentarius (Latinfor ‘food book’ or ‘food code’) was set up by Nazis jailed for war crimes andthe aim is to stop the effective use of food supplements and natural medicinesby those who have a mind of their own. The ‘education’ system has always beenthere to program the minds of children and young people with a perception ofself and the world that suits the agenda of the global controllers; but theprogramming is getting ever more extreme to dumb down the younger generationswho are being prepared for life as tomorrow’s adult slaves (Fig 18). Theextraordinary use of mind-altering drugs on young people at younger and youngerages is designed to suppress any independent thought. Most of the time the‘problems’ they are supposed to be ‘treating’, as with the bogus ‘AttentionDeficit Disorder’, display precisely the same behaviour symptoms as those causedby food and drink additives. Of course they do. One is causing the other. ‘Go ondear, drink your Coke.’image [../Images/00025.jpg] Figure 17: What are we doing allowing ourselves and our children to be eitherirradiated or sexually molested before we board a plane image [../Images/00026.jpg] Figure 18: ‘Hey, teacher – leave those kids alone’ Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) We are also being deluged by constantly-passed legislation to dictate the verydetail of our lives – what we can do, say, even think. Much of this is comingfrom centralised and dictatorial non-elected dark-suits such as the EuropeanCommission and the faceless handlers of the US President (it doesn’t matterwhich one; it’s the same with all of them). They are seeking, as I write, togive the president, even narcissistic idiots like Boy Bush and Obama, the rightto declare war on anyone, at any time, without the already muted and neuteredrabble on Capitol Hill having any say at all. We are back to Caesar in ancientRome, and that’s very appropriate as we shall see. We have also had the creationof a ‘Super Committee’, or ‘Super Congress’, a small group of politiciansusurping what is left (little) of American ‘democracy’. It consists of sixDemocrats and six Republicans with the president having the deciding vote and,in effect, this makes the rest of Capitol Hill irrelevant to the decision-makingprocess. Obama has established a panel of ten state governors – the ‘Council ofGovernors’ – which he selects to ‘review’ the National Guard, homeland defenseand the coordination and integration of state and federal military activities inthe United States. For the latter, read the military taking over domestic lawenforcement. The centralisation of power is now incredible – especially in thehands of the president. America calls itself a ‘free’ country (it’s not) and a‘democracy’ (which doesn’t mean freedom) and yet it gives astonishing power overits affairs to one man, the president, who is, himself, always controlled by theHidden Hand that I have been exposing all these years. We have ‘FEMA Camps’ inthe United States run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and these arenothing less than concentration camps waiting for the dissidents and the‘listed’ if we allow the global military takeover to happen. The same programmeis happening in other countries. Anyone who thinks I am making this up – I wishI was. Put ‘United States’, ‘FEMA Camps’ and ‘concentration camps’ into a searchengine and see the pictures and official documents that you can find on theInternet. The banking cartel, or ‘Big Banking’, is controlled by the same peoplethat control Big Government, Big Media, Big Biotech, Big Food, Big Oil, and soon, and it has crashed the world economy while paying itself stupendous bonuses.This happens despite the fact that taxpayers who bailed out the banking systemare now losing their homes and basic financial necessities to the same banksthat caused the problem and to governments imposing vicious austerity programmesbecause, they say, of what they have given to the banks. In comes theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) or the European Central Bank (ECB) whengovernments get into a financial mess for bailing the banks. They offer thegovernments even more debt to bail them out and, in effect, take control of thecountry. It is worth noting, therefore, as I have been showing in my books forso long, that the IMF, ECB and other institutions of control such as the WorldBank, World Trade Organization and World Health Organization, are controlled,and were indeed created, by the same network of families. These very muchinclude the House of Rothschild and the Rockefellers, and they own and controlBig Banking, Big Government, Big Media, Big Biotech, Big Food, Big Oil … you getthe picture. These same families engineer wars and lend governments the ‘money’(non-existent ‘money’ called ‘credit’) to fight them by purchasing weapons fromarmament companies which they also own. They then lend more ‘money’ (credit) torebuild the devastated infrastructure caused by the war and to re-arm for thenext one. This has been going on for centuries and, in this way and others, theyhave secured ownership of the world. That includes governments and nations whichwe are told are controlled by ‘the people’. When I say ‘families’, I am actuallytalking about a network of ancient bloodlines that have weaved themselvesthrough history under different names. They have different genetics and originto the rest of humanity, as I will be explaining. The bloodlines manipulate andcontrol through a global secret-society network that many collectively call the‘Illuminati’, or ‘Illuminated Ones’ – illuminated into knowledge that they aredesperate to keep from the rest of us. This is who I mean when I refer to the‘Illuminati bloodlines’. It was these same bloodline families, through theiragencies in government and the military, such as the CIA, British Intelligenceand the Israeli (Rothschild) Mossad, who were behind the engineered terroristattacks on 9/11. This, in turn, was used to advance and justify their agenda forwars of acquisition in Afghanistan and Iraq, and to target other countries ontheir wish-list using their age-old technique of demonise and invade.The mainstream media is also owned by the same cabal. Its role is to tell thepublic the version of events that the owners of the media want people tobelieve, in order to hide what is really happening. These lies and fake coverstories issue from the lips of the power structure through puppets like Bush andObama, and the lies are then repeated as truth by ‘journalists’ who are employedbecause they are deeply uninformed and don’t know their arse from the middle oftheir arm when it comes to what is really happening in the world they aresupposed to be ‘reporting’. The official (cover) story about 9/11 could be takenapart by a moron it’s so ridiculous. But there has been no investigation of thefacts worth the name by the mainstream media worldwide. The authorities releasethe cover stories and the media repeats them unquestioned. They become officialhistory through constant repetition while any real journalists that expose thelies are dismissed by the anything-but-journalists as ‘conspiracy theorists’.This is how people like Piers Morgan, Larry King and their ilk get the big jobswith organisations like CNN. They are safe because they are clueless about theway the world works and so they don’t ask the telling questions of those inpower. Morgan claims to have been a journalist for 25 years, when he hasn’t beena real one for 25 seconds. CNN sacked presenter, Lou Dobbs, when he began askinghighly pertinent questions about what was happening in America. Cenk Uygur, apresenter with cable news channel MSNBC, left his job after efforts to suppresshis right to challenge the government. An executive told him: ‘People inWashington are concerned about your tone.’ The executive said that ‘outsidersare cool, but we’re not outsiders, we’re insiders. We are the establishment’.Cooperation between major media organisations and the CIA has been welldocumented over the years and the same happens in the UK and other countries,with the media working in concert with intelligence agencies. Watergatejournalist Carl Bernstein wrote an article for Rolling Stone in 1977 entitled‘The CIA and the Media’. He said: > Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were William> Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System, Henry Luce of Time Inc., Arthur> Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times, Barry Bingham Sr. of the Louisville> Courier-Journal, and James Copley of the Copley News Services. > Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include the American> Broadcasting Company, the National Broadcasting Company, the Associated Press,> United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard,> Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the> old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald-Tribune. By far the most> valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the> New York Times, CBS and Time Inc. The BBC is a fundamentally controlled organisation with a long line of editorialcensorship and strict rules on stories being ‘signed off’ before being allowedto air. This includes an ‘Editorial Policy’ that goes under the Orwellian nameof ‘EdPol’. All BBC staff and independent production companies working for theBBC are forced to undergo mandatory ‘EdPol’ training. Even when the outrageouslies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and so many others, are exposedby events, the zombie media goes on repeating the next lie as truth with noquestioning or investigation. What a head-shaker it was to see the truly, trulyludicrous story about the long-dead Osama bin Laden being killed again in the‘US raid on the compound’ in Pakistan in 2011. Excuse me, where’s the body? Er,immediately buried at sea. Where are the pictures of the body? Er, too gruesometo release. And so it went on, lie after lie after lie. But what did the‘journalistic’ Piers Morgans do? Repeated the official story as if it was true.‘Pathetic’ is not the word (Fig 19).image [../Images/00027.jpg] Figure 19: Look into my screeeeeen This is what is ‘going on’. What appear to be random events and changes insociety are actually part of a gigantic conspiracy to enslave humanity in aglobal fascist/communist Orwellian nightmare. The bloodlines want to impose aworld government, a world central bank, a single world electronic currency, anda world army forcing its will upon a drugged, mind-controlled and microchippedrace of human robots and computer terminals that have every facet of their livesunder constant control and surveillance. Not possible? It could never happen? Itis happening – minute by minute every day all over the world as this hiddenagenda plays out. It is exactly what I was told would happen at the turn of the1990s and I have been guided to uncover and expose ever since. The EuropeanUnion, a new Soviet Union, is the most advanced of the second layer of globalcontrol that is planned to include an American Union, Pacific Union and AfricanUnion (already in place); and nation states are due to end and be divided intoregions to dilute any unified challenge to the power structure above them.OH, BUT THERE’S MOREEven this is only one level of what is ‘going on’. The pieces in the puzzlehanded to me in the early years after Peru were all about the five-sense levelof the conspiracy – the realm that we consciously experience every day. It wasabout the plan to impose world control and a global police state, and thatinformation continues to come to me all the time. But from the latter part ofthe 1990s another level was added – the fact that this network of ‘human’bloodline families are actually the middle men and women for non-human masterstaking reptilian and other forms that operate mostly beyond the human frequencyrange. People need to open their minds big-time. They will never get close toseeing what is ‘going on’ if they stay within the extreme limitations ofperception and possibility that human society is systematically programmed toaccept. Possibility is actually infinite, and humans have been encased by designin a sense of the possible the size of a pea. Suppressing the sense of thepossible becomes the suppression of the experience of the possible. What wedon’t believe is possible we don’t try to do, and it also opens the way for masscontrol using technology and other techniques that those subjected to suchcontrol and manipulation deny can be happening because ‘that’s not possible’.Oh, but it is. Human potential operating inside the ‘pea’ can’t do it, butothers can and they are. The world is not just a little bit different to whathumanity thinks it is – it is nothing like they think it is. The puzzle piecesadded another level soon after the start of the new century – the illusorynature of ‘physical’ reality. It was now that pennies dropped by the million asI saw how the rabbit hole fits together from this perspective. While I waswriting my recent book, Human Race Get Off Your Knees, I was led to realise thatthe Moon is not a natural satellite of the Earth and that it is broadcastingfrequencies at this planet which are acting as a frequency fence to limit therange of reality we can perceive, in much the same way that the Chinese computersystem is firewalled to stop the people accessing large parts of the Internetthat the rest of us can see (at least for now). Frequencies beamed at us fromthe Moon are also feeding us a fake reality that is the same in principle as theone symbolised in The Matrix movie trilogy. This means that we are not seeingthings that we would otherwise see and we are seeing things that aren’t reallythere. I call this fake reality the Moon Matrix, and since my last book waspublished the synchronicity of experience and information has pointed mepowerfully towards Saturn and its influence on life on Earth in league with whatthe Moon is doing. Saturn is the key, and I will be putting the pieces togetheras we proceed. The compelling research about the – at least on one level –electrical nature of the Universe has provided many answers to how informationis communicated and how it can be ‘hacked’ in the way I have described.You really do need a very open and fluid mind – or rather Consciousness – if youare to ‘get it’. Fortunately that is happening with a fast-increasing number ofpeople. We are seeing an exponential curve of ‘enlightenment’ emerge from thedepths of intergenerational ignorance, and the suppression and control of ourperception. The Truth Vibrations, which artist Neil Hague and I symbolise as alion, are doing what I was told they would do, and we are indeed living inextraordinary times (Fig 20). The ‘masters’ of a dying epoch of control andexploitation seek to retain their power in the face of a mass awakening thatthey knew was coming and have long prepared for – hence we are seeing theextreme levels of control and imposition at the very time humanity is emergingfrom its Big Sleep. There are going to be amazing happenings at every level – onEarth, the Sun and in the ‘Heavens’ in general. Most of all, however, there aregoing to be amazing happenings in the human heart and mind. Expect theunexpected is the story of the years to come. Many of these events are going tobe very challenging and many will be wonderful. In the end it will all bewonderful. We are at the cusp of a transition from an epoch of control,limitation and oppression to one of vastly expanded awareness and potential thatwill manifest a world that we can currently only dream of. Dream the dream –it’s coming. The Control System of the ages will not go quietly, or immediately.Go, however, it will, for its very informational/vibrational foundations areeroding by the day. The vibrational sands are shifting; the vibration isquickening; and, to mix my metaphors, the house of cards is coming down once werealise that we are the ones holding it up.image [../Images/00028.jpg] Figure 20: A new energy is being ‘breathed’ into the world to break up thedensity, fear and ignorance on which the Control System depends Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) So, there you go. There is so much to tell about what is ‘going on’, but thethemes are essentially quite simple. I am going to tell the story in the pagesthat follow that I have been guided to uncover and communicate since 1990. It isa story that I clearly came here to tell on April 29th, 1952. I am not going togo into the endless detail. I have done that in other books, and Human Race GetOff Your Knees runs to 355,000 words, 650 pages and has hundreds ofillustrations. What I am setting out to do here is connect the essential dotsacross a great swathe of interconnected subjects which often do not appear to beconnected at first sight. It is an encapsulation of all that I have learnedsince I walked through the psychic’s door all those years ago.This is not the end of the story. There is always so much more to know. But atthis time of great change and upheaval, when people across the world are gettingmore and more uneasy about the events that they see, this book will provide anurgently-needed road map or SatNav for what is ‘going on’.What people make of it, of course, is entirely up to them, and so it should be."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00029.jpg] We cannot grasp what is happening in our lives or the world until we understandat least the themes and foundations of reality itself. What is ‘reality’? Whoare we? Where are we? Where do we ‘come’ from?How few people ask these big questions compared with those who ask what timedoes the game show or the football start. Shocking numbers of people are somesmerised by the five-sense movie that they live their lives like moths staringwide-eyed at a light on the porch, never seeing the guy with the swattercreeping up behind to smack ‘em on the bum. This has been the human plight forthousands of years, and then some. Ask most people to explain Life and the Worldand they will likely quote you from the religion they have been programmed tobelieve in, or from the official scientific ‘norm’. But religions are prisons ofthe mind – yes all of them, even the ‘enlightened’ ones like Buddhism. How doesa shaven head make you more ‘spiritual’? Or, as with Sikhs, not cutting yourhair at all? The ‘New Age’ is a religion in its own way, while at the same timeit dismisses religion. Why would a religion want to tell you the truth aboutreality when it only survives by you not knowing that truth? They are going tosell you a dogma that suits the men in frocks by maintaining you in a state ofignorance. Those who are awake enough to see who and what we really are wouldnever follow a religion. It is a case of cause and effect. ‘Hey, terrible news,bishop, rabbi, Imam, guru – the people are not stupid anymore and the tills havestopped ringing.’ Cause and effect. But surely mainstream science can tell usabout reality and how we are interacting with it. I mean, they’re scientists, sothey must be clever. Actually, that’s not a cause and effect. What we call‘science’ is a mass of different disciplines that rarely talk to each other andcompete for funding and prominence. They focus on the various ‘dots’, but neverconnect them. Scientists have the image of being very knowledgeable, but mostknow a lot about a little and unless you connect the ‘littles’ you’ll never seethe bigger picture. They also have a song sheet called the ‘scientificconsensus’ from which most dare not deviate for fear of losing funding, jobs andperceived ‘prestige’. Most ‘scientists’ are working to produce new technology,drugs, food additives and suchlike – not investigating the nature of reality.The overwhelming majority are followers and advocates of a religion called‘Scientism’ which, like all religions, is founded on fiercely imposed dogma thatmust be obeyed. Science is, like the New Age, a religion that dismissesreligion.One of the most vocal in this, and in the condemnation and ridicule ofalternative methods of healing and explaining the Universe, is a bloke inBritain called Richard Dawkins. Dogma Dawkins would be more appropriate. But,hey, he’s a professor at Oxford University. He must be clever and highlyintelligent, right? Well, I have seen him in action at close hand and, er, howcan I put it? Let’s just say that this wasn’t my experience. Dogma Dawkins, aman who looks very ill at ease in his own skin, lays into religion and yet he isan evangelist for his own – Scientism – which is as dogmatic and ignorant as allthe rest when it comes to explaining ‘Life’. Those of the Dogma Dawkins’mentality live in prisons of the mind, like all religious fanatics. Mainstream‘science’ is a joke. There are real scientists who seek truth and understandingand not fancy titles or grants with strings attached from corporations; but theywork outside of the mainstream which would otherwise suffocate their zest forgenuine inquiry. What we call ‘Science’ is deeply manipulated and controlled andit will never uncover and tell us the truth about reality when thosemanipulating and controlling, not least through funding, don’t want us to knowwho we are, where we are and where we come from. This ignorance is, after all,their prime means of human control. Those in the inner sanctums of the globalsecret-society network know about reality and how we interact with it. Theirpower would be gone if the target population also knew. The bottom line for theHidden Hand is to stop us from knowing who we are and where we are, and so itmust control science and suppress genuine scientific investigation. We now havethousands of mainstream television channels across the world; but how manyprogrammes do you ever see exploring reality outside the norms of religion and‘science’, or even exploring reality at all? Hardly any. But then the globalmedia is owned by the same cabal of families and secret societies that own orcontrol science, religion, politics, banking and the major corporations. Thelack of discussion about reality almost anywhere in the media tells yousomething very profound about how badly they want to keep us in ignorance ofthis most basic area of understanding from which everything else comes.So here is what they don’t want you to know …THE COSMIC INTERNETMost people think that we live in a ‘physical’ world, and I grant you thatcertainly appears to be the case. But it’s not, because we don’t. There is no‘physical’. It’s all an illusion. We are infinite, eternal Consciousness havingan experience in a tiny range of frequencies that we call the ‘physical world’,but that isn’t. We are not our name, body, occupation, family background, race,colour or income bracket. They are our current experience; they are not who weare. We are Consciousness – infinite, eternal Awareness. We have no form in ourcore state; we are just awareness, and an expression of Infinite Awareness.Hence, it is said that we are ‘all One’. Yes, one Infinite Awareness havingdifferent experiences from different points of observation – different levels ofawareness and perception. Our true nature was described very well by a CentralAmerican shaman (you know, those who the Dogma Dawkins’ of this world woulddismiss as primitive and ignorant): ‘We are perceivers, we are awareness; we arenot objects; we have no solidity … We are boundless … We, or rather our reason[programming] forget this, and thus entrap the totality of ourselves in avicious circle from which we rarely emerge in our lifetime.’ The aim of theControl System is to keep it that way for the entire journey from womb to tomb.Albert Einstein said that reality is an illusion, albeit a persistent one. It is‘persistent’ because we are living in a virtual-reality universe that we decodeinto (illusory) ‘physical’ form from an information construct that is the samein theme as the wireless Internet. The information is encoded in waveform orenergetic vibration/resonance, and the mind–body is an incredibly advancedbiological computer system which decodes that information and allows ourInfinite Awareness to interact with this range of frequencies that we call the‘world’ (Fig 21). The mind–body computer is the vehicle for the real us –Consciousness – to interact with this range of frequencies. I could not tap thiskeyboard and you could not hold this book, or anything else, unless we had anouter ‘shell’ resonating within the frequency range that we wish to experience.Consciousness, our core self, is vibrating way faster than anything withinvisible light. If we didn’t have the body then never the twain would meet, inthe same way that Radio 1 doesn’t interact with Radio 2. They are resonating todifferent frequencies. People who have had ‘near death experiences’, where theirbody has died and then been revived, describe the out-of-body state asdramatically different to the reality they perceived from ‘inside’ the body.They have fantastically expanded awareness and they are able to ‘see’ eventhough they have no eyes. They are experiencing the real self, undiminished bythe limitations of mind–body. I was sitting in the bath one day when a series ofclear pictures appeared in my ‘head’. The first was billowing energy, which Iimmediately took to represent Consciousness. Then an eye appeared in theConsciousness and in front of that came a telescope. The Earth and our realityappeared at the other end of the telescope and the final movement was for thetelescope to morph into a human body. I asked Neil Hague to paint arepresentation of what I saw (Fig 22). This is what mind–body is – a lens forConsciousness to experience this reality. But humanity has been systematicallymanipulated to self-identify with the lens and not the real self. We talk aboutpeople dying, but ‘they’ don’t die and cannot die. It is their body, their‘operating system’, that ‘dies’, not ‘them’ – Consciousness. ‘Dying’ is merelyour Consciousness putting down the telescope when it has ceased to function. Imake the clear and important distinction between what I call ‘Mind’ or‘mind–body’ and what I call ‘Consciousness’. You can symbolise the differencevery well if you think of Consciousness as the infinite free-flowing ocean, andmind– body as more like frozen water. It is far more dense and limited (Fig 23).Ramana Maharshi, who spent most of his life meditating on a mountain in India,described it very well when he said: ‘Mind is consciousness which has put onlimitations. You are originally unlimited and perfect. Later you take onlimitations and become the mind.’image [../Images/00030.jpg] Figure 21: The human body is the vehicle that allows the real us – Consciousness– to experience this range of frequencies. Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00031.jpg] Figure 22: The body is like a ‘lens’ that focuses our attention on a specificrange of frequency which then becomes our sense of who we are and where we are Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) Understanding this difference between mind–body and Consciousness is crucial tohaving any idea about what is happening in the world (Fig 24). We live in what Iterm the ‘Cosmic Internet’, which is, as I say, the same in theme as thewireless Internet. You can’t see the wireless Internet because the informationexists in the unseen beyond the frequency range of human sight. Most peoplewould be denying its existence if they didn’t know that it was there – ‘Don’t bestupid, I can’t see it, hear it, touch it, taste it or smell it, so it can’texist. I told you that Icke was crazy!’ But we know it exists from the fact thatwhen we go to a computer and ‘log on’ to the wireless Internet we see a wholeglobal collective reality appearing on the screen – the World Wide Web. It isthe same collective reality that can be accessed by people in the Americas,Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. In fact, by anyone who has a computer,except in places like China where the computer system is firewalled to denyaccess to much of the Web. They block information that the authorities don’twant the people to see with their ‘Great Firewall of China’. Something very muchlike that is happening to humanity in general through what I call the‘Saturn-Moon Matrix’, and other related manipulations – but that’s for later.The point is that the base construct of the Universe is waveform informationencoded as vibrational resonance. I will call this waveform informationconstruct the ‘Metaphysical Universe’ and it contains the information fieldsfrom which everything manifests. We decode this information through themind–body computer system into the illusory ‘solid’ world that we think we areexperiencing daily. It is no more ‘solid’ than the figures in a virtual-realitygame on your computer screen. They are only information in waveform on thesoftware disk being decoded into that apparently ‘solid’ state. The brain andthe genetic structure of the mind–body computer transform vibrationalinformation in the same way from the waveform ‘Metaphysical Universe’ intoelectrical and other information on the ‘screen’ in our ‘heads’. We thenexperience this as the ‘physical world’ (Figs 25 and 26). The brain is in totaldarkness, but we see light. How? By decoding waveform information. The inside ofa computer is dark, but we see lights and colours on the screen. The CosmicInternet is an interactive ‘game’. We receive information from the waveformMetaphysical Universe, but we also ‘post’ with our thoughts, emotions andperceptions. Information goes both ways. Reality can change us, and we canchange reality.image [../Images/00032.jpg] Figure 23: Everything is the same Infinite Awareness, but there are limitlessexpressions of this same ‘Oneness’.

We have the mind–body computerinterface that allows us to experience this reality, and we have Consciousnessfeeding us the bigger picture – an awareness of a greater reality. But when webecome disconnected from Consciousness we have only the limitations of mind–bodyto give us a fix on who we are and where we are. The Control System’s media and‘education’ then seek to programme the sense of reality of ‘isolated’ mind–bodyto produce ignorant, bewildered slaves and system-fodder Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00034.jpg] Figure 25: The foundation of the Universe is waveform information and the humanmind–body biological computer decodes this into electrical, digital andholographic information that we perceive as the ‘physical world’ Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) ‘SEEING’ IS DECODINGWe say that we are ‘going on the Internet’, but we don’t go on the Internet. Thecomputer does. We observe the Internet and interact with it through thecomputer. Mind–body is a ‘computer’ for our Consciousness and the means throughwhich we ‘go on’, or ‘log on’, to the waveform information construct – theCosmic Internet. The human five senses decode vibrational information intoelectrical information which is transmitted to the brain, and ultimately theentire genetic structure, to be decoded into the digital and holographicinformation that we experience as the ‘physical’ world. I’ll explain more aboutthe holographic and digital levels of reality in a moment. These various formsare all the same information being passed on in different forms. The vehiclesfor the information may look very different, as with a woman in a red dress whohands information to a man in a blue T-shirt who gives it to a bloke in a greysuit. But it is the same information, and so it is when the vibrational becomesthe electrical, digital and holographic. There is no ‘world’ outside of us; itonly appears to be like that because of the way we decode reality. ‘Physical’reality is within us and what we experience is what we have chosen, consciouslyor unconsciously, to decode from the Cosmic Internet. We can only ‘physically’see and experience the world that we think we live ‘in’ when we decode waveforminformation into the electrical, digital and holographic. Everything else in theUniverse remains in the unseen waveform unless we do that. A few moreopen-minded scientists have postulated over the years that the world that we seeand experience only exists in that form when it is observed. Change ‘observed’to decoded and that is correct. When you put an information disk into a computeryou don’t see all the information on the screen at the same time. You only seethat part of the disk that is being read – decoded – at any moment. The restremains in a waveform state. So it is with our reality. I’ll give you awonderful example of what I mean. American author, Michael Talbot, wrote anexcellent book called The Holographic Universe (HarperCollins; New Edition,1996) and he told the story of an experience he had when a stage hypnotist wasasked to attend a party to entertain the guests. A man called Tom was ‘putunder’ and the hypnotist told him that when he returned to an awakened state hewould not be able to see his daughter. The hypnotist then led the daughter tostand right in front her sitting father. He was looking straight into her belly.Tom was brought ‘back’ and the hypnotist asked him if he could see his daughter.‘No,’ he said, she wasn’t there. Actually, she was right in front of him. Thehypnotist went behind the daughter and put his hand in the small of her back. ‘Iam holding something, Tom,’ he said. ‘Can you see it?’ Tom immediately answered:‘Yes, it’s a watch,’ It was so clear to him, despite the little matter of hisdaughter standing between him and the watch. He was asked if he could read aninscription on the watch, which he did. Now, if you told that story to mostpeople, especially a Dogma Dawkins in the scientific arena, they would say thiswas impossible and could not have happened. But it is not impossible at all. Itis very simple and logical once you know how reality works. The base form ofeverything in this Universe, including the human body, is a waveform informationfield resonating beyond the digital/holographic realm that were can see, hear,touch, taste and smell. If any of those information fields are not decoded ontoour brain/genetic ‘screens’ into a digital/holographic state then we are notgoing to be able to see them. The hypnotic implant, in the case of Tom, blockedor firewalled his brain and stopped it decoding his daughter’s waveform field.He didn’t decode her into a digital/holographic state that his conscious mindcould see. He therefore saw what was behind her – the watch – because in hisdecoded ‘physical’ reality she wasn’t there (Fig 27). Everyone else in the roomcould see her. They had not been subject to the hypnotic firewall and theydecoded the daughter’s waveform through to the ‘physical’. A profound truth wasbeing spoken when the child in The Matrix said, ‘There is no spoon – it is notthe spoon that bends; it is only yourself.’ There is no ‘spoon’ or anything elsein a physical sense. How can there be when there is no physical? It is all aboutthe way we decode reality. We can see this when people walk barefoot across hotcoals and don’t get burned. They enter another state of awareness that decodesreality differently to the norm, which would otherwise decode:‘Aaaaaaaaaggggghhhhh!!!! Call an ambulance.’ An illusion can only burn anillusion if you believe it can and so decode that reality. There are nomiracles, only a greater understanding of how it all works. We only feel painwhen the brain decodes the communication from the source of the pain. If thatdoesn’t happen – no pain. We can now see that this scene from the first Matrixmovie was perfectly accurate:image [../Images/00035.jpg] Figure 26: The ‘world’ appears to be ‘outside’ of us when it is all decodedwaveform information in our head, heart and genetic structure Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00036.jpg] image [../Images/00037.jpg] Figure 27: Waveform is the prime reality in the Universe, and what we do notdecode through into the holographic, or ‘physical’, does not exist in ourexperienced perception. Therefore, ‘Tom’s’ daughter could be seen by everyone inthe room – except him Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) > Neo: ‘This isn’t real?’> Morpheus: ‘What is real? How do you define ‘real’? If you’re talking about> what you can feel, what you can smell, taste and see, then ‘real’ is simply> electrical signals interpreted by your brain.’ So it is, and this has profound consequences for the way humanity is controlled.The simplest way to censor the Cosmic Internet is to target the body–computer tolimit the range of information – insight, understanding – that it can decode.This is done by programming perception in the same way that a stage hypnotist isprogramming the perception of the stooges on the stage. The idea is to ensurethat we decode reality (like ‘Tom’) in line with the hypnotic implants (beliefs)that the hypnotist downloads into our minds. I went to a number of thesehypnotist stage shows for my research and I watched people see, hear, touch,taste and smell things that were not there, except in their programmedperception of reality. I saw others that didn’t see things that were there. Isaw people eating a potato while believing it was an apple. The potato tastedlike an apple to them after the hypnotist had implanted the belief that this iswhat it was. When the tongue communicated electrical information from the potatoto the brain, this was decoded as apple. The decoding system had been ‘hacked’by the hypnotist. Think about the potential for individual and mass programmingin the light of this when a handful of interbreeding families have control ofthe major sources of information that people are seeing and hearing throughouttheir lives. Humanity as a whole is being programmed to decode reality in thedesired way – desired by the controllers – by having beliefs and perceptionsimplanted through ‘education’ (yeah, right), the media, religion, doctors,scientists, politicians, and so on. The overwhelming majority are not even doingit knowingly. They are themselves programmed to program others. Scientists canaffect the outcomes of their own experiments for the same reason – throughbelief or disbelief (another form of belief!). Our mind–body decoding system isalso being systematically imbalanced and destabilised through chemical additivesin food and drink, fluoride and other shite in the water supplies, andever-gathering forms of electrical, electromagnetic and radiation pollution.EVERYTHING HAS AWARENESSMind–body is an electrochemical organism on one level and so, of course, it canbe distorted electrochemically – and it is. The ‘physical’ level of the body issome 60 to 70 per cent water, and this is highly significant when you think thatwater has been shown to have a memory that retains information. The AerospaceInstitute in Stuttgart, Germany, developed a means of making the structure ofwater visible. This allowed them to see that every drop of water has it ownunique structure. I have been using the analogy for a long time of how we arelike droplets of water in the ocean. We are unique in ourselves, but all part ofthe same whole. The findings of this German Institute confirm that the analogyis extremely appropriate. Researchers ran an experiment in which people wereasked to put droplets from the same bowl of water into separate containers. Youwould think that all the droplets must have looked the same. But, no. The dropsdelivered by each person were unique to that person. Drops that involved personnumber one all looked the same; drops involving person number two all looked thesame, but different from person one, and so on (Fig 28). The water had retainedthe memory, or information, relating to each individual. Researchers have putdifferent flowers in the water and then found the image of the same flower inevery droplet of that water. Of course water has a memory. Everything is theinteraction of awareness and information, and everything has a form of memory –which is what? The ability to store and retain information. Scientists can’tfind the source of the human memory because they are looking in the wrong place.It is not in the brain; it is in the entire genetic structure which is only aprojection of waveform information, anyway. The foundation of memory isinformation retained at the waveform level of reality. The healing technique ofHomeopathy is based on this fact. Mainstream science arrogantly dismissesHomeopathy by saying that the ingredients in its potions are so diluted thatnothing is left except water. Yes, water carrying the information of theingredients in its memory. One of the Aerospace Institute researchers said thattheir findings reveal that rivers and seas are constantly absorbing information.He said that if you drink water at the mouth of the River Rhine, you will bedrinking more information than if you drank it at the source. But what kind ofinformation would that be, given that rivers are now so polluted? What ispollution and radiation? Rogue information, like a computer virus. This is theprime reason why the bloodline Control System is pouring pollution and radiationinto the seas and rivers. Look at Fukushima and the oil disaster in the Gulf ofMexico alone. They are purposely distorting the information harmony of theplanet for reasons I will be explaining. The bloodline families are desperate tosuppress this knowledge that everything is connected and everything hasawareness. The late Jacques Benveniste, a French immunologist, was savaged bythe ignorant prostitutes of the ‘scientific’ mainstream when he realised in the1980s that water had a memory. Nature, the prestigious, but ludicrous‘scientific journal’ in Britain, led the character assassination of Benveniste.The attack was joined by James Randi, the ‘magician’ and professional ‘debunker’of anything that threatens the scientific song sheet. The editor of Nature atthe time, John Maddox, who called for at least one book challenging mainstreamdogma to be ‘burned’, said that Benveniste’s findings appeared to have no‘physical basis’. There we go – the five sense ‘scientific’ jailbird again.There is no ‘physical’, mate. Get used to it! Nature ran an editorial sayingthat if Benveniste was right ‘much of modern science would have to be junked’.Oh my God! Call security, call the police, call the fire service, call anyone.Aaaaaaaaaggggghhhhh!!!! The deeply unpleasant John Maddox died in 2009. I bet hefeels a right prat now.image [../Images/00038.jpg] Figure 28: Each line of water droplets relates to a different person who tookthe droplets from the same container of water. Their unique information wasretained by the water, because it is a form of consciousness and so has a‘memory’ HOLOGRAMS WITHIN HOLOGRAMS‘Physical’ reality is an illusion that only exists on a symbolic ‘screen’ in ourbrain and genetic structure. The world looks and feels solid, that’s for sure,and if you bang your head against a wall, it hurts. But if you walk through firein a ‘normal’ state of mind you’ll get burned, while others, in an alteredstate, will not. What we experience as ‘solid’ is only resistance between twodifferent electromagnetic (waveform information) states. The world cannot besolid. Scientists tell us ‘matter’ is made up of atoms, but atoms have nosolidity. They are just packets of energy with electrons orbiting a nucleus, andthe electrons and nucleus aren’t solid either – nothing is. There is no‘matter’. The proportions in Figure 29 are not the true distances inside anatom. The true scale would be far too big to put in a book. One writer used atelling analogy: ‘If an atom was the size of a cathedral, the nucleus would bethe size of a ten cent piece.’ How can ‘empty’ atoms make a solid ‘physical’world? They can’t, and they don’t need to. The world is not ‘solid’. It isholographic – illusory ‘solid’. What scientists identify as atoms are part ofthe energetic process that takes place as waveform information is decodedthrough the electrical to the digital and holographic. Holograms that you canbuy in shops are made by diverting two parts of a laser onto a photographicprint. One part, the ‘reference beam’, goes pretty much directly onto the printwhile the other, the ‘working beam’, encodes the waveform image of the objectbeing photographed. It then collides on the print with the reference beam (Fig30 [../Text/index_split_010.html#filepos138840]). This creates what they call inholographics an ‘interference pattern’. What is that? Information in waveform(Fig 31 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos139460]). It is like dropping twostones into a pond and watching the waves expand and collide to create a wavepattern information construct of where the stones dropped, how fast, and so on.The holographic interference pattern is a waveform information construct of theobject being photographed, and when you direct a laser at that pattern anamazing thing happens. An apparently three-dimensional projection of the objectappears before you, and the best of them can look as solid as you and I (Figs 32[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos139954] to 35[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos140341]). Holograms are being used more andmore in exhibitions and suchlike, and they are now developing digital hologramsthat are even closer to the reality we experience daily. A mainstream newsreport said: ‘And they look real – so real that when Ford used a [digital]hologram to show off a car concept model people stopped, afraid to walk into it.They thought the holographic car was really there …’ The motorcycle in Figure 32[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos139954] is a digital hologram and not atall ‘solid’. The man on the right in Figure 36[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos141345] is in Melbourne, Australia, but hehas been projected as a hologram onto a stage in Adelaide. I have been writingand talking about how the ‘physical’ world is holographic for a long time nowand so I was very interested to see a copy of the mainstream science magazine,New Scientist, as I was walking through Heathrow Airport in 2009. The frontcover said: ‘You are a hologram … projected from the edge of the universe’ (Fig37 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos141705]). It was an article featuring ascientist who was investigating the possibility that the Universe is a hologram.It didn’t tell us very much, really, but at least some scientists are beginningto see that this is the direction in which they need to go. The holograms arenot projected from the edge of the Universe; they are decoded from informationin the waveform construct that I am calling the Metaphysical Universe.Scientists have been baffled at experiments that show that what they call aparticle can be a waveform at the same time. But let’s think about this from theholographic point of view. The interference pattern, or waveform print, is theinformation from which the hologram is ‘read’. Without the waveform informationthere is no ‘3D’ hologram, which is only a projection from the waveforminformation field. So not only can the waveform and the hologram exist at thesame time – they have to. One is only an expression of the other. Take away thewaveform information and you take away the hologram. Oh yes, one other thing.What happens when the information on the waveform print is not being decoded,‘observed’, by the laser? It remains only in waveform, exactly as our ‘physical’reality only exists when we decode it.image [../Images/00039.jpg] Figure 29: Empty atoms. How can they be the structure of a ‘solid’ world?

If you cut a holographic print into four piecesand fire the laser at them you would not get a quarter of the picture. You wouldget a quarter-sized version of the whole picture (Fig 38). This explains many‘mysteries’, including how healing methods dismissed as mumbo jumbo by the DogmaDawkins brigade have a very logical basis. Reflexology, acupuncture and otheralternative practices say that they can treat the whole body working withspecific points in the ear, foot etc. There are points in every part of the bodythat relate to the organs, and to the body in general (Fig 39). But, of coursethat must be the case. The body is a hologram and so every part must be asmaller version of the whole. All the parts are interconnected. You treat theheart itself when you treat an area of the foot holographically relating to theheart. The holographic nature of ‘physical’ reality explains why the human auricfield and the Earth’s magnetic field look the same, and why brain activitymirrors activity in the Universe (Figs 40 and 41). This is also the basis ofpractices such as palmistry. The hand contains information about the whole body.The term ‘as above, so below’ is describing the holographic universe, althoughmost people who use the phrase don’t realise that. Harvey Bigelsen M.D., afriend of mine in California, has even written a book about the way blood isholographic – see Holographic Blood at: www.drbigelsen.com[http://www.drbigelsen.com]. This means that, even at the body–hologram level,we are the Earth and the Universe (what I call the ‘Super Hologram’). Everyexpression of form is a smaller version of the whole. It is not only at theholographic level that we are all ‘one’. It is the same with the digital,electrical and waveform levels, too. It has to be – the holographic is only aprojection of the waveform and everything in ‘between’. My goodness, we arealready a long way from ‘Little Me’, I am just my name, job, and all that stuff.No, we are everything. We have just forgotten. Physicist Alain Aspect at theUniversity of Paris discovered in 1982 that subatomic particles caninstantaneously communicate with each other no matter if they are an inch or 100billion miles apart. The discovery demolished Albert Einstein’s contention thatnothing can surpass the speed of light (nonsense) and perplexed mainstreamscience. But this ‘mystery’ is easily explained when you realise that everythingis One and that we live in a holographic reality. The ‘particles’ are only aholographic expression of a seamless waveform information field – theMetaphysical Universe. At that level, the particles can communicate instantlybecause they are each other.image [../Images/00053.jpg] image [../Images/00054.jpg]Figure 40: The human energy field and the Earth’s energy field. As above, sobelow image [../Images/00055.jpg] Figure 41: Human brain cell activity and electrical activity in the Cosmos. Asabove, so below image [../Images/00056.jpg] Figure 42: The Fibonacci sequence of numbers can be found in the way plantsgrow, shells form and in the proportions of the human face image [../Images/00057.jpg]Figure 43: The digital level of experienced reality explains why number sequences andmathematical proportions keep repeating, such as the Golden Section (Pi, Phi),and the Fibonacci sequence in which the last two numbers are added together toget the next one, as in 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 … The sequence can be foundthroughout nature in everything from the way plants and shells grow to theproportions of the human body (Figs 42 and 43). This must be so when what wecall Nature is a vast tapestry of digital holographic forms. Numerology is thereading of the digital level of reality, and so is the Chinese ‘I Ching’ andother methods and techniques. The numbers running down the computer screens inThe Matrix, and the way that Neo saw everything as digital when his mind openedto Consciousness, were based on fact. Numbers are digital expressions ofwaveform information. When the same numbers continually recur, they are signs ofsomething recurring in the waveform information fields. Ancient initiates andsecret societies who had this understanding built their temples and otherbuildings to certain geometrical and mathematical proportions. They knew thatthis would automatically connect the building to the vibrational fields that thenumbers digitally represented. The Illuminati bloodline families and theirsecret-society network plan dates for their events and manipulations in greatdetail so that they happen at a time and place that gives them the best chanceof success from their point of view. Those in power who publically dismiss andridicule practices such as numerology and astrology are using them in verydetailed ways behind the scenes. Was the date of 9/11, the emergency telephonenumber in the United States, only a coincidence? Is even having 911 as theemergency number a coincidence? You must be joking.DISCONNECTING MIND FROM CONSCIOUSNESSVital for the Control System (the very few) to make slaves of the people (theenormous many) is to ensure that the people perceive and decode reality onlythrough the lens of mind–body, and maintain a lifetime disconnection from theinfluence of their true and eternal self – Consciousness. You have everythingyou need when you retain a connection between mind–body (the computer) andConsciousness (the one at the desk with the mouse and keyboard) – see Figure 44.Mind–body ‘logs’ you on to the Cosmic Internet and this allows you to interactwith its frequency range; but Consciousness gives you the bigger picture and thewider perspective that the five senses cannot perceive. You are, in short, ‘in’this world, in the sense that you are experiencing it, but not ‘of’ this worldin terms of your entire perspective of reality. Take Consciousness away and youare left with mind–body and the realm of the five senses. This is like acomputer now deciding where you go on the Internet and what you think about it.Mind–body can do this because it has awareness. Everything does. Mind– body is abiological computer, as they are called, which not only reacts to data asprogrammed to do so, but can also assess that data and make decisions about whatto do with it. The immune system is doing this all the time. But mind–body issupposed to be a vehicle for Consciousness to experience this reality – not tobe the governor of the reality that it decodes. This, however, is where thegreat majority of humanity is still at, although it is changing, thank goodness.Humans are imprisoned in the mind–body computer. And what are computers designedto do? Be programmed. Here you have the reason why people are so predictable intheir responses and behaviour patterns. They are running the same softwarecalled programmed beliefs and perceptions which, like the potato and the appleand the guy who couldn’t see his daughter, decode reality to fit the beliefs andperceptions. It’s a feedback loop. You become a computer terminal on aninformation grid once Consciousness is out of the picture. People are told whatto believe, and the belief programs the decoding process to manifest what theythink they see and hear. Most of this programming is done via the oblonghypnotist in almost every home called the television. This presents to yousomething that sums it up perfectly – programmes.image [../Images/00058.jpg] Figure 44: Consciousness is symbolically sitting with the keyboard and the mouseobserving the Cosmic Internet through the computer interface of body–mind. Theproblem starts when body–mind no longer responds to the tapping keys andclicking mouse and decides where to go and what to do from an extremely limitedsense of perception Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) The foundation of the global conspiracy of the ages is to disconnect mind–bodyfrom Consciousness and then program mind–body with the sense of reality thatsuits the Control System. This is the perception of limitation, Little Me, and,I can’t. This is further underpinned by fear, worry, anxiety and an overallsense of powerlessness. Religion, mainstream media, song-sheet science, medicineand ‘education’ were all invented and imposed as vehicles for mass perceptionprogramming. They are there to program mind–body with a reality of Little Me andsubordination to belief systems (hypnotic implants and firewalls) designed toimprison people in a pea-sized perception of self and events. The world is‘mad’, because it is asleep. It is no good getting angry and frustrated at thosewho can’t see the bloody obvious (obvious to Consciousness). They are simply notconscious enough to compute and decode the bloody obvious. But they can make thechoice to do so whenever they decide to open their minds. The controllers areeven more insane, but not quite as asleep in the same way. They have worked foraeons to manipulate humanity into a smaller box than they are in. As the sayinggoes: ‘In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.’ The controllers arethe ‘one-eyed man’ and so no match for two-eyed, third-eyed Consciousness oncewe awaken to it. The entire structure of mainstream human society is designed tohold people in a hypnotic, amnesic state, believing that their body, name, job,etc., is what they are. Only then can the very few control everyone else in theway that they currently do (but won’t for too much longer). All this explainswhy humans can be so stupid and the world so insane."},{"pageContent":" Consciousness doesn’t fight, for example. It knows that we are all the sameInfinite Awareness – Mind–body fights because it sees only apartness andseparation in the ‘physical’ world of daily experience. It is through theseillusory fault-lines of perceived separation that we have individual conflict,wars and the belief that we need to constantly compete with other expressions ofseparation. But there is no separation, except in our own distorted perception.Albert Einstein rightly said: ‘A human being is a part of the whole called by us“Universe”, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, histhoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of opticaldelusion of his consciousness.’ This optical delusion is the mind–body. Wheneveryou see troops in uniform with guns in their hands, or dropping bombs from theirflying virtual-reality machines, you are looking at the unconscious playing outthe programmed and computerised illusions and delusions of mind–body. Theseminds in uniform are sent to war by minds in dark suits. The weapons they useare made by minds in white coats and overalls in the centres of ‘science’ andtechnology. They are sold to minds in government by minds in armament companiesand paid for by the minds in government borrowing nonexistent money called‘credit’ from minds that run the banks; and all of this is reported inaccuratelyby minds in the media. There is no Consciousness to be seen in this panorama ofmind that runs the world. How can ‘journalists’ imprisoned in mind accuratelyreport events that need Consciousness to see them in their true light? Theconspiracy is a mind game in every sense. The isolated mind, seen in Figure 45,is the whole source of the problem. It is the village idiot compared withConsciousness. This is why the world is as it is. To open your mind toConsciousness means to let go of the programs of mind, fears of mind, includingthe fear of what other people think. It means doing what you know(Consciousness) to be right, rather than what you think (Mind) is right for youin the moment. It means losing the fear of doing what you know to be right. AsMorpheus said in The Matrix: ‘You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt anddisbelief. Free your mind.’ Even better – free yourself from mind. LetConsciousness in with all the challenges in being accepted and understood in aworld of mind. Opening minds to Consciousness will not only support therevolution of human society. It is the revolution of human society.image [../Images/00059.jpg] Figure 45: The isolated mind that controls mainstream science, media, politics,‘education’, religion etc., etc STILL, SILENT, SENSATIONALThere is much to open up to … an infinity of all possibility. This is who we are– All Possibility having an experience of some possibilities. In 2003, thesynchronicity of my life took me to the Brazilian rainforest not far from thenorthern city of Manaus. I went to a centre in the forest to speak to agathering of people over several days, and to take a rainforest brew calledAyahuasca, which can expand your awareness and enable you to access higherlevels of consciousness. You drink it in a small glass and it tastes a bit likeliquorice. Some people have a bad time on it. I had a life-changing experienceover two nights. I could have taken it four times, but I only did it twice. Igot what I needed and I have never felt the need to do it again. I found myselfsaying the words: ‘I am love’; and then, ‘I am everything and everything is me;I am infinite possibility,’ as I entered an altered state on the first evening.When I did so, an extraordinary energy began to pour from the centre of my chestand fill the room. I was lying on a mattress in the pitch dark, but first oneand then three striplights on the ceiling came on without anyone touching theswitch. The switch would have turned them all on, anyway. The music player beganto turn on and off, triggered by the electromagnetic energy surging out of me.It is electromagnetic energy projected from another reality which is the sourceof many ‘ghostly’ and ‘paranormal’ happenings that often include electricalequipment turning on and off. The centre of the chest is the location of the‘heart chakra’, the balance centre of the seven major vortex points, or‘chakras’, which I described earlier. This is the real origin of the associationbetween the heart and ‘love’. The symbol of the ‘physical’ heart is used today,but it is the energetic heart that expresses love and much else. The ‘physical’heart is highly significant, too, and not only for pumping blood around thebody. The energetic heart is the source of our intuitive knowing, which is a farmore advanced state of awareness than thinking, and the heart is far moreintelligent and ‘enlightened’ than the brain when it is given a chance to impactupon our perception. Researchers at the Institute of HeartMath in the UnitedStates have established that the heart has its own energy field which encirclesthe body (Fig 46). The heart generates 60 times and more electrical amplitudethan the brain and it was going some this night in Brazil. I felt the energypouring from my heart chakra in an arc to the ‘third eye’, a source of psychicconnection on my forehead. The heart is a gland as well as an organ and secreteshormones that connect with the pineal and pituitary glands in the brain whichare part of the third eye. The sensation was like someone was tightly grippingmy forehead. I then began to speak about how humanity had become disconnectedfrom Infinite Oneness and how this was the reason for the world that we see.image [../Images/00060.jpg] Figure 46: An open heart has fantastic electromagnetic power – much greater thanthe brain On the second night, as I moved through altered states of awareness, a loud andlovely female voice spoke to me. ‘David,’ the voice began, ‘we are going to takeyou to where you come from, so that you can remember who you are.’ Where I‘went’ was a state of incredible bliss where everything was One. ‘This is theInfinite, David’ the voice said. ‘This is where you come from and this is whereyou shall return.’ There was no ‘time’; no ‘place’; no divisions; no us andthem. I was at One with all existence and no existence; but I still retained mysense of individuality. We transfer our point of attention to differentrealities. The mind–body focuses our attention on this tiny frequency range thatwe are experiencing called ‘visible light’, and so we perceive only this. It isonly a point of focus – attention – and infinity awaits us beyond the illusory‘walls’ of that perception. The voice said that all I really needed to know isthat ‘Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion.’ The wordswere repeated over and over. ‘Infinite Love is the only truth – everything elseis illusion.’ Put another way, Infinite Consciousness is the only truth –everything else is the imagination of that Consciousness made manifest ininfinite forms. I call the ‘place’ that I experienced All Possibility. This isthe still and silent everything and I can tell you that it is LOVE. I don\"t meanthe ‘physical’ and chemical attraction that I dub ‘mind love’. I have met manypeople subjected to horrific government mind-control projects who wereprogrammed to fall in (mind) love with someone who was programmed to (mind) lovethem. All you have to do is stimulate certain chemicals in the brain and you canget people to ‘love’ someone they wouldn’t look twice at without the engineeredattraction. Most people in this reality who say they are in love are in mindlove. When the chemical attraction subsides they either break up or move intoreal love. We have to call this ‘unconditional love’, or, as I do, ‘heart love’,to make clear the difference. With heart love there can be no, ‘I don’t love youanymore because …’ Heart love says I just love you. It doesn’t say that I am‘in’ love with you. This implies the possibility of one day being ‘out’ of love.Heart love is simply, I love you. That’s it. No escape clauses necessary. Thisis the love that I felt in that still and silent heart of the All That Is – AllPossibility, or what some call ‘The Void’ (Fig 47). It may sound strange to saythat something that I experienced as still and silent can be All That Is, andAll Possibility. I understand that. It appears to mind that still and silent =nothing. Surely, only with movement, form or sound do we have a ‘something’,never mind an ‘everything’. The opposite is the case as usual in our suppressedand bewildered world. Stillness and silence is All Possibility waiting tomanifest. It is, therefore, everything and nothing; it is and it isn’t; it iseverywhere and nowhere. You can’t have everything and nothing? It must be or notbe? You can’t be everywhere and nowhere? Oh, yes you can. Everything must bepossible with All Possibility; and nothing. When you experience silence andstillness you are experiencing the All That Is waiting to manifest. When peoplemeditate deeply they go into a state of stillness and silence. This is the coreof our being – all being, and not being. Sit quietly for a moment and feel thesilence. Do it for long enough and you’ll hear the silence even in a noisylocation. You move your point of attention away from the realm of the fivesenses and into the All That Is. If you sit quietly for a moment and then starttalking, the words are one possibility manifesting out of All Possibility. Whenyou stop talking, that possibility returns to the silence of All Possibility.This is what happens when a ‘physical’ form ‘dies’ and returns to pure energy.The ‘worlds’ of illusory form and vibration emerge from the still and silent AllThat Is. This is what we call ‘Creation’. These ‘worlds’, or realities, are mademanifest by what you might describe as sound vibration, although it is more thanthat. The vibration, or waveform, is encoded with information generated byvarious expressions of ‘thought’, but again this is not the same as thought aswe perceive it. I prefer to use the word ‘imagination’. It is the creativeimagination of the All That Is which brings these worlds of vibration intobeing, and then other manifestations of the All That Is experience them and playwith them (Fig 48). These are the virtual-reality worlds which resonate todifferent frequencies and they can exist in the same ‘space’ as each other, asdo radio stations.image [../Images/00061.jpg] Figure 47: The still and silent All That Is; All Possibility; All Knowing image [../Images/00062.jpg] Figure 48: ‘Worlds’ of form (ranges of frequency) are created out of AllPossibility using information encoded in waveform (thought, sound) Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) Also, just to mark the card of the Dogma Dawkins mentality, the infinite ‘body’forms which emerge from All Possibility do not all look like humans do.Staggering, isn’t it? If anyone doubts that vibration can create form then go toYouTube and enter the word ‘Cymatics’. You will see random particles on a plate(All Possibility waiting to manifest), and when sound is played the particlesassemble to create incredible geometrical and other patterns. As the soundchanges, so the pattern changes. What I have described here explains why thevoice in Brazil told me: ‘If it vibrates, it is illusion.’Yes, the illusion of ‘physical’ Creation."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00063.jpg] Virtual-reality games are getting ever more sophisticated and ‘real’, and theday is coming when you will not be able to tell them apart from the virtualreality that we call the Universe. Technology is mirroring our experiencedreality and also giving us the tools and analogies to explain it.The most sophisticated of these games, when you wear special gloves and goggles,can already make false realities look and feel ‘real’. And what is thistechnology doing? It is hacking in to the five senses and manipulating them todecode a different reality to the one they normally would. This can be soeffective that some hospitals connect burns patients to virtual-realitytechnology while nurses are changing their dressings. It reduces the pain bytricking the brain into constructing another reality. People learn to flyaircraft to a large extent and do many other things by working with this sametechnology. Virtual-reality games communicate electrical information to gogglesand gloves, and the brain decodes this into pictures and sensations. The fivesenses communicate information to the brain in the same way for brain and bodyto construct ‘physical’ reality. They decode vibrational information intoelectrical information. The most obvious example is the ears, which pick upsound vibration and send it in electrical form to the brain which then ‘hears’;but all five senses are doing the same. A mainstream news report said: > Researchers have been able to translate brain signals into speech using> sensors attached to the surface of the brain for the first time. The> breakthrough, which is up to 90 per cent accurate, offers a way to communicate> for paralysed patients who cannot speak and could eventually lead to being> able to read anyone’s thoughts. There you go. The technology now exists to decode electrical signals in thebrain into speech, and this is what the brain does naturally. What we call‘speech’ is vibrational information generated by the vocal chords that our earstranslate into electrical information for the brain to turn into the ‘speech’that we recognise as language. There is no language until the brain hasconstructed it, and so, as I said earlier, an Italian psychic will ‘hear’(decode) waveform information in Italian and an English one in English. Even‘physical movement’ is a decoded illusion. There are brain malfunctions, forexample, that cause some people to see tea pouring into a cup as a still ‘freezeframe’; or, one moment they see a car in the distance and the next it is flyingpast them with nothing in between. I cannot stress enough that the ‘physical’world is an illusion and those behind the human Control System know this. Theyjust don’t want us to know, when the manipulation potential of us not knowing islimitless. The Universe is information, and information decoding information.You put information into a computer in the form of a disk or data stick, andother information – the computer – decodes that information. It is all encodingand decoding, encoding and decoding. Speaking and hearing is a simple example.PROGRAMMING PERCEPTIONWe don’t see, hear, feel, taste or smell until the brain decodes thatinformation and constructs that reality. This is how a hypnotist can makesomebody eating a potato taste an apple, and why the brain is the ‘stadium’ inwhich human life and the whole conspiracy to enslave humanity is played out (Fig49). Not only the brain, however, also the heart and the DNA/genetic structurein general. The Control System is constantly seeking to program the mind–bodythrough what we see and hear, to decode reality in ways that suit its agenda(Fig 50). The brain is very easy to trick. We can see this with opticalillusions and with hypnotism; and the brain wave state when we are watchingtelevision is the same as that which hypnotists use to implant perceptionprograms. Is this yet another coincidence? Not a chance. Television iscommunicating far more than the pictures we see and the words that we hear.People are told what to watch, eat, wear, think and ‘be’. They are told what tobelieve is success (money and fame) and failure (not having money and fame). Themost powerful forms of suggestion are subliminal or ‘below threshold’ and theybypass the conscious mind. Later they seep into the conscious mind from thesubconscious as apparently the person’s own thoughts, desires and ideas. Iwonder how many people actually have any original thoughts and perceptions thathave not been implanted through the endless sources available to the system.Many of these sources will not even be known outside of the secret researchprojects and the inner circle elite. Advertising, with all its subliminaltechniques, is an obvious example of manipulating perception, but my goodness sois television, radio and print ‘news’. It spews out the official (lying) versionof everything and it is especially effective in programming perception with oneof the major forms of mind control – repetition. The official story is given bythose in power to the mainstream media which then repeats it for all time as thetrue story of events. The official story becomes official history in this way –not through fact, but through repetition. Tell most people enough times and theywill believe that 19 Muslim terrorists were responsible for 9/11 on the ordersof Osama bin Laden from a cave in Afghanistan, and that an already dead Osamabin Laden has been killed again. Their perception of reality will have beenre-programmed even though both stories are blatant nonsense. It becomes an‘everybody knows that’. Everybody who has been programmed to believe that, wouldbe far more accurate. No-one’s perception is programmed more powerfully thanmost ‘journalists’.

However, the basicprinciples are the same. A serious virus in your desktop computer can damage theoperating system to the point where it will not even switch on. What do we say?‘My computer is dead.’ In other words, it is no longer able to function andprocess electrical power and information. The computer might be dead, but thechap with the keyboard and the mouse is still very much alive. He must now go insearch of another computer (reincarnation) if he wants to continue to experiencethe Internet. The same thing happens when our bodies die. Drop a computer from agreat height and it won’t work anymore. Fall off a cliff and … exactly.Computers go into sleep mode when they tick over on minimum energy. So does thehuman body. Computers have anti-virus technology to protect the operating systemfrom viruses, and the human body–computer has a fantastic expression of thatcalled the immune system. A desktop computer can be devastated by a new virusthat the software is not programmed to deal with. The worst of them can ‘kill’the computer. We see this with the immune system. Native Americans died in largenumbers when Europeans took smallpox to smallpox-free America. Their immunesystems did not have the ‘software’ to meet a challenge it had not experiencedbefore. Computer viruses are rogue information which distorts the informationharmony and balance of the operating system and creates chaos (Fig 51). The sameis true of the human body. I am going to emphasise quite a lot that thefoundation construct of the Universe is waveform information and the electrical,digital and holographic levels are only projections of that. It is so importantto hold that thought throughout to appreciate how it all works. We seedisharmony in our ‘physical’ (holographic) reality that we call illness ordis-ease. But this is only a reflection – a projection – of vibrational/waveformdisharmony. An illness, a poison, or whatever, is a decoded distortion at thewaveform information level which undermines the operating system – thebody–computer – in much the same way, in principle, as a virus undermines theone on your desk. We see a drug, for example, but that is a decoded informationfield that can either harmonise or – most likely with pharmaceutical drugs –imbalance the information field that is the body. We refer to this drug-inducedvibrational mayhem as ‘side effects’ when they are simply ‘effects’. There isnothing ‘side’ about them. They are as much an effect of the drug as the onethey say will be good for you in all the drug advertisements that pay forAmerican television. Appropriate, really, given that the pharmaceutical cartel,or Big Pharma, is owned by the same families and secret societies that own theAmerican TV networks. The cabal-owned Big Biotech and Big ‘Food’ corporationsare feeding rogue information to the body–computer operating system in the formof genetically-modified ‘food’ and chemical additives to limit and distort theway we decode reality.image [../Images/00066.jpg] Figure 51: A computer virus is rogue information and so are the attacks on thehuman mind–body computer Computers have a motherboard, and so does the body. This is the network ofenergy lines known as ‘meridians’ which are the basis of the ancient healing artof acupuncture. The picture on the left in Figure 52 is an enhanced image takenduring a French hospital study in which a tracer dye was injected into specificpoints on the meridians known as, not surprisingly, acupuncture points. You cansee in the picture where the dye travelled. The word that came to me immediatelywhen I saw it was ‘motherboard’. They have found that when what acupuncturecalls ‘chi’ energy is passing along the meridians too slowly or too quickly, orif there is a blockage anywhere, this manifests as some form of ‘physical’,mental or emotional problem. The reason for this is simple. The chi energy isactually information and the meridian network is a major part of the process,along with the brain and the heart, of interacting with the Cosmic Internet. Thebody cannot accurately decode and encode this information when the chi isblocked, or is circulating too slowly or too quickly, and the operating systemstarts to malfunction. The insertion of hair-like needles, and other acupuncturetechniques, seeks to balance the flow and remove any blockages to allow optimumcommunication to be restored. We can see the same principle in desktopcomputers. The first thing we usually notice when a computer is infected by avirus is that ‘my computer is running so slow today’. It is slow because thevirus is affecting the speed at which the information is being communicated.People laugh and scoff at the suggestion that acupuncture can cure a headachewith a needle in the foot, because they are, well, ignorant. Meridian lines ofenergy flow all around the body and if one connected to the head is blockedwhere it passes through the foot it would not do the headache much good to sticka needle in the head, would it? My great friend, Mike Lambert, from the ShenClinic on the Isle of Wight, says: ‘The location of the symptom is rarely thelocation of the cause.’ The human brain is what computer people call the CentralProcessing Unit, or CPU. It is, like the CPU, a main, but far from the only,processor of information traffic. The brain receives information from the restof the body system and the Cosmic Internet, and transmits its decoded response.‘Physical’, mental or emotional imbalances once again ensue when thiscommunication breaks down. Parts of the brain work on the binary system ofon–off electrical charges represented by 0 and 1, the way computers do. Thebrain also employs the trinary system that some research projects around theworld are introducing to computers. The added mode is coded as minus 1, andwould allow computers to ignore information when necessary just as the brain canignore your surroundings while you are concentrating on something. Another vitalaspect of reality decoding is that of the heart, and I will be coming to that.image [../Images/00067.jpg] image [../Images/00068.jpg]Figure 52: The meridian system of chi energy is the body–computer ‘motherboard’ HAVING A CHAT WITH MY DNADNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hard drive of the body–computer, and somuch more. It consists of codes known as A, G, C and T (Adenine, Guanine,Cytosine, Thymine). How the codes are arranged in relation to each other decidesif something manifests as a human, mouse or virus, for instance. The differencesin code arrangement can by very small compared with the differences in form (Fig53). Rats have something like 90 per cent of the DNA found in humans. DNA codesequences look a little like the digital codes seen in The Matrix movie series,and that is no surprise when DNA is digital in nature on one level. DNA is asoftware program that offers Consciousness a particular experience called ‘beinghuman’. An article in The San Francisco Chronicle said: ‘DNA is a universalsoftware code. From bacteria to humans, the basic instructions for life arewritten with the same language.’ Knowing this will be very important when I cometo describe the genetic software of the families that seek to control us. We areaware of the holographic expression of DNA, but in its base form it is aninformation field. It is also a receiver–transmitter which interacts with theCosmic Internet and can connect us with many dimensions of frequency outside thetiny frequency range of visible light. You would expect a receiver–transmitterto involve crystals in some way, and it turns out that the human body isbasically a liquid crystal. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is crystalline, andthe membrane of every one of our some 70 trillion cells is a liquid crystal.Earth is vastly crystalline, because it is also receiving and transmitting. DNAis a monumental receiver–transmitter of information, as this Internet articlepointed out:image [../Images/00069.jpg] Figure 53: The arrangement of DNA codes dictates the physical form > From the characteristic form of this giant molecule – a wound double helix –> the DNA represents an ideal electromagnetic antenna. On one hand it is> elongated and thus a blade which can take up very well electrical pulses. On> the other hand, seen from above, it has the form of a ring and thus is a very> magnetical antenna. We connect to the Cosmic Internet vibrationally, electrically, digitally andholographically. DNA is at the heart of this and it has been described as a‘biological Internet’. Mainstream science ridiculously labels between 90 and 97per cent of DNA (depending on who you talk to) ‘junk DNA’. They do this becausethey have no idea what it does and, from their version of reality, it appears toserve no function. I would say that there are two main reasons for ‘junk DNA’.One is that some of it has been purposely ‘switched off’ for reasons I will getto later in the book. The second is that large swathes of ‘junk DNA’ areinteracting with other realities and also following a preprogrammed softwarecode which, again, I will explain in due course. Russian scientists havediscovered that DNA can create magnetised ‘wormholes’ – tunnels of communicationwith other levels of the Universe beyond what we call space and time. PjotrGarjajev, a Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist, has done some greatwork in this field. He and his associates across many disciplines haveestablished that DNA is involved with data storage and communication as well asits genetic functions. It is a superconductor able to operate at bodytemperature and not at the extremely low temperatures necessary for theartificial variety. Superconductors can carry very large amounts of electricityfor a very long time without losing energy in the form of heat. I read anarticle on superconductors that said: ‘The future of superconductivity researchis to find materials that can become superconductors at room temperature. Oncethis happens, the whole world of electronics, power and transportation will berevolutionized.’ DNA does exactly that, but this knowledge has been suppressedaround the world to stop human awareness being revolutionised. The Russiansconfirmed that DNA can be reprogrammed by words and frequencies. These arereally the same thing. Words are frequencies. The Russian team discovered thatDNA follows similar patterns of grammar and rules to those found in humanlanguages and that this could be the origin of language communication.Experiments showed that DNA can be healed simply through vibrations and words.But that must be so. DNA is a crystalline receiver–transmitter and its basestate is waveform, as with everything in the Universe. The ability to change DNAby vibrational means will all be seriously relevant later when I explain how theControl System works from the depths of the rabbit hole where, to my knowledge,no one has ever been before.The Russian team says that this greater understanding of DNA’s role as areceiver–transmitter can explain intuition, clairvoyance, telepathy, spontaneoushealing and self-healing, and how humans can influence the weather and eachother. These are all phenomena of DNA either receiving or transmitting as itinteracts with the multilevelled Cosmic Internet. The team realised that livingDNA chromosomes ‘function just like solitonic/holographic computers using … DNAlaser radiation’. Yessssss. Exactly! I have known all this since 2003 from theinformation that came to me on the subject in many forms following my experiencewith the ‘voice’ in Brazil. ‘Solitonic’ refers to a pulse-like wave that ‘doesnot dissipate and can travel long distances with little loss of energy orstructure’. In short, we are looking at a holographic biological and waveformreceiver–transmitter computer system. The Russian research group successfullytransmitted information patterns from one DNA to another and changed the form itwas manifesting. They transformed frog embryos to salamander embryos in oneexperiment by transmitting salamander DNA information patterns. This will bevery significant when I come to the subject of ‘shapeshifing’ and themanipulation of human genetics. We can communicate with our DNA and healourselves. This is where the theme of ‘mind over matter’ comes from. There is nomatter so there is no need to have your mind over it. We only need to useConsciousness to communicate on the right frequency with another form ofConsciousness – DNA. The Hidden Hand behind human affairs knows all of this. DNAis being targeted by all manner of means to enslave us in the vibrational box offive-sense ignorance when we should be so much more. DNA is being influenced bythe words that we hear, and by radiation. Mothers are giving birth to babieswith horrific genetic defects after being subjected to the depleted uranium inAmerican, British and NATO bombs and missiles dropped on their countries. Theradiation has scrambled their DNA. The cumulative effect of exposure toradiation in all its forms, including full-body scanners, mobile phones andnuclear ‘accidents’ like the one at Fukushima in Japan can be devastating toDNA, and therefore to our health. But, on the other hand, thereality-transforming potential of DNA is incredible when it is allowed tofunction in anything like its natural state.TIME’S UPMost people are obsessed and controlled by what is known as ‘time’. ‘What’s thetime?’ ‘Is that the time?’ ‘I’m running out of time.’ ‘I have time on my hands.’‘The time has flown.’ But, like ‘space’, there is no ‘time’. It is simplyinformation encoded into the waveform fabric of the Universe which we decode astime. The way we decode it dictates how fast or slow ‘time’ appears to ‘pass’.Information on a software disk can appear on the computer screen as picturesthat seem to have space and time. The sequence moves from stage to stage and itseems like ‘time’ is moving forward. The scenes appear to have distance andperspective. But all of this is only information on a disk being read by thecomputer. This is what we do with regard to ‘space’ and ‘time’. When scientiststalk about ‘space–time’ or the ‘space–time continuum’, they are talking aboutsomething akin to a computer game being decoded to appear as ‘space’ and ‘time’.It’s all illusion. We perceive almost unimaginable ‘distances’ between stars andplanets when we look at the night sky when the whole scene exists only in ourdecoding system. There is no ‘distance’ or ‘space’ – only one infiniteeverything in which infinity and a pin head are the same. How can time as wemeasure it be ‘real’ when you can pass an invisible line in the ocean and gointo tomorrow; or go the other way and enter yesterday? The so-called‘international dateline’ is not even straight. It wanders all over the place toaccommodate locations that wish to be in yesterday or tomorrow (Fig 54). TheGregorian calendar that most people use to chart ‘time’ throughout the ‘year’ isa joke. It is only there because Pope Gregory XIII signed a decree in 1582 thatdecided this would be. They had to follow September 2nd with September 14th tomake it all fit when it was first introduced. Eleven days just disappeared!image [../Images/00070.jpg] Figure 54: What we call ‘clock-time’ is an illusory construct and yet itdominates the lives of billions www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com] There is only one moment – what is known as the NOW. Everything happens in thatmoment. There is no other. Most people would see the NOW as the ‘present’ on thejourney from ‘past’ to ‘future’. But there is no past and future; there is onlythe NOW. ‘Oh, but’ people cry, ‘there must be a past and future.’ Okay, when wetalk about the ‘past’, where are we? In the NOW. When we talk about the‘future’, where are we? In the NOW. Everything happens, and can only happen, inthe NOW. But our power to impact upon the NOW is constantly diluted by livingmentally and emotionally in the ‘past’ (regret, resentment, guilt, evennostalgia) and the ‘future’ (ambition, anxiety, fear of what is to ‘come’).‘Past’ and ‘future’ are states of mind and emotion, not states of ‘fact’. Peoplehave a very different relationship with reality when they go into any form ofdeep meditation and move beyond the realm of perceived ‘time’. This happened tome in the stone circle in Peru, in the rainforest in Brazil and on endlessoccasions since. Another important point here is that while body–mind operatesin illusory ‘time’, Consciousness is a state of no-time – the NOW. This alonecan massively contribute to the disconnection of communication and awarenessbetween body–mind and Consciousness, and this is a major reason why humansociety is founded in so many ways on clock-watching. I am not saying thatpeople should ignore clock ‘time’ and date ‘time’ if they need to interact withothers welded to the existence of ‘time’. I am saying that when people make adate to ‘meet at four o’clock’, they are aware that it is an illusory moment andjust another term for the NOW. Acknowledging the illusion for what it is loosensits grip upon your sense of reality. The NOW is the only moment that we can meetanyone whether we call it four o’clock or twenty-past six. I was told throughpsychic, Betty Shine, in 1990 that time as we perceive it would eventuallyappear to move so quickly that it would be frightening; and there are certainlymany people now who are feeling that ‘time’ is speeding up.image [../Images/00071.jpg] Figure 55: ‘Time’ is like watching a DVD – our sense of the ‘present’ is onlywhere the disc is being read at that moment; but this also dictates our sense ofthe ‘past’ (the scenes we have watched) and the ‘future’ (the scenes we have yetto watch) Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) I have written extensively over the years about something that I call the ‘TimeLoop’ and I even wrote a book called Tales from the Time Loop. The termdescribes the circular way that the Universe, as we experience it, ‘moves’through a sequence and returns pretty much back to the start. We don’t realisethis when we only experience a small section of the ‘loop’ called a ‘lifetime’.We seem to be moving from ‘past’ to ‘future’. Ancient societies such as those inAsia, and the Mayan people in Central America, believed that ‘time’ goes aroundin a circle involving different periods, epochs or ‘yugas’, in which the lifeexperience is very different. They say that some epochs/yugas allow for greatexpansion of awareness and are often referred to as the ‘Golden Age’. Others are‘dark’ periods of oppression, suppression and ignorance, according to this view.They each offer different experiences, and Consciousness chooses where it wishesto join the ‘ride’, or at least that is the way it seems. I will, however, beadding a ‘Big But’ to this towards the end of the book. Those of us ‘here’ todayhave chosen to experience the cusp of an enormous transformation of awarenessamong many other things. You might see a contradiction in saying that time isillusory and yet also circular, but there is no paradox here. The ‘Time Loop’ isthe holographic level of perception as we decode information in the NOW into anapparent sequence of events. It would look like a ‘loop’ if you could see thewhole thing in the holographic realm. But the holographic is only a decodedprojection of the waveform information construct and this information does not‘move’ in a circle; it resonates in the NOW. It goes through a vibrationalsequence of changing information, and as we decode that into holographic realitywe appear to be moving from past to future. But we’re not. The ‘Time Loop’ is,once again, an illusion created by the way we decode and experience reality.Every part of the ‘loop’, whether you call it an epoch or yuga exists in thesame NOW. ‘Time’ is like viewing a movie on DVD (Fig 55). The scene you arewatching (experiencing) is your perception of the ‘present’; those you havewatched are your sense of the ‘past’; and those you have yet to watch are the‘future’. But the whole movie exists at the same ‘time’ – NOW. Your fix on‘where’ you are ‘in time’ is dictated by the information the laser is decodingat any point. The Time Loop is the same, but it is an interactivevirtual-reality ‘game’. We can change reality when we interact with it, as itcan change us. If we retain a connection to Consciousness we can access fargreater insight into what is happening in the Time Loop. If we are entrapped inmind–body we can become lost and bewildered in a strange and crazy ‘world’ inwhich we don’t know who we are, where we are, or what the hell we are actuallyexperiencing (Figs 56 and 57).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE TIME LOOP image [../Images/00072.jpg] image [../Images/00073.jpg]Figures 56 and 57: The Time Loop when we retain a connection to Consciousness isa very different experience compared with when we don’t Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you think all that is far-out, get this: Nothing is made, built orconstructed in the way that we perceive it with a series of actions or eventstaking place that lead to an outcome – a car, house or strawberry yoghurt. Thecar, house and strawberry yoghurt are created first and the apparent sequence ofactions and events that appear to ‘make’ them in our perception of reality comesafter they are manifested by thought in their completed form in the unseenrealms of waveform – the ‘Metaphysical Universe’. I say ‘after’, but it isreally all happening in the same infinite NOW. The mind-body computer and humanprogrammed perception cannot understand, decode or know that level of awarenessand potential when something can be manifested in a flash from the power ofthought, imagination and Consciousness. So we decode a sequence of actions andevents that lead us through the process of ‘physical’ (holographic) creationthrough car factories, house builders, dairies, and so on. ‘Here is a car’becomes ‘build me a car’. The same applies to personal experiences. The‘outcome’ has already happened and the sequence to ‘get’ there (the‘time-frame’) is constructed by mind-body to satisfy the limits of its sense ofthe possible and our belief in the literal existence of ‘time’. We are alsoencouraged to do this ‘time-framing’ by the human Control System and DNAprograms in ways that I will come to later in the book. Deep, eh? But that ishow far we are in daily human perception from understanding – remembering – thetrue nature of self and reality. When I say it is all an illusion – I meanillusion.WHOLE BRAIN OR PEA-BRAIN?We cannot understand human society and the way we decode this prison realitywithout an awareness of the two ‘personalities’, or hemispheres, of the brainand how they function. We have the left-brain and the right-brain with a bridgecalled the corpus callosum connecting the two. This bridge is supposed to allowthe two hemispheres to ‘talk’ to each other, work together and make us‘whole-brained’ (Figs 58 and 59). Most people are not, however. The structureand nature of human society is specifically directed at preventing that. Thefunctions of the two sides of the brain are very different. The left-brain is‘logical and rational’ in its definition of logical and rational. It decodesinformation in the NOW into a sequence. This is basically where ‘time’ comesfrom. The quicker the left-brain advances this sequence, the faster time seemsto pass, and vice versa. The left hemisphere is ‘analytical and objective’ (itonly exists if I can see it, hear it, touch it, taste it or smell it).Crucially, it decodes reality as parts rather than as a single whole. Theleft-brain gives us the perception of everything being apart from everythingelse with ‘space’ in between. It creates structures – loves ‘em – and decodeslanguage. I have just described the world as it is currently ‘lived’. We live ina left-brain reality and this has been manipulated to be so. In the right-brainlives the maverick – the random and intuitive, the artist and creativeinspiration of all kinds. The right-brain brings everything together. Itperceives ‘wholes’, not parts. The left-brain sees individual dots, but theright brain can see how they fit together. Left-brain-dominated people controlscience, academia, medicine, politics, big business, religion, media and themilitary. These, in turn, act as the soldiers at the gate to the collectiveleft-brain and work to keep right-brain reality at bay. Left-brain rules, OK?Neil Hague’s excellent portrayal of the left-brain ‘firewall’ in Figure 60captures the essence of how most of humanity, and certainly the overwhelmingmajority of those in positions of influence and power, are entrapped in the lefthemisphere. This is the realm of apartness, structure, language and what passesfor ‘logic’. This is where the Control System wants us. They don’t want humanright-brains connecting the dots and seeing the picture; or expressingspontaneity and uniqueness when uniformity and conformity are essential to themass control of the many by the few. Look at how large numbers of sheep are keptin order through daily conformity by a single shepherd (authority) and asheepdog (fear). The sheep would be uncontrollable in this way if they expressedtheir uniqueness and spontaneity. Instead, they just repeat the same behaviour.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [../Images/00074.jpg] image [../Images/00075.jpg]Figures 58 and 59: The two hemispheres of the brain with the corpus callosum‘bridge’; and Neil Hague’s symbolic portrayal of their very different natures Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Human society is structured specifically to enslave us in the left side of thebrain by rewarding the left-brainers and marginalising the right-brainers. Thisis so obvious with ‘education’. We are now seeing even pre-school children beingintroduced to academic-type information to stimulate the left-brain and toreduce the period of ad-lib play that opens the imagination and stimulates theright side of the brain. ‘Education’ targets the left-brain with academicinformation (much of it plain wrong) and then demands that the child or studentrepeats on the exam paper what the system has told them is ‘real’. If you can dothis very well, you pass your examinations (examination of your perception ofreality). This qualifies you to attend college or university to put you in debtfor most of your life to pay back the fees. The same process of left-braininformation repeated on exam papers now ensues at a ‘higher’ level (ofprogramming). Then you go off into the world with your ‘good grades’ and‘degree’ (degree of programming) and you could choose to be a scientist, doctor,teacher or a professor like Dogma Dawkins. This involves still more memorisingof the system’s version of reality in the left side of the brain, and still moreexaminations to check how deeply your sense of reality has been hijacked. Thevast majority of people who have been through this sausage machine areimprisoned in the left-brain for the rest of their lives. These same left-brainprisoners are appointed to run and direct the administration of the institutionsof science, medicine and government etc., to maintain and expand theleft-brain-prison society. Politics is dominated by left-brainers; so isscience, medicine and the media. Most ‘journalists’ are no more than left-brainjailbirds reporting the beliefs, decisions and actions of their fellow inmates.Mainstream scientists are never going to grasp the nature of reality throughtheir left-brain lenses or microscopes when what they really need to see is thateverything is connected to everything else. The left-brain can’t grasp (decode)that. How can left-brain ‘journalists’ tell us what is really going on in theworld when you need to see wholes and not only parts to understand how the dotsconnect? Religions are structures of the left-brain with their hierarchy anddogma. The left and right hemispheres are not ‘good guy’ and ‘bad guy’. Theyshould be working together so we have the best of both. You see far-out creativepeople who are so dominated by right-brain reality that they cannot function inleft-brain society. The right hemisphere is also open to hypnotic suggestion andprogramming. This is not about one or the other, but both working in unison.This is the last thing the Control System wants. There are people known as‘autistic savants’ who can achieve extraordinary feats of the mind. Well,extraordinary to those who see human potential in such limited terms. StephenWiltshire, an ‘autistic savant’ in the UK, is famous for drawing whole citiesfrom the air after only a short time looking out from a helicopter window. In1987, when he was only 12, the BBC flew him over London for half an hour and hewas not allowed to make notes or take photographs. He came down and drew Londonfrom the air in incredible detail that included 200 buildings (Fig 61). Theirhundreds of windows were accurately portrayed even though his autism meant thathe couldn’t count. You can see Stephen’s work at: www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk[http://www.stephenwiltshire.co.uk]. Daniel Tammet is another British ‘autisticsavant’ capable of exceptional mental abilities. He can process mathematicalcalculations at computer-like speed and learns languages, even the mostchallenging ones, amazingly quickly. He was once challenged by a televisionprogramme to learn Icelandic in a week – and he did. His language teacherdescribed him as a ‘genius’ and ‘not human’. Ah, but he is human. He is thehuman we once were and will be again when those who have genetically, mentallyand emotionally enslaved us get their backsides out of here. The foundation ofthese apparently extraordinary abilities is they take a right-brain picture of ascene or language as one whole. While left-brain people are breaking a languagedown into syllables or trying to remember individual buildings, these guys justgo ‘click-gotcha’.image [../Images/00076.jpg] Figure 60: The Control System has guards at the gate to stop right-brain realityawakening the left-brain prison.

She woke up one morning feeling not too well, but she decided towork through her malaise and headed for the exercise machine. Jill looked at herhands gripping the bar and they appeared to be ‘primitive claws’. Her whole bodybegan to look very different. She said that it felt as if her consciousness hadshifted away from her ‘normal’ reality, in which she was the one having theexperience, into another perception in which she was a witness observing thatexperience. She later realised that she was having a stroke in the left side ofher brain, which, as it malfunctioned, was no longer decoding reality into theworld she thought she was living ‘in’. Look at what she said. She changed frombeing the one having the experience to becoming the one witnessing theexperience. Remember what I said about Consciousness observing through thebody–computer in the same way that we observe and interact with the Internetthrough a desktop computer? Jill said that she could no longer define where herbody ended and the rest of the room began. ‘The atoms and the molecules of myarm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall, she said. ‘All I coulddetect was this energy.’ What she called her ‘brain chatter’ then went silent:‘It was like someone had taken a remote control and pushed the mute button.’This is an important point. Most people have this chatter and gossip runningthrough their minds. It constructs scenarios that cause worry, anxiety or angerwhen they will never actually happen. But most of this constant blah, blah, blahis not YOU – Consciousness. It is the mind–body biological computer whichliterally has a mind of its own. Stop for a moment and mentally detach from thechatter and simply observe it. The observer is who you are. Everything else,including the brain chatter, is the experience. The Infinite is all-knowing,still and silent All Possibility, and Jill Bolte Taylor found that her new worldof silence was a wonderful place to be: > I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of energy around me. And> because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous> and expansive. I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was> beautiful there … > … Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain> chatter that connects you to the external world. So here I am in this space> and any stress related to me, to my job, it was gone. And I felt lighter in my> body. And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and the many> stressors related to any of those, they were gone. I felt a sense of> peacefulness … > … Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, I felt> enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle. And my> spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent> euphoria. Nirvana, I found Nirvana. I remember thinking there’s no way I would> ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny> little body. Jill was experiencing reality beyond the left-brain decoding system, but whenshe returned from what she called ‘La La Land’ she realised that she had a bigproblem and she needed to deal with it. She couldn\"t remember the telephonenumber at work, so she searched for a business card. As she thumbed through apile of cards, she could not see the ‘physical’ level of them – only pixels.Yes, pixels, the smallest single components in a digital image. The malfunctionin her left-brain had caused her decoding system to malfunction. She was nowseeing the digital level of reality. Craig Hogan, an American physicist, said inthe New Scientist article about holograms that at a certain level ofmagnification ‘the fabric of space–time becomes grainy and is ultimately made oftiny units rather like pixels …’ It took Jill 45 minutes to relate the pixelsquiggles on the card to those on the phone and that was only possible becauseof ‘brief waves of clarity’. The rest of the time ‘the pixels of the words onthe business cards blended with pixels of the background and the pixels of thesymbols’. She dialled the number and a work colleague answered, but all Jillheard was ‘whoo, whoo, whoo’. She replied, or thought she did, with, ‘This isJill! I need help!’ But again all she heard was ‘whoo, whoo, whoo’. She saidthey both sounded like a ‘golden retriever’. The left-brain decodes language andthe haemorrhage was preventing it from doing so. This gave Jill her ‘silentmind’ and the inability to hear (decode) language. There is no language or sounduntil the brain decodes them from vibrational information. Jill lostconsciousness, but survived, and it was an experience that changed her life.Well it would, wouldn’t it? She said: > If I have found Nirvana and I’m still alive, then everyone who is alive can> find Nirvana. And I picture a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,> compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at> any time. One other major observation from Jill Bolte Taylor’s experience: emotion. Shesaid: ‘… imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage!I felt euphoria. Euphoria was beautiful.’ It is not only the constant brainchatter that isn’t ‘us’. Most human ‘emotion’ isn’t ‘us’ either. You candramatically change someone’s emotional state with chemicals in drugs and foodadditives. So how can those emotions be ‘us’? Emotional disturbance can be seenin children who eat and drink this crap and have all the countless vaccinations.More than 40 years ago a British woman descended into extreme depression afterhaving a large number of mercury tooth fillings. The media reported hermiraculous recovery four decades later after she had the fillings removed andembarked on a mercury detoxification programme. If you had asked her duringthose years who ‘she’ was, she would have said that she was a clinicaldepressive. But she wasn’t. The mind–body computer had been imbalanced by thetoxic mercury (a waveform distortion at its base level) and caused a distortionin the way it decoded reality. We also talk about being men and women, or being‘human’. But these are our current experience, not our true self. How can ‘we’be men and women when chemical influence can change you from one to the other?People in Britain might remember the story in the media about Freaky thechicken. ‘She’ started out life as a hen laying eggs, but then an explosion oftestosterone made ‘her’ a ‘him’. Freaky grew a comb, began crowing at dawn andchasing the hens. ‘Men’ and ‘women’ are a software program. Did someone strollup to Freaky and say, ‘Hey, mate, you’re a man now – you have to crow when thesun comes up.’? No, he just did it. He was now decoding the male chicken programin the same way that we decode the human program and its sub-divisions known asraces and cultures. We are not ‘human’. We are Consciousness having a humanexperience. People who have been released from the lens of body–mind know toowell that this is the case. I have read extensively over the years about thosewho have had ‘near death’ experiences and what happened when they were freedfrom the limitations of the mind–body computer. The common themes are extremelycompelling and this one encapsulates all that I have been saying here: > … everything from the beginning, my birth, my ancestors, my children, my wife,> everything comes together simultaneously. I saw everything about me, and about> everyone who was around me. I saw everything they were thinking now, what they> thought then, what was happening before, what was happening now. There is no> time; there is no sequence of events, no such thing as limitation, of> distance, of period, of time, of place. I could be anywhere I wanted to be> simultaneously. That is who you are, and so much more. That is what we all are, and so muchmore. This is what the families and secret societies of the Control System don’twant us to know or remember. They want us to believe that we are just a little‘person’ with no power to impact significantly upon our own reality andexperience. Too bad, fellahs. Those days are drawing to an end. The near-deathor out-of-body experience described here also confirms what I have said aboutthe perceived ‘sequence’ of ‘creating’ a product or outcome when they alreadyexist – ‘There is no time; there is no sequence of events’.HEART IS THE KEYThere is one more absolutely pivotal point to make before we move on. This isabout the central importance of the heart. Most people think the heart is onlyan electrical pump that ensures that blood (information) circulates around thebody, but it is so much more than that. Research in recent years by theInstitute of HeartMath in the United States, and from other sources, hasestablished that the heart is fundamental to stabilising or destabilisingemotions and to harmonising or disharmonising the interaction between itself,the nervous system and the brain. This is the trinity of heart, mind andemotions. When they are out of sync, so are we. The heart has now been shown tohave its own innate intelligence (far more than the brain); its own nervoussystem, called the ‘heart brain’; and it has been found to be a sensory organthat decodes and encodes information. There are more nerves going from the heartto the brain than going the other way. The heart is constantly communicating tothe brain and the whole body through the nervous system, electromagnetic fields,hormones and other chemical reactions and blood pressure waves. The heart isalso an endocrine gland secreting hormones that can cure many diseases,including cancer. David Vesely, M.D. PhD, chief of endocrinology, diabetes andmetabolism at the James A. Haley VA Hospital in Tampa and a professor ofmedicine, molecular pharmacology and physiology at the University of SouthFlorida, found that heart hormones killed up to 97 per cent of all cancers incell cultures within 24 hours. We have come a long way from the heart being justan electrical pump. We feel intuition – intuitive knowing – through the heartand heart chakra vortex. The brain thinks; the heart knows. When we haveintuition about something we don’t need to sit down and use the mind to think itthrough. We just know. If you have the intuitive knowing that you need to be ina certain place tomorrow, you don’t have to ponder on the pros and cons, the ifsand buts. You just know you have to be there. The mind has to think and try towork everything out, because it doesn’t know. The heart generates 60 times theelectrical output of the brain, and connects us, through the heart chakravortex, to far higher levels of awareness. This is why intuition knows. Peopleare pressured not to ‘trust’ their intuition and to go instead with their head;but that leads only to enslavement to the patterns of conformity and repeatingbehaviour. The heart is a real genius of our decoding system and a connection toeven greater genius. The Control System has manipulated human perception so thatthe heart has been usurped by worship of the brain, the mind. A mind societylooks like the one that we are experiencing, but a heart society would be one oflove, respect, peace, harmony, incredible levels of intelligence and with adaily tidal wave of creativity and insight. People rightly talk about the‘wisdom of the heart’.My heart has been the foundation of everything I have done since I began toawaken in 1990. It has been the source of insights galore into what is happeningin the world; the reason that I will go with information A and rejectinformation B; why I will drop everything and go somewhere purely on intuitiononly to find that there was a significant reason to be there at that moment. Mybrain/mind would be kicking and cussing and telling me at first all the reasonswhy I should not do any of these things; but there came a moment soon after Ibegan my great adventure when my ‘head’ had observed enough times that when youfollow your intuitive heart it all works out, despite some challenges along theway. This was the moment when my head and my heart became one. Head and hearthave moved as one unit since then. My heart says, ‘I feel to do this,’ and myhead says, ‘Okay, let’s go.’ What I intuitively feel – know – and what I think,are the same. There is a war within most people between their head and theirheart, and the head normally wins. It is time to change that, and in doing sochange the world from a prison to a paradise. The Control System targets theheart more than anything else. The manipulators work to suppress the connectionto heart intelligence, wisdom and knowing. This is vital if they are to imprisonhumanity in the ‘head’ – five-sense reality. One of the ways they do this is bymanipulating events to trigger states of low-vibrational, imbalanced emotion.They want us angry, frustrated, fearful, resentful, depressed and irritable.They want us to close our heart and make it a bystander in the process ofdecoding reality and perception. Considerable research has shown that theseemotional states generate incoherent – imbalanced – heart rhythm patterns. This,in turn, distorts the relationship between the heart, nervous system and brain,and all hell can break lose mentally, emotionally and ‘physically’. Now we cansee why heart disease is one of the biggest killers on Planet Earth – heartrhythm incoherence. The heart can only take so much before it’s up and out ofhere. This is how stress and other emotions causes heart attacks and why peopledo die from a ‘broken heart’ when the emotional impact of a trauma or shocktriggers severe heart rhythm incoherence. This is also what causes ‘heartache’.Love, compassion, caring and appreciation have been shown to do the opposite.They lead to coherent heart rhythm patterns (Fig 62). The Institute of HeartMathhas developed techniques through which the power of the heart, in its electricaloutput alone, can be used to bring emotional balance to the body and to work inharmony with the rest of our being. I can recommend a book called TransformingAnger (Raincoast Books 2003) which is authored by Doc Childre and DeborahRozman.image [../Images/00078.jpg] Figure 62: The very different electrical heart rhythms generated by incoherentand coherent emotional states I have talked in this chapter about how we decode reality and perception throughthe brain and genetic structure from the waveform to the holographic. It istherefore appropriate that I end it by emphasising that the key to this processis the heart. This must be allowed to play its crucial role in decoding a newreality – one of love, peace, harmony and, yes, true, innate intelligence waybeyond anything that the programmed brain can deliver. The further we go in thisbook the more obvious that will be."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00079.jpg] I have been explaining how the Universe is made manifest from a waveforminformation construct that is expressed electrically, digitally andholographically. Everything in the Universe is the same, be they stars, planets,people, flowers or trees.image [../Images/00080.jpg] Figure 63: Lightning is the most obvious expression of the Electric Universe A growing band of real scientists and researchers have been working for manyyears to identity the electrical level of the Universe. I am not saying thatthey accept the existence of the waveform, digital and holographic realitiesthat I am talking about, but they have done some magnificent work to highlighthow the Universe operates electrically. Two leading researchers in this fieldare David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill. They have produced two excellent books,The Electric Universe and Thunderbolts of the Gods, which I thoroughlyrecommend. The Universe, on one level, is clearly a seething mass of electricityand electromagnetic fields. We are all familiar with lightning and we know thatthis is caused by electricity, not least because it’s blindingly obvious (Fig63). But there is far more to lightning than we think. People see electricalflashes and forks in the sky and they believe this is as far as it goes. What wedon’t see are the electrical connections from the lightning near the groundgoing up through Earth’s atmosphere to connect with the cosmic electrical fieldthat pervades the Universe. Virtually simultaneous with a lightning strike thatwe see are electrical flashes at higher altitudes that have been dubbed ‘elves’,‘sprites’, ‘gnomes’ and ‘jets’ (Fig 64). The evidence is that this electricalcircuit continues into the ionosphere in the upper region of the atmosphere andon to the solar field and the wider cosmos. Joseph Dwyer of the FloridaInstitute of Technology wrote in The Geophysical Review in 2003: ‘Theconventional view of how lightning is produced is wrong, and so the true originof lightning remains a mystery.’ Well, it does if you don’t realise that theUniverse is pervaded by electricity and electromagnetic fields and that incertain circumstances currents are discharged. The planet works like a capacitorused in electronics to gather and store electrical charge. Earth storeselectricity between its surface and the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere, andwhen the charge build-up gets too powerful the pressure has to be released. Wecall this ‘lightning’. Tornadoes are electrical phenomena and result fromrapidly-rotating electrical charges. This is the reason why tornadoes areassociated with electrical storms. The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, isalso an electrical phenomenon (Fig 65). So much is explained once you see thatwe are interacting with an electrical universe. We don’t see the electrical webmost of the time unless it reaches certain states of charge and discharge, butit is an organising and communication fabric of our experienced reality.Mainstream science has denied that electricity exists out in ‘space’ and saysthat celestial bodies are electrically neutral and move through a vacuum. Butthey accept at the same time the existence of electromagnetic fields in space.This is extraordinary when you can’t have electromagnetic fields withoutelectricity. But protecting dogma and fixed positions is far more important tothe Dogma Dawkins’ than opening their minds to the blatantly obvious. Talbottand Thornhill rightly say in The Electric Universe: ‘It has been said that thegreatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance, but the illusion of knowledge.’This is also a form of ignorance, but the point is taken. The mainstreamers talkabout the ‘vacuum’ of space and say everything is driven by gravity. I weighabout 16 stone, or 224 pounds, but I can still jump in the air very easily.Crikey, this gravity is powerful isn’t it? Talbott and Thornhill point out thatthe electrical force is about a thousand trillion, trillion, trillion times morepowerful than gravity. It is electrical and electromagnetic forces that holdeverything ‘together’ and secure planets in their repeating orbits around theSun – not gravity, which is a far weaker form of magnetism. These electricalforces, as with everything else, are information. The human brain receives andcommunicates through electrical information, and the heart beats electrically.We are interacting with the Cosmic Internet on one level through the electricUniverse.image [../Images/00081.jpg] Figure 64: There is far more to lightning than the electrical flashes we seenear the ground. It continues upwards into the cosmos image [../Images/00082.jpg] Figure 65: The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights CONSCIOUS PLASMAThe observable Universe is 99.999 per cent plasma. This is a unique substancesometimes known as ‘the fourth state of matter’. American Nobel laureate, IrvingLangmuir (1881–1957), coined the term ‘plasma’ because of its life-like abilityto self-organise as the electrical environment changes. It reminded him of bloodplasma in that electrical forces are carried in cosmic plasma in much the sameway as red and white blood corpuscles are carried in blood plasma. Cosmic plasmais ‘life-like’ because it is an expression of Consciousness. We have all seenthose plasma balls with the currents spiking out from the centre, and they giveus a feel for the most crucial contribution of plasma in manifesting our reality(Fig 66). Plasma is a near-perfect medium for electricity and electromagneticfields. When electrical currents pass through plasma, the interaction makes themspiral around each other. This creates filaments known as ‘Birkeland currents’,named after Kristian Olaf Birkeland (1867– 1917). He was a brilliant Norwegianscientist and a pioneer researcher of the electrical universe. These currentsare flowing throughout the electrical/plasma universe and some are light yearsacross while others are tiny. You can see in Figure 67[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos245669] how the currents rotate around eachother like a corkscrew and they are held apart by the very electromagneticfields that their interaction creates. This is something known as the ‘plasmapinch’. Brilliant. The same image can clearly be seen in the Double Helix Nebulanear the centre of our galaxy. And what does it remind you of? Human DNA (Fig 68[../Text/index_split_016.html#filepos246006]). This is not a coincidence. We areback to ‘as above, so below’ – the hologram. We are the Universe and theUniverse is us. We are everything and everything is us. Compare again thesimilarity between human brain activity and electrical activity in the Universe(Fig 69 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos246368]). The human auric field has‘Birkeland currents’, too, in the form of the meridians that carry the ‘chi’energy around the body. The chi is information from many sources, including theelectrical level of the Universe. Kundalini energy flowing from the base of thespine up through the main chakra system and out through the top of the head alsospirals in the same way. Kundalini has been depicted since ancient times as twointertwining snakes in a symbol called the caduceus (Fig 70[../Text/index_split_018.html#filepos246681]). The central nervous system, aholographic expression of the kundalini/chakra system, is also electrical. Weare communicating electrically with the Universe and with each other withoutknowing that we are doing so (Fig 71[../Text/index_split_018.html#filepos249751]). DNA, and the genetic structure asa whole, is fundamentally involved with this interaction and I have emphasisedthat our reality is not decoded only by the brain. Humans have a meridiannetwork carrying the chi, and the planet has the same with the network ofmeridians known as ‘ley lines’. They form a communication and interaction gridbetween Earth and the electrical and vibrational universe. Massive vortices ofelectrical and vibrational energy (information) are created where many of theseley lines intersect. Ancient initiates who had this knowledge located stonecircles, temples and ‘special’ buildings at the major vortex points. Crystallinestones were used, because their role was to receive, transmit and amplifyinformation (Fig 72 [../Text/index_split_018.html#filepos250075]). CrystallineDNA does the same.

Everything is a tapestry of interconnectedness –Oneness. When plasma infused with one kind of electrical charge meets plasma ofa different charge, a barrier is formed between the two. This is called a‘Langmuir sheath’, named after scientist Irving Langmuir. These ‘sheaths’ formthe planetary energy fields. Planets and stars are also electrical, and theirvery presence charges the plasma in a certain way. A sheath or barrier has beenformed, for example, where plasma charged by the Earth meets differently-chargedplasma out in ‘space’. We call our side of that barrier the Earth’s energy fieldor magnetosphere (Fig 73), but electrically-charged ‘plasmasphere’ would be farmore accurate. This protects Earth and its inhabitants from dangerous radiation.The Sun has its own ‘Langmuir sheath’ called the ‘heliosphere’, and this isfurther protection for the Solar System from what would be highly destructivesolar emissions. It is all a work of genius. Do we think that all this happenedby some cosmic ‘accident’? Or is it not rather more credible that it was made tobe this way by some extraordinarily advanced ‘software’ programmer? Humans havetheir own ‘magnetosphere’ known as the ‘auric field’. This operates with thesame basic principles. Our electrical presence charges plasma around usdifferently to the Earth field. We talk about people having a ‘powerful aura’ ora ‘weak aura’. This is related to the power of the charge – electromagneticenergy – that we are generating or tapping into. The Control System candisconnect us from the greater reality by manipulating our auric fields intoenergetic states that are very different to the fields that we are interactingwith. This puts us not so much in a ‘box’, but in a ‘bubble’. We have tounderstand at least the basics of how reality works before we can trulyunderstand the nature of human control. It goes way beyond the five senses.image [../Images/00088.jpg] Figure 71: The electrical levels of mind-body connect with the electrical levelsof the Universe image [../Images/00089.jpg] Figure 72: Stone circles were placed at major vortex points to interact withvibrational and electrical sources of cosmic communication image [../Images/00090.jpg] Figure 73: The Earth’s magnetosphere is created by the ‘Langmuir sheath’ whichis formed where two differently-charged plasma fields meet. © SOHO/EIT/LASCO ELECTRICAL SUNThe Sun is also made of plasma and operates very differently to what is claimedby the scientific mainstream (Fig 74). Song-sheet scientists will tell you thatthe Sun is a gigantic nuclear reactor that generates heat and light from itscore. But that is patent nonsense when you observe the evidence. The same goesfor the idea that the Sun is heading for destruction through the process ofproducing heat and light from internal nuclear reactions. But it’s not. Theyhave next to nothing to support these claims and the evidence points anotherway. No matter. This unscientific mainstream crap goes on being taught as factin schools and universities the world over. American engineer and electricuniverse researcher, Ralph Juergens, said: ‘The modern astrophysical conceptthat ascribes the sun’s energy to thermonuclear reactions deep in the solarinterior is contradicted by nearly every observable aspect of the sun.’ I cantell you after researching so many interrelated subjects since 1990 that ifmainstream science tells you anything at all – check it, big-time. The Sun is anelectrical transformer, and any nuclear reactions happen on its surface – not atits core. The Sun transforms electricity in the cosmic plasma field (the Sun is99 per cent plasma itself) into what we call ‘light’ (a particular type ofinformation). This is the same principle as an electric lightbulb, whichreceives electricity and transforms it into light. The Sun goes through cyclesof higher and lower solar activity, just as electricity in the fabric of thegalaxy goes through cycles of high ‘voltage’ and low ‘voltage’ (Fig 75). TheX-ray level of the Sun dims when solar activity falls and this is the result ofreduced electrical activity. Think of a light on a dimmer switch. When you turnthe electricity down, the light gets weaker. The Sun is not producing light frominside itself; it is taking electricity from the cosmic grid and transformingthat into ‘light’. The surface of the Sun is relatively cool compared with theimmense temperatures in the upper atmosphere. The hottest part of the Sun is thecorona – way out from the surface. The corona is the bright light that we seearound the moon at the time of a total eclipse. The difference in temperature isenormous. The temperature is less than 5,000 degrees Kelvin three hundred milesfrom the surface, rising to 200 million degrees at higher altitudes. It shouldbe the other way around if the heat and light were being generated from withinthe Sun. But it all makes sense when you realise that the Sun is processingelectricity sourced from the cosmos. We know that different parts of the Sunrotate at different speeds like a series of interacting electrical motors, and,well, just look at it (Fig 76). The Sun is a plasma ball processing electricity.Solar flares behave like lightning does. A ‘plasma doughnut’, or ‘torus’, can beclearly seen circling the solar equator when the Sun is photographed at theultraviolet level (Fig 77). This is precisely what happens with plasmaexperiments in the laboratory. The torus draws in and accumulates cosmicelectricity and this is released in the form of flares and what are called‘coronal mass ejections’. These strike the Sun’s surface and punch holes that weknow as sunspots (Fig 78). We are told that these are caused by ejections fromwithin the Sun – but the opposite is true. More energy is obviously accumulatedand released at the high end of the cosmic electrical cycle and so more flarespunch more ‘holes’, or sunspots. Thus, the number of sunspots is an indicator ofincreased solar (electrical) activity. The Sun appears to change size indifferent phases of the cycle, because its plasma ‘Langmuir sheath’ shrinks andexpands in line with electrical changes. We are also warned from time to time(and will be more so in the period ahead) that solar flares which project burstsof solar energy towards Earth could disrupt electrical technology, computer andsatellite systems. Why would that happen? Because of the electrical effect onthose electrical systems. Even NASA had to accept in 2007 that electromagneticfields were the cause of the Aurora Borealis. It was reported that:image [../Images/00091.jpg] Figure 74: The plasma ball electrical Sun image [../Images/00092.jpg] Figure 75: The electrical sun cycle image [../Images/00093.jpg] Figure 76: You only have to look at the Sun to see its electrical nature image [../Images/00094.jpg] Figure 77: The Sun torus, or ‘plasma doughnut’ image [../Images/00095.jpg] Figure 78: Sunspots are not created by internal activity, but by externalstrikes by massive charges of electricity > New data from NASA’s Themis mission … found that the energy comes from charged> particles from the Sun following like a current through twisted bundles of> electromagnetic fields connecting Earth’s upper atmosphere to the Sun. They are describing the workings of the electric Universe.‘IT’S THE ELECTRICITY, STUPID!’Electrical energy processed by the Sun is the same energy flowing through theMilky Way galaxy and causing it to spiral. As it does so, it becomes a vast discmotor which, itself, produces electricity (Fig 79). The phenomenon of swirlinggalaxies can be reproduced in the laboratory by using plasma and electricity, ascan other manifestations in the heavens, including nebulas (Fig 80). Mainstream‘scientific’ dogma about the workings of the Universe cannot be reproduced inthis way, and there is a good reason for that: the dogma is nonsense. We seecomets with their long tails of light, and this is the interaction of thecomet’s electrical field with the electrically-charged plasma field. Mainstreamscientists tell some long-winded story about comets being made of dust and icethat wasn’t used in the formation of planets. They say that the tail is causedby the effect of solar heat on the ‘ice’. Anything will do as long as they don’tuse that naughty word ‘electricity’. The science establishment says that cometsare gathered together in something called the ‘Oort cloud’ from which they enterthe Solar System from time to time. This ‘Oort cloud’ has never been observed,because it doesn’t exist. Or maybe it’s just hiding. You can’t trust thesecomets. They’re very sneaky. ‘Quick, someone’s coming – act like you’re theasteroid belt.’ Great swathes of scientific ‘fact’ are just a compendium offairy tales, and the system is structured and funded to make it so. The ControlSystem doesn’t want us to know about the reality we are experiencing. It wantsus to live our lives ignorant, confused and bewildered in order to make controlso much easier. The claim that the Universe started with the ‘Big Bang’ is aclassic example of a constantly repeated theory becoming a constantly repeated‘fact’ that is taught to each generation of children and students as ‘this ishow it is’. The theory goes that around 13.7 billion years ago, give or take aday or two, what we now call the Universe was compressed into the nucleus of anatom. They call this the ‘singularity’, and it is supposed to have happenedbefore space and time existed (they still don’t, except in their decoded form).Then came an explosion generating temperatures of trillions of degrees (‘You canturn the heating off now, Ethel’) and this ‘Big Bang’ created subatomicparticles, energy, matter, space and time. Eventually, planets and stars wereformed in a Universe that is still expanding from the force of the said ‘BigBang’. The theory was first postulated in 1927 by a Catholic priest, GeorgesLemaître (1894–1966), at the Catholic University of Louvain. He was educatedpartly by the Jesuit Order, one of the premier secret societies in the globalweb. Lemaître called his Big Bang theory the ‘hypothesis of the primeval atom’.A hypothesis since taught as fact. It has no credibility to anyone who looks atthe evidence with an open mind. One of the main ‘confirmations’ that theUniverse is still expanding from some ‘Big Bang’ is something called ‘redshift’which, to put it simply, is the belief that celestial bodies appear to be red inthe light spectrum when they are moving away due to the effect of frequencywaves. The scientific establishment confidently gave us the date of their BigBang – 13.7 billion years ago – from redshift calculations. But Edwin Hubble,the man credited with discovering redshift, said: ‘It seems likely that redshiftmay not be due to an expanding universe, and much of the speculation on thestructure of the universe may require re-examination.’ Turns out he was right.The official cause of redshift is just another assumption, and not confirmation,that the Universe is expanding in line with, and in support of, the Big Bangtheory. The redshift assumption also distorts by a fantastic degree the allegeddistances between celestial bodies. How can you go on maintaining dogmatic‘norms’ when you have been proved so spectacularly wrong so many times? Theofficial explanation of Life and the Universe is in tatters wherever you look.The theory of black holes, as postulated by mainstream science, is also out ofthe window when you start to understand the electrical forces at work. I haveused the term ‘black holes’ here and there, but in a completely differentcontext to the ‘scientific’ mainstream. I am talking about connection andcommunication channels between realities – not something that gobbles upeverything including light and denies it any escape. Interdimensional gatewaysor doorways would be a better way of putting it, like the principle ofwormholes, through which energies and vibrational information can be exchanged.We are going to realise that these connecting gateways can profoundly impactupon this reality in terms of vibrational information. They can be foundthroughout the Universe.image [../Images/00096.jpg] Figure 79: The Milky Way galaxy – a vast disc motor powered by electricalcurrents --------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [../Images/00097.jpg] image [../Images/00098.jpg]image [../Images/00099.jpg]Figure 80: A nebula in the heavens and another in a laboratory using plasmatechnology--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ASTROLOGY IS A SCIENCEThe medical establishment, and those who live in the ‘real world’ (left-brain),wave aside any suggestion that you can treat a headache with a needle in thetoe, or affect an organ by what you do to a specific point on the foot or theear. They are so ignorant that they think they’re intelligent, but they have noidea what the body really is. It’s the same with astrology, or the ancient artof ‘reading the stars’. Astrology is not an exact science, and cannot be whenthere is so much more to know about what is ‘out there’ and how it influenceshuman personality. But it is a science when practised at a deep level. Nothingoperates in electrical isolation in the electrical universe or its waveformfoundation, the Metaphysical Universe. Planets and stars are electrical innature and they impact, and are impacted upon, by interaction with theelectrically-charged plasma field. We see the ‘physical’ (holographic)visible-light frequencies of planets and stars; but they are also electrical andvibrational information fields. They are interacting with the cosmic electricaland waveform fields as they orbit the Sun and they are changing, and beingchanged by, the information in those fields. The impact is multiplied many timeswhen they come together in certain alignments, or ‘aspects’. We connect with thecosmic electrical energy and waveform fields the moment we are born (some sayconceived). The information in those fields at that moment dictates our ‘starsign’ and many more detailed astrological influences. Our astrological energyfield – how the universe was when we were born/conceived – interacts throughoutour lives with the ever-changing cosmic information grids in a different way tosomeone conceived or born at another point in the annual cycle. You often findclusters of people born in a certain (information) period who have similargifts, abilities and personalities. Astrologically, an outcome can be morefavourable if planned to coincide with certain positions of the planets and thestars (astro-logical). In the same way, we can experience resistance if theplanetary positions are not taken into consideration should they bedisharmonious. The Illuminati bloodline families and their secret societynetworks know this, while they pooh-pooh astrology in public. They planeverything they do with these universal forces in mind, waveform, electricallyand digitally, through astrology, numerology and surfing energetic cycles. Itwasn’t coincidence that they launched the war in Libya in 2011 on the samevernal equinox that they invaded Iraq in 2003. There is another aspect toastrology, too. The Universe is a hologram in which everything is a smallerversion of the whole, and so the movements and alignments of planets arehappening within our own holographic field (Fig 81). As above, so below. We arevery significantly affected and influenced by astrological forces, but, as ever,Consciousness can overcome them if it chooses to. Astrological readings that Ihave had throughout my life have shown me how much my journey for a long timewas locked into an astrological path that was worked out in great detail beforeI arrived. It was part of the ‘tramlines’ that kept me ‘on track’. It is thesame with all of us, but there comes a time when we need to break throughastrological patterns – with Consciousness. I am finding that astrologicalinfluences are less and less relevant to me. Not irrelevant, just not asrelevant. I was told by an astrologer that the date of my speaking event inTimes Square, New York, in 2010 was the worst possible day for me to do that.But the event was brilliant, the audience was brilliant, and I had a ball.WORLDS IN COLLISIONPlanets are maintained in their orbits by electrical and electromagnetic forces– not by ‘gravity’. Anything that disrupts or distorts those forces is going tocause mayhem and likely catastrophe as the planets go ‘walkabout’. This hascertainly happened many times in our part of the Universe. There have been aseries of cataclysmic events in the Solar System, including one that affectedthe entire galaxy. It seems that our Milky Way galaxy ‘collided’ with itsnearest large and separate galaxy neighbour, Andromeda, which is today,apparently, the farthest object that can be seen with the naked eye. Most peoplewill dismiss the idea of galaxies colliding, but in 1994 astronomers discoveredthat what they call a ‘dwarf galaxy’ is colliding with the Milky Way now. TheAndromeda collision was way back beyond any ‘time’ recorded by humans, and theEarth and the Solar System were not even where they are now before all thishappened. The waveform construct of the galaxy was imbalanced by what happenedand the ‘clean-up’ and ‘clear-up’ began by the creator-consciousness thatestablished the ‘game’. Worlds were repaired and species reseeded. This was notdone by ‘physical’ means, but by reprogramming the ‘game’ at the waveform levelof the information construct. Waveform realities (the ‘Cosmic Internet’) arebeamed from the centre of the galaxy and ‘picked up’ by receivers in sync withthe different ranges of frequency. The main ‘receivers’ and ‘decoders’ are thesuns, and their broadcasts are picked up by planets, people, animals, plant lifeand so on. A galaxy and a universe have to be observed (decoded) into aholographic state like everything else. Vibrational/electrical upheavalsdelivered into this Solar System some ‘outsiders’, including Jupiter and Saturn.These are not planets, but a form of star or sun known as ‘brown dwarfs’. Thereare many types of dwarf stars – some ‘light up’ and some don’t. Saturn andJupiter are made up of the elements hydrogen and helium – just like the Sun.Some scientists have described brown dwarfs as ‘failed stars’ and I suppose youcould say they are in a kind of middle category between a planet and afully-fledged sun or star. I will refer to them as ‘suns’ to keep it simplebecause they are much closer to that than a planet. Brown dwarfs were onlydiscovered in 1995 and scientists have suggested that there may be as many browndwarf stars as there are stars as we know them. So it is no big deal to have atleast two in our vicinity. I know that scientists and astronomers will say thatSaturn and Jupiter don’t quite fit their criteria of a brown dwarf, but theyonly confirmed the existence of brown dwarfs well under 20 years ago and theyare going to have to widen their criteria to encompass more bodies than theycurrently do. It is important to remember that knowledge of the Universe isstill in its infancy. Scientists and astronomers believed not long ago that theMilky Way was the only galaxy in the Universe. It was only as recently as the1920s that astronomer, Edwin Hubble, showed this to be outrageously inaccurate.People think they are looking at a stable and unchanging solar system when thisis not the case at all. The Universe and everything in it is constantlychanging. Galaxies attract dwarf galaxies and eventually absorb them into theirown system. The Milky Way is orbited by two dwarf galaxies and we are closer tothe centre of one of them, the Canis Major dwarf galaxy, than we are to our own.I have seen reports that the red supergiant star, Betelgeuse, in theconstellation of Orion, is due to explode into what is called a ‘supernova’ andwill appear from Earth as a second sun. I mentioned Betelgeuse in Human Race GetOff Your Knees with regard to Zulu legends about its place in human history. TheUniverse is always in a state of transition, movement and change. Our solarsystem is a real mish-mash or hodgepodge that came together as a result of manycatastrophic events, and the Earth is not originally from ‘these parts’, either.image [../Images/00100.jpg] Figure 81: The holographic nature of ‘physical’ reality means that the humanmind–body is a smaller version of the Solar System and the Universe Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) Russian–American scholar, Immanuel Velikovsky, and more recently Americanresearcher, David Talbott, have provided new insights into what has happened inthe Solar System in relatively recent times. Talbott was inspired onto this pathby the late Velikovsky’s pioneering work. They have both combined scientificresearch with ploughing through reams and reams of ancient accounts from everypart of the world about the time, to quote the title of one book on the subject,when the Earth nearly died. The Solar System was very different to the one thatwe know today before these cataclysmic events. Velikovsky wrote a series ofbooks starting in the 1950s, including Worlds in Collision; Ages in Chaos; andEarth in Upheaval. He didn’t get everything right – who does? But I’m sure thathis themes and those of David Talbott are correct. I might disagree on exactlywhen it happened, and other detail, but the fact that something of greatenormity did happen is patently obvious. I have been writing about this fornearly the last two decades and it was one of the first subject areas that cameto me soon after my experience with Betty Shine in 1990. Velikovsky deserves ourrespect and congratulations for his trailblazing 60 years ago, and for stickingwith it amid merciless ridicule and dismissal. I know the feeling. I’ll staywith the themes rather than get bogged down with differing views of the detail.Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn were much closer before the cataclysms than theyare today and they appeared as giant bodies to people on Earth. Saturn was asun, or brown dwarf star, and did not have the rings that we see today. I’llexplain how I am saying they came to be a little later. I have come across anumber of accounts over the years of the ‘two-sun’ solar system, and more than80 per cent of known solar systems have multiple suns. The Ancient Greeks saidthat Earth once had two suns, and they had two words for ‘sun’: Theos and Helios– which did not refer to the same body. The concept was featured in the StarWars movie series produced by Illuminati insider, George Lucas (Fig 82). I havealso suggested in other books, such as The Biggest Secret, that at least manypeople of the white, or Caucasian, race have historical connections with Mars.An ‘insider’ who worked on many secret science programmes told me that he hadbeen taken to an underground extraterrestrial base on Mars and that the entitieslooked virtually identical to humans. He said that he’d had to look closelybefore he could see minor differences. David Talbott’s research concludes thatVenus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbited our sun together in a straightline. This made it appear from Earth that Venus was in the centre of the sun –the Saturn sun (Fig 83). Talbott suggests that the ancient symbol of the sun, acircle at the centre of a much larger circle, derives from this (Fig 84). Hesays that Mars appeared to be in the centre of Venus when viewed from Earth andthat Jupiter was obscured by Saturn. Talbott produced a DVD outlining his ideascalled Remembering the End of the World and you can currently get a copy at:www.thunderbolts.info [http://www.thunderbolts.info]. The cutting edge has movedon since this was made and he began to study the electrical nature of theUniverse; but all the foundation themes are there. Saturn didn’t appear to movefrom the perspective of Earth and so it was called the ‘Steadfast One’. Talbottsays that something happened that caused Mars to move in a vertical line closerto Earth and then go back the other way. Mars eventually came so close thatstupendous electrical discharges were exchanged with the Earth – thethunderbolts of the gods recorded universally in ancient myth and legend (Fig85). Mars became forever known as the ‘god of war’. Electromagnetic stabilitywas now electromagnetic chaos and Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn went theirseparate ways. Venus is recorded as a comet-like body with ‘long hair’ – theresult of the electrical interaction between an out-of-control Venus and theplasma field. It is possible that images like the one in Figure 86 from ancientEgypt may be symbolising what was seen in the sky.image [../Images/00101.jpg] Figure 82: Two suns rise in the Star Wars series. image [../Images/00102.jpg] Figure 83: David Talbott’s view of how Saturn, Venus and Mars would have lookedwhen viewed from the Earth in the solar system before the cataclysms Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00103.jpg] Figure 84: David Talbott suggests that this sun symbol relates to the sunSaturn, rather than the sun we are familiar with image [../Images/00104.jpg] Figure 85: Neil Hague’s portrayal of the Earth-Mars ‘thunderbolts of the gods’ © Neil Hague 2011 ‘FALLEN’ EARTHThe Earth, too, was devastated, and all of this is recorded in ancient myths andlegends across the world. They describe a time before the cataclysm of a ‘GoldenAge’ of harmony when there was no discord or war, no reference to time, and noseasons. It was like an eternal spring of constant abundance. Many legends speakof Atlantis and Mu, or Lemuria, as great continents in the Atlantic and Pacificthat sank beneath the sea amid enormous geological upheavals leaving onlyremnants such as the Pacific islands and even the massive landmass of Australia.It is clear from the geological and biological record that there wereearthquakes, volcanoes and tidal waves on a scale we could not imagine today. Aperiod that keeps recurring with regard to this is between 11,500 and 13,000years ago, but there has been far more than just one case of planetary upheaval.The biblical ‘Great Flood’ story is repeated across the world using differentnames for the heroes and gods, and the story of Noah is a re-write of much olderstories from ancient Sumer and Babylon, now Iraq. The Sumerian version tells howextraterrestrial ‘gods’, the Anunna, or Anunnaki, decided to destroy humanity;but one of them, called Enki, warned the priest-king Ziusudra of the comingflood. He told Ziusudra to build a great ship and take aboard ‘beasts andbirds’. The same story was told in the later Babylon, where the ‘Noah’ figurewas called Atrahasis; and we can also find The Flood story in Egypt, Assyria,Chaldea, Greece, Arcadia, Rome, Scandinavia, Germany, Lithuania, Transylvania,Turkey, Persia, China, New Zealand, Siberia, Burma, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines,Sumatra, in Islam and in Celtic lore, and among native peoples throughout North,South and Central America, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. They tell ofa great heat that boiled the sea; mountains breathing fire; the disappearance ofthe Sun and Moon, and the darkness that followed; the raining down of blood, iceand rock; the Earth flipping over; the sky falling; the rising and sinking ofland; the loss of great continents; and the coming of the ice. They nearly alltell of a wall of water, a gigantic tsunami that swept across the planet. I reada book a long time ago by two researchers, D S Allan and J B Delair, called Whenthe Earth Nearly Died. They compared ancient accounts with the biological andgeological record and one supported and confirmed the other. Anthony L Peratt isone of the world’s leading research scientists on high-energy plasma discharges.He made a remarkable discovery when he compared laboratory-repeated plasmadischarges that would have been generated by the events that I have describedwith cave paintings, or petroglyphs, recorded by nearly all races in every partof the world. The image of ‘Squatter Man’ or ‘Stick Man’ is game, set and matchwhen compared with how one form of plasma discharge would have looked in thesky. I wanted to include the comparison in the book here, but I could not getpermission from Anthony L Peratt. However, if you put ‘Plasma Squatter Man’ intoGoogle images you can see it there.image [../Images/00105.jpg] Figure 86: A portrayal of the electrical cosmos interacting with the atmosphereof Venus and the crown of Ankhsunamun’s ‘comet’ on the throne of Tutankhamun ©(esa/c. Carreau) Most people have no idea how relatively-recently extraordinary events happened.The islands of the Azores are on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is connected to afracture line that continues for a distance of 40,000 miles. It is one of themost active regions for earthquakes and volcanoes such as those more recently inIceland that have disrupted air travel. The Eurasian, African, North Americanand Caribbean tectonic plates meet here and so it can be extremely unstable. TheAzores are said by some to be a remnant of Atlantis; and the ancient Greekphilosopher, Plato (427–347 BC), seems to suggest in his writings that the endof Atlantis was about 11,000 years ago. Tachylite lava disintegrates in seawaterwithin 15,000 years, but it is still found on the seabed around the Azores.Beach-sand gathered from depths of 10,500 to 18,440 feet shows that the seabedin this region must have been above sea level in geologically recent times.Oceanographer, Maurice Ewing, wrote in National Geographic: ‘Either the landmust have sunk two or three miles, or the sea must once have been two or threemiles lower than now. Either conclusion is startling.’ The Appalachia land mass,which connected today’s Europe, North America, Iceland and Greenland, appears tohave broken up in the same period as the upheavals around the Azores. TheHimalayas, Alps and Andes only reached their present height around 11,000 to13,000 years ago. Lake Titicaca on the Peruvian–Bolivian border is now said tobe the highest navigable lake in the world at some 13,000 feet; but around13,000 years ago much of that region was at sea level. Fish fossils are foundhigh up in mountain ranges, supporting the legends of mountains being splitapart and others surging from the Earth. Does anyone still seriously believethat the Grand Canyon in Arizona was scored away by the Colorado River? Youwould laugh at the very thought if you stood at the edge of that canyon andlooked down at the tiny river way in the distance. I have been there a few timesand it still makes me chuckle. How ludicrous! A tidal wave of the magnitudeuniversally described would have generated pressures on the Earth’s surface oftwo tonnes per square inch – the kind of pressure that creates artificial stonetoday. It would have caused things to fossilise within hours and caused theformation of mountains. This explains why still intact trees have been foundfossilised. This could never have happened unless it was done amazingly quickly.Parts of the Earth were instantly frozen, and mammoths have been found in icestill standing up in the process of eating, with undigested food still in theirstomachs. Random rocks and stones scattered across the Earth are the result ofthe global tsunami and it also explains why botanist, Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov,studied more than 50,000 wild plants and found that they originated in onlyeight different areas – all of them high up in mountains. Plato wrote thatagriculture began at high elevations after the lowlands were covered by a flood.All these accounts with their common themes that support each other were writtenoff as the fiction of a primitive people, but they are now being taken far moreseriously as the geological and biological record gives them ever more credence.There is further support, too, from the emerging understanding of theelectrical/plasma universe. We can see that if something seriously distorts thebalance of the electromagnetic forces that maintain the spheres in a stableorbit then they will hit the road.The Earth took a long time to recover, and life here has never been the samesince in far more than just a ‘physical’ or holographic sense. The foundationconstruct of our experienced reality is waveform information, and what happenedcaused a serious distortion – or what I call ‘the Schism’ – in the waveforminformation fabric of our part of the Universe. The human mind is connected tothis information source and so the Schism also affected humanity’s mental andemotional balance. This continues today in the distortions in the way thatpeople view self, life and each other. The timeless Golden Age was over. Time aswe know it was about to imprison human perception through the manipulation thatI will be describing. Emotions like hate and greed appeared in a world that hadnot known them in the period of the Golden Age. The few humans that survived andthose that followed were cast into a dark and merciless age of ignorance andsuppression from which we now have the opportunity to emerge."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00106.jpg] We are now entering territory where only really open minds will go. We have beenthere already, really, with the cosmic catastrophe, but if you think that isstrange and hard to believe – ‘Fasten your seat belt, Dorothy, ‘cause Kansas isgoing bye-bye’, as the chap said in The Matrix.The Earth was a scene of devastation; most of humanity was no more andeverything had to start over. The belief in what people call ‘evolution’ impliesa constant advancement of a species from ignorance to ever greater knowledge andpotential. But that is not the case in reality. Earth has been home to endlesscivilisations that have come and gone over a period (in decoded ‘time’) that isfar longer than the human history perceived by mainstream science. Americanauthor and researcher, Michael Cremo, has spent years studying the evidence forhuman existence way before the official version says human life began. He saidthat he embarked on his research after reading dozens of original scientificreports describing human bones and artefacts millions of years old that werenever included in text books. Some of these Earth civilisations have been farmore advanced than ours is today and others have been extremely primitive. Thethrottle goes both ways as they say in motorcycle racing, and so does‘evolution’. An advanced people can become primitive within minutes when theplanet is struck by the type of events that I am talking about. Look at whathappens in the aftermath of major earthquakes or disasters such as HurricaneKatrina. The ‘modern world’ is over in a flash until rescue teams arrive andrebuilding begins. What if there were no rescue workers or rebuilding becausethe same was happening all over the world? I made the point in Human Race GetOff Your Knees that it would immediately become a dog-eat-dog,everyone-for-themselves, find-your-own food, shelter and warmth free-for-allamong those who survived. Memories of today’s technological world would rapidlyfade over the thousands of years it took for the planet to recover, and itsexistence would only be preserved in stories and myths that would be dismissedas fantasy and figments of the imagination. They would laugh at the very ideathat such a world could have been here on Earth long before. They would employthe ‘if-we-can’tdo-it–it-can’t-be-done’ mentality that once scoffed at the veryidea that craft could be built to even fly never mind go into space. We arelooking at precisely such a scenario with the cataclysmic demise of the GoldenAge and the passage through history of the legends and myths that tell of itsexistence and its end. My view is that the real Golden Age of humanconsciousness expansion ended well in excess of 200,000 years ago (as we decode‘time’). This is what some Golden Age myths are really talking about, whileothers refer to what appeared to be a ‘Golden Age’ in far more recent times whencompared with the world that followed its demise amid those great geologicalevents. I will refer to the much earlier period as the Real Golden Age to makeit clear what I mean.Okay, it’s deep-breath time if this is the first book of mine that you’ve everread. Humanity had been interacting with non-human races for very a long periodbefore the catastrophe. Some were benevolent and others not so, and the lattereventually took over. There are accounts that say these ‘gods’ in some waycaused the cataclysms and this is a theme of the Great Flood stories when thegods – or in the monotheist religions, a single ‘God’ – decided to wipe outhumanity and start again. I have already mentioned the Sumerian version whichsays that the Anunna, or Anunnaki, made the decision to destroy humanity; butone of them, known as Enki, warned the priest-king Ziusudra of the coming floodand told him to get a ship sorted pretty damn quick. The Genesis version has Godsaying to Noah: ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filledwith violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and theearth’ … ‘I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life underthe heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything onearth will perish.’ Nice bloke, ‘God’. There are indications in the Sumerianstory of the Anunnaki that humanity was targeted after a rebellion against the‘gods’ and their desire to control and enslave. I suggest that the ‘gods’ werean alliance of non-human races dominated by a group taking reptilian form, butalso including some of what are known as the ant-like ‘Greys’ and some that lookvirtually human. There may well be others, too, and I will call it the‘Reptilian Alliance’ with the scaly guys very much at the forefront. It soundsfantastic, but almost everything outside the daily ‘norms’ seems to be‘fantastic’, ‘ridiculous’ and ‘not possible’ to the solidified left-brain mind.It has a perception of possibility that can only be viewed through a microscope,so, of course, it sounds hard to believe; but is it really so ‘fantastic’? Lookat the extraordinary varieties of form among animals, insects, sea-life andnature in general. Come to that, look at the variety of human forms – black,brown, white and so on; and look at the difference in appearance between someonefrom the Far East compared with the black and white races. Then remember thatthis is only what exists on one planet within the incredibly narrow band offrequencies that we can ‘see’ – visible light. What the heck must there be invarieties of form in the infinity beyond that? When you look at it from thisperspective it would be more ‘fantastic’ if intelligent life expressed throughreptilian genetics did not exist. Ancient Mesopotamian tablets say that theAnunnaki came hundreds of thousands of years ago. They brought an end to what Iam calling the Real Golden Age and turned Earth people into their slave race.The Reptilian Alliance (Anunnaki) have since then periodically caused globalcatastrophe to delete their genetic programs when they cease to be acquiescentslaves. This allows them to start again with, if necessary, an ‘upgraded’ humanbody–computer system. By upgraded, I mean more controllable. My jury is out onexactly when the Reptilians arrived, but there were certainly big and suddenchanges in human genetics 200,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago. They areplanning to do the same again now and we need to open our minds very fast towhat is happening. Some say that the Reptilians have only been here for a fewthousand years, but I think it is far, far longer although the nature of themanipulation has changed in that period. The Reptilians appear to haveconnections to the Orion and Draco constellations, but not necessarily as weperceive them, and not necessarily in the frequency range of visible light.Planets and stars are multidimensional like everything else and there aredimensions of celestial bodies, constellations and galaxies that are verydifferent to the range of frequency that we ‘see’. Saturn and the Earth’s ‘moon’are at the heart of this story and I will come to that in the next chapter.Information about the Reptilian hijack began to come into my life from justafter the mid-1990s when I began to meet people in the most synchronistic wayaround the world who told me of experiences with reptilian entities. I wasintroduced to the subject here and there in earlier years and I put it on the‘back burner’ to see where it led. I don’t just hear something and startshouting about it. This obviously sounded very weird and I needed to hear a lotmore before I would pursue this, but I didn’t dismiss it either. Informationreally started to flow over a 15-day period in 1997, as I travelled the UnitedStates going from place to place each day on a speaking tour. Well, sort of. Iwas speaking and touring, but not many were listening. But I did meet 12unconnected people over those 15 days who told me the same basic story about theexistence of a reptilian race. Several of them said they had seen people (oftenin positions of power, though not always) suddenly ‘shapeshift’ from human toreptilian form and back again. Remember that this is not a ‘physical’ shift.There is no ‘physical’. It is a waveform energetic shift, and what appears to bea ‘physical shift’ only happens in the decoding process of the observer’s mind(Fig 87). This appears as the illusion of someone changing physical shape whenthe two information fields shift and a different hologram is decoded by theobserver. I have explained in detail in other books how information about the‘Reptilians’ began to come at me from all angles after those 15 days in America.You can read this at length in books like The Biggest Secret; Children of theMatrix; Tales from the Time Loop; and the two mega-works, The David Icke Guideto the Global Conspiracy; and Human Race Get Off Your Knees. I am writing thisbook to outline the basic story for those now asking the question: ‘What’s goingon?’ But I have produced many very detailed works if you want to go deeper.image [../Images/00107.jpg] Figure 87: There is no physical shift in a shapeshift, because there is nophysical. It all happens in the observer’s mind Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) ANCIENT AND MODERN CONFIRMATIONI was contacted by Credo Mutwa, a Zulu high shaman, or ‘Sanusi’, in South Africawhen I first went public with the Reptilian story in The Biggest Secret in 1998.He gave me reams of information about the ‘Chitauri’ – the ‘Children of theSerpent’ or ‘Children of the Python’ in Zulu legend. These are what I call the‘Reptilians’. Credo was to become a great friend. He has just passed his 90thbirthday as I write this – and what an incredible man he is. Credo is an exampleto everyone with his tenacity and refusal to give up, whatever the odds (Fig88). He told me how black African secret societies had been created at the timeof the European invasion led by people like the House of Rothschild agent, CecilRhodes, who established gold and diamond mines for his masters. Rhodesia, nowZimbabwe and Zambia, was named after him. Credo said that British colonialists,like Rhodes and others, sought to destroy the ancient African knowledge andversion of human history passed down through the generations. They set out toreplace this with Christian dogma that would demonise African beliefs andhistory. This happened all over the world with the expansion of colonialism,most notably by Britain. The idea was to delete the ancient accounts, legendsand myths, and impose a fake history that would suppress what really happenedand, therefore, what is happening. Secret societies were established in Africato keep the knowledge alive, and Credo was initiated into some of them more than60 years ago. It was then that he first heard about the ‘Chitauri’, which isspelled differently in various African languages. The story he told me about theChitauri takeover of Planet Earth confirmed and supported what I had compiledfrom, by then, endless people around the world, ancient and modern sources, andIlluminati insiders that don’t agree with its agenda. (There are many peopleworking on the ‘inside’ against their will.) Compelling common themes about theReptilian race were there whatever the source.image [../Images/00108.jpg] Figure 88: The great Credo Mutwa Credo showed me an incredible ancient artefact called the Necklace of theMysteries – since stolen – that is mentioned in accounts 500 years ago, andCredo reckons it is at least another 500 years older than that (Figs 89 and 90).The ‘necklace’ rests on the shoulders and it is extremely heavy. He said it wasmade to last, because they wanted the knowledge that it symbolises to survive aslong as possible. Large symbols hang from the big copper ring, and they are usedto tell the story of African and human history since the Reptilian ‘hijack’. Asymbol of a hand is covered in other symbols, including a depiction of the Orionconstellation and a six-pointed star, or ‘Star of David’, the symbol of theHouse of Rothschild that we see on the flag of the Rothschild fiefdom, Israel,and also a symbol of Saturn. There is also an eye, symbolic of the non-human‘Watchers’, as the ancients called them. This is a theme that you find all overthe world. The eye, or all-seeing eye, is a major symbol of the Illuminatibloodlines and can be seen on the dollar bill and on the reverse of the GreatSeal of the United States which was first revealed publically in 1782 (Fig 91).This was designed by the Freemasonic cabal behind the American War ofIndependence. There is also a flying-saucer-type symbol on the necklace which issaid to be the craft that the Chitauri used to come to Earth from their‘mothership’. The more I know, the more I feel that this could have originallysymbolised Saturn for reasons that I will come to in the next chapter. Saturnhas also been symbolised as an eye. I know that the rings of Saturn were notofficially discovered until Galileo looked through his telescope in 1610, but Iam well aware after all these years that ancient knowledge, myth and legend isoften well ahead of scientific discovery. The two figures at the front of thenecklace represent a human woman and a Chitauri reptilian male; well, it’spretty obvious he’s a male, really. This symbolises the interbreeding of theChitauri with humans, which I will develop further in a second. The penis ismade of copper, but this replaced a golden one after it was stolen. This is thesame as the story at the heart of ancient Egyptian mythology about the goldenpenis of their god, Osiris. A similar version was told in Babylon and elsewhere.You find universal stories throughout the ancient world using different namesand locations. The golden penis is symbolic of what the Reptilians believe istheir ‘super seed’; and so is another prime Illuminati bloodline symbol – thelighted torch. Credo said that the Chitauri male doesn’t look reptilian, becausepeople were told not to depict them as they really looked. Many of their imagesare largely symbolic for this reason. They are depicted as clearly not human,but not as they really are, although you do still find literal, or at leastreptilian, representations in many cultures (Fig 92[../Text/index_split_020.html#filepos307759]). Credo painted a picture of onespecies of Reptilian/Chitauri (there are many) from ancient and modern accounts,which you can see in Figure 93 [../Text/index_split_021.html#filepos308245]. Thepicture alongside that looks remarkably similar was painted much more recentlyby Robert Llimos, a Spanish artist who I met when I spoke at an event inBarcelona, Spain, in 2010 (Fig 94 [../Text/index_split_021.html#filepos308287]).Robert’s girlfriend is Brazilian and on a trip there in 2009 he went out aloneinto the countryside to paint the landscape. He was not interested in any ofthis information before then and wasn’t even aware of my existence, let alonewhat I was saying. But his experience was to change all that. As he stood withhis brush and easel, painting away in the countryside, he said that aspacecraft, some 50 metres wide, descended in front him and stayed for two hours(Fig 95 [../Text/index_split_021.html#filepos309201]). Robert told me that hedoesn’t know if he was taken on board the craft, but he has no memory of that.He painted what he was seeing while two reptilian figures stared at him from theonly window that was open. The left-brain media (of course) and much of thepublic thought that it was hilarious when I started talking and writing aboutthe Reptilian manipulation of human society; but I didn’t, and don’t, give adamn. They are just water to my duck’s arse. People can scoff and laugh as muchas they like. These entities exist and they are fundamentally impacting uponhuman life.

SheilaCoulson, an archaeologist from the University of Oslo, in Norway, has documentedevidence of python worship 70,000 years ago in the Tsodilo Hills of the KalahariDesert in South Africa. This is home to the world’s biggest known concentrationof rock paintings. The mythology of the ancient San people, also known as‘Bushmen’, says that the Tsodilo Hills are where humans were created when thegiant python went there with a ‘bag of eggs’. Zulu shaman, Credo Mutwa, told methat ‘Africa’ comes from the ancient word, ‘Wafirika’. This means ‘the firstpeople on Earth’, or ‘the first people here’. The word ‘Zulu’ itself means‘people from the stars’. They say they were seeded by a race that came frombeyond the Earth. Rebecca Cann, Assistant Professor of Genetics at theUniversity of Hawaii, co-authored a study in 1987 in the journal, Nature,suggesting that all modern humans are descended from a single mother who livedin Africa in about 200,000 BC. She said the connection was through themitochondrial DNA, which passes down through the female. Human brain capacityapparently expanded at an increasingly rapid rate over millions of years, butthis expansion suddenly stopped and went into reverse about 200,000 years ago.Mesopotamian accounts about the Anunnaki say that humans rebelled more than200,000 years ago and they decided to produce a ‘new human’ that could be moreeasily controlled. A man called Reverend John Bathurst Deane published a studyin the 1930s about the history of serpent worship all over the world. He tracedits origins to Sumer and Babylon, now Iraq, a very significant land in the storyI am telling. It’s also known as Mesopotamia. Reverend Deane charted theexpansion of serpent worship out of this region and into Egypt; Persia; AsiaMinor (now Turkey); Phoenicia; Arabia and the Middle East; India and Asia;China; Japan; Ethiopia and the rest of Africa; Mexico; Great Britain;Scandinavia; Italy; Greece; Crete; Rhodes; Cyprus; Sri Lanka; Northern andWestern Europe; and North, South and Central America. Well, virtuallyeverywhere, in fact. The Mayan people, in what is now Mexico, say theirancestors were ‘the people of the serpent’. They talked about a reptilian racethat came from the sky to take over their civilisation and demand humansacrifice. The latter is a common theme. The reptilian race and their othernon-human associates were perceived as ‘gods’ because of their technologicalcapabilities. The Hopi tribe in the United States talk of their ‘snakebrothers’, the ‘sky gods’, who bred with their women. Indian accounts tell of areptilian race called the ‘Sharpa’ that founded civilisation and were theoriginators of the shockingly racist Hindu caste system. This is a version ofthe strictly-imposed Reptilian genetic hierarchy. These guys are obsessed withgenetics and hierarchy. The Illuminati bloodlines’ genetic hierarchy originatesfrom the same source. Indian accounts of the reptilian race also say that theydemanded human sacrifice. Chinese mythology says that a ‘Serpent Queen’interbred with men. The existence of a reptilian race, the demand for humansacrifice and the interbreeding with humans are universal themes. John BathurstDeane produced the book The Worship of the Serpent (BibioBazaar; 2009, firstpublished 1933) in which he says that ‘the mystic serpent entered into themythology of every nation; consecrated almost every temple; symbolized almostevery deity; was imagined in the heavens, stamped upon the earth, and ruled inthe realms of everlasting sorrow’. He said the serpent was the main symbol ofmythology and the ‘only common object of superstitious terror throughout thehabitable world’. This was the book’s conclusion: > It appears, then, that no nations were so geographically remote, or so> religiously discordant, but that one – and only one – superstitious> characteristic was common to all: that the most civilized and the most> barbarous bowed down with the same devotion to the same engrossing deity; and> that this deity either was, or was represented by, the same sacred serpent. It> appears also that in most, if not all, of the civilized countries where this> serpent was worshipped, some fable or tradition which involved his history,> directly or indirectly, alluded to the Fall of Man in Paradise, in which the> serpent was concerned. What follows, then, but that the most ancient account> respecting the cause and nature of this seduction must be the one from which> all the rest are derived which represent the victorious serpent – victorious> over man in a state of innocence, and subduing his soul in a state of sin,> into the most abject veneration and adoration of himself. Now some of this will have originated from serpent-like plasma discharges in thesky, which electrical-universe researchers say would have been produced duringthe cataclysmic events in the heavens. This is especially true with the mythsabout ‘fire-breathing dragons’. But the correlation between global serpentworship and the ancient and modern confirmation of the existence of reptilianentities, or ‘gods’, is far too obvious and compelling to say that the universalworship of the serpent comes only from plasma images in the ancient skies.Anyway, documented serpent worship goes back many tens of thousands of yearsbefore the proposed time of the ‘Saturn catastrophe’ described in the lastchapter. The challenge is to identify which are memories of the ‘serpentplasma’, and which symbolise the Reptilian ‘gods’. The other thing we need toremember across the whole swathe of symbolism is that what the symbols mean topeople can change over the countless generations. A goddess that began as asymbol for Venus, for example, can later be used to symbolise the Moon. A longlist of symbols, buildings and imagery went through this metamorphosis whenPagan Rome embraced the closet Pagan religion of Christianity.THE GREAT SWITCH-OFFHumanity has been through a genetic metamorphosis as the Reptilian Alliancetampered with human genetics, deleted programs with Earth catastrophes andintroduced new ones. Other racial groups within this alliance were also involvedto some extent and this is one reason for different races on Earth. TheReptilian interlopers are master geneticists and they have designed the humanmind/body–computer specifically for the purpose of enslavement. This geneticmanipulation has had two major effects: (1) It drastically reduced the range offrequencies that humans could access and decode, leaving us with a tiny range ofperception that we call ‘visible light’; (2) The mind/body–computer was tunedinto a false reality – the ‘Matrix’ – and I will explain how this is done later.(Strap in for that one!) The illusory reality portrayed in The Matrix movieseries was very accurate with regard to how humans are ‘plugged in’ toexperience a ‘world’ that isn’t what it appears to be. Genetic manipulationexplains part of the reason why scientists refer to between 90 and 97 per centof human DNA as ‘junk’ DNA, because it does not seem to serve any purpose. Infact, a lot of this ‘junk’ DNA potential has been ‘switched off’ and other partsare interacting with other realities and programs. I read that the idea that weuse less than 10 per cent of the brain is an urban legend, but they are talkingabout areas of the brain. If they knew the brain’s true potential compared withwhat humans currently use they would realise that we are operating with afraction of the brain’s capacity. This is another consequence of geneticmanipulation. There is clear evidence of gene splicing in the human body, aprocess that geneticists use today. Gene splicing is like cutting frames from afilm and putting them back in at another place; or taking frames from two moviesand editing them together to create a hybrid of the two. Lloyd Pye, an Americanresearcher and writer, has made a detailed study of human origins. He says thathuman DNA has more than 4,000 defects, while only a few hundred are found inchimpanzees and gorillas. Pye says there is ‘evidence of gene segments that havebeen cut, flipped and reinserted upside down back into the genome’, andchromosomes in humans have also been fused together (a process seen only inlaboratories) to leave us with apparently two fewer than chimpanzees andgorillas. Even mainstream science has noted there were sudden changes in humangenetics around 200,000 years ago, and again about 35,000 years ago. TheCanadian reported that researchers involved with the Human Genome Project saythey believe that the more than 90 per cent of non-coding DNA – ‘junk’ DNA – isthe genetic code of extraterrestrial life forms. I think some of it definitelyis and it is designed to attach us to their collective mind, as I will beexplaining. Other sections of ‘junk’ DNA have simply been switched off toprevent them from connecting us to a far greater scale of decoded reality. TheCanadian reported how the group’s leader, a ‘Professor Sam Chang’, says that theoverwhelming majority of human DNA is of ‘off-world’ origin and the‘extraterrestrial junk genes’ merely ‘enjoy the ride’ with hardworking activegenes passed through the generations. Professor Chang worked with otherscientists, computer programmers, mathematicians and scholars, to consider if‘junk’ DNA was created by some kind of ‘extraterrestrial programmer’. It was,and this will be massively important later in the book when I come to howtechnology is manipulating the perceptions of the human population. The Canadianquoted Professor Sam Chang as saying that the ‘alien’ parts of ‘junk’ DNAproduce ‘their own veins, arteries and immune system that vigorously resists allour anti-cancer drugs’. > Our hypothesis is that a higher extraterrestrial life form was engaged in> creating new life and planting it on various planets. Earth is just one of> them. Perhaps, after programming, our creators grow us the same way we grow> bacteria in Petri dishes. We can’t know their motives – whether it was a> scientific experiment, or a way of preparing new planets for colonization, or> the long-time ongoing business of seeding life in the universe. Professor Chang is reported to have said that perhaps the ‘extraterrestrialprogrammers’ were working with ‘one big code’ creating life-forms on manyplanets. He is said to speculate that perhaps they wrote ‘one big code, executedit, did not like some function, changed it or added a new one, executed itagain, made more improvements, tried again and again’. Ancient accounts of theAnunnaki/Chitauri say that there were many attempts to genetically-engineer a‘new human’ before they succeeded. The Canadian quotes Professor Chang assaying: > What we see in our DNA is a program consisting of two versions, a big code and> basic code. First fact is, the complete ‘program’ was positively not written> on Earth; that is now a verified fact. The second fact is that genes, by> themselves, are not enough to explain evolution; there must be something more> in ‘the game’ … Sooner or later we have to come to grips with the unbelievable> notion that every life on Earth carries genetic code for his extraterrestrial> cousin, and that evolution is not what we think it is. The genetic manipulation meant that the vast perception range of humans in theReal Golden Age was now gone, and a series of genetic ‘upgrades’ (slavegrades)have confined humanity to this sliver of ‘reality’ – visible light. TheReptilian Alliance wanted to create a human genetic form that was intelligentenough to serve them as a slave race, but too stupid to realise that it wasbeing controlled, how it was being controlled, and by whom. It also involved amassive infusion of reptilian genetics to connect humans vibrationally to themand their ‘Matrix’. Accounts and legends of the interbreeding between humans andnon-human entities, ‘the gods’, can be found right across the ancient world – aswith the ‘Chitauri’ in South Africa. It is most famously recorded in Genesis6:4, which says: ‘There were giants in the earth in those days; and also afterthat, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they barechildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.’These were the biblical ‘Nefilim’. The phrase ‘sons of God’ is a translationfrom text that refers to gods plural, sons of the gods, not a single ‘God’.Genesis also says: > And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; … So God> created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and> female created he them [humans were androgynous in the Real Golden Age] –> Genesis 1:26-27 > And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good> and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of> life, and eat, and live for ever – Genesis 3:22 Note again that it says ‘our image’, ‘our likeness’, and ‘one of us’, plural.The Reptilians did create humans in their genetic image in that they infused thehuman body–computer with their own reptilian information and coding. So we didto a large extent ‘become’ one of them, and knew (decoded) good and ‘evil’.There was no ‘evil’ (the reverse of ‘live’) in the Real Golden Age before theReptilian intervention.‘THE FALL’This is the universal story of the ‘Fall of Man’ that is told in differentversions across the world, and again the best known version is the symbolicbiblical story of the Garden of Eden. Who does it say was the villain thatmanipulated Adam and Eve with the ‘apple’ and had them thrown out of the‘garden’? The serpent. The ‘garden’ was the Real Golden Age and the range ofperception that humanity then experienced. The term ‘apple’ is sometimes used bythe Illuminati bloodlines to symbolise their control of a global structure ofhuman enslavement that serves the agenda of the hidden Reptilian masters. Itmight be that there was interbreeding through procreation between humans and theReptilians, but it certainly didn’t have to be that way. We know today that itis possible to produce children through ‘test tube’ methods, and we also havegene splicing, but there is a stage even beyond that for those who understandthe nature of reality. DNA is a receiver–transmitter and it can be altered bybroadcasting information on its frequency to change the genetic structure.Remember the Russian research group that successfully transmitted informationpatterns from one DNA to another and changed frog embryos to salamander embryosby transmitting salamander DNA information patterns. The genetic manipulationtuned humanity into the Reptilian collective, or ‘hive’ mind, through theartificial reality ‘Matrix’ that I will be describing. Long after I had beenwriting and talking about this information I came across the works of thePeruvian-born writer, Carlos Castaneda, who wrote a series of books from thelate 1960s. He said his source was Don Juan Matus, a Yaqui Indian healer, orshaman – a ‘Credo Mutwa’ of Mexico, a carrier of the ancient knowledge inCentral America. Some have questioned Don Juan’s literal existence, but thewords he is quoted as saying had me going, ‘Wow!’ when I read them, given what Ihad already put together. Part of the synchronistic sequence of information thatI am guided to compile is often to get a re-confirmation ‘out of the blue’ afterI have made something public. It is like, ‘See, you are on the right track.’This is what Don Juan Matus said: > We have a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos and took over the> rule of our lives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lord> and master. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it> suppresses our protest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we> don’t do so … indeed we are held prisoner! > They took us over because we are food to them, and they squeeze us mercilessly> because we are their sustenance. Just as we rear chickens in coops, the> predators rear us in human coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always> available to them. > Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictions> between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems> of belief, or the stupidity of his contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe> that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs, our ideas of good and> evil; our social mores. They are the ones who set up our dreams of success or> failure. They have given us covetousness, greed and cowardice. It is the> predator who makes us complacent, routinary and egomaniacal. > In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged> themselves in a stupendous manoeuvre – stupendous, of course, from the point> of view of a fighting strategist; a horrendous manoeuvre from the point of> those who suffer it. They gave us their mind. The predators’ mind is baroque,> contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any minute> now. The ‘predator’ is the Reptilian Alliance and they have given us their mind.ENERGY VAMPIRESThe ‘food’ that Don Juan talks about there is low-vibrational human emotionalenergy that resonates in the frequency band generated by states of fear, hatred,stress, depression, worry and suchlike. Ever wondered why there is so much ofthis generated 24/7 by human society? Or why the actions of those in power areconstantly generating more with their wars, terrorism and financial crasheswhich stimulate fear, death, horror, sadness and hardship the world over? Or whythe Illuminati-controlled mainstream media and computer games are full of imagesthat trigger those same emotions? The goal is to manipulate humanity into mentaland emotional states that produce the low-vibrational energy on which theReptilian energetic vampires feed and glean their power from. Morpheus held up abattery in The Matrix and said that the ‘machines’ had turned humans into ‘oneof these’. If you replace ‘machines’ with Reptilian Alliance you pretty muchhave it. They know that if they can manipulate us into these emotional states wewill generate the energy they need. You can now see why there is such a focus onmanipulating people through fear, stress, anger and resentment into incoherentheart patterns that will disharmonise the entire decoding process and causemayhem emotionally, mentally and physically. All of this produces lowvibrationalenergy. People don’t think clearly when they are in an imbalanced emotionalstate. You only have to experience being in a large group of people such as afootball crowd to appreciate the power of electromagnetic energy produced bythat collective emotion – ‘the hairs on the back of my neck stood up’. Differentmental and emotional states generate different frequencies, and this can be seenin the work of Japanese writer and researcher, Dr Masaru Emoto. He is well knownfor his experiments involving the vibrational impact on water. I spent a weekendin London with him a few years ago and visited his centre in Tokyo where he doeshis work. He has written a number of books, and we produced one together inJapanese. Dr Emoto attaches words, statements or technology to canisters ofwater. He then freezes the water very quickly and photographs the watercrystals. The difference in the structure of the crystals in response to thestatements or technology is incredible, as you can see in Figure 96. Dr Emoto’sfindings are supported by the experiments at the German Aerospace Institute thatI outlined earlier. If you saw the effect that a mobile phone has you wouldnever make another call. The crystal on the left was formed by words of love andappreciation, while the other was the result of: ‘You make me sick – I want tokill you’. Everything in this reality is a vibrational field madeholographically manifest, and this includes the written word. We see wordswritten at the holographic level as ‘love’ or ‘hate’, but in their base formthey are vibrational information. This vibration resonates through the water andits effect can then be captured by photographing the crystals. This book is nowcommunicating with you on a vibrational level even more profoundly thaneye-to-mind. The ‘You may me sick – I want to kill you’-type energy is what theReptilians need humans to generate. They are themselves in such a lowvibrationalstate that they can only absorb what they can synchronise with. Wars, disasterslike the Japanese tsunami and catastrophic radiation leak, terrorist attackssuch as a 9/11, an economic crash, and angry, hostile public protests, allproduce stupendous amounts of the very emotional energy on which the Reptiliansfeed and recycle back to us in a feedback loop. This is a major reason why theReptilian Control System in ‘human’ form – the Illuminati bloodlines – ensuresthat events like these continually unfold.image [../Images/00116.jpg] Figure 96: The water crystal on the left was created by words of love andappreciation, and the other came from: ‘You make me sick – I want to kill you’ There are Reptilian entities living inside the Earth that operate within visiblelight, as do the Greys, and there are many Reptilian bases underground wherethey interact with ‘human’ scientists to introduce enslaving and controllingtechnology on the surface and continue their genetic experimentation. Thecutting edge of ‘science’ is not even close to what you see in the publicdomain. There are also bases on other frequency dimensions of the Earth, becausethe centre of the Reptilian power structure operates from frequencies beyondvisible light. In other words, we can’t see them. They can come in and out ofvisible light using technology, and by energetic means, but they generallyoperate outside of human sight. I am sure that humans could see them when we hadaccess to a much greater range of visual frequency, but since the geneticintervention we can’t see them unless they enter our frequency range, which theydo here and there. This is one aspect of the ‘shape-shifting’ phenomenon as aReptilian energy field replaces a human one and an observer thinks they areseeing a physical transformation. Humans eat ‘physical’ food, or think they do,but it is holographic food which is only decoded vibrational information.’Good’food is vibrational information that synchronises with the human bodyenergy-field, and ‘bad’ food distorts it. Illuminati corporations fill thestores with chemically-infested, irradiated bad ‘food’ for this reason. Animbalanced energy field produces imbalanced thought and emotion (their foodsource) and stops people getting ‘out there’ to the greater reality that wouldset them free and allow them to understand their plight. Reptilians beyondvisible light feed directly off vibrational fields, and when we express mentaland emotional states we produce energy resonating ‘good vibes’ or ‘bad vibes’.Reptilians want the ‘bad vibes’, and humanity must continually be exploited toproduce them, or their food source is no more. Humanity in a state of love andharmony is the Reptilians’ worst nightmare. Explains a lot, eh? Carlos Castanedaquotes shaman Don Juan Matus as saying: > I know that even now, though you never have suffered hunger … you have food> anxiety, which is none other than the anxiety of the predator who fears that> at any moment now its manoeuvre is going to be uncovered and food is going to> be denied. Through the mind, which, after all is their mind, the predators> inject into the lives of human beings whatever is convenient for them. And> they ensure, in this manner, a degree of security to act as a buffer against> their fear. > Sorcerers of ancient Mexico … reasoned that man must have been a complete> being at one point, with stupendous insights, feats of awareness that are> mythological legends nowadays. And then, everything seems to disappear, and we> have now a sedated man. What I’m saying is that what we have against us is not> a simple predator. It is very smart, and organised. It follows a methodical> system to render us useless. Man, the magical being that he is destined to be,> is no longer magical. He’s an average piece of meat. There are no more dreams> for man but the dreams of an animal that is being raised to be a piece of> meat: trite, conventional, imbecilic. He is describing the difference between humans of the Real Golden Age, when wehad massively expanded awareness, and humans after the Reptilians moved in andchanged the way we receive and transmit information. The portrayal of the worldof the Blue People, or Na’vi, in the movie, Avatar, was very much like the Earthin the Real Golden Age, and there are two other aspects of that James Cameronfilm which portray what has happened to humanity. Firstly, you had theleft-brain technologists and military goons with no empathy, respect or evenunderstanding of the Blue People’s idyllic world in which everything was ‘One’.There was communication and respect between the Blue People, animals, trees andthe natural world in general. All the left-brain goons knew was that there wereresources under the Blue People’s world that were very valuable if mined andtaken back to Earth. The Reptilians are of the same mentality as the humanmilitary portrayed in Avatar, only even more extreme. They have been plunderingthe Earth for resources, not least gold, since they arrived. We are going tofind that most of the gold reserves, including those in America’s Fort Knox, arenot actually there. They have long gone to the Reptilian Alliance. There havebeen a number of stories circulating that gold bars across the world have gonemissing and been replaced by tungsten bars with a gold coating. Some reportshave even appeared in the mainstream media. Tungsten is the same density as goldto three decimal places. Pakistan Daily, an online news agency, reported thatwhen Bill Clinton was US President ‘… between 1.3 and 1.5 million 400oz tungstenblanks were allegedly manufactured by a very high-end, sophisticated refiner inthe USA’. They totalled more than 16 thousand metric tonnes. The report saidthat 640,000 of these tungsten blanks were gold plated and shipped to the US‘gold’ depository at Fort Knox. It said that the Chinese received a shipment ofmore than 5,600 gold bars in October 2009 for payment of debts. Tests toguarantee their purity and weight revealed the bars to be fake. The serialnumbers confirmed that they originated in America’s Fort Knox. Congressman RonPaul is one of the few politicians on Capitol Hill prepared to challenge thesystem, and he has been pressing unsuccessfully for a ‘purity audit’ of the‘gold’ in Fort Knox to prove its authenticity. CNBC requested a tour of FortKnox to film the gold and update the last footage that was taken in 1974. Anofficial declined the request. He said that Fort Knox is a ‘closed facility’ andhe was not aware of any member of Congress touring the facility since 1974. TheHouse of Rothschild, who are earthly representatives of the Reptilian Alliance,have dominated the world gold market, and the price of gold was set every day atthe offices of N M Rothschild in London from 1919 until 2004. Then, suddenly,the Rothschilds withdrew from the gold market. The Reptilians are very advanced‘intellectually’ and experts in fields like technology and genetics. But theyare spiritually dead, and they have been leading humanity in the same direction.This made the spiritually dead human soldiers depicted in the Avatar movie theperfect symbols of the Reptilian mentality. Another point worthy of mention isthe word ‘Avatar’ itself. The filmmakers say: ‘An avatar is a human mindtransferred into a genetically-engineered body of a human/Na’vi hybrid.’ Thiswas done in the story so that the human military could infiltrate the Na’visociety without being seen, because they looked like the Na’vi. Avatar wasreleased in 2009, and it portrays in theme what I have been describing since1998 – human society has been infiltrated by a non-human controlling force, apredator that hides behind human formILLUMINATI BLOODLINESAll humans have very significant reptilian genetics, especially the reptilianbrain, or ‘R-complex’, as scientists call it. A substance called ‘Pheromone’ issecreted and released by animals to detect members of the same species, and thepheromones in human women and iguanas are a chemical match. Carl Sagan, thegreat American cosmologist, wrote a book called The Dragons of Eden describingthe impact of reptilian genetics on human behaviour. He said that it was unwiseto ignore the reptilian component of human nature, particularly our ritualisticand hierarchical behaviour. ‘On the contrary,’ he said,’the model may help usunderstand what human beings are really about.’ Sagan knew far more than he eversaid about what was going on, because of the way the sciences are policed. Hewas bang on with the impact on human behaviour of reptilian genetics. Thereptilian brain is a prime influence on human society and behaviour (Fig 97).Researcher, Skip Largent, highlighted this in an Internet article about the‘R-complex’:image [../Images/00117.jpg] Figure 97: The reptilian brain, or R-complex, is a fundamental influence ofhuman behaviour and perception > At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain. Without> defining them, I shall simply say that in human activities they find> expression in: obsessive compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals and> superstitious acts; slavish conformance to old ways of doing things;> ceremonial re-enactments; obeisance to precedent, as in legal, religious,> cultural, and other matters and all manner of deceptions. Anyone recognise that in the world that we experience every day? Those traitsare the very lifeblood of world religions, secret societies and royal protocoland ritual, and these organisations and royal bloodlines are all the creationsof the Reptilian conspiracy. I say that humans didn’t have a reptilian brain, orit was nothing like as significant, before the Reptilian genetic intervention.I’ll talk more about this and how we are locked into the ‘Matrix’ in partthrough the reptilian brain in the next chapter; but for now I’ll just say thateven mainstream science admits that the reptilian brain gives us charactertraits like aggression; cold-bloodedness (no empathy) and ritualistic behaviour;a desire for control, power and ownership – ‘territoriality’; might is right;domination over others and submission to others (which one depends on yourpersonality type); compulsions and obsessions; worship; rigidity; and a desirefor social hierarchies. Does that describe human society, or what? Yes, becauseit is a Reptilian-created and controlled society. Humans have other parts of thebrain (and crucially the heart) that can balance out the traits of the reptilianbrain; but, of course, any group that has a greater infusion of reptiliangenetics is going to express those traits in a far more extreme way. Enter theIlluminati bloodlines. The Reptilians genetically-engineered particularbloodlines that were specially designed to allow them to manipulate and controlthe human world of visible light while looking as human as everybody else.Reptilians operating outside of visible light basically ‘wear’ these genetichybrid holographic computers to infiltrate human society in precisely the sameway as portrayed in the movie Avatar. The far greater genetic compatibilitymeans there is a far greater vibrational and frequency compatibility. Thisallows these human-reptilian hybrids of the Illuminati families to be‘possessed’, and their mental and emotional processes (actions) controlled fromanother reality (Fig 98). This is the true nature of the Illuminati familiesthat today sit atop the pyramids of global politics, banking, transnationalcorporations, media, Big Pharma, Big Biotech, Big Oil, Big Food, and all therest. There are 13 bloodlines at the top of the hybrid’s hierarchical pyramidand the British royal family is among them, as are the Rothschilds and theRockefellers.image [../Images/00118.jpg] Figure 98: Genetic compatibility means vibrational compatibility and thereforeextremely powerful ‘possession’ Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) Their hybrid DNA has dual codes – human and reptilian. While the human codes areactivated and open, a human form is projected holographically, but when theyshift (shapeshift) and open their reptilian codes, a reptilian form isprojected. They carefully plan their interbreeding so the reptilian codes don’tbecome so dominant that they will take reptilian form when they don’t intend to.One way that they keep the human codes open is to drink copious amounts ofmammalian blood that carries and stimulates human genetic coding. This is onereason for their obsession with human sacrifice rituals and blood drinking. TheReptilians most preferred breeding partners are blond-haired, blue-eyed peopleand also those with red hair and blue eyes. All that stuff in Nazi Germany withthe Aryan ‘master race’ was really about producing blond-haired, blue-eyedpeople for Reptilian interbreeding. American author, Stewart Swerdlow, hasdirect experience of the story that I am describing here. Stewart was imprisonedfor many years in an Illuminati mind-control and genetics programme at Montaukon Long Island, New York. He was taken at night by what he thought wereextraterrestrials but, in fact, were American government and military operativesat Montauk. A common way that they confuse their targets is to make them thinkthey have had an extraterrestrial ‘encounter’, when the people involved arehuman. This happened to Stewart, shockingly with the permission of his mother.Stewart says that he learned about the agenda for global domination and thereptilian entities behind it all during his time at Montauk. He said that he hadseen reptilian humanoids at Montauk and they ‘seemed to pop in and out ofphysical reality’. Even the Reptilians are not the bottom of the rabbit hole;they are only another level of it. Stewart Swerdlow says that the Reptilianswere created by the ‘transparent people’. These entities ‘cannot really enterinto the physical dimensions because their energy vibratory rate is so high thatit cannot sustain a physical body’. When they do appear, he says, ‘it looks likea transparent glass shell’. Stewart learned that Reptilian geneticists wanted a50–50 mix of genetics to produce a body that looked human while being able toshapeshift into reptilian form: ‘Shapeshifting was accomplished simply byconcentrating on the genetics the hybrid wished to open, or lock up, whateverthe case may be.’ He says that the term ‘blue bloods’ for royal and aristocraticfamilies comes from the fact that the blood of the hybrids contains more copperand it turns blue-green during a process called oxidation."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00119.jpg] Figure 99: The ‘human’ energy field of the bloodline hybrids is the one that theobserver normally decodes, but overshadowing the human is a reptilian field andwhen that becomes dominant the observer decodes (‘sees’) a ‘shift’ from one tothe other. These two forms are actually encoded in the hybrid DNA and when thecodes change, so does the outer form Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) We are only decoding the five-sense visible-light band of frequency, and when wesee these hybrids they appear to be human like the rest of us. But if we couldsee further into the frequency field, or if their reptilian codes kicked in, wewould see something very different (Fig 99). Remember those traits of reptiliangenetics: aggression; cold-blooded (no empathy) and ritualistic behaviour; adesire for control, power and ownership – ‘territoriality’; might is right;domination; compulsions and obsessions; worship; rigidity; and a desire forsocial hierarchies. The Illuminati bloodlines express these traits to a far moreextreme degree than the human population with their far more extreme levels ofreptilian genetics. The cold-blooded (no empathy) trait, is one that I have beenhighlighting for a long time. The hybrid bloodlines have empathy deleted fromtheir genetic personality (decoding system), and empathy is the fail-safemechanism of behaviour. You don’t express extreme behaviour that kills, hurts ordamages other people if you have empathy with how they will feel as aconsequence of your actions. But there are no limits to what you will do whenyou can’t feel empathy, and that’s the situation with the Illuminati Reptilianhybrids. Pepper-bomb cities full of civilians? No problem. Mass poison the humanpopulation through additives in food and water, radiation, microwaves and thelike? What fun. Kill 3,000 people on 9/11, and millions more since, justified by9/11 and the need to ‘fight terrorism’? How we laughed. I have been saying forso long that people are never going to understand what is happening in the worldif they judge what these bloodlines would do on the basis of what theythemselves would do. The Reptilian hybrids are not the same as you and me in theway they see life and reality. They are the means through which the ReptilianAlliance can invade human society without being seen for what they really are.When scientists are working with material that is too dangerous to handle theywill have it placed in a sealed tank while they stand outside and donarms-length sealed gloves to work inside the tank. Imagine the scientist to be aReptilian entity, the tank to be the human visible-light frequency range and thegloves to be the hybrid bloodlines, and you get the picture of the role theIlluminati families play in all of this (Fig 100). The Reptilians are very closeto our reality – what Stewart Swerdlow calls ‘borderline physical’ – but theymostly don’t appear in our reality or it would obviously give their game away.They also have a problem with Earth’s current atmosphere and this is why theyare working to change it to make it more suitable for them. I’ll talk about thislater.REPTILIAN PYRAMID BUILDERSReptilian hybrids were seeded and planted all over the ancient world and, inleague with their Reptilian owners, they established the first ‘civilisations’after the Earth recovered from the last global cataclysm. These civilisationsappeared in places like Sumer, which became Babylon and is now Iraq; Egypt; theIndus Valley; Mesoamerica (including the Mayans); the Andes in South America(the Incas); and China (Fig 101). But the Reptilian connection to Africa goesback much further, as I will explain in a moment. Here you have the reason whythese civilisations were far more advanced than the rest of the world. TheReptilian Alliance was the source of the knowledge that allowed amazing ancientstructures to be built by ‘primitive people’ with stones weighing hundreds oftonnes. We would struggle to build some of them even today. But this is quitestraightforward when you know you are not dealing with something ‘physical’, buta holographic projection from an information field. The Reptilians were thepyramid builders all over the world and not just in Egypt. They are found inCentral America, Mesopotamia, China, all over (Fig 102). There are endlesspyramids under the ground across the world that have yet to be discovered. Vastpyramids have been found in Bosnia in Europe that were believed to be juststrange looking hills covered in soil, grass and trees; but excavations revealedthat underneath were ancient pyramids, and one called the ‘Pyramid of the Moon’has been carbon-dated to be at least 10,000 years old. I think the pyramids werebuilt as part of a network that connects the waveform dimension of the Earth tothe Reptilian ‘Matrix’, or false reality, that we are decoding and believing tobe real. The Mayans of Mexico told of a reptilian race, the ‘Iguana Men’, whocame from the sky and taught them the art of pyramid building. The ReptilianAlliance was the knowledge source for the incredible structures made frommassive chunks of stone in the Inca lands of Peru. Stones of 400 tonnes havebeen put together so perfectly that you can’t put a sheet of paper between them(Fig 103). The Reptilian Alliance was the ‘brains’ behind the ancient Nazcalines in Peru – the incredible depictions of birds, insects and animals usingone continuous line. They are so big that they can only be seen in theirentirety from an aircraft (Fig 104). The stone statues on Easter Island in thePacific are another example.image [../Images/00120.jpg] Figure 100: Neil Hague’s symbolic image of the ‘scientist’ (Reptilian) outsidethe ‘tank’ (visible-light reality) manipulating inside the tank through the‘gloves’ (the hybrid bloodlines) Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00121.jpg] Figure 101: Some of the Reptilian-inspired civilisations after the lastcataclysm; but the Reptilian connection to Africa goes back much further image [../Images/00122.jpg] Figure 102: The Reptilians were the pyramid builders. image [../Images/00123.jpg] Figure 103: ‘Primitive’ humans did this? image [../Images/00124.jpg] Figure 104: One of the amazing images in the Nazca Desert in Peru. The hybrid bloodlines implanted into the lands of Sumer and Babylon, orMesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, are highlysignificant in relation to the Illuminati families in the positions of power inboth public and behind the scenes today. So, too, is ancient Egypt. But thereare others that have been ‘incubating’ for centuries in the Far East, especiallyChina, waiting to become a global influence. This is also the case with India toan extent. I have been saying since the 1990s that we should watch for theeconomic and military emergence of China. This is a blueprint society for theworld that the Reptilian Alliance and its hybrids want to impose upon all of us.Sumer (roughly 5,000 BC to 2000 BC) was preceded by the Ubaid culture, fromwhich came those reptilian mother-and-baby figurines. Sumer was followed inthese same lands by Babylon. Other civilisations in the same area include theAssyrian and Chaldean, and today this land is called Iraq. This region is ofgreat significance to the Reptilian hybrids and not only for oil as most peoplebelieve. Many of today’s Illuminati bloodlines came from this area thousands ofyears ago. It is not a surprise, therefore, to find that the ancient claytablets found buried in Iraq since the 19th century tell of a reptilian racecalled the Anunnaki that came to Earth to exploit humans as a slave race miningfor gold and other resources in what is now Africa. Evidence has been found ofgold mining in Africa at least 100,000 years ago. The tablets say the Anunnakialso embarked in Africa on a programme of genetic manipulation. Africa is hometo the Tsodilo Hills, where the San people say that humans (as we know them)were created by the ‘Great Python’ with his symbolic bag of eggs, and whereserpent worship goes back at least 70,000 years. The tablets say that theAnunnaki (‘Those Who From Heaven To Earth Came’) were led by their king, Anu,but the operation on Earth was overseen by two brothers, Enlil and Enki. Thismatches Zulu accounts of the Reptilian Chitauri which tell of two brothers,Wowane and Mpanku. The tablets say that Enki, the chief scientist andgeneticist, and a female, who the tablets call Ninkharsag, an expert inmedicine, led the human genetic programme which, after many failures, producedthe genetic form we know today. The tablets describe, as I said earlier, howZiusudra, the Sumerian version of the biblical ‘Noah’, long before the biblicaltexts were written, was told by Enki that the Anunnaki were going to cause greatcataclysms on Earth and he should build a large ‘boat’. The themes of Genesisare a re-written version of Sumerian stories from thousands of years earlierwith the reptilian Anunnaki morphing into a single biblical ‘God’ (with the oddplural still surviving here and there). Credo Mutwa has spent his long lifetimestudying ancient African legend and lore and he says that all the Sumerian andEgyptian gods can be found in southern Africa long before they appeared in NorthAfrica and the Middle East. This supports the Sumerian contention that theAnunnaki first located in Africa.SERPENT MONARCHYThe hybrid bloodlines, which are far more reptilian than the general population,were genetically-engineered both to represent Reptilian Alliance interestswithin visible light and to hide the identity of the real controllers. These‘elite’ bloodlines became known as ‘demigods’ – part human–part god – and theybecame the ‘royal families’ of the ancient world who became the royal,aristocratic and Illuminati families of today. The ‘blue bloods’ have alwaysobsessively interbred, and they still do. Genetics to the Reptilians is asoftware program and they need to keep it intact or the information in thehybrid software will be diluted, eventually deleted, through breeding withnon-hybrids. The bloodline families often tend to choose the partners for theiroffspring for this reason, and many marry for genetic necessity rather thanattraction. The Reptilian obsession with genetics can be seen in the obsessionmany of them have with breeding horses and why horse racing is referred to as‘the sport of kings’. The ancient clay tablets found in Iraq (Sumer/Babylon)said that ‘kingship’ was introduced by the Anunnaki (via their hybrids), and sono wonder that Sargon the Great, ruler of the Sumer/Akkadian Empire, claimedthat he descended from the gods. This hybrid genetics is the origin of the themeof the ‘divine right to rule’ – the right to rule because of your ‘god’genetics. Chinese emperors claimed the right to be ruler because of theirgenetic connection to the ‘serpent gods’. So, too, did ‘royal’ bloodlines inJapan and Central America. Chinese emperors were called ‘Lung’ or ‘Dragons’ andearlier ones were depicted with reptilian features. Qin Shi Huang, the first Qinemperor who unified China and built much of the Great Wall, was said to havebeen born with a ‘dragon-like countenance’. Emperors in general were describedas part-human, part-serpent. Japanese emperors were said to be related to‘Dragon Gods’ that came from the sky. The Nagas people in India were describedin similar terms. Accounts say that they could take either human or reptilianform and it appears that they expanded into Tibet and parts of China. TheBuddhist text, the Mahavyutpatti, names 80 kings of India who descended from theNagas or ‘Serpent Kings’. The Nagas were described as offspring from theinterbreeding of humans with the ‘serpent gods’, and Indian rulers claimed agenetic connection to them (Fig 105). In ancient Media – now Iran, with anempire stretching into parts of Turkey – they referred to their kings as ‘Mar’.This means ‘snake’ in Persian. They were known as the ‘Dragon Dynasty of Media’,or ‘descendants of the dragon’. Cecrops, the first Mycenaean king of Athens, wasdepicted as a human with a serpent’s tail, and another, Erechtheus, wasworshipped after his death as a live snake. It was he who founded the EleusinianMystery School through which knowledge was communicated only to selectedinitiates. Mystery schools were the forerunners of today’s secret societynetworks. Some were established with good intent, but most were created to keepadvanced and hidden knowledge in the hands of the few. Australian aboriginestell of a reptilian race living inside the Earth (true) which governs humanitythrough extensive technology. Aborigines say they are descended from a race of‘dragon-humans’ that lived on a vast continent in the Pacific Ocean (Mu orLemuria) of which Australia is a remnant, big as it is. There is a Greek legendthat says another king, Kadmus, became a live snake when he died. There has beenthroughout history a fundamental literal and symbolic connection between royaltyand the ‘serpent’. Egyptian pharaohs, who were said to be gods in human bodies,were depicted in the form of a cobra – a major symbol used by the ancients forthe Reptilian ‘gods’. They were given a cobra ‘headdress’, which had a cobra onthe forehead (third eye) and a cobra’s belly on the chin. The hybrid bloodlinewas also widely symbolised as people with the top half of their body human andtheir legs portrayed as snakes (Figs 106 to 109).image [../Images/00125.jpg] Figure 105: An Asian portrayal of the Nagas Reptilian hybrids were seeded into cultures throughout the world and they haveacted ever since as the visible light, five-sense vehicles for their hiddenReptilian masters. Why don’t the Reptilians just come out and take over? (1)There is a vibrational and atmospheric problem for most of them in staying inour frequency for long periods unless they remain in their ownvibrational/atmospheric ‘bubble’ through technological means; (2) It is farbetter for the target population not to know you exist when you are feeding offhumanity’s emotional energy and using more than seven billion people withouttheir knowledge as your slave race; (3) That very figure, seven billion andrising. Humans far outnumber their controllers. The Reptilian tyranny does notinvolve the entire reptilian humanoid species, only a renegade grouping, butthere are Reptilians doing to others elsewhere in the Universe what they aredoing to humans. You see their modus operandi portrayed in the animated movie, ABug’s Life, in the relationship between the few grasshoppers that impose theirwill upon a large colony of ants. The chief grasshopper says that the ants haveto be kept ‘in line’, because ‘they outnumber us a hundred to one and if theyever figure that out – there goes our way of life’. This is the relationshipbetween the Reptilians and humans. If you haven’t seen A Bug’s Life it is worthgiving it a watch. It is an excellent metaphor for what is happening tohumanity. The only difference is that the ants can see the grasshoppers whilehumans can’t see the Reptilians – only their hybrid vehicles.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [../Images/00126.jpg] Figure 106 image [../Images/00127.jpg] Figure 107 image [../Images/00128.jpg] Figure 108 image [../Images/00129.jpg] Figure 109 Reptilian hybrid royalty and bloodlines were often depicted as ahuman torso with snakes for legs and symbolised as a cobra.

They moved up through what is now Turkey and theCaucasus Mountains into Northern Europe and across to Russia where they becamethe royal families and aristocracy of Europe – East and West – often throughinterbreeding with Reptilian hybrids seeded into those regions (Fig 110). Theyestablished Rome and its empire, Ancient Greece, and the Khazar Empire in theCaucasus region, location of today’s Georgia, among many others. The story ofKhazaria is worth highlighting given its impact on the world today. King Bulan,the King of Khazaria, adopted the religion of Judaism in about AD 740 and thewhole nation followed suit. These people had no historical connection to what isnow called Israel. They only adopted the religion of Judaism. The Khazars movednorthwards into today’s Ukraine, Hungary, Lithuania, Russia and Poland whentheir empire crumbled. Many of them later headed west into Germany and WesternEurope. These are the overwhelming majority of what we call Jewish people todaywho are located primarily in Israel and the United States. The former Khazarpeople are known as Ashkenazi Jews (plural Ashkenazim), and some writersestimate that perhaps 90 to 95 per cent of those calling themselves ‘Jewish’worldwide are Ashkenazi. The Jewish writer, Arthur Koestler, said of thisre-emerging history in his book, The Thirteenth Tribe (Random House; 1999):image [../Images/00130.jpg] Figure 110: The expansion of the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines out of Mesopotamiaand Egypt > …[It] would mean that their ancestors came not from the Jordan, but from the> Volga, not from Canaan but from the Caucasus, once believed to be the cradle> of the Aryan race [hence ‘Caucasian’] and that genetically they are more> closely connected to the Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to the seed of> Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Should this turn out to be the case, then the term> ‘anti-Semitism’ would be void of meaning, based on a misapprehension shared by> both the killers and their victims. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it> slowly emerges from the past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax which> history has ever perpetrated. It is the case. What are called Jewish people today have no historicalconnection to Israel. This was just a fable concocted by the Reptilian-hybridHouse of Rothschild and others to justify the takeover of Palestine and createmayhem in the Middle East as part of a much bigger global plan. The mass ofJewish people have been ‘had’, as much as anyone else, and at great cost formany over the years. Zionism has nothing to do with what is best for Jewishpeople. It is, at its core, a secret society created and controlled by theRothschild global network to advance the goal of global domination. This is whyyou find so many Rothschild Zionists, as I call them, in positions of power allover the world in politics, banking, business, and media ownership, etc. Theseinstitutions are not owned and controlled by the mass of Jewish people that havebeen victims of this deceit. They are owned and controlled by the Reptilianhybrid network that has infiltrated all societies and races, and within whichthe House of Rothschild is a prime influence. The king of Khazaria,incidentally, was called the ‘Khagan’ or ‘Kagan’. Thus ‘Kagan’ became a common‘Jewish’ name. The Khazar story, and the fraudulent real estate claims onIsrael, have been uncovered by Jewish writers and scholars, including ShlomoSand, Professor of History at Tel Aviv University, in his book, The Invention ofthe Jewish People (Verso; 2010). He writes: > Even Ben Zion Dinur, the father of Israeli historiography, was not hesitant> about describing the Khazars as the origin of the Jews in Eastern Europe, and> describes Khazaria as ‘the mother of the diasporas’ in Eastern Europe. But> more or less since 1967, anyone who talks about the Khazars as the ancestors> of the Jews of Eastern Europe is considered naive and moonstruck. Of course they are. The Rothschilds and their creation, Zionism, hardly want tohave historians and others telling the truth and demolishing the fraudulentclaim to a historical right to Israel. I tell the Khazar story at length inHuman Race Get Off Your Knees. Stewart Swerdlow, who is Jewish, has compiled hisinformation from very different sources to my own, but we uncovered the samethemes. Stewart writes in his book, Blue Blood, True Blood (ExpansionsPublishing; 2002): > … [the Sumerians] mostly established themselves in the Caucasus Mountains and> [later]became the Khazars. From here, they spread west towards Europe, seeding> the national identities for the Vikings, the Franks, the Teutonic [German]> peoples and the Russians. Keep in mind that when Atlantis sank, some of those> refugees went to Western Europe and developed into the Celts. Some went to> Greece and others to the Italian Peninsula. These peoples were here before the> hybrids [Sumerians] moved in … These Blueblood leaders also infiltrated the> Middle Eastern peoples, such as the biblical Canaanites … The hybrid bloodline ‘elite’ families of the Roman Empire interbred with the‘elite’ families of the rest of Europe to produce European royalty andaristocracy. Swerdlow writes: > … Babylon was the civilization that Sumer developed into as it expanded into> Central Asia to become the Khazars. In fact, many of the Blueblood> organisations that developed through the millennia called themselves Babylon> Brotherhoods. [They] later combined with the secret Atlantean–Egyptian schools> in Europe to become the Freemasons. Some of these immigrants went by the name> of Bauer, now known as the Rothschilds. The family quickly took control of the> financial and trade foundations of Europe. The former Sumerian and Babylonian bloodline network, which became the Khazarsand Ashkenazi Jews, widely interbred with European royalty and aristocracy.Leslie Gilbert Pine was an editor of Burke’s Peerage, the publication thattracks royal and aristocratic genealogy. He said: ‘The Jews have made themselvesso closely connected with the British peerage that the two classes are unlikelyto suffer loss which is not mutual.’ This applies to the British royal family,too. Canadian researcher and writer, Henry Makow, whose grandparents suffered inthe Nazi concentration camps, said that ‘the marriage of Jewish finance andBritish aristocracy took place literally … spendthrift gentry married thedaughters of rich Jews’. Leslie Gilbert Pine said: ‘An ancient estate is likelyto be sold unless some large sums are found. The sums are found from marriagewith a Jewish heiress.’ The 5th Earl of Roseberry married the only daughter andheiress of Baron Mayer de Rothschild and later became British Prime Minister.Pine said that ‘alliances between Jewish ladies and British lords are mostly ofthis type, the wife providing large sums … while the aristocrat has the titleand ancient estate’. The Rothschild bloodline is always turning up in connectionwith royalty and aristocracy. Princess Diana’s mother, Frances Ruth Burke Roche,was a Rothschild. She is better known as Frances Shand Kydd. Tina Brown, formereditor of Vanity Fair, reveals in her book, The Diana Chronicles (Anchor; 2008),that Diana’s father could well have been billionaire businessman and cousin ofthe Rothschilds, James Goldsmith. Brown says that Diana’s mother was having along-running affair with Goldsmith at the time that Diana was conceived in late1960. There is certainly a close resemblance between Diana and members of theGoldsmith family. This would make Diana’s son, Prince William, a Rothschildbloodline on both sides through his mother and grandmother, and James Goldsmith,his ‘grandfather’. The Goldsmith family changed their name from Goldschmidt whenthey moved to England from Germany in 1895. They were close associates andneighbours of the Rothschilds in Frankfurt from the 18th century. Mayer AmschelRothschild, founder of the Rothschild dynasty, is reported to have met with theGoldschmidts in 1773 to agree a plan to bankrupt nations and control worldfinance. The meeting also involved members of the Schiff, Oppenheimer andWarburg families and other former Khazars. Well, there is no doubt that this isprecisely what they have done. The Rockefeller family (formerly Rockenfelder)are also former Khazars who went to America from Germany. There has beenspeculation that Kate Middleton, who married Prince William at Westminster Abbeyin 2011, could also have Rothschild–Goldsmith genealogical connections. Hermother’s maiden name was Carole Goldsmith. You would certainly confirm theconsiderable Rothschild bloodline connection to the ‘House of Windsor’ (theGerman House of Saxe–Coburg–Gotha) if you knew their secret history. There willclearly be a Rothschild on the British throne should William become king. Buthow many more have there been?WHEN IN ROMESome of the places and cultures the bloodlines established have remained at theheart of their conspiracy to this day. Most notable is Rome, where the Christianreligion as we know it originated. Rome remains a global centre for theReptilian-hybrid secret-society network that established and controls the RomanChurch, or Roman Catholic Church as it became. Elite secret societies in theglobal web, such as the Jesuits, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar and Opus Deiare all closely connected to the Vatican. The Reptilians and their hybridsestablished all the major religions, and most of the smaller ones. Christianity,Judaism and Islam, among others, all came out of the lands formerly dominated bySumer and Babylon and the wider Middle East. Translations of the ancient claytablets found in what is now Iraq prove beyond doubt that the biblical OldTestament, a pillar of Judaism and Christianity – and also connected to Islam –is a rehash and revamp of much older accounts from Sumer and beyond employingdifferent locations and names for the heroes and characters. The story of Mosesbeing found in the bulrushes was told long before in the very similar story ofSargon of Agade (Akkad), the King of Babylon around 2550 BC. We have alreadyseen that the story of Noah and the Great Flood had the same source. Bloodlinesfrom Sumer and Babylon took their satanic religion wherever they went. Theypractised it openly at first, but later they had to hide it behind symbolicrituals and cover stories. The ‘Christian’ trinity is the Babylonian trinity.The trinity in Babylon was Nimrod, the father, or sun god; Semiramis, or Ishtar,the virgin mother and goddess; and Ninus, or Tammuz, the virgin-born son. Thebloodlines that eventually relocated to Rome eventually hid their satanicreligion behind the smokescreen of ‘Christianity’ and the trinity of God, theFather (Nimrod in disguise); Jesus, the son (Tammuz in disguise); and the ‘HolyGhost’ or ‘Holy Spirit’. Christianity symbolises the Holy Spirit as a dove, andthis is how the Babylonians symbolised Semiramis/Ishtar (from which we get thename and festival of ‘Easter’). Titles and attributes that the Babylonians gaveto the goddess, Semiramis/Ishtar, such as ‘Virgin Mother’, and ‘Queen ofHeaven’, were bestowed on ‘Mother Mary’ by the ‘new’ Christianity in Rome. TheRoman Church, from which all Christianity originated, was only the Church ofBabylon relocated. You can see the progression in Figure 111 of the ‘virginmother and son’ from the reptilian figures found in graves of the pre-SumerUbaid people right through to Mother Mary. The goddess was symbolic of theplanet Venus, but also became associated with the Moon. The ancients symbolisedthe Moon as a ‘chariot’ of gods and goddesses. Selene, the Greek moon goddess,was depicted riding a silver chariot (the Moon) pulled by white horses; and theIndian god, Chandra, travelled on a moon chariot pulled through the sky by tenwhite horses. Roman Emperor Constantine decided what Christians must believe atthe Council of Nicaea in AD 325 when the so-called ‘Nicene Creed’ was imposedthat Christians are told they must believe to this day. Constantine wasn’t evena Christian. He worshipped a sun god called Sol Invictus, the ‘Unconquered Sun’.Most people didn’t have a problem when he decreed that Christianity would be thestate religion of the Roman Empire, or what was left of it. The ‘new’ faith wasonly their old religion under another name and guise. They had been worshippingdeities like Bacchus, the Roman version of the Greek Dionysus, and they weresimply being renamed ‘Jesus’. This is what was said about Dionysus/Bacchus:image [../Images/00131.jpg] image [../Images/00132.jpg]image [../Images/00133.jpg]image [../Images/00134.jpg]Figure 111: The universal goddess: The reptilian mother and baby in pre-SumerMesopotamia; Queen Semiramis (Ishtar) and Tammuz in Babylon; Isis and Horus inEgypt; and Mother Mary and Jesus in Christianity > Dionysus was born of a virgin on December 25th and, as the Holy Child, was> placed in a Manger. He was a travelling teacher who performed miracles. He> ‘rode in a triumphal procession on an ass’. He was a sacred king killed and> eaten in a Eucharistic ritual for fecundity and purification. He rose from the> dead on March 25th. He was the God of the Vine, and turned water into wine. He> was called ‘King of Kings’ and ‘God of Gods’. He was considered the ‘Only> Begotten Son’, ‘Saviour’, ‘Redeemer’, ‘Sin Bearer’, ‘Anointed One’ and the> ‘Alpha and Omega’. He was identified with the Ram or Lamb. His sacrificial> title of ‘Dendrites’ or ‘Young Man of the Tree’ intimates that he was hung on> a tree or crucified. Anyone heard that before anywhere? The same story was told about deities acrossthe world long before ‘Jesus’, including another Roman and Persian chap calledMithra or Mithras – he was ‘the vine’, the ‘good shepherd’, the usual deal. Ihave been to the Vatican a few times and it is full of sun god and moon goddesssymbolism, and Illuminati symbolism in general. The centrepiece at St Peter’sSquare is an original obelisk from Heliopolis, the ‘City of the Sun’ in ancientEgypt. They have stuck a little cross at the top to make it seem ‘Christian’(Fig 112). Nice touch. There is also an original ancient Egyptian obelisk in thekey Illuminati city of London. This is ‘Cleopatra’s Needle’ which standsalongside the River Thames – named after the Celtic goddess, Temesis. The Thamesis renamed the ‘Isis’ when it passes through the Illuminati indoctrinationcentre at Oxford. Isis is an Egyptian goddess and another ‘virgin mother’. NewYork and Paris have original Egyptian obelisks, too, in Central Park and in thePlace de la Concorde, which Princess Diana’s car passed no more than a minute orso before it crashed. The Paris obelisk is painted gold at the tip – the goldenpenis of Osiris. You can see the progression of the hybrid bloodlines throughtheir symbols, names and even architecture. One of the famous Seven Hills ofRome is called Capitoline Hill where they built the ancient Temple of Jupiter.It is called Capitoline because, the story goes, a human skull was found whenthey were digging foundations for the temple. The Latin for ‘skull’ or ‘head’ is‘caput’, which is why we use that word today to mean that something is dead, orbasically knackered. When the bloodlines that established Rome later locatedtheir centre of American government in Washington D.C., they called the building‘Capitol Hill’, the ‘Hill of the Skull’ (Fig 113). Some other State capitals dothe same, and the word ‘capital’ also has the same origin of ‘caput’. The humanskull and the skull-and-bones are major symbols for the bloodlines. We have theSkull and Bones Society alongside Yale University in the United States wherestudents from the bloodline, the future leaders and administrators of theconspiracy, including the Bush family, are officially initiated into the web asyoung men. The Skull and Bones Society was taken to America from Germany,birthplace of the House of Rothschild, and many of its initiates end up ininfluential positions in public or behind the scenes. US Presidents, Father andBoy Bush, are but two examples of Skull and Bones initiates who have had to lienaked in a coffin with a ribbon tied to their willies as part of the initiation.These people are running our world. The ‘crossed keys of St Peter’ that you findall over Rome and the Vatican is really a symbolic skull-and-bones (Fig 114). Wehave this theme in the story of ‘Jesus’, too, with the Bible saying that he wascrucified on a hill called Golgotha, which means ‘Place of the Skull’, as doesthe alternative word, Calvary.image [../Images/00135.jpg] Figure 112: The Church of Rome is the satanic Church of Babylon relocated andthe original obelisk from the ‘City of the Sun’ in ancient Egypt has been‘Christianised’ with a little cross.

The most famous symbol of American ‘liberty’ is the Statue of Liberty inNew York Harbour. But this is not a symbol of freedom; it is a symbol ofoppression. The statue is a representation of the ancient goddess known asSemiramis/Ishtar in Babylon and by other names elsewhere. Goddess deitiesinvariably relate to Venus and the Moon. Look at how the ancients depictedSemiramis and you will see where the Statue of Liberty came from (Fig 115).‘Liberty’ is holding the flaming torch that the Babylonians used to symbolisetheir sun god, Nimrod, and it represents the ‘golden seed’ of the 13 leadinghybrid bloodlines (Fig 116). The number 13 is a key number (vibration) for theIlluminati families and so we have the US ‘Super Congress’ made up of sixDemocrats and six Republicans with the deciding vote of the President – 13. TheStatue of Liberty is also standing on a symbol of the Sun. It is now clear to methat at least many sun gods that appear to be quite obvious symbols of the sunthat we know today are really symbols for what they call the ‘Old Sun’ and the‘Black Sun’ – Saturn. The reason for this will become clear in the next chapter.The key to it all is Saturn and the Moon, with Jupiter involved also.Semiramis/Ishtar was said to have come to Earth in a ‘moon egg’ and this becameknown as ‘Ishtar’s (Easter’s) egg’. Easter and Christmas are pre-Christianfestivals. The Statue of Liberty was given to New York by French Freemasons inParis who knew exactly what it was meant to portray. They have a mirror imagestanding on an island in the River Seine (Fig 117). The ‘Goddess Freedom’ on topof the Capitol Building has the same meaning, as does the Goddess Columbia andthe goddess holding the scales that is used to symbolise ‘justice’ (lack of it,more like) around the world. I said that Semiramis/Ishtar was symbolised as adove in Babylon. The Romans worshipped her as Venus Columba – Venus the Dove.The French word for ‘dove’ is ‘colombe’ and it is close to the Latin word‘coluber’, which means a snake or serpent. You find, hardly surprisingly,symbols of the goddess as the dove in St Peter’s Basilica in Rome (Fig 118).Washington D.C. is located in the District of Columbia. People think that thismust have something to do with Christopher Columbus, but it doesn’t. It relatesto Columba/colombe – the dove. The Mother Lodge of Freemasonry in London,established in 1717, is located in Great Queen Street. ‘Great Queen’ was one ofthe titles given to the Babylonian goddess. This London ‘Mother Lodge’introduced Freemasonry to America. Two other names for the ancient Venus/Moongoddess are Europa and Diana. Europe was clearly named after Europa. This makesthe Illuminati-created European Union the ‘Union of the Goddess’. The goddesswas depicted with 12 stars around her head standing on a serpent moon, and thisis the origin of the 12-star logo of the European – Europa – Union (Figs 119 and120 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos401809]). We have the European Union asa front for the Union of the Goddess and Washington D.C., the centre ofgovernment in the United States, in the District of the Goddess, or ‘the Dove’.This is not a coincidence. Earl Spencer, the brother of Princess Diana, said inhis address at her funeral service at Westminster Abbey that she was named afterthe ancient goddess, Diana. This was the Roman name for the Greek, Artemis, whois depicted in the Vatican. You can see her with the bees symbolically on herbreasts in the earlier image of the skull-and-bones ‘crossed keys of St Peter’.Bees and the beehive are a symbol of the bloodline and so you have thebeehive/skull symbolised above the crossed keys. Bees were also a symbol of theMerovingian bloodline which has come to prominence in recent times through bookslike The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and The Da Vinci Code. The Merovingianbloodline produced the Merovingian kings that ruled from AD 500–751 in what wenow call France and Germany. Legend says that Merovee, founder of theMerovingian dynasty, was seeded by a ‘sea monster’. This theme comes up quite abit. Legends about Alexander the Great, who invaded Egypt and Mesopotamia beforedying in Babylon in 323 BC, say that his real father was the serpent god,‘Ammon’ (Hidden). Alexander was known as the ‘Serpent’s Son’. Some writers claimthat the Merovingian bloodline is that of Jesus; but it’s not. How can it bewhen there was no Jesus? It is, however, one of the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines.The Merovingian kings worshipped the goddess, Diana, the ‘Mother of the Gods’.Princess Diana was assassinated in Paris, a city built by the Merovingian kings,in a tunnel called Pont de l’Alma. This translates as ‘bridge or passage of theMoon Goddess’. She passed the penis of the sun god (Saturn) in the Place de laConcorde minutes before she died. People take their tributes to a depiction ofthe flame held by the ‘Statue of Liberty’, the so-called ‘Flame of Liberty’,which stands on top of the tunnel on a black satanic pentagram (Fig 121[../Text/index_split_024.html#filepos402078]). Princess Diana has beenassociated with the rose since her death – ‘England’s Rose’, and roses onmemorials – and roses are used in churches to represent the womb of Mary. Romanscalled it the ‘Rose of Venus’, which was their name for the Babylonian Semiramisand the universal goddess of Venus and the Moon. Is all this really acoincidence? Everything is ritual and symbolism to these people, and whywouldn’t it be when reptilian genetics produce ‘ritualistic behaviour’? This ispart of the genetic software. We see it in the repeating and predictableritualistic behaviour among people in general, but the hybrids with theirgreater infusion of reptilian genetics take it to a whole new level. All thepomp, ceremony and pageantry connected with the British Royal Family are ancientpagan ritual disguised as Christian ritual and traditions of the State. TheCoronation of the British monarch is based on ancient satanic ritual andcoronations going back to places such as Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Royal Familyeven go to the same palaces at the same time every year and they are constantlyfollowed around by ritual and ‘protocol’ (ritual). This is why. By the way, Ihad a strange experience in Paris many years before Diana’s death. I went withLinda and the family for a day trip to Paris while we were on holiday in France.We stayed for less than an hour because it was so hot and oppressive. We got offthe train at the Eiffel Tower and walked across a footbridge to the other sideof the River Seine and rested for a while on a seat. We then went back to thestation and left. The next time I sat on that seat was in 1997 when I wasresearching Diana’s death. It was on top of the Pont de l’Alma tunnel.image [../Images/00138.jpg] Figure 115: How Queen Semiramis (Ishtar) was portrayed in the ancient world.Seen her before? image [../Images/00139.jpg] Figure 116: The Babylonian goddess, alias the ‘Statue of Liberty’, holding theflame of Nimrod, the symbol of Saturn image [../Images/00140.jpg] Figure 117: The mirror-image of the ‘Statue of Liberty’ (the Babylonian goddess)on an island in the River Seine in Paris image [../Images/00141.jpg] Figure 118: Nimrod the Black Sun (Saturn) and the dove of the Babylonian goddessbehind the Chair of St Peter. image [../Images/00142.jpg] Figure 119: The goddess with the twelve stars around her head standing on theserpent moon.

The reason for the focus on the Moon and Saturn will becomeclear in the next chapter. The Sumerians worshipped the Moon under many namesand the later Assyrians, Babylonians and Akkadians in Mesopotamia worshipped themoon god under the name ‘Sin’. This is the origin of the Christian concept of‘sin’ and ‘sinner’. Sin was known as the ‘God of the Mountain’ and so we haveMount Sinai – Sin-ai – where the Bible claims that ‘God’ gave the TenCommandments to ‘Moses’. We also have the biblical ‘Wilderness’ or ‘Desert ofSin’ in the story (and it is only a story) of the Israelites. Pre-Islam Arabiansworshipped the moon god, the ‘god above all others’, and his major shrine was at… Mecca. The Arabian moon god before Islam was called ‘al-ilah’, or ‘al-ilah’,and later ‘Allah’. The man who later became the ‘Prophet Mohammed’ grew up in afamily that worshipped the moon god, Allah. The Prophet decided that rather thanAllah being ‘above all the gods’, he was going to be the only god. Islam wasborn as a monotheistic – moon-otheistic – religion that worships the Moon andSaturn, while 98 per cent of its followers have no idea that they are doing so.The same happened with Judaism when the worship of multiple gods became theworship of one god; and in Christianity when the multi-god religion of Romemorphed into one-god worship. The Pantheon in Rome, which means ‘to every god’,was given a makeover to become a place of one-god Christianity. I wonder whatall the others did with themselves. ‘Sorry, mate, no work here, there’s no callfor gods these days now we only have one.’ Worship of the Moon is highlysignificant. Jews begin their month with the new moon and have the Passover onthe full moon, while the ‘Christian’ Easter (the Babylonian goddess, Ishtar) isheld on the first Sunday after the full moon. They’re all worshipping the bloodyMoon, and they are crucially worshipping Saturn, as we shall see. Christianitycondemns and demonises Pagan religions – when it is one. What a hoot! Wadingthrough ancient mythology can be a nightmare with all the different gods andgoddesses and the different interpretations of their meaning. This is especiallyso when there are so many other subjects to be looked at in detail before thedots can be connected; but during the writing of this book so many pennies havedropped and nearly all of them led me to the Moon and Saturn. I had read in afew places that the Jewish god, El, as in Isra-El, was connected to the Moon.However, it is really a version of the god, Saturn. Judaism is Saturn worship(on Saturday or Saturn-day) with the Moon thrown in among other things; and Zionis used as code for Saturn, too. Zionism, the creation of the House ofRothschild, is Saturnism. The vast majority of Jews don’t know this, but theirleaders sure as heck do. Muslims say that the Kaaba at Mecca, the most sacredplace in Islam, was built by ‘Abraham’, who the Bible says came from ‘Shinar’(Sumer/Mesopotamia) and seeded the ‘Israelites’. Abraham is a major figure inJudaism, Islam and Christianity, and all three religions place major importanceon Jerusalem. The name URU-SA-LIM has been found on Sumerian and Babyloniantablets. Do we really think that it is mere coincidence that two religions,Judaism and Islam, which claim to be different, both insist that animals areslaughtered in the same way in line with the food laws known as Kosher andHalal? All these religions have the same source and they were created, as withall the others, to program the minds of the people; create a rigid controlstructure and hierarchy; and divide and rule by playing one off against anotherand also dividing them into their own warring factions. Hasn’t worked, has it?The bloodlines passed through history expanding the reach of their religious andpolitical blueprint. The Roman eagle became the American eagle, the German eagleand many others. The Roman Senate became the American Senate; and now the UKgovernment is talking about replacing the House of Lords, the second chamber ofthe British Parliament, with a ‘Senate’. Buildings in Washington D.C. are basedon those in ancient Rome, as are many in London. Washington D.C. was even builton land called ‘Rome’ that was donated by the family of America’s first RomanCatholic bishop, the Jesuit John Carroll, a close associate of bloodline asset,Benjamin Franklin. The Jesuits are the major secret society connected to theRoman Church and a potent force in the global web of manipulation. They areruled by a ‘Superior General’, widely known to researchers as the ‘Black Pope’.Most Americans are not aware of the Roman Church’s influence in theestablishment and location of their capital, Washington D.C., via the JesuitCarroll family. For sure, they would not have put Washington in the District ofthe Goddess at this location except for energetic and ritual reasons – its placeon the Earth’s energy grid, possibly an inter-dimensional ‘gateway’ or what isunderneath the ground. It has felt like entering another energetic ‘world’,almost another dimension, whenever I have been there. It’s a very strange place.FOR QUEEN AND COUNTRY? ER, NO, JUST THE QUEENRoyal families and the ‘divine right to rule’ were the means through which theReptilian Alliance and its hybrid bloodlines imposed their human tyranny untilthe last few hundred years. They had to change that modus operandi when peoplebegan to rebel against royal dictatorships and the hybrids took control of the‘dark-suit’ professions such as politics, banking and business. Some royalfamilies have survived and now hide their true power behind the façade that theyare ‘purely ceremonial and symbolic’. Well, that is certainly not the case withthe British Royal Family for a start. Queen Elizabeth II, the British head ofstate, still has enormous influence, both by law and in the background (Fig122). Politicians, military personnel, police officers, the judiciary and thoseworking for Intelligence agencies, even the clergy, have to pledge their oath ofallegiance to the Queen … not to the population of the country. The Queen is therepresentative of the ‘Crown’, which is far more than the monarch, as I explainin other books. The monarch is only the ‘face’ of the ‘Crown’ which is onceagain a bloodline network of secret societies. Members of Parliament who are, intheory, elected by the public, have to take this oath: ‘I … swear by AlmightyGod that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty QueenElizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.’ Nowonder the Queen refers to ‘my’ government and ‘my’ Parliament. Judges have totake the same oath, and police officers have to pledge that they ‘do solemnlyand sincerely declare and affirm that I will well and truly serve the Queen’.Anyone who wants to be a soldier (why?) has to say:image [../Images/00145.jpg] Figure 122: Queen Elizabeth II – certainly not a ‘symbolic’ monarch > ‘I … swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to> Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her Heirs and Successors, and that I> will, as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, Her Heirs> and Successors, in Person, Crown and Dignity against all enemies, and will> observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, and of> the generals and officers set over me. So help me God.’ ‘My’ military, then. Even boy scouts and girl guides have to pledge allegianceto the lady with the scowling face. It was even suggested by one idiot in theBlair government that school-leavers should be encouraged to swear an oath ofallegiance to Queen and country, with the offer of tax and student fee rebatesfor those who volunteered. They are not the British royal family, anyway. Theyare the German House of Saxe–Coburg–Gotha from the land of the Rothschilds. Theyonly changed their name to ‘Windsor’ during the First World War for PR reasonswhen Britain was at war with the German wing of the family. The German‘Battenberg’ became ‘Mountbatten’ at the same time and for the same reason. Thismakes Lord Mountbatten, once a major figure in the Royal Family, LordBattenberg. The same theme applies to all the surviving royal families ofEurope. They are one family under different names – the same hybrid bloodline.The British royal family is German, Danish, Greek and Russian; the Swedish royalfamily is German (Saxe–Coburg–Gotha), Prussian and British; the Spanish royalfamily is British, French, Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Danish and Habsburg(a major Reptilian hybrid bloodline); the Dutch royal family is German, Britishand Russian; the Norwegian royal family is British, German, Danish, Swedish andPrussian; and the Danish royal family is British, German, Swedish, Russian andGreek. The Belgian ‘royal family’ is still another manifestation of the German(Rothschild) house of Saxe–Coburg–Gotha. The royal ‘families’ operate like acorporation with different branches of the same family acting as CEOs indifferent countries. What is it that gives them the right to be heads of stateand for their family members to follow as a matter of course? Their bloodline;their DNA. This is still going on in the so-called ‘modern world’, but most ofthe Reptilian bloodline ‘elite’ do not wear crowns anymore – well, except attheir rituals. They wear dark suits in public to pursue their dark intentions.The British monarchy, as with all of them, is the most racist of institutions.Only one family can be head of state, which, in effect, limits that power andprivilege to white people of one bloodline that must believe (at leastofficially) in only one form of one religion – protestant Christianity. Thishappens in a country that officially claims to abhor racism. The whole conceptof monarchy has to go if the human race is going to progress into adulthood. Afew years ago, I made a complaint about this racist institution to a governmentorganisation called, at the time, the Commission for Racial Equality. This issupposed to investigate examples of racism, but, as a government-fundedoperation, the cases that it pursues are carefully selected. My request for aninvestigation into this institutionalised racism called ‘the monarchy’ wasdeclined. Oh really? I’m shocked. Mind you, it would have been ratherembarrassing for the head of the organisation, a guy called Trevor Phillips, whoonce kneeled before the Queen (more ritual) to receive her patronage when he wasmade an ‘OBE’, or Order of the British Empire. What a joke it all is.THE POLITICAL FLY-TRAPThe bloodlines changed their strategy when the people began to rebel againstopen rule by royalty and introduced what we call the ‘political system’. Thishas allowed them to continue their tyranny under the cover of ‘democracy’ and‘power to the people’. Most importantly, they imposed the pyramidal structuresknown as political ‘parties’. There was a great danger during this transitionfrom royal dictatorship that people might vote for independent politicalcandidates on the grounds of their character, views and attitudes; and it is farmore difficult to control events with hundreds of individuals coming frommultiple directions. They might even look at proposals and policies on theirindividual merits before deciding how to respond. Oh, no! Nightmare! Theystopped all that nonsense, however, with the concept of political parties. Theseare pyramidal hierarchies and you only have to control the few at the top tocontrol everyone else in the pyramid. There is virtually no chance of beingelected today unless you are attached to a party, because of access to fundingand promotion. So you have to pick your party, and, to be elected, the partyhierarchy has to select you to run for Parliament or Congress. You have to be‘acceptable’ to the party big-wigs to win their approval and so you must ‘toethe party line’. You must do and say what the party wants you to do and say. Youmust defend what you may not agree with, even campaign for it, when the partyhierarchy decides what you must believe. You have to do exactly the same if youare elected to Parliament. You have to vote the way you are told to vote and saywhat you are told to say if you want to climb the greasy pole and ultimately gointo government. Political parties even have something called ‘Whips’ that havethe job of ensuring that party politicians vote as demanded by the peak of theirpyramid. ‘Party unity’ is another way of saying ‘everyone does as they’re told’.Let’s have a lot more independent dis-unity, I say. The Whip will offerpotential rebels some reward for voting the way they are told to vote. If thatdoesn’t work, it will be pointed out that further advancement in the party willbe blocked if they go ahead and think for themselves; and if that doesn’t do thetrick, the Whip might indicate that some dark secret could just seep out to themedia unless they come to heel and stop following their conscience. This, ladiesand gentlemen, is what they call ‘democracy’, a word that we are told isinterchangeable with ‘freedom’. It is not. ‘Democracy’ is a tyranny masqueradingas a ‘free society’. Go to the next level of this ‘party system’ and you can seewhy the public vote is irrelevant. The bloodline hybrids don’t only control oneparty in each country; they control any party that has any chance of forming agovernment, and at least most of those who don’t. It doesn’t matter which‘party’ gets into government, because the same force is always in control. Thisis why there is no change of direction, no matter if the government is ‘left’,‘right’ or ‘centre’. Barack Obama – ‘Mr Change’ – has actually changed nothingsince he became President of the United States in 2009. He has not onlycontinued the policies of Boy Bush – he has expanded on them. The point is, yousee, that there is no contract between the public and the politicianscampaigning for their vote. There is no obligation whatsoever for them to do inoffice what they said they would do during an election campaign. They tell youwhat they think you want to hear so that you vote them into power and then theydo what they were always going to do – follow the agenda of human enslavementdictated by the real power in the shadows. Obama says that he will closeGuantanamo Bay within a year, and once in office he says he won’t. Virtually allpoliticians, especially those in high office, are liars and frauds, but Obama isa Fraud of Frauds. Obama is, like Tony Blair, a classic Illuminati frontman. Sayone thing and do another, while always smiling for the camera. Another aspect ofthe political stitch-up is the dynamic between the party in government and theparty in opposition. It goes like this: The party in government introduces thebloodline agenda, because it has the power to do so through legislation. Theparty or parties that are not in government oppose the agenda, because itdoesn’t matter – they don’t have the power to do anything. Then we have a farcecalled an election and the governing party becomes opposition and the oppositionparty becomes the government. Now the party in government that opposed theagenda in opposition introduces the agenda, because it has the power to do so.The party that was in government now opposes the agenda that it had previouslybeen introducing, because it doesn’t have the power to do anything. The wholething is a charade to trick the people into thinking that they have a politicalchoice. This means that nothing changes when one party replaces another ingovernment. You may have noticed. This is how the bloodlines maintained theircontrol over governments when the monarchies fell.LONDON CALLINGThe Reptilian hybrid bloodline network eventually re-located to London, whichbecame, and still is, one of the major centres for the global conspiracytogether with Rome. This applies to London in general, but the bloodline focalpoint is in what is called ‘The City’, the original London, which is today thefinancial district, or ‘Square Mile’, dominated by St Paul’s Cathedral onLudgate Hill, the highest point in ‘The City’. St Paul’s Cathedral is built onthe site where the Romans once worshipped the Goddess Diana, and this is alsowhere Princess Diana was married to Prince Charles. It’s all ritual. The Romansestablished London, or Londinium, as the English capital (capitol), and manyRoman remains have been discovered here, including the Temple of Mithras (theRoman ‘Jesus’). The boundaries of The City have been virtually unchanged sincethe Middle Ages. The emblem of The City is, very appropriately, two flyingreptiles holding a shield with a red cross on a white background – the symbol ofthe Knights Templar (Fig 123). This is an elite secret society which, like theKnights of Malta, goes back to the 12th century. Both have fundamental links toJerusalem and Rome. The Knights Templar is a dominant force in The City and inthe centre of the British legal system in an area known as ‘The Temple’, whichborders The City. The temple in question is an original Knights Templar templethat was featured in The Da Vinci Code. Land that is now The Temple district wasowned by the Knights Templar centuries ago. They still control the courts andlegal system there and ensure that lawyers, barristers and judges do the ‘rightthing’ – the hybrid bloodlines’ ‘thing’. At the point where The City meets TheTemple is a depiction of a flying reptile in the centre of the road (Fig 124).The City has its own government and police force and operates, though notofficially, very much like the Vatican in Rome. It is a country within acountry. The rest of London has a ‘Mayor of London’, but The City has its own‘Lord Mayor of London’ (‘Lord’ is Saturn, the ‘Dark Lord’), who is always a highdegree Freemason. The City is controlled by a network of Reptilian hybrid secretsocieties and, once again, when you look at the architecture, including theRothschild-controlled Bank of England, where does it remind you of? (Fig 125)The City is also awash with ancient Babylonian/Roman/Greek symbolism. Europe isthe operational centre of the bloodline global network, especially London andRome, but also countries such as France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium. TheEuropean Union and NATO have their headquarters in the Belgian capital,Brussels. I am not talking here about the governments of those countries. Theyare only vehicles to make manifest the Illuminati agenda. I mean the centre ofthe global secret-society web at operational level. North America is alsovitally important to them, obviously, but so often the bullets are secretlyloaded in Europe for the United States to publicly fire. Anotherright-in-the-front-line player is Israel. This is a fiefdom of the Rothschildsand a global centre for worship of the Illuminati ‘god’, Saturn, via threereligions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.image [../Images/00146.jpg] Figure 123: The emblem of ‘The City’ image [../Images/00147.jpg] Figure 124: Where The City meets The Temple image [../Images/00148.jpg] Figure 125: Roman architecture in The City The world was colonised from Europe – Europa. This was done mostly from theIlluminati stronghold of London through the ‘Great’ (in size only) BritishEmpire on which ‘the sun never set’. France, Belgium, Germany, Spain andPortugal stole their share of other peoples’ lands, too, and the force behindall of them was the Reptilian hybrids. They had, by now, infiltrated all thecountries of Europe. Colonisation was the time when the bloodlines’ controlexpanded very rapidly to the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand andthe Far East in a grotesque frenzy of violent acquisition and exploitation bythe countries that bizarrely still claim today to have ‘values’ and stand for‘freedom’ and ‘peace’. Colonisation allowed the bloodlines and their secretsocieties to be exported across the world, and when the colonies were giventheir ‘independence’, that structure stayed put. European governments (thebloodlines) withdrew from the former colonies officially and on the surface, butthe bloodlines remained under many names along with the secret-society networkthat manipulates them and their agents into power. They have, as a result,continued to covertly control those ‘former’ colonies, including the UnitedStates, ever since. The apparent end of European colonialism was a sleight ofhand that exchanged one form of control for something far more effective. Thereare two forms of mass control – the seen and the unseen. The ‘seen’ aretyrannies like fascism, communism and apartheid. The people oppressed by theseregimes at least know that they are controlled and pretty much who by, in termsof the front-people. They may be in a prison cell, but they can at least see thebars. These forms of tyranny have a finite life, because eventually rebellionwill come. European colonialism was replaced by covert control and manipulationbehind a façade of ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’. This is the prison without thebars that people can’t see. ‘Democracy’ means to have a vote every four or fiveyears to ‘select’ which mask on the same face will be elected into office tocontinue Illuminati business-as-usual. People are told all the time that theylive in a ‘free country’ to stop them realising that they don’t. While thecolonialists appeared to leave the former colonies, such as the United States,Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the bloodlines and their secret-societynetwork have continued to control and manipulate those countries ever since inline with the demands of the Illuminati bloodlines. Meanwhile, the people beingcontrolled and manipulated have believed they were living in independent states.‘Physical’ control in regions like Africa and South America was replaced byfinancial control as puppet leaders from the bloodlines, or owned by thebloodlines, were placed into power in country after country to maintain them asIlluminati vassals, steal their resources and drown them in debt to theIlluminati banks – the coldly engineered ‘Third World debt’. Zulu shaman, CredoMutwa, told me that genealogy is very important in his culture and he hasstudied it deeply. He said that most of the black African leaders that came topower after ‘independence’ were descended from the ‘royal’ lines of ancientAfrica seeded by the ‘Chitauri’.THE BLUEPRINTThe Reptilian hybrid bloodlines have constructed a vast global web ofinterconnected families and secret societies that operate like a transnationalcorporation along the lines of Coca-Cola or McDonald’s. These globalcorporations have a headquarters somewhere in the world, and in each countrythey have a subsidiary network. The role of the subsidiaries is to introduce intheir country the corporate policy decided at the centre. The McDonald’s you seein America, Britain, Russia, Africa or Australia will be essentially the same.This is the way the Illuminati global web operates, too, except that instead ofsubsidiary companies we are talking about subsidiary families and secretsocieties. Each country has its own subsidiary network of bloodlines and theiragents, gofers and secret societies. Their job is to control the government,banking, business, media, military, and so on, in their country and change thesociety in line with the agenda dictated from the centre of the web in Europe(and Israel). A single plan for the direction of the world can be imposedeverywhere through this organisational structure. I have been to more than 50countries speaking and researching and I can tell you that the same is happeningeverywhere. This is how and why. But it doesn’t end there. The subsidiarynetworks in each country also have subsidiary networks that control regions ofthe country, towns and cities, and these operate in the same way. This is what Icall ‘The Blueprint’ (Fig 126). The ‘headquarters’ can, through thisinterlocking web, dictate right down into your local community. What are welooking at here? A structure that is holographic – every part of the whole is asmaller version of the whole. The world looks very different from thisperspective. You no longer see individual countries, political parties,governments, banks, corporations, media organisations and Intelligence agencies.You see one ‘country’, one government, one bank, one corporation, one media andone Intelligence agency owned or controlled by the same Hidden Hand. Thesituation is not quite that extreme yet. There are still some outsiders, but notmany in the positions of greatest influence. That is essentially the way it isand they are working now to complete the job of acquiring (stealing) anythingthey don’t already have. There is even a name for what they are doing –‘globalisation’. This refers to the centralisation of global power in every areaof our lives, and that is precisely what the bloodlines are seeking to achieve.The more you centralise power the more power the few will have over the many;and the more you centralise power the more power you have at the centre tocentralise even quicker. This can be clearly seen in the world today. They winthe game by owning the structure of the game that they have created. One oftheir widely-used techniques is licensing. They introduce laws, rules andregulations through their puppet governments and institutions that force peopleto have a ‘licence to practise’ or a licence to do whatever. Then they tell youwhat you must and must not do to secure the licence and, in this way, theydictate how everything is done and not done. They are moving in on alternativemethods of healing with their licence scam. They want to stop people having aneffective alternative to the pharmaceutical cartel, or Big Pharma. People saythat a financial crash must be bad for the banks, but it’s only bad for peopleworking for those that go under. If you own the game, the banking system, youcan’t lose. If you own the World Cup it doesn’t really matter if England beatGermany or Germany beat England. You still win whatever the result. Anyway, ifyou know a financial crash is coming, because you are going to cause it, you cansell at the highest point and then buy back in after the crash when values haveplummeted. This way you can massively increase your wealth, assets and powerwhen you expand the economy again and values recover. Nathan Rothschild, whoestablished the London branch of the family empire, famously did exactly thiswhile French Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Britain’s Duke of Wellington werefighting the Battle of Waterloo in what is now Belgium in 1815. The London StockExchange in The City would crash if Napoleon won, and the slavery-supportingNathan Rothschild knew that. The Rothschilds had the quickest and most effectiveinformation and espionage operation in Europe with an extensive network ofcontacts using codes and carrier pigeons. This network would later be known asMossad, British Intelligence and the CIA among many other names. These are allthe same organisation at the highest level. Investors in The City were wellaware that Nathan Rothschild would know the outcome of the Battle of Waterloobefore even the British government, and they watched him for any sign that couldgive them a clue. Rothschild suddenly gave the signal for his agents to startselling his stocks. A mass panic ensued as people took this as confirmation thatNapoleon had prevailed. The market collapsed and fortunes were lost in hours.Rothschild gave another signal to his agents to start buying on a grand scalewhen stocks had fallen to a fraction of their value. Nathan Rothschild had knownall along that Wellington had won and stock prices soared when officialconfirmation arrived. The London branch of the Rothschilds increased its wealthby an estimated 20 times in that single day.image [../Images/00149.jpg] Figure 126: The interlocking holographic global web that allows the centre tomanipulate right down into local communities Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00150.jpg] Figure 127: Countries may appear to be different entities, but the ‘blueprint’means that all are essentially directed by the same force from the unseen realmsdown to the bloodline secret-society web in each country. Those at the top ofthe pyramids declare wars, but they never fight them. They use the silly sods atthe bottom to do that. The House of Rothschild and their subordinate associates such as theRockefellers have continually manipulated the financial system in this way andothers. This has allowed them to accumulate the world’s wealth and resources andto own whole nations through unspeakable levels of government debt. Today wehave the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines in China owning much of America and thehybrids that control America have no problem with this. They are both working tothe same goal while appearing to represent different ‘countries’ (Fig 127). Theymay fight among themselves here and there, because that is their nature. But inthe end they are on the same side. China has become so wealthy thanks to NorthAmerica and Europe outsourcing much of their manufacturing to China and allowingother Chinese products to pour into their countries to destroy jobs at home.Even many key electronic components for America’s most advanced weapons systemsare made in China. Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GE (General Electric), is the head ofBarack Obama’s ‘Jobs Council’ while at the same time GE is moving vast amountsof its operation (and jobs) to China. There is no contradiction here, becausethe ‘Jobs Council’ is just for show. The United States has also outsourcedproduction and jobs to other parts of the Far East, to India and Mexico. Thebloodlines are seeking to destroy the United States and this is why hundreds of‘foreign free trade zones’ are planned to be established in America with specialcustoms facilities for countries like China to locate their companies. One ofthem, south of Boise, Idaho, could be controlled by the China National MachineryIndustry Corporation (Sinomach) if the state governor gets his way. The ChineseCommunist government is the majority owner. This would mean that eventually upto 50 square miles of America would be owned by China and they could storemilitary equipment and whatever they want. But it doesn’t end there. The Chinesegovernment is buying huge areas and assets of America including oil and gasfields. This seems utterly insane at first sight, but not when you know why itis being done. America is being systemically destroyed economically andmilitarily by the hybrids and their agents who control the government, whichever‘party’ is in office. They want to bring America to its knees so it can beabsorbed into their global structure of world government, central bank, currencyand army. The same is happening in Britain as Prime Minister David Cameron – afamily with close ties to the Rothschilds – follows the same script as hispolitical ‘opponents’, Tony Blair and the hapless Gordon Brown. The UK has beenselling state assets to overseas corporations for decades. Now you can see whyboth the ‘Republican’ and ‘Democrat’ governments in the United States have beendemolishing the American economy through outsourcing, through the North American‘Free Trade’ Agreement (NAFTA), and through all manner of other disastersdesigned to destroy wealth and jobs. It has been planned that way. The Reptilianhybrid families control the national central banks, World Bank, InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), Bank of International Settlements, European Central Bank,World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, United Nations, EuropeanUnion, NATO, on and on it goes. Control them? They created them – all of them –on their road to the incessant centralisation of global power (‘globalisation’)and the total control of every man, woman and child on the planet. > That is what is ‘going on’. Or part of it. The bloodline families that own the media and ‘entertainment’ industry ensurethat reptilian themes abound in modern ‘culture’, in movies, animations,computer games, science fiction and the like. This helps to embed the Reptiliancontrol system into the collective subconscious mind for reasons that I am aboutto explain. One of the most blatant examples was an advertisement featuringactor, Alec Baldwin, during the 2009 US Super Bowl, which attracted an audienceof some 150 million. It was promoting a media system called ‘Hulu’, and thetheme was of a reptilian ‘alien’ race taking over the planet by controlling theminds of the population. The script said: > Hello Earth. I’m Alec Baldwin, TV star. You know they say TV will rot your> brain? That’s absurd. TV only softens the brain like a ripe banana. To take it> all the way, we’ve created Hulu. Hulu beams TV directly to your portable> computing devices, giving you more of the cerebral, gelatinizing shows you> want anytime, anywhere – for free. Mmm. Mushy, mush. > And the best part is there is nothing you can do to stop it. I mean what are> you going to do? Turn off your TV and your computer? Once your brain is> reduced to a cottage-cheese-like mush, we’ll scoop them out with a melon> baller and gobble them right on up. Oooops, I think I’m drooling a little.> Because we’re aliens, and that’s how we roll. > Hulu – an evil plot to destroy the world. Enjoy. When Baldwin said ‘because we’re aliens, and that’s how we roll’, snake imageryappeared from under his jacket. You can see the advertisement on YouTube if youtype in the words: ‘Hulu Super Bowl commercial’. Television is mass Reptilianmind-control. Watching television activates the reptilian brain whichcommunicates and absorbs information through the medium of images.If you think all this has been mind-blowing, extraordinary and incredible, holdon in every sense. ‘Kansas’ is no longer in the cosmos. Wait for the next bit."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00151.jpg] Right – let’s go for it. We are decoding a fake reality to stop us from seeingthe true reality, which is very different to this one. We see a Universe that isapparently barren and lifeless, but this is a manipulated holographic projectiondesigned to make us feel isolated and alone. This is precisely what theReptilian Alliance requires for maximum control.The Universe is teeming with life of amazing beauty and variety, but we arebeing blocked from seeing it. The apparent limitations of technology and ‘spacetravel’ are also embedded in the projections to maintain our sense of isolation.Beyond this manufactured reality you don’t need technology to travel. You simplyuse your Consciousness. The voice in the Brazilian rainforest said: ‘Why do youfly from point A to point B when you are point A and point B and everything inbetween?’ The answer is that we don’t know that this is the case, and we are notaware of our true and limitless potential. We are decoding a false realitydesigned to enslave us in ignorance. Reptilian genetic engineering andmanipulation has tuned the human body–computer to the frequency range of what Icalled in my last book the ‘Moon Matrix’; but it involves more than the Moon.When I was a small boy, I had an experience that has turned out to be veryprofound in the light of what I now know. It happened on a visit to the LondonPlanetarium, and it was so long ago that I went to London on a train pulled by asteam engine (Fig 128). The trip was strange from the start. We were living from‘hand to mouth’ at the time, but one weekend my father said, ‘We’re going toLondon.’ We didn’t do things like that. We didn’t have the money; but in no timewe were heading for the railway station. Most of the trip is now a blur, but Ican still clearly remember the visit to the Planetarium, and one particularmoment that I will never forget. My father had no interest in astronomy, and Ican never recall him mentioning the subject once, but he took us to the LondonPlanetarium. Huh? Maybe it was because it was new. It opened in 1958, and thetrip could not have been very long after that. I didn’t know what a‘Planetarium’ was, or what to expect, but I was blown away when the lights wentdown and the night sky appeared on a big domed ceiling. Here I was the middle ofthe day and yet I was looking at the night sky! It wasn’t ‘real’, yet it lookedso real. This was a profound moment for me that I have never forgotten. It hascrossed my mind here and there when I have looked into the sky that maybe whatwe are seeing is not the vast and infinite universe that it seems to be, but aprojection of some kind. Like a colossal planetarium. I was sitting outside alittle café in the countryside a few years ago when I looked up and saw the skyas a vast dome. I remember thinking that we live in some kind of ‘bubble’. Thishas become ever more obvious to me in recent years. We are looking at aholographic projection that is designed to entrap us in a false reality (Fig129). This theme struck me again when I watched the film The Truman Show,starring Jim Carrey. This had been released for more than a decade by the time Isaw it on DVD, and I had to smile when I saw the ‘plot’. Carrey plays acharacter born on the set of a soap-type show, but he is brought up thinking itis all real. He lives in what he thinks is a town next to the ocean, but it isonly a film set. The sun that comes up and goes down every day is only aprojection. His every moment is filmed, although he has no idea this ishappening. He starts to question his reality when every time he tries to leavethe town something happens to stop him. The film concludes with him sailing offacross what he thinks is the ocean, but eventually he comes to the wall of ahuge dome within which he has lived his entire life. He finds a door and walksout into the ‘real’ world. This is such a metaphor for what humanity now needsto do. We need to find that symbolic ‘door’. What made me laugh more thananything is that the whole show was orchestrated from a command centre thatlooked remarkably like the Moon. I already knew by then that the Moon was notwhat it appeared to be. It is not a ‘natural’ body, but itself a command centrefundamentally influencing and controlling life on Earth. Quite a lot of what wesee in the heavens is ‘real’, as in part of the original virtual reality ‘game’,but it is holographically manipulated so that we see images that are not in theoriginal game and don’t see images that are. Many planetary bodies are not‘dead’ and lifeless as they appear to be. All of this is underpinned by blockingfrequencies, like a frequency fence, that firewalls the Matrix and humanperception from the greater reality.image [../Images/00152.jpg] Figure 128: The London Planetarium (as was) image [../Images/00153.jpg] Figure 129: The Universe that we see. ‘Real’? Or a projection? Most likely a bitof both THE MOON IS NOT ‘REAL’The information and insights about the true nature of the Moon came to me in theusual sequence. I had pondered from time to time over the years about whetherthe Moon was really what we believed it to be, but it was in 2009 that the truthwas put before me. I sat down to start another day writing the book Human RaceGet Off Your Knees, when the atmosphere in the room changed. I recognised thisimmediately given how many times it had happened. A very clear thought passedthrough my mind a few seconds later and, as I’ve said, I have experienced thisso often since 1990. The ‘thought’ said that the Moon is not what we think itis. The Moon is not a ‘natural’ heavenly body. This was another example of‘Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times he will be led toknowledge’. Both happened in this case. I entered a few key words into a searchengine to see what might come up and I immediately found a book called Who BuiltThe Moon? (Watkins Publishing; 2005) by Christopher Knight and Alan Butler. Theywere explaining why the Moon could not be a natural phenomenon. I ordered thebook, and other information along the same theme began to drop into my lap. Itwas the old sequence again: a new subject appears out of nowhere and then‘five-sense’ information begins to flow. Most people tend to accept withoutquestion what was here before they were born. Actually, most people tend toaccept without question – end of story. ‘That’s the way it is, mate, everybodyknows that.’ So the Moon is, well, the Moon. It’s always been there; it’s theway things are. But when you ask questions about the familiar and the ‘everybodyknows that’, you realise that the ‘everybody’ knows nothing. This is certainlytrue of the Moon. I mean, look at the size of it for a start. The Moon is 2,160miles in diameter and bigger than Pluto. What the heck is something that bigdoing as a ‘moon’ of a planet the size of Earth? It is the fifth largest moon inthe Solar System and a quarter the size of Earth. Ding-dong, hello? There isnothing in the Solar System that has a moon that big in relation to its ownsize. In the 1960s, NASA produced a detailed report – NASA TR R-277 – whichcatalogued all the anomalies and unexplained sightings on the Moon observedthrough the telescope between 1500 and 1967. This involved more than 300 peopleand listed more than 570 events that included unexplained mists, colours,extraordinarily bright lights, intermittent lights, streaks of light, unusualshadows and what appeared to be some kind of ‘volcanic’ activity. The Moon, andwhat is happening there, is nothing like the story we are being told.Christopher Knight and Alan Butler do an excellent job of detailing endlessmysteries and anomalies regarding the Moon, and the extraordinary – well beyondcoincidence – connections between the Earth, Moon and Sun in terms of size,placement, movement and alignments. They write: > The Moon is bigger than it should be, apparently older than it should be and> much lighter in mass than it should be. It occupies an unlikely orbit and is> so extraordinary that all existing explanations for its presence are fraught> with difficulties and none of them could be considered remotely watertight. Mainstream science has no idea where the Moon came from, or even what it is. Oh,yes, they will reel off the official party line but, like so much ‘scientific’‘fact’, it doesn’t stand up. It is not fact, just pseudo ‘fact’ produced byconstant repetition – ‘everybody knows that’. But they don’t. The first officialstory about the origins of the Moon was known as the ‘Big Whack Theory’. Thissuggested that a Mars-type planet struck the Earth during its formation and alarge chunk of the Earth broke away to eventually become the Moon. When thisdidn’t pan out, they came up with the ‘Double Big Whack Theory’. This is thatthe Mars-type planet smacked the Earth and then came back and gave it anotherslap. The old one–two. Excuse me a moment, I have a duvet that I need to put ina box that is far too big for the box. I am going to kick it, sit on it, getsomeone very large to sit on it, and if all that fails I am going to convincemyself, and then attempt to convince others, that the duvet is, in ‘fact’, inthe box even though it’s hanging over the sides in all directions. I should havebeen a mainstream scientist, you know. Earl Ubell, a former science editor withCBS, said: > If the Earth and Moon were created at the same time, near each other, why has> one got all the iron and the other [the Moon] not much? The differences> suggest that Earth and Moon came into being far from each other, an idea that> stumbles over the inability of astrophysicists to explain how exactly the Moon> became a satellite of Earth. Nor can they explain all the Moon mysteries and anomalies. Irwin Shapiro, fromthe Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, put it very well: ‘The bestexplanation for the Moon is observational error – the Moon doesn’t exist.’Either that or you change your perception of the Moon, open your mind to allpossibilities, and seek your explanations by looking at everything from anotherangle. First question: Do we really believe that the amazing ‘coincidences’ withregard to the Moon and its relationship to Earth and the Sun have happenedpurely by chance? Here are a few of them, as compiled by Knight and Butler:image [../Images/00154.jpg] Figure 130: The almost perfect alignment between the Sun and Moon makes the Moonappear to be the same size as the Sun when viewed from the Earth during aneclipse > • The Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, and at a solar eclipse it is> 400 times closer to Earth. This makes the Moon appear from Earth to be the> same size as the Sun during a total eclipse (Fig 130).> • The Sun is at its lowest and weakest in mid-winter when the Moon is at its> highest and brightest. The reverse happens in mid-summer. They set at the same> point on the horizon at the equinoxes and at the opposite point at the> solstices.> • Earth rotates 366.259 times during one orbit of the Sun. The polar> circumference of the Earth is 366.175 times bigger than that of the Moon. The> polar circumference of the Moon is 27.31 per cent the size of Earth and the> Moon makes 27.396 turns per orbit of the Earth.> • Multiply the circumference of the Moon by that of Earth and you get> 436,669,140 kilometres. If this number is divided by 100 it becomes 436,669> kilometres – the circumference of the Sun correct to 99.9 per cent.> • Divide the circumference of the Sun by that of the Moon and multiply by> 100, and you get the circumference of the Earth. Divide the size of the Sun by> the size of the Earth and multiply by 100 and you get the size of the Moon. image [../Images/00155.jpg] Figure 131: The relationships between Sun, Moon and Earth are ‘nothing less thanstaggering’ No wonder Knight and Butler conclude that mathematical and other relationshipsbetween the Earth, Moon and Sun are ‘nothing less than staggering’. They saythat the Moon has been placed where it is ‘with the accuracy of the proverbialSwiss watchmaker’ (Fig 131). That’s another thing. Life on Earth would not beanything like it is if the Moon wasn’t where it is. In 2010, I watched amainstream science programme on the BBC about the Moon, called Do We Really Needthe Moon? It was presented by a scientist who said she had been obsessed withthe Moon since she was a child; but not obsessed enough, it seemed, to go beyondthe official norm. She rightly concluded that the Moon was perfectly placed tosustain life on Earth. This was, however, a ‘cosmic coincidence’. They have tobelieve that or the house of ‘scientific’ cards comes a-tumbling down. The gamewould be up for the song sheet. Even if she had thought of questioning the‘coincidence theory’, it would either not have made the final cut or the BBCwould have hired another presenter who knows a song sheet when they see one. TheMoon is perfectly placed for life on Earth to exist; it is the same size as theSun when viewed from Earth; and it has an astonishing relationship in generalwith Earth and the Sun. Well, astonishing if you think it’s all a coincidence.Then there’s the fact that spin-synchronicity between Earth and the Moon meansthat we only ever see one side – one face – of the Moon looking our way. Thishappens, we are told, because the Earth rotates at a speed 400 times faster thanthe Moon, and spins 40,000 kilometres on its axis in a day to the Moon’s 400. Ihave heard some suggest that it doesn’t spin at all. Are we still continuingwith the ‘coincidence theory’?QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS, QUESTIONSMoon anomalies and mysteries are legion. The Moon is supposed to have formedfrom a chunk of the still-forming Earth, but the oldest rocks discovered on theMoon are said to date back 4.5 billion years. This makes them a billion yearsolder than anything found on Earth. Moon rocks have been discovered, accordingto mainstream sources, to be of a different composition to the dust in whichthey were found. The dust was estimated to be a billion years older. The Moon issaid to have next to no magnetic field, but Moon rocks are magnetised. Somerocks on the extremely hard lunar surface have contained processed metals, suchas brass and mica, and the elements neptunium 237 and uranium 236, which do notoccur naturally. Neptunium 237 is a radioactive metallic element, a by-productof nuclear reactors and the production of plutonium. Uranium 236 is along-living radioactive nuclear waste that is found in spent nuclear fuel andreprocessed uranium. What is this doing on a ‘natural’ moon? There is also thetitanium. The Moon is claimed to have been part of Earth, but some lunar rockshave contained ten times more titanium than found here. Dr Harold C Urey, winnerof the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, said he was ‘terribly puzzled by the rocksfrom the Moon and in particular their titanium content’. He couldn’t account forthis and he used the term ‘mind-blowers’ to describe the samples he saw. Dr SRoss Taylor, a geochemist who headed the lunar chemical analysis team, said thatareas of the Moon the size of Texas had to be covered with melted rockcontaining fluid titanium. He was bewildered by how heat could be generated todo that. How about super-advanced technology? Titanium just happens to be usedin supersonic jets, deep-diving submarines and spacecraft. This is what I amsaying the Moon really is: an incredibly advanced spacecraft/computer system,and the Reptilian Alliance has control of it. There is a colony inside the Moonsimilar to the ‘Death Star’ ‘moon’ of Darth Vader in the Star Wars movie seriesproduced by insider George Lucas. Darth Vader and company were the ReptilianAlliance in another guise. What the series depicted did not happen ‘in a galaxyfar, far, away’, but much closer to home. Lucas’s Death Star shows a remarkableresemblance to Mimas, a moon of Saturn, and that is no accident (Fig 132). I amcoming to Saturn and its many moons.image [../Images/00156.jpg] image [../Images/00157.jpg]Figure 132: The remarkable resemblance between the Death Star in the Star Warsmovies of insider, George Lucas, and Mimas, a moon of Saturn Talking of inside the Moon, the evidence suggests that the Moon is hollow. Inthe early 1960s, Dr Gordon MacDonald, a NASA scientist, said that ‘it would seemthat the Moon is more like a hollow than a homogeneous sphere’. He wrote thisoff as inaccurate data, but he was right the first time. Dr Sean C Solomon ofthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the evidence indicated the‘frightening possibility that the Moon might be hollow’. Cosmologist Carl Saganmade the point that ‘a natural satellite cannot be a hollow object’. Somescientists have suggested that the Moon has no core, and it is clear that thecentre is far less dense than layers nearer the surface. The Moon has only 60per cent of the density of Earth. This has also lead to suggestions that it ispartially hollow. Dr Lon Hood, leader of a Moon research team at ArizonaUniversity, said that what they found’ … really does add weight to the idea thatthe Moon’s origin is unique, unlike any other terrestrial body – Earth, Venus,Mars or Mercury’. It’s a gigantic spacecraft. NASA has smacked the Moon apowerful blow a few times after putting seismometers up there to measure theeffect. The result is still more confirmation of a hollow moon. An impactequivalent to one tonne of TNT caused shockwaves that built up for eight minutesand, in the words of NASA scientists, the Moon ‘rang like a bell’. MauriceEwing, a co-director of the seismic experiment, said: ‘It is as though someonehad struck a bell, say, in the belfry of a church, a single blow and found thatthe reverberation from it continued for 30 minutes.’ He couldn’t account forwhat had happened, and Dr Frank Press from the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology said it was ‘quite beyond the range of our experience’ for such asmall impact to produce this result. The Moon was later struck with an impactequivalent of 11 tonnes of TNT and NASA scientists said the Moon ‘reacted like agong’, and the vibrations lasted for three hours and twenty minutes to a depthof 25 miles. Alan Butler, co-author of Who Built the Moon?, talked about this toKen Johnson, a supervisor of the Data and Photo Control department during theApollo missions. Johnson said that the Moon did more than ‘ring like a bell’. Hesaid the whole Moon ‘wobbled’ in such a precise way that it was ‘almost asthough it had gigantic hydraulic damper struts inside it’. In 1972, when theMoon was hit by a meteor with the equivalent of the power of 200 tonnes of TNT,massive shockwaves were sent into the interior – yet none came back. The Moon ishollow, and NASA insiders – those who connect with the Illuminati bloodline web– know this. In 2010, NASA announced that the Moon was ‘shrinking’. The NASAwebsite revealed what it called ‘the incredible shrinking Moon’. The report saidthat a team had been analysing new images from NASA’s Lunar ReconnaissanceOrbiter (LRO) spacecraft and that ‘newly discovered cliffs in the lunar crustindicate the moon shrank globally in the geologically recent past and mightstill be shrinking today’ (Fig 133). The Moon is not what we have been told itis. NASA said they ‘bombed’ the Moon in 2009 in search of water, but you can besure that this was not the real reason.image [../Images/00158.jpg] Figure 133: One of the ridges all over the Moon that have led scientists toconclude that the Moon is shrinking NASA MOON COVER-UPNASA is a military and Intelligence operation whatever they may tell you, andthe organisation is controlled and directed by the bloodlines and thesecret-society networks. NASA was established by Nazi scientists who escapedfrom Germany at the end of the war thanks to American Intelligence and‘Operation Paperclip’. This was aided and abetted by networks of the RomanCatholic Church as I report in detail in books like … And the Truth Shall SetYou Free. NASA has been working from the start for the Reptilian Alliance interms of its controlling personnel. Wernher von Braun, a German rocket scientistand member of the Nazi Party, designed the deadly V-2 rockets that were fired atBritain in World War II. He escaped at the end of the war thanks to OperationPaperclip and he became the pre-eminent rocket engineer at NASA. The Saturn Vbooster rocket that propelled Apollo spacecraft was largely his design. He wouldhave felt right at home at NASA with his Nazi mates (Fig 134). NASA was createdby Nazis (NASA-NAZI) and they also brought with them the knowledge of how tobuild ‘anti-gravity’ craft that are called ‘flying saucers’ or UFOs. At leastmany of them are flown by human pilots. Most extraterrestrial ‘flying saucers’are far more sophisticated and advanced in that they can take any shape or size(what appears to be ‘size’ is only decoded information) and can manifest andde-manifest. Most people would be shocked that America would allow Nazisresponsible for mass murder to escape from justice and establish NASA; butanyone reading this book will see by now that the apparent ‘sides’ are forpublic consumption only. Joseph Mengele, known as the ‘Angel of Death’ when hewas camp doctor at Auschwitz, committed countless atrocities with his mindcontrol and genetic experiments on inmates, particularly children and twins.This didn’t matter in the least to the bloodlines, including the Rothschilds whoare supposed to represent the interests of Jewish people that Mengele tortured.He was taken to South America and the United States after the war to continuehis genetic and mind control ‘research’ with children under the pseudonym, ‘DrGreen’. One of the main locations for his ‘work’ in the United States was theChina Lake Naval Air Weapons Center in the California desert north-east of LosAngeles where most of the facility is underground. MKUltra, the notorious CIAmind-control programme, was exposed in the 1970s. ‘MK’ stood for ‘mind control’.They used the German spelling of ‘kontrolle’ in deference to the Nazisresponsible for it. I have talked at length with many people who sufferedhorrifically as children as a result of MKUltra. Words have no meaning todescribe what they went through. CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltrafiles to be destroyed in 1973, but it was eventually exposed. Amid the outcryand disgust at what was being revealed, President Gerald Ford ordered an‘investigation’ into the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. This wasironic, to say the least. Ford had been involved in CIA mind-control programmesfor decades (see: The Biggest Secret). The ‘investigation’ was about damagelimitation and was headed by … Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and known asthe Rockefeller Commission. It was, of course, a cover-up of what was reallygoing on.image [../Images/00159.jpg] Figure 134: Nazi scientists pictured at Fort Bliss, Texas, after beingtransported out of Germany by Operation Paperclip, also known as ‘ProjectPaperclip’ Most NASA employees don’t know what NASA really is. They are compartmentalisedfrom the truth and I have seen it suggested that NASA stands for ‘Never AStraight Answer’. There is so much going on that we don’t know about and much ofthe ‘information’ that NASA makes public is either inaccurate or designed tomislead. The ‘one giant leap for mankind’ Moon landing in 1969 certainly didn’thappen as portrayed. I am not saying that they haven’t been to the Moon at all,only that it didn’t happen the way they said in 1969. The technology necessaryto get to the Moon had to be far more advanced than the Apollo craft, and theyhad that available to them. It is called anti-gravity technology – or ‘flyingsaucers’ – and the American covert programmes had built such craft by at theleast the 1950s. The know-how came courtesy of the Nazi scientists brought overfrom Germany after the war and the Apollo programme was a cover for theanti-gravity technology that they wanted to keep from the public with all itsimplications for free energy and for other reasons. The ‘live’ footage of thefirst ‘Moon landing’ was shot in a studio by Stanley Kubrick, the great filmdirector, and they used the cover of his epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey, which wasmade at the same time. This has been brilliantly exposed by Jay Weidner,American researcher and filmmaker, in his DVD documentary, Kubrick’s Odyssey. Ican highly recommend this film and you can get a copy via the online shop at:www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com]. Former NASA employees, and thosewith experience of its work, have revealed how non-natural phenomena on the Moonwere airbrushed out of pictures before they were seen by the public. SergeantKarl Wolf was a precision electronics photographic repairman at the Langley AirForce Base in Virginia. (This is the CIA base where the planes were ‘scrambled’on 9/11 to ‘protect’ Washington D.C. when there were planes much closer at theAndrews Air Force Base only ten miles away from the Pentagon. The Langley planesdidn’t make it in time – exactly as planned.) In 2001, Karl Wolf told an eventat the National Press Club in Washington D.C. that in 1965 he saw pictures ofhuge structures on the far side of the Moon. He said that he was asked to repaira technical problem in a part of the base where they were putting together‘mosaics’ of pictures taken of the Moon to produce a larger image. Wolf saidthat the airman working with the mosaics told him: ‘By the way, we’ve discovereda base on the back side of the Moon.’ He then showed Wolf a picture of the basewhich had geometrical shapes, spherical buildings, very tall towers and whatlooked like radar dishes (Figs 135 and 136). Some buildings had reflectivesurfaces on them and some reminded him of cooling towers at power generationplants. Other towers were straight and tall with a flat top, or round with adome. He emphasised that many of these structures were vast. He estimated thatsome must have covered half a mile.image [../Images/00160.jpg] image [../Images/00161.jpg]Figs 135 and 136: Smudged-out tower-like images on the Moon This is a very important point. People need to redefine their perception of‘big’ if they are going to grasp what is happening. Remember that humans havebeen incarcerated in a mind prison for aeons. We don’t know what ‘big’ is, orhow such structures and technology of extraordinary size (to us) can beproduced. We have been living in a tiny, tiny perception bubble, and the cuttingedge of human technology (that we see) is the Stone Age compared with what ispossible. You can advance technologically and in other ways by the equivalent ofthousands of years in next to no ‘time’ once you cross the Rubicon into anunderstanding of what reality is and how it works. This is what we are dealingwith here – technological capability that makes even a lot of science fictionlook tame. Imagine you are sitting in a cave knocking rocks together and someonetold you that it was possible to build a Jumbo Jet or a space shuttle. You wouldsay it was impossible and crazy. The guy’s been drinking too much mammoth juice.But this is the kind of chasm that people are being challenged to cross in termsof their perception of the possible. The suppression of information, andtherefore the suppression of the perception of the possible, is one of the greatways that the true scale of the conspiracy stays hidden. This means that whenpeople like me say this or that is happening, the perception censor kicks in andsays: ‘That’s not possible.’ No, it is not possible for us to do it. Others cando it, and they are doing it. I have spoken with insiders who have said theyhave seen pictures of spacecraft around Saturn that are so enormous that fewwould believe it possible. Jose Escamilla’s DVD documentary, Moon Rising,highlighted a picture of a non-natural object on the Moon that had been smudgedin most pictures to obscure it. The one in Figure 137 is clearer. The picturewas sent for examination to forensics imaging expert, Jim Hoerricks, whoestimated that it must be as big as ten cities the size of Los Angeles. This isthe sort of technological capability we are dealing with and even that isnothing compared with what can be done, and is being done, elsewhere. A NASAinsider told the Moon Rising documentary makers: ‘We lied about everything.’ TheMoon is not colourless as it is portrayed and there are many colours on thesurface. I am far from convinced that it doesn’t have some sort of atmosphereand a much more significant gravity field. Remember: ‘We lied about everything.’A location of particular activity for centuries has been the Aristarchus Craterin the southern region of the Moon with reports of bright lights there since the17th century. You can see why when you look at the picture in Figure 138. Thestructure, which sometimes glows electric blue, is some 29 miles in diameter andhas been given the name ‘Blue Gem’ or ‘Blue Dome’. There has been speculationthat it is some sort of nuclear complex. It would appear that there are manynon-natural structures even on the side of the Moon that we can see (Fig 139).Making sure that we only ever see one side of the Moon means that they canobviously hide what there is on the other side from independent astronomers withpowerful telescopes. People would be shocked if they did see genuine pictures ofthe far side, because they would see that it is nothing like we are told. I reada book called Someone Else Is On Our Moon (W H Allen; 1977) that describescountless examples of non-natural phenomena on the Moon. These include hugemachines working in craters – which could start to explain how areas ‘the sizeof Texas’ could be covered with melted rock containing titanium. The book waswritten by George H Leonard who studied thousands of NASA photographs, talkedwith NASA informants and listened to hours of astronaut tapes. His conclusionfrom the mountain of evidence that he saw and heard is that there is certainlyintelligent life on the Moon. I agree, but in the Moon is where the real actionis. Researchers Richard C Hoagland and Mike Bara detail many more Moon anomaliesand non-natural features in their book, Dark Mission – The Secret History ofNASA (Feral House, USA, 2009).image [../Images/00162.jpg] Figure 137: A massive non-natural object on the Moon. What is it? image [../Images/00163.jpg] Figure 138: The ‘Blue Gem’ in the Aristarchus Crater SPACESHIP MOONThe concept of the Moon as a giant spacecraft (giant to our perception, anyway)was discussed in 1970 by two members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, MikhailVasin and Alexander Shcherbakov. They wrote a detailed article in the SovietSputnik magazine headed: ‘Is the Moon the Creation of Alien Intelligence?’ Theysaid that the Moon was a planetoid that had been ‘hollowed out’ with incrediblyadvanced technology that melted rock to create cavities in the interior (Fig140). This ‘metallic rocky slag’ was then poured onto the surface to create thelunar landscape. Dr Don L Anderson, a professor of geophysics and director ofthe seismological laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, oncesaid that ‘the Moon is made inside out’. The inner and outer composition shouldbe the other way round. Dr Farouk El-Baz worked with NASA on the scientificexploration of the Moon. He said: ‘There are many undiscovered caverns suspectedto exist beneath the surface of the Moon.’ Several experiments have been carriedout on the Moon to see if there actually are such caverns. Zulu shaman CredoMutwa told me that their legends say that there were compartments within theMoon. The Soviet scientists pointed out that if the technology used to hollowout the Moon involved nuclear power it would explain the mystery of the uranium236 and neptunium 237, and so would the ‘Blue Gems’ if they are nuclear innature. This also puts into greater perspective the mystery areas the size ofTexas covered with melted rock containing titanium. The Soviet scientists saidthat the high titanium content on the Moon’s surface, together with chromium andzirconium, can also be explained if the Moon is a construct. These are known as‘refractory’ metals which are extremely resistant to heat and wear. Vasin andShcherbakov said that that these metals would provide ‘enviable resistance toheat and the ability to stand up to means of aggression’. They said that youwould choose precisely these metals if you were devising a material to protect agiant artificial satellite from the unfavourable effects of temperature, cosmicradiation and meteorite bombardment. The scientists said that this would explainwhy lunar rock is such a poor heat conductor, and from the engineers’ point ofview ‘this spaceship of ages long past, which we call the Moon, is superblyconstructed’. They went on:image [../Images/00164.jpg] Figure 139: There are many features on the Moon that do not appear to be natural > If you are going to launch an artificial sputnik, then it is advisable to make> it hollow. At the same time it would be naïve to imagine that anyone capable> of such a tremendous space project would be satisfied simply with some kind of> giant empty trunk hurled into a near-Earth trajectory. > It is more likely that what we have here is a very ancient spaceship, the> interior of which was filled with fuel for the engines, materials and> appliances for repair work, navigation instruments, observation equipment and> all manner of machinery … in other words, everything necessary to enable this> ‘caravelle of the Universe’ to serve as a kind of Noah’s Ark of intelligence,> perhaps even as the home of a whole civilisation envisaging a prolonged> (thousands of millions of years) existence and long wanderings through space> (thousands of millions of miles). > Naturally, the hull of such a spaceship must be super-tough in order to stand> up to the blows of meteorites and sharp fluctuations between extreme heat and> extreme cold. Probably the shell is a double-layered affair – the basis a> dense armouring of about 20 miles in thickness, and outside it some kind of> more loosely-packed covering (a thinner layer – averaging about three miles).> In certain areas – where the lunar ‘seas’ and ‘craters’ are, the upper layer> is quite thin, in some cases, non-existent. image [../Images/00165.jpg] Figure 140: The Moon is a gigantic spacecraft, computer and broadcasting system Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) Craters on the Moon are certainly within the rough estimates of the depth of theouter layer that the scientists talk about before any impact would meet theimpenetrable ‘dark armouring’. Vasin and Shcherbakov said that the strangevariations in gravitational fields known as ‘mascons’ in the Moon’s maria plainscan also be explained from the ‘construct’ perspective. Any damage to the outerlayer, where it is especially thin in the maria, would likely be done byflooding the area with a lava-like ‘cement’, they said. This would make themlook a little like ‘seas’ from the Earth and it would also explain the extent oftitanium in these same areas: ‘The stocks of materials and machinery for doingthis are no doubt still where they were, and are sufficiently massive to giverise to these gravitational anomalies.’ I think there is a lot more to know whenit comes to the Moon and its level of gravity, anyway. The scientists said thatthe dramatically different ages of rocks and dust on the Moon were due to thecosmic travels of the spacecraft Moon that would have gathered material frommany places and of many ages; and the mysterious clouds of water vapour thathave been observed were a release of the gases that form an atmosphere withinthe Moon that sustains life. The scientists said that a large bulge on the farside of the Moon could be explained by the immense strength of a spaceship hullpreventing the Moon from breaking up. The Moon is not a natural body, at leastin its re-constructed form, and it is not impossible that it is totallyconstructed using the same materials that I have described. Our moon is notalone, either. There are many ‘moons’ that are the same. The companion to theZulu ‘Necklace of the Mysteries’, and just as old, is called the ‘Necklace ofthe Moons’. Legends say there are many moons like ‘ours’. There has beendiscussion over the years that Phobos, a moon of Mars, may not be natural. Marshas two moons: Phobos and Deimos, which are Greek words for ‘fear’ and ‘panic’.In 1959, Dr Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky, a Russian astrophysicist, is reportedto have said that Phobos could be an artificial satellite (Fig 141). He askedthe question in view of its strange orbit and indications that it could behollow. In 1963, Raymond H Wilson Jr, Chief of Applied Mathematics at NASA, saidthat ‘Phobos might be a colossal base orbiting Mars’ and he added that NASA wasconsidering the possibility. Dr S Fred Singer, special advisor to PresidentEisenhower on space developments, said the same. Mars Express, the Europeanspacecraft, took a series of close-up pictures of Phobos in 2010 and thefindings indicated that Phobos is lighter than it should be, could be hollow,and its composition is not like any known asteroids or meteorites.image [../Images/00166.jpg] Figure 141: The Mars moon, Phobos ‘CHITAURI’ MOONI rang Zulu shaman, Credo Mutwa, the oracle of African legends and accounts, toask what they said about the Moon. I didn’t tell him what I was putting togetherat that point. I only asked for any Zulu and other Africa legends about theMoon. He said that Zulu lore and other African accounts say that the Moon wasbuilt ‘far, far away’. Zulu myths say that the Chitauri manipulate the Earthfrom the Moon, where the ‘Python lives’, and that people were warned not toupset the Moon (Fig 142). ‘It is said that the Sun is forgiving, but never theMoon,’ he told me. Zulu legends symbolise the Moon as an egg, because they sayit had been hollowed out. They say that two leaders of the Chitauri, known toZulus as Wowane and Mpanku, stole the Moon from the ‘Great Fire Dragon’ and‘emptied out the yolk’ until it was hollow. They then ‘rolled the Moon acrossthe sky’ to the Earth ‘hundreds of generations ago’. It was said that the Moonwas a home of ‘the Python’ – the ‘Chitauri’. Remember how the ancient San peoplesay that humans were created by the Giant Python who came with his bag of eggsto the Tsodilo Hills. The symbolism of the Moon as an egg was widespread in theancient world and it was said that Semiramis/Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess,came from the Moon in a ‘giant moon egg’ and landed in the Euphrates River. Thislater became known as ‘Ishtar’s (Easter’s) egg’ and hence we have Easter eggstoday, as I said earlier. So the Easter egg is a symbolic Moon. Zulu legends saythat the Chitauri leaders, Wowane and Mpanku, were brothers and had ‘scaly skinlike a fish’. They were known as the ‘water brothers’. The clay tablets fromancient Mesopotamia also say the leaders of the Anunnaki on their Earth missionwere two brothers, Enlil and Enki. The latter was certainly symbolised in termsof water. He was known as ‘Ea’ in Babylonian and Akkadian mythology, which, fromthe Sumerian E-A, means ‘the house of water’. We are looking at the sameuniversal story about the Chitauri/Anunnaki/Nefilim Reptilians that began inAfrica. The fish was commonly used to symbolise the reptilian scales, and therewere many ‘fish gods’, including the Mesopotamian Oannes, or Dagon, the ‘Fish ofHeaven’. He was symbolised as having a fish head, and this is the origin of themitre worn by the Pope and many other Christian clergy (Fig 143). Christianityis a religion, like Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, ad infinitum, that worships theReptilian ‘gods’ and their Matrix; but only the inner elite know that (Fig 144).Surely, this can’t be true. I mean, we worship Jesus. Mesopotamian ‘Priests ofDagon’ wore a hat just like the mitre, but then the Roman Church continued allthe traditions of Babylon. It is the Church of Babylon relocated like the restof Christianity. All the Saturn and Moon symbolism that I have been describingstarts to fit into place now. They are symbols for the ‘gods’ (transformed intoone ‘God’) and their key locations – Saturn and the Moon.image [../Images/00167.jpg] Figure 142: Zulu legend says that the Chitauri live inside the Moon image [../Images/00168.jpg] image [../Images/00169.jpg]Figure 143: The origin of the mitre worn by the Pope and other Christian‘frocks’ – the Reptilian fish god, Oannes (Nimrod), as depicted in Babylon.

The Moon’s ‘physical’presence alone has a fundamental impact on life on Earth not least in relationto ‘time’. The word ‘month’ comes from moonth; and the female ‘monthly cycle’ isvery much influenced by the Moon. Some ancient legends say that there was nomenstruation before the Moon came, and the genetic manipulation that followed.Humans were androgynous, not male and female, if you go ‘back’ far enough to theReal Golden Age before the Reptilian hijack. Genesis says: ‘So God created manin His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He createdthem.’ The symbolic biblical Creation story claims that ‘God’ said of women: ‘Iwill greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forthchildren …’ The introduction of male and female was another means of divide,rule and separate. The Moon is in the ‘perfect position’ with regard to theEarth, and this not by chance or coincidence. The Moon affects the speed of theEarth’s rotation and so impacts directly on our perception of the passage of‘time’. It is the prime influence on movements of tidal water and the humanbody, which is some 70 per cent water, must also be significantly affected. TheMoon also has a major impact on human hormone production via the endocrinesystem of glands that include the pineal and pituitary glands of the ‘third eye’and connect with the glandular function of the heart. The Reptilians want tosuppress and close the human third-eye, heart and right-brain so that weperceive only five-sense reality. Many studies have found evidence that the Mooncan affect human behaviour at different points on its Sun-reflection cycle from‘new’ to ‘full’. This is where the term ‘lunatic’ comes from. The Moon hasendless effects upon Earth and its inhabitants simply by being where it is, butits impact is far more than that. Oh, just a little bit. I am now going to pulltogether many themes of the book so far: the nature of reality; theelectrical-plasma universe; cataclysmic events in the heavens; the Moon andSaturn; and the hijacking of Earth by the Reptilian Alliance. I have puttogether what I am now going to describe by following the clues, hints and ‘bigpointing fingers’ that have guided me to all the other information that I havecompiled since 1990. People will just have to make of it what they will, orrather intuitively feel. I am not telling anyone what they should think, nor doI wish to. It is only information for others to discern for themselves.I have said that we are experiencing a sort of virtual-reality computer game ofbreathtaking scale and advancement. Consciousness is without form in its primestate. We are simply awareness, and take form to experience different realitieswithin All Possibility. Cosmologist Carl Sagan said: ‘We are all made of starstuff. We are a way for the Universe to know itself.’ The ‘game’ is interactiveand there is a constant interchange of information between ‘the game’ (thewaveform construct, or Metaphysical Universe) and those experiencing the game –humans, non-humans of every conceivable kind, animals, trees, everyone andeverything. We can play the game or be played by the game. We can live life orlet life live us. It all depends on the level of awareness of the ‘player’.There is nothing malevolent about the ‘game’. It was created as a sort of cosmicvibrational theme park to allow the Infinite to experience itself through itsinfinite expressions. The ‘game’ was created with love, by the Infinite that islove: Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion. There islove that humans cannot imagine beyond the tiny frequency range that we aredecoding into a ‘world’. You cannot describe this reality; it must beexperienced to be understood. Zulu shaman, Credo Mutwa, has ‘died’ a number oftimes, only to be revived, and he has experienced what it is like beyond the‘veil’. I experienced this in the rainforest of Brazil in my ayahuascan alteredstate. I was talking on the phone with Credo while I was writing this book andhe described how this ‘love’, in its true sense, felt to him: > It is all the realities, all everywhere in every way; backwards and forwards,> left and right. No doors, no barriers; you are just there. You wish that every> human being, every beast could be there. You fall into an ocean. No top. No> bottom. It is Oneness. All is one music, played by one orchestra. You are the> One, the You, the Great ‘Us’. You want to embrace the entire cosmos. You don’t> see the Sun, Moon and the stars. You just say, ‘I understand.’ > I saw no angry African god, no Jesus, no Jehovah. I saw nothing. There was> only the music that comforted the soul. The music takes you on and on to where> the stars are not there. It is the real truth, a truth you cannot express. A> new self; a new reality. Love is deeper in this Oneness, deeper than the space> beyond the Moon. Creation is teeming with life and teeming with love, but it has beensystematically kept from us. Credo said: ‘They have taken every truth and madeit a lie called truth.’ He’s right. The world we think we are experiencing is alie, a fraud, from which we are soon to emerge. The frequency range that we‘see’ is just a vibration away from all that Credo describes, and so much more.Endless realms of form, and no form; full of love.There has been a series of cataclysmic events in the Solar System, including theone I mentioned that affected the entire galaxy and Andromeda. The wholewaveform construct of the galaxy was shaken and imbalanced, and the work beganto restore harmony. Waveform realities (the ‘Cosmic Internet’) are beamed fromthe centre of the galaxy and ‘picked up’ by receivers in sync with the differentfrequency ranges. What we call suns and stars are the main ‘receivers’,‘decoders’ and ‘amplifiers’, so are brown dwarfs, but everything ultimatelydecodes this information within the frequency band that it can access. Thereality that we are decoding, and therefore holographically experiencing, ismeant to be a far wider range of frequencies than we currently ‘see’; and it issupposed to be a world of love, joy, harmony and peace. This is clearly not thecase at the moment and hasn’t been for aeons, and this is because of what I willcall ‘The Hack’. Some of those helping with the repair and reseeding of thestricken galaxy became affected by the energetic distortions they were exposedto, and they began to experience what we would term a ‘personality change’. Thisis one meaning of the theme about ‘Fallen Angels’, and the Reptilian Alliance isan expression of that; but they, too, are vehicles for another force which, inthe end, will not be something that takes form. It will be a deeply imbalancedwaveform state that mentally and emotionally distorts their perception ofreality. What we call ‘evil’ is simply ignorance. This, in turn, is adisconnection from the source of love and wisdom that pervades everything. Thestory of the ‘fallen’ Darth Vader in the Star Wars movies of insider, GeorgeLucas, is a version of the theme I am outlining here. Darth Vader had once beena ‘Jedi’ Knight called Anakin Skywalker who fell to the ‘dark side of theForce’. The Reptilian Alliance in their ‘fallen’ perception had the intellectualknowledge of how reality can be manipulated to entrap others, but no longer thelove, wisdom and harmony not to do so. They are very clever, but have no wisdom.Cleverness without wisdom is a seriously destructive force. The Reptilians andtheir various associated groups began a process of enslaving worlds by hackinginto the waveform information beamed from the centre of the galaxy and somanipulating the reality of the target population. They have done this toendless worlds and one of them is called ‘Earth’. ‘The Hack’ requires them tohijack bodies with sun-like qualities, because they are created to bereceiver–transmitters of the multi-dimensional galactic game. The ReptilianAlliance had been interacting with the Earth and manipulating for a considerable‘time’ before they secured their sun – Saturn. This ‘planet’, and Jupiter, are aform of ‘sun’ (or ‘dark sun’) called a ‘brown dwarf’ and the Reptilians have theadvanced technological ability to use them to hack into the galactic informationstream to feed a fake reality to the target population. Brown dwarfs are theirmodus operandi and they have been doing this in many parts of the cosmos. Saturnsends out the main hacking broadcasts and this is amplified and directed at theEarth by the Moon. We are being subjected to ‘original Sin’ – the moon god.image [../Images/00171.jpg] image [../Images/00172.jpg]Figure 145: Why is Saturn a ‘planet’ like no other? Because it is a ‘converted’brown dwarf LORD OF THE RINGSThe Reptilian Alliance’s modus operandi is to first trigger cataclysmic eventson a target ‘world’, or solar system, and wipe away the society that was therebefore. Then Reptilians genetically-engineer a new species that is designed tobe ‘tuned in’ to their false reality – their ‘Matrix’ – and the planet ishijacked along with the perception of the people. They have done exactly this toEarth and humanity, and their means of doing so are Saturn and the Moon. Saturn,the ‘Lord of the Rings’, is the master control centre. I mean, just look atSaturn with all its rings (Figure 145). Saturn is a ginormous broadcastingsystem, and they will eventually find that the rings are full of crystals ratherthan ‘ice’ – a type of crystal that we aren’t familiar with on Earth. The ringsare not natural, and at one time Saturn was a conventional brown dwarf. It hadno rings. They have been constructed by the technology-obsessed ReptilianAlliance. Funnily enough, as I think about it, an insider once told me of aphotograph he had seen of an incredibly large spacecraft that appeared to be‘repairing’ one of Saturn’s rings. The process is ongoing, and they arecontinuing to construct others. In 2009, NASA announced that its Spitzer SpaceTelescope had discovered another ring circling Saturn from a distance of some3.7 million miles and going out to 7.4 million. It is so big that it would takea billion Earths to fill it (Fig 146). Some scientists say that Saturn’s ringswere created by the debris from a disintegrated moon; but how would that createa ring 3.7 million miles away from Saturn that could hold a billion Earths?Saturn’s broadcasting system extends throughout the Solar System, but most of itis not on visible frequencies. Saturn is the ‘Lord of the Rings’. And how did JR R Tolkien (and film director Peter Jackson) symbolise the controlling force inthe book and film of that name? As a fiery reptilian eye – the Eye of Sauron(Fig 147). Writers like Tolkien, a Professor of Anglo–Saxon at OxfordUniversity, and his close friend, C S Lewis, who wrote The Chronicles of Narnia,symbolising other dimensions of reality, knew a great deal more than theyadmitted openly. They used ‘fiction’ to portray fact. Saturn is the secondbiggest ‘planet’ in the Solar System after Jupiter, and is the sixth ‘planet’from the Sun. Its rings and moons make it unique. Saturn is called a ‘gasgiant’, as with Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, but it is habitable by verydifferent entities to humans much closer to its material centre, and, as witheverything, it exists on other ranges of frequency. Mainstream science says thatSaturn radiates 2.5 times more energy than it receives from the Sun, and itgenerates an unexplained constantly-spinning six-sided hexagonal wave pattern atits north pole which rotates in sync with Saturn’s recorded radio emissions. Amassive constantly-spinning storm system captured at the south pole also lookslike an eye (Fig 148 [../Text/index_split_026.html#filepos510428]). Is it reallya coincidence that the number six and the six-pointed star (an ancient symbolfor Saturn and more latterly the House of Rothschild) and the all-seeing eye aresuch predominant Illuminati symbols when Saturn has long been symbolised as aneye? Jupiter and Neptune also generate more heat than they receive. Saturn takesmore than 29 Earth years to complete a journey around the Sun. The ‘planet’(‘dark sun’) has been known about since prehistoric times because it can be seenfrom Earth, but it was only after the development of strong enough telescopesthat the rings were able to be seen. Babylonian astronomers recorded themovements of Saturn, and it was worshipped by the Romans as the god, Saturn (theGreek ‘Cronus’ or Kronos). There is no coincidence whatsoever in Saturn havingso many moons. More than 60 have been discovered so far (Fig 149[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos510797]). They comprise, with the Saturndwarf, a mini solar system and the same with Jupiter and its at least 63 moons.Most of Saturn’s moons derive their names from god Saturn’s brothers andsisters, the Titans and Titanesses. Small Saturnian moons discovered morerecently have been named after Inuit, Gallic and Norse gods and goddesses. Noneof this is by chance, and all are different names for the same deities indifferent cultures. Saturn’s biggest moon, Titan, is the second-largest in theSolar System behind the Jupiter moon, Ganymede, and is twice as big as our ownmoon. Titan, Ganymede and other major Jupiter moons, Io, Europa (the EU goddess)and Callisto, are really planets, though they are known as moons. Titan,Ganymede and others also play a very active role in the Saturn–Moon Matrix and Iam sure we will see the role of Jupiter in all this eventually. Even mainstreamscientists have suggested that some form of life could exist on Titan andanother Saturn ‘moon’, Enceladus. Saturn is communicating with the majormoons/planets and many not so major ones in our Solar System. I suggest that‘Earth’s’ moon was once in that group around Saturn, and at least many of themare the same in nature. They are computer systems, amplifiers and satellites ofthe Saturn broadcasting grid and they go out as necessary to target otherworlds. Saturn is not their only hijacked and converted brown dwarf either. Theyare experts at this.image [../Images/00173.jpg] Figure 146: The recently-found Saturn ring that it would take a billion Earthsto fill image [../Images/00174.jpg] Figure 147: The reptilian eye symbolising the controlling force in Lord of theRings "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00175.jpg] Figure 148: The hexagonal wave pattern at Saturn’s north pole and the ‘eye’ atits south pole "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00176.jpg] Figure 149: The Saturn solar system Saturn was often symbolised as an eye by the ancients and that is a likelyorigin of the all-seeing eye, one of the major symbols of the Reptilian-hybridbloodline network (Fig 150). I went to the subway station right next to GroundZero when I spoke in New York in 2010. The station has mosaic eyes on the wallsall along the platforms, and a large depiction on the floor of an eyebroadcasting frequencies across the planet (Fig 151). The eye is almostcertainly meant to be Saturn (Satan). The image perfectly portrays what Saturnis doing. Saturn hacks into the waveform information broadcast from the centreof the galaxy via the Sun and broadcasts a fake reality into the Solar System.The Moon amplifies this and beams it specifically at the Earth (Figs 152 and153). The fantastic synchronicities between Earth, the Moon and the Sun in size,geometry and position, are all made possible by the Moon. These synchronicitiesare connected to how the Sun’s information is hacked by Saturn and the Moon. TheMoon is where it is because it was specifically placed there. Visible light andthe electromagnetic spectrum that science can record is the Matrix, the falsereality. And ‘God’ said, ‘Let there be light.’ The speed of light which we aretold is the fastest speed possible (rubbish!) is the vibrational ‘wall’ of theMatrix. We are not even living ‘on’ the Earth as it really is. Some of it is‘original’, but there are many holographic implants that change it for ourperception. The Matrix broadcasts block humans from perceiving what we wouldotherwise be experiencing. The Earth that we can’t see is a place of love andharmony – not war, fear and suffering. The predators dictate our lives and makeus into slaves to them by hijacking our sense of reality. The Saturn–Moon Matrixtransformed a once-vibrant, conscious humanity into computer programs decodingcycles of repetitive perception and behaviour. Neil Hague symbolises this verywell with his concept of ‘Moonopoly’ (Fig 154). The transmissions of theSaturn–Moon Matrix are received and re-transmitted by the Earth’s crystal corewhich has been tuned to the Matrix frequency range, and the ‘Hack’ connects withus through the reptilian brain and the receiver–transmitter system that we callDNA. This brings us back to ‘junk’ DNA and what Professor Sam Chang is reportedto have said earlier – that the overwhelming majority of human DNA is of‘off-world’ origin and the ‘extraterrestrial junk genes’ merely ‘enjoy the ride’with hard-working active genes passed though the generations. He is quoted assaying:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [../Images/00177.jpg] image [../Images/00178.jpg]Figure 150: Saturn symbolised as an eye.

Professor Sam Chang is also quoted as saying that the ‘alien’ parts of ‘junk’DNA produce ‘their own veins, arteries and immune system that vigorously resistsall our anti-cancer drugs’. The DNA implanted by the ‘extraterrestrials’ ispre-programmed, and one effect of the Saturn–Moon Matrix is to activate thoseprograms to play out as ‘spontaneous’ human behaviour and a sequence of ‘time’.The Matrix acts like a laser reading computer software or a DVD. It brings thepre-programmed information in human DNA onto the ‘screen’ – our decoded reality.The ‘software program’ is running in every human mind–body computer and it hasbeen encoded for aeons (Fig 155). Remember how Rebecca Cann, Assistant Professorof Genetics at the University of Hawaii, co-authored a study in the journal,Nature, saying that all modern humans are descended from a single mother wholived in Africa in about 200,000 BC. If what we call humans originate from asingle source the program could easily have been implanted that would infiltrateevery subsequent member of the ‘species’ (software). Only by becoming Consciousbeyond mind–body can we override the program. It has become so clear to me whilewriting this book that the extent of human behaviour programming is absolutelyfundamental. I understand from people who read papers by molecular biologist,Francis Crick, that he believed that DNA was preprogrammed. You will often hearit said that Crick and his associates ‘discovered DNA’; but what became known asdeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was first discovered by Johann Friedrich Miescher in1869. Crick, James Watson and Maurice Wilkins were given the Nobel Prize forPhysiology or Medicine in 1962 for ‘their discoveries concerning the molecularstructure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer inliving material’. Crick appears to have known far more about DNA than was madepublic, and he believed that it was of ‘extraterrestrial’ origin. So the Matrixillusion is so deep, so ingrained, because it is not only a Matrix field, but aDNA program. The ‘Queen Bee’ (Saturn–Moon) broadcasts the waveform information‘hack’ and humans decode this into a world they think they see, and perceptionsand behaviours that they think is ‘them’. We can be completely controlled by theMatrix and be no more than human robots responding to data input, or we can openour hearts and minds and see beyond what others can see. This means opening ourminds to Consciousness which is not subject to the manipulation of the Matrix orthe DNA program. It operates outside of ‘space’ and ‘time’ and beyond thevibrational walls of the Matrix. If you look at all the incredible and endlessinterconnected manipulations that I will describe in this book – and there areso many more – this clearly could not have been organised by people sittingaround a table deciding their next move. I have often pondered on this. How dothey do it? Was there a computer system spewing out data on what to do and when?But I can see it clearly now. Those in authority who run and enforce the humanControl System are following a program in the same way as worker ants and beesfollow the program broadcast by the Queen. They are computer terminals on theMatrix Internet with the Saturn–Moon Matrix triggering their already programmedDNA to respond according to program. The bloodlines are the most locked-inbecause they were genetically-created for that purpose, but anyone who is nottruly Conscious will be responding to their DNA Saturn–Moon Matrix program whichdrives their thoughts, perceptions and behaviour. How often are those inauthority described as ‘like robots’ that make decisions without logic orreason? ‘They’ are not making those decisions – the Matrix is (Fig 156). Thisscene in the first Matrix movie with Morpheus and Neo describes precisely thehuman plight when I add two words – Saturn and Moon:image [../Images/00183.jpg] Figure 155: Humans are held fast in the Saturn-Moon Matrix program when we arenot Conscious beyond mind-body Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00184.jpg] Figure 156: ‘Personal’ thoughts and perceptions? Or merely what people aredecoding? > The [Saturn–Moon] Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this> very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or you turn on your> television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when> you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to> blind you from the truth. > ‘What truth?’ > That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage …> born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your> mind. The Saturn–Moon Matrix is decoded within the electromagnetic frequency rangevisible to human sight and technology, and the genetic-engineering of the humanmind–body-computer locked humans into that frequency via DNA and the reptilianbrain. Consciousness can, however, override that and so they have to maintainhumanity in low-vibrational states to imprison their perception in the Matrix.The plasma field within our holographic reality acts like a plasma ‘screen’ onwhich we ‘watch’ the ‘picture show’, or appear to. It is an expression, likeeverything, of decoded waveform information. People go through their livesfollowing the Saturn program they are decoding while thinking this is the ‘realworld’ (Fig 157). Humans are like two-legged farm animals caught in theheadlights of an oncoming Matrix. The reality we are being fed is encoded withperceptions and experiences that cause people to transmit low-vibrationalemotional energy that both feeds the Reptilian Alliance and, in many ways, helpsto power the system. The virtual-reality ‘game’ is interactive, and so is thehacked version. We receive and transmit, we receive and ‘post’. The Saturn–MoonMatrix has created an energetic perception ‘loop’ in which the false reality isfed to us, and, when we perceive it and believe it, we feed back that perceptionto the Matrix. This constantly empowers the false reality in a feedback loop. Inshort, the Matrix is powered by our belief that the hacked reality is ‘real’. Wecan and will break this closed loop with the realisations that I am describingin this book, and by opening our minds to Consciousness beyond the Matrixfrequencies. The power of the Saturn–Moon Matrix to influence our realitydilutes and dilutes the more we open our minds and hearts and let Consciousnessin. The Control System is terrified of the Truth Vibrations for this reason, andthis is why it is now throwing everything that it can at humanity to keep usentrapped within the vibrational box through fear, chaos and upheaval. By theway, some unexplainable and ‘paranormal’ experiences happen when there is a‘glitch’ in the Matrix information field. As I write, there are many reportsfrom around the world that the heavens have changed, the constellations are notwhere they should be and that the Moon has changed its angle. This is the resultof the Reptilians manipulating the Matrix to confuse us and prepare us for thefake ‘end of the world’ or ‘new world’ prophecies by the Bible, the MayanCalendar, Hopi prophecies and all the rest. They are not true. They are part ofthe manipulation and the Reptilians plan to make it seem as if they arehappening by manufacturing events. They are already doing so. It was all planneda long ‘time’ ago. I’ll come to this in the final chapter.image [../Images/00185.jpg] Figure 157: The Saturn–Moon Matrix is how the Reptilians ‘gave us their mind’ Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00186.jpg] Figure 158: The Saturn–Moon Matrix and the Reptilian collective mind is theforce behind all the Illuminati institutions of government, banking, media,corporations, religion and Big Pharma ‘medicine’ and also programs the realityof their personnel Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00187.jpg] Figure 159: Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) REPTILIAN WORLDOne of the chief ways that the Matrix connects with us is, not surprisingly,through the reptilian brain, and this helps to lock us into the ReptilianAlliance control system (Fig 158). The Matrix transmissions are also aimed atour DNA receiver–transmitter systems, and much of this is happening within therealms of what science calls ‘junk DNA’. Some of this has been switched off inorder to narrow our band of experienced reality, and some is picking up theMatrix frequencies transmitted by carrier waves from Saturn via the Moon. Thisis how, in the words of Don Juan Matus in the Carlos Castaneda books, they ‘gaveus their mind’. It is worth reading that passage again in the light of what Ihave described: > We have a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos and took over the> rule of our lives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lord> and master. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it> suppresses our protest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we> don’t do so … indeed we are held prisoner! > They took us over because we are food to them, and they squeeze us mercilessly> because we are their sustenance. Just as we rear chickens in coops, the> predators rear us in human coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always> available to them. > Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictions> between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems> of belief, or the stupidity of his contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe> that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs, our ideas of good and> evil; our social mores. They are the ones who set up our dreams of success or> failure. They have given us covetousness, greed and cowardice. It is the> predator who makes us complacent, routinary and egomaniacal. > In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged> themselves in a stupendous manoeuvre – stupendous, of course, from the point> of view of a fighting strategist; a horrendous manoeuvre from the point of> those who suffer it. They gave us their mind. The predators’ mind is baroque,> contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any minute> now. The Saturn–Moon Matrix is how they have done it. Humans tuned most powerfully tothe Matrix transmissions (the overwhelming majority) are like worker antsfollowing the work-plan broadcast by the queen. Ants are said to communicatethrough chemicals called pheromones, but they are only the chemical expressionof vibrational communications. Ants tune in through their antennae and we pickup the Matrix broadcasts through DNA and the reptilian brain. The Reptilianshave a hive-mind communication system which the Matrix connects with, and itwould appear that at the centre of this is their version of a female ‘queen’.Maybe the worship of the ‘goddess’ is something to do with this and certainlythe hybrid bloodline is passed on through the mitochondrial, or female, DNA. TheIlluminati Reptilian hybrid bloodlines are the agents of the Matrix within theMatrix – the ‘Agent Smiths’ if you like, portrayed in the Matrix movie series.The Matrix ‘mind’ is the controlling force behind all the institutions of humancontrol and those who run and administer them while being unknowing prisoners ofthe Matrix themselves (Figure 159). I explained earlier how the reptilian braindoesn’t think – it reacts; it is constantly scanning the environment in searchof threats to its survival physically, financially and across the great spectrumof human experience – reputation, job, relationship, the list goes on and on.They need to feed us an endless stream of reasons to fear not surviving, toconnect us most powerfully into reptilian-brain reality – therefore Matrixreality (Fig 160). These emotional states affect the way DNA receives andtransmits, and cause heart rhythm incoherence that scrambles the relationshipbetween heart, brain and nervous system. This is another crucial reason why weare bombarded with wars, financial collapses, false-flag terrorist attacks,health ‘scares’, ‘global warming’, engineered ‘natural’ disasters and all mannerof other things. This way they can most powerfully plug us into the Matrix andenergise it through the ‘feedback’ loop (Fig 161).image [../Images/00188.jpg] Figure 160: The Saturn–Moon Matrix connects with the reptilian brain and thewhole genetic structure through DNA Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00189.jpg] Figure 161: The feedback loop. Programmed perceptions are fed back to the Matrixto empower those perceptions which are then fed back to humanity and so on Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com])BLOCKING FREQUENCIESMatrix-broadcasts and genetic manipulation also block us from perceiving thegreater reality. People who haven’t researched this would be amazed at whathuman scientists can do today, never mind those who are thousands of years aheadof them in technological know-how. I’ll also discuss a little later thetechnology that has existed for decades in human society that can externallyaccess the minds of people and feed them thoughts and commands that they believeare their own. It is a cinch when you know what you’re doing; and if humanscience can do this what can the scaly fellahs do? New Scientist, the mainstreamscience magazine, reported that when the United States switched from analogue todigital television, astronomers could suddenly see whole galaxies that weren’tpreviously visible. The race against time that the news item talks about herewas for astronomers to see as much as they could before the former analoguetelevision frequencies were sold off for other technology:image [../Images/00190.jpg] Figure 162: The Matrix blocks even more solar energy (information) than theEarth’s energy field would naturally do > Prior to the switch-over, naturally occurring radio waves at frequencies> between 700 and 800 megahertz were obscured by analogue TV signals preventing> astronomers from using this band. The freeing up of this bandwidth is a> once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see galaxies in this range. Astronomers could not see whole galaxies in that frequency range becauseAmericans were watching the television! Imagine what is possible with thetechnology the Reptilian Alliance is using. Earth’s charged plasma-field andatmosphere already blocks many energies and frequencies from getting through(Fig 162). I am only saying that other frequencies that we don’t know about arebeing artificially blocked. Human science has developed something called‘metamaterials’. Their ‘nano-metric surface’ interferes with light at specificwavelengths and this makes light (information) deviate around an object inspecific colours (frequencies) of the light spectrum. This makes the objectinvisible, because we only see something when light is reflected from it. Amainstream news report told how a team from Imperial College London, and SalfordUniversity in the North West of England, were exploiting this: > The scientists have conceived of a ‘space-time cloak’ which manipulates light> and, in essence, conceals whole events from a viewer. The theory is based on> censoring the flow of events, which we perceive as a stream of light> particles, also called photons, that strike the retina. By exploiting a> characteristic of fibre optics, the flow of photons can be slowed, events> edited out and stitched back together … > … [The team’s paper says] ‘A safecracker would be able, for a brief time, to> enter a scene, open the safe, remove its contents, close the door and exit the> scene, whilst the record of a surveillance camera apparently showed that the> safe door was closed all the time.’ This is what humans can do, and yet the far more technologically-advancedReptilian Alliance could not manipulate our reality in the way that I’m saying??I have been highlighting a movie for more than a decade for accuratelysymbolising what is really happening in the world. I can now see that it’s evencloser to the truth than I first thought after what I’ve discovered about theSaturn–Moon Matrix. The movie is called They Live, and it was released in 1988.I guess you would call it a sort of ‘B’–movie produced and directed by Americanfilmmaker, John Carpenter, who apparently also worked with George Lucas onspecial effects in the Star Wars series. Carpenter’s own movie-making careerthat includes science ‘fiction’, horror and occult themes confirms an awarenessof what is happening away from the public eye. They Live opens with a characterplayed by former wrestler, Roddy Piper, walking from city to city looking forwork in the building trade amid a catastrophic economic depression and policestate in America – the same that is happening now. He finds some temporary workon a building site, and at the end of the day he’s invited by a co-worker tostay in what today we would call a ‘tent city’. They had rigged up ablack-and-white communal television and suddenly the normal programming washacked into by a low-grade broadcast of a man saying that ‘They’ were here andthat ‘They’ were covertly controlling the population. The Roddy Piper characterbecomes suspicious about activity at a church across the road, and when hesneaks inside he realises that the choir music that he could hear outside was atape recording. He finds some brown boxes, but leaves before he can open one infear of being caught. That night the police raid the makeshift village withhelicopters and bulldozers. The place is razed and the people are attacked, andthey scattered. Piper returns the next day when all is quiet and goes into thechurch to see what is inside the boxes. He grabs one and runs into a back alley,and when he tears it open the contents are a pile of sunglasses. Bewildered anddisappointed, he takes one pair, puts them in his pocket, and walks out into themain street. But when he puts them on, everything changes. Advertisements on thebillboards are no longer displaying the images that he was seeing with his eyes.Now he can only see subliminal messages saying ‘stay asleep’, ‘do not questionauthority’, ‘obey’, ‘no independent thought’, ‘no imagination’, ‘consume’ and‘conform’ (Fig 163). He sees the same when he looks at the advertisements andarticles in magazines and newspapers. Money is imprinted with the message: ‘Thisis your God’ when he looks through the glasses.image [../Images/00191.jpg] Figure 163: Advertisements in They Live when the veil is lifted image [../Images/00192.jpg] Figure 164: The US President in They Live when viewed through the sunglasses image [../Images/00193.jpg] Figure 165: Beaming people to other planets in They Live His biggest shock, however, is when he sees that some people who look humanwithout the glasses look anything but human when he puts them on. The USPresident and the newsreaders on the television are not human. Some policeofficers are the same (Fig 164). He goes at one point into an area under thecity where he realises that there is a conspiracy between the hiddenextraterrestrials and a human cabal that serves their interest on the surface.People were being beamed to other planets with high technology that the publicdidn’t know existed (Fig 165). I have spoken with some that have worked onbeyond-top-secret projects and they have described being transported using ‘beamme up, Scotty’-type techniques. One said he had been beamed to a base under thesurface of Mars where he met members of an extraterrestrial race that lookedvirtually human. There is so much going on around us while the people areplaying ‘Moonopoly’ on the vibrational/holographic treadmill. The Roddy Pipercharacter discovers that people can’t see the non-humans controlling them or thesubliminal messages, because a frequency is being broadcast from a dish on atelevision tower that is blocking their ability to perceive them. The dish isdisabled, and suddenly people see extraterrestrials sitting next to them whenthe blocking frequency stops being broadcast. If you take that dish to be theMoon and the Saturn–Moon Matrix this is what is happening to us. Some ancienttraditions say this about the Moon in their own way. When Credo Mutwa read whatI have written about the Moon and the Moon Matrix in Human Race Get Off YourKnees, he said: ‘What you say about the Moon in your book is what our ancestorssaid was happening.’ He also told me that during one of his many ‘near deathexperiences’ he had looked at the Moon. ‘The Moon is exactly as what youdescribe,’ he said. ‘It has a big cave inside it. It is hollow as a football.Not real.’OTHER SOURCESI said earlier how often, when I have gone public with something that is ‘farout’ to mainstream society, that I will later get a sudden confirmation that Iam on the right track. I am not saying that every last detail is 100 per centaccurate, and I never have. There is such an endless mountain of information toprocess and fit together across so many diverse subjects, and there are forcestrying to block me from doing so. But the theme and most of the detail I am veryhappy with, although there is always more to know. You have to be open to thatat all times. I was sent an email about nine months after Human Race Get OffYour Knees was published. The writer said she had read the book and had seen theMoon information and she recommended that I check out a book called Earth byBarbara Marciniak. She included some page numbers. Barbara Marciniak is a‘channel’ who became well known in ‘New Age’ circles in the 1990s forcommunicating with an awareness that said it was connected to the cluster ofstars known as the Pleiades. The communications spoke of how a reptilian racewas manipulating humanity. I met Barbara a few times and liked her a lot. She isgrounded and not at all airy-fairy. I had read her book, Bringers of the Dawn,which was excellent, but I had not read Earth (Bear & Company; 1994). When itarrived in the post I went to the page numbers that the email had told me about… Well! This is what the book said was communicated through Barbara Marciniak: > … the Moon is a very powerful electromagnetic computer … The energy from the> Moon has been beaming electromagnetic frequencies onto the Earth for aeons now> to maintain the two-stranded DNA [it is said that it should be> twelve-stranded] … The Moon is a satellite that was constructed … it was …> anchored outside Earth’s atmosphere for aeons as a mediating and monitoring> device, a super computer or eye in the sky … > … Earth must be owned by those who dwell there; however it is not. You have> outside gods, creator energies, who prevent you, as a species, from having> free reign with your kundalini … The influence of the Moon, as a main> satellite computer, affects all of the Earth … The Moon’s programs have for> aeons been of great limitation toward human beings … There are repetitive> cycles that the Moon creates, to which you respond. The Moon creates Moonopoly. I had a good laugh when I read those passages ninemonths after I had decided to ‘jump’ with the Moon Matrix information.‘Computer’ moons like ours can also be used to influence planets in a veryloving and positive way and it is possible that the Moon was doing that beforeit was hijacked by the Reptilian Alliance to be a means of mass manipulation andcontrol. Barbara Marciniak’s channelling points this way and I am open to that.We need to be flexible about detail and let information be our guide, notunyielding dogma. In that case, removing the Reptilian Alliance from the Moonand changing what it broadcasts would have a life-changing effect on this planetand its inhabitants. Simply switching off the Reptilian broadcasts would changeeverything, too. Barbara’s channelling for her book indicates that othernon-human forces are in the process of intervening in the Reptilian control ofthe Moon and I have come across similar information. I understand all theseyears later that this intervention is significantly advanced. I would stronglyemphasise that we are not alone in meeting the challenges that we face – thebloodlines just want us to think we are. There is a multi-dimensional effortgoing on to set the planet free from aeons of Reptilian/Grey control and thiswill succeed. We need to play our part in our level of reality while others dotheir job elsewhere. This dismantling of the Reptilian Control System is notonly to help humanity. What is happening here is having a knock-on effect acrossa wide area of the galaxy and beyond because of how a smaller part of a hologramcan affect the whole. Barbara Marciniak’s channelling for Earth said: > There have been many battles over the Moon … There is a plan to gradually> insert different programs of influence on Earth when the Moon becomes occupied> by forces that would assist in your growth, rather than limit you. The Moon’s> programs have for eons been of great limitation toward human beings. The tales> about the full moon and insanity, madness and heightened bleeding are all> quite true. There are repetitive cycles that the Moon creates to which you> respond. > You know that television influences you to a great degree. The Moon is the> same way. You simply have not been able to tune into the Moon’s programs and> learn how to turn them off. You cannot. Others must turn the Moon off for you> or reprogram the Moon, which is taking place right now. At this time, the Moon> is quite controlled. Some people are gravely affected by mania and craziness> from the Moon. Extraterrestrials and others have many bases on the Moon, and> those from Earth have little influence when it comes down to it. > It is the extraterrestrials that really operate it all. Your technology,> though rapidly advancing, cannot begin to compare with the biotechnology> [including genetic engineering] of sentient space travellers. You are> newcomers to the game and you miss a vital key, for your senses, and the> essence of your physical world, structure reality in a particular way. You> constantly translate data and, like interpreting a dream, condense the> experience into physical boundaries, where you find you can explain less and> less. This is what I have been stressing all these years and throughout this book – weare being manipulated to decode reality in a way that keeps us limited andenslaved. I came across this quote, too, at about the same time from the famousArmenian-born mystic, George Gurdjieff. He said in 1916: > All movements, actions and manifestations of people, animals and plants depend> upon the Moon, and we are controlled by the Moon … The mechanical part of our> lives depends upon the Moon, is subject to the Moon. If we develop in> ourselves consciousness and will, and subject our mechanical self and all our> mechanical manifestations to them, we shall escape the power of the Moon. Precisely. The Saturn–Moon Matrix operates within the frequency range of mind,the electromagnetic spectrum and low-vibration emotion. When we open our mindsto Consciousness our perception expands beyond the influence of the Matrixfrequencies. We can suddenly perceive what we were blocked from perceiving andwe begin to see what is really going on. I was shown an article on the day I amwriting this that told the story of something called the ‘Chani Project’. Thiswas claimed to involve a secret technology located in Africa which made contactin 1994 with an entity from a parallel universe, and the communicationscontinued for the following five years. The article said that the entity wasasked more than 20,000 questions. ‘Chani’ is an acronym for ChannelledHolographic Access Network Interface. The entity was asked in one interactionwhat was the purpose of our Moon? It said that ‘life became better with no Moon’and that it was not a natural heavenly body. The Moon was there to control theEarth ‘mood’, it is quoted as saying. A ‘big calm’ would come over the peoplewithout the Moon, and there would be no ‘big storm’ – just a ‘little storm’.There would be peace among the people without the Moon. Funny how this ‘no-Moon’world is exactly how I am describing the Real Golden Age before ‘The Hack’. Thecommunication alluded to the fact that an ‘old race’ captured the Moon ‘fromspace’ and put it next to the Earth. This is what Zulu legends say, and what myown work supports. The Chani communications indicated that ‘Moon forces’operated like a time machine to control time and manipulated the mood of ‘beingson this planet in this timeline’. The most ancient human accounts do not mentiontime. It is an illusion of the Matrix, and time was encoded to enslave humans bydisconnecting us from the NOW. I can see very clearly as my understandingexpands that the ‘Time Loop’ is the Matrix. The Time Loop is what has beenhacked into the timeless NOW-reality that we should be experiencing. Saturn isassociated with time, and ‘Kronos’, the name of the Greek Saturn god, means‘time’. He is the symbol for Father Time. The two clocks on either side of themain entrance to St Peter’s Basilica in Rome are symbols of thisSaturn–Moon-control of our perception of time, and so is the clock-face ingeneral (Figs 166 and 167). You see the same clock theme at Westminster Abbeyand St Paul’s Cathedral in London, which are both Freemasonic temples designedby initiates of the bloodline cult. Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723) was thehigh initiate architect who designed St Paul’s Cathedral and also built theGreenwich Observatory in London through which runs the prime meridian of what iscalled Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Interestingly, the Chani ‘entity’ also talkedabout the ‘reptile’ holding humans back so they could not ‘grow’, and how theyhad won a ‘war’ with the reptiles in its own reality. ‘We kill many dragons [in]many timelines’, the communication said. The entity is reported to have addedthat humans had evolved more ‘spiritually’ than the reptiles that it was talkingabout, but the scaly guys ‘want to hold on to their wise technology … their godis their technology’. I have been saying this in my books for years. They arevery developed in their intellectual, technological mind, but they are not‘spiritually’ conscious. They have sought to make us the same by ‘giving ustheir mind’. The Moon has not always been there and some ancient legends say thesame. They tell of a time ‘before the Moon’. Ancient Greek authors, Aristotleand Plutarch, and Roman authors, Apollonius Rhodius and Ovid, told of a peoplecalled the Proselenes in Arcadia who said that their ancestors had been there‘before there was a moon in the heavens’. ‘Proselene’ means ‘before Selene’ –the Greek goddess of the Moon, and a name often used for the Moon itself. Romanwriter, Censorinus, also wrote of a time aeons ago when there was no Moon. DrHans Schindler Bellamy includes the same theme in his work, Moons, Myths andMen. He tells of the ‘Mozces’, a native tribe in Colombia that say they‘remember a time before the present Moon became the companion of the Earth’.Some Babylonian depictions of the Moon in the 11th century BC locate it betweenVenus and the Sun. I know that some people will say that the Moon always had tobe there or the Earth would be unstable and nothing like it is, but we are nottalking about the same planetary alignments we have now before the Moon came.The Solar System was very different to what we see today.image [../Images/00194.jpg] Figure 166: The clock face represents ‘Moon time’, or Saturn–Moon time, so youwould expect them to be prominent at the Vatican City as symbols of thetime-makers, Saturn and the Moon image [../Images/00195.jpg]Figure 167: Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00196.jpg] Figure 168: The cross and serpent-like symbol of Saturn along with the ancientcross and serpent symbol image [../Images/00197.jpg]Figure 169: SATURN–MOON CULTThese revelations explain the obsession with Saturn – the ‘Old Sun’, ‘Dark Sun’and ‘Dark Lord’. The ‘Lord God’, or merely ‘Lord’, in the Old Testament isSaturn and the Creation Myth in Genesis sounds very much like the creation ofthe Matrix –’And God said, ‘Let there be [visible] light,’ and there was light’.The Babylonian Nimrod was worshipped in Rome as the god ‘Saturn’, or ‘Saturnus’,and they celebrated his ‘birthday’ in the period running up to the laterChristian Christmas. This was the festival of Saturnalia and involved sacrifice,making and giving presents, decorating trees in the home and events ofcelebration spanning more than a week beginning on December 17th. Saturnalia hasmorphed into ‘Christmas’ – a festival to celebrate Saturn. ‘Santa’, as in‘Claus’, is an anagram of ‘Satan’ – Saturn. Worship of Saturn came to Rome, oncecalled the ‘City of Saturn’, from Mesopotamia where the Babylonians worshippedSaturn as ‘Nimrod’; and Christianity is just another version of the ‘Pagan’religion of Rome and Babylon. Everything fell into place once I realised that somany deities called ‘sun gods’ were actually symbols of the ‘Old Sun’, ‘DarkSun’ and ‘Dark Lord’ – Saturn. Christians are worshipping Saturn as their god tothis day without knowing it, and I’m sure that the deity, ‘Sol Invictus’,worshipped by Emperor Constantine, the founder of Christianity as we know it,was an Old Sun – Saturn deity. The ‘Christian’ cross can clearly be seen in theastrological sign for Saturn connected to a serpent-like image. Maybe there isan association here with the theme of the serpent on the cross (Figs 168 and169). The cult of Mithra, the Roman and Persian version of Jesus, was heavilyconnected to Saturn. The worship of Saturn dominated the ancient world and it isall around us today. The Roman god, Saturn, was known as ‘Cronus’ or ‘Kronos’ inGreece, the Titan father of Zeus (most of Saturn’s moons are named afterTitans). Saturn was Nimrod, or ‘Ninurta’, in Mespotamia and ‘Shani’ in the Hindureligion. The main Jewish holy day is named after Saturn – Saturday – and inIndia, Saturday is called ‘Shanivar’ after the Hindu Saturn god. Judaism isanother Saturn–Moon religion, and so is Islam. The most sacred place on Earthfor Muslims is the Kaaba located in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, within the world’sbiggest Mosque, the Masjid al-Haram. Islamic tradition says that the Kaaba wasbuilt by ‘Abraham’ who is also a hero to Judaism and Christianity. Abraham issaid to be the father of the Jews, the ‘Chosen Race’ of ‘god’ (Saturn), and theBible says that he came from the land of Shinar, or Sumer. The Kaaba is acube-shaped building (Kaaba means ‘cube’), and inside is a black stone thatIslam believes was taken there by Abraham. The Black Stone is allegedly part ofa meteorite that Islamic lore dates back to Adam and Eve – the time when thehuman race was being genetically hijacked by the Reptilians that control Saturnand the Moon. So the Kaaba is a cube? Hmmmmm. The cube is a symbol of … Saturn(Fig 170). Whenever you see the cube used as a religious or other esotericsymbol, it is representing Saturn. The cube is also a symbol of matter in alloccult traditions, and we can now see why. Saturn creates ‘matter’ as weperceive it through the information fields that we decode into holographicreality. A hexagon formation has been photographed by NASA at Saturn’s NorthPole, as we saw earlier, and a hexagon represents a three-dimensional cube. Whatdo we say about people who are enslaved in mind? They are in the box. Yes, theSaturn–Moon Matrix ‘box’. Muslims are supposed to kneel and face the directionof the Kaaba five times a day and ‘pray to Mecca’. The Five Pillars of Islaminsist that Muslims make the pilgrimage to the Kaaba at least once in theirlifetimes. The main pilgrimage is called the Hajj, and it pre-dates Islam.Pilgrims are told to walk around the Kaaba seven times and try to kiss the BlackStone on each circuit. They are also told to pray in concentric circles aroundthe Kaaba (Fig 171). Remind you of anything? The Hebrew Mishnah, or Mishna, thefirst written record of the ‘Oral Torah’, lists concentric circles of holinesssurrounding the Temple in Jerusalem, as you can see in Figure 172. Remind you ofanything? The ‘Holy of Holies’ to these religions is Saturn – the source,together with the Moon, of human control. Jews also wear the little cubed hat,the Tefillin, which is also a symbol of Saturn. We have the Jewish esoteric andmystical work, the Kabbalah – Kabb-Allah. This can be translated as ‘Cube-god’,or even ‘Saturn–Moon’ given that the Muslim Allah is a version of the moon god,Sin. The Christian’ cross can also be symbolised as an opened-out cube (Figure173) Now I realise as everything becomes so much clearer and simpler that thegod of Judaism, known as ‘El’, which I have linked to the Moon and Saturn inprevious books is, in fact, the representation of Saturn – hence Is-Ra-El. Thisis Isis, the virgin mother of Egypt; Ra, the sun god of Egypt; and El, theHebrew god of Saturn. El refers to a universal god and was called the ‘father ofthe gods’ and ‘father of man’ – the ‘father’ of the genetically-engineered,re-wired human that we know today. El comes from El-ohim, mentioned 2,500 timesin the Old Testament – the Reptilian Alliance. We have ‘angEls’ called Micha-EL,Gabri-EL, Uri-EL and Rapha-EL. The Bible talks about Jesus as Emmanu-EL and wehave the Gosp-EL, and church EL-ders. We also have the ancient and Freemasonicsymbol of the ob-ELisk.image [../Images/00198.jpg] Figure 170: The Kaaba cube – a symbol of Saturn image [../Images/00199.jpg] Figure 171: Now we can see why Muslim ‘pilgrims’ are told to pray at the Kaabastone in concentric circles. So funny image [../Images/00200.jpg] Figure 172: The Jewish ‘Holy of Holies’ – Saturn image [../Images/00201.jpg] Figure 173: Cube and Cross The symbolism of Saturn is everywhere – not only in religion. You see thesymbolism and worship of the ‘Lord of the Rings’ throughout the Illuminatibloodline system. Saturn is represented by the colour black and known to theancients and today’s secret societies and Satanists as the ‘Black Sun’. This iswhy the Kaaba is black and why you have the black robes of judges, barristers,priests, rabbis and also students when they ‘graduate’ (confirm their degree ofindoctrination) wearing a square hat, or ‘mortarboard’ (Fig 174). The leader ofthe Saturn-worshipping Jesuit Order is rightly known as the ‘Black Pope’.Illuminati bloodlines that came out of Italy, especially Florence and Venice,are known as the Black Nobility. The Saturn–Moon Matrix seeks to close the humanthird-eye to enslave us in five-sense reality. The third-eye chakra resonates tothe colour blue, and the Illuminati, in the words of the Rolling Stones song,want to ‘paint it black’. They have done so with most people, but it ischanging. Saturn is the god of banking, which won’t surprise anyone by now, andwe have Elections to be El-ected. If you become rich and powerful you join theEl-ite. The Saturn–Moon Matrix is casting a sp-El on the human mind. Communismwas a creation of the El-ite, as I have revealed in detail in books like … Andthe Truth Shall Set You Free. You can see in Figure 175 how the astrologicalsymbol for Saturn was incorporated as the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union.A black-robed judge has a hammer, and the ‘Grim Reaper’, a Saturn-inspiredimage, is represented as an evil figure with a scythe. Saturn was symbolised bythe ancients as a six-pointed star – the symbol of the House of Rothschild whichthey incorporated into the flag of modern IS-RA-EL (Fig 176). The very name‘Rothschild’ comes from the German words meaning ‘red shield’ or ‘red sign’ –the six-pointed star of Saturn displayed on the original Rothschild house inGermany. Saturn is the sixth ‘planet’ from the Sun and the sixth day of theweek. Also remember that six-sided Hexagon at Saturn’s north pole. The Biblesays that the number of the Beast is 666. Rings are obvious symbols of Saturn,not least wedding rings. Matrimony is about restriction and tradition throughthe ‘institution’ (Saturn) of marriage when you look at it from the widerperspective. I now realise that the halo, or ring, around the heads of religiousdeities and heroes is a symbol not of our Sun, but the ‘Old Sun’ – Saturn. Satanis Saturn and so Satanism is Saturnism. Satanists wear black because they areworshippers of Saturn and the non-human entities that control that brown dwarfcontrol system and orchestrate the enslavement of humanity. Satanists alsoworship the Moon because of its connection to Saturn, and the same demonicReptilian ‘gods’. The other main Satanic colour is red, and the most famous ‘manin red’ is Father Christmas (Santa/Satan) who ‘arrives’ on his ‘sleigh’ aroundthe time of the Roman festival of Saturnalia. Black and red were wellrepresented inside the Death Star (moon) with Darth Vadar, a classic symbol ofSaturn, in the Star Wars films. The symbolism is everywhere (Fig 177). Saturn’sastrological sign is Capricorn, the goat, and so we have the goat god, Pan, andthe goat image widely used in Satanism. The goat theme can be seen with theclassic composite representation of the ‘evil one’ known as Baphomet (Fig 178).This is the image worshipped by the Knights Templar, and that is a given when,like the Jesuits, Knights of Malta and Opus Dei, they are an arm of the Saturncult called the Roman Church. Pope Benedict XVI, a former member of Nazi Youth,loves wearing his Saturn hat (Fig 179). The symbol of Saturnian Capricorn is thegoat combined with a fish – another symbol of the Reptilians as ‘fish gods’.Saturn is the god worshipped by the Illuminati bloodline secret-society network.Some do this openly, as with the Fraternitas Saturni, or Brotherhood of Saturn,in the major occult centre and birthplace of the House of Rothschild, Germany.The black squares on the Freemasonic floor (Freemasons are said to be ‘on thesquare’) and in many churches and cathedrals symbolise Saturn. So does thesquare black mortarboard in academia at University. The same is true of thesquares on a chessboard and the symbol of the Freemasonic compass with its sixpoints. Saturn is represented in numerology by the number eight and so theeight-legged spider is used as a Saturn symbol and St Peter’s Square in Rome isbroken up into eight segments around the original Egyptian obelisk.image [../Images/00202.jpg] Figure 174: The black robes of Saturn in religion, ‘education’ and the law. image [../Images/00203.jpg] image [../Images/00204.jpg]Figure 175: The Saturn symbol again in the symbol of Rothschild Zionist-createdSoviet Communism image [../Images/00205.jpg] Figure 176: The six-pointed star of the Rothschilds – the symbol of Saturn – onthe flag of Rothschild-controlled Israel image [../Images/00206.jpg] Figure 177: Saturn symbolism can be seen throughout global society Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) image [../Images/00207.jpg] Figure 178: The Saturn ‘goat’ as Baphomet image [../Images/00208.jpg] Figure 179: The present Pope and others in the headgear known as the ‘SaturnHat’ image [../Images/00209.jpg] Figure 180: The symbol of the Skull and Bones Society SATURN IN THE STARSAstrology is part of the Saturnian picture. This does have a scientific basiswhen practised properly and it does reveal the energetic influences to which weare subjected – but only in the Matrix. What must be stressed and stressed againis that we do not have to be prisoners of those influences. Consciousness canovercome all of it and go its own way. Astrology also underpins the illusion oftime – a basic foundation of the Saturn Conspiracy. Beyond thisSaturn–Moon-generated reality none of this stuff exists. The representation ofSaturn in astrology fits the bill perfectly. Saturn is the planet (sun) ofdeath, restriction, authority, control, obedience, poverty, fear and time. Itrules the bones of the body and so you have the skull-and-bones as a majorsymbol of the Saturn-controlled Illuminati. The Skull and Bones Society isreally the Saturn Society (Fig 180). Saturn is the astrological ruler ofinstitutions, corporations, figures in authority, scientists and old people. Itrepresents laws, rules, regulations and ‘tradition’ (repeating ritual). Saturnis non-emotive and represents limitation, austerity, discipline and depression.The term ‘Saturnine’, meaning to have a gloomy, taciturn temperament, has anancient origin related to the influence of Saturn. What am I describing here?The very world we live in, and ever more so. I am describing the way that humansociety has been constructed; the way secret societies operate with all theirrules, rituals and hierarchy; and all the pomp and ritual surrounding theBritish Royal Family and their kind. Planet Earth is a Saturnian societycontrolled from Saturn via the Moon and the Illuminati hybrid bloodlines. Thismakes so much sense of what has happened to the world, and what is happening.Notice how the traits and influences of the Saturnian are the same as theDraconian – the Reptilian ‘hive’ mind. The Saturn–Moon Matrix reflects the hivemind of the Reptilians that control Saturn and the Moon. Now you have seen theastrological and Matrix effects of Saturn, look again at that quote from earlierdescribing the human reptilian brain:image [../Images/00210.jpg] Figure 181: The Saturn–Moon–Earth structure of human control and suppression Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) > At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain. Without> defining them, I shall simply say that in human activities they find> expression in: obsessive compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals and> superstitious acts; slavish conformance to old ways of doing things;> ceremonial re-enactments; obeisance to precedent, as in legal, religious,> cultural, and other matters and all manner of deceptions. The Saturnian and the Reptilian are expressions of each other – ‘They gave ustheir mind’. Now read again what I wrote earlier about the ‘personality’ of theleft hemisphere of the brain: > The left-brain is ‘logical and rational’ in its definition of logical and> rational. It decodes information in the NOW into a sequence. This is basically> where ‘time’ comes from. The quicker the left-brain ‘moves’ this sequence the> faster time seems to pass and vice versa. It is ‘analytical and objective’,> which often means that if I can’t see it, hear it, touch it, taste it or smell> it, it can’t exist. > Crucially, it decodes reality in parts rather than as a whole. It is from the> left-brain that we get the perception of everything being apart from> everything else with ‘space’ in between. It creates structures – loves ‘em –> and it is through the left-brain that we produce language. I have just> described the world as it is currently ‘lived’. > … The left-brain sees individual dots, but the right-brain can see how they> fit together. Left-brain-dominated people control science, academia, medicine,> politics, big business, religion, the media and the military. These, in turn,> act as the soldiers at the gate to the collective left-brain to keep> right-brain reality at bay. Saturn, reptilian genetics and the way the left side of the brain decodesreality are peas from the same pod. This, then, is what we are dealing with:Saturn is hacking into the information construct communicated via the Sun andcreating a fake reality, amplified to the Earth by the Moon, which is associatedwith deception in the Tarot. We decode this ‘hack’ and believe it to be ‘real’.The force behind this, the Reptilian Alliance, controls a pyramid structurewithin visible light (the hack) via its hybrid bloodlines of the Illuminati (Fig181). This structure created and controls religion (Saturn religions); banking(astrologically ruled by Saturn); politics and the institutions of State at alllevels (astrologically ruled by Saturn); corporations (astrologically ruled bySaturn); the law and the court system (astrologically ruled by Saturn); science(astrologically ruled by Saturn); on and on it goes. Saturn-worship is endemicthroughout human society even in annual festivals like Christmas.So now we have a fix on what is ‘going on’ from deep, deep within the rabbithole – deeper than anyone has yet gone. Our plight seems hopeless. But, itisn’t. The door to Freedom is about to open. It is opening if you know what tolook for. I’ll come to that later, but first I’ll explain how all this impactsupon daily life."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00211.jpg] I could have called this chapter ‘Reptilian World’, ‘Left-Brain World’ or, as itis, ‘Saturn World’. They all describe the mentality that has manipulated andcontrolled Planet Earth for aeons.This has been done through a control-structure broadcast from Saturn via theMoon to entrap human perception of self and reality. The Illuminati hybridbloodlines, the Saturn–Moon–Reptilian operatives within visible light, have beenembarked on a continual process of centralising power for thousands of years.There are so few controllers compared with humans that centralisation of poweris crucial to their plans. The more you centralise power, the more power the fewhave over the many; and the more power you gather at the centre, the more poweryou have to centralise even quicker. People once lived in small groups called‘tribes’, and they decided among themselves what would and would not happen.Then the tribes were brought together to form ‘nations’, and now the few at thecentre of the ‘nation’ were dictating to all the former tribes. We are todaywell into the next stage, especially in Europe/Europa, of grouping the nationstogether to allow a few at the centre to dictate and impose their will – theReptilian Alliance will – upon large numbers of nation states. We already havethe European Union and the African Union, and the plan is for a North AmericanUnion of the United States, Canada and Mexico, leading to a Union of theAmericas. They are planning similar groupings all over the world controlled bydark-suit dictators, appointed, not even El-ected, as with the EuropeanCommission today. They are seeking to impose a world government to dictate tothese unions which would dictate to the nations, or rather regions of the formernations (Fig 182 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos585174]). Their goal is todivide nation states into regions to dilute any resistance to the edifice ofpower that I am describing. Maps have been made public that reveal how theEuropean Union plans to regionalise Europe by grouping regions of one countrywith regions of others (Fig 183 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos590062]).Goodbye, nation state. And they want to do the same everywhere. The worldgovernment is planned to impose its will through a world army and to dictate allglobal finance through a world central bank and a global electronic currency.The plan to destroy the nation state includes opening borders to massiveimmigration to replace a defined culture and national identity to make it harderto defend the concept of the nation state. The whole structure, or ‘New WorldOrder’, would be founded on an Orwellian – and then some – global surveillancestate with everybody microchipped and connected to a global tracking system24/7. If anyone thinks that this is some fantasy, well think again. Even better,know again, because it’s happening. Centralisation of global power in all areasof our lives has long reached the point where it has been given a name –‘globalisation’. This is the very global fascist/communist agenda that I havebeen exposing and warning about since the early 1990s. What I have been writingabout in my books all these years is now playing out on the television news. Ilove it when ‘journalists’ have said to me, ‘That would never happen’, when itbloody is happening all around them. There are none so blind as those who do notwish to see."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00212.jpg] Figure 182: The structure of global control that the bloodlines are workingtowards. It is highly likely that they have other ‘unions’ in mind, too,including a Middle East Union The code words and stepping stones are already there to be seen. Constantreferences to the ‘International Community’ and the ‘will’ of the InternationalCommunity are codes for ‘world government in the making’. The same is true ofthe endless summits of ‘G8’, ‘G20’ and all the rest, and the constant spoutingon about ‘International Law’. What does a world government need in order togovern? Laws that everyone has to obey: International Law. The United Nationswas created by the bloodlines and established on land donated by the Rockefellerfamily in New York. The UN was created as a stalking horse and a stepping stonefor world government after their first effort, the League of Nations, failed tosurvive. Look what happened with Libya. The ‘International Community’ – theUnited States, Britain and France in this case – decide that they want rid ofColonel Gaddafi and they send the boys in – the de facto world army called NATO.The ‘International Community’ is dominated by the United States, Britain andIsrael. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said that Italy only joined thebombing of Libya because of pressure from the United States. I wrote in themid-1990s in my book … And the Truth Shall Set You Free that we should watch forNATO becoming involved in conflicts outside the North Atlantic region that itwas created to defend (according to the official story). I said that this wouldbe the way it would expand its operation on the road to becoming the World Armywith the United Nations’ ‘peacekeeping’ structure and other military groupingsthrown in. NATO is now in Afghanistan and spent the summer of 2011 bombingcivilians in Libya in order to ‘protect them’. This drip, drip to a world armywas the reason that very soon after America, Britain and France began bombingLibya they handed the operation over to NATO control. This set anotherprecedent. The El-ite are already calling for a world central bank to ‘solve’the economic crisis they purposely created to justify a total re-structure ofglobal finance based on … a world central bank. Cash is going out of circulationat an ever-increasing rate as electronic ‘money’ takes over in line with theplan for a single electronic currency. The deletion of basic freedoms, ever moreinvasive laws and surveillance, and the imposition of the police state are beingrolled out at an ever-quickening pace. You want to fly? Okay, do you want youand your children to be irradiated or sexually molested? Don’t tell me thatpeople don’t have a choice. European Union bureaucrats are dictating the finedetail of people’s lives right across the continent even down to what lightbulbsthey can and cannot use. Conspiracy researchers like me have been saying formany years that the plan was to fuse the United States, Canada and Mexico intothe North American Union, but government spokespeople and the patheticin-the-back-pocket mainstream media have said it was just a ‘conspiracy theory’.This is despite all the evidence to support what is being said. CNN anchor, LouDobbs, was sacked when, among other related issues, he insisted on highlightingthe conspiracy to impose the North American Union. While I was writing thisbook, an American diplomatic cable from 2005 was made public through theWikiLeaks website which confirmed the covert plan for the North American Union,or what it called the ‘North American Initiative’. The idea all along has beento use America to destroy America (Fig 184[../Text/index_split_030.html#filepos590455]). They have been using America’s(borrowed) money and its vast military to impose the agenda of the Reptilianhybrid El-ite, but in doing so the plan has been to bring America to its knees.This is what has happened with the United States now drowning in staggeringmountains of debt. You cannot have a world government dictatorship and also have‘superpowers’ that have the financial and military might to say no to you.America had to be crippled so it could be absorbed into the new world systemthat would give the Reptilians and their hybrids total control – far beyond evenwhat Orwell envisaged.image [../Images/00213.jpg] Figure 183: A European Union map that divides Europe into regions, with regionsfrom one country joined with those from other countries "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00214.jpg] Figure 184: The United States is being systematically destroyed to bring itunder the heel of the world dictatorship Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) HOLOGRAPHIC TYRANNYIt is important to emphasise here that the American military is not, well, theAmerican military. It is the global El-ite’s military, the Reptilian Alliance’smilitary. We go back to the structure I mentioned earlier, the holographic‘Blueprint’. The operational centre of the web in Europe (and Israel) dictatesthe global agenda to its subsidiary networks of bloodline families and secretsocieties in each country. The United States has been a kind of jewel in thecrown as the major subsidiary since it was established following the war withthe British and the Declaration of Independence in 1776. But it wasn’t‘independence’. It was control in another form, as I have explained. Thegovernmental, political, financial, corporate and media networks in the UnitedStates are controlled by bloodline families like the Rockefellers, and others,who answer to families above them in the hierarchy, especially the Rothschildsin Europe. American troops do not go to war for American people; they go to warfor the Reptilian hybrids. This is also the case with Britain, France, Italy,Australia – virtually everywhere. It is appropriate that people speak of the‘theatre’ of war. This is what war is: a deadly, merciless stage-show that israrely, if ever, fought for the reasons that we are given. NATO planes weresupposed to be in Libya to ‘protect civilians’, but immediately started killingthem from the air after NATO said that they would attack anyone harmingcivilians (NATO should have bombed itself then). They even killed members of theLibyan ‘opposition’ that they claimed to be ‘supporting’. It’s all a movie, forpublic consumption only. Wars and bombing in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan,ad infinitum, are part of a long-planned agenda to impose a centralisedfascist/communist global tyranny (I put those words together, by the way,because they are essentially names for the same thing). We see the troops,planes and explosions on the television news and we see the gofers and front-menand women called ‘politicians’ selling the reasons why the war must happen witha constant stream of lies; but we don’t see the bloodline hybrids and theirsecret-society network dictating events from the background, and certainly notthe Reptilian Alliance that controls them (Fig 185[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos594173]). So-called ‘world leaders’ such asObama in the United States, Cameron in Britain, Sarkozy in France, Harper inCanada and Gillard in Australia are only there to serve their hidden masters byselling the bloodline agenda, signing the legislation and declaring war. Theblueprint for political ‘leaders’ can be seen with Barack Obama, David Cameronand Tony Blair. They are just slick used-car salesmen from whom anyone withintelligence would not purchase a skateboard."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00215.jpg] Figure 185: ‘Leaders’ that we see in the apparent positions of power are neverthe ones really in charge – those in the shadows are This Saturnian structure can be symbolised as a transnational corporation, aspider’s web or a pyramid (Fig 186[../Text/index_split_032.html#filepos598406]). In fact, smaller pyramids insidebigger pyramids until the whole lot are encased by the biggest pyramid – theRussian-doll principle. Virtually every organisation, be it a government, bank,business, university, or media operation, is structured as a pyramid. You havethe few at the top, at the ‘capstone’, who know what is really going on; but asyou go further down the pyramid there are more and more people knowing less andless about the true aims and ambitions of the organisation. They only know whatthey need to know to make their contribution to the unfolding tyranny whilehaving no clue – most of them anyway – that they are doing so. They, after all,also have to live in the world that is being imposed and so, too, do theirchildren and grandchildren. The only people who know how all the individualcontributions throughout the pyramid fit together to secure a very sinisteroutcome are the few at the top. This is how knowledge of the conspiracy iscensored by what is called ‘compartmentalisation’ of information. Most of thepeople in the British government at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 hadno idea why that really happened, or what hidden forces were at work. Knowledgewas compartmentalised in a small group – around Illuminati asset, Tony Blair –which answered to those in the shadows. Most members of the Blair cabinet, thesupposed ‘government’, were irrelevant. The ‘individual’ pyramids of government,banking, corporation, media outlets, and so on, are encompassed by a biggerpyramid which is controlled from the capstone by the bloodline families. These,too, have a pyramidal hierarchy among the 13 leading families (Fig 187[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos598859]). It’s all hierarchy. We aretalking about reptilian genetics (software) after all which has ‘a desire forsocial hierarchies’. There are pyramids that encompass the banking system – ‘BigBanking’ – and also Big Government, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Biotech, Big Media,etc. All of them are ‘capstoned’ by the bloodline families, and in this way theycan unleash their agenda for constant centralisation of power through all ofthem. Those who appear to run the system – presidents, prime ministers, heads ofNATO, the World Bank, IMF and their like, are nowhere near the top of thepyramid. They are the here-today-gone-tomorrow gofers who answer to those abovethem where the power really is (Fig 188[../Text/index_split_034.html#filepos599343]). The bloodline Hidden Hand selectsthe ‘El-ected’ leaders by controlling any political party (pyramids again) thathas any chance of forming a government (Fig 189[../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos599793]). There are essentially four typesof ‘leader’: (1) Those who know what is happening and what they are workingtowards (the few); (2) People who are desperate for ‘power’ for power’s sake andwill do and say anything to get it; (3) Those with big secrets to hide throughwhich they can be blackmailed into doing what they are told to do; (4) Idiotswho are easily manipulated by ‘advisors’ and public ‘servants’. Every time I seethe words ‘idiot’ and ‘leader’ in close proximity I automatically get a picturein my mind of Brian Cowen, the Irish Prime Minister who devastated the Irisheconomy for generations with ‘his’ bank bailout using the nation’s borrowedmoney. I can’t think why, but it always happens."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00216.jpg] Figure 186: The bloodlines hoard advanced knowledge at the peak of the globalpyramid and keep the public in ignorance of what they need to know to understandhow they are controlled and directed "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00217.jpg] Figure 187: The pyramid-within-pyramid ‘Russian doll’ structure in which thebloodline families sit at the top of all the pyramids and direct the same agendafor centralisation of power throughout all of them --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00218.jpg] Figure 188: The people who appear to be in power are nowhere near the top of thepyramid.

This is the series of satellite organisationsanswering to a secret society known as the ‘Round Table’ which was establishedin London in the late 19th century (Fig 190[../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos605444]). Cecil Rhodes, a Rothschild agent,was its first leader. The Round Table spawned the London ‘think tank’, the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs, in 1920. A year later came the Council onForeign Relations (CFR), a ‘think tank’ created to manipulate US foreign policy.The CFR was seriously involved in establishing the Rothschild–Rockefeller UnitedNations as a major stepping-stone to world government. The American delegationat the founding conference of the UN was like a roll call of CFR members. Thehighly-secretive Bilderberg Group came next in 1954, and this acts as acoordinating force to ensure that a common policy (the bloodlines’ policy) isfollowed by politicians, bankers, corporations, Intelligence personnel, themilitary and the media in multiple countries. The Bilderberg group was chairedfor a long time by the German-born Nazi supporter who later became PrinceBernhard of the Netherlands. Bilderberg meetings are attended by members ofEuropean royalty, including Bernhard’s daughter, Queen Beatrix. They also bringtogether bankers from multiple countries, and the heads of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), national central banks, the World Trade Organization andNATO. These are joined by major political leaders, and future ones, too. BillClinton, the then little-known governor of Arkansas, attended the Bilderbergmeeting in 1991 and was elected President of the United States the followingyear. Tony Blair was invited to the meeting in 1993 and became leader of theBritish Labour Party the following year, and later Prime Minister for ten yearsthanks to the support of the bloodline media empire of Rupert Murdoch. Clintonand Blair went to war together, coordinated by the Hidden Hand. Barack Obama andHillary Clinton both slipped quietly into the Bilderberg meeting at theWestfields Marriott Hotel in Chantilly, Northern Virginia, during their electioncampaign of 2008. Independent real journalists have been able to predict throughcontacts attending Bilderberg meetings that the invasion of Iraq would happen inMarch 2003, and that the housing ‘bubble’ was going to be burst to trigger abanking crisis. Prominent Bilderberg players over decades have been DavidRockefeller, who attended the first meeting at the Bilderberg Hotel in theNetherlands in 1954 (Fig 191 [../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos605743]);Rothschild/Rockefeller agent, Henry Kissinger; and Obama mentor, ZbigniewBrzezinski, former National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter. I havelisted as an appendix the attendees at the 2011 Bilderberg meeting in St Moritz,Switzerland, to give you a feel for the kind of people and organisations who arerepresented. They included Rothschild frontmen in the UK, Chancellor of theExchequer, George Osborne, and Labour Party Machiavelli and Rothschildbag-carrier, Peter Mandelson – a man rightly known as the ‘Prince of Darkness’.Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller were there, as always, along with peoplelike Peter Orszag, Obama’s first Budget Director, and Robert E Rubin,Co-Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations and one of the architects of thefinancial crash of 2008. Representing the Internet – for which the bloodlineshave some dastardly plans – were Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google, andJeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com [http://amazon.com]. There werebankers and financial people galore, as usual, including Franco Bernabè, vicechairman of Rothschild Europe. The Round Table’s ‘Club of Rome’ was formed in1968 to exploit environmental issues to justify the Reptilian agenda, and thishas been a major source of the outrageous lie called ‘human-caused globalwarming’, or ‘climate change’ as it became after temperatures fell year afteryear. The American-based Trilateral Commission was established in 1973 byco-founders David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski. This is anothercoordinator and manipulator of policy worldwide. All these Round Tablesatellites are interconnecting secret societies at their inner core and thisnetwork is part of the greater web, or pyramid, as are the World Bank, theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and theWorld Health Organization (WHO). These are all agencies of the planned worldgovernment and they were established by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds throughtheir puppet politicians.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00220.jpg] Figure 190: The Round Table network --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00221.jpg] Figure 191: David Rockefeller: Looks what he is The World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization are part of theeffort to control various global subject areas from one building, or around onetable. The idea is to have governments ‘sign up’ to be members and committhemselves to doing what these dark-suits tell them to do in terms of trade,health and other policy. The World Trade Organization has the power to imposemassive fines on countries that seek to protect their economies and people fromthe merciless world system. The strategy is to make every country and communitydependent on other countries and communities over which they have no control.The only people who can direct the system are the bloodline families with theirsubsidiaries in every country. ‘Free trade’ is nothing to do with ‘freedom’; itis about exploitation. The bloodline version of ‘free trade’ allows theircorporations to savagely exploit some of the poorest people in the world,working them till they drop and paying them a pittance. This means that theirproducts are made for a fraction of the price that they will sell them for inricher parts of the world. This becomes even more profitable as ‘trade barriers’come down along with trade tariffs. Both groups of people, at the production endand at the buying end of this ‘free trade’ scam, are coldly exploited. But thenthe bloodlines ‘do’ cold better than anyone. The World Health Organizationorders that populations be vaccinated, as with the farce over ‘swine flu’, andgovernments then give billions to Big Pharma to mass vaccinate the people.‘Swine flu’ never affected a single pig. How strange. Well, not really; it wasjust another lie. Thirty million people were given the ‘swine flu’ vaccine,Pandemrix, before the European Medicine Agency warned that it should not begiven to anyone under 20 because it increased the risk of developing narcolepsy,which makes people fall asleep unexpectedly. How many others suffered healtheffects after having ‘swine flu’ vaccine for ‘protection’ against a non-existentdisease? We now have the Rothschilds and the Rockefeller families dictatingglobal trade policy through the World Trade Organization, and health policythrough the World Health Organization. Indeed, it was John D Rockefeller, theoil tycoon and Rothschild subordinate in the United States, who imposed ‘modern’scalpel and drug ‘medicine’ on the world while being treated himself by apersonal homoeopath until the day he died, aged 97. Ever notice how so many ofthese people live to a great age compared with most of the human population? TheQueen Mother in Britain lived until she was 102; and, at the time of writing,the Queen is 85; the Duke of Edinburgh is 90; Father George Bush is 87; HenryKissinger is 88; and David Rockefeller is 96. How come? One reason is they don’thave the same medical treatment that they impose on the rest of the population.Those who wish to use alternative treatments and supplements are facing evermore challenges as the bloodlines target alternative practitioners to put themout of business, or ‘license’ them into ineffectiveness, and introduceregulations to prevent people having food supplements and alternative remedies.The deeply corrupt Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States saysthat it plans to, in effect, censor medical and health ‘apps’ on mobile phoneswhen they don’t conform to its (official) version of how people should betreated. A major vehicle for the war on alternative medicine is CodexAlimentarius (Latin for ‘Food Code’ or ‘Food Book’), which is seeking‘harmonisation’ of global food and supplement laws and regulations. At leastthat is the cover story. The real reason is to deny supplements and decent foodto those awake enough to see that they and their families are beingsystematically poisoned by Big Pharma, Big Biotech and Big Food.Genetically-modified food, courtesy of Monsanto, one of the most activebloodline corporations on the planet, is designed to genetically modify humans.The World Trade Organization (Rothschild/Rockefeller) has agreed to recognisethe rules and regulations decided by Codex Alimentarius(Rothschild/Rockefeller). Really? I’m shocked. So who were the nice people thatstarted this Codex deal in the 1960s? Well, well – only Nazi war criminalsjailed at the Nuremberg Trials for crimes against humanity. People like HermannSchmitz, president of the Nazi chemical giant, IG Farben; and IG Farbenexecutive, Fritz ter Meer. IG Farben ran the concentration camp at Auschwitz,where the camp doctor was ‘Angel of Death’, Joseph Mengele; and Fritz ter Meerwas responsible for the ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ (‘Work Makes Free’) sign over theAuschwitz main gate. He was jailed for seven years for war crimes at Nuremberg,but only served four after the intervention of his great friend, NelsonRockefeller, the four-times Mayor of New York. Why would a Rockefeller help aNazi? Because he was a Nazi, too. They’re all Nazis if we are talking abouttheir attitudes to humanity. Read some of my other books, such as … And theTruth Shall Set You Free, and you’ll see how the Rockefeller, Bush and Harrimanfamilies, among many others in the United States, funded the Nazis in the run-upto the war. There are no ‘sides’ with the Reptilian bloodlines, only means to anend. Nelson Rockefeller was part of the government–Intelligence cabal thatbrought Nazis like Mengele to the United States after the war to continue theirunspeakable mind and genetic torture of American children and adults, and thenheaded the Rockefeller Commission that covered up the true scale and horror ofwhat was done – and is still being done. Incidentally, talking of the Harrimanfamily, Brown Brothers Harriman, America’s oldest and largest private bank, hasbeen a highly significant player in the bloodline agenda since it was formed in1818 through people like railway tycoon, E Roland Harriman, Averell Harriman(the Henry Kissinger of his day) and Prescott Bush, grandfather of Boy Bush.There is a large symbol today outside the Brown Brothers Harriman building closeto Wall Street. It is a very large cube (Fig 192[../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos612802]). I can’t think why."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00222.jpg] Figure 192: The Saturn symbol outside Brown Brothers Harriman in New York WHAT IS THE POINT IN VOTING?The American example is perfect for showing how the party political systemoperates in countries throughout the world. There are two parties in the UnitedStates that have any chance of forming a government: Republicans and Democrats.But these are two masks on the same face; two wings on the same plane. Thismeans that no matter who gets Elected, the same hidden force is always in powerand the same plan continues to advance on the road to complete global tyranny.America is an even more potent example because the apparently immensedifferences between Boy George Bush (‘Republican’) and Barack Obama (‘Democrat’)have turned out be nothing of the kind. The Republican Party during the eightyears of Bush was controlled by a network called the ‘neocons’, orneo-conservatives. The term ‘con’ would be far more accurate in anotherdefinition. The neocons were dominated by members of the Rothschild secretsociety (of which much more later) that I call Rothschild Zionism. I always addthe word ‘Rothschild’ to constantly highlight the creators and controllers ofZionism. The neocons included people like Richard Perle (Rothschild Zionist), apolitical advisor and lobbyist; Paul Wolfowitz (Rothschild Zionist), US DeputyDefense Secretary at the time of 9/11; and William Kristol (Rothschild Zionist),editor of the Washington D.C.-based propaganda sheet called The Weekly Standard.This was owned for a long time by El-ite media tycoon, Rupert Murdoch(Rothschild Zionist). The neocons manipulated through ‘think tanks’ andprincipally the American Enterprise Institute and the Project for the NewAmerican Century. Watch the ‘think tanks’. They are a major tool of thebloodlines to direct government policy and society in general. You’ll find thedetail in Human Race Get Off Your Knees. The Democrats have a similar groupingthat I call the ‘democons’ and these include serious players in the conspiracysuch as the truly ruthless duo, Zbigniew Brzezinski (Rothschild Zionist,whatever he may say) and George Soros (Rothschild Zionist). Brzezinski was theformer National Security Advisor to President Carter and the co-founder, withDavid Rockefeller, of the Trilateral Commission in the Round Table network.Soros is the multi-billionaire financier and Rothschild-gofer now calling for aworld central bank. This pair have been a major factor as mentor and funder inthe rise and rise of Barack Obama. One of the most influential Democrat ‘thinktanks’, the Center for American Progress, has been funded by Soros. His realname is George Schwartz, and he helped to confiscate the possessions of fellowJews in Nazi-occupied Hungary while posing as a non-Jew. I have put long-timeRothschild and Rockefeller asset, Henry Kissinger (Rothschild Zionist), in thedemocons’ crowd in Figure 193 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos619601],because he is an advisor (dictator) to Obama. Kissinger has spent the rest ofhis political life manipulating from the Republican side. So we have the neoconscontrolling the Republicans and the democons controlling the Democrats, and theneocons and democons both answer to the next level, the bloodline families, whoanswer to the Reptilian Alliance. No matter which party gets into apparent powerthe same force calls the shots whatever. The so-called ‘Tea Party’ movement hasemerged in the United States in recent years to entrap those who aredisillusioned with the Republicans, but won’t vote Democrat. It has beenpromoted as some sort of ‘revolution’ when it is nothing of the kind. The TeaParty has been given serious financial and logistical support by RothschildZionists Charles and David Koch, the billionaire owners of Koch Industries withannual revenues of $100 billion. Nothing connected in any way to them is goingto be a ‘revolution’ and nor is anything that has Sarah Palin as its ‘postergirl’. The same story can be found in Britain and virtually every other countrywith ‘different’ parties answering to the same force. This is the reason whynothing has changed since ‘Mr Change’ Obama replaced Bush; and why nothing haschanged in Britain after the Conservative Party, in coalition with the LiberalDemocrat Party, replaced the Labour Party. Rothschild yes-man, Tony Blair, was aLabour prime minister for a decade and, at the time of writing, Rothschildyes-man David Cameron is the Conservative prime minister. Few people in worldpolitical history could have claimed more often than Obama in a year ofEl-ection campaigning that they were going to be ‘different’ (Fig 194[../Text/index_split_040.html#filepos619901]). But what has happened? He hascontinued to front-up the same policies pursued by the Bush administration and,in many cases, made them even more extreme. It’s the same with Cameron in the UKwho also played the ‘change’ card (Fig 195[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos620253]). Political con-artists use theword ‘change’ so much when they want your vote because they know it works.Events are orchestrated by the bloodline families to ensure that most people arenever happy with the status quo. They would like things to ‘change’ and so alongcome people like Obama to tell them what they want to hear – ‘I stand forchange.’ But they never explain exactly what they mean by ‘change’. They onlyrepeat the word – and others, like ‘hope’ – to program a perception. When theyget into office they do what their masters tell them to do. The public falls forthis time after time. Obama was the most blatant fraud you could ever imagine ashe strutted around parroting meaningless platitudes to the heaving crowds whogave their collective minds away to a perception-control program designed tomake him president. I wrote an article in the weeks before he came to officeamid the Obama frenzy. It was headed: Barack Obama: The Naked Emperor, and itdidn’t make me popular with many people, but I didn’t care. It was the truth. Itbegan:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00223.jpg] Figure 193: Two parties – one master "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00224.jpg] Figure 194: Obama’s ‘change’ – business as usual, and then some "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00225.jpg] Figure 195: Same old line, same old lie – unless they mean change for the worst > I am writing this in the last days of 2008 as I watch with dismay as vast> numbers of people across the world, including many who should know better,> have been duped by the mind-game called ‘Operation Obama’.

This wasn’t prophecy; it was mere observation and knowing how the game works.People ask me if this or that president is ‘involved’ with what I have spent allthese years exposing. Or what about this prime minister and that one? I alwaysanswer the same – is he president or prime minister? Well, he’s involved then,in the sense that he will fall into one of those four categories that I listedearlier from knowingly-involved through to idiot. This is what all those peoplemissed who accept that there is some kind of global conspiracy, yet stillsupported Obama because he was ‘different’. Do they really think that someonefunded into office by Goldman Sachs, Wall Street and George Soros is going toput the interests of the people first?? A would-be president requires crazyamounts of money to campaign for the party nomination to run for president,never mind actually running. Bloodline families ensure that their selectionsattract the funding. They own the presidency. Nobody who is genuine and hasintegrity can get even close. Only actors and professional liars are consideredas candidates – safe people who know how to take orders. The bloodlines fundboth candidates and make sure that the one they want wins. They do this bypitting him against a poor alternative, and by sabotaging the other guy’scampaign through manipulation and bad media coverage. This technique is used inevery country. Check out who they made opposition leaders during the years ofMargaret Thatcher and Tony Blair when the bloodlines wanted them in power. Lookat the Labour opposition leader in the UK now they want to give Cameron a freerun. I remember watching the American presidential campaign when Father GeorgeBush beat Michael Dukakis in 1988. I didn’t know what I know now and I wonderedwhy Dukakis clearly wasn’t trying. Father George was purposely lacklustre whenit was the turn of his mate, Bill Clinton, to secure the presidency. Obama waspromoted as the young, vibrant new kid on the block and so they pitted himagainst the elderly John McCain who was further undermined by his running mate,Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska who should not even be let loose on a garagesale (or a Mensa test). Obama is a very willing puppet, that’s for sure, and hedutifully reads the words written for him on the ever-present teleprompterscreens on either side of him. He is constantly looking left and right assomeone else’s words appear before him. Obama hosted a St Patrick’s Day event atthe White House in 2009 attended by Irish Prime Minister and economy destroyer,Brian Cowen. Obama went to the podium and thanked himself for inviting everyone,because Cowen’s words were on the teleprompter screen (Fig 196[../Text/index_split_042.html#filepos624826]). I know that we live in adreamworld every time I see Obama at work, and the reaction to him. I wassquirming in 2011 at the sight of members of the British Parliament in awe of ateleprompter-reader who was fronting a campaign of terror in North Africa andthe Middle East that is planned to lead to World War III. One commentator wasexactly right:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00226.jpg] Figure 196: ‘It says I’ll have a pizza and a coffee’ > It took the President a very long time to force his way through Westminster> Hall after making his over-hyped speech.

These so-called ‘representatives of the people’ were on their feet at the end ofa banal speech in Westminster in which Obama couched, in terms that were trulysickening, the agenda for war and acquisition intended to slaughter and maimuntold numbers of people. He said of Britain and America: > As millions are still denied their basic human rights because of who they are,> or what they believe, or the kind of government they live under, we are the> nations most willing to stand up for the values of tolerance and> self-determination that lead to peace and dignity. Those words were spoken by a man who, together with his British sidekick, DavidCameron, was waging war in multiple countries, and from the shadows in manyothers – not even the shadows in the case of the US unmanned dronebombing-campaign in Pakistan that has already killed large numbers of people.Those words were spoken by a man who has yet to produce a birth certificate toprove that he even qualifies to be President. He has spent – or someone else has– some $2 million to fight legal challenges to force him to prove that he is anatural-born American citizen, as you have to be to become president. He issuedin desperation a series of blatant forgeries. There is one of two reasons forthis. Either he wasn’t born in America; or the birth certificate would revealthat his father is not the one he claims him to be. Hardly a single entry onObama’s official ‘CV’ is true. Students who attended college and university atthe same time that he claims to have been there say they never saw or heard ofhim. Fox News asked 400 students at Columbia University when Obama was allegedlya student if they remembered him. None did. Wayne Allyn Root was a politicalscience major at Columbia supposedly in the same class as Obama if the officialstory is true. Root said: ‘I don’t know a single person at Columbia that knewhim, and they all know me. I don’t have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obamaat Columbia.’ He said that the person who writes the class notes, and knowseverybody, had yet to find a single person at Columbia that knew Obama. Theofficial story of Obama’s life is a stream of provable lies. Why? No wonder hehas refused requests to release his Colombia records. They don’t exist. Nor willhe talk about his time at Columbia or name a single fellow student that he metthere. Who is this guy with no school records or birth certificate? Where did hecome from? A laboratory? Another question: What the heck are those major scarson his head and down to his neck shown in Figure 197? They are unexplained, likeeverything else about Obama, even though they are so obvious. The ManchurianCandidate, the movie that involved an American president having a microchipimplanted in his brain to control him, was based on what does happen to theextent that these leaders are put through serious levels of mind-programming.Nothing is left to chance by the bloodlines. This mystery man with thefraudulent life story was demanding the power in 2011 from the ludicrouspaid-for puppets on Capitol Hill to take America to war with anyone, andanywhere that he chooses – no Congressional approval necessary. Obama – a newemperor of a new Rome. He claims to stand ‘for the values of tolerance andself-determination that lead to peace and dignity’ and yet his first decision inoffice was to sanction drone bombing-attacks on Pakistan. He won the Nobel PeacePrize before vastly increasing troop numbers in Afghanistan and ordering theheartless bombing of civilians in Libya. This is the man of war claiming tostand for peace; a man of lies talking about standing for integrity. Thedreamworld is on public display. Boy Bush is a deeply unpleasant character, andgrossly arrogant in a ‘my daddy is bigger than your daddy’ sort of way; and heis an empathy-deficient idiot. But Obama is far beyond that. This guy is dark –real dark. Behind the painted smile lies a cold, calculating, ruthless,narcissistic, psychopath/sociopath with eyes to match (Fig 198[../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos632081]). The term ‘narcissist’ comes fromthe Greek myth about Narcissus who fell in love with his own reflection in thewater and died because he was so mesmerised that he couldn’t leave. I have hadextreme narcissists in my own life so I speak from first-hand knowledge. In myexperience, they usually have no talent whatsoever, except for deviousmanipulation, no desire to provide for themselves, and they operate asprofessional parasites feeding off any host they can find. But their narcissismand monumental levels of self-obsession mean that they can parasite off otherpeople, even directly steal from them, yet still convince themselves that theyhave a right to what they can exploit from the talents and efforts of others asthey compensate for the fact that they have neither. If they didn’t convincethemselves of this, they would have to face the truth that they areunscrupulous, devious, heartless parasites, and that is never an option for anarcissist. Another trait in many of them is the need to put pictures ofthemselves on display wherever they can – look at me, me, me – especially withwell-known people through which they think they can glean some sort of reflected‘glory’. I know some narcissists with websites that have wall-to-wall picturesof themselves and virtually every word is about me, me, me. Incredible.

The same applies toBlair, Cameron, Bush, Cheney and all the rest. This is the Illuminati blueprintfor their place-people in government. How could it be anything else when empathywould make you incapable of slaughtering the innocent? What use is a conscienceto a tyranny? Obama and Cameron are blueprint ‘leaders’, and the blueprint isBlair. For a decade, former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, perfected themould that was used to clone this pair of professional liars and hypocrites. Thebasic software program is to constantly smile in public to hide the darkness ofyour eyes which betray the darkness of your soul; and to speak of peace,justice, integrity and ‘values’ while you bomb the innocent under the cover oflies and deceit, because you ‘value’ only power and to follow the orders of yourhidden masters. Isn’t that right, Mr Rothschild? NATO is the killing-machine forpeople with ‘values’. Blair sent British forces to war five times in his firstsix years in office – more than any other prime minister in history – yet stillclaimed to stand for peace and integrity. Obama and Cameron do the same as theyengage their troops in open wars, and many others if you include the dark artsof covert manipulation and, in Obama’s case, the gathering war with Pakistan.But, of course, in line with the Blair Blueprint, they have to hide what theyreally are behind a carefully-designed fraudulent persona called ‘nice chap’,‘man of the people’, ‘one of us’, ‘pretty straight kind of a guy’. When Obamawas on his State visit to Britain in 2011, he and Cameron smiled, played stagedping-pong, and even cooked burgers at a Downing Street garden party. Round andround the garden – just like Tony Blair. Oh, they’re such nice blokes; look atthem laughing. But, while all this was going on, soldiers and the innocent weredying across the Middle East and North Africa from the actions that ‘call me,Dave’ and ‘call me the son of a Kenyan goat-herder’ had sanctioned. Soldiers arenot killing and dying ‘for their country’; they are doing it for the bloodlinesand their corporations that are intent on destroying their country and enslavingtheir families (Fig 199 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos636477]). Obama andCameron, like Bush, Blair and Bill Clinton, are just bag-carriers for those thatput them in office, and so the direction and rhetoric are the same when a‘Democrat’ replaces a ‘Republican’ in the United States, or ‘Conservative’replaces ‘New Labour’ in the United Kingdom. Blair (Labour) goes to war withClinton (Democrat); Blair (Labour) goes to war with Bush (Republican); Cameron(Conservative) goes to war with Obama (Democrat). Nothing changes. The killinggoes on because the same force is constantly in control. Only the front-peoplechange. Obama managed to cram a great chunk of the Illuminati-bloodline plan forthe world into a single paragraph in his Westminster speech in 2011:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00230.jpg] Figure 199: Soldiers don’t ‘fight for their country’ – they fight for thoseseeking to destroy and enslave their country Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) > In a world where the prosperity of all nations is now inextricably linked, a> new era of cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stability of the> global economy.

I dubbed the first one a long time ago: ‘Problem–Reaction–Solution’.I call the second the ‘Totalitarian Tiptoe’. They work in concert to advanceIlluminati plans by justifying changes they want to impose while hiding theconnections between world events. Problem–Reaction–Solution works like this: Youwant to make changes in society that you know would normally attract strongresistance if you openly announced what you intended to do. This includeseverything from going to war to removing basic freedoms and introducing a policestate. So you don’t openly declare your intentions. You instigateProblem–Reaction–Solution (PRS): (1) You create a problem. It could be aterrorist attack, a financial crash or a war – whatever suits the outcome thatyou are looking for. You then blame someone or something else for the problemthat you have covertly created. (2) You want a reaction of fear and ‘dosomething’ from the public when you tell them through an unquestioning lap-dogmedia the version of the problem that you want people to believe, and therepeater media reports your version of events as if it’s true. This could bethat Osama bin Laden orchestrated 9/11 from a cave in Afghanistan; or that swineflu is deadly and broke out on a pig farm in Mexico, when it didn’t affect asingle pig worldwide. (3) You propose the solutions to the problems that youhave created, and those solutions advance your transformation of the world. Youwill see examples of PRS almost by the day once you know how it works. The twoworld wars were engineered Problem–Reaction–Solutions as I document in greatdetail in … And the Truth Shall Set You Free. The bloodlines were behind theregimes of Hitler in Germany, Stalin in Russia, Churchill in Britain andRoosevelt in the United States. They had their German arm to cause the problemby invading countries such as Poland; and the solution was for their otherassets to go to war with Germany to trigger a global conflict that also drew inthe Far East in the form of Japan. It is no longer a mystery, once this isunderstood, why the Rockefeller and Bush families, and other Illuminatibloodlines in the United States, would fund the war machine of Hitler and theNazis with whom Americans would later go to war.I have been exposing for nearly 20 years the involvement in Nazi funding ofPrescott Bush – father of H W Bush and grandfather of G W Bush – and aBush/Harriman operation called the Union Banking Corporation (UBC). Then, in2001, John Loftus, president of the Florida Holocaust Museum and a formerprosecutor in the US Justice Department’s Nazi War Crimes Unit, went public tosay the same. Loftus told an audience at the Sarasota Reading Festival thatleading Nazi industrialists secretly owned the ‘Harriman/Bush’ UBC (controlledby the Rothschilds), and they were moving money into the UBC through a secondbank in Holland even after the United States declared war on Germany. He saidthat the bank was liquidated in 1951, and Boy Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush,and great-grandfather, Herbert Walker, were paid $1.5 million as part of thatdissolution. Loftus said he had a file of paperwork linking the bank andPrescott Bush to Nazi money: ‘That’s where the Bush family fortune came from: Itcame from the Third Reich.’ Problem–Reaction–Solution and the Illuminati globalweb also explain why the Rothschild-controlled Rockefeller family funded thework of Ernst Rudin, Hitler’s foremost ‘racial hygienist’, at Germany’s KaiserWilhelm Institute for Eugenics, Anthropology and Human Heredity. This involvedhorrific live experiments being performed on concentration-camp inmates bymadmen like Josef Mengele. Writer and researcher, Anton Chaitkin, says that bodyparts ‘were delivered to [Josef] Mengele, [Otmar] Verschuer and the otherRockefeller-linked contingent at the Wilhelm Institute’. The Rothschilds,Rockefellers and Harrimans were behind the whole race purity eugenics movement.They are Reptilian hybrids and so, like their fully-Reptilian masters, they areobsessed with genetics and see humans as most humans see cattle. Another mysteryof World War II is solved, too, when you appreciate this background. Why did theAmerican government not respond to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941when, as many detailed studies have shown, they had a list of confirmations thatit was coming? The reason was Problem– Reaction–Solution. President FranklinDelano Roosevelt won an election by saying that he would not be sending youngmen and women to the war in Europe; but he knew that he was going to do exactlythat and he needed a reason to break his promise while maintaining hiscredibility. Pearl Harbor did the trick, and he said that although he didn’twant to go to war he now had no choice. Nearly 2,500 people died in the PearlHarbor attack, most of them naval personnel. An estimated 50 to 70 million diedin World War II. But the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines don’t give a shit. Theyhave no empathy and have no emotional consequences. Anyone in the military orthose thinking of joining should remember that they don’t give damn if you aremaimed for life or killed. You are just a means to an end for them.Does anyone still think that the bloodlines would not kill 3,000 people on 9/11to justify all the wars and destruction of freedoms that have followed? Whathappened on September 11th, 2001 in New York was a classic example of PRS. I amnot going to dwell on it here. I have written legions about these engineeredattacks in other books but, in summary, barely a single fact in the officialstory fits with other facts. If this is true, then that can’t be true, and soon. The mainstream media repeat it without question when it is only a coverstory to hide the fact that Reptilian hybrid assets including the Israeli(Rothschild) Mossad, the US National Security Agency, the CIA and connectedmilitary agencies, flew passenger aircraft into buildings and bombed thePentagon (the aircraft strike story is nonsense). The Babylonian goddesswitnessed it all in New York (Fig 200[../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos650985]). The planes that crashed into theTwin Towers were remotely-controlled ‘drones’ and not the ones that left withtheir passengers from Boston. The Twin Towers were brought down soon afterwardsby a form of controlled demolition in which each floor exploded before beingstruck by the one above. This is why the buildings imploded and fell to theground on which they were standing without toppling over – what classicallyhappens in controlled demolitions. It also explains why the buildings fell invirtually freefall-time, confirming the lack of resistance.

The cover story of Muslimterrorist attacks was used to frighten the public, and to justify wars and aglobal assault on the most basic freedoms by the police state that has beenrolled out ever since (Fig 201 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos651380]).Hitler justified the introduction of the Gestapo in precisely this way afterNazis set fire to the German Parliament, the Reichstag building in Berlin, andblamed someone else. Hitler said that the Gestapo was needed to protect thepeople: ‘An evil exists that threatens every man, woman and child of this greatnation. We must take steps to ensure our domestic security and protect ourhomeland.’ Those words could have been spoken by Boy Bush in 2001, or Blair, orObama, or Cameron. Bloodline assets in America blamed 9/11 on theirlong-time-on-the-payroll CIA asset, Osama bin Laden. He was based inAfghanistan, and this gave them the excuse to invade that country and demonisethe Muslim world as part of their agenda for Africa and the Middle East whichhas been expanding ever since. Zbigniew Brzezinski, co-founder of the TrilateralCommission, and Obama mentor, wrote in his book, The Grand Chessboard, publishedin 1997: ‘Moreover, as America becomes an increasingly multi-cultural society,it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues,except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived directexternal threat.’ This ‘external threat’ was the threat of terrorism, and it wasbirthed on 9/11. They chose a ‘war on terrorism’ because that is George Orwell’s‘war without end’ in his prophetic book, 1984. When can you say that a war onterror has ended by being ‘won’? You can’t; and that’s the idea."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00231.jpg] Figure 200: The goddess of Babylon looks out over the catastrophe of 9/11 – thework of the bloodlines that placed her where she is "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00232.jpg] Figure 201: Keep them terrified and then you ‘protect’ them by deleting theirfreedoms MODUS OPERANDIYou can see common themes in these Problem–Reaction–Solution events. How manypeople know that on September 11th, 2001 there were ‘war game’ exercises undernames like Vigilant Guardian, Vigilant Warrior, Northern Guardian and NorthernVigilance happening either in precisely the same skies that the alleged‘terrorist hijacks’ were also happening or caused planes from the east coastdefence system to be transferred to other areas of the country? Some of themwere simulating airplane-hijack scenarios over the New York and Washington D.C.regions, and one even included a plane being flown into a government building atthe same time as the 9/11 attacks were happening. This was done to create totalconfusion among the military and civilian response systems that are theresponsibility of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and theFederal Aviation Administration. I have seen NORAD logs for 9/11 and havepublished some of them in other books. The manufactured confusion is clear tosee. They were asking, ‘Is this real world or exercise?’ This allowed otherswithin NORAD, those who were part of the 9/11 ‘team’, to misdirect and delay thearrival of jet fighters until the deed was done. How many know that an exercisescenario that mirrored the London tube train bombings on July 7th, 2005 washappening at the very same time that the real bombs exploded and the exerciseinvolved the same tube stations? Or that a NATO ‘anti-terrorism’ exerciseconcluded in Madrid shortly before the train bombing of 2004? Or that ‘sourceswithin the top level management of the police’ in Oslo told the Norwegiannewspaper Aftenposten that police had been conducting a ‘training exercise’ inthe hours before the bombing and mass shootings in Norway on July 22nd, 2011which was based on a ‘practically identical scenario’ to what actually happened?The Oslo bomb went off only 26 minutes after the police exercise ended. Put thatlot into a computer and work out the odds. The official story of PRS events isjust that – a story. Its purpose is to hide what really happened. Cover storiesare lies by definition, and with so many interwoven lies for them to deal withthe contradictions become obvious (except to the mainstream media). The officialstory of the London tube and bus bombings in July 2005 is as equally ludicrousas the fairy tale about 9/11. The alleged four ‘suicide bombers’ were not seenby any of the survivors except for the claims of a single man whose evidence issimply not credible. They were supposed to have detonated bombs carried inrucksacks with a ‘terrorist’ on each of three tube trains and a bus. But therewere multiple holes in the floors of the carriages and in one of them threepeople fell into three different holes. Passengers standing next to where one‘bomber’ was reported to have been escaped virtually unscathed, while otherswere killed who were nowhere near where the ‘terrorists’ were reported to havebeen. Twelve hours after survivors had been released from one bombed carriagethe remaining dead bodies that were left were counted, and numbered seven. Allseven have been named and accounted for and so leaving no-one remaining to bethe actual bomber. They say that he must have been blown to small pieces, yetpassengers next to ‘him’ escaped without serious injury. The authorities claimedat the same time to have found identity documents of the bombers at the scene!The whole story is absurd, because, as with 9/11, it isn’t true. There were no‘suicide bombers’ with devices in rucksacks. The bombs were planted under thetrains by military Intelligence – if that is not a contradiction in terms. Thisis why so many of the dead and injured had legs and feet blown off and why somany said the explosions ‘lifted’ the carriage from the track. Metal around thehole that one witness saw was coming into the carriage and not going out fromit. Okay, no problem. We can solve this in a trice by looking at the mostcrucial evidence – the wreckage of the carriages. Oops, sorry, no can do. Theywere destroyed by the authorities, just as the metal from the Twin Towers thatwould have confirmed what brought them down was taken away and sold off on theorders of New York Mayor, and 9/11 ‘hero’, Rudy Giuliani. The same theme can befound with the debris from the Murrah Building in Oklahoma that could haveexplained what happened there in another Problem–Reaction–Solution in 1995. Itwas removed and put under armed guard never to be seen again. The bloodlines cancarry out and then cover up these so-called ‘false flag’ terrorist attacksbecause they control governments, Intelligence agencies, the military and themedia.Tony Farrell, a Principal Intelligence Analyst for England’s South YorkshirePolice, went public in 2011 with his conclusion that both 9/11 and the London‘7/7’ bombings were ‘inside job’ attacks by government and military agencies. Hereached this view after researching the official stories and finding them to bea pack of lies. Farrell had already established to his own satisfaction that9/11 was a false flag attack when a British government minister suggested thathe should also investigate the London bombings in which 56 people died. He didso and said that it wasn’t long before he realised that the official story of7/7 was ‘a monstrous lie perpetrated by our own Intelligence service with cleargovernment complicity at the time’. The government was headed by mass murderer,genetic liar and Rothschild Zionist gofer, Tony Blair, and it just so happenedthat Benjamin Netanyahu, now Israeli Prime Minister, was close to the scene thatday. The Israeli Intelligence agency, Mossad, is the global enforcer for theHouse of Rothschild and expert at false flag terrorist events. Well, after all,it has had lots of practice. Blair was also prime minister when weapons expert,Dr David Kelly, was murdered by the Intelligence services because he had theknowledge to scupper the lie about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Theofficial story of ‘suicide’ is yet another provable fairy tale. Tony Farrellcame to his conclusions about 9/11 and 7/7 while he was producing a ‘StrategicThreat Assessment’ for his police employers that included an assessment of thethreat of terrorism. Farrell is clearly a thoroughly decent man and he decidedthat he had to include the threat from Intelligence agencies performing ‘insidejobs’ in his assessment of the dangers to human life. He was, of course,dismissed from his job before he could include his findings in the threatassessment and he says that police officers who sacked him encouraged him toappeal the decision. The ‘Director of Intelligence’ said to him: ‘Tony, what canwe do about it? We are just the foot soldiers of the government.’ Hey, people inuniform – you have children and grandchildren who have to live in the world thatyour shaking boots are going to leave them. Get off your bloody knees and getsome backbone. We are facing a critical time and we don’t need mice in uniform,thank you. Farrell wasn’t, at first, even saying officially in his assessmentthat 9/11 and 7/7 were inside jobs. He couched it in terms that there was athreat to public order when the public eventually believed in large numbers thatboth attacks were by the very government and its agencies that ‘condemned’ themand went to war because of them. Even this was too much for his policeemployers. All they wanted was that ‘Islamic terrorism’ was the threat, nothingmore necessary. In the end, however, he went the whole ‘nine yards’ in 2010 andproduced a document detailing why the official versions of 9/11 and 7/7 wereflawed. He went on three weeks leave which was extended to ‘gardening leave’(suspension) and then dismissal. He went through a ‘disciplinary hearing’ inwhich the ‘prosecution’ admitted that what he was saying could be true, but hewas dismissed on the grounds of his views being ‘untenable’ with the officialversion of events. Farrell was never told that his beliefs were ‘incorrect’,only that they were ‘untenable’. See how it works? He also confirmed that whatdid and did not constitute a ‘threat’ was dictated to all police Intelligenceanalysts from ‘on high’. He called the whole thing a ‘monstrous tyranny’. TonyFarrell is a committed Christian, and there is a point to be made here. I haveexposed the Christian religion in this book and other books, and quite rightly,but there are many people who take the best of the Christian philosophy andexpress it in their lives. They are not, however, doing what is right because oftheir ‘Christian religion’. They are doing so because of a sense of fairness,justice and decency.image [../Images/00233.jpg] Figure 202: We were asked to believe that a hijacker’s paper passport was found,let alone found intact – after this Another aspect of false flag events is to ‘build the image’ to manipulate publicperception. They know that most people don’t retain detail so they say what isnecessary to sell them a perception of what happened, and the simpler thebetter. Immediately after 9/11, I watched a BBC newsreader as she told me –without laughing – that the FBI had called a news conference to announce thatthey had found a passport from one of the alleged hijackers near to Ground Zero.A paper passport had been found despite the massive fireball that was generatedwhen the planes hit the buildings and despite the fact that most of the bodieswere never recovered (Fig 202). This even eclipsed the stroke of amazing goodfortune that the bag of the alleged ‘lead hijacker’, Mohammed Atta, wasmistakenly not loaded onto the plane at Boston Logan Airport and so its‘contents’ could confirm his involvement. ‘Hijackers’ left Korans in hotel roomsand hire cars, almost everywhere they seemed to ‘go’, according to the officialstory. What were they, the Muslim equivalent of the Gideons? They apparentlyalso left flight-manuals and boxcutters at the same locations. None of this istrue, of course, but it doesn’t have to be for most people. ‘Hey, honey, theysay they’ve found a passport from one of them there hijackers. See, it was themMuslims. What time’s the game show on?’ As the words of the old song go … ‘Ibelieve in miracles.’ A great example of selling an ‘image’ was during thelaughable nonsense about bombs in parcels on transport planes originating inYemen in 2010. I watched live pictures on CNN during this manufactured ‘scare’showing an Emirates’ airline passenger plane being ‘escorted’ into New Yorkairport by US fighter jets on either side. The report said that this was beingdone after rumours that it might be carrying a parcel that began life in theYemen!! Oh, my God, Aaaaaaaggghhh! Anyway, my question is this: If there was aparcel bomb on board and if it went off, what were the military planes going todo? ‘Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Would you pleasecalmly make your way to the hole in the side of the aircraft and jump in anorderly fashion onto the air force jet flying alongside. Thank you for flyingEmirates, we know you have a choice.’ It’s all bollocks, of course; it was abouthaving people see a passenger aircraft and military jets flying together to sellan image. It’s all about perception manipulation – mind control.RIOT–REACTION–SOLUTIONThere are moments that bring me close to despair at the ignorance that aboundsat every level of global society with regard to the manipulation of humanperception. The violent riots, arson and looting in London and other Britishcities in August 2011 were a real head-shaker for me. Perpetrators, victims andthe public in general dutifully read from the script written for them long ago –while not even knowing that such a script existed. They thought they were takingtheir own actions or responding with their own reactions. But they were not. Iwrote a newsletter in 2009 headed: ‘Please Don’t Riot – It’s Just What ‘They’Want.’ It was obvious what was going to happen around the world in the wake ofthe economic crash. The genuine hardship and understandable resentment of thosesuffering the consequences of the crash, the bank bailouts and the subsequentausterity programmes, was going to be used to trigger the violence that wouldjustify massive advances in the police state. Problem–Reaction–Solution. Whathappened in Britain basically followed the script of the Los Angeles riots in1992 when police officers who were captured on video viciously attacking a mancalled Rodney King were acquitted by a jury. Thousands rioted in protest oversix days, and 53 people died. The ‘Rodney King’ in London was another black man– 29-year-old father-of-four, Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police inTottenham, North London on August 4th, 2011 after they stopped the taxi cab inwhich he was a passenger. Police have admitted that he didn’t fire at them, andan inquiry (so often a cover up) was launched into why he was killed by theincreasingly trigger-happy British police. Duggan’s family and friends werejoined by up to 300 people in a peaceful protest outside Tottenham policestation, but later bottles and other objects were thrown at police after anargument apparently broke out between an officer and a protestor over whatappeared to be police indifference for Duggan’s family. A very credible witnesstold the BBC that the trouble began when police attacked a 16-year-old girl whowas only asking for answers to what happened to Mark Duggan. Suddenly, it allkicked off. Violence continued throughout the night in the Tottenham area andspread in subsequent days to several other parts of London. Buildings andvehicles were burned and stores were looted. ‘Copycat’ riots broke out in othermajor English cities including Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Bristolwith more violence, destruction and theft. Five people died, and the cost ofdamage was estimated to exceed £200 million.So, the riots were the problem and along came the solution. TheRothschild-connected British Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced therewould be new police powers to disperse crowds and a ‘wider power of curfew’.Cameron indicated that social media networks such as Twitter and mobilemessaging systems could face restrictions, and he talked of extending across thecountry limits on the movement of adults and children accused of being membersof gangs. ‘All available technology’ would be used on rioters, including watercannon and rubber bullets for the first time in mainland Britain; sprayingoffenders with indelible ink to later identify them; plus … here we go …‘Ministers will consider whether the Army can take on some policing tasks tofree up more officers for the front line.’ This was only the start of what willbe justified by the riots to continue the agenda for the ever-advancing policeand military state. The global blueprint is playing out with the militaryalready involved in some domestic law enforcement in the United States inblatant disregard for the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 which ‘prohibits membersof the Army from exercising nominally state law enforcement, police or peaceofficer powers that maintain law and order on non-federal property (states andtheir counties and municipal divisions) within the United States’. That couldhardly be clearer, but some 20,000 troops are being prepared to police domesticAmerica and now the same process is being considered in the UK in the light ofthe rioting. The US authorities will also be seeking to trigger rioting andunrest to justify deployment of those troops and it is vital that people don’tfall for it. Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed any suggestion that povertywas in any way connected to what happened in Britain’s run-down cities, becausethat would mean that he was in some way responsible – and that would never do.He blames parents and ‘a culture that glorifies violence, shows disrespect toauthority, and says everything about rights but nothing about responsibilities’.He promised to ‘restore a sense of morality’. This is a man who ordered thedaily bombing of whole cities in Libya – a campaign of mass murder that targetedhospitals, universities, television stations and other civilian areas, andkilled thousands. All this death and destruction of innocent people andcommunities had but one aim – to remove Colonel Gaddafi on behalf of Cameron’sbanker associates (the Rothschild networks) and allow the seizure of Libya’sbanking and oil assets. The same monumental hypocrite talks about ‘a culturethat glorifies violence’ and restoring a ‘sense of morality’. Compared with thismass killer of the innocent, the guy looting a plasma TV is not in his leaguewhen it comes to immorality and a callous disregard for human life and property.Nor is the looting, wrong as it is, in the same universe as the looting of thepublic purse by Cameron’s banking associates throughout the world with multipletrillions changing hands in the greatest transfer of wealth from people tobankers and from poor to rich in known human history. David Cameron is straightout of the political petri dish that spawned Barack Obama, Tony Blair andHillary Clinton – they talk about ‘values’ and ‘morality’ while bombing theinnocent at every opportunity. When they open their mouths the Rothschild cabalis doing the talking, and Cameron feigned moral outrage (he clearly has none) tosell the ‘brand’ of the Orwellian state. Cameron has announced in anotherProblem–Reaction–Solution resulting from the riots that he was to be ‘advised’by the former head of Los Angeles and New York police, William Bratton, abouttackling gang violence. Bratton is chairman of Kroll, a notorious privatesecurity firm with massive connections to the Israeli Mossad and the CIA, whichran ‘security’ at the World Trade Center at the time of 9/11. Cameron apparentlywanted Bratton to head the London Metropolitan Police, but was having difficultyselling the idea to many colleagues of an American police officer in charge of aBritish police force.I have no doubt that the riots were pre-planned, as they were in Los Angeles in1992. First you create an emotional tinderbox with high unemployment, austerityprogrammes and frequent stop-and-search checks by police (all of which happenedin LA), and then you use agents provocateurs to start the fire. Things prettymuch run themselves after that with criminals and genuinely angry peopleresentful of their plight taking the opportunity to vent their criminality orfrustration and fury in the target area. Reports of this appear on the TV newsand others take the lead and do the same in other locations. By now it seemsthat the whole country is ablaze as you watch the television coverage, and thepopulation is in collective fear of what might happen to them. Job done –solutions at the ready. It was noted by many that the police simply stood asideand let the looters take whatever they liked at the start of the British riots,and this is another tell-tale sign. Eye-witnesses have told how the policelooked on and took no action as shops were emptied. Many onlookers offered theopinion that this was so blatant that the police had to be under orders to dothis. London police sources later said they were ordered to ‘stand and observe’no matter what was happening and not to arrest rioters and looters. This was allpart of the set-up. The worse they allow things to be, the more fear and outrageis generated in the population. Residents close to where Mark Duggan was shottold reporters that a police surveillance vehicle had been filming the road fordays before the killing. They described how they saw armed plainclothes policeofficers hiding in bushes, and how the taxi in which Duggan was travelling wastaken away from the location afterwards before being brought back. What camefrom the mouths of participants, victims and government was just what the HiddenHand wanted to hear. These are the powerful words of one of the rioters, and Iunderstand his frustration amid poverty, unemployment and desperately poorhousing. I see what he is trying to say and why he says it – but he’s caught ina trap set for him by those he opposes: > I riot because I’m angry. Anger envelopes me like a blanket every day of my> life. I’m angry because I’m poor, I’ve always been poor, and I know I will> never be able to afford all those nice things people are supposed to have. I’m> angry because my life is shit and I know it’s always going to be shit. I’m> angry because I know that there’s no future for me; no one will ever give me a> decent job or a hand-up in life. > I will live in the same shitty housing that my family have always lived in,> drawing down the same shitty benefits. I’m angry because I live in a shit> place full of poverty, crime, vandalism, gangs, garbage, grime and neglect.> Most days I take my anger out on myself; I engage in a wide and creative array> of self-destructive behavior. But sometimes, like last night, I direct my> anger outwards. I let my rage take over, and for a brief moment, I feel a> profound sense of release. > I riot because I hate the police, and because I know that the police hate me.> They’re racist and brutal, and they treat me like scum every day of my life,> always coming around blaming me for everything bad that happens, harassing me> when I walk down the street. I hate them because they think they’re God and> they don’t have to answer to anyone for what they do. I hate them because they> show me no respect. In a riot, you can fight back against the police; you can> stand up to them and tell them how you really feel. I understand why he says all that, and others who live the life that he does incities all over the world will understand even more powerfully; but he and hisfellow rioters in whatever countries and locations have been caught in acarefully planned pincer movement. The authorities systematically create thecircumstances that generate such anger, resentment and sense of hopelessness andthey want people to riot as their anger explodes so that the solutions waitingin the wings – the police/military state – can be unveiled as a ‘necessaryresponse to maintain order’. They are supported in this by the victims of theriots and the general public in fear of becoming victims. So many in Britaincalled for the army to be deployed on the streets which, purely by chance, iswhat the authorities want to do. Once again, I can understand why people saythat amid their resentment and fear. They feel vulnerable and seek protection –whatever that may be. Politicians like Nigel Farage of the ‘alternative’ UKIndependence Party headed straight for the cameras to demand that the militarybe called in. Those political spokespeople who are not in on the plot (the vastmajority) are clueless about what is really happening here. The riots in Britainwere psychological warfare on rioter, victim and observer alike. It was aboutjustifying the police/military state, yes, but also about dividing and rulingthe population along the fault lines of race and background, and divertingattention away from other matters. People need urgently to get streetwise abouthow the game is played. Readers of my books already know this; but vast numbersstill lack this essential knowledge, and so they serve the very establishmentthey are rioting against. We need mass peaceful non-cooperation – not riots andviolence that just serve the interests of the Dragon. This is vital, becausewhat we have seen in Britain and in gathering numbers of countries in responseto economic catastrophe and police brutality is only the start of what isplanned – and minor compared with the scale of unrest and upheaval that theIlluminati bloodlines wish to trigger. If people of all factions don’t see whatis going on and come together to challenge that which is targeting everyone,then all hell is going to break loose. It has already started – but only started– and we so urgently need to circulate the real background to what is happeningin the world. Please don’t riot, because riots are Problem–Reaction–Solutionsthat will advance the police/military state even quicker.NO-PROBLEM–REACTION–SOLUTIONThey don’t always need a real problem to use this mind and emotionalmanipulation technique, and there is a version that I callNo-Problem–Reaction–Solution. Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are a glaringexample of this. There weren’t any; but by claiming that there were, Boy Bushand Blair sold the invasion of Iraq and the killing and maiming of millions.Human-caused ‘global warming’ is another No-Problem–Reaction–Solution. They needglobal problems – or the illusion of them – if they are going to have the excuseto offer global solutions. We have the global ‘war on terror’; a global economiccrisis; and global warming. The public face of the climate con is anotherperfectly-chosen professional liar called Al Gore. He is the former vicepresident to one of the most accomplished in the art of mendacity – BillClinton. Slick Willy would never have picked a genuine and honest man as hisvice present – far too dangerous. To these two, the term ‘Big Whopper’ does notrefer to something on sale at Burger King. The aim of the global warming/climatechange scam is to bring an end to the industrial era, impose police statecontrol over the lives of everyone, and introduce still more taxation. Oh, yes,and to have a global system of ‘carbon trading’, in which companies buy and selltheir carbon production allowances, or ‘credits’. This would make still greaterfortunes for the bloodlines and their assets. These include Al Gore who set up acompany in 2004 called Generation Investment Management with David Blood, formerhead of the asset management arm of the bank you can trust, Goldman Sachs. Thecompany is known in ‘The City’ as ‘Blood & Gore’. This acquired a considerablestake in Camco International Ltd which, according to one news report, ‘… has oneof the world’s largest carbon credit portfolios, works with companies toidentify and develop projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thenarranges the sale and delivery of carbon credits’. Gore’s 2006 Paramount film,An Inconvenient Truth, and his book of the same name, would have been moreaccurately entitled A Convenient Lie. The film won an Oscar and for Gore theNobel Peace Prize (arranged in the same way and through the same networks asObama’s Peace Prize). Gore’s book became a New York Times best seller. The NobelPeace Prize, which is named after a guy who made explosives, is beyondridiculous. Among its recipients are Al Gore (for the lie of ‘global warming’);Barack Obama (liar and warmonger); and Henry Kissinger (liar, mass killer, andwanted in several countries for war crimes)."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00234.jpg] Figure 203: David Mayer de Rothschild ‘cares’ about the world. How lovely Gore may have surfaced again by the time you read this, but old Al seems to havegone off the radar since the exposure of blatant and outrageous manipulation ofthe climate data in a desperate attempt to prove the lie. Has anyone seen him? Ishall fret and worry. Think of all the time he is losing indoctrinating peopleto accept his solutions, frightening little children and getting them to turn ontheir parents for ‘destroying the world’. What will the Rothschilds think if youdon’t get on with it, Al? You know how they care deeply about the environmentand the future of our children. David Mayer de Rothschild, son of Sir Evelyn deRothschild, a pillar of the family, has been especially helpful (Fig 203). Hewrote the companion guide to Gore’s ‘Live Earth’ concerts in which celebritiessuch as Madonna and Bono sang around the world to sell Big Al’s Big Lie.Rothschild junior, who has called for a world government, wrote a book calledThe Live Earth Global Warming Survival Handbook: 77 Essential Skills to StopClimate Change – Or Live through It. So kind. So thoughtful. He was asked on theAlex Jones radio show in America why Mars was warming at the same time astemperatures were then rising on Earth (it’s the Sun!). He replied that this wasbecause Mars was closer to the Sun. Will someone send him a map of the SolarSystem, please? We now have ugly wind farms going up and ruining the lives ofpeople who live near them and destroying once-beautiful landscapes to ‘fight’ a‘problem’ that does not exist. People in Europe, Australia, and soon the UnitedStates and Canada, are being forced by law to use ‘energy-saving’ lightbulbsthat release extremely poisonous mercury if they are broken, and emit chemicalsand radiation that are a serious danger to health – all because of a lie. I havedemolished the global warming myth at length in Human Race Get Off Your Knees;but enough to say here, as if it really needs saying, that the driver oftemperature and climate is the Sun. Ever noticed that when the Sun comes out itgets warmer? Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring phenomenon and without itthis planet would not be habitable. Let’s demonise something we can’t dowithout, shall we? We also need a ‘greenhouse effect’ to stop temperaturesplummeting. The US Environmental Protection Agency has formally declared carbondioxide and five other heat-trapping gases to be pollutants that endanger publichealth and welfare. This calculated decision allows the gases to be regulatedfor the first time. Anyone looking at the graph of ‘greenhouse gases’ in Figure204 [../Text/index_split_049.html#filepos687613] would think that the one whichdominates the chart on the left would have to be carbon dioxide. But it is not.That is water vapour and clouds. Carbon dioxide is the one alongside andvirtually all of that occurs naturally. Only a sliver of that CO2 is the resultof human activity. Scientists who are experts in their field have taken apartthe official story about ‘climate change’, but governments still plough on withdestructive and controlling policies to ‘save the planet’. Whenever you seegovernments continuing with a united policy against all logic and evidence youknow that the bloodlines are behind it. The United Nations IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been the main global body for selling the lieand making it the official ‘truth’. This is a corrupt and mendaciousorganisation that I expose in Human Race Get Off Your Knees. The IPCC (IdioticPanel of Climate Crazies) issued a ‘report’ in 2011 calling for governments tosubsidise the ‘renewable energy’ industry with the people’s money to ensure that‘renewables’ produced 80 per cent of the world’s energy by 2050. The report wassupposed to be the result of scientific research, but you know by now with theIPCC that it won’t be. That figure of ‘80 per cent’ was taken directly from apaper called ‘Energy Evolution 2010 – a Sustainable World Energy Outlook’,primarily written by … Sven Teske from Greenpeace and Christine Lins of theEuropean Renewable Energy Council (EREC). This claims to be ‘the united voice ofthe European renewable energy industry’. The organisation represents the verycompanies that would benefit from governments doing what the IPCC says theyshould do. Lurking in the shadows behind the IPCC is the Illuminati Round Tablesatellite, the Club of Rome. This was specifically established to exploit theenvironment in support of the bloodline agenda. Aurelio Peccei, a founder of theClub of Rome, said in its own publication, The First Global Revolution, in 1991:‘In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea thatpollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the likewould fit the bill.’ Here are a few other quotes from the Cult of Climatology:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00235.jpg] Figure 204: The block on the left is the contribution to greenhouse gases ofwater vapour and clouds.

Scientist, David Evans, was a full-time or part-time consultant for eleven yearsto the Australian Greenhouse Office (now the Department of Climate Change), andhe went public in 2011 with an explosive exposé of the global warming hoax. Hesaid that the debate about global warming had reached crazy proportions. ‘I am ascientist who was on the carbon gravy train, understands the evidence, was oncean alarmist, but am now a skeptic.’ He said the whole idea that carbon dioxideis the main cause of the recent warming was based ‘on a guess that was provedfalse by empirical evidence during the 1990s, but the gravy train was too big,with too many jobs, industries, trading profits, political careers, and thepossibility of world government and total control riding on the outcome’. Therewe go – ‘the possibility of world government and total control riding on theoutcome’. This is another reason for the lie: to justify a world government to‘solve the problem’ and so much more that I will detail later. This was the realmotivation for making Big Al the High Priest in the Cult of Climatology (Fig205). David Evans said that ‘the governments and their tame climate scientistsnow outrageously maintain the fiction that carbon dioxide is a dangerouspollutant’, rather than admit they are wrong even when the evidence isoverwhelming. NASA satellite data between 2000 through 2011 revealed that farmore heat is being released by the Earth’s atmosphere than the mendacious‘computer models’ have predicted. Dr Roy Spencer, a principal research scientistat the University of Alabama in Huntsville and US Science Team Leader for theAdvanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer flying on NASA’s Aqua satellite, said:‘The satellite observations suggest there is much more energy lost to spaceduring and after warming than the climate models show. There is a hugediscrepancy between the data and the forecasts that is especially big over theoceans.’ The head of the world’s allegedly ‘premier’ physics laboratory at CERNin Geneva, Switzerland, banned scientists there from presenting their owninterpretations of experiments that showed a near perfect correlation betweenperiods of warming and the penetration of cosmic rays. The BBC’s governing bodyannounced that it is changing the way that the corporation reports the climatechange issue by focusing less on those who disagree with the mendacious‘consensus’. Less? How can you get less than virtually non-existent? Thisfollowed a report, unbiased I’m sure, by Professor Steve Jones, professor ofgenetics at University College, London. He said that on issues where there is a‘scientific consensus’ – human-caused climate change, the MMR jab andgenetically-modified crops – there should be no need for the BBC to findopponents of the mainstream view. The sheer arrogance of it. This is how the BigLie about human-caused climate change is protected. Obama’s global warming and‘science team’ are all from Al Gore’s cult, and the laws continue to flow toadvance the plans of the Illuminati whatever the scale of evidence to expose thelie. The Illuminati bloodlines are the world’s biggest polluters. We have hadEuropean Union officials travelling to ‘climate change’ conferences in separateprivate jets, and Al Gore himself has a carbon footprint the size of Godzilla.If they cared about the environment, they wouldn’t be suppressing technologythat could give us all the warmth and power we need for nothing from the freeenergy available in our electric universe. The great Nikola Tesla, the geniuswho is really responsible for modern electrical systems, once said: ‘Electricpower is everywhere, present in unlimited quantities and can drive the world’smachinery without the need of coal, oil, gas or any other of the common fuels.’The bloodlines know this, but they stop this free energy being exploited. Itwould mean the end of power bills and a great deal of control. We have to bekept in a situation where we need to serve the system to pay for heat and power.image [../Images/00236.jpg] Figure 205: High Priest of the Climate Cult Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) WHO SHOT BIN LADEN? ER, NO-ONEAnother example of a No-Problem–Reaction–Solution was the ‘shooting’ of Osamabin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. They are still debating the title of the book andthe movie, but some being considered are Mission Impossible (but somebodyalready had that one) and, my personal favourite, You Only Die Twice. The wholefarce was an insult to the intelligence and so, therefore, no insult at all tothe mainstream media parrots and the billions around the world who have believedthis monumental crap about the ‘shooting’ of Osama bin Laden. Their intelligenceis not insulted; you can’t insult something that doesn’t exist. One of twothings was happening here given the ludicrous official fairy tale spewing fromthe lips of Liar-in-Chief, Barack Obama, and his cronies and handlers. Eitherthey are getting really desperate or they think that the public and media willswallow anything. In fact, probably both are true. They are getting moredesperate in their race to lock down the world before enough people wake upsufficiently to stop them; and, yes, the mainstream media and billions of peoplewill believe anything you tell them – the ‘Bin Laden shooting’ proved it. Themoronic masses gathered at the White House chanting, ‘USA, USA …’ after apresident who has yet to prove he was even born in America told them that a manwho died long before had been killed again. This is quite a feat and also analarming confirmation of how childlike alleged adults can be. Hey, the presidenthas just said the Moon is made of green cheese and the tooth fairy is real.‘Tooth fairy, tooth fairy …’ (Fig 206) But times are changing, and a very largenumber of people don’t believe a word of it – and nor should they. The officialcover story for 9/11 was easy enough to take apart, but the killing of ‘BinLaden’?? Jeeez, where do you start? US military Intelligence (it’s all militaryIntelligence, not civilian) claims to have kept the ‘compound’ (actually ahouse, but compound sounds more scary) near a military establishment inAbbottabad, Pakistan, under long-term surveillance (Fig 207). They noticed a mangoing for walks in the garden and the official story says that he was given thenickname ‘the pacer’. They thought it was Bin Laden, but they could not identifyhim for sure with the surveillance technology available. Okay, yes, I believethem. I mean, they can photograph your number plate from space, but they can’tidentify a man walking regularly in a garden open to the sky. Mmmmm, yep, thatseems to make sense, doesn’t it? Well, it does to a mainstream journalist or anidiot chanting, ‘USA, USA …’image [../Images/00237.jpg] Figure 206: ‘Tooth fairy, tooth fairy…’ image [../Images/00238.jpg] Figure 207: The Bin Laden ‘compound’ at Kandy-har. The walking sticks were usedby the man they called ‘the pacer’ Osama bin Laden was widely known before 9/11 to have been suffering from kidneyfailure so serious that he needed dialysis treatment. A French televisionreport, based on information gathered by Radio France International and thenewspaper, Le Figaro, said in 2001 that in July of that year Bin Laden had beenadmitted to an American hospital in Dubai for kidney treatment and had beenvisited by the local head of the CIA. CBS News reported that Bin Laden washaving kidney dialysis treatment the night before 9/11 at a hospital atRawalpindi in Pakistan. I was specifically listening to the reports about theBin Laden ‘compound’ for mention of any dialysis equipment. This was mentionedeventually in the context that they didn’t find any. Wow! It’s another miracle!Five years in that ‘compound’ with no treatment for serious kidney malfunctionand somehow he survived long enough to be shot. The alleged visit by the CIAchief in Dubai makes sense given that Bin Laden was brought to global prominenceby American military Intelligence to be the figurehead of the US-created,trained and funded ‘Mujahedeen’ (which morphed into the ‘Taliban’) in the war toresist the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union in the1980s. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Advisor to Jimmy Carter,Trilateral Commission co-founder, and long-time ‘mentor’ (handler) of BarackObama, told the French news magazine, Le Nouvel Observateur, that he hadarranged for the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan to be trained and funded to threatenthe Soviet satellite government in the capital, Kabul. He said the plan was toentice the Soviet Union to invade and give them what he called ‘their Vietnam’.Thirty years later we had Brzezinski’s protégé, Barack Obama, massivelyincreasing troop numbers in Afghanistan to allegedly fight the Taliban which hismentor Brzezinski was largely responsible for creating. It sounds contradictory,but it’s not. There is a common denominator – whatever best suits the Agenda atthe time. Across North Africa and the Middle East today, American, British andIsraeli-controlled agents provocateurs and carefully-trained ‘rebel leaders’ aremanipulating genuine protestors to play out themes from the same basic blueprintused by the US with Bin Laden in Afghanistan. General Khalifa Hifter, a‘military leader’ of the NATO ‘rebels’ in Libya, is a long-time paid CIA assetwho lived for some 20 years in the United States very close to the headquartersof the CIA in Langley, Virginia. Hifter was promoted as the figurehead for theCIA-funded Libyan National Army ‘in exile’. This is the same blueprint againthat they used with Iraqi exiles in London in the years before the invasion. Onenewspaper report said: ‘The new leader of Libya’s opposition military spent thepast two decades in suburban Virginia but felt compelled – even in his late-60s– to return to the battlefield in his homeland, according to people who knowhim.’ I’m sure he did. ‘Get your arse over there or the money stops’ might alsohave helped to focus his mind.KILLING A DEAD MANOsama bin Laden has been reported to be dead many times since 9/11 – includingby the then Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in 2002 and by former PrimeMinister, Benazir Bhutto, shortly before her very possibly-related assassinationin 2007. Egyptian newspaper, Al Wafd, reported Bin Laden’s funeral in December2001 and said he had died from natural causes. US government insider Dr StevePieczenik said on the Alex Jones radio show in the United States that Bin Ladendied soon after 9/11 from Marfan syndrome. This is a hereditary disease that canaffect the connective tissue which holds the body together and cause seriousdamage to the skeletal system, cardiovascular system, lungs, eyes, skin and …kidneys. Bin Laden certainly showed classic traits of Marfan syndrome with histall body, long limbs and face. Pieczenik was a deputy assistant secretary ofstate in the administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan andGeorge H W Bush. He said that he could confirm the Dubai hospital story and thatBin Laden needed constant dialysis because of Marfan syndrome. This was why theclosest person to Bin Laden was a physician, he said. Pieczenik pointed out thatColonel Tommy Franks, who led the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, stated(though he didn’t mean to) that Bin Laden was dead at that time. ‘We knew thatwas true,’ said insider Pieczenik. The official ‘shooting’ of Bin Laden by ‘NavySeals’ was a ridiculous, hilarious and constantly changing stream of lies for asimple reason. It never happened. His body was never shown to the public and wasimmediately ‘buried at sea’ according to a ‘Muslim custom’ that doesn’t exist,because there was no body. They refused to release images of him for the samereason – they didn’t have any. Obama said pictures would not be circulatedbecause they were ‘too gruesome’ and ‘you know, we don’t trot out this stuff astrophies’ (Fig 208 [../Text/index_split_050.html#filepos707341]). Actually,that’s exactly what ‘we’ do when ‘we’ have the pictures or when ‘we’ have fakepictures that ‘we’ think will fool people. Unfortunately for ‘we’, there is nowa rapidly expanding alternative media that won’t allow such fakes to gounnoticed or unchallenged any more. A picture of a ‘dead Bin Laden’ circulatedimmediately after Obama’s announcement of the ‘shooting’ on the major Satanicritual day of May 1st, and this was published by many in the mainstream media asgenuine (Fig 209 [../Text/index_split_051.html#filepos707824]). The image was aPhotoshop mock-up that combined the two pictures on the left to produce the oneon the right. The hoaxed media said that it was the work of ‘conspiracytheorists’, when it was ‘conspiracy theorists’ who had been exposing it as afake! The US government said that Bin Laden had been armed and had used his wifeas a human shield during a shootout with Navy Seals. The same government lateradmitted that he wasn’t armed and he did not hide behind his wife or anyoneelse. We were told that his wife had been killed and then that she was stillalive. ‘No, no, you can’t say the wife is dead – we need her to be still aliveso she can support our story. Say we made a mistake in the fog of war.’ Butperhaps the most outrageous attempt at manipulating public perception was thenow-infamous picture of Obama, Hillary Clinton and others staring anxiously atapparently live images of Bin Laden being killed (Fig 210[../Text/index_split_052.html#filepos708219]). ‘We got him,’ the little boy inshort trousers was supposed to have said. Ah, but there is one little detail toknow here. It has since been admitted that there were no live images of the‘killing’, so these people could not have been anxiously watching them. So whatwere they watching?? The wall? The lies are unbelievable and the mainstreammedia just goes on repeating them without question. The White House comedy showalso said that they had found a ‘treasure trove’ of information and ‘homevideos’ at the ‘Bin Laden compound’. No, they didn’t, because he wasn’t there.What they ‘found’ was whatever they made up themselves a long, long way from the‘compound’."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00239.jpg] Figure 208: Bin Laden taken aboard a US helicopter to be buried at sea. TheWhite House released the picture to quell rumours that they were lying throughtheir teeth. ‘It looks genuine’, said the mainstream media "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00240.jpg] Figure 209: The Photoshop image combining Bin Laden and a dead man that themainstream media at first circulated as ‘genuine’ "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00241.jpg] Figure 210: The White House admitted that there were no live pictures of the‘Bin Laden shooting’. So what were these people looking at? And what madeHillary Clinton look so worried – a crack in the wall? YOUR EYES CAN LIE – AND THEY DOWe are now in an era of computerised imagery where we can no longer claim thatwhat we think we are seeing is actually what we are seeing. You will find avideo on my website, www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com] entitled:‘Government released videos: You think your eyes are seeing what you thinkthey’re seeing? Think again.’ The bloodline cabal has had technology for decadesthat can produce videos that look like the person and sound like the person, butare not the person. ‘Bin Laden’ videos galore have been released since his deathsoon after 9/11 to fuel the lie that he was still alive and active. They havebeen ‘acquired’ and released to the media through CIA/Mossad front organisationslike SITE, or ‘Search for International Terrorist Entities’ (but never inIsrael). SITE is run by an extreme Rothschild Zionist called Rita Katz, thedaughter of an executed Israeli spy, and is reportedly funded by the USgovernment to the tune of $500,000 a year. It is, in effect, an arm of theDepartments of ‘Justice’, Treasury, and Homeland Security. SITE works in harnesswith an organisation called IntelCenter, another releaser of ‘Bin Laden’ videos,which is headed by another Rothschild Zionist, Ben Venzke. Rita Katz and SITE‘reported’ after the never-happened ‘Bin Laden shooting’ that ‘Al-Qaeda’ hadmade a statement confirming Bin Laden’s death. Or, as CNN put it: ‘Al-Qaedareleased a statement on jihadist forums confirming the death of its leader,Osama bin Laden, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militantmessages.’ No – which circulates lies and mock-up videos under the direction ofMossad and the CIA. American investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, has pointedout that many ‘Jihadist’ and ‘Al-Qaeda’ websites are controlled by the Israeli(Rothschild) Mossad. He said: ‘Mossad has a program to distribute bogus claimsof responsibility for Islamist terrorist attacks via ‘Jihadist’ websites thatare actually operated by the Mossad and a network of ‘hasbaratchiks’, Israeliand foreign Jews who act as propagandists on the web.’ Even The Washington Postrevealed that the CIA was making fraudulent videos to discredit targets. ThePost reported that a video was made to apparently show Bin Laden and friendsdrinking alcohol around a campfire and talking about their ‘conquests of littleboys’. But, really, you would think they could do better than the laughable‘home video’ footage that they released after the ‘shooting’ to ‘show’ Bin Ladensitting on the floor flicking through TV channels, all of which featured hisimage (Fig 211). Have you ever flicked through a series of channels like thatand never seen any of them showing advertisements? I haven’t. But, no, it wasBin Laden on every one. Maybe some were advertisements in which he starred. BinLaden vanishing cream would sell by the truckload. There are, to employunderstatement, a few basic errors here that the mainstream media has notallowed to take up good drinking time – but we should. Firstly, all that we seein the entire footage is a hat, the side of a beard and the tip of a nose. Thereal Bin Laden is left-handed and yet this guy uses his right hand to change thechannels throughout. Close-ups of the ears of fake and real Bin Laden show theyare not the same, and other footage from the ‘treasure trove’ is only picturesreleased years ago. ‘New’ footage found in the ‘compound’ was circulating fouryears earlier. They did the same in 2007 when the footage was released as ‘new’when it was clearly the same video that had been circulating in 2002. The CIAhas published an official dossier on what happened and you can see that inFigure 212. Interestingly, a Chinook helicopter crashed in Afghanistan inAugust, 2011, killing 38 people including 22 Navy Seals from the unit involvedin the Bin Laden hoax. Officials said that they were not the same men that‘killed’ Bin Laden, but I bet they were. Either that, or they were killedearlier and this was the cover story. Seals from that unit would certainly knowwhat really happened – or, rather, didn’t – and we wouldn’t want theextraordinary truth to get out, would we? The official story claimed that theChinook was shot down by the Taliban, something they normally rarely admit. Itall smells like a fish factory in a heat wave.image [../Images/00242.jpg] Figure 211: Man in hat with beard flicks channels with wrong hand looking at BinLaden footage on every one. What a joke THE TIMINGimage [../Images/00243.jpg] Figure 212: The official report on Bin Laden’s demise issued by the White Housepress office So to the question, why fake the death of an already dead man at the time thatthey did in early 2011? The reasons are many, and they became obvious byofficial actions and statements that followed. One reason, but certainly not themain one, was to boost the standing of Barack Obama amid all the disillusionmentthat so many were feeling about him. How convenient that days after the staged‘killing’ there was a commemoration for those who died on 9/11 at the GroundZero site in New York where Obama contemptuously exploited 9/11 families, firstresponders and Bin Laden’s ‘demise’ to sell himself for another term in theWhite House in 2012. This focus on Obama as some sort of ‘hero’ for ‘getting’Bin Laden is crazy when, it turns out, he didn’t make any decision to ‘go in’even according to the fairy tale narrative. Of course, he didn’t. He does whathe is told to do. Some of the key reasons for the Bin Laden hoax were:1) The excuse to say that as a result of the killing there are likely to beterrorist reprisals and they have to impose more surveillance and police statecontrols in places like railways, shopping malls, department stores, hotels,churches and sports stadia. We were told immediately after the hoax that theyhad found evidence in the ‘compound’ of plans to derail American trains andattack so-called ‘soft targets’. For that, read ‘we want to expand the policestate into areas that we have not been able to justify before’. (See also:‘boxcutters’ ‘found’ in houses in Afghanistan after 9/11; the ‘hijacker’spassport’ ‘found’ near Ground Zero; and Korans and ‘flight manuals’ ‘found’ atlocations allegedly related to the ‘9/11 hijackers’.) David Boehm (RothschildZionist), Chief Operating Officer of Security USA Inc., was straight out of theblocks telling CBS that to keep people safe after the ‘compound find’, the softtargets would need to be protected using, in effect, airport-style securityincluding the sexual molestation known as the ‘pat down’. Michael Chertoff(Rothschild Zionist), former head of Homeland Security, co-author of thefreedom-destroying Patriot Act, and son of a Mossad agent, was all over the TVnetworks after the ‘underpants bomber’ incident to push full-body radiationscanners produced by a corporation that his company represents. The ‘underpantsbomber’ was another stooge and another set-up. Senator Charles Schumer(Rothschild Zionist), with decades of service to the Cabal, called for a‘no-ride list’ for Amtrak trains within days of the Bin Laden ‘shooting’, on thebasis of ‘Intelligence’ not made public (because it doesn’t exist) that was‘found at the Bin Laden compound’. Schumer said that he would press for stillmore funding for rail security, commuter and passenger train-track inspectionsand more monitoring of stations nationwide. Just say it, mate: A furtherexpansion of the police state.2) The Bin Laden hoax was exploited to win support for the wars in which theUnited States is already engaged, and others that it is planning to start – the‘Go USA!’-mentality that would move ‘Mr America’ John Wayne to tears of joy.Wayne was a Hollywood actor who became a war hero without ever seeing a bulletfired in anger. He was in make-up at the time. Former vice president, DickCheney, used the Bin Laden ‘killing’ to call for the reinstatement of torturemethods as a means of interrogation. He suggested that such methods helped toestablish the whereabouts of Bin Laden. First of all they didn’t, because hewasn’t there; and second, the methods of torture have never stopped being usedbecause these sick minds are a law unto themselves.3) Bin Laden’s fake death was immediately used to further demonise Pakistan byclaiming that they must have known that he was living there for years in the‘compound’ (when he wasn’t). Obama was immediately dispatched to theTeleprompter to condemn Pakistan and say they must answer the question of whythey didn’t know where he, well, wasn’t. Former Boy Bush speechwriter, DavidFrum (Rothschild Zionist), coined the phrase the ‘Axis of Evil’ referring toIraq, Iran and North Korea. He prostitutes his words for the neoconservatives,or ‘neocons’, who controlled the Bush administration. When this guy calls forsomething to happen, it is part of the ongoing agenda – every time. Frumdemanded, yes, yes, for Pakistan to be targeted in the wake of the ‘Bin Ladenshooting’: > Instead, even now – even now! – we’re told that Pakistan is just too important> to permit the US to act on its stated doctrine – articulated by George W> Bush’s administration and not repudiated by Obama’s: ‘Those who harbour> terrorists will be treated as terrorists themselves.’ So long as we remain in> Afghanistan, that statement remains true. The question is, shouldn’t we be> taking now the steps to render the statement less true? > The less committed we are to Afghanistan, the more independent we are of> Pakistan. The more independent we are of Pakistan, the more leverage we have> over Pakistan. The more leverage we have over Pakistan, the more clout we have> to shut down Pakistan’s long, vicious, and now not credibly deniable state> support for terrorism. These people tell you what they plan to do, and so expect the war in Afghanistanto be wound down and for other targets to emerge. The point to emphasise is thatthe bloodlines want chaos and they want things to fail. They are constantlyensuring that the status quo is not working so they can offer ‘change’ toadvance their global tyranny. They want more violence and crime, because theycan then say that we must have more draconian laws and take away freedoms to‘solve’ the problem. The world makes sense when you know this and it explainsthe revelation in 2011 that agents of the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and other government agents gave thousands ofweapons to Mexican drug gangs under orders from Washington in operations called‘Fast and Furious’ and ‘Project Gun Runner’. The weapons – AK-47s, pistols andrifles with a range of two miles – began turning up in violent crimes inPhoenix, Arizona. Money for these operations was assigned by Obama in his‘stimulus package’ (to stimulate more death and destruction) and his AttorneyGeneral, Eric Holder, is centrally involved. The idea was to create more fearand upheaval and to use the supply of arms to these drug gangs as an excuse todisarm American citizens. The motto of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Right ofFreemasonry is: ‘Ordo Ab Chao’ – ‘Order Out of Chaos’. Create the chaos andoffer the order – your order – by offering ‘solutions’. This is howProblem–Reaction–Solution operates and it is the most effective of the masspublic manipulation techniques, in concert with one other …STEP BY STEP TO TYRANNYThe ‘Totalitarian Tiptoe’ describes how the bloodlines introduce their globaldictatorship in a series of connected steps which are promoted as random‘happenings’. They have to stop people connecting the dots or they would clearlyfigure out where it was all heading. Imagine that you are standing at point Aand you know you are going to take the world to point Z. You know that if you goforward in giant leaps you are going to alert the population to the fact thatsomething ‘big’ is happening. The change would be just too obvious. Instead youadvance to your target in smaller steps – as fast as you can get away with, butnot so fast that too many people see what you are doing. I have just describedhow the nation states of Europe became the European Union. There would have beenmajor resistance if the bureaucratic EU dictatorship that we have today had beensuggested after World War II. Tens of millions died stopping Hitler and theNazis from imposing the centrally-controlled ‘union’ of Europe that he, too, wasseeking. At point A, therefore, people were sold a ‘free trade’ zone called theEuropean Economic Community (EEC), or the ‘Common Market’. Don’t worryyourselves, they said, this is not about political or financial union. TheCommon Market was only to increase trade and jobs. The decades since then haveseen an incessant centralisation of power, step by step, to the point where thebureaucrats of the European Commission are only another version of the SovietPolitburo. Jean Monnet, the Rothschild asset and so-called ‘Founding Father’ ofthe European Union, said this in a letter to a friend on April 30th, 1952: > Europe’s nations should be guided towards the super-state without their people> understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps,> each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and> irreversibly lead to federation. The letter was written the day after I was born, sixty years ago, and this ishow the Totalitarian Tiptoe changes the world step after step for as long as ittakes. You might have noticed that when nations have voted in referendums toblock further centralisation of the European Union that their governments wait awhile and then have another ‘people’s vote’ that reverses the original decision.There is never another ballot, however, once the EU has got what it wants. TheAgenda will not be denied, as with ‘global warming’. The bloodlines that controlthe European Union tell their subsidiary networks in the countries in questionto ‘sort it out’ and order the governments they control to have anotherreferendum and make sure the result is different. There is another little wheezethey employ when they know that public opposition is too entrenched to changethe outcome. They introduce what the people have voted against in another formand under another name. We saw this with the European Constitution that proposeda society-changing transfer of power from nations and people to Brussels and thebureaucrats. The French and the Dutch voted against its introduction, and themanipulators knew that they would do so again if they forced another vote. Sothey changed the name from Constitution to a ‘Treaty’ and said that the Frenchand Dutch referendum results were no longer valid. The British government madean El-ection pledge that the public would be given a referendum on the EuropeanConstitution, and the government knew they would vote ‘no’. Prime Minister TonyBlair and his successor, Gordon Brown, now refused a referendum, because theysaid the ‘new’ document was a treaty, and a referendum had been promised on aconstitution. Well, what do you expect from a pair of professional liars? The‘treaty’ included 98 per cent of what had been in the ‘constitution’. This isthe level of deceit and dishonesty that we are dealing with. They don’t give adamn what we think. What they want is all that matters. A newspaper poll in 2011revealed that British people wanted to withdraw from the EU by a margin of 55per cent to 33 per cent. Will they get the chance to vote to do so? No.Ireland was the only country that did have a chance to vote. The Irishconstitution demanded that a referendum had to be held for major changes ingovernment structure to take place. The Irish rejected the treaty, but PrimeMinister Brian ‘What’s my name? Where am I?’ Cowen was ordered to have a secondvote by his masters in the shadows and, hey presto, the people voted ‘yes’ – atleast officially. The Lisbon Treaty, as it became known, has created a UnitedStates of Europe, and in the small-print and legal jargon the document gives EUbureaucrats free reign to do what they like. The European Union is afascist/communist tyranny and the ‘El-ected’ European ‘Parliament’ is only anirrelevant talking shop that allows the EU to call itself ‘democratic’. TheEuropean Union is bought and paid for at every level. There are few betterexamples of this than what happened in a vote at the British Parliament in 2011over proposals to give people a referendum on any further proposals to transfermore power to Brussels. A despicable band of former EU bureaucrats andpoliticians who are now unelected members of the House of Lords voted togetherto block any such opportunity for the people to have their say. They includedthose frauds of frauds, Neil Kinnock and his missus, Glenys Kinnock. There arealternative words to the socialist song, The Red Flag. They go: ‘The workingclass can kiss my arse, I’ve got the foreman’s job at last.’ They could havebeen written for this pair. Neil Kinnock was made leader of the Labour Party inthe 1980s to ensure that Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher, would have notrouble winning El-ections. He was the ‘man of the people’ from the socialistheartland of South Wales who never used one word when 67,485 would do. He wasknown as the ‘Welsh Windbag’ and he was all delivery and no substance. The term‘turncoat’ does not do him justice. Put any adjective you like in front of theword and it still wouldn’t suffice. This is the man who campaigned against warsand then supported Tony Blair who can’t get enough of them. Kinnock called forBritain to withdraw from what is now the European Union and scrap the unelectedHouse of Lords, but he is now called Lord Kinnock and his wife is BaronessKinnock. They are both members of the House of Lords and they both made anabsolute fortune at public expense from the European Union where he was aBrussels bureaucrat and she was a member of the EU parliament. They made anestimated £8 million in salary and expenses and they now enjoy lucrative EUpensions – all paid for from the taxation of the ‘working class’ that they usedto claim to represent. But it gets worse. Kinnock is reported to receive anannual pension from the EU of nearly £100,000 a year, and the ‘Baroness’ nearly£70,000. These extraordinary pensions come with strings attached, however. Waitfor this … there is a ‘loyalty clause’ which means that any former employee ofthe European Union who speaks out against the EU, or does not remain loyal toits aims, can be ‘deprived of their right to a pension or other benefits’. Firstof all, that is beyond outrageous and nothing less than institutionalisedbribery. Don’t rock the boat and you’ll still get the money. Secondly,self-interest groupies like the Kinnocks are not going to do anything that wouldthreaten their seats on the gravy train. That could be a good family motto forthem: ‘Don’t rock the boat, take the gravy train.’ They can have that one forfree, I won’t charge. So, the Kinnocks & Co. slithered along to the House ofLords to vote the way the EU bureaucrats demanded to stop the people having avoice on how they are governed. They included representatives of ‘different’parties in Britain’s one-party state, but they came together in a common cause:greed and self-interest.

The EU controls far morecountries under its fast-emerging jackboot than the Soviet Union ever did.Vladimir Putin, the former Russian president, now prime minister, and soon to bepresident again if all goes to plan, has called for the EU ‘free trade’ area tobe extended into Russia. Putin is just another Rothschild bag carrier. The Houseof Rothschild funded and orchestrated the Russian ‘Revolution’, and they havecontrolled the country ever since (see … And the Truth Shall Set You Free).‘Revolutionaries’ like Rothschild Zionists Lenin and Trotsky were puppets of theRothschild networks. The Soviet Union and now Russia are no different to the‘West’, and nor is China. They are owned by the global banking cartel. Theengineered Cold War provided the excuse for NATO to be formed (Problem–Reaction–Solution) to ‘defend’ Europe against the ‘Warsaw Pact’ forces of the SovietEmpire. This phony ‘war’ allowed the bloodlines to do many things that would nototherwise have happened, including the insane stockpiling of nuclear weapons.However, the tyranny has a timescale and the period was approaching when thecountries of the Soviet Union had to start being absorbed into the EU and NATO(world army). Suddenly, after decades of ‘scary’ Soviet leaders such as Stalin,Khrushchev and Brezhnev, along came a puppet and friend of the Rockefellers – MrSmiley, Feely, Mikhail Gorbachev. US Presidents, Ronald Reagan and Father Bush,and British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, were transformed in their view ofthe Soviet Union. You know, it wasn’t so bad after all. Gorbachev oversaw thebreak-up of the Soviet Union – exactly as planned – and its former colonies havebeen joining the European Union and NATO ever since. The bloodlines are notmaking this up as they go along. The Reptilian Alliance plans the strategycenturies in advance in our version of time. Actually, and the rest.image [../Images/00246.jpg] Figure 215: The all-seeing eye on the EU Council of Ministers logo The first President of the European Council was the Belgian Bilderberger, HermanVan Rompuy, a buddy of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger. He is also aclose friend of the Belgium-based Hungarian and chairman of the BilderbergGroup, Viscount Étienne Davignon, who said that the Bilderberg Group wasinfluential in the creation of the single European currency. This is a steppingstone to the world currency. The Euro has been used to delete most of thenational currencies of Europe and it will itself be scrapped eventually to makeway for the global electronic currency. The Euro will be targeted as a problemin need of a solution. The Bilderberg Group was more than an ‘influence’ on thecreation of the Euro. This Round Table satellite has been the prime driving andcoordinating force behind the covert creation of a single European State withits goddess-symbolising 12-star circle and the eye symbol of the Council ofMinisters, or ‘Consilium’, a word that derives, not surprisingly, from Rome (Fig215). The EU is planned to be the European arm of the world government with itsown police force and army that would eventually be part of the world policeforce and army. It is already happening. The plan is for the European Union tobe headed by an El-ected dictator president and this is precisely what bloodlinearse-licker, Tony Blair, has said should happen. Here is something to remember,and it never fails: Whenever Blair opens his mouth the bloodlines are doing thetalking. He has also said that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclearprogramme (let’s bomb them, I loving bombing people). Thank you, Blair, goodwork. The cheque is in the post. Now run along.So, that is the Totalitarian Tiptoe and you can see it being used on so manyfronts – the gathering police state, the step-by-step creation of a world armythrough NATO, ever-quickening erosion of freedoms and so much more. TheTotalitarian Tiptoe and Problem–Reaction–Solution are the most effectivetechniques of mass-perception manipulation.

They include secretsocieties (worshippers of Saturn); Satanism (worshippers of Saturn); andRothschild Zionism (worshippers of Saturn). Anyone see a pattern here?Paedophilia is another common and coordinating force.I will focus on Rothschild Zionism in the next chapter and I will deal here withthe networks – I guess rings would be better – of secret societies, Satanism andpaedophilia which all interconnect. I am not saying that every Freemason is aSatanist, or every Satanist a Freemason, or every paedophile is a Freemason or aSatanist. But their networks do connect and interact, and very often there is anoverlap of personnel. These groups, like Rothschild Zionism, pervade the wholeweb. They are the prime ‘cement’ (Fig 216). I have identified a large number offamous people in the bloodline structure who are Satanists, paedophiles andmembers of secret societies. The reason for their mutual association and thelink to the Reptilian Alliance will become clear. I have written reams aboutsecret societies and how they operate, their famous initiates and their covertmanipulation. There are different categories of secret society. Those closest tothe centre of the web (or top of the pyramid) are the most exclusive andsecretive. Some of the most El-ite don’t even have names and this makes themharder to track. I have mentioned some of the major ones: the Jesuits, Knightsof Malta, Knights Templar, and Opus Dei, which are all connected to the Churchof Saturn in Rome. Freemasonry can be found throughout global society from thelocal lodge in a little town to the upper echelons which connect with the spiderat the centre of the bloodline web. All the major secret societies feed a chosenfew into the inner sanctum of the Illuminati, which 98 per cent of theirmembership will not even know exists. Most Freemasons use the lodge to dobusiness or make contacts and those controlling Freemasonry use those people toprovide cover for what is really going on. Secret-society rituals plug in theinitiate even more powerfully to the Reptilian–Saturnian collective mind and tothe entities that seek to possess them. Many go through personality changesbecause of this, as do politicians who are pulled into this trap in pursuit ofcontacts and power.image [../Images/00278.jpg] Figure 216: Got the set: A Freemasonic building with the symbols for Satanism;the Illuminati symbol of the rose; the Rothschild/Saturn six-pointed star; andthe all-seeing eye Secret societies are structured in the same way as the global conspiracy ingeneral. Knowledge is strictly compartmentalised into levels of ‘degree’. Thevast majority of Freemasons are in the ‘Blue Degrees’, the bottom three levels,but the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry goes up to 33 degrees (and then theIlluminati levels for the very few). Initiates are given different explanationsfor everything as they progress, and only those in the upper levels of theIlluminati degrees get anywhere near the real truth. Tell the average Freemasonthat he’s worshipping Saturn and the Reptilian Alliance and he would just laugh.But it doesn’t matter if you know or not. If you focus upon images thatsymbolise Saturn and Reptilian entities then energetically you will be connectedto them and open yourself to possession and/or have your life-force vampired.Most initiates of secret societies are being used by the conspiracy as much asthe rest of the population. The infamous P-2, or ‘Propaganda Due’ Freemasonrylodge in Rome is an excellent example of how secret societies operate. P-2 cameto world prominence in 1981 when it was exposed for covertly manipulatingItalian society. It was run by the Mussolini fascist, Licio Gelli, who was aliaison officer in Hermann Goering’s Nazi SS. Gelli was a friend of FatherGeorge Bush, Ronald Reagan and Argentine fascist, Juan Peron. Gelli was invitedto the inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981 and spent the week with FatherBush. Reagan was a Knight of Malta, as was Gelli. Henry Kissinger was a friendof Licio Gelli and so was Michael Ledeen, a prominent neocon manipulator behindthe Boy Bush administration and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. See howthey all connect across the world. Gelli was an asset of British and RussianIntelligence and worked closely with Kissinger, Edmond de Rothschild and DavidRockefeller, who were prominent in P-2. Gelli was known to P-2 initiates as the‘Naja Hannah’, or ‘King Cobra’. P-2 was a ‘covered lodge’ (unknown even tomainstream Freemasonry), and when Italian police raided Gelli’s home in 1981they found incredible confirmation of how human society is covertly manipulatedand directed. The documents revealed that P-2 was compartmentalised as pyramidswithin pyramids. This is the blueprint, the holographic global structure thatoperates the same way at every level. P-2 was divided into different groups, andthe head of each one knew only who was in his own group. They had no idea whowas in the other groups. Only Gelli and his fellow El-ite knew that. P-2documents revealed lists of 953 members and they included influential people inpolitics, banking, business, police, Intelligence, media, military andjudiciary. There were also religious leaders connected to Opus Dei. KnightsTemplar membership lists were also found in Gelli’s possession and this was yetmore confirmation that all the inner-circle secret societies are different namesfor the same entity. A former head of the Italian Secret Service, who joined P-2in 1967, gave Gelli 150,000 sensitive dossiers on Italy’s rich and famous.Perfect if you want to use blackmail to get your way. Another P-2 member wasSilvio Berlusconi, the deeply corrupt three-times Italian Prime Minister andbillionaire media tycoon. Many of them would have been dealing with each otherwhile not knowing that they were all members of P-2. Mino Pecorelli, a formerP-2 member, said that it was ultimately controlled by the CIA and the Knights ofMalta. Pecorelli was soon dead. Pope John Paul I was murdered by poisoning afteronly 33 days in office in 1978 after he realised that P-2 was controllinginfluential people in the ‘inner’ Vatican. The number 33 is highly significantto these ritual-obsessed people. There are 33 official degrees of the ScottishRite of Freemasonry. David Yallop exposed what happened in his excellent book,In God’s Name (Corgi, new edition, 1987). The Pope, birth-name Albino Luciani,handed a list of the people that he wanted removed, with new names to replacethem, to a very unhappy Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Jean Villot. ThePope told Villot to announce this the following day. David Yallop writes: > There was one common denominator, one fact that linked each of the men about> to be replaced. Villot was aware of it. More important, so was the Pope. It> had been one of the factors that had caused him to act, to strip these men of> real power … it was Freemasonry. > The evidence the Pope had acquired indicated that within the Vatican City> State there were over one hundred Masons, ranging from cardinals to priests.> Luciani was further preoccupied with an illegal Masonic lodge that had> penetrated far beyond Italy in its search for wealth and power. It called> itself P-2.

And Vatican business continues …> The facts are here in meticulous detail, documenting widespread corruption> within the Vatican and presenting a compelling case that six powerful men, to> protect their vast financial and political operations, decided on a shocking> course of action – Pope John Paul I must die. The P-2 story is the microcosm of the macrocosm and this is how the entire weband its constituent parts run the conspiracy. Their initiates make an oath toput the secret society and its goals above all else, and that is still the caseas they go about their business in politics, banking, business, media, military,medicine and law. The latter includes judges who find people guilty or notguilty in accordance with bloodline commands. See my other books for secretsocieties exposed in great detail.HAIL SATURNThe human and animal sacrifice and blood-drinking rituals of Satanism are theworship of Saturn, the Moon and demonic entities connected, and not connected,to the Reptilian Alliance. Demands for human sacrifice by the reptilian ‘gods’is a constant theme in ancient accounts and legends. Zulu shaman Credo Mutwasaid that the Chitauri always demanded sacrifice, and that they were also theorigin of cannibalism. He said Africans were terrified of them and wouldsacrifice their children to try to appease them. Credo said the Chitauri eathuman babies, and this is another theme I have often heard around the world (Fig217). He said the worship of Saturn also involved human sacrifice, and we cannow begin to see why. The Chitauri and Saturn are, in effect, the same. Authorand researcher Stewart Swerdlow experienced satanic rituals during his timeimprisoned by the US authorities in the Montauk mind-control project on LongIsland, New York. He also highlights the obsession with eating babies andfoetuses. He said that Satanists gorge on foetuses collected from abortionclinics. ‘They also had live babies that they held up by the back of the neck,’he said. ‘Then, they slashed its throat from left to right, ear to ear, bitingdown on the gaping opening to drink the blood. This was an amazing delicacy tothem.’ Children are often bred for sacrifice and Satanists hold women incaptivity known as ‘breeders’ who are constantly impregnated to produce foetusesor babies for sacrifice. These children are born secretly and so the public doesnot even know the babies have existed, never mind what happened to them. The‘gods’ of Satanism are the demons of legend, and by demons, or demonic, I meanentities so detached from Consciousness that they have descended into ‘evil’–extreme levels of ignorance. Their mental and emotional state disconnects themfrom heart Consciousness and all they can do is to get the most that they canfrom Mind. Satanists today perform the same rituals that the ancients did. Theyoften sign a contract with their demons in their own blood. Blood carries theirvibration, and this vibrational contract locks them into the vibrational fieldof the entities even more powerfully. They are ‘possessed’. They do this inreturn for fame or riches ‘on Earth’, but they are now so literally attached toevil that they no longer have control of their life or thoughts. Satanist filmdirector, Roman Polański, who is on the run from American authorities for thesexual abuse of an underage girl, portrayed this theme in his 1968 movie,Rosemary’s Baby, starring Mia Farrow. Her actor-husband in the film sold hissoul to Satanists in return for top film roles and he agreed to allow his wifeto be impregnated under mind control to give birth to the hybrid child of anon-human entity. The child was reptilian. Roman Polanski was the husband ofactress Sharon Tate, who was murdered while eight months pregnant in 1969 bymembers of the ‘Manson Family’, the cult of mind-controlled Satanist, CharlesManson. Satanism pervades the Illuminati web, but it is most focused in the‘upper’ (cesspit) levels of society where the bloodlines and their agentspredominate. Aleister Crowley, one of the most infamous and best-known Satanistsof modern times, was connected to many household names in the satanic network(Fig 218 [../Text/index_split_086.html#filepos765400]). Satanic rituals areconducted among the 2,700 acres of redwood forest at a place called BohemianGrove in Sonoma County, Northern California. The focal point is a 40-foot stoneowl that represents, among other things, a deity called ‘Moloch’ to whom theancients sacrificed children in fire. Bohemian Grove’s ‘summer camp’ is attendedby leading names in politics, banking, business, media and so on, and theyinclude Boy and Father Bush, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, members of theRockefeller family and other deeply sick individuals who run America and thewider world (Fig 219 [../Text/index_split_087.html#filepos768990]). In May 2011,a Swiss banker, who would not be named for fear of the consequences, wasinterviewed by the Russian magazine, NoviDen. He revealed his own experience ofthe mentally and emotionally disturbed El-ite and their plans for humanity. Hesaid:image [../Images/00279.jpg] Figure 217: Satanic sacrifice rituals are constantly being performed in shockingnumbers all over the world.

Stanley Kubrick, the great film directorwho staged the version of the 1969 Moon landings seen by the public, sought toexpose Satanists of the El-ite in his final movie, Eyes Wide Shut, released in1999. It starred Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and the theme was Satanism amongthose in power and their use of mind control to force people to do what theywant. If you read some of my other books of the last ten years you will see inconsiderable detail the extent of the global mind-control programme. The mostmemorable scene in Eyes Wide Shut was the satanic ritual in a mansion where therich and famous were wearing robes and masks and being directed by the conductorof the ritual. He was wearing red, but the main body of them all wore black –Saturn. Masks are not only used for anonymity; they are symbolic of the maskthey wear to hide the identity of who they and their masters really are. It wasonly recently that I learned from Kubrick expert, Jay Weidner, that the ritualscene was shot in a Rothschild mansion. Kubrick was attempting to show peoplewhat was going on, but he never lived to see it released. Part of the deal tostage the Moon landings was that his films could never be censored, and this wasa problem for executives at Warner Bros. when they saw the final cut. They werefurious and demanded that some 25 minutes be taken out. Kubrick refused, and hecould do that because of his ‘Moon’ contract. Kubrick was dead four days laterfrom a ‘heart attack’, and the cuts were then made. When you see what is in thefilm it makes you wonder what must have been in the scenes that were censored.Eyes Wide Shut was released on the day that Kubrick had insisted was writteninto his contract. It was the 30th anniversary of the first moon landing. Thefilm came and went with hardly any promotion even though it was the final workof such an acclaimed director. David Berkowitz was the ‘Son of Sam’ serialkiller in New York in the 1970s. He admitted that he was the killer, but told achurch minister in a series of letters that he had been part of a group ofSatanists that had orchestrated the attacks. He told the minister about the typeof people that were involved in these grotesque rituals, including humansacrifice:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00281.jpg] Figure 219: David Dees’ portrayal of Bohemian Grove Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) > … Satanists are peculiar people.

It was> Aleister Crowley who said: ‘I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution,> anything bad.’ This produces the energy that they and their masters crave. I have spoken withmany former Satanists over the years, as well as those who have taken part inthe rituals against their will. They have given me a great deal of detailedbackground to what it is all about. The rituals manipulate energy; they providesustenance for the hidden ‘gods’; and they can provide an energetic environmentin which the demonic entities can manifest. The central satanic symbol of thereversed pentagram within a circle is apparently very important for this (Fig220). Once more we come back to the fact that we experience the holographiclevel of the Universe, but the base construct is waveform information. We see a‘physical’ pentagram and circle, but at the waveform level this is a particularkind of energy field – an energetic ‘stepping stone’, so I am told, that allowsentities to slip through into this reality. But these Reptilian ‘demons’ cannotleave the pentagram energy field. Satanists know these Reptilians as the ‘OldOnes’ and they are terrified of them. Stewart Swerdlow says that a ceremonialinvocation is chanted at the rituals to contact the demons in other realities,and he writes that he has heard this done in Latin, Hebrew, Ancient Egyptian,Sumerian, German, English and a ‘guttural, hissing’ language which he was toldis the original Draco (Reptilian) language. Satanists in human form drink theblood of the victim, and the hidden ‘gods’ absorb the energy of the terror thatis generated. This is the origin of the term ‘sacrifice to the gods’. The victimis so terrified at the point of sacrifice that a specific type of adrenalineenters the bloodstream, and this is like a drug to these desperate people. Itgives them a ‘high’. They also want hormonal secretions from the pituitary andpineal glands (third eye) that enter the blood when people are in a state ofterror, according to others who have witnessed the rituals. I am told that thisis ‘like heroin or endorphins’ to them. Endorphins are produced by the pituitarygland and the hypothalamus during emotional states such as excitement, pain andorgasm, and ‘resemble opiates in their abilities to produce analgesia and afeeling of well-being’. I understand that the Reptilian hybrids are having todrink more and more blood to keep their human DNA codes open and stop themmanifesting as reptilian. This is because of the impact upon them of the TruthVibrations. When the point of sacrifice nears, a Reptilian hybrid stares intothe eyes of the victim and holds them, as one witness put it, ‘in a trance ofterror’. This is the origin of the term ‘the evil eye’. Stewart Swerdlowdescribes how the sacrifice is terrorised before ‘a final thrust of a bladedisembowels them’ and the Satanists are covered in ‘rivers of blood’. Thesacrificial body is ripped apart and the internal organs and genitalia areconsumed. Swerdlow says they are in such frenzy by now that many shapeshift intoReptilians and even attack each other mindlessly. I have heard exactly the samefrom others who have taken part. The Satanists shapeshift when the frenzygenerates such an energetic charge that the hybrid DNA codes shift and project areptilian form. The Wesley Snipes film, Blade, released in 1998, portrays sceneslike those described here; and Bram Stoker’s famous stories about Dracula arebased on the same theme. Stories and legends about vampires can be found inevery part of the world, and Dracula encapsulates them. His name is Dracula(Dracoula – the ‘Draco’ is a name for the El-ite Reptilians); he is called‘Count’ Dracula (symbolic of how the bloodlines are royalty and thearistocracy); and Dracula ‘shapeshifts’ and drinks human blood. Stoker’scharacter was inspired by the character known as Vlad the Impaler, who ruled acountry called Wallachia in what is now Romania in the 15th century. This regionwas once Transylvania, which is very much associated with vampire legends. Vladthe Impaler was initiated into the ancient Order of the Dragon by the Holy RomanEmperor in 1431, with its emblem of a dragon, wings extended, hanging on across. This goes back at least to ancient Egypt, but probably much further inthis or other forms. Vlad signed his name Draculea, or Draculya – ‘Devil’s Son’.This later became Dracula, a name that translates as something like ‘Son of HimWho Had the Order of the Dragon’. Queen Mary, or Mary of Teck, the mother ofKing George VI and grandmother to the present Elizabeth II, was descended from asister of Vlad the Impaler – ‘Dracula’ – and so is the Bush family. In thesummer of 2011, research was reported by the mainstream media that revealed howthe British royal family have consumed human flesh as recently as the end of the18th century. Oh, I think it is probably just a touch more recently than that.More like a week last Tuesday. One newspaper report said: ‘Even as theydenounced the barbaric cannibals of the New World, they applied, drank, or worepowdered Egyptian mummy, human fat, flesh, bone, blood, brains and skin.’ It wasonly for medicinal purposes, though, so that’s okay, then. The source was a bookby Dr Richard Sugg from England’s Durham University entitled Mummies, Cannibalsand Vampires (Routledge, 2011). Dr Sugg was quoted as saying:image [../Images/00282.jpg] Figure 220: The prime satanic symbol of the inverted pentagram inside a circle > Cannibalism was found not only in the New World, as often believed, but also> in Europe.

Along with Charles II, eminent users or prescribers included> Francis I, Elizabeth I’s surgeon John Banister, Elizabeth Grey, Countess of> Kent, Robert Boyle, Thomas Willis, William III and Queen Mary. Rather more than ‘medicinal purposes’ was going on behind the scenes, though,just as it is now. If you get a royal invitation to Balmoral Castle in thesummer, I’d give it a miss. Cannibalism was found everywhere, because theReptilian devourers of human flesh introduced it everywhere.CHATEAU ROTHSCHILD (IT’S A RED)I communicated in detail with a man at one point who said that his real name wasPhillip Eugene de Rothschild. He was living under another name in the UnitedStates at the time. He told me that he was the unofficial offspring of the lateBaron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton–Rothschild wine estates in France andthat his half-sister is the Baron’s daughter, Baroness Philippine de Rothschild.The Baroness inherited the wine empire after her father died in 1988 at the ageof 86, and she appears to be fond of wearing Baphomet-type (Saturn) necklaces(Fig 221). Phillip Eugene told me what I have heard from many other sources. TheRothschilds have hundreds of thousands of unofficial offspring and most areproduced in sperm-bank breeding programmes to ensure the genetic(vibrational/software code) ‘purity’. Only a few are given the name‘Rothschild’. The rest are brought up by other families under other names and sowhen they come to prominence in politics, banking, business and the media, thepublic doesn’t know that they are really all Rothschilds, or the Rothschildbloodline. We are given the official life stories of people such as Barack Obama(clearly a pack of lies), Tony Blair, David Cameron, Nicolas Sarkozy andBenjamin Netanyahu; but is there another story to be told? Phillip Eugene toldme that he had been trained to infiltrate the Christian Church by posing as a‘perfect Christian’, but he later rebelled and started a new life. He said thathe lived with his Rothschild father for most of his childhood and adolescence onhis estate in France. They had a physical relationship and he was ‘held fast inthe emotional power of incest, which, in this culture, was normal and to beadmired’. I knew this, too, from endless other sources and throughout theirhistory the bloodlines have had incest as the centre of their relationships withtheir children. Incest, cannibalism and human sacrifice were all introduced bythe Reptilians. Having sex with your own children is part of the bloodlines’ wayof life and, as Phillip Eugene says, it creates an emotional control of fatherover son. El-ite families like the Rockefellers and Bushes will be just thesame. They’re probably Rothschild bloodline, anyway, like most, if not all,remaining royalty. Prince William is only one example. William’s mother,Princess Diana, was induced so that he would be born on the summer solstice. Shewas told that this was being done to make the birth fit with Prince Charles’spolo-playing programme, but it was nothing to do with that. It was simply moreritual. The bloodlines have big plans for William. Phillip Eugene confirmed thatthe Rothschilds and the bloodlines are possessed and controlled by demonicentities. ‘Being a Rothschild descendant, I was maximally demonised.’ PhillipEugene was yet another source (there have been soooo many) that connected theBritish royal family and other royal families of Europe to Satanism and the‘Nefilim bloodline’, as he called it. The Rothschild and bloodline Satanists areeverywhere in positions of influence and power. Phillip Eugene told me:image [../Images/00283.jpg] Figure 221: Baroness Philippine de Rothschild – and friend. > I was present at my father’s death in 1988, receiving his power and the> commission to carry out my destiny in the grand conspiracy of my family.

Ex-CIA Director Casey> (as were most of the CIA leadership for the past forty years), Kissinger and> [former US Secretary of State] Warren Christopher were in attendance at> non-ritual gatherings and some occult rituals as well, but well back in the> gallery. I have heard the same names, and others of global fame, from many sources whohave attended the rituals. Readers of my other books, including The BiggestSecret, will know the story of Arizona Wilder, the American woman who talked tome at length about how she was bred for the US government mind-control programmewith the specific aim of having her conduct rituals for the hybrids. Reptiliansand their hybrid ‘offspring’ are extremely limited in how far ‘out there’ theycan go. Therefore, they breed humans with powerful ‘third-eye’ psychic abilitiesto go ‘out there’ for them. Arizona said that she was programmed using manyforms of torture by Josef Mengele, often at the China Lake Naval Weapons Centerin California. She gave me a long list of names that she had seen shapeshift atrituals she was taken to by shapeshifter Mengele. These included the Queen;Queen Mother (whom Princess Diana described as ‘evil’); Prince Philip; PrinceCharles; Princess Margaret; Father George Bush; his sons, Boy George and JebBush; Jay Rockefeller; Presidents Gerald Ford and Lyndon Johnson (who wasimplicated in the assassination of JFK which allowed him to become president);former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright; and Illuminati gofer, TonyBlair (anyone surprised?). Arizona said she saw many Rothschilds shapeshift atthe rituals, including the late Baron Guy de Rothschild who operated secretlyunder the name ‘Dr Barrington’ (Fig 222[../Text/index_split_088.html#filepos786690]). She said she also saw formerFrench President Georges Pompidou shapeshift at the rituals – he worked for Guyde Rothschild and did the Rothschilds’ bidding as President of France. Howinteresting that those people that I mentioned earlier who lived, or are living,to great ages, are named by Arizona and others as Reptilian shapeshifters orattendees of rituals – the Queen Mother (102); the Queen (85 at the time ofwriting); the Duke of Edinburgh (90, ditto); Father George Bush (87, ditto);Henry Kissinger (88, ditto); and David Rockefeller (96, ditto). It must besomething in the blood – or someone else’s. Others that Arizona saw at therituals, but did not see shapeshift (it doesn’t mean they don’t) included HenryKissinger, Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, and Hillary Clinton. Arizona alsosaid that the author, Zecharia Sitchin, attended the rituals and shapeshifted.Sitchin wrote extensively about the ‘Anunnaki’ in ways that were oftenmisleading. I talked to him once about the Reptilians and he became very angry.He leaned forward across the table and said: ‘The Reptilians? Don’t go there.’As you see, I have followed his every word. He talked about the Anunnaki comingand going on a 12th planet called ‘Nibiru’ which he said has a 3,600 yearelliptical orbit and, by Sitchin’s calculations, is due to return pretty soon.Firstly, the Anunnaki have never gone away and, secondly, I have no doubt thatwe are going to see strange events in the heavens, even major ones, and theEarth could be significantly affected by these events; but whatever comes ordoesn’t come it will not be ‘Nibiru’, or ‘Planet X’ in the way that Sitchindescribed. Arizona Wilder said that Sitchin’s job was to disinform and hide theexistence of the Reptilians from those who were interested or researching inareas that could lead them to humanity’s true controllers. Collectively, shesaid, they were all ‘cold blooded and they would kill at the drop of a hat’.They love killing and that’s why they do so much of it. You will find a video onmy website: Davidicke.com [http://davidicke.com] called ‘Confessions of a MotherGoddess’. This is a more than two-hour interview with Arizona in the late 1990s.I have lost touch with her in recent years and if you are out there, Arizona,please let me know you are okay."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00284.jpg] Figure 222: Baron Guy de Rothschild – such lovely eyes Another American woman, Cathy O’Brien, told me how she saw George Bush andothers shapeshift into reptilian form. Cathy was given by her Satanist father tothe vast American military/Intelligence mind-control programme that involves theunspeakable abuse of children to shatter their minds and allow a new one to becreated. She was in a ‘special’ part of MKUltra known as the Monarch Programme,named after the butterfly, and she was raped under mind control by presidentsRonald Reagan and Gerald Ford, among so many others that talk about American‘values’. It was ‘shapeshifter’ Gerald Ford, then a Congressman for Michigan(where Cathy was brought up) who arranged for her ‘handover’ by her father, EarlM O’Brien. Ford later became President of the United States, just like‘shapeshifter’ Father George Bush. Cathy co-wrote a book with partner, MarkPhillips, exposing what happened to her, called Trance-Formation of America(Reality Marketing, USA, 1995). This is still available. She tells in the bookhow she saw Father George Bush shapeshift into the reptilian entity, but shethought this was part of her mind control programming. What she describes,however, is a mirror of what so many others, including Arizona Wilder, describe.Cathy said that Bush was sitting in front of her in his office in WashingtonD.C. when he opened a book at a page depicting ‘lizard-like aliens from afar-off, deep space place’. She said that Bush claimed that he was one of themand as he did so he transformed ‘like a chameleon’ into a reptile. I have beentold by hundreds of people from every walk of life you can imagine about theirexperiences of seeing well known and less well known people transform into areptilian form before their eyes and then go back again. Father George Bush is aname that recurs often in these accounts. Cathy relates an experience she hadwith Miguel de la Madrid, the President of Mexico during Father Bush’s tenure atthe White House. She writes in Trance-Formation of America: > De la Madrid had relayed the ‘legend of the Iguana’ to me, explaining that> lizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, their> advanced astronomical technology, including sacrifice of virgins, was> supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens> interbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit, they> fluctuated between a human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like> abilities – ‘a perfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders’. De la> Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he> transformed ‘back into an Iguana at will’. This is exactly the same story told in Central America that you find in Africa,Asia and around the world. Phillip Eugene de Rothschild said that some of themost significant people in the global power hierarchy are not publicly known.They stay deep in the shadows hiding their true selves behind apparently‘ordinary lives’. I have heard this many times as well. One of the highest level‘personnel’ within the global Reptilian hybrid network has the code name,‘Pindar’, and he operates out of Alsace-Lorraine in France. I wrote at somelength about him in The Biggest Secret. It is no accident whatsoever thatLondon’s main underground bunker and ‘crisis management centre’ beneath theMinistry of Defence in London that connects to Downing Street and othergovernment buildings is called Pindar; nor that the government’s crisiscommittee is called ‘Cobra’. Satanic rituals also manipulate and vibrationallysuppress the Earth’s energy field. The Reptilian Alliance and the hybridbloodlines want to maintain humanity in ignorance and in Mind. How do you affectall the fish at the same time? You affect the sea. The Earth’s energy field isour ‘sea’, and Satanism is one way that this is manipulated and filled withthought-forms of low-vibrational resonance that impact upon the human populationinteracting with the ‘sea’. There is something about blood being spilled (bloodis the holographic version of ‘chi’ in the meridian system) that has a powerfuleffect on the energy field. This power is also a reason why so many of thesefamous blood-drinkers live for so long. I included an appendix in Human Race GetOff Your Knees which is a document allegedly written by a dying Satanist inAustralia in 2004. He claimed to be attached to the ‘Alpha Lodge’ in Sydney.This was not a deathbed ‘confession’ so much, because he agreed with what ishappening. It is more of an explanation of how powerfully Satanism controlsworld events. Although I can’t prove that it is genuine, I can confirm aftermore than two decades of research that whoever was the source had a detailedknowledge of the subject. He described how rituals impregnated Earth’s energyfields with satanic – Saturn-ic – information: ‘What most people do not realiseis that Satanism is a ritually-based practice and that this repetition has, overtime, left strong impressions upon the Morphic Field.’ Religious and royalritual is doing the same in its own way. The ‘Black Mass’ of Saturnic Satanismis only the full-blown version of the Mass, Eucharist or Holy Communion that yousee in the Catholic Church. The drinking of the ‘blood of Jesus’ as red wine(Chateau Rothschild is a good one) and eating his ‘flesh’ as bread, are onlypublicly acceptable versions of drinking and eating the real thing.The bloodline-controlled entertainment industry is bombarding people, especiallythe young, with satanic imagery and themes in the music itself, stageperformances and videos. You can see movies and music videos of artists such asLady Gaga, Jay-Z and his wife Beyoncé, decoded with the occult meaning at:www.vigilantcitizen.com [http://www.vigilantcitizen.com]. Music is heavilyencoded at the production stage with subliminal messages, and so are films andtelevision. This is often done through ‘reverse speech’ in messages encodedbackwards or lyrics that sound very different when played backwards. Theconscious mind decodes speech in a forward sequence, but the subconsciousdecodes the speech vibration in both directions. The word ‘live’ backwards, forexample, is ‘evil’ and ‘love’ backwards is ‘evol’. It is the sound that matters– the vibration – not so much the spelling.THE LONDON–ROME BELTANE RITUALAt the end of April 2011, I flew from London to Rome for a speaking event. I wasparticularly pleased to be leaving Britain just before the ‘Royal Wedding’ ofPrince William and Kate Middleton on my birthday, April 29th. The sight ofpeople salivating over the Royal Family is not something my stomach cares totake. If only they knew. I arrived in Rome to something pretty much the same –the ‘beatification’ of the departed John Paul II, the guy that replaced themurdered Pope of the same name who wanted to purge the Vatican of Freemasons.Millions of Roman Catholics were in Rome for the ritual conducted by PopeBenedict, the chap with the beautiful eyes (Fig 223). This was another of thoseendless ‘coincidences’ that have led me to information since 1990. I had no ideaabout any beatification when I agreed to speak in Rome on April 30th, 2011. Thiswas only a day which synchronised with other European events that I was doing inthe same period. But here I was speaking in one of the great cities of theIlluminati on the day between the Royal Wedding and the beatification. PopeBenedict made an official visit to Barcelona, Spain, with millions on thestreets, on the same weekend that I presented an all-day event in the city. Ididn’t plan that, either. I could see on the day that I arrived in Rome theconnection between the Royal Wedding in London and the beatification in Romeover what was the period of Beltane – one of the most important ‘festivals’ inthe satanic calendar. The Royal Wedding and the beatification were two ends ofthe same mass Beltane ritual in two of the most significant bloodline andsatanic cities on Earth – London and Rome. I bet they were partying on Saturnand the Moon that weekend. The key date of Beltane is May 1st – May Day – whichis why so many celebrations and parades happen at that time, including the MayDay parades in the Communist world. This was when the people of the Soviet Unionwere called to the streets in their millions to watch missiles and tanks beingparaded before them. It is all occult ritual. Remember how the communist hammerand sickle is the symbol of Saturn? But, energetically, Beltane is not just MayDay. It builds through April 29th and into April 30th for the culmination on May1st. Romans celebrated Beltane in the form of Floralia, the Festival of theFlowers, in honour of the Roman goddess, Flora, and this ran from April 29ththrough to May 1st. Here we had the Royal Wedding in London on April 29th andthe beatification of Pope John Paul II in Rome on May 1st. The two rituals wereat different ends of the Beltane energetic period in two cities so rituallycrucial to the satanic hierarchy running the Illuminati agenda. Coincidence? Nota chance. I don’t want to demonise Beltane entirely, or those genuine people whotake part in their own Beltane rituals to celebrate the coming of new lifethrough the spring and summer months. Good luck to them. This is not what I amtalking about. Beltane is the period associated with the May Pole, fires,fertility and flowers and has been celebrated in different ways and underdifferent names all over the world for thousands of years. But this is also theperiod, along with Halloween across October 31st and November 1st (the dates arereversed in the Southern Hemisphere), when Satanists all over the world conductsome of their most important blood and sacrifice rituals. Note how Halloween hasbeen promoted in recent times more than ever before with the emphasis onchildren. While children dressed as ghosts and witches are knocking on doors and‘trick or treating’, others children are being sacrificed around the world innumbers that beggar belief. The promotion of Halloween is to desensitise peopleto the true horrors of the satanic occult (occultus – clandestine, hidden,secret).image [../Images/00285.jpg] Figure 223: Pope Benedict: the eyes have it The date of the Royal Wedding was selected as April 29th to start the Beltaneritual (the couple themselves probably had no idea, or maybe he does by now).All they needed was an event in Rome on May 1st. Ahhh, I know. Let’s beatify thelast Pope. Nice one. The official story of why Pope John Paul II was beatifiedis utterly bloody laughable. Vatican policy decrees that for someone to bebeatified, an unexplained healing or other miracle has to be attributed to themafter their death. You need two miracles to be a ‘Saint’ and join a long line ofmass killers and genetic liars who have gone before you. The greatest miraclefor me is that anyone is a Roman Catholic, but I digress. Lo and behold, for‘He’ has spoken, a miracle for Pope John Paul II miraculously appeared. A Frenchnun claimed that she had been cured of a brain disorder after praying to PopeJohn Paul II following his death in 2005. Quite what he has against all theother nuns with health problems is not yet clear. Pope Benedict, John Paul’sminder and handler before getting the job himself, agreed with the Vatican‘medical experts and theologians’ that the nun was indeed miraculously cured bythe departed John Paul and a date was fixed to beatify the chap – May 1st, 2011.This was also the day when, over in America, Obama was announcing the seconddeath of Osama bin Laden. Two days before the beatification gig in Rome, theRoyals headed for the Freemasonic temple called Westminster Abbey with its twintowers and black-and-white secret-society ‘Saturn’ floor (Fig 224[../Text/index_split_089.html#filepos802244]). The red carpet (symbolic ofblood) was rolled out to meet the feet of the arriving royal satanic AddamsFamily, headed by the Queen herself. Twin towers are Freemasonic representationsof the twin pillars of Joachim and Boaz that were said to stand at the entranceto King Solomon’s Temple. Every syllable of Sol-Om-On means ‘sun’, and we cannow see that it refers to the ‘Old Sun’ and ‘Black Sun’ – Saturn. St Paul’sCathedral has twin pillars or towers for the same reason and so does the ‘MotherLodge’ of Freemasonry in London (Fig 225[../Text/index_split_090.html#filepos802613]). Was it just a coincidence thattwin towers were involved on 9/11?? Prince William, a Rothschild bloodline, andhis bride, Kate Middleton, arrived to heaving crowds. Kate must be bloodlineotherwise they would not have let her near the place. I feel sorry for herentering the lair of this dark and despicable family. I hope she is okay, butwho knows what Mr and Mrs Baphomet and their cronies and masters have in mind(Fig 226 [../Text/index_split_093.html#filepos803526]). They say the Britishestablishment is the best in the world for organising ‘pomp and pageantry’. No,it is, like the authorities in Rome, the best at organising satanic ritualdisguised as a national or religious event. When the shapeshifting Queen andPrince Phillip arrived they were met by senior clergy of the ‘Christian’ Church,and you can see what one of them was wearing in Figure 227[../Text/index_split_094.html#filepos803826]. Talk about in your face – theprime satanic symbol of the inverted pentagram within a circle. Saturn, the DarkSun, within a ring. I checked the original BBC footage when I first saw thepicture, because it was so blatant.

The human sacrifice is the power source in the rituals I have beendescribing, and the power source at public rituals are the crowds that assemblein their hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, to pay homage to theSatanists and their lackeys paraded before them. The Royal Family was the focusof homage in London on April 29th, 2011; and two days later in Rome it was thepresent Pope and the departed one (Fig 228[../Text/index_split_095.html#filepos807062]). We talk about a ‘wonderfulatmosphere’ or ‘intense atmosphere’ or whatever, and this ‘atmosphere’ is theelectromagnetic energy generated by a mass of electromagnetic fields gatheredtogether called people. You might have heard the saying ‘energy flows whereattention goes’, and so it does. Homage and worship are even more intenseversions of attention. The British Royal Family, and the Pope and Vaticancontrol-structure, are servants and symbols (proxies) for the Reptilian andother demonic entities feeding off human energy. By getting the crowds to focuson these symbols and proxies, an energetic connection is established that allowsthe entities to trawl their energy. The Beltane rituals in London and Rome werespecifically set up to vampire the energy of the millions who gathered at bothevents. The hidden powers vampired the crowds in London paying homage to theLondon branch of the Reptilian global hierarchy, and they did the same in Romeas worshippers gathered in their millions in the city and especially around theoriginal ancient Egyptian obelisk in St Peter’s Square, taken from Heliopolis –the ‘City of the Sun’ (Saturn?). The official head of the Satanic Church ofBabylon conducted the ritual in Rome wearing his fish-god hat, and theArchbishop of Canterbury did the same in London (Fig 229[../Text/index_split_095.html#filepos809864]). It is all ritual. While thecrowds cheered, the global cabal that the royals represent was slaughtering theinnocent in places like Libya and imposing sweeping austerity programmes on thevery people who were waving their flags (Fig 230[../Text/index_split_097.html#filepos810361]). I shot a 90-minute ‘ad-lib’ filmabout the Beltane ritual while I was in Rome, which you can see on my website.Remember if you watch the film that when I am talking about the sun I am reallyreferring to Saturn. This was the penny that won me the jackpot and everythingelse fell into place. The information has been presented to me in the usualcoordinated way – first the Moon, then on to Saturn, and what next?"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00292.jpg] Figure 228: The London–Rome Beltane ritual 2011 Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) Religions were established to put people into a mind-prison in which only their‘holy book’ has the truth, and any other explanation for life must, bydefinition, be wrong. The religion of scientism has its own ‘holy book’ calledthe ‘scientific norms’, and they have the same effect. Religions are alsodesigned to con the con-gregations into giving their power away to a ‘god’ ordeity that represents Saturn, the Moon and the Reptilian Alliance. Religiousdeities are also symbols and proxies, and make the same vibrational connectionbetween the worshippers and the ‘gods’. The worshippers focus attention on theproxy and the ‘gods’ in all their forms say ‘gotcha’. Energy flows whereattention goes. A most obvious example is the vast crowds of Muslims who makethe pilgrimage to Mecca at the demand of their ‘holy book’. They create acolossal collective electromagnetic field as they circle the symbol of Saturn –the Kaaba cube. They even kneel down to pray in the concentric circles ofSaturn. Muslims across the planet are told to get on their knees (concede theirpower – ‘Islam’ means ‘submit to God’) five times a day and pray while facing‘Mecca’ – more precisely, the Kaaba cube symbol for Saturn in Mecca. Theirenergy is then vampired by other-dimensional entities that Islam refers to as‘the Jinn’. The same is happening in all religions and billions who think theyare following different religions, and argue, even go to war, over thoseperceived differences, are all worshipping the same ‘god’ (gods) and havingtheir life-force vampired by the same gang (Fig 231[../Text/index_split_098.html#filepos811566]). This is happening in the secretsocieties when initiates are told to ‘give themselves’ (submit) in service tothe deity. You make an energetic connection when you do that and your energy canbe absorbed and your thoughts and emotions manipulated. John A Keel says in hisbook, Our Haunted Planet (Galde Press, 1999), that the serpent race chosereligion as the ‘battleground’ on which to conquer the human mind:image [../Images/00293.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00294.jpg]Figure 229: The fish god Pope in Rome and the fish god Archbishop of Canterburyin London "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00295.jpg] Figure 230: Diversion, diversion, diversion Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) > … The para-human Serpent People of the past are still among us.

This is what is happening in satanic rituals, churches and secret-societytemples across the world all the time.SUFFER LITTLE CHILDRENI have said that the networks of Satanism and secret societies are connected tothe global paedophile rings, and there is a reason for this: the energy ofchildren. The Reptilians ideally want to vampire the energy of children beforethey reach puberty. We see puberty as a time of hormonal changes in the bodythat start the process of the child becoming an adult; but those hormonaleffects are the result of vibrational changes in the waveform informationfields. The energy that the Reptilians want more than anything is the energy ofchildren before that change happens. The ancient theme of sacrificing ‘youngvirgins’ to the gods is code for children. Don Juan Matus, the shaman source forthe Carlos Castaneda books, highlighted this. Castaneda wrote: > … He explained that sorcerers saw infant human beings as strange luminous> balls of energy, covered from the top to the bottom with a glowing coat,> something like a coat of plastic adjusted tightly around the cocoon of energy.> He said that glowing coat of awareness was what the predators consumed and> that when a human reached adulthood, all that was left of that fringe> awareness was a narrow fringe that went from the ground to the top of the> toes. That fringe permitted mankind to keep on living, but only barely. This energy is vampired in many different ways, and among them is paedophilia,which, like human sacrifice and cannibalism, has been going on since theReptilian takeover. There are paintings of naked children all over the Vatican,and I was aghast when I walked around the National Portrait Gallery in London’sTrafalgar Square while I was waiting to speak at a rally against child abuse. Iwas seeing the work of world famous artists and there were paintings of nakedchildren everywhere (Fig 232 [../Text/index_split_099.html#filepos818686]). TheRoman Catholic Church has been exposed all over the world for decades now as acesspit of child abuse, and why wouldn’t that be the case when it represents anancient unbroken stream of belief and ritual that involves human sacrifice andchild abuse? The Roman Church is continuing to do what it has always done underendless different names (Fig 233 [../Text/index_split_102.html#filepos819366]).While the paedophile is having sex with the child, the possessing entity isusing the paedophile as a conduit, a bridge, to vampire the child’s energy (Fig234 [../Text/index_split_103.html#filepos819881]). The scale on which thishappens worldwide is staggering and many of the ‘hotspots’ are, of course,centres for the El-ite like Britain and Europe, North America and Australia; butit is widespread in Africa, Asia, China and the Far East, and throughout theworld. Another ‘hot spot’ is the ‘royal families’ of Arabia. Credo Mutwa hastold me many times about the shocking number of children that go missing inSouthern Africa alone every year, and Chinese networks are apparently seriouslyinvolved in what happens to them. Belgium is a major global centre for childabuse and sacrifice, because Brussels is the headquarters of both the EuropeanUnion and NATO. This creates an insatiable demand for children in that country.One line of inquiry in the abduction of Madeleine McCann, the three-year-oldBritish girl abducted while on holiday in Portugal in 2007, was that apaedophile ring in Belgium had made an ‘order’ for a young girl three daysbefore she went missing. This was based on information that someone had taken aphotograph of Madeleine and sent it to Belgium. The ‘purchaser’ agreed that shewas ‘suitable’, and soon after she was never seen again. Children are stolen toorder and the blond-haired and blue-eyed attract the highest price. The horrificMarc Dutroux case in Belgium in the 1990s was connected to famous Satanists andpaedophiles. He kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused six girls aged betweeneight and nineteen. He murdered four of them. Police made a series of ‘errors’in their investigation of the girls’ disappearance that stopped Dutroux beingapprehended before the murders. Judge Jean-Marc Connerotte took charge of theinvestigation after Dutroux was arrested. Connerotte was a decent man and soughttenaciously to uncover what really happened. He began to make connections fromDutroux to the El-ite of Belgium, where, as in Britain, the German ‘royal’ houseof Saxe–Coburg–Gotha is on the throne. This German bloodline ‘house’ in all itsexpressions has just got to be covertly Rothschild. Judge Connerotte was gettingfar too close to the truth and he was sacked from the case by the very El-itewho stood to be exposed. 300,000 people took to the streets of Brussels inprotest. The ‘investigators’ that replaced him were obviously not going topursue the truth, and they didn’t. An ‘investigation’ by a Belgian parliamentarycommission decided that Dutroux was not connected to rich and famous figures inBelgium, as he claimed, including leading police chiefs and judges. It wasnonsense, of course. Dutroux supplied children to these people for sex andsacrifice.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00297.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00298.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00299.jpg]Figure 232: Naked children can be found in pictures around the Vatican City andin many paintings by famous artists--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00300.jpg] Figure 233: The Roman Church is a cesspit of paedophilia around the world Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00301.jpg] Figure 234: Paedophiles are possessed by entities that use them as a bridge tovampire the energy of children Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) Judge Connerotte’s experience was repeated on the El-ite stronghold of Jersey inthe Channel Islands when a detective genuinely went in search of the truth afterankle shackles, stocks and canes were found at the former children’s home calledHaut de la Garenne. A thousand vulnerable children lived there over the years.The detective was taken off the case and subjected to abuse and ridicule forcommitting the crime of doing a proper investigation. Children’s homes are aprime supplier of children to the paedophile and satanic rings. In 2011,WikiLeaks published US Embassy cables which revealed that children who had gonemissing from Irish state children’s homes had been found working as sex slavesin brothels. The cables said that the Irish authorities were not even keepingstatistics on the numbers. Child-kidnapping, murder and slavery is happening ona breathtaking scale and you can now see why. Thomas Hamilton, a paedophile andFreemason, shot dead 16 children and a teacher at the Dunblane primary school inScotland in 1996 before shooting himself. This case had the familiar police‘mistakes’ that allowed Hamilton to remain at large despite his well-knownpaedophilic activities, and to own firearms when he should not have qualified todo so. More than 100 documents relating to the case were ordered to be lockedaway for 100 years by the head of the ‘inquiry’, Lord Cullen. Neil Mackay, aproper journalist on the Scottish Sunday Herald, reported that the documentsbanned from public view included a letter sent by politician George Robertson toMichael Forsyth, the then Secretary of State for Scotland. Robertson would laterbe British Defence Secretary and Secretary General of NATO. Cullen said that thedocuments were locked away to protect children, but The Sunday Herald discoveredthat only a handful related to children or named alleged abuse victims.Paedophile and satanic rings operate within Freemasonry as a secret societywithin a secret society. Even some High Freemasons don’t know what is going on.Lord Burton, a former Scottish Freemasonic Grand Master, stated publicly thatthe official ‘inquiry’ into the Dunblane massacre, conducted by the Scot, LordCullen, was a cover-up. Lord Burton told the media that Cullen’s inquirysuppressed crucial information to protect high-profile legal figures thatbelonged to a ‘Super Mason’ group called the ‘Speculative Society’. He said: > I have learned of an apparent connection between prominent members of the> legal establishment involved in the inquiry, and the secretive Speculative> Society. The society was formed in Edinburgh University through Masonic> connections so I accept that there might be a link by that route. Members of the Speculative Society have included Lord Cullen himself and anumber of other judges, sheriffs and advocates. Lord Burton, of course, wassubjected to the usual dismissal, condemnation and threats for demanding action.The cover-up that Lord Burton exposes was to protect the famous dregs thatHamilton supplied with children. Scotland is home to the royal family estate atBalmoral Castle where they perform satanic rituals. The castle stands atop anunderground tunnel system where most of it goes on. Scotland has many more suchReptilian royal and aristocratic estates, and it is a global bastion forSatanism and paedophilia. They don’t call it the Scottish Rite of Freemasonryfor nothing. Satanism and paedophilia infest the Scottish police, judiciary (andlaw in general), politics and aristocracy (of course). The case involving HollieGreig, a young lady with Down’s syndrome, who claims, with supporting evidence,to have been serially-raped as a child over a decade by members of the Scottishestablishment – including a judge – has not been properly investigated by thissame establishment. The story has been given a lot of coverage in thealternative media and by a campaign called ‘Google Hollie Greig’, but themainstream media refused to touch it for years. The Scottish Sunday Express did,however, run a story in July 2011 about two Members of Parliament calling forthe case to be reinvestigated. Robert Green, the wonderful man who has beencampaigning for justice for Hollie, has been persecuted by the same Scottishestablishment in order to stop the truth from being exposed. Judge Jean-MarcConnerotte, the first investigating judge in the Dutroux case, described his ownexperience. He spoke of … > … the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect [me] against> the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out. Never before> in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been> subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had> been taken out against the magistrates … Rarely has so much energy been spent> opposing an inquiry. Connerotte said that much of the protection of suspects came from people ingovernment who should have been seeking the truth. One wing of the Illuminatiprotects another wing whenever necessary and Satanism and paedophilia are rifewithin global governments and politics, anyway. Incidentally, why are judges inservice to ‘the king’ and not the people? I exposed former British PrimeMinister, Ted Heath, as a serial paedophile and child killer in my book, TheBiggest Secret, in the late 1990s. No action was taken – because it was true.Conservative Party leader Heath was obsessed with satanic ritual and torturingand sacrificing children and so was his ‘opponent’, Labour Party Prime Minister,Harold Wilson. Either Heath or Wilson was British Prime Minister from 1964 to1976 – both high-level Satanists. I have been exposing Father George Bush as apaedophile, serial killer and torturer of children since before Heath. One ofBush’s endless victims was the daughter of Cathy O’Brien, who I mentionedearlier with regard to shapeshifting Father Bush. Her book, Trance-Formation ofAmerica, exposes the evil and sickening activities of people like Bush, DickCheney and Bill and Hillary Clinton, among many others. The Bushes(‘Republicans’) and the Clintons (‘Democrats’) are supposed to be political‘opponents’, but they are part of the same ‘team’. They ran drugs togetherthrough the Mena airstrip in Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor (see:… Andthe Truth Shall Set You Free). The bloodlines own the global drug trade andthat’s why the trillions of dollars spent funding the ‘war on drugs’ has neverachieved anything. It’s not meant to. Opium production has soared in Afghanistansince the American and British invasion in 2001. Afghanistan is now the biggestopium producer on the planet and is responsible for 92 per cent of illicit opiumproduction worldwide, with 12 per cent of the population involved in opium poppyproduction. Cathy O’Brien saw at close hand the drug activities of the Clintonsand Bushes and Father George’s serial paedophilia. Cathy wrote the following inher book about what he did to her daughter, Kelly, who was born in ‘captivity’: > Kelly became violently physically ill after her induction into George Bush’s> ‘neighborhood’ and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter.> She ran 104-6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilising headaches> for an average of three days [consistent with high voltage trauma] … Houston> [Cathy’s forced-upon-her ‘husband’] forbade me to call a doctor, and Kelly> forbade me to comfort her, pitifully complaining that her head ‘hurt too bad> even to move’. And she did not move for hours on end. Kelly often complained> of severe kidney pain and her rectum usually bled for a day or so after Bush> sexually abused her. My own mind control victimisation rendered me unable to> help or protect her. Seeing my child in such horrible condition drove my own> wedge of insanity in deeper … > … Kelly’s bleeding rectum was but one of many physical indicators of George> Bush’s pedophile perversions. I have overheard him speak blatantly of his> sexual abuse of her on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to> ‘pull my strings’ and control me. The psychological ramifications of being> raped by a pedophile President are mind shattering enough, but reportedly Bush> further reinforced the traumas to Kelly’s mind with sophisticated NASA> electronic and drug mind-control devices. > Bush also instilled the ‘Who ya gonna call?’ and ‘I’ll be watching you’ binds> on Kelly, further reinforcing her state of helplessness. The systematic> tortures and trauma that I endured as a child now seem trite in comparison to> the brutal physical and psychological devastation that George Bush inflicted> on my daughter. How could anyone do this? No empathy. I talked about Bush’s paedophilicactivities in a live BBC Radio interview with host, now actor, Russell Brand,and the idiot media just reported what I said with the usual approach that‘David Icke is mad’. Yawn. The Australian Satanist that I quoted earlier withregard to the manipulation of the ‘morphic field’ also talked about the waypoliticians are drawn into child sexual abuse: > Politicians are introduced by a carefully graded set of criteria and> situations that enable them to accept that their victims will be ‘Our little> secret’. Young children sexually molested and physically abused by politicians> worldwide are quickly used as sacrifices. In Australia, the bodies are hardly> ever discovered, for Australia is still a wilderness. How could anyone do this? No empathy. They comply with the definition of‘soulless’: (1) lacking any humanising qualities or influences; dead; mechanicalsoulless work; (2) (of a person) lacking in sensitivity or nobility; (3)heartless; cruel; (4) lacking sensitivity or the capacity for deep feeling.These people are not like most of the rest of us and we need to understand thatpretty damn quickly. ‘They’ wouldn’t do that? No, you wouldn’t do that. ‘They’are doing it. Actor Corey Feldman, a one-time child star, told ABC’s Nightlineprogramme in 2011 that Hollywood was awash with paedophiles preying on childactors and others. He said paedophiles were ‘like vultures’ in the entertainmentindustry and the ‘casting couch’ even applied to children. ‘It’s all done underthe radar,’ he said. ‘But it’s the big secret.’ Here you have the real storybehind moves to make paedophilia legal. Yes, I really said that. TheInternational Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) is advocating the ‘right’ toconsent to sex acts be included in the United Nations ‘Rights of the Child’Treaty, which is nothing to do with giving rights to children; it is abouttaking away parental rights over what happens to their children. The IPPF isfunded by governments, trusts, and foundations, the European Commission and theUnited Nations Population Fund for special projects. It is a major lobby groupin the European Union and here it is advocating sexual freedom for children –the freedom of adults to sexually abuse children, in effect, under the cover of‘consent’. The organisation has a sexual rights guide called Exclaim! whichAmanda Pawloski at LifeNews.com [http://lifenews.com] said calls for ‘acornucopia of sexuality and gender protections and entitlements under the guiseof international law’. LifeNews also revealed that the IPPE was allowed todistribute a brochure entitled ‘Healthy, Happy and Hot’ at a no-adults-welcomepanel at the United Nations hosted by the World Association of Girl Scouts andGirl Guides. There is a major push going on to sexualize children to provide anendless supply of children for the sicker than sick while removing the power ofparents to intervene.SOCIAL SERVICES (SS) MAFIAThere is another crucial aspect to this and that is the ‘Social Services’,‘Family Services’ or ‘Child Protection Services’. These have largely beeninfiltrated by the bloodline satanic and paedophile rings to ensure an endlessflow of children, and to block any chance of a child’s claims of abuse bymembers of the El-ite from coming out or being investigated. These organisationsare supposed to be there – officially at least – to protect the vulnerable,especially children, but the truth is that they have become vehicles forstealing children from their parents for no other reason than to provide alimitless supply for the Satanists and paedophiles. Many are stolen to order. Achild in a community will be identified and put on the ‘wanted list’ and thenSocial Services will invent a reason to take the little boy or girl from theirparents and hand them to foster parents and adoptive parents who are connectedto the rings. American Child ‘Protective’ Services (CPS) employs privatecompanies to steal children on the State’s behalf, and there is a massivefinancial incentive for these companies and CPS to kidnap children and sell theminto child trafficking, paedophile and Satanist networks. That does not meanthat all foster and adoptive parents are paedophiles and Satanists, of course;the great majority are not. But a highly significant number are. This is why thefigures for stealing children from their parents on ludicrous grounds and inoutrageous circumstances of cruelty and injustice are soaring across the world.‘Family Courts’ that make these decisions on the say-so of corrupt socialworkers, police, lawyers and judges (often connected by the same rings) are heldin secret for the same reason. The authorities claim that the secrecy is to‘protect the child’ when it is really to protect the Satanists and paedophiles,and the system itself, from public exposure. Corrupt is hardly a word that willin any way suffice. Anyone with a functioning mind must know that the ‘legalsystem’ worldwide is corrupt to its core. Why would the bloodlines that controlit want to dispense justice? The bloodlines not only own the legal system, theycreated it to serve their interests. But the secret Family Courts are evenbeyond the normal level of corruption, because children are involved that theyare desperate to acquire. Satanic and paedophile social workers, policeofficers, lawyers and judges conspire together to remove children from lovingparents to feed their insatiable rings and ringmasters. Evidence is fabricatedby social workers and police, and ‘judgements’ are clearly written by manyjudges before a hearing is even finished – often even started. To part littlechildren coldly and knowingly from loving parents, and to part brothers andsisters from each other, requires a level of soulless, heartless inhumanity thatis beyond my imagination. But this is the norm for these ‘people’. It is whatthey are. The Family Court system, from social workers through to police andjudges, is awash with this mentality. The secrecy means that the horrifichappenings fly under the radar of most people, and once they secure the majorpositions in any organisation – the hire and fire positions – they can simplyand quickly appoint ‘their own’ at all levels (Fig 235[../Text/index_split_104.html#filepos838147]). Anyone who won’t play ball, orcould be a source of exposure, is simply denied promotion, often hounded andharassed until they leave. Satanists and paedophiles have, in this way, largelytaken over. They dominate the upper echelons of the police, Social Services,legal profession, judiciary and government. And many of the lower levels, too."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00302.jpg] Figure 235: The compartmentalised structure that protects El-ite paedophiles andSatanists from public attention Child ‘protection’ services are given big financial incentives by governments tomeet targets for removing children from parents, and gutless social workers whoare not directly part of the paedophile and satanic networks often lie and cheatto meet the targets under pressure from their ‘superiors’. Either way, theoutcome is the same: devastated parents, devastated children and families tornapart. ‘Shapeshifter’ Tony Blair ran a ‘personal crusade’ when he was Britishprime minister to vastly increase the number of children taken from theirparents. This included setting targets for councils for the number of forcedadoptions each year. A man so utterly connected to the bloodline cabal does thiswhen the bloodlines have an insatiable desire for children – can this be just aanother coincidence? Of course not. The numbers are now at an all-time record inBritain with some 10,000 children a year removed from their families by theState. I have been investigating these subjects for well over a decade and thereis no doubt that the Social Services system becomes more arrogant and blatant bythe day – there are so many cases that it’s not possible to keep track of themall. The vast majority never come to public attention anyway because of theenforced secrecy and the fact that parents are threatened with going to prisonif they say publicly that their children have been stolen by the State. This ishappening. NOW. The stories are as harrowing and traumatic as they are nowendless, with thousands of parents every year in Britain unjustly accused ofabuse or being unable to care for their children. They are told that if theychallenge the decision of the Social Services (SS) Mafia to take away theirchildren they will never see them again, even in rare ‘supervised’ visits. Theyare also told that it will be bad for their case if they speak publicly aboutwhat has happened when, in truth, the outcome has been decided from the start.Of course, genuinely abused and neglected children have to be removed from thatsituation, but this is not what we are talking about here. Loving and dotingparents are being parted from their very well cared for children. Publicawareness of what is going on is also increasing, thank goodness, though notfast enough. Investigative journalist, Christopher Booker, who writes forLondon’s Sunday Telegraph, has been trying to expose the horrors perpetrated bySocial Services and the secret Family Court system, but like all of the media heis limited in what he can say by draconian reporting restrictions. He tells ofone case in which a woman was still giving birth when five policemen and twosocial workers – five policemen – walked in to seize the baby virtually from themother’s womb. Do these people continue to call themselves human? Do theycontinue to believe they are connected to anything remotely resembling a soul?If so, they are deluding themselves. Oh, they will say, we were only followingorders; but isn’t that what they said at Nuremburg? Try following what passesfor your heart, chaps. They ‘follow orders’ because they have got balls the sizeof peanuts and a heart to match. How they can look into their own children’seyes and do this, I’ll never know. Thousands of children are taken unjustly fromtheir parents every year in Britain alone, so imagine the number across theworld. It is done by accusing them (without evidence) of abusing their children,or of being unfit to be parents citing psychological problems that don’t exist.Social Services even have ‘on call’ psychiatrists to give them the verdict theywant.SICK IS NOT THE WORDOne British father, Mark Harris, was jailed for four months by a Family Courtjudge (see under moron) for waving to his children as they went past in a carafter the court had denied this loving father any access to them whatsoever. Hewas later sent to prison for 10 months for driving past his children’s homehoping to catch a glimpse of them. The charge was ‘contempt of court’, but howcan you be in contempt of a court that is so contemptuous? Mark went through 133court appearances, 33 different judges, two prison sentences and a hunger strikebefore he was allowed to see his children again. As he said: ‘They took mydaughter’s childhood, her formative years, from me. Lisa is 20 now. I didn’t seeher between the ages of 10 and 16. An awful lot happens in a child’s life inthat time, and I missed it all.’ His children didn’t even know why their fatherdid not come to see them. This is how sick it all is. Another mother was jailedafter telling her son that she loved him when she saw him in the street, and shewas then arrested and taken before the courts again for posting a video on theInternet telling her story. One case I followed closely was that of MaureenSpalek who had her three children stolen by the State many years ago inLiverpool in the North West of England. She was then subjected to disgracefulpersecution and harassment by the, well, disgraceful Merseyside police andSocial Services. Maureen was arrested and taken to court for the ‘crime’ ofsending one of her children a birthday card to their new home imposed on them bythose who steal children for a living. She was also flagged down by an unmarkedpolice car on the outskirts of the town where two of her children live with anadoptive mother. Her car was seized and she was arrested, handcuffed and held ina police cell until lunchtime the next day. The police alleged that she was inbreach of a court order forbidding her to enter the town. Later she was heldagain at the Merseyside Police Belle Vale Custody Suite in Liverpool after beingarrested for sending a text to someone. She said the text was not in the leastthreatening or rude. The custody suite sergeant said that after she had sent thetext, and had been given a police warning for it, a complaint had been madeagainst her for harassment. These people are very, very sick. The police wouldnot reveal who authorised the arrest and the custody suite sergeant put thephone down when questioned. No doubt he then went home to his children. Theauthorities appeared to be very worried about Maureen Spalek, and some wouldsuspect that this is connected in part with activities at Liverpool’s notoriousAlder Hey Children’s Hospital. Alder Hey was exposed for unauthorised removal,retention and disposal (where?) of children’s organs and other human tissue keptin more than 2,000 pots containing body parts from some 850 infants. MaureenSpalek has discovered that her children have been taken to Alder Hey forappointments, although they were not ill. So what were they doing there? Iposted news of her arrest on my website and invited people to ring theMerseyside police to tell them what they thought of their treatment of thislady. So many did so that they crashed the police telephone system and she wasreleased with the charges dropped. ‘You seem to have a lot of friends,’ a policeofficer told her. It shows what can be done if enough people are committed tothe cause of freedom, fairness and justice for all.This is what we need – commitment to these values and the focus anddetermination to do what is necessary to express them. We have a tiny tailcurrently wagging a massive dog, and only when the dog starts to wake up andbark can this situation end. People would be shocked if what I have describedwas happening in an officially totalitarian country; but this is now a commondaily experience in ‘free’ Britain, ‘free’ America and other countries that lieand posture about being ‘free’ and ‘democratic’. Most people think that thenumber of missing children can be gauged by how many times they see missingchildren stories in the media; but that is a fraction of a fraction of afraction of the number involved. Many of them end up in the child traffickingrings ultimately controlled by the bloodlines which abduct children both enmasse and to order, with a specific child with specific genetic traits targetedon behalf of a ‘client’. Many of these end up in the Middle East, not leastSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but they are also sold to buyers allover the world."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00303.jpg] Figure 236: Full-body scanners – a paedophile’s dream. Ain’t that right, Henry? Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) The bloodline network is obsessed with children, and I have explained here whythat is the case. Children are now constantly photographed naked or sexuallymolested in increasing numbers of airports as they pass through ‘security’ (Fig236). This won’t encourage paedophiles to suddenly develop a passion for thesecurity profession, will it? Incredible. The number of paedophiles beingemployed is increasing with the expansion of this system and the whole processis conditioning children to accept molestation as ‘part of life’. If anyone elsedid what these people in uniform do to children they would be arrested and thekey thrown away. What are we doing accepting the abuse of our own children?Enough, enough, enough."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00304.jpg] Another fundamental presence that pervades the entire Illuminati web – another‘cement’ – is what I call ‘Rothschild’ Zionism. I add the ‘Rothschild’ toconstantly emphasise the true creators of Zionism and its controllers to thisday. ‘Zion’ is code for ‘Saturn’. Zionism is Saturnism in the same way thatSatanism is Saturnism (Fig 237). It is another face of the Saturn Cult, but mostof its supporters and advocates won’t know that.I summarised earlier some of the historical background, and I expose RothschildZionism in great detail in Human Race Get Off Your Knees and The David IckeGuide to the Global Conspiracy. Most researchers either don’t realise theoverwhelming significance of this network or they are too frightened to say so.Sod that! Ask most people about Zionism and they will say, ‘That’s the Jews.’The Rothschild networks in politics and the media have very successfully ‘sold’this impression – this image – as ‘common knowledge’ and ‘everyone knows that’.But it’s not true. The terms ‘Jewish people’ and ‘Zionism’ are notinterchangeable as we are led to believe. Many Jews vehemently oppose Zionism,and many Zionists are not Jewish. Rothschild Zionism in its public expression isa political ideology based on a homeland for Jewish people in Palestine, and abelief that the Jews are God’s ‘chosen race’ with a God-given right to the‘promised land’ of Israel (historically this is nonsense, as I explainedearlier). They also believe that the real borders of Israel must encompass whatis now Israel, including Gaza and the West Bank which are still officially ownedby the Palestinians; plus Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Jordan, or, as Genesisputs it: ‘… from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates’. This is the public faceof Zionism, but at its core it is a premier secret society within the hiddencontrol structure. Zionism was created by (and is still controlled by) the Houseof Rothschild, and they have sought to program the belief that‘Zionism-means-all-Jewish-people’ so that they can condemn as ‘anti-Semites’ and‘racists’ anyone who exposes the truth about the Rothschilds and their agents ingovernment, banking, business, media and military, etc. This is why mostresearchers won’t go there, even if they are aware enough to know that theyshould go there. We need all the ‘B’s’ to uncover and expose what is happeningin the world – brain, backbone and balls. Never more so than now. AddConsciousness to the essential requirements if you want to see how deep therabbit hole really goes. Racism is extreme ignorance in that it relates ‘self’to the body, instead of Consciousness – Awareness – animating and experiencingthrough the body. Racism is like judging a man by his spacesuit instead of theperson inside. Racists are ridiculous, juvenile and silly, but no way is thethreat of being branded as one (they have already tried and failed) going tostop me from exposing what must be exposed if the Control System is going tofall. The world’s most extreme racists are, after all, Rothschild Zionists,anyway. One of its most shocking expressions, an extreme of an extreme, is aJewish supremacist organisation called Chabad Lubavitch. This has widespreadconnections to governments all over the world. Chabad Lubavitch was founded inthe 18th century and its most celebrated leader was Menachem Mendel Schneerson,or the ‘Great Rebbe’, who died in 1994 (Fig 238[../Text/index_split_107.html#filepos854697]). He wrote that ‘two contrary typesof soul exist; a non-Jewish soul came from three satanic spheres, while theJewish soul stems from holiness’. ‘A Jew was not created as a means for some[other] purpose,’ he said. The substance of all divine emanations was createdonly to serve the Jews and, therefore, ‘the Jew himself is the purpose’. The USCongress voted unanimously to give the Congressional Gold Medal to Schneerson, aman who preached that all Gentiles are innately evil and genetically inferior.But isn’t that what the Reptilian hybrid bloodlines have always believed? Ithink it is, you know. What a coincidence. What have we come to when they give aCongressional Medal to someone who preached that non-Jews are only here to serveJews? Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh, a leading Chabad Rabbi, believes that a Jewshould be able to take the organs of Gentiles, because non-Jews are geneticallyinferior. He wrote the following in The Jewish Weekly, about the founder ofChabad Lubavitch, Schneur Zalman:image [../Images/00305.jpg] Figure 237: The web of Saturnism Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00306.jpg] Figure 238: The ‘Great Rebbe’. Lovely chap > As for the goyim [non-Jews] … Zalman’s attitude (was): ‘Gentile souls are of a> completely different and inferior order. They are totally evil, with no> redeeming qualities whatsoever.’ If every single cell in a Jewish body entails> divinity, is a part of God, then every strand of DNA is a part of God.> Therefore, something is special about Jewish DNA. If a Jew needs a liver, can> you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to save him? The Torah> would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite value. Can you imagine what would happen if a non-Jew had said a fraction of that inrelation to being white or black or Chinese? Chabad Rabbi Manis Friedman wasreported in Jewish publications to have said this in reply to a question abouthow he thought Jews should treat their Arab neighbours: ‘The only way to fight amoral war is the Jewish way: destroy their holy sites. Kill men, women andchildren (and cattle).’ I know it must be almost impossible to believe, butthese really are the same people that go around shouting ‘racist’ at others.Many of the political ‘Left’ (brain) have been helping them to do this decadeafter decade by branding those who challenge Rothschild Zionism as racist. Theyhave also sought, often successfully, to deny them the right to speak in publicwhen they are only trying to alert the world to what is going on. This happenedto me years ago, particularly in Rothschild Zionist-controlled Canada, where oneof the ringleaders was the serial litigator and government employee calledRichard Warman. You can see him at work trying to have my event banned inVancouver if you put the words: ‘David Icke, the Lizards and the Jews’ intoYouTube. You will also have the pleasure of seeing the most classic example ofthe ‘Left’ mentality that I am talking about here. Quite a number were involvedbut, even collectively, there was no discernable brain cell activity that couldbe measured by any known technology. They threw cream pies at me during a booksigning, but missed, except for a dab on the arm, and they hit the children’sbook section instead. Bless ‘em. I blame their mothers. You can see how this guyRichard Warman gives them the pie idea in the YouTube video. Funny how theynever seem to question or challenge the racism of Israel which is an apartheidstate every bit as much as were apartheid South Africa and apartheid America. Idon’t just mean the evil that is inflicted upon the Palestinian peopleminute-by-minute, day-by-day. I include the extraordinary racist divisionswithin the fiercely hierarchical Israeli society in which black Jews fromEthiopia, for example, are considered little more than vermin. I never onceheard any of these ‘look at me; I’m so pure’ left-brain-imprisoned‘anti-racists’ mention this. But I feel sorry for them, really. Think how theymust feel when they wake up every morning and realise that they are still them.Wow! Let’s move on.We need to go beyond the calculated diversion that equates challengingRothschild Zionism and the horrors of Israel with being anti-Jewish. Then we canlook instead at the simple facts that the Rothschild networks don’t want you toknow. Firstly, you don’t have to be Jewish to be a Rothschild Zionist. US VicePresident, Joe Biden, said this publicly while arse-licking his masters in TelAviv (ultimately his masters at Chateau Rothschild). Some of the most vehementRothschild Zionists are the Christian Zionists in the United States andelsewhere. These are led most vocally by their ‘spiritual’ leader, John C Hagee.Think of the worst kind of extreme bible-bashing hypocrite and you’ve got him toa T. He says that what Hitler and the Nazis did to the Jews was the fulfilmentof ‘God’s will for Israel’. Get yourself a cup of sweet tea before reading whathe said: > Theodor Hertzl [Rothschild frontman] is the Father of Zionism. He was a Jew> and at the turn of the 19th century said: ‘This land is our land; God wants us> to live there.’ So he went to the Jews of Europe and said: ‘I want you to come> and join me in the land of Israel.’ So few came and Hertzl went into> depression. Those who came founded Israel. Those who did not went through the> hell of the Holocaust. Then God sent a hunter. A hunter is someone who comes> with a gun and he forces you. Hitler was a hunter. Unbelievable. Hitler and the Nazis were actually sent by the Rothschilds andRockefellers to, in part, force Jews to go where the overwhelming majority didnot want to go – Israel. The first Rothschild Zionist Congress in 1897 was heldin in Basel, Switzerland, because it had to be moved from the original location,Munich, Germany, in the face of opposition from Jews who did not support theZionist plan to move them all to Israel. Then along came the Nazis and the restis history. Theodor Herzl wrote in his diary: > It is essential that the sufferings of Jews … become worse … this will assist> in realization of our plans … I have an excellent idea … I shall induce> anti-Semites to liquidate Jewish wealth … The anti-Semites will assist us> thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews.> The anti-Semites shall be our best friends. Rothschild Zionism wants what is best for Jewish people? Sure they do. JohnHagee is the founder and National Chairman of the Christian-Zionistorganisation, Christians United for Israel. He’s a regular visitor to Israel andhas met every prime minister since Menachem Begin. His John Hagee Ministries hasgiven more than $8.5 million to relocate Jews from the former Soviet Union toIsrael, and he is the founder and executive director of an event called ‘A Nightto Honor Israel’. This pledges solidarity between Christians and the State ofIsrael. By contrast, a large number of Jewish people are not Zionists. Manyoppose it and support the Palestinians in their battle for survival against theonslaught of genocide from the Israeli government and military funded by theRothschild Zionist-owned United States. Jewish people organise protests and callfor boycotts of Israel in response to the Rothschild Zionist agenda for thePalestinians (Fig 239). But how many people who glean their ‘information’ fromthe mainstream media know this? How many people know, as portrayed in Figure 240[../Text/index_split_108.html#filepos864054], that many religious Jews abhor thedemands by the Rothschild Zionists for a US attack on Iran and have had warmmeetings with Iran’s President Ahmadinejad to give their support? Noone who getstheir ‘news’ solely from the Rothschild Zionist-controlled mainstream mediawould know any of this. It pushes only one line – Zionism means all Jewishpeople, end of story. Anyone who believes that should read the work of themagnificent Jewish writer, Norman Finkelstein, whose parents suffered in Naziconcentration camps; and that of Jewish musician and writer, Gilad Atzmon, at:www.gilad.co.uk [http://www.gilad.co.uk]. The Rothschilds have a network oforganisations, including B’nai B’rith and its offshoot, the Anti-DefamationLeague (ADL), which works with other Rothschild-controlled groups to targetanyone who gets close to seeing the elephant in the living room. They attack andundermine them in every way they can to stop the simple and devastating truthcoming to light – that the Rothschilds and agents of the Rothschild Zionistsecret-society control governments, not least in Britain and the United States;global finance and commerce; the mainstream media; Hollywood; and the musicindustry. Even this is only a partial list of their empire.image [../Images/00307.jpg] Figure 239: The belief that Rothschild Zionism is the same as ‘Jewish people’ isa manipulated myth "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00308.jpg] Figure 240: All Jews are Rothschild Zionists? THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILDMayer Amschel Rothschild (born 1744), the son of a money changer, founded thedynasty in Frankfurt, Germany. The family had formerly been known as ‘Bauer’.Mayer Rothschild developed a close and very profitable relationship with Germanroyalty, most notably Prince William of Hesse–Hanau. British and Belgian royaltyare both really the German House of Saxe–Coburg–Gotha and there is no way thatthis is a coincidence, or that this same bloodline has connections to othersurviving royal families in Europe. Rothschild genetics has to be involvedsomewhere. Many of the most prominent Rothschild Zionist banking families inAmerica, including Goldman, Sachs, Lazard and Lehman, also originate from theRothschild stronghold of Germany. Mayer Rothschild sent his sons to London,Paris, Naples and Vienna to expand the empire and soon it was controlling thefinances of Europe, and later the world. The Rothschilds were well known forarranged marriages with family members, such as first and second cousins. Theofficial biographies say this was to keep the money in the family, but geneticswas equally important. A major Rothschild modus operandi has been to covertlyengineer wars and lend all sides the credit ‘money’ to fight them. They advancemore credit ‘money’ for the warring countries to rebuild their devastatedinfrastructure and economies when the conflict ends before doing the same allover again. They have seized ownership of these countries through debt. Israeliwriter and researcher, Barry Chamish, reported a meeting he had with a grandsonof Sir Evelyn de Rothschild during the Israel–Lebanon war in 2006. The grandsonsaid that he had abandoned the family to become a Mormon. There was some ironyin this when you think that the Mormon Church and the Watchtower Society, orJehovah’s Witnesses, were both funded into existence by the Rothschilds andremain Rothschild Zionist front organisations today. Both of these religions arepledged to introduce a ‘New Jerusalem’ called ‘Zion’. Mormon founders, JosephSmith, Hiram Smith and Brigham Young were bloodline Freemasons, and theyincluded many Freemasonic concepts in Mormon belief and ritual. Charles TazeRussell and Joseph Franklin Rutherford who established the Watchtower Societywere also Freemasons and Rothschild lackeys. Both ‘religions’ are fronts forSatanism at their inner core. I have spoken at length with many women whodescribed how they were raped and impregnated during satanic rituals involvingreptilian entities on an altar under the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City. Theresulting foetuses were later used in horrific rituals such as those thatStewart Swerdlow described earlier. The Rothschild grandson told Chamish thatjust seven families were enjoying the ‘fruits of the war’ in Lebanon at thetime. He said of the Rothschilds: ‘They created Israel as their personal toy. Itmakes them richer and gives them more control.’ I have been saying and writingfor nearly 20 years that the Rothschilds own Israel, and anything Israel does isthe Rothschilds at work. The Rothschilds built the Israeli parliament, theKnesset and the Supreme Court building with all its occult symbols."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00309.jpg] Figure 241: Sir Evelyn de Rothschild "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00310.jpg] Figure 242: Jacob Rothschild There are Rothschild family branches in Britain, Germany, France, Austria, Italyand Switzerland and they operate through many and various names throughout theworld. Wherever there is money and manipulation you will find a Rothschild. TheNaples branch of the family in Italy has long had a close association with theRoman Church, which I’m sure will surprise no-one. Among the most prominentmembers of the dynasty are Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, a financial advisor toQueen Elizabeth II and the Vatican, and governor of the London School ofEconomics; and financier Jacob Rothschild – 4th Baron Rothschild, a close friendand business associate of Henry Kissinger (Figs 241[../Text/index_split_109.html#filepos867874] and 242). You would expect aRothschild to be involved with the Illuminati-created-and-controlled LondonSchool of Economics where many agents and players in the game are ‘educated’.I’ll say more about this later. Jacob Rothschild is also a close friend andassociate of Rothschild Zionist media tycoon, Rupert Murdoch, and deputychairman of the satellite television network, BskyB, in which Murdoch has themajor stake. The connection to Murdoch is a gimme. No one builds a media empire,or any other, unless the Rothschild networks are behind it somewhere. Murdochwas forced to close his sleazy UK tabloid, the News of the World, in 2011 afterit was exposed for tapping the phones of thousands of people, ‘celebrities’, andeven the families of dead soldiers and murdered children. They were also bribingequally corrupt London Metropolitan police officers with tens of thousands ofpounds for what should have been confidential information. Sir Paul Stephenson,the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, resigned after it was revealed that heemployed as his ‘personal advisor’ a former News of the World deputy editorarrested on suspicion of phone hacking. Rupert Murdoch, the Rothschildpropaganda chief, was responsible for ‘shapeshifter’ Tony Blair being El-ectedand we now know that the two met three times in the nine days before theinvasion of Iraq in 2003. Every one of Murdoch’s 127 newspapers worldwidesupported the invasion. When the News of the World scandal broke it was revealedthat David Cameron met Murdoch executives no fewer than 26 times in the littlemore than a year before he became Prime Minister in 2010. Another 27 meetingsfollowed in his first year as head of the UK government. Defence Secretary LiamFox gave confidential defence briefings to Murdoch executives; and GeorgeOsborne, the Rothschild-controlled Chancellor of the Exchequer, had 16 separatemeetings with Murdoch editors and executives in his first year in office.Cameron also appointed former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as DowningStreet director of communications before Coulson resigned over the phone-tappingscandal. Sean Hoare, a former News of the World reporter, was found dead at hishome in Watford, north of London, when the main scandal broke. He had gonepublic the year before to say that Coulson knew about the hacking which was‘endemic’ and part of the ‘culture at [Rupert Murdoch’s] News International’. Hesaid that it was happening on an ‘industrial scale’. Police said that Hoare’sdeath was ‘unexplained, but not thought to be suspicious’. This extraordinarystatement was made before any investigation or post mortem. His death meant thathis evidence would never be heard by any inquiry or any subsequent criminalinvestigation. How convenient. As I write, the FBI is investigating allegationsthat Murdoch employees hacked the phones of the families of 9/11 victims, which,if proven, could have serious implications for Murdoch’s American holdings,including Fox News, the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal. All thisprovided a glimpse, but only a glimpse, under the stone that the Rothschildscall home. I emphasise that when I refer to ‘the Rothschilds’ I mean thebloodline under endless different names and not only ‘Rothschild’. There arealso many people called Rothschild that have nothing to do with the manipulatingcentre of the family, or have no direct connection to the family except sharingthe same name.ROTHSCHILD WARS AND ‘REVOLUTIONS’The Rothschilds were the prime manipulating force behind the two world wars.They controlled and funded all sides in both of them – including the Nazis inWorld War II. Why would a supposedly ‘Jewish’ family bring to power people whohad such hatred for Jews? Simple: they don’t give a shit about Jewish people.They are just a means to an end to them. There were many Rothschild Zionistsamong the key Nazis and their funders. Max Warburg (Rothschild Zionist) was adirector of IG Farben, which funded Hitler and ran the concentration camp atAuschwitz. His brother, Paul Warburg (Rothschild Zionist), was a director of theAmerican end of IG Farben and was also instrumental in the creation of theFederal Reserve banking system which has controlled the United States economyever since it was established in 1913. Max Warburg signed the documentappointing Hjalmar Schacht to take control of the German central bank, theReichsbank. Warburg’s signature appears beside that of Adolf Hitler. AlfredRosenberg, one of the most influential authors of Nazi race policy, was Jewish,and there were many other Rothschild agents like him directing the horrors thatthe Nazis inflicted on Germany and the rest of Europe. (See: … And the TruthShall Set You Free). I have already noted that the Nazis were funded by theRothschild Zionist Rockefeller dynasty and the Harriman and Bush families, andthat the Rockefellers provided the money for the work of the Nazi ‘race purity’guru, Ernst Rudin. J.P. Morgan interests, General Electric, Standard Oil,National City Bank, Chase and Manhattan banks, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., General Motors,Ford, and others, funded the Nazi war machine. This is how Germany was able togo so quickly from the depths of economic collapse to declaring war on much ofEurope. A major conduit for this money was the Mendelsohn Bank of Amsterdam,officially controlled by the Warburg family (the Rothschilds, in truth), and theJ. Henry Schroder Bank in Frankfurt, London and New York. Legal work for theSchroder Bank was handled by an American law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Thesenior partners of Sullivan & Cromwell were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles(Rothschild Zionists) who became the US Secretary of State and the firstcivilian Director of the CIA respectively after the war. The Rothschildscontrolled Stalin (Rothschild Zionist) in Russia, Winston Churchill (RothschildZionist) in Britain and Franklin Roosevelt (Rothschild Zionist) in the UnitedStates. Stalin was Jewish, and so was Churchill. Moshe Kohn wrote in TheJerusalem Post in 1993: ‘Cunning, no doubt, came to Churchill in the Jewishgenes transmitted by his mother, Lady Randolph Churchill, née JennyJacobson/Jerome.’ The name ‘Roosevelt’ was formerly ‘Rosenfelt’, a Dutch Jewishfamily who, like many Jewish families, including the Rockefellers(Rockenfelder), changed their names to hide their origins when they moved toAmerica. The Rothschilds were the conductors of the orchestra in ‘Operation NaziSlaughter’. They wanted German Jews to be treated grotesquely by the Nazis tomanipulate both them and world opinion to support a new ‘Jewish homeland’ thatthe Rothschilds had long planned in Israel.The Rothschilds were the architects of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in1917 led by Yiddish-speaking Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (Rothschild Zionist, realname: Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov) and Leon Trotsky (Rothschild Zionist, real name:Lev Bronstein). These guys were frontmen for the House of Rothschild, and sowere their fellow ‘revolutionaries’, Grigory Zinoviev (Rothschild Zionist), LevKamenev (Rothschild Zionist) and Yakov Sverdlov (Rothschild Zionist). The‘Russian’ Revolution was the Rothschild Revolution. They provided the fundingthrough Kuhn, Loeb & Co., one of their American banks run by German Jews, JacobSchiff and Paul ‘Federal Reserve’ Warburg. Jacob Schiff created the Round Tablesatellite, the Council on Foreign Relations, in 1921. Schiff was thebrother-in-law of Warburg’s wife and when you follow these families you see thatthey interbreed just as much as any royal dynasty. They think they are a royaldynasty. The Schiff family are assets of the Rothschilds, and Jacob Schiff wasborn at the Rothschild house in Frankfurt with the ‘red sign’, or six-pointedstar (Saturn), over the entrance door. Al Gore’s daughter, now Karenna GoreSchiff, married a descendent of Jacob Schiff. Would a Schiff marry someone notof Jewish (Khazar) ancestry? I would be very surprised. Soviet dissident,Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who wrote The Gulag Archipelago, said: ‘The Bolshevikswere led by non-Russian people who hated the Russian people.’ They hatedeveryone. Hate is their emotional currency. They would murder 60 millionChristians and non-Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union. Solzhenitsyn wrote thatRothschild Zionists established and administered the Soviet concentration campsin which tens of millions died. The Red Army, the biggest killing machine inknown human history, was the creation of Rothschild Zionists. Leon Trotsky(Rothschild Zionist) was the head of the Red Army, and the leadingadministrators were Aron Solts (Rothschild Zionist); Yakov Rappoport (RothschildZionist); Lazar Kogan (Rothschild Zionist); Matvei Berman (Rothschild Zionist);Genrikh Yagoda (Rothschild Zionist); and Naftaly Frenkel (Rothschild Zionist).The Red Army killed almost seven million Germans, and millions more acrossEurope. Red Army soldiers killed and tortured civilians wherever they went andwere ordered to do so by their Rothschild leadership. They raped some twomillion German women and many more in Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria,Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. They also raped women – most of themJewish – who had been freed from Nazi concentration camps. The Red Army went onto terrorise Eastern Europe for decades. Ilya Ehrenburg (Rothschild Zionist) wasthe evil Soviet propagandist who distributed pamphlets ordering the Red Army torape, torture and kill their millions of victims. Ehrenburg told them: > If your part of the front is quiet and there is no fighting, then kill a> German in the meantime … if you have already killed a German, then kill> another – there is nothing more amusing to us than a heap of German corpses. > Kill! Kill! In the German race there is nothing but evil; not one among the> living, not one among the yet unborn but is evil! Follow the precepts of> Comrade Stalin. Stamp out the fascist beast once and for all in its lair! Use> force and break the racial pride of these German women. Take them as your> lawful booty. Kill! As you storm onward, kill, you gallant soldiers of the Red> Army. Nice man. The Red Army took Ehrenburg at his word, and this is how one youngRussian officer described what happened day after day after day: > Women, mothers and their children lie to the right and left along the route> and in front of each of them stands a raucous armada of men with their> trousers down. The women, who are bleeding or losing consciousness, get shoved> to one side and our men shoot the ones who try to save their children. Ilya Ehrenburg is celebrated by Rothschild Zionists as a Jewish hero of theRussian Revolution and he is honoured in Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust historymuseum. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told Russia’s Vladimir Putinin 2011 that a memorial was going to be erected in Israel in honour of the RedArmy. Why would Israel honour this killing and raping machine of historicalproportions? See above. The same mentality that created the Red Army and decreedits murdering, raping and torturing methods of operation has been in control ofIsrael since it was bombed into existence in 1948. Anyone surprised that it iscommitting genocide against the Palestinians and treats them with hatred andcontempt?TAIL WAGS DOGAgents of the Rothschild Zionist secret society, many from families originallyin Rothschild Germany, have taken control of American banking, business, mediaand politics. I am going to list some of the personnel that Barack Obamaappointed (was told to appoint) after he won the presidential El-ection in late2008 to give you an idea of how the very few dictate to the very many via theRothschild networks. Remember as we go through the names that less than two percent of the population of the United States is Jewish, and a significant numberof those will not be Rothschild Zionists. Obama appointed Rahm Israel Emanuel(Rothschild Zionist) to be his White House Chief of Staff (Fig 243). Emanuel wasObama’s handler who directed and enforced the bloodline agenda from within theWhite House before leaving in 2010 to become Mayor of Chicago – one of the mostpolitically corrupt cities on Earth. This was also where Obama’s politicalcareer was spawned. Emanuel has served in the Israeli army and he is the son ofa former operative with the Irgun terrorist group that helped to bomb Israelinto existence in 1948 and force some 800,000 Palestinians to flee theirhomeland in terror, never to be allowed to return. Many Israelis connected tothe Rothschild networks were sent to the United States after the State of Israelwas established to specifically produce children that would become American-borncitizens to infiltrate the US governmental system in the following generations.Obama’s White House Senior Advisor (another handler) is David Axelrod(Rothschild Zionist), a close associate of Emanuel and the man who ran Obama’s‘change you can believe in’ election campaigns against Hillary Clinton and JohnMcCain. Axelrod now oversees the words on the Teleprompter screens to whichObama is welded often for even the most minor announcement. Axelrod, likeEmanuel, is the product of the Rothschild Zionist ‘political’ Mafia that runsChicago. One of Obama’s chief funders and controllers is the Rothschild Zionistagent, George Soros, the multi-billionaire financial speculator and manipulatorof countries, especially in the former Soviet Union. Obama appointed a stream ofRothschild Zionist ‘advisors’ and ‘czars’ in various subject areas, includingnotorious war criminal and Rothschild Zionist agent, Henry Kissinger. Another‘czar’, Cass Sunstein, the ‘Administrator of the White House Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs’, has called for ‘conspiracy theories’ toeither be banned or taxed. The Rothschilds want to ban any view or research thatexposes the Rothschild agenda, and censor the Internet to stop alternativeinformation from being seen by the public. Sunstein (Rothschild Zionist) saysthe opinion that ‘global warming’ is a manipulated hoax could be an example ofwhat should be banned or taxed (see banned), and so how appropriate that Obamaappointed Carol Browner (Rothschild Zionist) and Todd Stern (Rothschild Zionist)to oversee ‘his’ global-warming/climate-change policies.image [../Images/00311.jpg] Figure 243: Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama: ‘Stick with me son, and I’ll get youthe Nobel Peace Prize for killing people’ Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) The key economic post in the United States is the Chairman of the FederalReserve, the privately-owned and Rothschild-controlled cartel of banks that is –hilariously – known collectively as the ‘central bank of America’. A nationalcentral bank should be answerable to the people, otherwise it’s just anotherprivate bank lending the government ‘money’ which the population has to repay,plus interest. The latter describes the US Federal Reserve, which, as the sayinggoes, is no more federal than the Rothschild-controlled Federal Express. The‘Fed’ was manipulated into being in 1913 by Rothschild Zionists, Jacob Schiffand Paul Warburg at Kuhn, Loeb & Co., funders of the Russian Revolution.Warburg’s son, James Paul Warburg, told the US Senate on July 17th, 1950: ‘Weshall have world government whether or not we like it. The only question iswhether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent.’ Son Warburgwas financial adviser to President Roosevelt during the Great Depression. TheRothschild-controlled Kuhn, Loeb & Co. was a major source of funding for J DRockefeller to expand his Standard Oil Empire, and for the railroad builder,Edward Harriman, and the industrialist, Andrew Carnegie. The Rothschildsultimately controlled all of them, and the banking operation of J.P. Morgan.Jacob Schiff told the New York Chamber of Commerce that ‘unless we have acentral bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going toundergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history’. He waslying, of course. The opposite was true, and so it proved. The Rothschildscreated a financial crisis in America as a Problem–Reaction–Solution toestablish a US central bank that would give them control of the Americaneconomy. Paul Warburg told the Banking and Currency Committee: ‘In the Panic of1907, the first suggestion I made was, let us have a national clearing house[central bank]. The Aldrich Plan [for a central bank] contains many things thatare simply fundamental rules of banking. Your aim must be the same.’ The‘Aldrich Plan’ referred to Senator Nelson Aldrich whose daughter married J DRockefeller Jr. Aldrich was the grandfather of Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller,four-times Mayor of New York and vice president to Gerald Ford. Aldrich and theHidden Hand forced through the legislation that created the Federal ReserveSystem of private (Rothschild) banking interests on December 23rd, 1913 whenmost members of Congress had gone home to their families for Christmas. Thefirst chairman of the Federal Reserve was Charles Sumner Hamlin (RothschildZionist), with Paul Warburg (Rothschild Zionist) also on the board. CongressmanCharles Lindbergh said: > The Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President> [Woodrow Wilson] signs this Bill, the invisible government of the monetary> power will be legalised. The greatest crime of the ages is perpetrated by this> banking and currency bill. He was so right. America has been owned by the Rothschild banking network eversince. President Wilson was owned by the Rothschilds through their agents,Edward Mandell House (Rothschild Zionist) and Bernard Baruch (RothschildZionist). The usual story. See: … And the Truth Shall Set You Free for thedetailed background. The ‘Fed’ prints money for literally cents on the dollarand ‘lends’ it to the government at interest and for profit. What a great scamif you can get away with it; and they have, because the Rothschild networkscontrol the government and the media as well as the Federal Reserve banks.Astonishingly, the ‘Fed’ has never been properly audited since it wasestablished in 1913. We can pick up the ‘Fed’ story with the appointment of PaulAdolph Volcker (Rothschild Zionist) as chairman during the presidencies of JimmyCarter and Ronald Reagan (in truth, George Bush senior). Volcker was a studentat the Rothschild London School of Economics, a former vice president andDirector of Planning with the Rockefeller (Rothschild)-controlled ChaseManhattan Bank, and he left the Federal Reserve in 1987 to become chairman ofthe New York investment banking firm, J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn & Co. James DWolfensohn (Rothschild Zionist) would later became President of the World Bank.Next in line at the Federal Reserve was ‘Mr Big’, Alan Greenspan (RothschildZionist), a practising Satanist according to Phillip Eugene de Rothschild.Greenspan was known as ‘the Wizard’, orchestrating events from behind thecurtain. President Reagan ‘appointed’ him (presidents don’t ‘appoint’ Fedchiefs; they are told who it is going to be) as Chairman of the Federal Reserve,and Greenspan remained in charge of American economic policy throughout theFather Bush and Clinton years and most of Boy Bush’s. He stepped down in 2006 sohe would be in the clear when the crash that he did most to orchestrate wasunleashed on America and the world in September 2008. In his career at the‘Fed’, Greenspan oversaw the systematic dismantling of financial regulationwhich allowed greed and corruption to run riot. The diabolical duo, Tony Blairand his Chancellor and later successor, Gordon Brown, did the same in Britain.Greenspan received enthusiastic support for this policy from Bill Clinton’sTreasury Secretaries, Robert E Rubin (Rothschild Zionist, London School ofEconomics), former co-chairman of the Rothschild-controlled Goldman Sachs, andLarry Summers (Rothschild Zionist), the vicious bully-boy and former ChiefEconomist at the World Bank. Bill Clinton’s Special Assistant to the Presidentfor Economic Policy, and his Senior Economist and Senior Adviser on the Councilof Economic Advisers, was Peter Orszag (Rothschild Zionist, London School ofEconomics). Another Greenspan supporter of mass deregulation was TimothyGeithner (Rothschild Zionist), an assistant to Robert Rubin during the Clintonadministration and later the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.This is the most powerful in the Federal Reserve cartel. Without the collectivedemolition of financial checks and balances by this cabal of Rothschild Zioniststhere would not have been the crash of September 2008.ROTHSCHILD ZIONISTS THAT CRASHED AMERICA AND THE WORLDAn interesting character in this story is Brooksley Born. She was appointedduring the Bill Clinton administration to head a minor government financialagency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Born was honest,conscientious and wanted to protect the finances of the American people. Suchvalues and attitudes were always going bring her big trouble among the den ofcrooks, thieves and Satanists that run the US government and economy. The trioof the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist), TreasurySecretary Robert E Rubin (Rothschild Zionist), and his assistant and latersuccessor, Larry Summers (Rothschild Zionist), set out to destroy Brooksley Bornwhen she began to demand urgent regulation of a criminal enterprise known as OTCderivatives. OTC stands for ‘over the counter’, although UTT, or ‘under thetable’, would have been far more accurate. Derivatives are a scam in whichfraudsters hedge their financial bets by conning someone else into taking therisk. It involves selling the same financial ‘products’ to multiple buyers whoall think they are the only owner. The fraud goes far deeper, but let’s notdwell – it’s not good for my stomach. The OTC derivatives market was completelyunregulated, a free-for-all of transactions that no-one except the peopleinvolved knew anything about. The market was worth $27 trillion by this time andBrooksley Born could see the catastrophic consequences of where this was going.Greenspan told her that he did not believe in rules against fraud in financialmarkets. This was a shocker for someone who believed that she had been appointedto stop financial fraud. She pressed ahead with the process of regulating OTCderivatives despite tremendous pressure not to do so from Greenspan, Rubin andthe usual abuse from the foul-mouthed oaf that is Larry Summers. They alsoemployed the support of Arthur Levitt (Rothschild Zionist), the head of theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This was also supposed to be aregulatory body, but, hey, what’s in a name? This despicable group forced Borninto Congressional hearings and lobbied the useless politicians to block herdesire to regulate. They bent over as usual and did precisely that, of course,even though most of them didn’t know an over-the-counter derivative from anover-the-counter headache pill. Senator Phil Brown of Texas memorably told her:‘I see no evidence whatsoever to suggest that this is a troubled market, or thatfraud is rampant.’ Nice one, Phil; any more bollocks you’d like to share withus? Indeed he had: ‘We should not have one agency innovate this area and indoing so create very substantial financial problems.’ I wonder if he thought thesame in September 2008 when the OTC derivatives market, then worth $600trillion, crashed the global economy. Greenspan told the hearings thatregulation of derivatives would serve no useful purpose. Weeks later thesupposedly top-of-the-range hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, wenttits-up for doing precisely what Brooksley Born wanted to regulate against.Greenspan and Rubin ordered a collection of banks to buy out the fund to keep itafloat. Still nothing was done, because it wasn’t meant to be done. Despitebeing proved right, Congress removed the power to regulate derivatives fromBorn’s agency and she resigned knowing that there was nothing more she could do.The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission today is Gary Gensler(Rothschild Zionist) who spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs. Well, they are notgoing to make the mistake again of letting someone honest and genuine get inamong them are they? The prime architects of the world economic crash of 2008were Alan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist), Robert Rubin (Rothschild Zionist),Larry Summers (Rothschild Zionist) and Timothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist).Greenspan retired from the Federal Reserve two years before the crash that hepurposely engineered. He was given America’s highest civilian honour, theCongressional Gold Medal, and was succeeded by Ben Bernanke (Rothschild Zionist,London School of Economics). Robert Rubin went off to Citibank, which laterreceived $100 billion in taxpayer bailouts to stay afloat. But where did Summersand Geithner end up? Well, well.POACHERS TURN … POACHERSBarack Obama replaced Bush as the US President a few months after the crash, andwho did ‘he’ appoint to ‘his’ economic team to ‘sort out the mess’? The verypeople who purposely created it. This was all done from a White House controlledby Rahm Emanuel (Rothschild Zionist) and David Axelrod (Rothschild Zionist).Obama made Timothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist) his Treasury Secretary –Obama’s mother worked for Geithner’s father, Peter F Geithner (RothschildZionist), the director of the Asia program at the Ford Foundation in New York(Fig 244 [../Text/index_split_111.html#filepos899852]). Larry Summers(Rothschild Zionist) was appointed Director of the White House National EconomicCouncil (Fig 245 [../Text/index_split_112.html#filepos900266]), and Paul AdolphVolcker (Rothschild Zionist), business partner of the Rothschilds, was madeChairman of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Other economic positions wentto Peter Orszag (Rothschild Zionist), Director of the Office of Management andBudget; Jared Bernstein (Rothschild Zionist), Chief Economist and EconomicPolicy Adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden; Mary Schapiro (RothschildZionist), Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Gary Gensler(Rothschild Zionist), Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC);Sheila Bair (Rothschild Zionist), Chairman, Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (FDIC); and Karen Mills (Rothschild Zionist), Administrator, SmallBusiness Administration (SBA). I need say no more than to point out again thatJewish people make up only two per cent of the American population and asignificant number of those will not be Rothschild Zionists. But don’t worry;there’s no conspiracy. The gang that trashed the town was now back in town totrash it even more, and you’ll never guess … they decided that the only way tosave an economy brought to its knees by their collective actions and the bankingsystem they represent was to, well, no, surely not … hand trillions oftaxpayer-borrowed dollars to the Rothschild-controlled banks and insurancecompanies like Citigroup (advised to disaster by Rothschild Zionist Robert ERubin), J.P. Morgan, AIG and a long list of others."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00312.jpg] Figure 244: Timothy Geithner helped to cause the crash of 2008 and has sinceoverseen, with others, the looting of America for his bloodline banking cohorts "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00313.jpg] Figure 245: Lovely Larry Summers Overseeing this and all other American government spending was Obama’s BudgetDirector, the already-mentioned Peter Orszag (Rothschild Zionist, London Schoolof Economics), who worked closely with Rahm Emanuel (Rothschild Zionist) toimpose the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that has devastatedAmerican industry in line with Rothschild policy. NAFTA is a stalking horse forthe North American Union just as the ‘Common Market’ was for the European Union.Orszag was the founder and president of the economic consultancy firm whichadvised the Central Bank of Iceland in the period before the Icelandic bankingcrash, and he advised the Russian Ministry of Finance when the country’sresource assets were being given to Rothschild Zionist oligarchs like ChelseaFootball Club owner, Roman Abramovich, who became instant billionaires. Orszagresigned as Budget Director in July 2010 with ‘job done’, but, no matter. Obamaannounced that Jacob Lew (Rothschild Zionist), Under-Secretary of State toHillary Clinton, would take over and resume the same post that he held underBill Clinton. By the time the economic brown stuff hit the spinning wheel inSeptember 2008, Ben Bernanke (Rothschild Zionist) was running the FederalReserve (as a figurehead, with Greenspan still in the background). Bernankeprinted even more money (at interest to the taxpayer) to hand to his RothschildZionist mates and controllers in Wall Street. Meanwhile, Treasury SecretaryTimothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist), who has been centrally involved inhanding trillions of dollars of public money to his banking associates with nostrings attached, asked the opinion of a private international RothschildZionist ‘law firm’ called Squire, Sanders & Dempsey to see if American statescould, as some requested, legally use bailout money or TARP – the Troubled AssetRelief Program – to support the legal bills of people trying to protect theirhomes from foreclosure by the bailed out banking system. The privately-ownedRothschild Zionist Squire, Sanders & Dempsey said ‘no’, they couldn’t, and soTimothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist) said the money could not be used toprotect the public, who had bailed out the banks, from being foreclosed by thosesame banks. Americans need to understand this – the world needs to understandthis. America, via the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, is owned by the RothschildZionist secret society. They own and control the banks that crashed the American(and world) economy and put Americans and vast numbers of others across theplanet out of work and on the street; and they own the Federal Reserve cartelthat bailed out the banks with stupendous amounts of credit ‘money’ which theAmerican people will be paying back for generations, if indeed they ever do.While all this has been going on, Rothschild Zionists were running the majorworld financial institutions. The president of the World Bank is Robert BZoellick (Rothschild Zionist), a big-time Boy Bush administration insider whowas a fervent advocate of invading Iraq long before even 9/11. Zoellick tookover at the World Bank from the disgraced Paul Wolfowitz (Rothschild Zionist),another orchestrator of the Iraqi invasion, as Deputy Defense Secretary. Thechief of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was Dominique Strauss-Kahn(Rothschild Zionist), the French politician who was expected to challengePresident Nicolas Sarkozy (Rothschild Zionist) at the next French election untilthat idea hit the buffers in a New York hotel room. This would have madeNapoleon look-alike Sarkozy very happy. The president of the European CentralBank (ECB) is Jean-Claude Trichet (Rothschild Zionist), another Frenchman whotook over in 2003 following his acquittal in a trial over ‘financialirregularities’ at one of France’s biggest banks, Crédit Lyonnais. Anyone think,given these facts, that the Rothschild Zionists might just control globalfinance and could possibly, oh just a little bit, have orchestrated the crash of2008 and what has followed?? Jean-Claude Trichet (Rothschild Zionist) at theEuropean Central Bank and Dominique Strauss-Kahn (Rothschild Zionist) at the IMFwere central to the ‘bailout’ of Ireland (the bailout of Irish banks and theEl-ite investors, like the Rothschilds, by the people of Ireland). Bailed-outbanks that caused the crash and were then deluged with the people’s borrowedmoney were also invariably controlled, directly or ultimately, by RothschildZionists. These include Goldman Sachs, headed by Lloyd Blankfein (RothschildZionist), and established by Rothschild Zionists, Marcus Goldman and SamuelSachs, who came from families that relocated to America from Germany, where thename ‘Rothschild’ (Saturn) originated.IN-YOUR-FACE CORRUPTIONGoldman Sachs was responsible in the extreme for the crash of September 2008,but by that time its former Chairman and CEO, Henry ‘Hank’ Paulson Jr., had beeninstalled as US Treasury Secretary by President Bush to begin the bank bailoutpolicy that Obama and Bernanke would complete. The decisions made by Paulsonwere of enormous benefit to Goldman Sachs in the closing weeks of the Bushadministration. Goldman Sachs was also instrumental in the collapse of the Greekeconomy that started the ‘euro panic’ which later engulfed Ireland, Portugal andothers. The result was that unemployment in Greece soared by 40 per cent, andsome 42 per cent of young people are without a job at the time of writing. Thesewere yet more devastated lives, but the Rothschild Zionists don’t give a damn.Human suffering is exactly what they are trying to achieve, after all. They havethe whole system stitched up. The Rothschild Zionist secret-society networkshave their agents in governments, the banking system – including theinternational institutions like the World Bank – and control the reporting oftheir activities through ownership and control of the mainstream media. In 2011,BBC ‘reporter’, Tom de Castella, produced an article on the BBC websiteentitled: ‘Bilderberg mystery: Why do people believe in cabals?’ The ‘mystery’,to the idiot BBC, was not why a crowd of powerful people from across the worldin government, banking, big business, media and military, etc. would meettogether in secret, but why people believe there could be anything sinister init. They quoted David Aaronovitch (Rothschild Zionist), a ‘columnist’ on TheTimes newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch (Rothschild Zionist). Aaronovitch saidof the Bilderberg Group: ‘It’s really an occasional supper club for the rich andpowerful.’ He should join the BBC immediately. The Children’s Department wouldsuit. Or comedy. The BBC is an arm of the government, and with a few honourableexceptions the corporation employs people who will not be journalists, except inname, as long they continue to breathe. This lack of real journalism and thecontrol of banking, business and government means that if it is happeningeconomically and politically, it is because the Rothschilds want it that way.This is true of banking, stock markets, commodity markets, currency valuation,the price of gold – the lot. The world of finance is dictated by ‘investorconfidence’, and that is dictated by those who have the power to control themedia, government and central bank financial statements, and who have thefinancial resources to move trillions around the financial markets every day –the Rothschilds and their lackeys, in other words. Rothschild Zionism is anEl-ite secret society at its rotten core. The people I am naming here, and somany more I could name, are not agents of Jewish people as a whole, but agentsof the secret society which has mercilessly manipulated the Jewish populationfor centuries to advance its tyrannical goals.HELP YOU DESTROY THE PALESTINIANS? YESSIR, MR ROTHSCHILDIt is impossible to become President of the United States without support fromthe American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). This sounds like somethingto do with government, which it is, in truth, although not officially. In manyways it is the government. AIPAC is a Rothschild Zionist lobby group, one of thebiggest in America, backed by limitless money. Hold that thought for a moment.One of the biggest lobby groups in Washington D.C., perhaps the biggest, isrepresenting the interests of a foreign power. It is almost impossible to securehigh political office of any kind if AIPAC doesn’t approve, and a real struggleto even become a member of Congress or the Senate if AIPAC opposes you. FormerBBC and Independent Television News correspondent, Alan Hart, wrote in Zionism:The Real Enemy of the Jews (World Focus Publishing; 2005): ‘Jewish people makeup less than two per cent of the American population, but account for 50 percent of the political campaign contributions.’ Rothschild Zionist-owned TheWashington Post said that ‘between 50 and 70 per cent’ of presidential campaigncontributions came from Rothschild Zionist sources. This figure isoverwhelmingly made up of mega-rich Rothschild Zionists, and it is not in theleast representative of half to 70 per cent of the Jewish population (Fig 246[../Text/index_split_113.html#filepos911353]). More than half of the 40 biggestcorporate donors to the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and John McCainin 2008 were from corporations owned by Rothschild Zionists. They fund the manthey really want and also his opponent so that they can control the outcome.American presidential and vice presidential candidates may differ here andthere, though less and less, but they all agree on one thing every time: Israelgets what Israel wants. Why would this not be the case when the Rothschilds ownthe United States government as they own Israel? Investigative journalist, WayneMadsen, described the situation very well:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00314.jpg] Figure 246: They have one thing in common. What can it be?

The Israeli blockade ofGaza had led to an unemployment rate of 45 per cent by 2011, one of the higheston the planet. The buying power of wages for those who did have work hadplummeted by more than 34 per cent in five years. Two-thirds of the Gazapopulation are refugees. Gaza has no airport or seaport to receive supplies.Everything has to go through Israel. The Israeli occupation of the PalestinianWest Bank includes more than 600 checkpoints and roadblocks. Palestinianambulances with critically injured people or women about to give birth areroutinely prevented from going through. The average journey time for aPalestinian ambulance in 2001 was ten minutes. In 2011, it was almost two hours.Israel’s racism is beyond belief. Associated Foreign Press reported that Israelis to build a ‘tolerance museum’ on a Muslim burial site despite protests fromthose who have family buried there. An Israeli court simply decreed that it wasno longer a burial site. What did the bodies do then, demanifest? The IsraelState machine is without heart or empathy; it is vicious, cruel and gloats inthe suffering of its victims. The Knesset passed a law banning anyone fromcalling for a boycott of Israeli goods in protest at the fascism of itsgovernment and this allows companies to sue boycott campaigners without havingto prove any damage or loss. The law includes calls for boycotts of goodsproduced at illegal Jewish settlements stolen by force from Palestinians.Boycott campaigners are banned from bidding for government tenders and the lawsays: ‘It is prohibited to initiate a boycott of the State of Israel, toencourage participation in a boycott, or to provide assistance or informationwith the purpose of promoting a boycott.’ Fascism, fascism, fascism. Even asenior Israeli army commander spoke publicly in 2011 about unchecked ‘Jewishterror’ against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank by extremist, andillegal, Jewish settlers. Major General Avi Mizrahi said that the settlement ofYitzhar, one of the most ‘radical’ (insane) Jewish strongholds, should beclosed. He said that it was a source of terror against Palestinians. IsraeliForeign Minister, the ultra-extremist, Avigdor Lieberman, lives illegally in aWest Bank settlement. ‘What’s happening in the field is terrorism,’ GeneralMizrahi said. Jewish settlers burn mosques and Palestinian olive groves,vandalise property and murder people. This is daily life for Palestinians evenwithout the constant cruelty and terror inflicted by the Israeli army. While Iwas writing this chapter, Israeli troops uprooted 300 olive trees owned byPalestinians and declared the land a military area. Just like that. This is whatis happening day after day. Also as I write, a Committee of the IsraeliParliament has passed the first draft of a law which will force Palestinians topay the demolition costs when Israeli troops knock down their homes. Israel hasdemolished more than 25,000 Palestinian homes since the occupation began in 1967– 90 per cent of them for ‘administrative’ reasons. They either lacked a permit(the remit of the Israelis) or the military decided that they wanted the land.The families that live in the properties simply become homeless. No buildingpermits have been issued to Palestinians in the same period since the start ofthe occupation. The homes are demolished by armoured bulldozers sold to theIsraeli military by the Caterpillar corporation in the United States. TheIsraeli government has also approved the formation of a committee to ‘Judaise’the names of Palestinian towns and historical sites and eliminate Palestinianidentity. It is cumulative genocide on the TV news."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00315.jpg] Figure 247: Oh, such big brave men – a daily scene in occupied Palestine The cold and callous Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced in2011 that he intends to make conditions tougher for Palestinian prisoners. Hewas talking about the 11,000 or so Palestinian men, women and children held inIsraeli jails – many without charge – leaving families without a breadwinner.They are subjected to solitary confinements, sudden night raids and torture, andthey are denied baths, clean clothes and visits from their families. No soul. Noempathy. But even this is not enough for the merciless Netanyahu. ‘I havedecided to change Israel’s treatment of terrorists sitting in prison,’ Netanyahusaid in June 2011. ‘We will give them all that they deserve according tointernational law but nothing beyond that.’ No they won’t. Israel’s treatment ofprisoners already drives a coach and horses through ‘international law’. Israelis in contravention of the most basic human decency in its treatment and tortureof Palestinian prisoners – including children. Some 700,000 Palestinians havebeen jailed by Israel since it began the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank in1967. This is 20 per cent of the Palestinian population and 40 per cent of themale population. The Israeli military courts system controls trials, sentencingand imprisonment of Palestinian detainees and provides both the prosecutor andthe judge. Israelis in the same areas are only subject to civilian law. SaharFrancis, director of Addameer, the Prisoners’ Support and Human RightsAssociation, said that prisoners, including children, were subject to sleepdeprivation, threats of sexual abuse and physical violence, prolonged periodsspent in complete isolation, and the arrests of family members to forceconfessions. She went on: > Especially in the case of juveniles, it’s threatening them before even coming> to the interrogation so it will make it easier to collect their confessions.> They will be really terrified. They humiliate them. They start to beat them> and kick them and abuse them all the way to the detention center.

In some other cases, they close> [their] eyes and tie [them] to the chair. They push back [their] head and then> they bring a cup of water and they start to drop water on [their] face, giving> a feeling like [they] can’t breathe. [Torture is] very common. It’s very> common. When you see what they do in public, imagine what goes on out of sight; butIsrael does whatever it likes, unchallenged. Netanyahu also announced that30,000 Palestinians from the Bedouin community were going to be evicted fromtheir land and forced to relocate to sites designated by the Israeli government.Just like that. No debate; no right to be heard. Israel condemns the Nazis inGermany and then establishes a fascist state itself. Is this merely irony, orcould it just be that the force behind the Nazis is the force behind Israel? Ithink it could, you know, and it begins with ‘R’. This is the same Israeliregime that political prostitute, ‘shapeshifter’ Tony Blair, told a RothschildZionist audience was ‘a model for this region’. (More Blair, more, I’m about toorgasm.) ‘Israel is the land of God’s people, except for the Palestinians, and Iam proud to lick anything you want so I can bask in your glory and have yourcheques in the post.’ (Ohhhhh, thank you, Blair; that took me over the edge. Nowgo and make the tea.) No wonder Blair was made ‘Special Envoy’ to the MiddleEast representing the United Nations, United States, European Union and Russia.It is another stitch-up for the Palestinians to appoint a mendacious RothschildZionist sycophant to make sure Israel’s case is the only one promoted. TheUnited Nations, United States, European Union and Russia all know that, ofcourse, but then they are all Rothschild-controlled. Chris Gunness, a spokesmanfor the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, said: ‘It is hard tounderstand the logic of a man-made policy which deliberately impoverishes somany and condemns hundreds of thousands of potentially productive people to alife of destitution.’ Oh, the logic is simple, Chris. The idea is to destroythem, mate. What does Obama or any other president or prime minister have to sayabout this? Nothing. Obama made a speech at the American Israel Public AffairsCommittee (AIPAC) on American (Rothschild) Middle East policy while I waswriting this book. The first speech that he made on this subject after becomingpresident was written, according to The Wall Street Journal, by James Steinberg(Rothschild Zionist), Daniel Kurtzer (Rothschild Zionist) and Dennis Ross(Rothschild Zionist). Do you think that there is a possibility that the speechmight have been in any way biased? This is no surprise when the Rothschildnetwork owns Obama, lock, stock and Teleprompter, and also owns Israel – indeedcreated it (Fig 248 [../Text/index_split_115.html#filepos923935]). AIPAC iscurrently headed by Lee ‘Rosy’ Rosenberg, a close friend and funder of Obamafrom Chicago, and probably on good terms with Wolf Blitzer (Rothschild Zionist),the leading CNN presenter who was once a spokesman for AIPAC and correspondentfor the Jerusalem Post (Fig 249 [../Text/index_split_116.html#filepos924424]).Obama is hardly going to upset a close friend and funder like ‘Rosy’, and theorganisation that he has to keep sweet (if he is going to win a second term), bysaying anything about Israel that hasn’t been pre-agreed. He said in ‘his’speech to AIPAC: > I was joined at the White House by Prime Minister Netanyahu, and we reaffirmed> that fundamental truth that has guided our presidents and prime ministers for> more than 60 years – that, even while we may at times disagree, as friends> sometimes will [yeah, sure], the bonds between the United States and Israel> are unbreakable, and the commitment of the United States to the security of> Israel is ironclad. "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00316.jpg] Figure 248: Rothschild Zionist-enslaved America Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00317.jpg] Figure 249: AIPAC and its lapdog alleged ‘president’ – and the consequences forthe people of occupied Palestine Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) This outrage has gone on for well over 60 years because the Rothschilds havecontrolled Israel and the United States government all that time. Does that mean‘ironclad’ no matter what the scale of atrocities Israel commits, oh Great One?Yep, that kind of ‘ironclad’. Obama said the following about two countries thathave waged continual and horrific wars of violence and attrition, overt andcovert, against the target populations: > America’s commitment to Israel’s security also flows from a deeper place – and> that’s the values we share. As two people who struggled to win our freedom> against overwhelming odds, we understand that preserving the security for> which our forefathers fought must be the work of every generation. As two> vibrant democracies, we recognise that the liberties and freedom we cherish> must be constantly nurtured. And as the nation that recognised the State of> Israel moments after its independence, we have a profound commitment to its> survival as a strong, secure homeland of the Jewish people. If Obama wasn’t a narcissistic sociopath, he would surely have choked. But hewas away with the fairies now… > We also know how difficult that search for security can be, especially for a> small nation like Israel in a tough neighbourhood. I’ve seen it first-hand.> When I touched my hand against the Western Wall and placed my prayer between> its ancient stones, I thought of all the centuries that the children of Israel> had longed to return to their ancient homeland. Heck, now I’m choking. Must be because I’m throwing up. This ‘small nation likeIsrael’ has one of the best equipped militaries in the world – virtually all ofit supplied by American governments and paid for by American taxpayers. As Obamahimself said: > Because we understand the challenges Israel faces, I and my administration> have made the security of Israel a priority. It’s why we’ve increased> cooperation between our militaries to unprecedented levels. It’s why we’re> making our most advanced technologies available to our Israeli allies. And> it’s why, despite tough fiscal times, we’ve increased foreign military> financing to record levels. > That includes additional support – beyond regular military aid – for the Iron> Dome anti-rocket system. This is a powerful example of American–Israeli> cooperation, which has already intercepted rockets from Gaza and helped saved> innocent Israeli lives. So make no mistake, we will maintain Israel’s> qualitative military edge. Israel’s ‘qualitative military edge’ is actually Israel’s qualitative militarydomination courtesy of an American public that has never been asked, and largenumbers of whom are in desperate financial straits. Homes for Americans? No –bombs for Israel. The truth is that the American government is not here to dowhat is best for its people. The role of government – all government – is toserve the demands and interests of the Rothschild networks that own and controlIsrael. This understanding makes it easy to see why the priority of Americanadministrations is not homes for Americans, but bombs for Israel – tointimidate, to torture and to kill defenceless Palestinians.SYSTEMATIC GENOCIDEHave a look at the map in Figure 250[../Text/index_split_117.html#filepos935530]. The darker area on the left isPalestinian land before the campaign of terror that bombed Israel into being in1948; on the right is Palestinian land in the year 2000. There is far less todayeven than this, as Jewish ‘settlers’, aided and abetted by their government,steal more and more land by bulldozing the homes of Palestinians and forcingthem to leave. What you are looking at is genocide: ‘The systematic andwidespread extermination or attempted extermination of an entire national,racial, religious or ethnic group.’ Obama never says anything about this, forwoe betide him if he does – and he knows it (Fig 251[../Text/index_split_118.html#filepos935911]). The garbage Obama spoke in 2011about Israelis and Palestinians returning to their 1967 borders was him tellingMuslims what he thinks they want to hear as part of a much bigger globaloperation. He knows too well that Israel will never agree to returning to theborders of 1967 or anything else. The illusory ‘rift’ between him and themerciless Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is circulated in the medianow and then to sell the lie to the Muslim world that Obama is standing up forthem. I have been saying for at least 30 years that Israel is not interested ina ‘peaceful settlement’. The Rothschild Zionists want everything, and that meansthe systematic destruction of the Palestinian people (Fig 252[../Text/index_split_119.html#filepos936416]). They have to buy time to allowthat to happen, and this is what the ‘peace talks’, ‘road maps’ and ‘talks abouttalks’ have been all about decade after decade and still are – buying time. Nomatter what the Palestinians offer – and they have precious little left to offer– there will always be a reason why Israel can’t accept. There is always a newdemand and that’s the way it has been from the start. The only concession theIsraeli government fascists are interested in is for the Palestinians to startwalking and get out of the place. Most people won’t realise, but a Rothschildhas been right at the centre of all this in many guises – Major General DannyRothschild. He joined the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in 1964 and four yearslater transferred to senior positions (of course) in the Intelligence corps(Mossad, in others words – they run everything). Rothschild later becameassistant to Moshe Levi, the IDF Chief of Staff, and was promoted to the rank ofBrigadier General and commander of the IDF Units in Southern Lebanon. He went onto become deputy director of the Military Intelligence Directorate and directorof Research Department. In the latter role, he was responsible for ‘nationalstrategic’ research and analysis, both politically and militarily, before andduring the first Gulf War in 1991. He became a Major General after that war andwas appointed Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, whichmeans controlling the occupied Palestinian lands in Gaza and the West Bank.Rothschild’s actions and public statements reveal him to be a prime force behindthe inhuman treatment of the Palestinians, including the killing of children,and the stealing of their lands. He is still very active after his officialmilitary ‘retirement’ in ‘think tanks’, the Central Bank of Israel and otherorganisations connected to Israel’s political, financial, military andIntelligence activities. Danny Rothschild has certainly played a highlysignificant role in the ‘buying time’ policy that I am talking about, and hisinfluence in Israeli policy is fundamental as a representative in Israel of hisdastardly family. One of the main ways that the Israelis stall on any agreementis by saying they can’t negotiate with the (El-ected) Palestinian governmentbecause it is a terrorist organisation known as ‘Hamas’. Well, how funny. Israelcreated Hamas as a bogeyman that could give them the excuse not to negotiate andso have more time to finish the job. The other bogeyman re-emerging in theMiddle East to frighten people is called the ‘Muslim Brotherhood’ which wasinvolved in the ‘people’s revolution’ (sure) in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhoodhas an interesting background, too. Britain and America established the MuslimBrotherhood after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1924 and they are stillcontrolled by the same crowd to this day, although the Brotherhood has alsoserved the interests of the Nazis, Israelis, Russians, French and Germans overthe years. Israel is now among the major sponsors of the Muslim Brotherhoodwhich was involved in the founding of Hamas. Robert Dreyfuss is the author ofDevil’s Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam(Metropolitan Books, 2005). He wrote:’ … beginning in 1967 through the late1980s, Israel helped the Muslim Brotherhood establish itself in the occupiedterritories. It assisted Ahmed Yassin, the leader of the Brotherhood, increating Hamas, betting that its Islamist character would weaken the PLO’. ThePLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) was then the most prominent officialrepresentative of Palestinian interests. Dreyfuss also pointed out that ‘duringthe 1980s, the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza and the West Bank did not supportresistance to the Israeli occupation. Most of its energy went to fighting thePLO, especially its more left-wing factions, on university campuses’. CharlesFreeman, the one-time American ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said: ‘Israel startedHamas. It was a project of Shin Bet [Israel’s domestic Intelligence agency],which had a feeling that they could use it to hem in the PLO.’ David Shipler, areporter with The New York Times, quotes the Israeli military governor of Gazaas saying that Israel financed Islamic fundamentalists to oppose the PLO.Shipler said:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00318.jpg] Figure 250: How Palestine has been stolen amid a genocidal campaign of death anddestruction against the Palestinian people "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00319.jpg] Figure 251: Obama – Israel’s man in the White House Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00320.jpg] Figure 252: Genocide playing out on the television news (and so much more sothan the mainstream media will report) Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) > Politically speaking, Islamic fundamentalists were sometimes regarded as> useful to Israel, because they had conflicts with the secular supporters of> the PLO. Violence between the two groups erupted occasionally on West Bank> university campuses. Israeli military governor of the Gaza Strip, Brigadier> General Yitzhak Segev, once told me how he had financed the Islamic movement> as a counterweight to the PLO and the Communists. ‘The Israeli Government gave> me a budget and the military government gives to the mosques,’ he said. The PLO, headed by Yasser Arafat, said that Hamas was operating with the directsupport of ‘reactionary Arab regimes’ together with the Israeli occupiers.Arafat told an Italian newspaper: ‘Hamas is a creation of Israel, which at thetime of Prime Minister Shamir, gave them money and more than 700 institutions,among them schools, universities and mosques.’ Arafat said that Israeli PrimeMinister, Yitzhak Rabin, had told him in the presence of Egypt’s PresidentMubarak that Israel had supported Hamas. It goes like this. Every time there isany chance of a ‘peace agreement’ which would commit Israel to an outcome thatit doesn’t want, Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood carry out a terrorist attack(or Mossad does) and this is used as the excuse to end ‘negotiations’. Israelorders its agents in Hamas to start firing the military equivalent ofpeashooters at Israel to justify the state-of-the-art bombing and mass murder ofPalestinians in ‘retaliation’. Hamas representatives who won’t play ball withIsrael are the ones that are targeted. Mossad agents entered Dubai on forgedBritish passports in 2010, and in full view of hotel security cameras they wentto the room of an off-message Hamas senior commander, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, andmurdered him before calmly walking away past the same cameras. Their images wereposted on the Internet and the authorities know who committed the murder, but,as ever, nothing was done about it (Fig 253[../Text/index_split_120.html#filepos942659]). Israel is a law unto itself, andit was the same story with the illegal use of British identities and passports;but then the UK Foreign Secretary at the time was David Miliband (RothschildZionist), brother of the current British Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband(Rothschild Zionist, London School of Economics). Mossad operates in every majorcountry and most of the not-so major. Former French Foreign Minister RolandDumas has said that Israelis ‘are doing whatever they want in France, and arecontrolling the French Intelligence …’ The bomb in Oslo, Norway and the massshooting on the island of Utøya on July 22nd 2011 had Rothschild ‘false flag’experts, Mossad, written all over them. The young people who were killed in suchnumbers were attending a gathering of the Norwegian Labour Party’s youthmovement which was vociferously campaigning for a boycott of Israeli goods.Labour Party ministers had strongly spoken out about Israel’s treatment of thePalestinians and the government had indicated that it would recognise aPalestinian state – much to the fury (they do fury) of Israel. Supportingjustice for the Palestinians can be a death sentence. In 2010, Israelicommandoes murdered nine Turkish activists on the ship Mavi Marmara for thecrime of trying to get urgently needed supplies to a Gaza Strip blockaded byIsrael. The ship was illegally seized in international waters. A United Nationshuman rights inquiry found that Israel was guilty of wilful killing andunnecessary brutality and torture. The report said that there was ‘clearevidence to support prosecutions of the following crimes within the terms ofarticle 147 of the fourth Geneva Convention: wilful killing; torture or inhumantreatment; wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body orhealth’. But what happened? Nothing. The report encapsulated Israel’s methods ofoperation when it said that ‘the conduct of the Israeli military and otherpersonnel toward the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate to theoccasion, but demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredibleviolence. It betrayed an unacceptable level of brutality’. This is the sick anddepraved regime that American leaders call ‘the Middle East’s only democracy’,and prostitute Blair calls ‘a model for the region’. Put into YouTube the words:‘An American Jew Subjected to Torture in Jerusalem’, and you’ll see howdemocratic they are. Another supply flotilla was planned to head for Gaza in2011, and 25 per cent of those on board were amazing and truly wonderfulanti-Zionist Jewish people saying ‘not in our name’. A ship jointly-owned bySwedish, Greek and Norwegian activists hoping to join the flotilla had itspropeller cut while in Athens harbour in a deliberate act of sabotage. Mossad isnothing if not beyond the imagination pathetic. Little boys in short trouserswho think they are ‘real men’ (little dicks scramble their self-esteem), and‘real women’ who act like ‘real men’. Talking of which, Rothschild Zionistshill, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, warned the flotilla not to headfor Gaza on the orders of her bosses at Chateau Rothschild and in Tel Aviv.

The Greek government of American-born Prime Minister, GeorgePapandreou (Rothschild Zionist, Bilderberg Group, London School of Economics),took time out from destroying the Greek economy, impoverishing his people andselling the country to the Rothschild banks and corporations, to stop the 2011Gaza flotilla leaving Greek waters. He had just had a visit from Netanyahu andreceived his orders. The theme of ‘Israel’s right to defend itself’ has alreadybeen used to justify mass murder of Palestinians and it is planned to be wheeledout again and again to excuse Israel’s first strikes – on the grounds ofattacking before you are attacked when the target you are attacking had nointention of attacking you in the first place. What you might call getting yourretaliation in first. We even have Americans, campaigning against Israeliapartheid and American-funded abuse of people in Colombia, being arrested andput before a grand jury for giving support to ‘foreign terrorist organisations’.This follows a dramatic expansion of the US government’s definition of whatconstitutes material support for a foreign terrorist organisation. Peacefullycampaigning for justice and travelling to meet the victims of injustice inPalestine and Colombia is ‘material support for terrorism’, but bombing theinnocent in Libya is doing God’s work. We have the same Rothschild Zionistinfluence in Britain, and in many other countries around the world. Canada, forexample, is controlled root and branch by Rothschild Zionists. The Britishversion of AIPAC is the Friends of Israel network in every major politicalparty, and one investigation discovered that 80 per cent of Members ofParliament in the now ruling Conservative Party are members of the Friends ofIsrael. This has the stated goal of supporting anything that is good for Israel(the Rothschilds who own Israel). British Prime Minister, David Cameron, is aRothschild Zionist and so is the leader of the Labour ‘opposition’, Ed Miliband,who got the job after a campaign in which his brother, David Miliband(Rothschild Zionist), was the only other serious candidate. The UK’s Jewishpopulation (and many are not Rothschild Zionists) is just 280,000 in a nationalpopulation of 62 million. A major financial backer of Cameron and hisConservative Party now in government has been Rothschild Zionist arms tradebillionaire, Poju Zabludowicz, who also donates to the Conservative Friends ofIsrael. The most influential manipulating force in the governments of Tony Blairand Gordon Brown was Peter Mandelson (Rothschild Zionist). He flaunts his closeconnections to the Rothschilds by taking holidays at their mansion on the Greekisland of Corfu. The Rothschilds controlled Blair as they controlled BillClinton and Boy Bush (Fig 254). This was the connection that led to Blair takingBritain into wars in support of both presidents as they were being urged on byIsrael (the Rothschilds). The Rothschilds orchestrated the invasions ofAfghanistan and Iraq, the War on Terror and the justification – 9/11.image [../Images/00322.jpg] Figure 254: ‘Shapeshifter’ Tony Blair – arse-licker for sale 9/11: ROTHSCHILD ZIONISTS WHEREVER YOU LOOKThe lease of the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center was purchased just weeksbefore September 11th, 2001 by businessmen, Larry Silverstein (RothschildZionist) and Frank Lowy (Rothschild Zionist). Both have very close links toIsraeli leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Prime Minister.Netanyahu said that what happened on 9/11 was ‘good for Israel’. The deal to buythe lease was done with Lewis Eisenberg (Rothschild Zionist), head of the NewYork Port Authority, vice president of the American Israel Public AffairsCommittee (AIPAC) and a former partner at the Rothschild-controlled GoldmanSachs. Eisenberg is also close to the Israeli leadership. The man who lobbiedheavily for the New York Port Authority to sell the lease into private hands wasRonald S Lauder (Rothschild Zionist), from the Estée Lauder cosmetics family. Heis involved in a long list of Rothschild Zionist organisations, including theJewish National Fund, World Jewish Congress, American Jewish Joint DistributionCommittee and the Rothschild Anti-Defamation League. Buying the World TradeCenter lease was a terrible business deal for Silverstein and Lowy. The TwinTowers were known as the ‘white elephants’ because of the state they were in andthe fantastic amount of asbestos that needed to be dealt with. Silverstein saidafter being asked why he had bought the lease: ‘I felt a compelling urge to ownthem.’ I’ll bet he did. When the deal was struck, Silverstein and company vastlyincreased the insurance in the event of a ‘terrorist attack’ and they wereawarded $4.55 billion after the Twin Towers came down. The lease had cost $3.2billion and Silverstein reportedly only invested $14 million of his own money.The judge who oversaw the litigation between Silverstein and the insurancecompanies was Michael B Mukasey (Rothschild Zionist), who later became USAttorney General. Silverstein and Lowy had originally been outbid by $50 millionfor the World Trade Center lease by a company called Vornado, whose chiefshareholder was the Jewish businessman, Bernard Mendik. He was Silverstein’sformer brother-inlaw and they had seriously fallen out after his divorce fromSilverstein’s sister. Then Vornado, despite having the best bid, suddenly had achange of heart and pulled out leaving the field free for Silverstein and Lowy.No wonder they call him ‘Lucky Larry’. Bernard Mendik died after becoming‘suddenly ill’ weeks after Silverstein and Lowy presented their final bid forthe World Trade Center. So many ‘suddenlys’. Silverstein had breakfast everymorning with his children in the Windows on the World restaurant, more than 100floors up in the North Tower, but none of them showed on 9/11. Silverstein saidhe had a last minute ‘dermatologist appointment’ when in truth, as one of hisbodyguards has said privately, Silverstein had a phone call in his car tellinghim to stay away from the World Trade Center. Silverstein said in a televisioninterview (which he now deeply regrets) that when another of his buildings inthe World Trade Center complex was on fire, the decision was made to ‘pull it’ –the classic term for a controlled demolition (Fig 255[../Text/index_split_121.html#filepos952437]). This was Building Seven, or theSalomon Brothers Building, which had not been hit by an aircraft. Soonafterwards, Building Seven collapsed in on itself in what was an obviouscontrolled demolition. Put: ‘Building Seven Collapse’ into YouTube and you’llsee what happened. The problem with Silverstein’s ‘pull it’ story is that it cantake many weeks, even months, to place charges in a building as big as the47-storey Building Seven to make it collapse as it did. How could the decisionbe made to ‘pull it’ and then down it comes? This is simply not anywhere evenclose to possible; but then it didn’t need to be. The charges were planted longbefore the official decision was made to ‘pull it’ and the whole 9/11 scenariounfolded from a pre-planned script. A BBC reporter announced on live televisionthat Building Seven had collapsed half an hour before it actually did, becausethe authorities released the ‘news’ too early. The building was still standingin the background behind her as she reported its demise."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00323.jpg] Figure 255: Lucky Larry ‘Pull it’ and ‘I’ve suddenly developed a skin problem onmy way to breakfast’ Silverstein Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) THEY TOLD US THE PLANThe Bush administration was famously controlled by the so-called ‘neocons’, orneoconservatives. These were led by a cabal of Rothschild Zionists such asRichard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Dov Zakheim, Robert Kagan, Douglas Feith, WilliamKristol (editor of the Rothschild Zionist The Weekly Standard) and Lewis‘Scooter’ Libby, the disbarred American attorney and convicted felon who wasformer ‘advisor’ to Vice President Dick Cheney. This gang also includedRothschild Zionist, Robert Zoellick, now head of the World Bank, who replacedhis neocon and Rothschild Zionist colleague, Paul Wolfowitz. The neoconleadership wrote to President Bill Clinton urging him to attack Iraq long before9/11, and they went into overdrive to advocate the invasions of Iraq andAfghanistan after the World Trade Center attacks under Bush. These sameRothschild Zionists launched a ‘think tank’ before Bush came to office calledthe Project for the New American Century (PNAC). Bush Defense Secretary, DonaldRumsfeld, and Vice President Dick Cheney, both vehement supporters of Israel,were also involved along with the president’s brother, Jeb Bush. The Project forthe New American Century published a document in September 2000 calledRebuilding America\"s Defenses: Strategies, Forces and Resources for a NewCentury. This called for American forces to ‘fight and decisively win multiple,simultaneous major theater wars’ with emphasis on places like Iraq, Iran andNorth Korea. But the document said that they would not be able to sell suchoverseas wars without a good excuse. The document said that the ‘… process oftransformation … is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic andcatalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor’. One year to the month after thatdocument was published, and nine months after most of these Rothschild Zionistscame to power in the Bush administration, America did indeed suffer what Bushcalled ‘our Pearl Harbor’. The attacks were then exploited to justify the agendalaid out in the Rothschild Zionist document. It was so blatant.Bush’s State of the Union address in 2002 which described Iraq, Iran and NorthKorea as the ‘axis of evil’ was written by the neocon, David Frum (RothschildZionist), and this was straight from the pages of the Project for the NewAmerican Century plan for multiple overseas wars. The document also mentionedLibya as a country to target. The official 9/11 Commission ‘investigation’ intowhat happened that day was only forced upon Bush and Cheney kicking andscreaming, and the man they first appointed to head the Commission was HenryKissinger (Rothschild Zionist). This was ludicrous and incredible even for themand he had to resign, citing ‘conflicts of interest’. This had never stopped himbefore. The ‘investigation’ and the final report was overseen by Philip Zelikow(Rothschild Zionist) and the report declared that the official story was truewhile failing to interview or quote key witnesses that gave another version ofevents. The federal judge assigned to deal with all wrongful death and personalinjury cases filed by the families of those who died on September 11th was AlvinK Hellerstein (Rothschild Zionist), who has major family ties to Israel.Attorney Kenneth Feinberg (Rothschild Zionist) oversaw the 9/11 victims’compensation fund and 97 per cent of the families were persuaded to take themoney in exchange for not pressing for an independent investigation of theSeptember 11th atrocities. Those that did demand an investigation or rejectedthe limitations of the compensation fund were dealt with through a ‘specialmediator’, Sheila Birnbaum (Rothschild Zionist). Feinberg (Rothschild Zionist)went on to become the ‘Special Master’ for TARP Executive Compensation relatedto the bank bailouts, and the government-appointed administrator of thecompensation fund for victims of the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Irepeat: Jewish people make up only around two per cent of the Americanpopulation and many of those will not be Rothschild Zionists. Their ratio topositions of power is simply stunning, and I am only highlighting here what youmight call a ‘headline list’. It goes much deeper. By the way, the Project forthe New American Century document also called for the development of ‘advancedforms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes …’ These are thepeople who call others ‘racist’. They are beyond sick. The Project for the NewAmerican Century was widely exposed in the alternative media, and as a result ithas changed its name to the Foreign Policy Initiative.CONTROLLING ‘INVESTIGATION’ (DON’T HAVE ONE) AND ‘SECURITY’ (DON’T HAVE ANY)Israel, and Rothschild Zionism, is the elephant in the living room time aftertime after time. The CIA was headed by George John Tenet (Rothschild Zionist)across 9/11, and the ‘investigation’ into the attacks was overseen by AssistantAttorney General Michael Chertoff (Rothschild Zionist, London School ofEconomics), the son of a Mossad agent. Chertoff co-authored the notoriousPatriot Act which deleted basic rights and freedoms on the justification of9/11; then he became the second head of Homeland Security, an organisationestablished in response to 9/11. The Pentagon in this period was controlled bypeople such as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz (Rothschild Zionist), whowent on to head the World Bank, and Dov Zakheim (Rothschild Zionist), bothmembers of the Project for the New American Century. Zakheim is a dualIsraeli–American citizen and he was the Pentagon Comptroller who managed to‘lose’ trillions from the Pentagon budget – a fact that was announced onSeptember 10th, 2001. Anyone wonder why this extraordinary revelation was notwidely reported? Did something happen the next day or something? But, it had tobe a coincidence, surely? Zakheim also wrongly classified squads of US F-15 andF-16 fighter jets as military surplus so they could be sold to Israel at aknock-down price (and bought with American ‘aid’ money, anyway). This, and othermilitary sales (often gifts), means that Israel has one of the best-equippedarmed forces on the planet with which to ‘defend’ a population of onlyseven-and-a-half million. This is ridiculous, but the Israeli military and thenuclear arsenal have been accumulated for far more than ‘defence’. They areplanned to be used in wars of expansion and to threaten the world with nuclearattack if the spoilt brat doesn’t get its way. Israeli establishment militaryhistorian, Martin van Creveld, has said that Israel may be forced one day toexterminate the European continent using its nuclear capability and all kinds ofother weapons if it felt its existence was threatened. He said that Israelconsiders Europe a hostile target: ‘We have hundreds of nuclear warheads andmissiles that can reach different targets in the heart of the Europeancontinent, including beyond the borders of Rome, the Italian capital.’ Creveldsaid that most European capitals would become targets for the Israeli air force.These people are mentally ill – and they have nuclear weapons that they won’tallow to be inspected, and refuse to sign the non-proliferation treaty. Whatdoes the ‘International Community’ do about this? Guess.Israel also has a massive chemical and biological weapons programme based at theIsraeli Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), southeast of Tel Aviv, and themilitary censor the Israeli media from revealing anything about it. Threehundred scientists are employed to research and develop horrific chemical andbiological ‘weapons’ and laboratory-created diseases to unleash on the globalpopulation. They are also used to assassinate targets while making it appearthat they have died from ‘natural causes’. I’m sure that those scientists arealso producing what the neocons called biological weapons to kill ‘specificgenotypes’. The Rothschilds, via Israel, are at war with the world on behalf ofthe Reptilian Alliance. They should be in jail and the key somewheremid-Atlantic. Ask yourself why a country of seven-and-a-half million peoplewould have one of the world’s best-equipped militaries, a nuclear stockpile anda vast chemical and biological weapons programme. For protection? No. Forattack. This is all paid for by American taxpayers via the RothschildZionist-controlled US government and the devastating destructive capability isalso in the hands of people who are bloody nuts. In 2011, a rabbinical court inJerusalem condemned a dog to death by stoning on the grounds that it wassuspected of being the reincarnation of a secular lawyer who insulted thecourt’s judges two decades earlier. If you are reading this on April 1st, it ispurely coincidental. This is not a joke. Well, it is, but you know what I mean.The large dog found its way into the Monetary Affairs Court in theultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Mea Shearim and frightened judges. One ofthem remembered that the court had inflicted a curse on the lawyer who had once‘insulted’ the judges. Not possible, surely. The curse had decreed that thelawyer’s spirit would enter a dog – an animal considered impure by traditionalJudaism. They decided that the dog in the court was the lawyer and ruled thatthe canine, er, ‘lawyer’, should be stoned to death by local children. The dogescaped its fate, thank goodness, when an animal welfare organisation filed apolice complaint against the head of the court, Rabbi Avraham Dov Levin. Irepeat: this mentality has a nuclear arsenal and chemical and biologicalweapons. Sleep well.Security at the World Trade Center at the time of 9/11was the responsibility ofthe Rothschild Zionist-owned Kroll Inc. This has very close links to the CIA andMossad, and its current chairman, William Bratton, was called in by BritishPrime Minister, David Cameron, after the riots of 2011. Security at all three9/11 airports was run by ICTS International and its subsidiary, HuntleighCorporation, which are companies owned by Rothschild Zionists, Ezra Harel andMenachem Atzmon. They are also dominated by ‘former’ agents of Israel’s domesticsecurity service and counter-Intelligence agency, Shin Bet, which handlessecurity for the Israeli airline, EL AL. ICTS International was established in1982 and is responsible for ‘security’ at all the 9/11 airports; Charles deGaulle Airport in Paris, where ‘shoe bomber’, Richard Reid, boarded his plane;and Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where ‘underpants bomber’, Umar FaroukAbdulmutallab, was allowed to board his aircraft without a passport and despitea string of other red flags. As a result of all these Rothschild Zionist‘security lapses’, we have a police state, horrendous airport ‘security’ andfull-body radiation scanners promoted by Rothschild Zionist Michael Chertoff,who owns the Chertoff Group. This is a ‘risk management and security consultingfirm’ that employs several senior colleagues from Homeland Security and alsoMichael Hayden, a former Director of the National Security Agency and the CIA.Chertoff was all over the TV networks after the engineered ‘underpants bomber’incident, urging the government to introduce full-body radiation scanners (Fig256). These are produced by one of the Chertoff Group’s clients, RapiscanSystems. Hours before Congress voted on the first Patriot Act (justified by 9/11and co-written by Chertoff), some ‘technical corrections’ were added to giveforeign security companies such as ICTS International immunity from lawsuitsrelated to 9/11. This meant that ICTS International would not have to bequestioned in court or explain what happened to surveillance tapes at the 9/11airports that went ‘mysteriously’ missing, and why key cameras were not working.Marvin Bush, brother of Boy Bush, was also a principal with Securacom, a companythat provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and DullesInternational Airport. The attacks on the Twin Towers came only days after aheightened security alarm was lifted and bomb-sniffing dogs were removed. Overthe weekend of September 8th and 9th the power went down in the South Tower forsome 36 hours from floor 50 upwards and so security cameras and doors were notworking in the upper floors during this period.image [../Images/00324.jpg] Figure 256: Michael Chertoff – doing his god’s work Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) ‘WE WENT TO DOCUMENT THE EVENT’Then there is the story of the five ‘dancing Israelis’ who were arrested afterpolice received several calls from New Jersey residents outraged that‘Middle-Eastern’ men were high-fiving, whooping and cheering as they videotapedthe burning Twin Towers and they were reported to have started filming beforethe planes struck. ‘They were like, happy, you know … They didn’t look shockedto me,’ one witness said. Police and FBI officers discovered maps of New York intheir white van, with locations highlighted, and also $4,700 in cash hidden in asock, foreign passports, and boxcutters of the type alleged to have been used bythe ‘Arab hi-jackers’. It was further reported that sniffer dogs found traces ofexplosives in the van, which belonged to a Mossad front company called UrbanMoving Systems owned by Dominick Suter (Rothschild Zionist). He droppedeverything (literally, judging by the haste the office was evacuated) and fledback to Israel immediately after the attacks. Jewish newspaper, The Forward,said the FBI discovered that at least two of the five arrested Israelis wereMossad agents, and that Urban Moving Systems was a Mossad front operation. Thefive were held for 71 days, but released without charge and allowed to return toIsrael where three of them appeared on television to say that ‘our purpose wasto document the event’ (Fig 257). Yes, the event they knew was going to happen.Mossad is the world expert at staging fake terrorist attacks and blaming someoneit wants to demonise. Dr Alan Sabrosky, former Director of Studies at the USArmy War College, has said publicly that US military leaders know that ‘Israeland those traitors within our nation’ were responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Ihave already mentioned that since the attacks we have been subjected to a seriesof ‘Bin Laden’ videos and other ‘information’ promoting fear of Arab terrorismfrom two organisations called IntelCenter and SITE, or the Search forInternational Terrorist Entities Institute. IntelCenter is run by Ben Venzke(Rothschild Zionist), and SITE was co-founded by Rita Katz (Rothschild Zionist).Writers, Gordon Duff and Brian Jobert, ask some key questions in an articleheadlined: Is Israel Controlling Phony Terror News?:image [../Images/00325.jpg] Figure 257: Three of the five ‘dancing Israelis’ tell an Israel television show:‘Our purpose was to document the event’ > Who says Al Qaeda takes credit for a bombing?

Amazing. Not quite so amazing if you have read this far and seen the extent to which theRothschild Zionist secret-society networks control and manipulate world events.Rothschild Zionists, Katz and Venzke, provided ‘Intelligence’ and Bin Ladenvideos for ‘security’ agencies and the media; and Adam Gadahn, an allegedspokesman for ‘Al-Qaeda’, released videos of himself supporting terrorism. Hisname is on the FBI ‘most wanted’ terrorist list. How strange then that ‘AdamGadahn’ turns out to be a Jewish man called Adam Pearlman, grandson of CarlPearlman, who served on the Board of the rabid Rothschild ZionistAnti-Defamation League (ADL). The Chairman of the US Homeland Security andGovernmental Affairs Committee is Senator Joseph Lieberman (Rothschild Zionist),and he is always using the ‘threat of terrorism’ to censor the Internet to blockthe truth from coming out.FUKUSHIMA: THE SAME OLD STORYEvery surveillance company and military producer and supplier in Israel iscontrolled by the Rothschild Intelligence and enforcement operation, Mossad.This includes ICTS International and another company, Magna BSP, which installed‘security’ systems at the Fukushima nuclear complex in Japan before the disasterof March 2011, following the earthquake and tsunami. Fukushima is a catastrophebeyond measure, not only for the devastated Japan, but for the world. It is hardto see a long term future for Japan with the scale of radioactive release oversuch a period. Some were saying that the scale of radiation released by thesummer of 2011 was already 50 times worse than that of Chernobyl in the Ukrainein 1986. As I write, it is still pouring out into the air and sea with noimmediate prospect of it stopping. The official story of what happened atFukushima makes no sense at all. Neither flooding from the tsunami or damagefrom the earthquake could explain the series of events that followed. Theauthorities blamed a build-up of hydrogen for the explosion in Reactor 3 afterthe tsunami struck, but Fukushima had technology that would have dealt withthat, and it didn’t need electricity to do so. Fukushima’s Reactor 4 explodedeven though it was not operational and had been de-fuelled. How could it haveexploded? Reactors 5 and 6 were also in cold shut-down awaiting maintenance andonly Reactors 1, 2 and 3 were operational. You can see the explosion inFukushima Reactor 3 on the left in Figure 258[../Text/index_split_122.html#filepos975910], while on the right is a picture ofwhat happens with a small nuclear explosion. The radiation disaster at Fukushimawas triggered by a nuclear device placed inside Reactor 3. The closed-downReactor 4 could also only have exploded by artificial means. Giant securitycameras and sensors were installed inside Reactor 3 and elsewhere on theFukushima site by the Israeli company, Magna BSP, about a year before thedisaster. It also had personnel at the site at the time, and surviving camerascontinued to film events. Magna BSP specialises in producing ‘virtual securityfences’ for military and civilian use that include an ‘electro-optical radarsystem’ and ‘stereoscopic vision sensors’. The cameras weighed more than 1,000lbs and were of a size and shape very similar to a gun-type nuclear weapon (Fig259 [../Text/index_split_124.html#filepos976419]). Magna BSP is located inDimona in Israel – the home of the massive Israeli nuclear weapons programme.Magna BSP’s ‘virtual wall’ system is called the Optical Watch Line, or ‘Owl’.The ‘owl’ to these symbol-obsessed people is the Illuminati symbol for their godof sacrifice known as ‘Moloch’ which is worshipped by the El-ite at BohemianGrove in Northern California in the form of a 40-foot-tall stone owl. Childrenin the ancient world were sacrificed by fire to Moloch, and even the Biblementions the fact. The official Fukushima story is a fantasy from start tofinish, as is the one for 9/11. This was the official statement in June 2011about the condition of Fukushima Reactor 3:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00326.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00327.jpg]Figure 258: An explosion at Fukushima, and a small nuclear explosion.

You can see the state of Reactor 3 at the time that statement was made in Fig260. There was virtually nothing left of it. Freelance journalist, Jim Stone,has done some excellent research on the background to Fukushima, and his websiteis: www.jimstonefreelance.com [http://www.jimstonefreelance.com]. The fact thatthe destruction of Fukushima was not a ‘natural’ event means that the earthquakeand tsunami were not ‘natural’ events either. They clearly weren’t going toplace nuclear devices in position and then sit around hoping for an earthquakeand tsunami to turn up. I’ll explain later how they triggered the earthquake andits deadly consequences. I had finished this chapter and ‘gone public’ with myview that Fukushima was caused by nuclear devices when I came across a videopresentation by nuclear engineer, Arnie Gundersen, at the Boston Public Library.He was saying that Fukushima had provided new evidence of what could happen atany nuclear power station. He showed step-by-step still pictures of an explosionat Fukushima and said that no one could explain how the wave could have moved atsome 1,000 miles an hour – substantially faster than the speed of sound. He saidthat this made the explosion a ‘detonation wave’ and this was unexplainable,because hydrogen and oxygen should only be able to produce a subsonic‘deflagration’ wave. He said: > No one knows why this happened. Hydrogen and oxygen at room pressures> shouldn’t detonate. I was talking to a bunch of chemists and we couldn’t> figure out how it could detonate. It could deflagrate, but it shouldn’t be> able to detonate and that has major ramifications on containment design. I can understand why he and the chemists said that. They were trying to explainwhat happened from a nuclear reactor perspective when the explosion was causedby a nuclear weapon – hence it was a detonation wave and not a deflagration. Theonly ‘ramifications for containment design’ are not to have your security systeminstalled and managed by a company based at the same location as Israel’snuclear weapons programme.OWNING THE HACKS AND THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLERothschild Zionists have kept exposure from the door, up until now, throughownership of the mainstream media. Shahar Ilan, a daily features editor with theleading Israeli newspaper, Ha’aretz, wrote: ‘The Jews [Rothschild Zionists] docontrol the American media. This is very clear, and claiming otherwise is aninsult to common knowledge.’ The US National Archives declassified in 2011 thefindings of a ‘sealed’ Senate investigation into the $36 million spent byIsraeli organisations to plant stories in the American media to promote theforeign policy objectives of the Rothschild Zionists. The Atlantic Magazine wasa major recipient of the money. The paid-for stories included divertingattention from Israel’s Dimona nuclear weapons facility by describing it as a‘research centre’ and pressing for a US attack on Iran’s nuclear sites byclaiming they were part of a nuclear weapons programme. Major US publications‘fell into line’ as the sleazy prostitutes that they are. The Senate transcriptof the investigation had been ‘sealed’ to stop the findings being made publicand congratulations to the National Archives for releasing the documents. Thisis a classic confirmation of the Rothschild Zionist control of both the Americanpolitical system and the media. Not only in America, either, and not only the‘news’ media of Rothschild Zionist moguls like Rupert Murdoch. Los Angeles Timescolumnist, Joel Stein (Rothschild Zionist), wrote an article proclaiming thatAmericans who don’t think Jews (Rothschild Zionists) control Hollywood are justplain ‘dumb’:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00330.jpg] Figure 261: Rothschild Zionist Hollywood Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) > I had to scour the trades to come up with six Gentiles in high positions at> entertainment companies. But lo and behold, even one of that six, AMC> President Charles Collier, turned out to be a Jew! … As a proud Jew, I want> America to know of our accomplishment. Yes, we control Hollywood. ‘Tinseltown’ has been used to sell false versions of historical events and toprogram perceptions all over the world. It is obvious that the bloodlines wouldhave created it, never mind own it (Fig 261). Hollywood movies and televisionare used to manipulate reality and program people mentally and emotionallybefore events that the bloodlines are preparing to create. Six months before9/11 came a pilot episode in The Lone Gunmen series that involved the controlsof a commercial airliner being remotely taken over and the plane aimed at theWorld Trade Center. Sources within the production team have apparently said thatthe CIA gave them the plot idea. As I write, a film called Contagion about adeadly mass plague and the US Centers for Disease Control is being promoted –more Hollywood foreknowledge of another attack on humanity that the bloodlinesare waiting to roll out. Rothschild Zionists also control the Internet. Google,Yahoo, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, eBay etc., etc., were alleither created or are controlled by Rothschild Zionists – often both. I have tosmile when I see these scandals come to light about search engines, networkingsites and cell-phone companies, trawling and retaining information about theirusers. The companies are then all aghast that this is happening, or they makesome lame excuse for why it was done. They do it because they are vehicles forthe Rothschild Zionist secret society and its connecting networks of othersecret societies, Satanists and paedophiles. The logo and mascots for the 2012Olympic Games in London are obviously symbolising ‘Zion’ (Saturn) and theall-seeing eye (Fig 262 [../Text/index_split_127.html#filepos986482]). Themoment I heard that London had bid for the 2012 Olympics I said to my family andfriends that I was sure they would win. London and 2012 were just toosynchronistic for this not to have been planned and there has to be a bloodlinereason why they wanted the Games in London at that time. I suspect there will bemany engineered events in 2012, a year that has been so nonsensically hyped. Iwill go into this further towards the end of the book. I emphasise again that weare not talking here about ‘the Jews’ owning the media, Hollywood, the Internet,politics, banking and big business, but a tiny clique answering to the secretsociety that is Rothschild Zionism. The mass of Jewish people have beenmercilessly used and abused by the Rothschild networks that don’t give a damnabout them. Rothschild Zionism is not pursuing what is best for Jewish people asa whole, but what suits the Rothschild conspiracy, and therefore the ReptilianAlliance conspiracy, for global domination. The Rothschilds and their Zionistsecret-society web control American government policy on everything, and thesituation is the same in Britain and country after country, and in the EuropeanUnion, which was a Rothschild creation from the start. Rothschild dual controlof America and Israel has led to astonishing amounts of American tax dollarsbeing transferred to Israel in military and financial ‘aid’. One arm of theRothschilds is simply giving it to another. John J Mearsheimer and Stephen MWalt write in their book, The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy (Penguin;2008):"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00331.jpg] Figure 262: Zion and the all-seeing eye at the London Olympic Games in 2012 > Israel receives about $3 billion in direct foreign assistance each year, which> is roughly one-fifth of America’s entire foreign aid budget. In per capita> terms, the United States gives each Israeli a direct subsidy worth about $500> per year. This largesse is especially striking when one realizes that Israel> is now a wealthy industrial state with a per capita income roughly equal to> South Korea or Spain. Richard Falk, professor of international law at Princeton University, said:‘Israel receives more economic assistance than all the countries combined in theworld.’ Yet, at the same time, the US General Accounting Office (now theGovernment Accountability Office) is reported to have said that Israel ‘conductsthe most aggressive espionage operations against the US of any ally’. They areno ‘ally’ of the American people, only hijackers of their country. The US Houseof Representatives approved another $205 million in military aid for Israel foran ‘anti-missile’ system. ‘When it comes to defence, military, and Intelligencecooperation, the relationship between the US and Israel has never beenstronger,’ said Democrat Representative Steve Rothman (Rothschild Zionist), amember of the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee. As he spoke, theIsraeli authorities were using their American-supplied military might tocontinue the blockade of the Gaza Strip which has been stopping supplies offood, fuel and basic needs for 1.5 million Palestinians since 2007. Also,despite the massive foreign aid for Israel, the Israeli people have begun streetprotests, as I write, over financial hardship and poverty. Four hundred thousandpeople went to the streets of Israel on one day to protest against governmentpolicy and inadequate wages. They need to come together with the Palestiniansand all of us challenging the force that targets us all – the Illuminatibloodlines and their ruthless network that includes Rothschild Zionism. We needto put aside the irrelevant divisions of race, religion, culture and incomebracket and let peace, justice and fairness for all be our focus of unity. TheRothschild Zionist El-ite are hoarding the billions in ‘aid’ money forthemselves in Israel and to buy still more weapons. They could not care lessabout the mass of Jewish people – as the plight of so many Israelis confirms. Ihave set out here to reveal the true face of Zionism – the House of Rothschildand its networks – and how its agents in Big Government, Big Banking, BigBusiness, Big Pharma, Big Biotech, Big Food and Big Media and so on, are workingas one unit to impose a global Orwellian dictatorship on the human population,including the mass of Jewish people. Zionism is a subject that all but a few areeither too ignorant or too frightened to tackle and expose, but it must be madepublic and the web dismantled if global tyranny is to be avoided in the verynear future. In fact, it’s not even about the ‘future’. The tyranny is alreadyhere and it is just a case of how deeply we are going to allow ourselves to beenslaved by it. The Rothschilds have spent a century hiding the true andever-gathering extent of their global control behind front organisations andrepresentatives, and that veil must be lifted for the mass of the people to see.They have operated from the shadows for long enough, and we must urgently ensurethat those days are over.The Rothschilds have a whole army of organisations to target anyone who getsanywhere near the truth as an ‘anti-Semite’, which, ironically, means‘anti-Arab’; but that’s another story you can read about in my other books.Rothschild ‘call-them-racist’ fronts include the Anti-Defamation League (ADL),which, in true Orwellian fashion, goes around defaming people (Fig 263). Theyalso have B’nai B’rith (Sons of the Covenant), the Simon Wiesenthal Center(named after a complete fraud) and networks in every country like the CanadianJewish Congress (CJC) which was exposed for raising the profile of the CanadianNazi Party to justify its own miserable existence. The CJC was still being runby an angry man called Bernie Farber the last time I looked. He doesn’t seem tolike me. I can’t think why. Mind you, he’s a friend of that Richard Warman chapand he doesn’t send me a Christmas card either. I’m hurt. These are just some ofthe organisations behind the widespread introduction of ‘hate laws’ to banfreedom of expression and the exposure of the masters they all represent. Theselaws are promoted as ‘protecting minorities’, when the Rothschilds and theirsleazy Saturnian cult couldn’t give a shit about minorities – or majorities,come to that. They are only interested in total control. More and more laws arebeing introduced to make any criticism of Israel constitute a ‘crime’ ofanti-Semitism. A long list of magnificent and courageous Jewish people havespoken out against the Rothschild Zionists, such as Norman Finkelstein, andmusician and writer, Gilad Atzmon. Finkelstein had his academic career destroyedby them for exposing the horrors inflicted by Israel on the Palestinians and theway the Rothschild Zionist El-ite are scamming Jewish people in general. See hisbrilliant book, The Holocaust Industry (Verso; 2003) and also Gilad Atzmon’s TheWandering Who?: A Study of Jewish Identity Politics (Zero Books; 2011). Theycan’t credibly call these Jewish critics ‘anti-Semites’, so they refer to themas ‘self-haters’ instead. Well, they can say what they like about me, and theyhave, but I am not going to be silenced. There is too much at stake, especiallyfor our children and grandchildren.image [../Images/00332.jpg] Figure 263: The Rothschild attack-dog, the Anti-Defamation League, whose modusoperandi is to defame people Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) We need to look under every stone, especially the biggest ones, no matter whatthe reaction and consequences. Either we are pursuing the truth, or we’re not.And if you look under the stone marked ‘Rothschild Zionist Israel’, you willfind a man with a fake smile still working on his birth certificate.Postscript: It was announced in January 2012 that Jacob Lew (RothschildZionist), the US Budget Director, was to become Barack Obama’s White House ChiefStaff (handler and fixer). Lew takes over after the short tenure of WilliamDaley who replaced long-time Obama handler and fixer, Rahm Emanuel."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00333.jpg] I am writing this in the summer of 2011, and many events will have happened inthe months before the book completes the production and printing stages andbegins to circulate. I can’t say precisely what they will be, but I can tell youthe themes and what they will be meant to achieve.The Reptilian Alliance and the hybrid bloodlines want to impose total control ona vastly-reduced human population within a jackboot structure of worldgovernment, world army, world central bank and single electronic currency. Itwants everybody microchipped by law and connected to a global computer networkand the Global Positioning System (GPS) – the satellite ‘spies in the sky’. Theplan is for every child to be microchipped at birth, and there are even moresinister reasons for the microchipping programme than electronic tracking. Iwill come to this later. They want control of all food production through ahandful of corporations controlled by the same force, and to ban all otherproduction of food – including any grown in your own garden. This would be doneon the grounds of ‘safety’, and through other excuses. Food from the corporationmonopolies would be genetically manipulated and full of chemical cocktails todestabilise people mentally, emotionally and physically. Organic food would bebanned, and so would any effective doses of vitamins and other supplements toprevent people from compensating for the lack of nutrition in thecorporation-dictated diet. The bloodline-controlled US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) designated walnuts as drugs in a letter to a company calledDiamond Foods which was proclaiming the health benefits of walnuts. The FDAsaid: ‘Your walnut products are drugs’ that may ‘not legally be marketed … inthe United States without an approved new drug application’. Insane – unless youknow the real reason behind it. The water supply is planned to be drugged tokeep the population docile and robotic, and to make people ‘love theirservitude’. There would be compulsory vaccinations to devastate the human immunesystem and open people to all kinds of diseases which are currently dealt with.A Nazi-like global police state would be imposed in which views that oppose theofficial line would be banned; the Internet would be severely censored; and asurveillance system would ensure that no-one could do anything without theauthorities knowing about it. This is already happening via the ‘TotalitarianTiptoe’. People would be told where they are going to live, where they are goingto work, and for how many hours and at what pay. The war on trade unions is apart of this. There would be compulsory conscription into the world army,fighting perpetual wars against phantom enemies. A drugged and microchippedpopulation would be nothing more than robots and computer terminals on thecontrol grid of the Saturn-worshipping El-ite. Parents would lose control oftheir children to the State. This is another reason why children are being takenfrom loving parents for no credible reason. If anyone thinks that what I amsaying is extreme and ridiculous – look around you. The very society that I amdescribing was featured in two ‘prophetic’ novels published in the first half ofthe 20th century: George Orwell’s 1984, and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.Combine the two and you have the major themes of what is planned, and much ofwhat they say is clearly happening today. Were these remarkable examples ofprophecy only a lucky guess? Oh, no. Orwell and Huxley knew what was coming –unless it was stopped.ENCODING THE ‘FUTURE’I have been emphasising for so many years the scale and coordination of theconspiracy that humanity is dealing with. Those who manipulate and exploit ourworld are not making it up by the day, month, year or even decade. They areplaying out a programme encoded in the very fabric of our experienced reality.The World Trade Center Twin Towers were built in the late 1960s, knowing whattheir fate would be in 2001. The liberty flame and black pentagram that is now ashrine to Princess Diana above the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris were placedthere in 1989, knowing what they would symbolise after 1997. I know that this ishard for people to accept; but it’s the truth. Remember that we are not onlydealing with an ‘earthly’ conspiracy here. The bloodlines of the Illuminati areonly vehicles for their ‘off-world’ masters. The script for what is happeningtoday was written a long, long time ago, certainly hundreds and possiblythousands of years ago. No, I’m not kidding and I haven’t had one drink, nevermind a bellyful. The global fascist/communist State is happening with suchcoordination because it is encoded in the broadcasts coming from Saturn andamplified by the Moon. If you have knowledge of this encoded information andwhere is it going – the plan – then you can write prophetic ‘novels’ that turnout to be incredibly accurate. George Orwell and Aldous Huxley were able to dothis with 1984 (published in 1948) and Brave New World (published in 1932),because they basically knew what was coming. Orwell (real name, Eric Blair)described the police state and surveillance society and a never-ending war tokeep people in line. This is exactly what we are seeing today. The never-endingwar is the ‘War on Terror’. How can you ever say that you have won a ‘War onTerror’? You can’t. The story may be bogus, but if people believe that it’s truethen you are home and dry. Aldous Huxley described in Brave New World how drugsand genetics would be used to control the population, and how parents would losethe right to bring up their children or eventually even give them life throughprocreation. They would instead be created in batches in ‘World Statehatcheries’ and systemically programmed from birth. Much of what Huxley said isnow happening, and the constant erosion and loss of parental rights to the Stateis one of the stepping stones to the rest. Orwell was taught French by Huxley atthe El-ite Eton College near Windsor Castle just outside London, where the royalchildren are sent to be programmed. They became friends, and Huxley introducedOrwell to the Fabian Society. This is a major secret society in the Illuminatiweb and this was the information source for their ‘novels’ that have turned outto be so accurate.The Fabian Society was established in 1884 to manipulate the ‘Left’ in politics,while other secret societies look after the ‘Right’ and ‘Centre’ to polarisedebate, divide and rule, and give the illusion of political choice. The FabianSociety created the British Labour Party of Tony Blair – and the Australianversion – and it operates around the world under various guises. AustralianPrime Minister, Julia Gillard, is a Fabian initiate and she replaced Kevin Rudd,now the Foreign Minister and another Fabian. They are taking Australians in thedirection dictated by their Fabian controllers, but, then, so did the LiberalParty bloodline servant, John Howard, when he was the Australian Prime Minister.This is the way it works – masks on the same face claiming to be different inorder to maintain the illusion. Australia, like New Zealand and Canada, is alsoa fiefdom of the Rothschild Zionists with their shills such as Gillard andHoward placed into apparent power to do their bidding. The Fabian Society(ultimately Rothschild Zionism) created and controls the El-ite University ofthe ‘Left’, the London School of Economics (LSE), which produces so many‘left-wing’ politicians and other bloodline agents to serve the agenda inBritain, the United States and elsewhere. David Rockefeller (Rothschild Zionist)was a student, and so was ‘shapeshifter’ and ‘Anunnaki’ author, Zecharia Sitchin(Rothschild Zionist). Two other LSE students were Dov Zackiem (RothschildZionist), the 9/11 Pentagon comptroller who lost those trillions of dollars; andMichael Chertoff (Rothschild Zionist), who co-wrote the freedom-busting PatriotAct, was the second head of US Homeland Security, and sold full-body radiationscanners to the world. Billionaire financier George Soros, the Rothschild asset,was a student at the LSE and has made very large donations to its cause. TheLondon School of Economics is run by a ‘Court of Governors’ which, at the timeof writing, includes people such as Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, one of thedynasty’s premier operatives; Peter D Sutherland, a major player in theBilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission member, a chairman of BP and GoldmanSachs International, financial advisor to the Vatican (the same as Evelyn deRothschild) and former Director General of the Rothschild-Rockefeller WorldTrade Organization (WTO); Cherie Blair (wife of Fabian, Tony); and ShamiChakrabarti, a former student at the LSE, who is now the head of ‘Liberty’. Thisis the most prominent ‘defender of freedom and civil rights’ in Britain, but isactually next to bloody useless. The Fabian logo is a wolf in sheep’s clothing(which is exactly what it is) and the name comes from ‘Fabius’, the Romangeneral, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, who was famous for the technique ofwearing down the enemy over long periods and avoiding battles that could provedecisive either way – the Totalitarian Tiptoe (Fig 264). The inner sanctum ofthe Fabian Society would have had the projected script at the time that Huxleyand Orwell were involved, and they knew what was planned because the FabianSociety knew what was planned. It seems that Orwell wrote 1984 in an effort toexpose the plot. The year 1984 was the 100th anniversary of the Fabian Society.We have also had a powerful confirmation of long-term planning from aRockefeller family insider called Dr Richard Day (Rothschild Zionist), whoaccurately described in detail in 1969 what is happening today. I’ll tell youabout what he said later in the book.image [../Images/00334.jpg] Figure 264: The Fabian Society: a wolf in sheep’s clothing So it is no coincidence that it was David Rockefeller (Rothschild Zionist) whoproposed to the New York Port Authority that the Twin Towers should be built inthe late 1960s, or that American money via the International Herald Tribune inthe 1980s located the full-sized replica of the Statue of Liberty flame on ablack pentagram over the tunnel in Paris where Princess Diana would meet herfate. The International Herald Tribune was jointly-owned at the time by theOchs–Sulzberger family (Rothschild Zionists) and the Meyer–Graham family(Rothschild Zionists). More than 30 years after David Rockefeller (RothschildZionist) proposed to the New York Port Authority that the Twin Towers be built,Ronald S Lauder (Rothschild Zionist) from the Estée Lauder cosmetics familylobbied the Port Authority to sell the lease of the Towers into private handsfor the first time in 2001. Lewis Eisenberg (Rothschild Zionist), head of theNew York Port Authority, agreed, and the lease was purchased by LarrySilverstein (Rothschild Zionist) and Frank Lowy (Rothschild Zionist) who vastlyincreased the insurance in the event of a terrorist attack. Weeks after theybought the lease came the engineered 9/11 atrocities in which Rothschild Zionistglobal enforcers Mossad were centrally involved, and their task was made easierby Rothschild Zionist companies handling the security at the World Trade Centerand all the 9/11 airports. The attacks were then used as the excuse to impose apolice state, and to invade target countries listed in the policy documentpublished in September 2000 by the Rothschild Zionist Project for the NewAmerican Century. No, they don’t make it up as they go along.WORLD EVENTS AS THEY REALLY AREThe script was written long ago and it is now being delivered by the day. Thechallenge for the people is to rip it up. Events in North Africa that began in2011 are just scenes in a movie to justify the acquisition of more and morecountries and lead the world into World War III, after which the fully-fledgedglobal fascist/communist state is planned to be rolled out. I sat in a hotelroom in Kiev, Ukraine, watching the demise of Egypt’s President Mubarak live onAl Jazeera television and the incredible scenes of joy and jubilation thatimmediately followed (Fig 265 [../Text/index_split_129.html#filepos1011315]).What a moment it was for those people who had suffered so much physically andeconomically under the 30-year military tyranny of Mubarak and hishenchmen-in-uniform. Who could not be moved by the outpouring of relief andhappiness that went on throughout the night? But what did the morning actuallybring? There had been no revolution – only the removal of a despicable frontman.The army which had imposed the will of Mubarak (the will ofAmerica/Israel/Rothschilds) for three decades was now in charge. The Egyptianarmy is not only controlled by the US government (the Rothschilds), it is paidfor by the $1.5 billion a year in American military ‘aid’. This has been secondonly to the $3 billion (and then some) which American taxpayers are forced togive to Israel to fund the suppression and systematic genocide of thePalestinians – and a bigger plan that we are yet to see. The man in charge ofthe Egyptian army – and the country after the ‘revolution’ – was General MohamedHussein Tantawi. He is a life-long friend of the toppled Mubarak and one of hisclosest associates in his three decades of tyranny. Tantawi was ‘DefenceMinister’ (mass killer) for two decades and enforced Mubarak’s reign of terroragainst the Egyptian people together with Omar Suleiman, the torturing,murdering head of Egyptian General Intelligence. He was still on the scene afterthe ‘people’s revolution’. The army then announced that it was going to chargeand question Mubarak about crimes against the people and related matters. Whowas doing the charging and the questioning? The very people who carried out thecrimes against the people! You couldn’t make it up; but then, in this world, youdon’t have to. The United States government owns the Egyptian military, and whenthe US says jump, the uniforms break the Olympic high jump record. Much has beenmade of the army not firing on the demonstrators, but at the same time thearmy’s masters in America were calling for Mubarak to step down and for theprotestors to be left alone. Whatever America (the Rothschild networks) demandsof the Egyptian military, it will do. The army cleared demonstrators from theTahrir Square in Cairo once the eyes of the world had gone away. There was notimetable for the ‘free and fair elections’ that the army promised, but theysaid they would remain in charge for at least six months or more. What happenedin Egypt was the blueprint for the illusion of ‘people’s uprisings’ that arebeing used to impose even greater control. Taking over too many countries byopen invasion would make what is happening too obvious; but if you manipulatepeople to ‘revolt’ under your control then you can trigger the upheavals andregime-change that you seek under the cover of ‘freedom’ and ‘power to thepeople’."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00335.jpg] Figure 265: Thousands of genuine protestors in Cairo directed from the shadows This is a speciality of billionaire financier, George Soros (RothschildZionist), in league with the equally appalling Zbigniew Brzezinski (RothschildZionist), co-founder of the Trilateral Commission and handler to Barack Obama(Fig 266 [../Text/index_split_130.html#filepos1014964]). Soros manipulates‘people’s revolutions’ through his network of trusts, institutes and suchlike.The Open Society Institute and the International Crisis Group are two of themost prominent, but there are many. Brzezinski is also a ‘people’s revolution’manipulator. He has admitted arming and funding the ‘freedom fighters’ inAfghanistan to entice the Soviet Union to invade at the cost of a million Afghanlives, and this created the Mujahedeen and the Taliban and brought Osama binLaden to prominence in support of a longer-term plan. It was appropriate that Iwas in Kiev, Ukraine, watching the celebrations in Egypt. Down the road fromwhere I was sitting was another square – Independence Square – where they hadsimilar celebrations in 2004 after a ‘people’s revolution’ (instigated by theSoros network) to remove President Viktor Yanukovych over alleged vote-rigging.But the Ukraine president when I was in the country for a speaking event just afew years later was the very same Viktor Yanukovych. I asked people how thiscould be and they just shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders. In fact,during a live interview that I did on Ukraine television, the interpreter wastold not to translate my words when I made this very point that there had beenno revolution in Ukraine given that the man they threw out is now back in power.It’s a free country, see. The reason such apparently bizarre happenings arepossible is that ‘democracy’ is not freedom, but they use these words asinterchangeable as if democracy really does mean freedom. It doesn’t. Obama andSecretary of State, Clinton, can’t say the two words often enough with regard tothe Middle East and Africa. They drone on day after day about the right to freeand democratic elections and all that stuff, but even at its best democracy isonly a tyranny of the majority. ‘Democracy’ is not even that most of the time.Winners, and therefore leaders, are often chosen by a minority of the populationwith a large slice of corruption thrown in. How can democracy give people choicewhen any party with a chance of winning is controlled by the same force? Thevery concept of political ‘parties’ was introduced by the bloodlines in thefirst place to secure their power to select leaders. This political partystructure in Ukraine was responsible for the bizarre outcome of a man thrown outin a ‘people’s revolution’ and El-ected back into office a few years later. The‘Orange Revolution’ in 2004 installed a guy called Viktor Yushchenko to replaceViktor Yanukovych, but when they lost faith with Yushchenko’s party the onlyother real choice in this ‘democracy’ was the party of Yanukovych, which he wasstill leading. Thus, he was back in the presidency. Political choice is purelyillusory."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00336.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00337.jpg]Figure 266: Soros and Brzezinski – Darth Vader is my friend THE GEORGE AND ZBIG SHOWGeorge Soros and Zbigniew Brzezinski were behind a series of ‘people’srevolutions’ in Eastern Europe designed to eventually bring those countriesunder the jackboot of the European Union and NATO. I have mentioned Ukraine, butthere was also the Czech Republic and Georgia where the Brzezinski-trainedMikheil Saakashvili was brought to power in 2003 by the ‘Revolution of Roses’that removed President Eduard Shevardnadze. The pathetic Saakashvili is agraduate of George Washington University in Washington D.C. and ColumbiaUniversity Law School in New York where Brzezinski headed the Institute onCommunist Affairs. Saakashvili is among many American-trained agents ingovernment that are controlled by the network of Soros and Brzezinski. The‘revolutions’ are manipulated through a complex web of foundations andorganisations working with other groups and agencies, including the CIA andMossad. The Open Society Institute and other Soros-connected groupings fundedand trained Georgian students in the art of mass protest, and financed theopposition TV station that encouraged the demonstrations. Zaza Gachechiladze,editor-in-chief of The Georgian Messenger, said that it was ‘generally acceptedpublic opinion here that Mr Soros is the person who planned Shevardnadze’soverthrow’. The same happened in the Czech Republic and Ukraine, and they tried,but failed, to instigate a ‘green revolution’ in Iran in 2009. The ‘red shirt’movement in Thailand supporting the ousted prime minister, the bloodline stoogeand crook, Thaksin Shinawatra, is also funded and supported by a network ofIlluminati organisations including the Soros Open Society Institute. Soros andhis associates are manipulating unrest and upheavel throughout the world.Another vehicle for manipulated revolutions is the Serbia-based Centre forApplied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS), headed by Srdja Popovic. Healso founded Otpor! ('Resistance!') with his associate, Ivan Marovic, who turnedup at the Wall Street protests in 2011, and CANVAS and Otpor! work as one. Theyoften use the symbol of the fist for the 'revolutionary' groups they train.Otpor! was funded by the United States and the Soros network to theoreticallyoverthrow the Yugoslavia regime of Slobodan Milošević in 2000 (the mass NATObombing helped just a little bit) and has continued its ‘revolutionary work’along with CANVAS in many other countries since that time funded by bloodlinefront organisations. It is now moving in on nations in the 'West', especiallythe United States. If these people, or any associates, are involved in yourprotest or 'revolution', it is not a 'revolution'. It is Cabal manipulated. Thisbrings us back to Egypt, where ‘revolutionaries’ such as Mohamed Adel of theApril 6 Youth Movement (with its fist symbol) were trained by CANVAS in Serbiaand flown to the United States in 2008 to meet US officials in New York. A guycalled Mohamed ElBaradei quickly boarded a plane from Austria when protestsbegan in Egypt and headed to ‘his people’. ElBaradei was on the Board ofTrustees of the George Soros ‘people’s revolution’-creating International CrisisGroup, a stablemate of the Open Society Institute. Another famous name connectedto the International Crisis Group … Zbigniew Brzezinski. ElBaradei suddenlyresigned from the organisation after he felt the urge to ‘join the revolution’,and within days of his plane touching down in Cairo he was one of the leaders ofthe protests and getting on so well with the Muslim Brotherhood – anotherbloodline creation (Fig 267 [../Text/index_split_132.html#filepos1019820]). Thisman works fast. You can see the type of a character he must be. He won the NobelPeace Prize when he was head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Say nomore. ElBaradei has said that he will stand for the Egyptian presidency when thearmy allows Elections; and he’s the El-ite’s man, or one of them. They havechoices."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00338.jpg] Figure 267: Mohamed ElBaradei – a Soros ‘revolutionary’ DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DOThe ‘revolutions’ in North Africa and the Middle East are being covertlyinstigated in line with a long-planned script (Fig 268[../Text/index_split_133.html#filepos1023676]). We don’t have ‘leaders’, we havereaders who parrot the words written by others whenever the Hidden Hand says‘cue’. Political gatherings like the G-8 or G-20 are merely readers conventions.‘What have you been told to say, Barack?’ ‘Oh, I have to condemn Syria, Nicolas,and you?’ I have to call for more power for the EU to fight the euro crisis.’ Itis pathetic to behold. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton once called thevicious and corrupt Mubarak in Egypt a ‘friend and ally’ of America and a‘personal friend’ of the Clinton family. Well, I guess like can attract like.But overnight her old buddy was the bad guy who had to go. Did she have aconversion on the road to Cairo? Did she see the light and realise that allpeople should be free of suppression and tyranny? What?? The Obama–Clintongovernment, as with the British and countless other ‘demon-ocracies’ around theworld, provides financial and military support to some of the most despicabletyrants on the planet. American money and arms kept Mubarak in power for threedecades, and he was warmly received by Obama at the White House (Fig 269[../Text/index_split_134.html#filepos1024308]). The Rothschild-controlled UnitedStates has a history of doing this pretty much since the country wasestablished, and it is imposing ever more tyranny and suppression on theAmerican people at home. They don’t give a damn about the people’s ‘rights’,except to delete them. How apt, then, that the word ‘demo’, as in demo-cracy,means to take away, to subtract, to remove. 71-year-old Ray McGovern was grabbedfrom the audience by police and plain-clothed thugs right in front of HillaryClinton before being ejected and beaten up while she was delivering one of herpuke-inducing speeches at George Washington University about the people’s rightto ‘freedom’ in the Middle East. What was Ray’s ‘crime’? The veteran armyofficer and 27-year CIA analyst simply wore a ‘Veterans for Peace’ T-shirt andsilently turned his back on Clinton as she spoke. This is thebutter-wouldn’t-melt America that inflicted disgusting treatment on 23-year-oldPrivate Bradley Manning after he was arrested on charges of supplying secretdocuments for WikiLeaks to make public. He was confined for 23 hours a day to asmall cell, with no personal possessions, and he was shackled and allowed nophysical contact during visits from his family and lawyer. This decent23-year-old man was deprived of sheets and a separate pillow and was preventedfrom exercising in his cell. He was allowed virtually no outdoor exercise, whichbreaches United Nations’ rules for the treatment of prisoners (Fig 270[../Text/index_split_135.html#filepos1024639]). Oh, but rules are for othercountries – not America, Britain or Israel. The most extreme levels of Orwellianimposition are increasing by the day right across the United States while thesedemonic liars talk about the need for freedoms elsewhere."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00339.jpg] Figure 268: ‘People’s revolutions’ in North Africa and the Middle East arecovertly manipulated, and genuine protestors are only pawns in a game they don’tunderstand Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00340.jpg] Figure 269: ‘Hello my friend, so glad to meet a great American ally "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00341.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00342.jpg]Figure 270: Private Bradley Manning before and after he was arrested by thecaring American government to experience its ‘values’ No, there has been not been a sudden conversion to decency and respect for the‘people’s rights’ so there must have been another reason for the Obama/Clintonchange of ‘heart’ over Mubarak, and it is clear what that is. The tone changedwith regard to Egypt and the Middle East, because we are seeing a whole newstage in the Illuminati global agenda (Fig 271[../Text/index_split_137.html#filepos1027649]). Official documents made publicby WikiLeaks reveal that the American government had been planning the‘spontaneous’ protests via its embassy in Cairo and had been working with keydemonstrators and activists for years. The ‘people’s revolution’ in Egypt wasjust another scene in the movie with the thousands of genuine protestors actingas unpaid, but essential, ‘extras’, while the ‘stars’ and scriptwriters did notappear on screen (Fig 272 [../Text/index_split_138.html#filepos1028166]). EvenObama and Clinton were only reading someone else’s words to sell the movie anddupe the extras and the audience. The real work was going on behind the scenesand involved the Rothschild Zionist-owned Google and Facebook, among otherInternet sources. The man credited with generating mass protest via the Internetwas Wael Ghonim, a marketing manager of Google Inc. Google Chief Executive andBilderberger, Eric Schmidt (Rothschild Zionist), said that what Ghonim didshowed how the ‘social media’ will be used by the masses in the future. Or, asHenry Kissinger (Rothschild Zionist) said during the Egyptian protests: ‘This isonly the first scene of the first act of a drama that is to be played out …’ Anyform of communication can be used for good or ill, but if the population is notstreetwise about how the game is played, and what the goals are, they can beTwittered into tyranny. The same techniques are being used to target Iran – thebig prize for the Rothschild network. The upheavals and wars in the Middle Eastare part of the strategy to control what Brzezinski calls Eurasia, and totrigger World War III. Eurasia is basically the land mass from Europe across toRussia and China and down into the Middle East, and the plan is to control asmany countries as possible that border Russia and China. Brzezinski wrote in his1997 book, The Grand Chessboard:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00343.jpg] Figure 271: The multi-headed monster is on a killing spree to take over theworld Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00344.jpg] Figure 272: Cue camera – action!

Protestsin Egypt followed those in Tunisia, which removed the incumbent leader. Therewere sporadic outbreaks of protest around the same time in Algeria and Libyabefore those in Libya were engineered to escalate. The bloodlines used this asan excuse to send the boys in to ‘protect peaceful protest’ by bombing Libyancities full of civilians. If you look to the right of Egypt you can see theother countries that the Rothschild mass killers have set out to destabilisewith a view to replacing their current leadership with their ‘new generation’ ofIlluminati stooges, as well as causing the mayhem that always suits their ends.From Egypt we go to Israel, the Rothschild fiefdom where the population is justcannon fodder for the goals of the Rothschild-owned leadership. Then we moveacross to the target countries of Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and thealready-occupied Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama’s claim that he was pulling troopsout of Iraq is another lie – at least 15,000 will stay behind under the guise of‘security officers’, ‘military instructors’ and, hilariously, ‘diplomats’. Inbetween Iraq and Afghanistan is the vast land mass and strategic ‘Mr Big’ thatis Iran. Anyone still wonder why Iran is being constantly demonised? The last Iheard the American government was saying that Iran was involved in ‘secretdeals’ with ‘Al-Qaeda’. Yawn. One of the most vehement proponents of bombingstrikes on Iran is a very sick man called John Bolton (Rothschild Zionist), afront-line neocon from the Project for the New American Century and former BushAmbassador to the United Nations. If it moves, or even if it doesn’t, Boltonwants to bomb it. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he had beencalling for military strikes against Iran for three years to stop an allegednuclear weapons programme. Israel has a nuclear weapons programme and, togetherwith the United States and Britain, has been involved in war after war. When wasthe last time Iran ever attacked anyone? Bolton never ever mentions Israel’smassive nuclear capability; he is just another Rockefeller/Rothschildstreetwalker. And have you noticed that America goes on and on about the dangersof other countries having nuclear weapons, but which is the only country so farto have used them to kill untold numbers of people in Japan? Exactly. Boltonacknowledged that an attack on Iran was likely to ignite regional war involvingIsrael, but he said that the cost was worth it. Reminds me of the infamousstatement by ‘shapeshifter’ Madeleine Albright (Rothschild Zionist), Secretaryof State in the Bill Clinton regime, who said that the deaths of half a millionchildren in Iraq as a result of sanctions was ‘worth it’.These people are literally, not just metaphorically, insane. They sip coffee inWashington while civilians and troops die in wars they have instigated. But it’sworth it, right? Could I have more cream, please? Foreign Affairs Committeechairwoman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, said after Bolton had argued for yet anothercountry to be bombed: ‘I love John Bolton.’ How about the civilians and childrenof Iran? Love them? Bolton was the Undersecretary of State in the Bushadministration who proposed in May 2002 to break up Libya and Syria, which isnow being attempted nine years later. Israel announced in August 2011 that itwas locating unmanned drone aircraft in the autonomous Kurdistan region ofnorthern Iraq, not far from the border with Iran. Massoud Barzani, President ofthe Kurdistan Regional Government, reportedly agreed to this in return for theadmission of a number of Iraqi Kurd students to Israeli universities. What ajoke! Do you want to stay alive, Massoud? ‘Yes, sir’. Then we’re coming in,right? ‘Of course, sir, you are most welcome, I’ll make some tea.’ IsraeliMossad agents and military advisers will also be stationed with the drones aspart of the ‘deal’, and quite blatantly Iran is the target. Dmitry Rogozin, theRussian envoy to NATO, said in August 2011 that NATO was preparing for amilitary strike on Iran to overthrow the government. He told the Russian dailynewspaper Izvestia that NATO intended to change governments whose views did notcoincide with those of the ‘West’ (the Rothschilds and the bloodline families).‘The noose around Iran is tightening,’ he said. ‘Military planning against Iranis underway and we are certainly concerned about an escalation of a large-scalewar in this huge region.’ He believed that attacks on Syria and Yemen could bethe prelude to a strike against Iran. This came amid speculation that Israelwould attack Iran’s nuclear facilities to divert attention from Palestinianefforts to join the United Nations.To the right of Iran and Afghanistan on the map we reach Pakistan, which isbeing systematically destabilised and bombed by US unmanned drone aircraft onthe pretext of ‘fighting terrorism’. The pressure for an all-out invasion hasincreased in the wake of the Bin-Laden-shooting-that-never-happened. Theillusion that it did happen has been used to target Pakistan for ‘harbouringterrorists’. Our journey across the wish-list takes us to the borders of Chinaand India, and I have long said that a Third World War is planned at some pointinvolving China, Russia, Europe and North America with the trigger coming out ofthe Middle East through conflict involving Israel and Muslim states that willdraw in the major powers. John ‘Bloodlust’ Bolton knows this, and this is why hesaid that although an attack on Iran was likely to create a wider regional warinvolving Israel and other Arab states, the price was worth it. The price is notonly ‘worth it’ – the bloodline agenda demands it. I write this in June 2011,and we have already reached the point where China is telling the ‘West’ that ifit messes with Pakistan, it messes with China. Chen Bingde, chief of the GeneralStaff of the People’s ‘Liberation’Army, has welcomed an increase in Chinesemilitary cooperation with Moscow and a joint build-up of forces. Russia is alsoincreasing its condemnation of the NATO bombing of Libya. But it’s all a game.Russia and China could have voted against a resolution at the UN SecurityCouncil that would have blocked the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya; butthey didn’t. They abstained and allowed the resolution to pass (Fig 274[../Text/index_split_140.html#filepos1041629]). The plan to target all the Arabcountries in North Africa and the Middle East is what Kissinger really meantwhen he said that what happened in Egypt was ‘only the first scene of the firstact of a drama that is to be played out …’ I wrote when the Egyptian protestswere first underway that Syria, Jordan and others would follow, and this isalready happening in Syria with demands for an invasion of the country to‘protect peaceful protestors’. The truth is that far from all of the protestorsin Syria have been peaceful. Agents provocateurs and mercenaries, well-armed andwell organised by the US and Israel, and supplied with weapons via Turkey, beganto kill Syrian soldiers (and civilians) with heavy machine guns. When troopsfired back and gunmen and more civilians were killed, Obama and Clinton werespitting with condemnation. Press TV reported that scores of heavily-armed‘protestors’ with hi-tech weapons and ammunition were arrested in the southerncity of Daraa near the border with Jordan. The US State Department said in April2011 that the government had spent $50 million in the previous two years ‘todevelop new technologies to help activists protect themselves from arrest andprosecution by authoritarian governments’. All of that should have been spent inAmerica, then. The State Department admitted that training had been organisedfor 5,000 ‘activists’ worldwide, and this included a gathering in the MiddleEast involving ‘activists’ in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon who returned totheir countries with the role of training others. The Washington Post publishedcables that revealed how America has been funding opposition groups in Syriasince 2005 when Syria was added to the neocon ‘Axis of Evil’. The samebackground applies to Libya. The Libyan ‘rebels’ were exposed in film footagefor having sophisticated weapons straight out of the box. They also committedgrotesque atrocities against Gaddafi supporters in the territories that theyheld and took over; but that doesn’t count. They are the ‘goodies’. Obama hadthe nerve to claim that bombing universities, hospitals and other civiliantargets in Tripoli, killing civilians by the thousands, did not represent‘hostilities’ as he tried to justify his refusal to comply with the War PowersAct. The man is a psychiatrist’s life’s work. I have said a number of timesalready that the bloodlines do not take no for an answer. They wanted ColonelGaddafi overthrown and preferably dead and they planned to increase thebombardment of Libya until they got their way. The same is planned for Syria,Jordan and Lebanon. NATO activities in Turkey, from where they can easily strikeSyria and Jordan, and a US naval build-up in the Mediterranean, confirm that acoordinated and long-planned script is being played out. The US Navy’s newestand most sophisticated aircraft carrier, named after the paedophile and serialkiller, George H W Bush, has been deployed to the region as I write, and it hasnot gone there to hand out candy. Obama announced at the same time that therewould be a phased withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan (to free them to fightelsewhere)."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00346.jpg] Figure 274: What appear to be random events are carefully engineered andcoordinated Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) THE REAL AXIS OF EVILAmerican, British and Israeli military Intelligence specialise in covertlyinfiltrating countries to cause mayhem in preparation for takeover. They havebeen doing this all over the world, decade after decade. Barack Obama spoke fromthe depths of hypocrisy when he tried to use the excuse of ‘diplomatic immunity’to free a professional American terrorist working for US Intelligence inPakistan who was arrested after shooting dead two Pakistanis. Raymond Davis shotthe men when they pulled their motorcycle alongside the car that he was drivingin Lahore in January 2011. He says that they were armed and he acted inself-defence, but he fired ten shots and then got out of his car to shoot one ofthe men twice in the back as he ran away. Some reports say that the dead weremembers of Pakistani Intelligence who were on to Davis. A group of unidentifiedAmericans in another car tried to rescue Davis as a crowd gathered, and they ranover and killed a third Pakistani before the crowd intervened and ensured Daviswas arrested. Obama responded, as usual, with an outrageous lie by calling Davis‘our diplomat in Pakistan’ and claiming that he was immune from prosecution inPakistan. It subsequently emerged that Davis is a CIA agent – hence the guns,maps, make-up kit, telescopes and long-range radio found in his car. Otherreports made a connection to Xe, the notorious ‘private security’ firm formerlyknown as ‘Blackwater’. This operates as a private army of mercenaries for theUnited States government … the same United States that condemned the alleged useof mercenaries by Colonel Gaddafi. ‘Mercenaries and thugs have been turned looseto attack demonstrators,’ Hillary Clinton shrieked. The mysterious Americans whotried to rescue Raymond Davis, a 36-year-old former Special Forces soldier, werealso CIA. Pakistani officials say that they were armed and lived at the samehouse as Davis. The government of the ‘Land of the Free’, which claims topromote a free media across the world, pressured its own ‘free’ ‘journalists’ tosuppress the story that Davis was a CIA operative. The lapdog media dutifullyagreed until overseas newspapers ran the story and made further suppression inAmerica a farce. London’s Daily Telegraph reported that Davis was the actinghead of the CIA station in Pakistan and was gathering information for droneattacks. A camera in his car included pictures of sensitive locations. Davis wasfreed after the families of the two dead men were paid a reported $2.34 million– ‘blood money’ as it is known in Pakistan. Sharia law allows relatives of amurder victim to pardon the killer, and here they were being handsomely paid todo so. If you ever see Raymond Davis in your country, it’s probably time toleave. Britain and Israel are constantly doing the same. Two British SAS SpecialForces soldiers were arrested by Iraqi police in 2005 after failing to stop at aroadblock in Basra (Fig 275 [../Text/index_split_141.html#filepos1047372]). Theywere dressed as Arabs and wearing wigs. The men opened fire, killing one Iraqipoliceman and wounding another, before they were captured. These British elitesoldiers, in their Arab disguise, had weapons, explosives and a remote-controldetonator in their vehicle. The car was booby-trapped and ready to explode. Itwas clear that the intention was to set up a manufactured ‘terrorist attack’ tobe blamed on ‘insurgents’. ‘False flag’ terror attacks have happened so manytimes in Israel over the years with attacks against Jews orchestrated by Mossadand then blamed on ‘Arab terrorists’. British authorities were so desperate tospring their men before the full truth could come out that they used tanks tostorm the Iraqi police station where they were being held. They ‘rescued’ thetwo agent provocateur terrorists and took away their vehicle. British, Americanand Israeli military Intelligence is nothing less than a global terroristnetwork that hides behind fake morality and ‘what, who, me?’ ‘Oh no, we wouldnever do that, we’re the good guys – it’s the baddies you want.’ This does notmean that the governments of countries like Syria have no responsibility at all.They do. But it’s not black and white. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria hasbeen the most popular leader in the Middle East and he has been receivingtremendous support from most of the population during the engineered protests;but this has not been covered by the mainstream media – the same with enormouscrowds in Tripoli in support of Gaddafi. They instead broadcast footage of armedagents-provocateurs shooting into crowds as if they were government troops. Oneplan is to have sanctions imposed on Syria to bring the country to its knees andencourage the people to remove President Assad."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00347.jpg] Figure 275: Fake Arabs on a grotesque mission for the grotesque Britishgovernment with all its ‘values’ THE SICKO ‘SHEIKHS’ OF ARABIAThe ‘royal’ families of Arabia are in fact not ‘royal’ at all. They just made itup and said, ‘We’re in charge.’ The term ‘Sheikh’, for example, is commonly usedwith ‘royal’ connotations, but there is nothing ‘royal’ or ‘genetic’ about theterm ‘Sheikh’. It simply means ‘wise man’, an elder of a tribe or an Islamicscholar, or literally ‘a man of old age’. The definition says nothing aboutbeing a violent suppressor of the people so that you can steal their country’soil resources; or about living the high life in the capital cities of the worldwhile demanding – under threat of jail, flogging, stoning or death – that yourpeople at home live according to strict rules of ‘morality’. These MiddleEastern dictators have no ‘morals’. If they did, they couldn’t do what they do.None of the Arab ‘royal’ dictatorships are safe from the manipulation of genuineanger by oppressed and poverty-stricken peoples to change regimes that suit thebloodline game-plan. The ‘royal-oil’ dynasties and others must be cancelling thelaxative orders. Some will be safer than others depending on what best servesthe agenda of the Illuminati and its client state, America; but they’re all indanger now. I lived in Saudi Arabia for two months as a young guy in themid-1970s as part of a group coaching and developing footballers. I should havebeen there for at least two years, but I couldn’t stand the place and I was outwithin eight weeks. I saw the opulence of the ‘royal’ palaces and lifestylecompared with the poverty of the people – a vast inequality underpinned bytyrannical laws and horrific punishments, including beheading, imposed by theirextreme version of ‘Islam’ known as ‘Wahhabism’. The death penalty is imposedfor murder, adultery, rape, sexual misconduct, rejecting Islam, armed robbery,theft, blasphemy, homosexuality, drug smuggling, sedition, prostitution,witchcraft and idolatry. Other punishments include flogging, chopping off handsand feet for robbery, and the public stoning of women. One woman was sentencedto 200 lashes and six months in jail for being gang-raped. Somehow, it was herfault. No wonder the Bush family and the US and British establishment in generalhave seen them as ‘friends and allies’. The disgusting ‘British Empire’ was thekey force behind the imposition of Saudi Arabia’s first king, Ibn Saud, who wason the British payroll, and the House of Saud’s evil and insane Wahhabi creed.The treatment of women is extraordinary. They are forced to cover themselvesalmost completely in public; they make up only five per cent of the workforce;and it is against the law for them even to drive. In the two months I was thereI hardly saw a woman’s face – only their eyes peeping through a veil, thedarkest of black (Saturn). Arriving in Saudi Arabia was like landing on anotherplanet, and nowhere in the world is more overdue a change of ‘leadership’ thanSaudi Arabia and its truly grotesque ‘House of Saud’."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00348.jpg] Figure 276: Bahrain despot, Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa – Salman binKilling bin Torturing, for short The hypocrisy is shocking, with Saudi support for the Arab League’s (RothschildLeague’s) call for a no-fly zone over Libya to ‘protect the protestors’ fromgovernment attacks while, at the same time, the Saudi army was being orderedinto Bahrain to kill civilians and suppress peaceful protest supported by theUnited Arab Emirates (UAE). They moved in only days after US Defense Secretary,Robert Gates, met with Bahrain’s Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad bin IsaAl-Khalifa, who represents a dynasty that has ruled for more than 200 years (Fig276). Witnesses reported that 100,000 mercenaries hired by Al-Khalifa were usingposts, knives, clubs, swords and hatchets to attack protestors at random, andthat nerve gas and neurotoxins have killed and paralysed numerous people – afact confirmed by nine doctors. One of them filed a report with Human RightsWatch verifying this. Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,denounced the commandeering of the country’s hospitals by the Bahrainigovernment while protestors were being killed and injured by that samegovernment. ‘This is shocking and illegal conduct,’ she said. These are the sameludicrous and appalling Bahraini and Saudi Arabian ‘royals’ that withdrew theirambassadors to Syria in protest at the government’s treatment of protestors(many of whom were armed agents provocateurs). The Bahrain ‘royal’ Nazis evenbrought dozens of medical professionals before a military court for the ‘crime’of giving treatment to injured anti-government demonstrators. Some were alsocharged with lying and exaggerating on TV satellite channels with the aim oftarnishing the international image of the country (impossible, surely). Thedoctors said they were being tortured in custody and confessions forced out ofthem – just like at Guantanamo Bay. But the reaction from the ‘no-flyers’ with‘values’ who sent the bombers into Libya? Silence. And no wonder. The US FifthFleet is based in Bahrain. The tiny country is a significant banking centre, andthere were other fish to literally ‘fry’ for the moment. Weapons used to killand suppress peaceful protesters in Bahrain came courtesy of United Statescompanies. Bahrain spent $200 million with American arms’ suppliers in the yearto October 2010. Obama invited the British and American educated Al-Khalifa tothe White House while the killing continued, and voiced his ‘strong support forthe crown prince’s ongoing efforts to initiate the ‘national dialogue’. Theslaughter of the innocent notwithstanding. Secretary of State Hillary Clintonpraised Al-Khalifa’s efforts to deal with the revolution. ‘Bahrain is a partnerand a very important one to the United States and we are supportive of theirnational dialogue and the kinds of important work that the crown prince has beendoing in his nation, and we look forward to it,’ she said. Hey, Mr Sheikh man, Idon’t want to worry you, darling, but she said Mubarak was a family friendbefore suddenly demanding that he had to go. These mendacious hypocrites bombLibya with the excuse of protecting peaceful protestors while describing themurder and violence inflicted on protestors in Bahrain as ‘ongoing efforts toinitiate the national dialogue’. They have no shame. British Prime MinisterDavid Cameron (Tony Blair, Mark II) took the same line on Bahrain when theviolence was compared with what was happening in Libya. Cameron said that thetwo situations were not the same; but course they are. In fact, it is worse inBahrain because two other countries crossed the border to suppress anothernation’s people. What he really means by ‘not the same’ is that they wanted toremove Gaddafi as soon as possible, but for now they need the fake royals ofBahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to stay where they are. Theywant all the Muslim countries eventually, especially the ‘big prizes’ of Iranand Saudi Arabia, but they have to do it carefully and systematically or itcould all go pear-shaped. The idea is to pick off other countries in the regionbefore turning their attention to the ones they need on their side for now. Theintervention in Bahrain was a desperate response by both Saudi Arabia and theUAE motivated by the fear that if the fraudulent ‘royals’ of Bahrain were tofall, it could be them next. The UAE’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Anwar MohammedGargash, said the decision to support the Bahrain dictatorship reflects thedetermination of the Gulf states to ‘close ranks in the face of any danger’ (totheir continuing tyranny). But the Saudi and UAE dictators are only putting offthe moment when they will be gone, too, one way or another. They are just pawnsin a game that they don’t understand. They are here today and gone tomorrow whenit is more useful to the agenda for them to go rather than stay.WHAT A LOAD OF SHI-ITEThere is another reason that the bloodlines want Saudi Arabia and other Gulfregimes in situ – for the moment. The two factions of Islam, Sunni and Shia, arebeing played off against each other to divide and conquer the Arab world. Thisschism within Islam stems from a disagreement about the line of succession fromthe Prophet Mohammed that goes back to the 7th century when the Sunni andShi’ite factions went their separate ways while agreeing on the divine nature ofthe Koran and Islam in general. I know, but pinch yourself and you’ll see it istrue. This ancient division has been used in modern times in an attempt to keepthe Muslim population divided and ruled, and so many are still falling for ittoday. There are countries where the two factions get along fine, but in othersthey loathe each other, and the extremists of the Sunni Wahhabi creed in SaudiArabia say that if a Sunni kills a Shi’ite it improves their chances of gettingto heaven. One of the roles of the Saudi ‘royal family’ (joke) on behalf of thebloodlines is to maintain the hatred between Sunni and Shi’ites. Most of theMiddle East is dominated by Sunni Muslims, but the country where the Shi’itesare most dominant is Iran (90 per cent Shia). The bloodlines want to secure thisland more than any other in the region. Protests in Bahrain are mainly by theShia majority (70 per cent of the population) challenging the Sunni dictatorshipof the ruling ‘royal family’. The Sunni fiefdom of Saudi Arabia (95 per centSunni) and the United Arab Emirates (80 per cent Sunni) has moved in toviolently suppress the mainly Shi’ite protests. The House of Saud is especiallyjumpy because while there is a massive Sunni domination in Saudi Arabia, theShi’ites are the majority in the eastern region where most of the oilfields are.Protestors in Bahrain have said that what they are doing is not about Shia orSunni; it is about freedom, justice and the end of dictatorship. But it suitsthe tyrants of the Middle East to present it this way, and that also suitsRothschild Israel which has worked tirelessly to maintain the Arab world in astate of ongoing division wherever possible. The Western Illuminati networkswant to use the Sunni dictators (many of whom are Sunni, even Muslim, in nameonly) to support efforts to overthrow the Shia leadership in Iran (another bunchof religious dictators). The irony is that Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, and all the rest, are on the list for ‘Western’conquest when the timescale suits. In the summer of 2011, the US is alreadydrone-bombing Yemen – which is right across the border from Saudi Arabia. Thesecold, callous and merciless Arab leaders will be used and supported until thattime comes and then they will be told ‘taxi waiting for Mr Sheikh’ – just asthey did with Mubarak in Egypt. They are only ‘rulers’ of convenience for nowand that is all they ever were. The gathering rage of people who have sufferedunder their suppression generation after abused generation will not be crushedforever, either. They might be put down here and there for a time by sheermilitary force and brutality, but they are not going away. Indeed, that rage isbeing fuelled by the murderous response in places like Bahrain and Yemen. Theseare the dying days of the ‘royal’ dictators of the Middle East. It is not a caseof if they go – only when. Good riddance. But what replaces them is thequestion.THE JET FUEL OF TYRANNY – HYPOCRISYThe wonder is that they don’t choke on the words they speak, but then they aresuch seasoned liars I guess that the choking would come if they ever told thetruth. I watched for weeks as the public was prepared for the invasion of Libya.The ‘no-fly zone’ and ‘protecting civilians’ was an excuse to begin the bombingcampaign, but it was really an invasion via the ‘rebels’ from day one. The goalfrom the start was to remove Colonel Gaddafi from power and they planned tochange the rules of engagement as necessary to achieve that. US Admiral SamuelLocklear, commander of the NATO Joint Operations Command in Naples, Italy, saidprivately that NATO forces were actively trying to kill Gaddafi, while the Obamaadministration said that ‘regime change’ was not their intention and was notauthorised by the UN mandate. No, it wasn’t, but that had never been a problembefore and neither was it with Libya. NATO bombed hospitals, food storagecentres, water distribution infrastructure, endless other civilian locations andalso television towers to force broadcasters off-air. You can be sure every timethey open their mendacious mouths that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, DavidCameron, Tony Blair, Nicolas Sarkozy and neocons such as John Bolton are eitherpromoting the bloodline agenda or lying to keep it secret. Mike Turner, a memberof the House Armed Services Committee, said that Admiral Locklear told him thatprotecting civilians was being interpreted to permit the removal of the chain ofcommand of Gaddafi’s military, which included Gaddafi himself. It was aninvasion by foreign powers to remove the Libyan leader, put their own regime inpower and take over Libya’s banking system and vast oil reserves. They wantedGaddafi gone for many reasons, including his plan to introduce an Africancurrency based on gold, which he knows many Western countries, especiallyAmerica, don’t have in large quantities for the reasons that I outlined earlier.Fort Knox is full of tungsten fakes. Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez, a friendof Gaddafi, ordered the return of his country’s entire gold reserves from aroundthe world in 2011 – much of it held in London – and you can be sure that thiswas, at least in part, connected to the same story. Gaddafi was also in someways what is called ‘the threat of a good example’. The bloodlines set out tocrush any leader or government that shows that there are other ways of doingthings. They fear that this could start a domino effect once people are shown anexample of something different that works. Colonel Gaddafi was in power for some40 years without El-ections – and I am not supporting or advocating that in theleast. But let us have some balance here. Nelson Mandela described Gaddafi as‘one of the 20th century’s greatest freedom fighters’. Gaddafi took over one ofthe poorest countries in the world and used the oil revenues to give the Libyanpeople the highest standard of living in Africa. Everybody had money put intotheir bank accounts from the oil income; everybody had free healthcare, and ifan operation was not available in Libya, patients were flown overseas fortreatment; after the Gaddafi revolution, basic foods were subsidised; and newfarmers were given free use of land, a home, livestock and feed. Will any ofthis happen under the new NATO/Rothschild regime? Not a chance. Gaddafi turnedthe coastal desert area green with an irrigation scheme called one of thewonders of the modern world, while using oil money to provide electricity anddevelop the country. He also encouraged women to be educated and to havecareers, despite hostile opposition from Islamic extremists (especially in the‘rebel’ stronghold of Benghazi). Showing the rest of the world what can be doneis precisely what the bloodlines don’t want to happen. The fake oil-royals ofthe Middle East don’t want this either when it contrasts so blatantly with theirhijacking of oil revenues for their own gluttonous aggrandisement. No wonderSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined the ‘coalition’ to attackLibya. The mainstream media played its usual role in demonising someone thebloodlines wish to target, and we heard ludicrous stories about Gaddafi handingout Viagra to soldiers so they would rape women when they seized ‘rebel’-heldareas. This needs to go in the same trash-can marked ‘intelligence-insultingpropaganda’, along with Saddam Hussein’s troops throwing babies out ofincubators; German armies of the First World War riding around with babiesskewered on their lances; and prisoners of the Nazi concentration camps beingmade into soap. American investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, who went toTripoli to see for himself what was happening, said: ‘We haven’t seen aninformation war like this, a propaganda war, since leading up to the war on Iraqand the occupation, you know, the yellowcake uranium, the biological mobileweapons labs …’ Human rights’ organisations failed to find any evidence for therape claims – and why would they when the sources were paid-for ‘rebels’ inLibya? Liar-for-a-living, Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, was spoutingthis crap. John ‘Bloodlust’ Bolton, one of her predecessors, would have beendrooling with pride. Not a word that ushers from the lips of any Americanambassador to the United Nations is to be believed. Only genetic liars needapply. Human Rights Watch reported that Libyan ‘rebels’ were looting shops andclinics and setting fire to homes of suspected Gaddafi supporters, but HillaryClinton was only ‘concerned’ with the calculated nonsense that Gaddafi’s troopswere engaging in mass rape. Well, she at least has lots of experience on thatsubject and so does her husband, Bill. Slaves from US government mind-controlprogrammes are their speciality (see Cathy O’Brien’s book, Trance-Formation ofAmerica). I watched as a succession of sanctimonious hypocrites and supporters –even orchestrators – of mass murder and human carnage stepped forward to themicrophone to condemn Gaddafi and other Middle East dictators for allegedviolence against peaceful protesters (but not Saudi Arabia or Bahrain). Themainstream media never calls them out on any of their obvious contradiction anddeceit. This is how professional liars, called political leaders, get away withit. Other professional liars – called ‘journalists’ – keep schtum. Take HillaryClinton – yes, please do – the cold and vicious US Secretary of State whosupported the slaughter of the innocent in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere whiledemanding that the Middle Eastern dictators stop using violence against theirpeople. I suppose she thinks that’s her job. Cue Hillary at the United NationsHuman Rights Council on February 28th, 2011 to lie through her teeth to demonisethe next bloodline target: > Today the world’s eyes are fixed on Libya.

The British, American and Israeli establishment (collectively ‘the Rothschilds’)have a long, long history of doing unto others what they condemn the others fordoing. Lest we forget, the British, American and Israeli governments, in leaguewith a few minor players, concocted the non-existent ‘evidence’ of Iraq’sweapons of mass destruction to justify the bombing and devastation of an entirenation and priceless artefacts from its ancient culture. Millions of Iraqicivilians have been maimed and killed and had their lives destroyed by losingloved ones to the brave men in uniform who surrender their souls andself-identity to serve the global killing machine. Oops, sorry, ‘to serve theircountry’. American troops have told how they are encouraged to carry ‘dropweapons’ which they can place with dead civilians to make out they were‘insurgents’. How many times are we told on the news that troops have ‘killedinsurgents’ when they are innocent civilians? You can hear what the soldiers sayif you type these words into YouTube: ‘Drop weapons – US soldiers recountkilling innocent Iraqi civilians’. The same has happened – is happening – inAfghanistan where month after month civilians are caught in the crossfire ordirectly bombed by the British and American military. They are dismissed as‘collateral damage’ in yet another war sold to the world by the lies that Muslimterrorists were responsible for 9/11 when the real perpetrators wear businesssuits and uniforms in Washington, London and Tel Aviv (Fig 277[../Text/index_split_143.html#filepos1072353]). Civilians are suffering dailydeath and destruction from unmanned drones guided by lunatics at the joystickofficially sanctioned by lunatics at the Teleprompter. The drones are piloted byjoystick operatives at Creech Air Force Base near Las Vegas thousands of milesaway from the civilians they are now killing every day in Afghanistan, Pakistan,Yemen, Somalia – the list seems to get longer by the month. The British areinvolved with this, too, and RAF commanders say they are ‘comfortable legallywith what we are doing’. How about morally? Silence. American author JamesBamford, who has written extensively about US Intelligence, says the drones areindiscriminately killing many innocent people, including children. The NewAmerica Foundation said that one in four people killed by US drones since 2004has been an innocent civilian, and the Brookings Institute put the ratio evenhigher. James Bamford said:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00349.jpg] Figure 277: The consequences of being on the wish list of nations with ‘values’.This is Palestine, but the same goes for country after country > Death warrants for targets are signed by mid-level bureaucrats, and soccer> moms and dads double as joystick killers.

This robot army is being established so that when the people wake up insufficient numbers to cause problems for the Agenda, they can be attacked fromthe safety of bases inside mountains and underground. Hillary Clinton, who knowsall this, spoke at the UN Human Rights Council about ‘an important first steptoward accountability’ with the establishment of an independent (no such thing)UN Human Rights Commission inquiry into the violence against protestors inLibya; and Colonel Gaddafi faced an investigation into alleged war crimes by theInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands. This was createdin 2002 by the ‘Rome Statute’ to ‘bring to justice the perpetrators of the worstcrimes known to humankind – war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide’(clearly with exemptions for the governments of North America, Europe, Israel,Russia, China, Australia, etc.). America won’t even join the ICC while demandingthat it persecutes others. The Court’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo,said that ‘nobody has the power to massacre civilians without consequences’. Oh,but they do, Luis, old son. They do – and you refuse to investigate them, letalone prosecute. The bloodline-created and controlled ICC issued warrants inJune 2011 for Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam and Intelligence chief, Abdullahal-Sanussi on the basis of the story peddled by war criminals Barack Obama,Hillary Clinton, David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy. The warrants were welcomedby NATO Secretary-General, the Bilderberger, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, America,Britain and France as they continued to bomb civilian areas of Libya with thedeath toll constantly rising and numbering thousands (Fig 278[../Text/index_split_144.html#filepos1077410]). These mass-killers with ‘values’have also been using depleted uranium weapons that have caused such extremegenetic defects in Iraq and elsewhere. What will the ICC do about them? The bigzero. Where is the ICC investigation into the shocking scale of war crimes, andcrimes against humanity by ‘shapeshifter’ George Bush and ‘shapeshifter’ TonyBlair? Their casualty count can be numbered in millions and all based on coldand calculated lies. Where is the investigation into Cheney, Powell, Rice, andthe lie-factory known as Alistair Campbell, the Blair ‘spinner’ (professionalliar) who helped to produce fake ‘evidence’ to sell the war in Iraq at suchenormous human cost? Why has British Intelligence operative John Scarlett notbeen arrested for fabricating the ‘Intelligence dossier’ that made the case forwar in Iraq that cost so many lives? Scarlett was head of the Joint IntelligenceCommittee and sent a memo to Blair’s foreign affairs adviser referring to ‘thebenefit of obscuring the fact that in terms of WMD Iraq is not thatexceptional’. Blair rewarded him for services rendered by making him head ofMI6. Where is the arrest of Israeli leaders for the daily crimes against thePalestinians and the mass bombing of Gaza, the most densely populated civilianarea in the world? Where is the inquiry into the war crimes over decades ofRothschild/Rockefeller gofer, Henry Kissinger, and the Father Bush/Dick Cheneymassacres and abominations in the Gulf War of 1991? Or the ‘sanctions’ imposedon Iraq by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair which, according to UN figures, cost thelives of half a million children in the 1990s – a ‘price’ that Secretary ofState Madeleine Albright (Rothschild Zionist) said was ‘worth it’. Where?Nowhere."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00350.jpg] Figure 278: More children protected by the countries with ‘values’ These hypocrites, bullies and mass killers control the courts and commissionswhich, if they were truly about justice, would be calling for the prison van andthrowing away the key. Hillary Clinton’s words somehow survive what must be thetortuous process of being delivered with monumental fake morality without the‘lady’ falling off the stage in hysterical laughter (Figs 279[../Text/index_split_145.html#filepos1081721]). There is no justice in thepolitical, industrial and military system. Injustice and hypocrisy is its verylifeblood. One minute Mubarak, the murderous dictator of Egypt, is a Clinton‘family friend’; the next she is condemning his violence against demonstrators,playing the Holy Mother and saying he ‘must go’. One minute she and her corruptcronies in government are supplying weapons and military aid to Middle Eastdictators like Mubarak to violently suppress their own people; and the next theyare Moses calling on their fellow mass-murdering tyrants to ‘set the peoplefree’. Clinton condemned the torture that she said was used by Colonel Gaddafiwhile representing a US political-industrial-military complex that sentprisoners to be tortured in places like Mubarak’s Egypt to overcome laws againsttorture in the United States. David Petraeus, Commander of the ‘InternationalSecurity Assistance [Invasion] Force’ in Afghanistan, says that torture isacceptable. Obama has made him Director of the CIA and President Fraud has noproblem at all with torture. His administration announced in June 2011 that 99investigations into the death of prisoners in US custody were to be closed down.Petraeus said that torture was necessary to ‘save lives’ and he was speakingwhile commanding a killing machine in Afghanistan that had murdered shockingnumbers of civilians. Hillary Clinton decried the Syrian forces for killingprotestors, but told Syrians protesting against Israel at the border fence to‘show restraint’ after 23 of them were shot dead by Israeli troops. She saidthat Israel has a ‘right to defend itself’, just as America has ‘a right todefend itself’ by killing untold numbers in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya andPakistan. The same applies to British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, anothermouth-for-sale to the bloodlines who know, as he knows, that they could destroyhim in a day. He said that government violence in Syria was ‘unacceptable andmust stop’, while receiving regular updates on the British planes and troopsbombing civilians in Libya and Afghanistan. Amid the protests and violence inSyria, and the clear manoeuvring to justify military intervention, theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that it was reporting Syriato the UN Security Council for having a covert nuclear programme. This is allcoordinated through the bloodline networks. Once more the IAEA never mentionsthe enormous nuclear weapons programme that has been going for decades justacross the border at the Dimona site in Israel even though it is controlled byone of the most trigger-happy, violent countries on Earth. The IAEA’s evidencefor this action against Syria was an alleged undeclared nuclear reactor. Theundeclared entire nuclear programme in Israel is never ‘reported’, and theUnited States even has an official policy of not asking about Israel’s nuclearcapability – the ‘don’t tell, don’t ask’ agreement – which Obama immediatelyagreed to continue when he took office. Well, of course he would. It’s all agame for public consumption only that we are seeing unfold in the form ofmoralistic platitudes from the world’s political prostitutes – Teleprompterpropaganda not even written by those who peddle the words."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00351.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00352.jpg]Figure 279: ‘We believe in freedom, peace and self-determination for all people…’ …. ‘Haaahhhhhhh … fooled yah – only kidding …’ AMERICAN DEATH CAMPSThere can be few greater examples of this scourge of hypocrisy than the Americandeath camps in Germany at the end of World War II. The best part of two millionGermans died in American camps from disease, exposure and starvationsystematically directed on the orders of Supreme Allied Commander and future USPresident, General Dwight David Eisenhower. Meanwhile, British and Americanauthorities were condemning the Nazi camps such as Auschwitz. How many aretaught in their history ‘lessons’ (programming) that Eisenhower made it clear inhis own correspondence that he hated Germans and that he set about killing asmany as possible whenever he had the chance. He ordered that German Prisoners ofWar were designated as ‘Disarmed Enemy Forces’, or DEF, – just as his successorswould designate Prisoners of War in Afghanistan and Iraq as ‘Enemy Combatants’.This allows in both cases for American authorities to bypass international lawson the treatment of prisoners. Germans targeted by Eisenhower were not subjectto the Geneva Convention, nor were they visited by the Swiss Red Cross that wassupposed to inspect the camps and the treatment of prisoners. In this way,Eisenhower, the American ‘war hero’, enforced the starvation, exposure anddisease that cost the lives of almost two million people. A Canadian reporter,Peter Worthington of the Ottawa Sun, obtained documentation of this cynical massmurder. He wrote in 1989: > … it is hard to escape the conclusion that Dwight Eisenhower was a war> criminal of epic proportions. His (DEF) policy killed more Germans in peace> than were killed in the European Theater. For years we have blamed the 1.7> million missing German POWs on the Russians.

Martin Brech, a retired Professor of Philosophy in New York, was 18 years oldwhen he was a guard and interpreter at an Eisenhower Death Camp along the RiverRhine at a place called Andernach. He said in 1990 that when he protested at thetreatment of German prisoners he was met with ‘hostility or indifference’: > … I threw our ample rations to them over the barbed wire. I was threatened,> making it clear that it was our deliberate policy not to adequately feed them.> When they caught me throwing C-Rations over the fence, they threatened me with> imprisonment.

There are no ‘goodies and baddies’ in this black-and-whitefantasy that is sold daily to the global public mind. When Clinton or Obamacondemn Mubarak or some other tyrant, it is a case of evil condemning evil. Theymay have a different face, different clothes or uniform, but the mentality isthe same. They are cold-blooded, calculating and heartless, and have that primeIlluminati bloodline trait … lack of empathy. This is the common theme thatbrings them all together no matter what they may claim to represent.GET GADDAFII said from the moment that resolution 1973 was passed at the UN SecurityCouncil in 2011 to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya that the idea was not to‘protect peaceful protestors’, but to remove Gaddafi and take over Libya’s oiland banking assets. The United States, Britain and France had deployed militarypersonnel in the period before the ‘public protests’ in the east of the countryto train and arm the instigators to justify an invasion –Problem–Reaction–Solution. I also said that if Gaddafi didn’t go easily theywould keep increasing the military operation until he did. This is what happenedwith the limits of military action supposedly imposed by resolution 1973blatantly and brazenly ignored as NATO bombed centres of population to clear theway for the NATO-directed ‘rebels’ on the ground (Fig 280[../Text/index_split_147.html#filepos1090007]). The United Nations wasestablished by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and is located on land in NewYork donated by the Rockefellers. You would, therefore, expect the UN to dowhatever its creators and masters demand – and so it does. UN Security CouncilResolution 1973 agreed a no-fly zone over Libya to ‘protect civilians’. Thisshould have been the limit to military activities, and any violation of thisshould have been jumped upon immediately by the UN. But no. Violations? TheUS-dominated NATO did anything it liked with no consequences whatsoever whilethe UN just sat on its pathetic little hands. NATO spokesman, James Appathurai(mouth-for-sale, no, make that soul), said in June 2011 with Gaddafi defiantlystill alive: ‘The UN Security Council should adopt a new resolution on Libya.Resolution 1973 does not envisage land operations. We need a new resolution.’I’ll translate: ‘We have not yet removed or killed the man that we said we arenot trying to remove or kill so we have to increase the military bombardmentuntil we have removed or killed the man that we said we are not trying to removeor kill.’ How does Appathurai sleep at night? Like a baby, probably. The UnitedStates is going through a financial meltdown with trillions of dollars in debtto be serviced. Britain, and most of the rest of Europe, is also in direstraits. Crippling austerity programmes are being imposed upon the populationswith the excuse that governments don’t have the money after bailing out thebanks. But when it comes to war, money is never an object; and so it was againwith Libya. The reason is simple. Giving people a decent standard of living isnot the bloodline goal; quite the opposite. Bombing the world into a globaltyranny is, and thus there is always money for doing that. Once more the man whois dark of eye and dark of soul stepped forward to slavishly repeat the words ofothers with his Teleprompter mind and justify the bombing of Libya. What he saidwas such a work of fiction, such a classic of its type, that it is worthy ofsome analysis for future reference.

The ‘people’s’ revolution in Egypt was planned and orchestrated through theAmerican Embassy in Cairo for years before with agents provocateurs employed totrigger the genuine rage and frustration of a people oppressed by a Mubarakregime, maintained in power for three decades by American government money andweaponry. The time had simply come to manipulate upheavals throughout the MiddleEast as part of a much bigger global plan that is designed to lead to World WarIII. When Obama pointed out that ‘Libya sits directly between Tunisia andEgypt’, the relevance was not freedom, but the plan to tear asunder a series ofcountries in a line across North Africa and the Middle East to Pakistan’s borderwith China. The American government ‘interests’ that Obama talks about aremerely the interests of the bloodlines and they have no ‘values’. Obama saidthat Gaddafi ‘murdered opponents at home and abroad, and terrorized innocentpeople around the world, including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents’.These words were spoken by a man who authorised the CIA to kill Americancitizens abroad if they are ‘suspected’ of links with terrorist groups; a manwho sanctions and supports attacks by unmanned drone aircraft in countries likeAfghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen which have killed thousands ofcivilians. > In the face of the world’s condemnation, Gaddafi chose to escalate his> attacks, launching a military campaign against the Libyan people.

Go get ‘em,Jaaaahn. John Wayne invariably appeared over the hill with a gun in his hand,while the American government prefers a Tomahawk missile. It was all baloney, ofcourse, and Obama’s speech was every bit as much a movie, an act, as anythingthat Wayne ever did. When some senators challenged Obama’s right to wage warwithout the permission of Congress under the War Powers Act, those RothschildZionist shills, Senators John McCain (Rothschild Zionist, selected as Republicanpresidential candidate with the intention of him losing to the ‘chosen’ Obama)and John Kerry (Rothschild Zionist, Skull and Bones Society, selected asDemocrat candidate with the intention of him losing to the ‘chosen’ Boy Bush)jumped into action. They proposed that legislation be passed to giveretrospective permission for the war in Libya. Then the Rothschild Zionistneocons appeared over the horizon in their short trousers and school caps firingtheir popguns in all directions. The thought of William Kristol in shorttrousers is just too much. In fact, William Kristol in anything is to be given avery wide berth. The Foreign Policy Initiative, the re-born Project for the NewAmerican Century, published a letter from Kristol and others demanding that thewar against Gaddafi be expanded as much as necessary to remove him – so long asthey themselves never have to get any closer to the action than their drinkingclub in downtown Washington.

I am saying that they are agents of the secret society thatI call Rothschild Zionism. As these sick and mendacious people were calling forthe bombardment of Libya to be expanded, the country was sufferingever-increasing death, destruction and suffering as hospitals, universities,television stations and other civilian targets were hit. The civilian death-tollwas rising by the day as NATO bombing intensified. Ports were blocked toobstruct the transportation of food and other essential supplies, fishermen wereprevented from going to sea and there were long queues for fuel. Amid all this,the pure evil that is Hillary Clinton had the nerve to say: > The bottom line is, whose side are you on? Are you on Gaddafi’s side, or are> you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international> coalition that has been created to support them? Clinton is a ‘Democrat’, which is, as we know, different from being a‘Republican’. This is what President Boy Bush said during the slaughter in Iraq: > Either you are with us, either you love freedom, and nations which embrace> freedom, or you’re with the enemy – there’s no in between. As Adolf Hitler said: ‘Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, andeventually they will believe it.’ Well, not everyone any longer.CUT THE CRAP, MATE, THIS IS THE REAL REASONNow let us have the truth behind the attack on the Libyan people under the guiseof protecting them. Needless to say that every word that Obama has said on thesubject is a lie. That’s his job. Libya had a state-owned central bank and,unlike the US Federal Reserve, it had no private shareholders. The Libyangovernment issued the currency, the Libyan Dinar, and any business the bankingcartel wanted to do with the country had to be done through the central bank.The bloodlines wanted to put an end to all of this and ensure that Libya andother target countries with their own monetary systems fall into the financialabyss of debilitating debt to the Rothschild global banking network. Thefrontmen for the attacks on Libya – President Obama, British Prime MinisterDavid Cameron, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy – are all the bankers’property and nothing more than bankers’ molls. The word ‘moll’ is defined as: ‘acompanion of a gunman or gangster, also a prostitute’, so you can see what aperfect description that is. The plan was to subjugate Libya in a mountain ofdebt (control) when Gaddafi was toppled. The European Bank for Reconstructionand Development (owned and funded by Europe and the US) offered massive sums tothe post-Mubarak military government in Egypt in return for ‘free-marketreforms’. For ‘reforms’, read austerity programmes and sale of assets to theinternational banks and corporations (international bank and corporationsingular, in truth). The Egyptian military government has further indebted thecountry with billions in strings-attached loans that the people will have to payback, but will never see; and Rothschild bagmen, the truly appalling John McCain(Rothschild Zionist) and John Kerry (Rothschild Zionist; Skull and BonesSociety) led a delegation of Rothschild corporations to Egypt to promote‘freedom and democracy’. These were the same on-the-street, on-the-gamepoliticians that proposed retrospective legality for the illegal war againstLibya. Their delegation included representatives of General Electric, Boeing,Coca-Cola, Bechtel, ExxonMobil, Marriott International, and Dow Chemicals –collectively known as ‘Parasites on the Road’. Now, wait for this … the leadersof the ‘rebels’ in Libya took time out from ‘fighting for freedom’ to, yes,announce that they were establishing a new central bank to replace the one ownedby the State and free from control by the international banking cartel (theRothschilds). Robert Wenzel, from the Economic Policy Journal, rightly concludedthat ‘this suggests we have a bit more than a rag tag bunch of rebels runningaround and that there are some pretty sophisticated influences’. He said thatthe uprising looked like ‘a major oil and money play, with the true disaffectedrebels being used as puppets and cover’. Erm, just a little bit.As I said earlier, one ‘rebel military leader’ General Khalifa Hifter lived for20 years in the Greater Washington area of Virginia, close to the headquartersof the CIA who paid his bills; and the whole ‘National Transitional Council’established to replace Gaddafi is a US/NATO front peopled by corrupt sleazebags. Susan Rice, the mendacious US representative to the United Nations, made arequest to the UN Sanctions Committee in August 2011 for permission to unfreeze$1.5 billion of assets owned by the Central Bank of Libya, Libyan InvestmentAuthority, Libyan Foreign Bank, Libya Africa Investment Portfolio and LibyaNational Oil Corporation. The US said that $500 million would go to its ‘aid’organisation USAID for ‘ongoing humanitarian needs and those that can beanticipated’, and another $500 million would be given to ‘companies supplyingfuel and vital humanitarian goods’ (the oil cartel and Illuminati corporationslike Halliburton). The third $500 million would be allocated to the ‘TemporaryFinancial Mechanism’ (TFM) for ‘salaries and operating expenses of Libyan civilservants, food subsidies, electricity and other humanitarian purchases’. Excuseme? What the hell is the ‘Temporary Financial Mechanism’? Did I miss something?It turned out to be an ‘informal’ organisation established by the United Statesgovernment (the Rothschilds) to administer Libya! This is the body that fundsthe National Transitional Council that we are told is the interim government ofLibya. The United States is doing in Libya what it has done in Iraq – taking theplace over lock, stock and oil barrel. The Libyan ‘revolution’? See Tunisia,Egypt, et al. Another country has been stolen before our eyes while many of itscitizens cheered – though vastly less than the media would have you believe, andeven fewer when reality dawns. The NATO fascists would not rest, of course,until Gaddafi was dead – their intention from the start. Another Libyan‘opposition group’, the ‘National Front of the Salvation of Libya’ (NFSL) isbased in the United States and has been bankrolled by the CIA since 1981. ACIA/Mossad-inspired NFSL attack on the Gaddafi compound in Tripoli on May 8th,1984, attempted to assassinate Gaddafi, and while he escaped 80 others werekilled. The organisation is part of a series of CIA–Mossad–British Intelligencefront groups that have been established over the decades of Gaddafi’s rule toremove him from power – culminating with the NATO bombardment. Their ‘umbrella’organisation has been the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition whichwas created in London in 2005. The National Front of the Salvation of Libyaplayed a major part in organising the Libyan ‘Day of Rage’ on February 17th,2011, and one of the anti-Gaddafi propagandists in the United States, theArizona-born ‘Libyan–American’ rapper, ‘Khaled M’, is the son of one of thefounders of the NFSL for his masters at the CIA, Mossad and BritishIntelligence. Needless to say, ‘Khaled M’ was given a great deal of publicity bythe mainstream US media along with the ‘February 17th’ website of the ‘LibyanYouth Movement’. Libya is another ‘people’s revolution’ that was triggered andguided by the Hidden Hand to secure even greater oppression under another name.One of the first NATO strikes on the Libyan capital, Tripoli, was against theLibyan anti-corruption agency to destroy the documents being used in chargesagainst government ministers for stealing oil revenues and transferring theminto Swiss bank accounts. Wayne Madsen, an investigative journalist, pointed outthat – almost to the person – these were the ministers who ‘defected’ to the‘rebel’ movement. Then there is the French ‘philosopher’, Bernard-Henri Lévy(Rothschild Zionist), the buddy of President Nicolas Sarkozy (RothschildZionist). Lévy made many visits to meet the ‘rebels’ in Libya and he seems toturn up at trouble spots all over the world to meet with major players inconflicts. He was in Southern Sudan and Darfur; Afghanistan and South West Asia;Bosnia; South Ossetia and then Libya. Lévy has encouraged an uprising in Iranand argued for military intervention in Syria. He is the bloodlines’ boypromoting the Rothschild Zionist agenda. This is a man who once said of thebrutal Israeli Defense Forces: ‘I have never seen such a democratic army, whichasks itself so many moral questions. There is something unusually vital aboutIsraeli democracy.’ Words have no meaning."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00355.jpg] Figure 282: The Emir of Qatar: The bloodlines’ buddy The bloodline-controlled, sorry, ‘rebel-controlled’, National TransitionalCouncil, claims to be the ‘sole legitimate representative of Libyan People’ andwas officially recognised, oh, so predictably, by the United States and morethan 30 other lapdog countries as the legitimate governing body in Libya. TheNational Transitional Council announced early in the conflict from itsstronghold in Benghazi that it had: ‘[Created] … the Central Bank of Benghazi asa monetary authority competent in monetary policies in Libya and [appointed] aGovernor to the Central Bank of Libya, with a temporary headquarters inBenghazi’. How multi-tasking of them to do this with all that fighting going on.But, wait, there’s more. They also created a new ‘Libyan Oil Company’ based inBenghazi to take control of Africa’s biggest known oil reserves, and they haveeven found time in what must have been their very busy schedule to sign an oildeal with Qatar. The Obama government and the United Nations both told the‘rebels’ that they could sell any oil under their control so long as it did notinvolve Gaddafi’s National Oil Corporation. Well, that was nice. What an openbook it all is. An image of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, wasplaced on a billboard close to the ‘rebel’ headquarters in Benghazi with thewords: ‘Qatar, history will always remember your support for our cause’ (Fig282). The Emir was instrumental in arranging Arab world support for the NATOairstrikes against Libya. Newspaper reports said that Britain and France wereusing Qatar to bankroll the rebels and to supply arms. Qatari officialsconfirmed that they were shipping weapons to Benghazi. Khaled Kayim, Libya’sthen deputy foreign minister, said that about 20 Qatari specialists were inBenghazi and this was at the same time that the Emir of Qatar was in Washingtonto meet Obama and get his orders from Obama’s controllers. Othman MohammedRishi, of the ‘rebel’ Ministry of Finance and Oil, said of Qatar: ‘They havegiven us fuel, credited us millions of dollars, and paid the bills for importswe could not afford. We are very grateful to them.’ Qatar is the home of theArabic television channel, Al Jazeera. This has the reputation of being on theside of ‘the people’ in the Middle East; but it is not. Al Jazeera wasestablished to broadcast pictures and information aimed at programming thereality of ‘the people’ as part of the long-term strategy of manipulating theMiddle East. The Al Jazeera network was launched with money from the Emir ofQatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa. This guy is a bloodline asset who attended theBritish Royal Military Academy Sandhurst – another programming operation whereforeign leaders and military chiefs are prepared for a lifetime of service tothe Rothschild networks. A 70-page plan for a post-Gaddafi Libya obtained byLondon’s The Times newspaper confirmed the tyranny that awaited the Libyanpeople when NATO prevailed. It included proposals for the imposition of a 10,000to 15,000 ‘Tripoli Task Force’ funded by the disgusting tyrants of the UnitedArab Emirates to take control of the Libyan capital and arrest Gaddafisupporters. The document also reveals plans to take over the Libyan media. Itwas all organised long before the engineered trouble started by the (NATO)‘rebels’.OPERATION AFRICAThe bloodlines are now making their play not only for the Middle East and NorthAfrica, but the entire African continent. This brings still more potential for aconflict with China (World War III), as China takes over large parts of Africa.All this was the reason for the creation in 2007 of AFRICOM, the US militaryAfrican command structure officially established by Boy Bush and his Secretaryof Defense, Robert Gates, who was, of course, kept on by ‘Mr Change’ Obama. Whyshould they complicate an ongoing agenda by changing the Defense Secretary justbecause they’ve changed the puppet in the White House? Gates was eventuallyreplaced in 2011 by CIA Director Leon Panetta, a man extremely sympathetic toIsrael from the time he shared a house with Rothschild Zionist extremist,Senator Charles Schumer. Panetta has confirmed America’s ‘unshakable commitmentto Israel’s security’ (aggression and genocide). AFRICOM is based at KelleyBarracks in Stuttgart, Germany, with other centres in Djibouti, the UnitedKingdom and Florida. It also has ‘Offices of Security Cooperation’ and ‘DefenseAttaché Offices’ in 36 African countries. AFRICOM is responsible for the wholeof Africa except for Egypt, which is the responsibility of USCENTCOM. Thearrogance of these people fencing off the world into US military regions, but,once again, this is not about America. The ‘COMS’ are planned to be transferredto a world army when America has been brought to its knees. The originaljustification for AFRICOM was to coordinate the ‘fight against terrorism’ inAfrican countries. This repeating excuse was made possible by the US–Israelengineered attacks of 9/11. The real reason for AFRICOM is the takeover ofAfrica and its major oil resources in Libya (47 billion barrels in knownreserves); Nigeria (37.5 billion); Angola (13.5 billion); Algeria (13.4billion); and Sudan (6.8 billion). We are witnessing the rape and pillage of anentire continent and the Arab world. The American military (the bloodlines’military) is seeking to establish bases throughout the continent in its plan toseize control of its people and resources. This is the truth behind what ishappening in Libya and across North Africa and the Middle East. Obama knows thatwhen his eyes scan the Teleprompter for lie after lie. He would not haveproclaimed a no-fly zone over Libya if he really wanted peace in the world andto protect innocent people from the jackboot of State violence. He would haveimposed one over the United States, Britain and Israel – the ‘Axis of Evil’. Theworld would then be a much safer place. We saw the conflict with China scenariobeing ratcheted up when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured Africancountries in 2011. She said that Africa must beware of a ‘new colonialism’ asChina expanded its presence. The audacity of this statement from a womanrepresenting an administration bombing country after country was a shocker evenfor her. She was saying beware the ‘new’ colonialism – stay with the oldversion. She said that Africa should be wary of friends who only deal withelites. Okay, it’s been nice knowing you, Hil. Bye. Clinton said that ‘we arebeginning to see a lot of problems’ in China that would intensify over the nextten years. She gave the example of Chinese efforts to control the Internet –while back at home her husband was calling for an organisation to beestablished, either by America or the United Nations, to censor the Internet.His wife-of-convenience told Africa that there ‘are more lessons to learn fromthe United States and democracies’. Yeah, don’t touch them with a bargepole."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00356.jpg] Figure 283: The statue of Albert Pike in Washington PIKE’S WARAlbert Pike is one of the most celebrated Freemasons in American Freemasonichistory and his statue stands next to the police headquarters in Washington D.C.(Fig 283). He also made a wonderful contribution to peace, love and harmony byhelping to establish the Ku Klux Klan. Cheers, Al. Pike was a Sovereign GrandCommander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry and major Illuminati operative inthe 19th century. He is said to have written a letter in 1871 to anotherinfamous Illuminati agent, the Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, describing three worldwars that together would transform the world into the global dictatorship that Iam exposing here. Many say that the letter was a fake, but it is amazing howdocuments dismissed as fraudulent or forgeries have this uncanny ability to beworks of amazing prophecy with the passage of events. The letter says that thefirst war would overthrow the czars in Russia through a conflict between theBritish and Germanic empires. Remember it was the Rothschilds who funded andorchestrated the Rothschild Zionist Russian Revolution. Pike said that thesecond war would lead to political Zionism establishing the sovereign State ofIsrael in Palestine; and he said this about World War III: > The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences> caused by the ‘agentu’ of the ‘Illuminati’ between the political Zionists and> the leaders of the Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that> Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel)> mutually destroy each other.

You’ll see that it says that Islam and political Zionism (the State of Israel)‘mutually destroy each other’. Rothschild Zionism made sure that Jewish peoplewere savagely treated in Germany to win public sympathy to establish Israel. Nowthey are being set up again. It was reported in July 2009 that the RussianPresident, Dmitry Medvedev, and Chinese President, Hu Jintao, had issued an‘urgent warning’ to the United States that if it allowed an Israeli nuclearattack on Iran, ‘world war will be our response’. The plan is to devastate themajor powers in the world – the United States, Europe, Russia and China – andthen introduce their global structure of centralised dictatorship with a globalarmy ‘to stop a world war ever happening again’. American independentjournalist, Jim Tucker, has been pursuing the Bilderberg Group for decades andhe is largely responsible for bringing its manipulations to public attention.His sources within Bilderberg have proved to be very accurate over the years andhe reports that the Bilderbergers called for a ‘big war’ at their conference inSt Moritz, Switzerland, in the summer of 2011. Tucker sources quote KeithAlexander, director of the US National Security Agency, as saying that they need‘a big war involving several countries to advance our goals of a globaleconomy’, and complaining that the pressure to end the attacks on Libya wasgrowing to ‘dangerous’ levels. He quotes John Kerr, deputy chairman of RoyalDutch Shell and a member of the British House of Lords as saying: ‘The recessionmay keep coverage [of Bilderberg] down. Europe has many independent papers, butthey go low-budget. We have made calls to Rupert Murdoch, still our goodfriend.’ Tucker’s sources said that the Bilderberg Group wanted to expand thewar in Libya into a ‘huge bloodletting’ in the Middle East while maintaining theworld economic recession through 2012. The Bilderbergers were addressed byoutgoing US Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, who was secretly slipped into themeeting to avoid publicity, Tucker said. Gates called for more effort by theNetherlands, Spain and Turkey and urged Germany and Poland to join the war. Hesaid that the European NATO members faced ‘the very real possibility ofcollective military irrelevance’ unless they committed more money and troops.The speech was reported by London’s Financial Times which said he had beenaddressing a ‘gathering of dignitaries’. Jim Tucker’s sources quoted oneBilderberger saying of Barack Obama: ‘… he’s a good soldier and he’ll followorders’.This is what events in the Middle East and North Africa are really about, andthe pieces are being moved into place with the lines between the ‘West’ andRussia/China being ever more clearly drawn. People must start to get involved inchallenging this whole agenda. If we don’t, a nightmare scenario will ensue."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00357.jpg] This is not, as you can see, a time for faint hearts. There are some veryserious challenges that face us, and one of them is the potential for atechnology known as HAARP. George Galloway, a former British Member ofParliament who claims to be a ‘left-wing radical’, ridiculed on his radio showany suggestion that the Japanese earthquake in March 2011 had been triggered bythe Alaska-based High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP.Galloway’s instant derision was no surprise. There are few on the planet moreignorant of the forces behind world events than what is called the ‘traditionalleft’. They will have no part to play in dismantling the structure of humanenslavement until they decide to open their minds and get informed rather thanrattle out the platitudes and clichés of the manipulated and irrelevantleft–right ‘battlefield’. The fact that people like Galloway – a Member ofParliament for 23 years – are so clueless about the potential of HAARP showsjust how far that mind-set has to go to understand the world as it is, ratherthan as they have been programmed to believe it is. I am not saying for a momentthat Galloway and his like-thinkers have done no good at all. He has spoken outvigorously over the years to expose the plight of the Palestinians, and that’s alaudable contribution. His jousts with biased television interviewers and a USSenate Committee have also been memorable. But Galloway and his mentality arechallenging the dots while not connecting them to see the picture. The leftversus right political ‘spectrum’ has been constructed to divide and rule thepeople, while the same network controls and funds both ‘sides’ and so dictatesthe political agendas and their direction. George Galloway is every bit a pawnas, say, Margaret Thatcher, John McCain or Sarah Palin. They are simply calledleft and right, red or blue, in the same way that pawns in a chess game may bedifferent colours, but they are the same pawns with the same worth in the samegame. ‘Left’ and ‘right’ have both spent so long fighting each other inmeaningless battles for supremacy that the world has passed them by. Awarenesshas moved on as others outside of politics have taken responsibility for lookingfar deeper into global events than the ‘left’ and ‘right’ could begin toimagine; and this brings us to HAARP (Figs 284[../Text/index_split_152.html#filepos1132216] and 285[../Text/index_split_152.html#filepos1132258]).It is no longer possible to understand what is happening with the world andhuman behaviour without adding the weather-manipulating, earthquake-causing,mind-controlling HAARP to the list of possibilities. HAARP manipulates theionosphere in the upper atmosphere to do its dastardly deeds (Fig 286[../Text/index_split_154.html#filepos1132806]). The ionosphere is anelectrically-charged region starting around 50 miles above the Earth andextending for hundreds more. It consists of ionising radiation that is deadly tohumans. The ionosphere and the stratosphere below protect us from the worstradiation excesses of the Sun, while the ozone layer filters most of theultraviolet light before it reaches the Earth’s surface. If this didn’t happenwe would be fried. The ozone layer has been damaged already, and now they aremessing with the ionosphere. When George Galloway shook his head in disbeliefthat anyone could suggest a HAARP connection to the Japanese earthquake andtsunami, he was betraying a lack of understanding of (a) what the technology iscapable of, and (b) the existence of a network of sheer undiluted evil that iswilling to use the technology to cause chaos, devastation and death. Work on theHAARP facility in Alaska began in 1993 and was, we are told, completed in 2007.HAARP is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University ofAlaska and the deeply sinister Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA), the technology development arm of the US Department of Defense. It is,in other words, a military operation; and if DARPA is involved, its agenda willbe focused on human control and manipulation – and worse. This is, after all,what DARPA was created to do. What we can see in Alaska is not the entire extentof the HAARP technology. It is much more extensive than this and connects withother facilities around the world that are being added to the network all thetime. There is no way that countries like Russia and China are not involved withsimilar ‘research’, either. In fact, we know about the Sura Ionospheric HeatingFacility near the Russian town of Vasilsursk, and there are other suchfacilities around the world. Researchers have connected HAARP technology to theblue spiral of light that appeared in the sky over northern Norway in December2009 on the eve of Barack Obama’s Nobel Prize acceptance speech in the country(Fig 287 [../Text/index_split_155.html#filepos1133171]). The light stopped inmid-air and began to move in a spiral shape before a blue-green light shot outfrom its centre and stayed visible for ten to twelve minutes beforedisappearing. You can see the footage on YouTube. The light appeared very closeto the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) facility.This is described as a ‘HAARP antenna farm’, and there are HAARP-connectedfacilities being built around the world."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00358.jpg] Figure 284: The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00359.jpg]Figure 285: "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00360.jpg] Figure 286: HAARP is manipulating the ionosphere to manipulate life on Earth andcreate an energetic shield "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00361.jpg] Figure 287: The spiral light in Norway on the eve of Obama’s Nobel Peace Prizeaward The Israeli and Chinese governments were bound to be involved in this sort oftechnology, and this turns out to be the case. Leuren Moret, an independentAmerican scientist, has conducted detailed research on HAARP and relatedtechnologies. She confirms a connection to China, Britain, Sweden, theNetherlands, Brazil and other South American countries. She describes HAARP as a‘Zionist/fascist partnership’ to commit global genocide, plunder the earth andsteal resources from the Third World by knowing where they are located (HAARPcan ‘X-ray’ the earth). She said: ‘It is not a military battle with othermilitaries; it is countries targeting their own citizens.’ That is preciselywhat it is. A major Rothschild Zionist connection to HAARP is the SwedishWallenberg family who are dubbed the ‘Swedish Rothschilds’. They are a highlysignificant strand in the web, although most people outside of Sweden will neverhave heard of them. One of their number, Raoul Wallenberg, was celebrated as ahero for helping Jews escape the Nazis in Hungary when, in fact, he made afortune selling, yes, selling, fake passports to them. Some of the bloodlinesmight call themselves ‘Jewish’, but they are as contemptuous of the mass ofJewish people as they are of the rest of us. Raoul Wallenberg’s sister is themother-in-law of former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who married into thefamily in a case of ‘like-attracts-like’. Another confirmation that HAARP is aglobal rather than purely an American operation is Roald Zinurovich Sagdeev, aleading Russian scientist who served on a scientific committee developing theHAARP project. Sagdeev was the former Director of the Space Research Institute –the Soviet Union equivalent of NASA – and an expert in nuclear science andplasma physics. HAARP is not an ‘American’ mind-control, weather-changing,earthquake-causing technology. It is the bloodlines’ technology, and thereforeinvolves those serving the bloodline no matter what their apparent nationality.INMATES RUNNING THE ASYLUMSo now we have the potential for energy wars, weather wars and geological wars,and they have already begun. HAARP fires in either continuous or pulsing formincredibly powerful electromagnetic radio waves at a specific point in theionosphere in the upper Earth atmosphere causing it to vibrate and ‘bulge’.HAARP can cause earthquakes by making the ionosphere vibrate at the point ofimpact and this resonance then connects with a related point on the Earth’ssurface which is ‘entrained’, or made to resonate in sympathy, with thevibrations triggered in the ionosphere. This resonating electromagnetic ‘laser’beam between the target area in the ionosphere and the target area on the groundcan cause the Earth to shift and hence an earthquake occurs. This is mosteffective, of course, if you target a location in a geologically unstable area.Scientists have found that earthquakes inflict changes upon the ionosphere andmagnetosphere, and HAARP is doing the same thing but in reverse. HAARP turns theionosphere into a radio transmitter, and the target point on the earth is the‘receiver’. What a coincidence that the frequency range in which HAARPbroadcasts is the same as that which causes earthquakes. Everything is vibrationin its base form, and if you distort the earth vibrationally andelectromagnetically this will play through to distortion at the ‘physical’(holographic) level. The interaction between the HAARP radio beam and theionosphere magnifies the power a thousand times, and this can generate more than3.6 billion watts. By affecting the ionosphere, HAARP can affect the wholeatmosphere from the farthest point down to the ground. The official story isthat HAARP was established for scientific research of the ionosphere; but that’slike saying that cruise missiles were developed to research the effect ofexplosions on buildings and people. HAARP is manipulating and superheating theionosphere, and as the energy waves bounce back to Earth they can cause a rangeof vibrational distortions that manifest as earthquakes, volcanic activity,changing weather patterns and extreme weather events. HAARP can also impact onhuman thought and perception, among much else, and can produce an explosiongreater than that of nuclear weapons, which it is now on the way to makingredundant.In the late 1990s, a report by the European Parliament’s Foreign AffairsSubcommittee on Security and Disarmament highlighted the real and potentialdangers of HAARP. Representatives of NATO and the United States were invited tothe hearing on which the report was based, but they refused to participate eventhough HAARP is funded by taxpayers and has the potential to affect the lives ofeveryone on the planet. There is no accountability because HAARP is actuallycontrolled by the global military establishment, and that operates beyond therealms of politicians and checks, balances and accountability. These people area law unto themselves no matter who is nominally in political office. The waythat HAARP is being used is illegal under international treaties, but then mostof what the bloodlines do is illegal under the laws they impose on everyoneelse. These people will do what they like as long as we continue to allow them.The European Parliament document said: > … [With its] far-reaching impact on the environment, HAARP is a matter of> global concern and we have to ask whether its advantages really outweigh the> risks … The environmental impact and the ethical aspect must be closely> examined before any further research and testing takes place … HAARP is a> project of which the public is almost completely unaware, and this needs to be> remedied. This was written in 1999. Nothing has changed except that dedicated researchershave ensured greater awareness about HAARP and what it can do. Nothing has been‘closely examined’ before further research and testing takes place. TheHAARPists have gone on their sadistic way in total contempt of humanity and theconsequences for our world. The document says that the electrical properties ofthe atmosphere can manipulate enormous forces and would have devastating effectson an enemy if used as a weapon. The report said that HAARP can deliver millionsof times more energy to an exact location than any other conventional source.This energy can also be directed at a moving target – worth remembering whenaircraft or flocks of birds fall out of the sky for no apparent reason. Thereport highlights the potential of HAARP to: manipulate global weather patterns(it’s a cinch with this technology); disrupt the communications of others whileitself continuing to communicate without disturbance; and ‘X-ray’ the earth tofind oil, gas and other resources. The bloodlines know far more than governmentsabout where the resources are, and those locations are then targeted militarilyor, as with Haiti, with engineered earthquakes to take over and secure theresource assets that the target nation may not even know exist. The resourcelocation data is also shared with their oil and other corporations. Anyonewithout access to HAARP simply could not compete. HAARP can also scan forunderground military facilities, anyone hiding underground and stockpiles ofhidden weapons. HAARP has been operational since the 1990s, and this is yet moreconfirmation that they knew Saddam Hussein did not have ‘weapons of massdestruction’ when they were lying to justify the invasion of 2003. Funny howthey couldn’t find Osama bin Laden in his ‘cave’ either. Another potential ofHAARP to keep in mind is its ability to project holographic images that looklike the real thing. I have written in other books about ‘Project Blue Beam’,which is planning to manipulate human perception by projecting holographicimages of UFOs and religious deities into the sky. I will put this into contextwith the overall plan in the final chapter.EARTHQUAKES ON DEMANDI am sure that HAARP was used to trigger the devastating earthquake in Haiti in2010 in which more than 200,000 people died (Fig 288[../Text/index_split_156.html#filepos1145053]). American troops arrived in Haitiso fast to secure control of the airports that there is no way that they werenot already on standby. The day before the earthquake, there were meetings at USSouthern Command in Miami preparing for a scenario of providing relief to Haitiin the event of a hurricane. The next day the earthquake struck, and theydecided to ‘go live’ with their system. How very convenient. The US militaryimmediately took control of everything, to the point where genuine aid agencieswere complaining that they couldn’t get into the country because the US militarywas refusing them permission to land (Fig 289[../Text/index_split_157.html#filepos1145352]). Then onto the scene, right oncue, appeared those two bastions of decency, fair play and human empathy, BillClinton and ‘shapeshifter’, Boy George Bush. They were ‘appointed’ by Obama tohead the ‘Clinton Bush Haiti Fund’ (a ‘relief organization’), and ‘to overseelong-term reconstruction and relief efforts in the country’ (Fig 290[../Text/index_split_158.html#filepos1145729]). No – to oversee long-termcontrol and exploitation of the considerable oil and other resources in andaround Haiti. This is the real reason that Bill Clinton was appointed as theUnited Nations ‘special envoy’ to Haiti nine months prior to the earthquake.Clinton and Bush disappeared from the scene after the cameras had gone; and morethan a year later bodies were still being found in the rubble, less than fiveper cent of which had been cleared, and around a million people were stillhomeless. Haiti remains under military occupation by the United NationsStabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) which is despised by the Haiti people who areabused, robbed and intimidated by this brutal and criminal occupation force. Ihave heard speculation here and there that earthquakes are being caused bynuclear devices positioned on fault lines, and in some cases that may well betrue, but with HAARP there is no need. A nuclear device works through themanipulation of energy to cause an extraordinary explosion. What does HAARP do?It manipulates and generates, via the ionosphere, massive levels of focusedenergy. Weapons directing focused energy are the cutting edge when it comes todestruction and killing people."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00362.jpg] Figure 288: The Haiti earthquake in 2010. "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00363.jpg] Figure 289: Here come the boys. They were ready to move in as soon theearthquake happened. Pure coincidence, of course "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00364.jpg] Figure 290: Clinton and Bush – they care so much about downtrodden humanity Strange lights and rainbow colours have been seen in the sky around the time ofearthquakes in the last few years, and these are said to be an indication ofHAARP activity. This is what people saw in the sky before the Haiti and Chileearthquakes of 2010, and the same phenomena have been reported with otherearthquakes, including the one that devastated Japan in 2011. HAARP heats theionosphere, and so the atmosphere heats up before these engineered earthquakesoccur. Data released by Dimitar Ouzounov and his team at the NASA Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Maryland confirms that there was rapid and unexplainable(without HAARP) heating of the ionosphere directly over the epicentre of theJapanese earthquake in the days before it happened. Ouzounov published thefindings in Technology Review, published by the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT). The article theorised that maybe the heating was caused byradioactive radon released by a disturbance in the fault line; but it alsorevealed data that describes precisely the effects that HAARP has on theionosphere. The HAARP Induction Magnetometer, which reads frequencies in theplanet’s magnetic field, revealed that in the run-up to the earthquake there wasa consistent ultra-low frequency of around 2.5 hertz – the same frequencyproduced by a natural earthquake. There were also concentric heat rings abovethe quake’s epicentre. There is also a common theme of a US naval presence atsea close to some of these earthquake locations. This was the case with Haitiand Fukushima in Japan. William S Cohen (Rothschild Zionist), then US Secretaryof Defense, said in 1997 that forces were ‘engaging even in an eco-typeterrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes and volcanoesremotely through the use of electromagnetic waves’. Yes, ‘forces’ called theAmerican military that Cohen represented. The Japanese earthquake and tsunamiwere engineered to happen using HAARP technology under the cover of a ‘natural’event. The Fukushima nuclear plant was fitted with small nuclear devicesmasquerading as security cameras and sensors, installed by a company based atthe location of Israel’s nuclear weapons programme. Why would they do that? Theexplosions led to the colossal, and so far continuing, release of radiationwhich the bloodlines want for reasons that I will come to in the next chapter.There are also indications that Japan was not totally ‘playing ball’ with thebloodline agenda. They know that insiders in other countries will be well awarethat the earthquake was caused by technological means, and the message was: seewhat happens if you say no to us. The bloodline network developed the atomicbomb and had two of them dropped on Japan in 1945 when there was no need ormilitary justification when you look at the hidden history. This was done toshow the destructive power of nuclear weapons and to terrify people during thesoon-to-come ‘Cold War’ (see: … And the Truth Shall Set You Free). Thebloodlines were messing with the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field longbefore HAARP went on stream. The European Parliament report on HAARP says it islinked to 50 years of intensive space research for military purposes, includingas part of ‘Star Wars’, with the intention of controlling the upper layers ofthe atmosphere and communications. The report described nuclear experiments inthe Van Allen Belts – areas of charged plasma radiation between 4,800 and 32,000miles above the Earth: > From the 1950s the USA conducted explosions of nuclear material in the Van> Allen Belts to investigate the effect of the electromagnetic pulse generated> by nuclear weapon explosions at these heights on radio communications and the> operation of radar. This created new magnetic radiation belts which covered> nearly the whole earth. The electrons travelled along magnetic lines of force> and created an artificial Aurora Borealis above the North Pole. > These military tests are liable to disrupt the Van Allen belt for a long> period. The earth’s magnetic field could be disrupted over large areas, which> would obstruct radio communications. According to US scientists it could take> hundreds of years for the Van Allen belt to return to normal. HAARP could> result in changes in weather patterns. It could also influence whole> ecosystems, especially in the sensitive Antarctic regions. > Another damaging consequence of HAARP is the occurrence of holes in the> ionosphere caused by the powerful radio beams. The ionosphere protects us from> incoming cosmic radiation. The hope is that the holes will fill again, but our> experience of change in the ozone layer points in the other direction. This> means substantial holes in the ionosphere that protects us. How many people know that the American – and Russian – military have explodednuclear weapons in the Van Allen Belt? More than 300 megatons of nuclear bombswere exploded in the Earth’s atmosphere in the 1950s and 1960s. The Van AllenBelts were quite weak before these crazies intervened and increased theirstrength hundreds of times with the release of radiation from nuclearexplosions. This has made it far more dangerous and costly for spacecraftpassing through the Belts, because the effect of the radiation means that crafthave to go through them far more quickly than they would otherwise have to do.The explosions also created new radiation belts that were not there previously.Many scientists had opposed the project for fear of the consequences for naturalsystems, but the maniacs did it anyway. The first nuclear test – known as the‘Trinity Test’ – was carried out by the Manhattan Project in 1945, and manyothers followed. Figures released from the US National Cancer Institute showthat cancer rates have increased every year since 1945. The Manhattan Projectdeveloped the first atomic bomb during World War II led by Julius RobertOppenheimer (Rothschild Zionist) at the Los Alamos National Laboratories in NewMexico. Oppenheimer was known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb’, while thescientist referred to as the ‘father of the hydrogen bomb’ was Edward Teller(Rothschild Zionist). Teller also worked on the Manhattan Project and so did hisfellow developer of the hydrogen bomb, Stanislaw Marcin Ulam (RothschildZionist). Other scientists involved in the Manhattan Project were Leó Szilárd(Rothschild Zionist); Eugene Wigner (Rothschild Zionist); Hans Bethe (RothschildZionist); Felix Bloch (Rothschild Zionist); and Robert Serber (RothschildZionist). I could go on and on. The Manhattan Project was approved and funded byPresident Franklin D Roosevelt (Rothschild Zionist) after receiving a letter in1939 from Albert Einstein (Rothschild Zionist) which had been dictated by LeóSzilárd (Rothschild Zionist). The letter warned that the Nazis might developnuclear weapons. I have tried to identify a theme that connects all thesescientists that gave the world nuclear weapons, but so far I can’t find one. Imust look harder.TESLA TOLD USThe patents for HAARP technology were written and secured by Bernard J Eastlundand other scientists and were owned by their employer, ARCO Power TechnologiesIncorporated (APTI), a subsidiary of oil giant Atlantic Richfield. APTI beganthe construction of the HAARP facility and was sold in 1994, with the patents,to E-Systems, a global Intelligence contractor working for agencies like theCIA. From E-Systems the HAARP contract and patents passed to Raytheon, one ofthe world’s biggest defence contractors and Illuminati to its paperclips, andfinally to BAE Systems North America (now simply BAE Systems). The US governmentclaims that HAARP is a civilian research project, when it is completelycontrolled by the military and overseen by DARPA, the technological developmentarm of the Defense Department. HAARP patents and related patents say that thetechnology can: • Deliver unprecedented amounts of energy at specific locations in theatmosphere that are far more precise than a nuclear weapon. • Interfere with global communications systems while HAARP communicationsremain unaffected. • Block incoming missiles. • Manipulate weather. • Manipulate the atmosphere by changing the molecular composition of anatmospheric region. • Create nuclear-sized explosions without radiation using electromagneticpulses. • Allow for over-the-horizon radar."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00365.jpg] Figure 291: Genius of the 20th century The technology is based on the work of the brilliant Serbian (born in what ismodern-day Croatia) inventor and engineer, Nikola Tesla (1856–1943). Hediscovered alternating current (AC) electricity that gave us the electricalpower that we know today, and many other systems of power and communication forwhich others have been given the credit (Fig 291). Tesla held 45 of the 46 basicAC patents, invented 16 different types of lighting and had his laboratorybrilliantly illuminated. He was way ahead of his time and he understood theelectromagnetic nature of the Universe. Bernard Eastlund mentions Tesla in hisHAARP patents and Tesla revealed the potential of his technology in an articlein The New York Times in 1940. The article talked about a Tesla invention thathe called the ‘teleforce’, which was based on ‘an entirely new principle ofphysics’ which ‘no one ever dreamed about’. Tesla said that an invisible beamcould ‘melt’ aircraft motors at a distance of 250 miles, so that an invisible‘Chinese Wall of Defense’ would be built around a country. The teleforce wouldoperate with a beam ‘one- hundred-millionth of a square centimetre’ in diameter.Guglielmo Marconi has been given the credit for discovering radiocommunications, but he stole the idea from Tesla who developed an advancedunderstanding of radio waves – the medium employed by HAARP. Marconi worked forTesla for nine months and stole all the technological information. The USSupreme Court ruled that Marconi stole 14 of Tesla’s patents. Tesla could seethe potential for locating or tracking objects, which today we call radar, andfor ‘X-raying’ the earth to see what lies inside. Tesla set out to produce freeelectricity for everyone and that is perfectly possible today, but it issuppressed to keep people dependent on paying the bills of the bloodline energycorporations. The Universe is alive with electricity, for goodness sake. Why dowe need to plunder the Earth? We don’t. Tesla also saw the military potentialfor the energetic principles that he discovered. He said that his transmittercould produce 100 million volts of pressure with currents up to 100 billionwatts, and if the radio frequency was resonating at two Megahertz the energyreleased would be the equivalent of ten megatons of TNT. HAARP cannot causeearthquakes? HAARP cannot manipulate the weather and be used as a weapon? Teslacaused artificial earthquakes when his own building and neighbouring onesstarted to shake violently during an experiment. Thousands of windows werebroken before he could turn off the technology. In 1935, the New York Americanpublished an article headlined: ‘Tesla’s Controlled Earthquakes’ in which hetalked about the effect of transmitting resonance through the Earth: > The rhythmical vibrations pass through the Earth with almost no loss of energy> … [It] becomes possible to convey mechanical effects to the greatest> terrestrial distances and produce all kinds of unique effects … The invention> could be used with destructive effect in war … Tesla said he had the technology to ‘split the Earth like an apple’, and it issobering to think that he died in 1943. What can be done now? The Russians andChinese have this technology which has more power than nuclear weapons, and sodo the Israelis through the Rothschild control of the United States. It iscalled HAARP, and as one government insider said, it could deliver enough powerto make the Earth flip over. When you see the potential for the cutting edge ofhuman technology, it is easy to see how the fundamentally moretechnologically-advanced Reptilian Alliance could have caused the catastrophesthat I described earlier and allowed them to hijack Saturn.WHAT’S WITH THE WEATHER?Tesla was able to artificially-generate violent lighting storms that startedhundreds of forest fires and blew out electrical grids in two states. Anyonethink that HAARP might be able to manipulate the weather? Of course it can. Theyhave been doing exactly that for decades – first, in the early days, with cloudseeding to make it rain; and now creating manufactured droughts, extreme andincessant rain and snow storms, tornadoes, hurricanes – almost whatever theychoose. Native Americans and other tribal peoples could change the weather withrain dances and suchlike when they were generating an electromagnetic field thatcauses rain clouds to form. Weather is only energy vibrating to differentfrequencies, and if you generate those frequencies you produce the weather thatgoes with them. It’s dead simple. The Wall Street Journal reported that aRussian company called Elate Intelligent Technologies Inc. was sellingweather-control equipment using the slogan: ‘Weather made to order’. IgorPirogoff, a director of the company, said that the technology could have turnedthe devastating Hurricane Andrew in 1992 ‘into a wimpy little squall’. Yes, andthe other way round, too, with the weather-changing technology available today –especially HAARP. Weather manipulation was subject to international law 40 yearsago with the United Nations Convention on the Prohibition of Military or AnyOther Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD). Would theyintroduce laws to stop what they thought could not be done?? Weather is beingmanipulated all the time, and Rothschild Zionists are heavily involved. Israeliscientists once suggested using lethal ecoli bacteria to seed clouds because itworked in warm weather and the alternative didn’t. Mad professors do exist invery large numbers and they may well have covertly done that – they’re crazyenough. What’s a bit of e-coli when you are exploding nuclear weapons in the VanAllen Belts and punching holes in the ionosphere? HAARP is being used as anow-vital cog in the bloodline global machine. They can manipulate the weatherand blame it on ‘climate change’, for example. Al Gore quotes weather extremessuch as droughts, floods and forest fires to sell his Big Lie, and all of thesethings can be easily created by HAARP. Tesla started hundreds of fires with histechnology in the first half of the last century.The bloodlines want to destabilise and take control of Pakistan, and devastatingand record-breaking floods struck the country in 2010. Around one fifth of theland in Pakistan was underwater with some 20 million people losing their homesand livelihoods. Two thousand people were killed. HAARP’s signature was all overthe multiple deadly tornadoes in the American Midwest in 2011 when the regionwas also hit by torrential rains that flooded the Mississippi and Missouririvers to record levels, together with large snowfalls in the mountains thatfeed the rivers. A tornado outbreak of historic proportions struck the Midwestand Northeastern United States; it became known as the ‘Super Outbreak’, with300 tornadoes between April 25th and 28th that killed more than 300 people. Atone point there were 118 tornadoes within 24 hours. I bet they were laughing sohard at the HAARP facility. What fun. HAARP was operational at this timeaccording to its website data, and storms and tornadoes were being accuratelypredicted by people tracking HAARP’s effect on the weather. Tornadoes are causedby a fast-rotating electromagnetic field, and the same is true for hurricanes.Creating these is child’s play for HAARP. Send a hurricane to New Orleans, haveyour explosive device ready to breach the levee and the city is yours to stealand take over. Another bloodline target is all farmers who are not working forthe Illuminati corporations. I am writing this as the bloated Missouri andMississippi rivers carry their record volumes of water to the sea. Farmland isbeing inundated, and levees have been demolished to protect people further downthe river – or that’s what they tell us, anyway. The effect has been to destroyvast areas of crops, and with that the livelihoods and communities ofnon-corporation farmers, en route. The federal government then sent letters tothese farmers offering to buy their land through the Army Corps of Engineers.This is the same Army Corps of Engineers that was blowing up levees to floodfarms and communities on the premise of protecting people further downstream.This was just a scam to steal the people’s land. George Soros (RothschildZionist) has embarked on a frenzy of buying up farmland and grain storagecompanies in the United States and Australia through a company called Gavilon.Control of food supplies is a bloodline ‘must-have’, and they plan to engineerfood shortages in the West as they have caused famines in Africa and elsewhere.Weather control = food control. Another potential weather impact of HAARP is tomanipulate the jet streams, to alter the natural west-to-east path of high orlow pressure systems and direct them to target areas. We are told that jetstreams are formed by the planet’s rotation and atmospheric heating.HAARP has the potential to seriously mess with Earth’s magnetic field, and thisis showing many signs of being destabilised. The UK’s The Independent reportedthat the magnetic north pole was ‘moving faster than at any time in humanhistory, threatening everything from the safety of modern transport systems tothe traditional navigation routes of migrating animals’. Magnetic north was inthe frozen wilderness of Ellesmere Island in Canada for two centuries, but it isnow relocating at a speed of some 40 miles a year in the direction of Russia,with the speed increasing by a third in the last decade. This is distortingcompasses by about one degree every five years, and because of this the USFederal Aviation Administration has to re-evaluate runway codes every five yearsto keep them in sync with aircraft instruments. Scientists, and others,speculate that all this may be the prelude to a ‘flip’ or reversal of themagnetic poles which is calculated to have last happened some 780,000 years agoat the start of what is believed to be the longest stable period in the lastfive million years. It may be a natural phenomenon; but it may not. We are allsynchronised to some extent by the nature of the magnetic field, but this isespecially true of the animal world, not least whales, dolphins, birds, andsuchlike which have their directional antennae guided by interaction with thefield. If they have to change runway codes to keep aircraft on the right course,clearly animals are going to be affected if they don’t do the same reprogrammingof their own ‘Sat Navs’. Thousands of whales, dolphins and porpoises are foundbeached and stranded on coastlines around the world every year. Cape Cod in theUnited States and shores around New Zealand are among the most common locations.One example was the 107 pilot whales that died after being stranded off NewZealand’s South Island. Even more mysterious are the mass deaths of birds andsea life with millions of fish found dead in a Californian harbour in oneincident (Fig 292). Other unexplained bird and sea-life deaths include: • 450 red-winged blackbirds, brown-headed cowbirds, grackles and starlingsfound on the road in Baton Rouge, Louisiana • 3,000 blackbirds on roofs and roads in Beebe, Arkansas • Thousands of ‘devil crabs’ washed up along the Kent coast near Thanet inEngland • Thousands of drum fish washed up along a 20-mile stretch of the ArkansasRiver • Tens of thousands of small fish dead in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland • Thousands of dead fish found floating in a Florida creek • Hundreds of snapper fish found dead in New Zealand • Scores of American Coots found dead on a Texas highway bridgeimage [../Images/00366.jpg] Figure 292: Massive sea-life and bird-life deaths could be the work of HAARP There might be different explanations in some cases, but I am sure that in mostinstances of these mass deaths there is a common factor. Thousands of birds fellout of the sky and an estimated 100,000 fish died at the same time in the samegeographical region of Arkansas, so there is a connecting factor in all this –or much of it, anyway. There is a very good chance that this factor is HAARP.‘THEY GAVE US THEIR MIND’HAARP has the potential to control the minds of the global population en masse.The human brain operates on certain frequencies and if you broadcast informationon those frequencies the brain will decode it as a person’s own thoughts andperceptions. HAARP’s thoughts and perceptions would become human thoughts andperceptions. I have some news for you … HAARP can broadcast in the samefrequency band as the human brain. This band is known as Extremely LowFrequency, or ELF. Every thought and emotion has its own frequency. Dr AndrijaPuharich, an American medical and parapsychological researcher, realised nearly60 years ago that psychics operate on another frequency when they are‘connecting’ (8Hz), while frequencies of 10.80Hz produces ‘riotous behaviour’and 6.6Hz makes people depressed. He also changed DNA by using frequencies, andthat is another goal of HAARP. Technology capable of manipulating enemy troopsmentally and emotionally to give up and surrender has been around for a longtime, but HAARP has the potential to do this to the world. The psychos have beenrecording the wavelengths of human emotions and storing them in a sort of‘Emotion Library’ to be broadcast at a target and trigger those same emotionsindividually and collectively – such as: ‘I have no power’, ‘Everything ishopeless, just give in’. Dr Andrew Michrowski, Technologies Specialist with theCanadian Department of State, and President of the Planetary Association forClean Energy (PACE), wrote many years ago that almost anything could be insertedinto a target brain and such insertions would be processed by ‘biosystems’ asinternally generated data/effects: ‘Words, phrases, images, sensations andemotions could be directly inserted and experienced in the biological targets asinternal states, codes, emotions, thoughts and ideas.’ Once an externalfrequency has synchronised with brain activity it can then change thatfrequency, and thus brainwave patterns. This is known as ‘entrainment’. Brainchemistry, thoughts, emotions and perceptions all change when brainwavefrequencies change. Something similar has been done to humanity for aeons viathe Saturn–Moon Matrix, but they now have to increase the strength of thiscollective perception-control system, for reasons I will come to in the finalchapter, by using technology on Earth. Covert projects in countries such as theUnited States, Russia, Britain and China have been researching and experimentingwith external control of the human brain for over 70 years. This is the ultimatedream for people obsessed with controlling others. Russian mind-manipulationmessages broadcast into the United States were publicly revealed in the 1970s.This became known as the ‘Woodpecker’ signal because it sounded like repetitivetapping. Woodpecker was an expansion of an earlier Russian experiment whichinvolved bombarding the American Embassy in Moscow with microwaves. The LosAngeles Times reported that the US ambassador had told staff that this couldcause emotional and behavioural problems and serious illness such as leukaemiaand cancer. Irradiated ambassadors, Charles Bohlen and Llewellyn Thompson, bothdied of cancer and The Boston Globe reported in 1976 that Ambassador WalterStoessel was suffering from a rare blood disease, and was bleeding from the eyesand suffering from headaches. American Intelligence knew about the microwaveattacks for years, but didn’t tell anyone at the embassy. They wanted to use itas an experiment themselves by observing the effects. This is the mentality thatruns the world. There are no ‘sides’, anyway, as I have stressed. The bloodlinesmanipulate through all countries, and to them the world is one country. Thisexplains the otherwise bizarre decision of the American authorities to sell a40-tonne ‘supermagnet’ to the Russians in 1977 in full knowledge that it wouldallow them to broadcast their signals into the United States. AmericanIntelligence, military and government supplied the technology that made theWoodpecker signal possible. They even sent American scientists to install itwhile the smokescreen ‘Cold War’ was still going on. Woodpecker was a bloodlineexperiment leading to the HAARP technology they have today. Lieutenant ColonelJohn B Alexander wrote an article in 1980 about Woodpecker in Military Review,the official publication of the US Army Command and General Staff College. Hesaid: > [Soviet Union] mind-altering techniques, designed to impact on an opponent are> well-advanced.

This is what HAARP has the potential to do – and more – on a global scale. Ihave written at great length in other books about the history of mind controland the horrors this ‘research’ has inflicted upon children and adults in theUnited States, Britain, Germany and elsewhere. Techniques have been developedthat allow for total external control of brain activity, and HAARP has beendesigned to broadcast information at human brain frequencies that people willdecode to be their own thoughts, beliefs and emotions. This is a major part ofthe plan to microchip the global population. They would be able to communicateinformation to the chip for mental and emotional manipulation, and assassinationfrom afar. The soulless nature of the people behind all this can be seen clearlywith Dr Jose Delgado, Professor of Physiology at Yale University, one of thebest-known mind control researchers who worked for the CIA. He was especiallyinterested in developing electronic implants for the control of behaviour.Delgado produced a report in 1969, and the same remarks appeared in theCongressional Record in 1974. It is worth reading this slowly to take in what isplanned for the entire human race unless we stop it: > We need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society. The> purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given> norm can be surgically mutilated. The individual may think that the most> important reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal point of> view. This lacks historical perspective. Man does not have the right to> develop his own mind. This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal. We> must electrically control the brain. Someday, armies and generals will be> controlled by electric stimulation of the brain. Delgado was mad, a complete fruitcake, but he worked for the CIA carrying outhorrendous experiments on animals and people, funded by the Office of NavalResearch which is now involved in HAARP. The New York Times reported onDelgado’s experiments in 1965 and described the effect on a bull: > Afternoon sunlight poured over the high wooden barriers into the ring, as the> brave bull bore down on the unarmed ‘matador’ – a scientist who had never> before faced a fighting bull. But the charging animal’s horns never reached> the man behind the red cape. > Moments before that could happen, Dr Jose Delgado, the scientist, pressed a> button on a small radio transmitter in his hand and the bull braked to a halt.> Then he pressed another button on the transmitter, and the bull obediently> turned to the right and trotted away. The bull was obeying commands in his> brain that were being called forth by electrical stimulation – by the radio> signals – of certain regions in which the fine wires had been painlessly> implanted the day before. Delgado said that he had conducted similar experiments on humans, but instead ofbeing arrested he received all the funding he required. Brave New World authorand insider, Aldous Huxley, talked about people being manipulated to ‘love theirservitude’, and this is another aspect of the HAARP/mind-control agenda. Butthis is not about people, as in conscious people, loving their servitude, butthe human body–computer being externally programmed to decode that sense ofreality. Kevin Warwick, Professor of Cybernetics at the University of Reading,England, said: ‘If a machine is passing down signals that keep you completelyhappy, then why not be part of the Matrix?’ Warwick is best-known for beingmicrochipped and promoting this as a great idea. If Warwick is an example ofwhat chips can do to you, I’ll give it a miss if it’s all the same. I prefer mysoul to a microchip, or anything else this ludicrous academic might suggest.Another CIA crazy in the era of Delgado was Dr Ivor Browning. He attached aradio receiver to the hypothalamus, or ‘pleasure centre’ in the brain, of adonkey. He externally directed the donkey to climb a mountain and return bystimulating the ‘pleasure centre’ when the donkey took the required route andswitching it off when there was deviation. When the ‘pleasure’ stopped, thedonkey would change direction until the ‘pleasure’ returned. This is the planfor humans, and HAARP is at the centre of this. The race to turn over allbroadcasting to digital is also connected to mass perception control. It isaimed at hacking the decoding process at the digital level of reality which iseven closer to experienced holographic reality than the waveform. Another ‘wayin’ is through Ultra High Frequency waves, or UHF, which can access perceptionthrough the subconscious mind. ‘Going digital’ is freeing up this band. The USDepartment of Defense is behind this technology, too, under the name of SilentSound Spread Spectrum (SSSS), and it is highly likely that it is planning to usedigital broadcasting as its ‘delivery system’ along with the technologies I havebeen describing.SMART GRID = MIND GRIDIf anyone needs confirmation by now that there is a globally-organisedconspiracy on a grand scale then I give you the ‘Smart Grid’. This is the planalready being rolled out to install a global grid that would supply homes withelectricity and information. Advocates describe it in their Orwellian jargon as‘an intelligent digitised energy-network delivering electricity in an optimumway from source to consumption’; and ‘integrated information, telecommunicationand power technologies with the existing electricity system’. There is also arelated brand called HomePlug, ‘the power alliance’ [cartel] which distributesInternet, HD video, digital music and other applications [information in otherswords] to the home’. Here is the sales-pitch garbage for ‘Smart Grids’ – andthen I will tell you the real reason the technology is being introduced: • Increased use of digital information and controls technology to improvereliability, security and efficiency of the electric grid. • Dynamic optimization of grid operations and resources, with fullcyber-security. • Deployment and integration of distributed resources and generation,including renewable resources. • Development and incorporation of demand response, demand-side resources,and energy-efficiency resources. • Deployment of ‘smart’ technologies (real-time, automated, interactivetechnologies that optimize the physical operation of appliances and consumerdevices) for metering, communications concerning grid operations and status, anddistribution automation. • Integration of ‘smart’ appliances and consumer devices. • Deployment and integration of advanced electricity-storage and peak-shavingtechnologies, including plug-in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, andthermal-storage air conditioning. • Provision to consumers of timely information and control options. • Development of standards for communication and interoperability ofappliances and equipment connected to the electric grid, including theinfrastructure serving the grid. • Identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessary barriers toadoption of smart grid technologies, practices and services.My goodness, talk about Orwellian. These people even talk like robots. Note thatlast point: ‘Identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessary barriersto adoption of smart grid technologies, practices and services.’ Translated fromthe Orwellian this means: ‘Identification of anything or anyone that might blockor not accept what we are imposing and take the necessary action to deal withthem, because you are having it whether you like it or not.’ Well we shouldn’t‘have it’; we should not even nearly ‘have it’ at any price, starting now. Theywant these grids in every country with all of them connected to create a globalgrid. Electrical systems can carry information, and these grids are designed todeliver mind control into your own home by using electricity andelectromagnetism to supply information to your brain. The new ‘energy-saving’lightbulbs that are increasingly being imposed by law around the world are partof this system. Those bulbs are constructed to be transmitters of information.They even look like transmitters (Fig 293[../Text/index_split_160.html#filepos1189493]). Crazy? Well, hold on. Dr RobertBeck, an expert in nuclear engineering, co-authored a scientific research paperwith Dr Michael A Persinger of Laurentian University in Canada, an expert in ELFradiation, in which they studied the potential of electromagnetic mind control.Dr Beck told a Psychotronics Association conference that human subjects exposedto certain ELF field patterns reported sensations of uneasiness, depression andforeboding. He said that he had measured the Russian Woodpecker signal and foundthat it was acting ‘like gangbusters … right in the window of humanpsychoactivity’. He then added this: ‘The signal was permeating power grids inthe United States, it was being picked up by power lines, re-radiated, it wascoming into homes on the light circuits …’ Dr Beck said those words in 1979, andwe are now being told to accept the Smart Grids which will deliver thesubliminal messages even more powerfully than Woodpecker because this electricaland telecommunication system is specifically designed to do that – right down tothe ‘energy-saving’ lightbulb transmitters. Accenture, the global management andtechnology consulting firm, is heavily involved in the Smart Grid roll out. MarkSpelman, Accenture’s head of strategy, said that Smart Grids were ‘the energyinternet of the future’. Smart Grids are in fact another form of the wirelessinformation Internet aimed at manipulating and programming human perception. Theclimate-change lie is being used once again to justify human enslavement throughthe transmitter bulbs and the ‘energy efficient’ Smart Grid. The system alsoallows the authorities to monitor your energy use minute by minute and turn yourheating down or off if they so choose. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory(owned by the US Department of Energy) described how the technology would work:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00367.jpg] Figure 293: Information transmitters on the Smart Grid ‘Internet’ disguised as‘green’ lightbulbs > The controller is essentially a simple computer chip that can be installed in> regular household appliances like dishwashers, clothes washers, dryers,> refrigerators, air conditioner and water heaters. The chip senses when there> is a disruption in the grid and turns the appliances off for a few seconds or> minutes to allow the grid to stabilize. The controllers also can be programmed> to delay the restart of the appliances. The delay allows the appliances to be> turned on one at a time rather than all at once to ease power restoration> following an outage. Your whole life would be controlled from afar by programmed computer systemsusing wireless communications that would constantly bathe your home and businessin radiation. The system will be able to monitor everything people do at homeonce it is fully operational. So-called ‘Smart Meters’ are being installed inCalifornia, and they have proved to be highly-controversial. Many are catchingfire, and people are suffering from the usual effects of the radiation they emit… extreme dizziness, nausea, flu-like symptoms, memory problems and insomnia.Smart Meters transmit wireless information in electromagnetic pulses to theelectricity supply, and this is what causes the ill health. They are trying tokill us and our children in our own homes. Smart Grids are supposed to saveenergy and cut electricity bills, but when a California television stationtested them against the old system they found the opposite was the case.Personal experience suggests that bills actually soar and when you read thesmall print of government legislation it is the people, not the energycorporations, who are footing the bill for installation. Smart Grids are beingimposed at a gathering pace in the United States on the back of billions infunding and incentives that appeared in Obama’s ‘stimulus package’ after he cameto power in 2009. All the major Illuminati players are involved such as IBM, GEand Siemens. Around ten million American homes have been installed with SmartMeters at the time of writing and they want this to be more than 50 million in2012. They are being introduced in Britain and Europe, and many Australians arereacting with great hostility as they are introduced there. The plan is to haveevery country in the world locked into the global Smart Grid. Money is no objectbecause this is a major programme within the global conspiracy. The Smart Gridis a two-way communication system that communicates information to the minds ofthe occupants and tracks their daily lives in great detail. People who refuse tohave them are being told they will have their electricity supply cut; so theyare, in truth, compulsory – just like the lightbulbs. Both are part of the sameAgenda. But, in fact, while the energy corporations say there can be no ‘optout’ from Smart Meters in America, the law says that people must ‘opt in’. Asone writer said: ‘No-one can be forced to comply with an unrevealed contractbetween private corporations, and to which you were never a party and had noknowledge of.’ The European Union wants 80 per cent of homes connected to thissystem by 2020. Jerry Day, an electronics and media expert from Burbank,California, listed his concerns about Smart Meters: > 1. They individually identify electrical devices inside the home and record> when they are operated causing invasion of privacy.> 2. They monitor household activity and occupancy in violation of rights and> domestic security.> 3. They transmit wireless signals which may be intercepted by unauthorized and> unknown parties. Those signals can be used to monitor behaviour and occupancy> and they can be used by criminals to aid criminal activity against the> occupants.> 4. Data about occupants’ daily habits and activities are collected, recorded> and stored in permanent databases which are accessed by parties not authorized> or invited to know and share that private data.> 5. Those with access to the smart meter databases can review a permanent> history of household activities complete with calendar and time-of-day metrics> to gain a highly invasive and detailed view of the lives of the occupants.> 6. Those databases may be shared with, or fall into the hands of criminals,> blackmailers, law enforcement, private hackers of wireless transmissions,> power company employees and other unidentified parties who may act against the> interests of the occupants under metered surveillance.> 7. ‘Smart Meters’ are, by definition, surveillance devices which violate> Federal and State wiretapping laws by recording and storing databases of> private and personal activities and behaviours without the consent or> knowledge of those people who are monitored.> 8. It is possible for example, with analysis of certain Smart Meter data, for> unauthorised and distant parties to determine medical conditions, sexual> activities, physical locations of persons within the home, vacancy patterns> and personal information and habits of the occupants.Put: ‘Smart Meters, Jerry Day’ into YouTube and you will see his video. Policeare already issuing an increasing number of subpoenas for the energy-use recordsof those that they suspect are growing marijuana in their homes. When yourelectricity usage goes up for any reason, you can face a police raid; and onsome occasions when they haven’t found marijuana they have charged people withother offences once they have gained access to their homes. A report by TheAssociated Press in July 2011 was also fundamentally connected with all this. APrevealed that a year-long ‘experiment’ was planned to start that would, ineffect, dismantle the national electricity grid in the United States (break theold so you can replace it with the new). The present grid has always run on thesame frequency in unison across the country so that power produced on one sideof the country can be fed to the other if necessary. The Associated Press reportsaid that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission planned to make various partsof the grid run at different frequencies – which means that it is no longer agrid at all. This could affect traffic lights, security systems and somecomputers, and make electrical clocks and appliances such as coffeemakers run upto 20 minutes fast. Demetrios Matsakis, head of the time service department atthe US Naval Observatory, said: ‘A lot of people are going to have things breakand they’re not going to know why.’ The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionsays that this nonsense was to make the grid (by then non-existent grid) morereliable. What a lie. When something so ridiculous is rolled out against alllogic, you know it is the Agenda at work. HAARP, Smart Grids, lightbulbtransmitters, and telecommunications antennae and technology (including cellphone receiver–transmitters) are all part of a vast global mind-control networkthat would turn humanity into fully-fledged mind-controlled zombies who ‘lovetheir servitude’ (Fig 294 [../Text/index_split_161.html#filepos1199715]). The‘GWEN’ system in the United States and the ‘TETRA’ system in the United Kingdomand other countries are also part of this. The communication towers of theGround Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) have been appearing all over the UnitedStates since the early 1980s under the direction of the US Air Force. GWEN is anetwork of towers hundreds of feet high and placed 200 miles apart. The coverstory is that GWEN is an emergency back-up communication system in the event ofa nuclear war. Rubbish. They are part of the planned global mind-control‘bubble’ to disconnect us even more from the wider reality. GWEN towers transmitfrequencies that don’t radiate into the atmosphere, but hug and penetrate theground to ensure that no-one can escape what they are sending out. GWENcommunications are planned to communicate with implanted human microchips.Millions of Americans already live within the electromagnetic waves of GWEN, andbefore long it will be everyone. It is well-known that people are much easier tomind-control when they are subjected to technologically-generatedelectromagnetic fields. Robert O Becker, twice nominated for a Nobel Prize forhis expertise on the biological effects of electromagnetism, wrote:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00368.jpg] Figure 294: HAARP, Smart Grids, lightbulb transmitters, and telecommunicationsantennae and technology (including cell phone receiver–transmitters) are allpart of a vast global mind-control network > GWEN is a superb system, in combination with cyclotron resonance, for> producing behavioural alterations in the civilian population. The average> strength of the steady geomagnetic field varies from place to place across the> United States. Therefore, if one wished to resonate a specific ion in living> things in a specific locality, one would require a specific frequency for that> location. The spacing of GWEN transmitters 200 miles apart across the United> States would allow such specific frequencies to be ‘tailored’ to the> geomagnetic-field strength in each GWEN area. It’s all carefully planned. GWEN also has the potential to manipulate theweather. In Britain, we have Terrestrial Trunked Radio, or TETRA. The coverstory is that TETRA is just a new communications system for the police and otheremergency services. The system was introduced when there was no need on theorders of the then Prime Minister, ‘shapeshifter’ Tony Blair, and the realreason for TETRA is mass mind-control. TETRA technology is similar to thePCS/Digital, or Personal Communication Systems, used in the United States. TheBritish Home Office awarded the contract for TETRA to a consortium headed byBritish Telecom and it was sold on to 02 and their subsidiary mm02. Motorola,the American telecommunications giant, is also involved in making an importantcomponent of the TETRA system, and this is a company with close links to theNational Security Agency (NSA). An internal European Union document revealedthat Motorola played a crucial role in defining the TETRA European standard (incollaboration with the National Security Agency) in order to guarantee for theUS government the potential for TETRA networks to be eavesdropped. But it isabout more than that. They want all of these technologies to be able to connectas one global network. TETRA, once again, communicates on frequencies that matchhuman brain activity. It is the same story that you find everywhere, becausethey are all introduced for the same reason – the control of the human mind andemotions. People living near TETRA and GWEN masts have complained of illness,headaches, depression and all the usual consequences associated with thesetechnologies.Another potential for HAARP is amplification of poisons and chemicals in thebody from relatively harmless to downright lethal. A process called ‘cyclotronresonance’ means that electromagnetic influence can increase the strength ofchemical substances by up to a thousand times. The chemicals in food that arecumulatively harmful could be ‘excited’ by electromagnetic fields from HAARP, orother sources, to become deadly poisons. HAARP, and related technology, candisturb the body’s circadian rhythm, the daily cycle ‘in the physiologicalprocesses of living beings, including plants, animals, fungi and cyanobacteria’.They dictate sleep and eating patterns in humans and animals, and affect brainwave activity, hormone production, cell regeneration and other biologicalactivities. Jet lag is a disturbance of the circadian rhythm, and one of thecauses is the effect of electromagnetic radiation at high altitudes. There areso many consequences when you start messing with electromagnetic fields,especially within the range of human brain activity and the natural energeticbalance of the planet. We are seeing the Reptilian obsession with technologythat I have been talking about, and we need to urgently to address what ishappening before it’s too late. The Large Hadron Collider built by the EuropeanOrganisation for Nuclear Research, or CERN, is connected to the global web ofEarth and reality manipulation that includes HAARP. This is the world’s largestand highest-energy particle accelerator and consists of a 17-mile tunnel loopbeneath the Swiss–French border. It is described as an ‘atom smasher’ thatcollides particles, and it contains more than 1,000 cylindrical magnets arrangedend-to-end. The collider began operations in 2008 and has been breaking recordsfor smacking particles together, but it is not expected to reach full capacityuntil 2014. The project has involved 10,000 scientists from around the world,but the United States (the Rothschilds) has made the dominant contribution.CERN’s official motive for the money-no-object collider that cost billions is tofind out what happened at the time of the Big Bang (there wasn’t one – time togo home chaps) and to understand the deepest laws of nature; but that’s only thecover story. CERN says that it plans to create and accelerate beams of particlesof up to seven trillion volts, and the potential impact of that is obvious.There are other colliders around the world, too, which we know nothing about.CERN is, like HAARP, another international project, but officially so this time.Twenty member countries are involved, and CERN employs thousands of scientistsfrom 113 nationalities and more than 600 universities. The World Wide Webemerged from research at CERN. Israeli scientists have made a major contributionto CERN and the Large Hadron Collider. This was acknowledged by Israel’s Scienceand Technology Minister, Professor Daniel Hershkowitz. He said: ‘Israel’sscience has received additional international recognition for our leadingcontribution to research in general and specifically the CERN project.’Something very big is going on there and it is nothing to do with the ‘BigBang’. Nor is it good for humanity."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00369.jpg] It is no good talking around the fact, because it is happening. The Reptilianhybrid bloodlines are in the midst of a mega depopulation programme in whichthey want to reduce the human population by billions. Some of theirrepresentatives talk of a global population of one billion, even half a billion,and HAARP is one of their major weapons in achieving this.Human numbers have got out of hand from the Control System’s point of view, andthey want to reduce the population to a figure that is more easily controllablein their ‘Brave New World’. John P Holdren, the ‘science czar’ appointed to theObama administration, is one of these ‘cullers’. He says that the optimum humanpopulation is one billion and he has some interesting ways to bring this about.Holdren is the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology whoco-wrote a book in 1977 called Ecoscience, which details proposals tomass-sterilise the population by medicating food and the water supply andimposing a regime of forced abortion, government seizure of children born out ofwedlock and mandatory bodily implants to stop pregnancy. The book supports apolicy of allowing only two children per family, with those that have morelosing any right to public housing. Only the two children would qualify forpublic education, and the parents of any others would have to pay separately fortheir education. People would have to secure a ‘birth licence’ before they hadchildren. These people are beyond crazy, but they currently control the globalpower structure. Holdren wants to see a ‘planetary regime’ (world government,here we go) that would dictate the detail of everyone’s life in a ‘globalcommons’. This ‘regime’ would have total control of anything that affects theair, soil or seas, and would decide what car you drove, the temperature in yourhome (via Smart Grids) and, through control of the land, who grew food and whodidn’t. The bloodlines want their corporations to produce all the food witheveryone else banned from doing so. Holdren also calls for a ‘science court’that would decree what technology could be used and what could not. He wroteEcoscience with the population-control extremists, Paul and Anne Ehrlich. Spermcounts have dropped by a third since 1989 and by half in 50 years. The policy ofsterilisation has long been happening. They are also implementing the cullthrough food and drink additives; blocking access to other forms of nutrition;vaccinations and drugs; laboratory-created diseases; endless and growing formsof radiation; poisons and metals poured into the sky all over the world fromaircraft and known as ‘chemtrails’ (which I will come to shortly); wars; hungerand famine; denying medical treatment to the elderly; the list goes on and on.Most of these effects are cumulative rather than instantly lethal – at least fornow – and they are targeting the human immune system to debilitate the body’sdefences while this is happening. The consequences for people, especially theyoung, from the cumulative radiation they are absorbing from mobile phones aregoing to be catastrophic. Please, don’t put them to your ear unless absolutelynecessary and then for as little time as possible. Text or use email until youcan talk on a landline. I explain the depopulation programme and the effects ofall these multiple attacks on human health in great detail in Human Race Get OffYour Knees.THE RADIATION AGENDAWe are being subjected to ever more sources of radiation as part of thepopulation cull. There are many ways they do this, and I have been ticking themoff one by one as they have been introduced over the years (Fig 295[../Text/index_split_163.html#filepos1216470]). They include mobile phones andtheir communication masts, and an explosion of other technologies including:HAARP, GWEN and TETRA; computers; power lines (hence the increase in cancercases for people living near them and why the number of power lines is beingmassively increased); full-body scanners in airports (frequent fliers who don’topt out are going to be seriously affected eventually); wireless Internet;ridiculous overuse of X-rays and CAT scanners in hospitals; irradiated food; thenew ‘green’ lightbulbs; microwave ovens; nuclear power disasters; the depleteduranium in bombs dropped across the world that is leading to horrendous birthdefects (and this travels around the world from its target area); and there isthe cosmic radiation that would normally be deflected which is getting throughthe Earth’s defences because of HAARP punching holes into the ionosphere. WhileHAARP is scanning or X-raying the earth for resources it is doing the same topeople in that area; and goodness knows what satellites might be sending ourway. Certainly they have the ability to project scalar waves at locations andindividuals. Scalar waves can carry information and are not weakened by time ordistance. DNA generates and receives scalar waves in tune with its frequency sothe potential for physical, mental and emotional manipulation is obvious.Governments are lying about technologies being safe, so that they can expose usto as much radiation as possible. Documents released under the Freedom ofInformation Act revealed that Janet Napolitano, US Homeland Security Secretary,was lying when she said that full-body scanners had been proved to be safe bythe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). No they haven’t,because they’re not. How can you prove safety anyway when the effects arecumulative? An internal NIST email expressed concern at what Napolitano said andpointed out that the organisation does not test products and so cannot ‘provethem safe’. Napolitano isn’t bothered that she is subjecting Americans todangerous cumulative doses of radiation with the body scanners – she doesn’thave to use them. Other NIST correspondence said that the scanners may not besafe and that staff should avoid standing near them. Staff should avoid standingnear them, but passengers, including children who are most susceptible toradiation, should go through them. Another Napolitano lie (she has plenty wherethat came from) was that studies at the Johns Hopkins University Applied PhysicsLaboratory had said the scanners were safe, when Dr Michael Love, X-ray FacilityManager at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said that the machines weregoing to cause skin cancer. Dr David Brenner, who heads the Center forRadiological Research at Columbia University, agreed. He said: ‘There really isno other technology around where we’re planning to X-ray such an enormous numberof individuals. It’s really unprecedented in the radiation world.’ A study in2010 at Columbia University by the Inter-Agency Committee on Radiation Safetyrecommended that children and pregnant women should not be scanned, but nothinghas been done because they want to cull the population. Four professors at theUniversity of California in San Francisco – specialists in biochemistry,biophysics, X-ray imaging and cancer – wrote to Obama’s Science Advisor, JohnHoldren, to warn that there was still ‘no rigorous, hard data for the safety ofX-ray airport passenger scanners’ and that safety tests were being conductedexclusively by manufacturers. They were wasting their time. Why would anextremist people-culler like Holdren do anything about technology that iskilling people? Remember also that the scanners were promoted by former head ofHomeland Security, Michael Chertoff (Rothschild Zionist), after a fake ‘terrorattack’ – the ‘underpants bomber’ who was allowed onto his plane in Amsterdam bya Rothschild Zionist security operation. Chertoff’s company represents Rapiscan,which has a contract worth $173 million to provide body scanners. The dangersposed by the scanners are painfully obvious for anyone with a brain on activeduty, and now the obvious has happened. The Transportation SecurityAdministration (TSA) has been exposed trying to cover up a surge in cancer amongairport security staff that work with the machines. Documents secured by theElectronic Privacy Information Center under the Freedom of Information Actreveal that ‘a large number of workers have been falling victim to cancer,strokes and heart disease’. The documents especially highlighted Boston LoganAirport where TSA officials refused to provide the means to measure radiationlevels even after a ‘cancer cluster’ emerged among staff working the machines.When will people in uniform learn that the State doesn’t give a damn about themany more than it does for the rest of the population? Another scam devised withthe intention of irradiating large numbers of people is the introduction of newairport security-scanners announced in 2011. The sequence goes like this: makethe security procedure at airports such a horrible experience that people willbe open to anything that would make it quicker and easier; then roll out new21-foot-long tunnels that passengers just walk through with their bag while bothpassengers and baggage are scanned as they go. Ain’t that great? What time itwill save. But there is the one little snag. As you walk the 21 feet, you willbe dosed with radiation which will include the stuff that only the bag used toget. They want to subject us to the maximum sources and doses of radiation theycan get away with."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00370.jpg] Figure 295: The sources of radiation pollution are increasing all the time –exactly as planned Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) ROTHSCHILD WHEREVER YOU LOOKI learned in the early 1990s that the House of Rothschild was the force behindthe introduction of nuclear power from Dr Kitty Little who worked for nine yearsat the UK’s Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. If the Rothschildsare involved in anything, the motivation is always to advance the ‘Great Work ofthe Ages’ – the highjack of Planet Earth. Nuclear power was not motivated by theneed for energy, but the need, from the bloodlines’ point of view, to releaseradiation into the atmosphere. This was motivated by the desire for massdepopulation and because it seems that the Reptilians feed off radiation. Humanshave serious consequences from radiation because it distorts our particularelectromagnetic fields, but if you are a different type of field that canharmonise with radiation then it can be a food source that will not harm you.The Reptilians, and to an extent their hybrids, are not troubled by radiation inthe same way that we are. The disaster at the nuclear facility at Fukushima inJapan continues to release fantastic amounts of radiation at the time ofwriting, which is circulating around the world. It is already vastly in excessof what was released by the nuclear plant at Chernobyl in the Ukraine in 1986 –some experts say 50 times more by June 2011. I said earlier that Fukushima wasstruck by a nuclear device placed by a Rothschild Zionist ‘security’ companybased at Dimona, the location of the Israeli nuclear programme. This caused theplanned catastrophic release of radiation worldwide, but particularly aroundJapan and across to the United States. The number of babies dying in the UnitedStates has long since been ridiculously high for a developed country, but thefigures shot up in Northern California in the period that the Fukushimaradiation was reaching that region. This happened to unborn and newborn babiesand animals in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. Other nuclear power stations,such as Sellafield in the north west of England, have been pouring radiationinto the sea or rivers for decades. The seas are incredibly polluted by now, andso is much of the rain and snow. Fukushima is taking it all to another level.Remember that water absorbs information. Radiation in this reality is distortedinformation, and this does the same to the information blueprint of the planet,and pollutes with rogue information – like a computer virus – the Earth’s energyfield that we operate within. The same applies to the oil systematicallyreleased into the Gulf of Mexico by the Rothschild-controlled BP, and othersources of water pollution, including fluoride in the water that people drink.I described earlier how HAARP was employed to generate the record volumes ofwater into the Missouri and Mississippi rivers in 2011 to inundate land whichthe Army Corps of Engineers were offering to buy from farmers who losteverything, while the same Army Corps of Engineers blew up levees. But there wasanother aspect to this and, again, it was radiation. The Missouri Riverinundated the Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant in eastern Nebraska which holdsan immense amount of nuclear fuel. There was an electrical fire in the basementand the plant had to be evacuated. Toxic gases made part of the plantinaccessible, and then the waters of the Missouri River flooded the basement. Ano-fly zone over the plant was instigated (as it was over the oil slick in theGulf of Mexico) because of ‘security reasons that we can’t reveal’. The FortCooper nuclear power plant, also in Nebraska, was similarly under threat at thesame time. The Fort Calhoun plant was built in a flood plain of the MissouriRiver. The Fukushima complex was located in an earthquake zone and on the coastwhere it was vulnerable to tsunamis. Nuclear power plants in California arebuilt on earthquake fault lines, and the Indian Point nuclear power plant nearNew York was placed over a small earthquake fault zone on the east bank of theHudson River. A presenter on Russia Today (RT) Television asked why theauthorities would be so crazy. Well, yes, they are crazy – beyond insane – butit is not that they were crazy for doing this through incompetence andstupidity; they are crazy because they did this on purpose. A script writtenlong ago is playing out. In 2011, a forest fire threatened the Los AlamosNational Laboratories (LANL) in New Mexico, home of Oppenheimer’s ManhattanProject, and the organisation Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety reportedthat over 30,000 barrels of plutonium-contaminated waste were being stored abovethe ground in little more than tents. It was also revealed that approximately 18million cubic feet of radioactive and chemical solid wastes were just buried ordumped in the area around Los Alamos since 1943. The Alliance for NuclearAccountability said: ‘All of the radioactive waste and most of the chemicalwaste have been buried on the mesas of Pajarito Plateau where LANL is located.Radioactive liquid wastes were discharged to the canyons, initially with littletreatment.’ The same theme can be seen with the 15 nuclear reactors and the mazeof oil and gas pipelines that criss-cross the New Madrid earthquake fault-linein the Southern and Midwestern United States. This has been the scene of four ofAmerica’s biggest earthquakes. Steve Geller, a Florida state Democrat leader,said: ‘Virtually every natural gas pipeline in the nation is built over thatfault …You’ll see the explosion reflected off the moon.’ Ed Gray, of theMissouri State Emergency Management Agency, agreed that the concentration ofpipelines across a fault-line was asking for trouble (they are): > You have four of the five major natural-gas pipelines come right through the> soup in New Madrid, the soft alluvial soil. They carry gas all the way to> Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis and Pittsburgh. If [the earthquake] happened> during the winter, you’re going to have major-league problems on your hands.> Try to explain to somebody why you cannot heat a nursing home or keep a> hospital warm. The organisation responsible for nuclear safety in America is the US NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC); but an investigation by The Associated Pressrevealed in 2011 that the NRC is ignoring or weakening the rules which it issupposed to be enforcing. The Associated Press discovered in a year-longinvestigation that a ten-gallon-a-minute leak at the now-closed Indian Pointnuclear power plant, little more than 30 miles north of New York City, has beenignored for nearly four years. Indian Point has been leaking lethal radioactiveelements into the Hudson River. The amount of radiation allowed to leak (allowedto leak?) from faulty valves at nuclear facilities is now 20 times what it usedto be. The Washington Post reported that radioactive tritium has leaked from atleast 48 of 65 sites of commercial nuclear power sites in the United States,according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission records. At least 37 of thosefacilities contained tritium concentrations which sometimes exceeded the federaldrinking-water standard by hundreds of times. A nuclear facility in New Jerseyleaked tritium into an aquifer and a discharge canal feeding Barnegat Bay offthe Atlantic Ocean, and there have been numerous reports of tritium leaks intothe surface waters across the US over the past years. Tritium moves quicklythrough soil, and when detected it often indicates the presence of more powerfulradioactive isotopes that are spilled at the same time. One of the reasons forthis is that less stringent tests have been implemented to allow operators topass inspections. The Associated Press discovered failing cables, crackedconcrete, rusting underground pipes, and in one case a hole five inches squarecut into a reactor vessel at the Davis–Besse plant in Ohio. But the facilitiescontinued to be licensed to operate. Regulation was dismantled to allow thebanking crisis of 2008, and regulation is now being weakened to release moreradiation into the atmosphere. A State review of Russian nuclear sites in thewake of Fukushima was leaked to The Associated Press and revealed more than 30serious faults in the system, including reduced safety standards and noeffective strategy for securing radioactive fuel and waste at many plants. Youwill find the same story in every country that has nuclear power – and this isby design. But amid all this, with every nuclear power station a potentialnuclear bomb and country-destroyer, the British government announced that is wasgoing ahead with an enormous expansion of nuclear power with eight new reactors.‘It can’t happen here,’ was the reply when a spokesman was asked about thedangers of nuclear plants. They know this for sure, because they have had a‘risk assessment’. Phew, thank goodness for that. They are liars; they lie for aliving. Emails revealed that the British government and nuclear power industrywere colluding to play down the dangers of Fukushima even before anyone knew theamount of radiation that was being released. London’s The Guardian reported thatinternal emails confirmed that the government was working closely behind thescenes with transnational corporations, Westinghouse, EDF Energy and Areva tostop the Fukushima disaster affecting the expansion of nuclear power in Britainwhich they announced soon afterwards. An official at the Department forBusiness, Innovation and Skills said of Fukushima in one email: > This has the potential to set the nuclear industry back globally. We need to> ensure the anti-nuclear chaps and chapesses do not gain ground on this. We> need to occupy the territory and hold it. We really need to show the safety of> nuclear. Here is some advice about government statements anywhere in the world: don’tbelieve a word they say until it is proven beyond doubt. These people are paidto lie, and mendacity is encoded in their very DNA. The plan for Britain’sexpansion of nuclear power was announced by the idiot (or worse) Energy andClimate Change Secretary, Chris Huhne. He is a global-warming extremist and saysthat nuclear power will ‘reduce carbon emissions’ (which are not changing theclimate). If anything is messing with the climate, it is HAARP. When thegovernment presses on with a policy against all logic and evidence, it isfollowing the Illuminati script which does not take no for an answer. Huhneeither knows this and he supports the script, or he is indeed an idiot. Huhnehas likened those who challenge climate-change orthodoxy (lies) to those whoappeased Hitler and the Nazis. ‘This is our Munich moment,’ he said. Prat.LETHAL LIGHTINGThe radiation agenda and mind control are the real reasons why, despite thelong-since demolished credibility of human-caused ‘climate change’, laws arebeing introduced to force ‘climate friendly’ lightbulbs upon us and to ban thealternative. This has happened in Britain and across Europe, thanks to theEuropean Union, and is planned for North America thanks to the same globalnetwork. These so-called compact fluorescent lightbulbs, or ‘CFLs’, are supposedto be good for ‘fighting’ (everything is a’fight’) the illusory global warming –good for the ‘environment’ in other words. In fact, they are seriously dangerousto both human and animal health. I outlined earlier how the bulbs areinformation transmitters, but there are many other ‘benefits’ from thebloodlines’ point of view. The bulbs contain mercury (also called quicksilver)which is lethally toxic. Mercury is so dangerous – especially for children andthe unborn – that it has been banned in many countries for use in a long list ofdevices, including thermometers, vehicle and thermostat switches. They did thisbecause the use of mercury was considered extremely unsafe. Mercury is even moretoxic than arsenic and lead (a sobering thought when you think that amalgamtooth fillings are made with mercury). But here they are insisting by law thatwe have lights in our homes, workplaces, shops and malls that will releasemercury into the atmosphere whenever they are broken. Every single bulb is adisaster waiting to happen, and this is not being done through the stupidity andincompetence of those who have orchestrated this policy from the shadows.Bureaucratic ‘stupidity’ and ‘incompetence’ are often the cover for coldcalculation. Fluorescent bulbs are said to use less electricity and last muchlonger than conventional ones, but if bulbs are frequently switched on and off(they are lights for goodness sake, and I thought turning them off saved energy)then they wear out rapidly and in some circumstances faster than the bulbs theyare forcibly replacing. What happens if one of the normal lightbulbs (called‘incandescent’) breaks into pieces, as they sometimes do? We sweep up the bitsand throw them in the bin, job done, no problem. What do we have to do when an‘environmentally-friendly’, help-to-save-the-world fluorescent bulb breaks? Hereis some helpful advice from the UK Health Protection Agency: > (1) Keep children and pets out of the contaminated area.> (2) Prior to cleaning up the spill, put on an old set of clothes and shoes,> and rubber gloves.> (3) Never vacuum the affected area as this will contaminate the machine and> result in the airborne release of vaporised mercury. A vacuum cleaner> contaminated with mercury will have to be disposed of. Consult your local> authority for information on where you can safely dispose of such equipment,> or if you have any queries. A mop or broom should not be used as these will> become contaminated and spread the spill.> (4) Elemental mercury that has been spilt on a hard surface should be picked> up using masking tape, or swept into a glass container with a sealable lid> using stiff cardboard to push the beads together. Check a wide area beyond the> spill, using a torch to identify as much of the mercury as possible.> (5) The container, the cardboard and brokenglass should be double- bagged for> disposal. Then consult your local authority for information regarding disposal> facilities, or if you have any queries. The room in which the spill occurred> should be ventilated and the spill area should not be vacuumed for two weeks.> (6) If the spill is on upholstery or carpet, the mercury should be collected> in a sealable container (see step 4). Remember, never vacuum the affected area> as this will contaminate the machine and result in the airborne release of> vaporised mercury which can harm health. If the mercury cannot be retrieved,> the area of contaminated upholstery or carpet may need to be removed and> disposed of as hazardous waste. If this is the case, the contaminated material> should be double-bagged. Consult your local authority for information on where> you can safely dispose of the waste.> (7) Do not use household cleaning products to clean the spill, particularly> products that contain ammonia or chlorine such as bleach. These chemicals will> react violently with mercury, releasing a toxic gas.> (8) Elemental mercury that has been spilt down a sink should be removed by> dismantling the U-bend (water trap) and collected in a sealable container and> disposed as hazardous waste. Mercury left in the sink U-bend will vaporise on> contact with warm water and should therefore be removed to avoid prolonged> exposure.> (9) Clothing that has come into contact with the mercury must not be> dry-cleaned or washed in a washing machine and must be discarded,> double-bagged, in the normal household refuse.> (10) Carefully remove rubber gloves by grabbing them at the wrist and pulling> them inside out as they come off. Place the gloves and any contaminated> clothing, double-bagged, in the rubbish bin for disposal.The Health Protection Agency adds that we must ‘remember to keep the areawell-ventilated to the outside (open windows and run any available fans) for atleast twenty-four hours after your successful clean-up. Continue to keep petsand children out of the clean-up area’. The agency then talks about disposing ofthe bulbs at the hazardous household waste section of a waste recycling-centre.Have you got all that when your next fluorescent lightbulb breaks? And there isjust the little matter that there are an estimated 5.5 million lightbulbs boughtin the United States alone every day in a country that uses at any one time somefour billion. And every time one breaks you are into the procedure outlinedabove; and even if they don’t break they must be disposed of as hazardous waste.The Ellsworth American newspaper reported how a lady called Brandy Bridges fromProspect, Maine, followed the official guidance and replaced the bulbs in herhome with the fluorescent variety. But then one of them broke and what followeddevastated her home and life. The bulb broke in her daughter’s bedroom and shecalled the Home Depot store to ask for advice. She was advised to call a PoisonControl hotline where they passed her on to the Maine Department ofEnvironmental Protection. They deployed a specialist to the scene whoestablished that mercury levels in the bedroom were six times the State’s ‘safe’limit (and who decides that?) for mercury contamination, and she was told sheshould engage a clean-up company to decontaminate the room. The bill to do this:$2,000. This is just one fluorescent lightbulb in one home when eventually therewill be some four billion in the United States alone. Given the fantastic scaleof bulbs needing to be disposed of we are going to see – are seeing – seriousmercury contamination in garbage and landfill sites. They shouldn’t be disposedof like this, but that is what vast numbers of people will do rather than takethem to hazardous waste centres. The Control System knows this will happen.Already an estimated 80 million used fluorescent tubes are sent to landfillsites in the UK every year, according to the waste education organisation,WasteAware. This equates to four tonnes of mercury, and the figure throughoutEurope and North America is going to be mind-blowing. This puts collectors ofrefuse at risk from any broken bulbs disposed of in household waste, and alsoendangers neighbours in communal situations. Those dumped in landfills on thescale that is going to be seen have the clear potential to pollute ground watersupplies, rivers and fish with cumulative and lethal mercury contamination. Itis said that just one compact fluorescent bulb can pollute 6,000 gallons ofwater beyond safe drinking levels. Once again, this is by design. The plan is tomass-poison humans from endless sources as part of the global cull of thepopulation and also to suppress us mentally through chemical influence. Theeffects of mercury include dementia, such as Alzheimer’s, depression, loss ofmemory, inability to control muscles and movements (known as ‘motor function’),kidney failure and many other health problems. This is why the bloodlines wantus to be poisoned by mercury (hence amalgam teeth fillings). You might note thatthe words fluoride and fluorescent are similar. This is because they have acommon ‘ancestor’ – a highly dangerous element called Fluorine (also calledFluorspar), which is derived from the mineral fluorite (from the Latin rootfluo, meaning ‘to flow’)."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00371.jpg] Figure 296: Lightbulb fascism Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00372.jpg] Figure 297: ‘Green’ lightbulbs transmit toxic chemicals and radiation as amatter of course; and, when they break, they release lethal mercury Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) There are several important aspects to the imposition of fluorescent lightingand these include the vibrational, chemical and radiation effects on humanhealth (Fig 296 [../Text/index_split_164.html#filepos1239178]). The bulbs aremade to emit a disharmonious vibration, radiation and toxic chemicals with somepeople more affected than others (Fig 297). Most of the photons released fromthe mercury atoms are in ultraviolet (UV) radiation wavelengths and there areincreasing reports of people becoming ill or having a bright red rash appear ontheir face after they use them (Fig 298[../Text/index_split_166.html#filepos1241996]). UV light can affect and fadesensitive paintings, especially watercolours, and many textiles. So using thesebulbs requires artwork to be protected with acrylic sheets, according to somereports. Fluorescent lamps flicker, causing problems for people who aresensitive to this, and the less sensitive are affected in ways that are not soobvious. The flicker has the potential for disrupting photography and videorecording. The significance of the vibrational impact can be seen with theability of these lights to cause televisions to take on a life of their own,switching channels by affecting the infra-red sensors on remote-controlreceivers. Philips Electronics has confirmed this phenomenon. We are vibrationalbeings and we are affected by other vibrational influences that can causemental, emotional and physical dis-ease – disharmony. These are some of thehealth problems being reported by people after using fluorescent bulbs, ascompiled at www.renewableenergygeek.ca [http://www.renewableenergygeek.ca]:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00373.jpg] Figure 298: The shocking effects of ‘green’ lightbulbs on this woman’s face > Mild to severe headaches (migraines); skin irritation, redness, burning> sensations, and/or itchiness; dizziness and nausea; tinnitus (ringing in the> ears) and earaches; numbness and tingling sensations; tired, weak and> fatigued; difficulty sleeping / restlessness; chest pains / heart problems;> poor memory and concentration; irritability; feelings of stress and anxiety;> depression and mood swings; difficulty breathing; muscle and joint pain; and> pain and pressure in the eyes. These are the multiple consequences of exposure to what is called ‘DirtyElectricity’ – imbalanced electromagnetic fields that disrupt theelectromagnetic balance of the body and the electrical circuits of the brain.Even the utterly useless Health Canada, which has been covering up most of thehealth effects to avoid contradicting government policy, has said: ‘… the CFLsare not provided with a prismatic diffuser that filters ultraviolet radiationout. Therefore, there may be skin sensitive issues, especially in people withcertain skin diseases’. Dermatologist Dr John Hawk told the BBC that some peoplealready find it difficult to tolerate the fluorescent strip-lighting widely usedin schools and offices which operates the same way as CFL bulbs. Hawk said: > Fluorescent lights seem to have some sort of ionising characteristic where> they affect the air around them.

Ah, but they are not able to ‘just be around incandescent lighting’ because thathas been banned in increasing numbers of countries and these health-destroyersimposed by law. Some people say that fluorescent lights should carry a warningabout their potential health effects, but, once again, what is the use of awarning if you have to use them or else sit in the dark? So take a deep breathas we sum up the consequences of forcing the population to use theselife-threatening lighting systems: They are potentially deadly when they breakand mercury is released, especially for children and foetuses; the mercurycontent can have a catastrophic effect on brain and body function; they have tobe disposed of – billions of them – as hazardous waste and when they are dumpedin the trash or at landfill sites this creates a highly toxic environment thatseeps mercury into underground water supplies and rivers; the vibration,radiation and chemical effects trigger serious and potentially fatal healthproblems, so much so that scientists have warned people, especially children, to‘stay at a distance’ and ‘avoid being in contact with them for more than anhour’; they fade pictures and textiles and affect television and othertransmissions. From any perspective of rational thought, the very idea ofintroducing this blatant nightmare to replace something that has worked for solong is beyond insanity. Well, any rational perspective if you care in any waywhatsoever about human wellbeing, that is. The people passing laws to imposethese lights are largely just the puppet-fodder repeaters who will simply repeatthe party line they have been programmed to believe about both the problem(‘global warming’) and the solution (‘low-energy lightbulbs’). They areunthinking, unresearching psyches-for-hire with little that could be seriouslyidentified as approaching the definition of ‘intelligence’; but in the shadows,behind the mindless dark suits, they know exactly what they are doing. Onceagain, humans overwhelmingly just sit back and take it; but then acquiescencecan be transmitted, too.SPRAYING THE SKIESMany people all over the world will have noticed a strange and now common sightin their skies that involves aircraft flying to and fro, often in criss-crosspatterns, and pouring out what have become known as ‘chemtrails’ (Figs 299 and300 [../Text/index_split_167.html#filepos1250786]). These are not the same ascontrails, or condensation trails, that we see trailing behind aircraft.Contrails disperse almost immediately; but chemtrails don’t. They expand tocover the sky with their chemical and metallic cocktails. This is anothervehicle for global depopulation. Chemtrail spraying appears to have started inthe late 1990s in North America, and now I see it almost wherever I go in theworld. Researcher William Thomas was on the case soon after spraying began inCanada in 1998. He says that analysis of the chemtrails has identified highlytoxic pathogens, including Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain). Dr GarthNicholson from the Institute of Molecular Medicine in California found this insome 45 per cent of former US troops suffering from the debilitating diseasecalled Gulf War Syndrome (Hey, guys in uniform – they don’t give a shit aboutyou). People have reported suffering from respiratory and flu-like conditionsand sometimes mental confusion and depression after chemtrail spraying in thesky. The trails also contain aluminium and barium. This is toxic to humans andsuppresses the immune system by deactivating T-cell receptors and stopping themfrom resisting disease. In September 2000, a document produced by the ‘neocon’(Rothschild Zionist) Project for the New American Century called for thedevelopment of ‘advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specificgenotypes …’ How about if they have concocted biological weapons that do notaffect their hybrid ‘genotype’? They are poisoning the rest of the globalpopulation from the skies. A new and horrible disease was discovered soon afterthe chemtrail spraying began, called ‘Morgellons disease’ (Fig 301[../Text/index_split_168.html#filepos1251055]). The symptoms are crawling,stinging and biting sensations of the skin; skin lesions that will not heal;extreme fatigue; severe mental confusion; short-term memory loss; joint pain; asharp decline in vision; itching so bad that some victims consider suicide; andserious neurological disorders. The most shocking aspect of Morgellons diseaseis the coloured fibres that can be pulled from the body, and not even this stopstheir continued growth (Fig 302 [../Text/index_split_169.html#filepos1251343]).I have no doubt that the fibres emerge from nanotechnology in the chemtrailswhich eventually come down to infect land and crops and water, and to bebreathed in and absorbed through the skin by humans. Nanotechnology is far toosmall for the human eye to see. Chemtrails are part of the mass depopulationprogramme that is gathering by the day. Biological warfare against the people isnot new, but the global scale of it certainly is and it comes courtesy of BigBiotech and the usual suspects. China is also involved in this programme of masspoisoning, because, once again, different ‘sides’ are only illusory. Put‘chemtrails’ into a search engine or YouTube and you will find reams ofinformation and videos on this subject. While you are at it, type in the words‘500,000 plastic coffins in Georgia’ and ask yourself why there are half amillion plastic coffins in one location in Georgia alone with other examplesaround America.image [../Images/00374.jpg] Figure 299: Toxic chemtrails are being released all over the world "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00375.jpg] Figure 300: "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00376.jpg] Figure 301: Morgellons disease "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00377.jpg] Figure 302: Morgellons disease involves programmed nanotechnology Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) AGENDA 21The theme of ‘saving the planet’, promoted by those who have been destroying theplanet, is not confined only to ‘global warming’ or ‘climate change’. Oh no, itgoes much further than that. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, or ratherdon’t, ‘Agenda 21’ (Fig 303 [../Text/index_split_170.html#filepos1255215]). Thiswas birthed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development inRio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. The event was hosted by Maurice Strong, aCanadian oil and business billionaire who has slavishly served the interests ofthe Rothschilds and Rockefellers for most of his life. Strong is a member of theClub of Rome, the environmental satellite in the Round Table network whichincludes the Bilderberg Group and Trilateral Commission. The Biodiversity Treatyconnected to Agenda 21 is an internationally-binding treaty that involves thebest part of 200 countries. Agenda 21 demands, under the guise of ‘saving theenvironment’, widespread land confiscation by the United Nations, and governmentcontrol of all resources, water supplies and usage, and so much more. The UnitedStates signed the treaty, but it was not ratified by the Senate thanks to peoplelike ecologist and ecosystem scientist, Dr Michael Coffman. He realised in thecourse of his work in the 1980s and 1990s that there was a plan to confiscatehalf of America’s land to ‘protect the environment’. This includes removing roadlinks to destroy rural communities and drive residents out in the same way thatpeople alongside the technologically-flooded Missouri and Mississippi are beingdriven out. I have listed the countries fully-committed to this outrage inAppendix II [../Text/index_split_226.html#filepos1630939]. Needless to say theseinclude the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the EuropeanUnion. Agenda 21 is ‘a comprehensive blueprint of action to be taken globally,nationally and locally by organizations of the UN, governments, and major groupsin every area in which humans directly affect the environment’. Hold on, I’lljust pass that across my Orwellian Translation Unit … back in a sec … ‘Okay,thank you, bye.’ Right, this apparently means that Agenda 21 is about massdepopulation, stealing much of the Earth’s surface in the name of protecting it,and imposing a fascist control-structure at all levels that would make humansnothing more than fully-fledged microchipped serfs and slaves. We are asked tobelieve that the bloodline environmental assassins have been walking in thedirection of Damascus. Quite a relevant question I think: Why would the world’sbiggest polluters who are punching holes in the ionosphere, introducing multiplesources of radiation into the seas and atmosphere, destroying rainforests,devastating the ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico etc., etc., suddenly morph intotree-huggers? To state the obvious: They haven’t. Agenda 21 is the work of thebloodline created-and-controlled United Nations and it lays out in 40 chapters aprogramme to hijack the world. The goals include:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00378.jpg] Figure 303: Agenda 21 is indeed a Trojan horse to global fascism • An end to national sovereignty • State planning and management of all land resources, ecosystems, deserts,forests, mountains, oceans and fresh water; agriculture; rural development;biotechnology; and ensuring equity (everyone equally enslaved) • The State to ‘define the role’ of business and financial resources • Abolition of private property (it’s not ‘sustainable’) • ‘Restructuring’ the family unit • Children raised by the State • People told what their job will be • Major restrictions on movement • Creation of ‘human settlement zones’ • Mass resettlement as people are forced to vacate land where they live • Dumbing down education (achieved) • Mass depopulationAll this is planned to happen globally, nationally and locally across the world.Now wait a second. ‘Children raised by the State?’ Isn’t that what Aldous Huxleysaid in Brave New World in 1932? I think it is, you know. You can see in Figure304 [../Text/index_split_171.html#filepos1260120] a map of the America thatthese insane Agenda 21 ‘biodiversity’ and ‘sustainable development’ people wantto see. The darkest areas are designated for virtually no use by humans, and thenext darkest areas would be ‘highly regulated’. Only the areas one step lighterwould be for ‘normal use’ by the general population which would be concentratedin those ‘human settlement zones’, with most people packed and stacked togetherin high-rise buildings. This structure operating at global, regional, nationaland local levels would be overseen by a world government imposing its iron fistupon ‘global citizens’ and the ‘global village’. There would be no freedom ofspeech, free movement, or even – through technology – free thought. Harvey Rubin(Rothschild Zionist), a vice chairman of the Agenda 21 front operation, theInternational Committee for Local Environmental Initiatives, was asked how hisBrave New World would affect liberties with regard to the US Constitution andBill of Rights, private property and freedom of speech. His reply was short:‘Individual rights must take a back-seat to the collective.’ Agenda 21 isplanned to introduce what is called a ‘Technocracy’ in which engineers,scientists, medical people and technical experts in general controldecision-making and laws with regard to their subject area. ‘Experts’ would makethe decisions based on their level of knowledge; but who decides howknowledgeable they are? The State. If the State decides that an idiot isknowledgeable (as they so often do already) then the idiot gets to call theshots. You may have noticed how many decisions are being made and lawsintroduced now by agencies rather than El-ected people. These arestepping-stones to what I am talking about. Zbigniew Brzezinski published a bookin 1970 called Between Two Ages: America’s Role in the Technetronic Era. He knewexactly what was planned. He wrote:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00379.jpg] Figure 304: It’s goodbye America if the Agenda 21 crazies get their way > The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled> society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by> traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous> surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files> containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files> will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities. One plan in this Technocracy is to replace money (that’s why they are destroyingthe current monetary system) with a ‘carbon currency’, or ‘energycertificates/credits’. People would be allocated only so many and they wouldhave to be used before their designated period expires. This way no-one wouldaccumulate savings (except the Elite). Everyone would be totally dependent onthe State and the technocrats and their high-technology (the Reptilians will behaving an orgasm at the very thought). All this talk about ‘carbon credits’ inrelation to ‘climate change’ is preparing people for this and the Smart Gridsare a key aspect of this whole deal, too. There is something called the VenusProject – highlighted in the Zeitgeist films and based in Florida – which ispromoting a society that looks far too much like Agenda 21 for my comfort. Itswebsite says: ‘The Venus Project presents a bold, new direction for humanitythat entails nothing less than the total redesign of our culture.’ Fine, butwhat kind of ‘redesign’? The Venus Project is headed by Jacque Fresco, a‘futurist’ and engineer who says that in his resource-based economy ‘the systemof financial influence and control will no longer exist’. No, but it has thepotential to take human control onto a whole new level with the El-ite fewcontrolling the technology and the unified system.A vast web of interconnected organisations, including government agencies,nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), think tanks, trusts, foundations,‘training’ (mind control) operations and ‘initiatives’ have been building theinfrastructure for what they call ‘the post-industrial, post-democratic’(Technetronic) society, while most of the global population have been occupiedwith sport, game shows, soaps, computer games, social networking and othermanufactured diversions, or have been desperately trying to pay the bills in theface of the economic challenges which the same crowd have engineered. TheInternational Committee for Local Environmental Initiatives is now called LocalGovernments for Sustainability and this is led by its president, KonradOtto-Zimmermann (Rothschild Zionist). The Agenda 21 Local Governments forSustainability claims to have more than 1,220 local government members in 70countries representing 569,885,000 people. But, of course, they don’t‘represent’ them at all. Those people don’t even know Agenda 21 exists, letalone what the implications are for themselves and their families. LocalGovernments for Sustainability is supported by a whole bloody dog’s breakfast ofbloodline fronts peddling ‘climate change’ and biodiversity. These include:United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG); Metropolis; World Economic Forum;United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); United Nations Human SettlementsProgramme (UN-Habitat); United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change;United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction; World Bank;Clinton Climate Initiative; Climate Group (Tony Blair); World Conservation Union(IUCN); Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership; Global FootprintNetwork; International Centre for Sustainable Cities; Earthquakes and MegacitiesInitiative; Stakeholder Forum. My god, if you had that lot round to dinner youwouldn’t need a sleeping pill, would you? These are just some of a whole globaltapestry of organisations working to the same end. The Rothschilds andRockefellers had Agenda 21 in mind when they proposed a ‘World ConservationBank’ (WCB), now operating under a different name, at the Fourth WorldWilderness Conference in Colorado in 1987. James Baker, US Treasury Secretaryand close associate of ‘shapeshifter’ Father George Bush, made a speech insupport of the World Conservation Bank that involved writing off some ThirdWorld debt in return for giving wilderness and ‘environmentally sensitive’ landsto the ‘bank’. The World Conservation Bank was nothing to do with helpingdesperate countries and everything to do with a land-grab for Agenda 21. GeorgeW Hunt, an accountant and investment consultant, was an official host of theWorld Wilderness Conference and he had been researching some of the ‘conspiracytheory’ information that was beginning to circulate. Hunt told Moneychangermagazine that the World Conservation Bank was designed as a world central bankto steal land while claiming that it was being done to reduce debt and ‘help theenvironment’. Two very familiar names also came up. George Hunt said: > … the banker Edmond de Rothschild was at the meeting for six days. Edmond de> Rothschild was personally conducting the monetary matters and creation of this> World Conservation Bank, in the company of Michael Sweatman of the Royal Bank> of Canada. Those two were like Siamese twins, and that’s why I say that it> appears they were running at least the money side of this conference and I> would say the conference was primarily to get money. Also, David Rockefeller> (of Chase Manhattan Bank) was there and gave a speech on Sunday … The scam is to transfer debts from the Third World countries to the WorldConservation Bank and, in return, those countries would hand over land. Anyother organisation that took over the WCB would inherit ownership of vast tractsof the Earth. A fact sheet published by the Secretariat of the WildernessConference said: > … plans for the WCB propose that it act as an intermediary between certain> developing countries and multilateral or private banks to transfer a specific> debt to the WCB, thus substituting an existing ‘doubtful debt’ in the bank’s> books for a new loan to the WCB. In return for having been relieved of its> debt obligation, the debtor country would transfer to the WCB natural resource> assets of ‘equivalent value’. George Hunt delivered a written protest to David Rockefeller via his bodyguard.Hunt says that he received a warning from Rockefeller’s office saying that he’dbetter stay out of politicking or he’d regret it. These are such nice people.The World Conservation Bank morphed into the ‘Global Environment Facility’ andthis is doing precisely what Rothschild and Rockefeller proposed – stealing theworld. Barack Obama created the White House Rural Council in 2011 simply bysigning an Executive Order with no discussion or debate (EO 13575). This ‘RuralCouncil’ includes a long list of government agencies, including the Departmentof Defense and NASA (on a Rural Council?), which are necessary to find reasonsto clear people from the land – do it physically if necessary – and implementAgenda 21. Obama’s Executive Order has been described as ‘the greatest threat toindependent and family farming and ranching’. Now you see how this connects intothe plan to give bloodline corporations a monopoly on the production of food andwhy levees were blown up by the Army Corps of Engineers to flood independentfarmland only for the stricken farmers to receive letters saying that they couldsell their land to … the Army Corps of Engineers. Obama’s Rural Council is, asone commentator put it, ‘a war council and one which has declared its intentionto mount an attack on property owners across the nation … to remove as many aspossible from valued agricultural lands across the country’; in short – Agenda21. Then, in July 2011, came news of another attack on family farms. It wasrevealed that ‘discussions’ were taking place at the US Department ofTransportation to require farmers to have a commercial driver’s license tooperate farming equipment. This would end family farming practices that go backas long as America. Family farms are just that – run by the family on often atight budget. Youngsters are brought up to operate tractors and prepare to takeover in the next generation. But the new rules would mean that they would haveto be replaced by expensive professional drivers that the farmers could notafford. This is more cold calculation to make life impossible for family farmsnot connected to Big Food. One farmer said that the government had lost itsunderstanding of rural life and agriculture. ‘I am not saying there is anythingmalicious at all’, he said, ‘But they just don’t understand.’ Oh, but they doand it is very malicious. Another farmer said that the plan was the mostridiculous thing he had ever heard. So it is if you want family farms tosurvive, but not if you don’t.The removal of independent farmers and others from the land is planned to bedone by weather manipulation, economic attacks, government agencies deciding howland, water and resources can be used, and environmental laws. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) is already a terrorist organisation for independentfarmers and growers, and rural communities. I saw a video just before this bookwent to press about the disgusting activities of the Los Angeles County‘Nuisance Abatement Teams’ who are targeting residents in the very sparselypopulated Antelope Valley in the California desert. People are being forced fromtheir homes by ludicrous ‘code violations’ and ordered to destroy theirproperties. One man was told that this was because unnamed ‘neighbours’ hadcomplained about his property when his nearest ‘neighbours’ were ten miles awayin all directions. The residents have been subjected to outrageous harassment bythese brainless goons in uniform, often at gunpoint, and they are bewildered bywhat is going on and why it is being done. I can tell them: Agenda 21. This wasalso the real reason behind the British government’s attempt to sell off thenation’s forests to private institutions.CONDITIONING THE KIDSThe children who are planned to be the adults living in this Agenda 21 nightmareare being programmed to accept their fate as I speak. The bloodlinecreated-and-controlled United Nations Education, Scientific, and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) declared that 2005 to 2015 is ‘The Decade of Education forSustainable Development’ (ESD). Or, put another way, The Decade of MassMind-Controlling Our Kids to be Good Little Slaves. One statement said: > The Decade of ESD is a far-reaching and complex undertaking … that potentially> touches on every aspect of life. The basic vision … is a world where everyone> … learns the values, behavior, and lifestyles required for a sustainable> future and for positive societal transformation. Like I say, The Decade of Mass Mind-Controlling Our Kids to be Good LittleSlaves. One reason for the systematic dumbing down of education is encapsulatedin this comment in one of their ‘sustainability’ documents: > Generally, more highly educated people who have higher incomes can consume> more resources than poorly educated people who tend to have lower incomes. In> this case more education increases the threat to sustainability. Wow! Think about the implications of that statement. The diabolical duo, FatherGeorge Bush and Bill Clinton, supported Agenda 21 during their presidencies andso it must be about death, destruction and control by that definition alone.Clinton established The President’s Council for ‘Sustainable Development’ byanother Executive Order with no political or public debate. This is how Agenda21 is being introduced by stealth and the Totalitarian Tiptoe – Obama’s ‘RuralCouncil’ is only the latest step at the time of writing. There are many otherswaiting in the shadows and we are seeing ‘White House’ and ‘President’s’organisations being used increasingly to usurp even the burning embers ofAmerican democracy. The term ‘sustainable development’ is classic Orwellianlanguage in that it appears to stand for one thing, but means something verydifferent. I am all for doing things in ways that are sustainable in the sensethat they can go on indefinitely as opposed to slash-and-burn and other suchenvironmental destruction. But (a) the people behind this are devastating theplanet with their activities, and (b) Agenda 21 is not about sustainabledevelopment; it is about sustainable control and mass depopulation. A UnitedNations Global Biodiversity Assessment Report called for an 85 per centreduction in human numbers. Heck, you only have to look at the map of theplanned ‘sustainable’ United States to realise the scale of population reductionthat would be necessary for it to be implemented. Jonathan Porritt, anotherpopulation extremist, has been a ‘green’ advisor to Prince Charles and theBritish government. He has called for the British population to be more thanhalved to 30 million. Porritt is the son of Lord Porritt, 11th Governor-Generalof New Zealand and has the option to take the title, The Honourable Sir JonathonPorritt, 2nd Baronet. He has been a chairman of the Sustainable DevelopmentCommission established by bloodline-controlled-to-hisfingertips, ‘shapeshifter’Tony Blair, and he is a patron of Population Matters, formerly the OptimumPopulation Trust. Porritt is also one of the most arrogant, self-obsessed peoplethat I have ever met. He was supported in his stance on population by ProfessorChris Rapley, director of the Science Museum, who said that too many peoplewould make it much harder to reduce carbon emissions by 80 per cent to stop …global warming. This is also being used as an excuse for depopulation.Personally, I think that reducing the emissions of Porritt and Rapley would dofar more for the world. The plan is to advance Agenda 21 as quickly as possiblein the next few years, and this is why the United Nations General Assembly hasdeclared 2011 to 2020 the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity. This isofficially being done to ‘support and promote the implementation of theobjectives of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity’, but the deal is to supportand promote the implementation of the objectives I have been describing here,plus a whole lot more. The mysterious Georgia Guidestones are anastrologically-aligned granite monument in Elbert County, Georgia, and oftencalled ‘America’s Stonehenge’. They were commissioned in 1979 by someone usingthe pseudonym ‘R C Christian’, and they include ten ‘guides’ for the world ofthe future inscribed in a series of languages. Two of these ‘guides’ say:‘Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature;’ and:‘Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.’ Oh really? Andwho does the ‘guiding’, pray? Why, of course, the State.HAARP, GWEN, TETRA, ‘green’ lighting, the ‘climate change’ fraud, chemtrails,Agenda 21 and ‘biodiversity’ are all snakes on the same Medusa. I don’t likebringing bad news, but we need to be adult, straighten our backs and know whatwe are facing. Only then can we do something about it. And remember … we are notalone in dealing with this. Other forces are at work to dismantle the ControlSystem, awaken human awareness and scupper the Reptilian Agenda.Postscript: While the first printing of this book was in production we had themanifestation in Europe of what Zbigniew Brzezinski called in his book the‘technetronic society’. The Problem-Reaction-Solution of the engineeredfinancial crisis in the ‘eurozone’ led to the installing of unelectedtechnocrats (bankers) as prime ministers of both Italy and Greece. They wereYale student Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner, leading member of theBilderberg Group and former international advisor to Coca Cola and GoldmanSachs; and Lucas Papademos, the former vice-president of the European CentralBank, Senior Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Governor of theBank of Greece and visiting professor at Harvard. Monti also became Minister ofFinance in Italy and named a cabinet that included not a single electedpolitician, only technocrats, especially academics.It is no accident that Mario Monti is European President of theBrzezinski-Rockefeller (Rothschild) Trilateral Commission and that LucasPapademos is a Trilateral Commission member."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00380.jpg] The most effective form of control in today’s world, apart from direct controlof the mind, is money, or mooney. When you have lots of money you have far morechoice and power than if you have little or none. How many times do you want todo something or go somewhere, but lack of money gets in the way?Money is the focus of most people, and that’s how the bloodlines want things tostay. Some are focused on accumulating more and more, while most are desperatelytrying to make the rent or mortgage or even earn enough for themselves and theirfamilies to have food to eat. The Rothschilds and the bloodlines have imposed aglobal structure in which virtually everyone is dependent on money, and theyhave made sure that they control the money. They have done this by creating thevery concept of ‘money’ that we have today – the system known as credit andinterest. The idea is to lend people money that doesn’t exist – credit – andcharge them interest on it. This has allowed them to seize most of the world,including whole nations and the planet’s resources, through the accumulation ofdebt. We are back to Mesopotamia again. Priests of the temple in Babylon weremaking loans in the 18th century BC during the reign of King Hammurabi; andtransferring bank deposits to third parties was common by 1000 BC. Money is oneof the bloodlines’ prime methods of control, and among the first bankers in thewestern world were the Knights Templar who ran major financial centres in Londonand Paris. The network of bloodlines known as the Black (Saturn) Nobility,located in Venice and northern Italy, was also highly significant in theexpansion of the monetary system that we know today. They included thosebloodline Satanists, the de’Medici family. The Black Nobility established thefinancial centres of Lombardy in northern Italy together with merchants known asthe ‘Lombards’, a name later used for all bankers in Florence, Genoa, Venice andMilan. The term ‘bank’ has the same Italian origin. It comes from ‘banco’, whichmeans ‘bench’, and originates from the benches on which the moneychangers sat todo their business. Today, judges are called ‘the bench’ as they sit there intheir black (Saturn) robes administering the legal system, which was alsoestablished by the bloodlines that created the banks.The Black Nobility went on to expand their banking activities into Hamburg,Amsterdam and the City of London, the ‘Square Mile’, which is controlled bysecret societies like the Knights Templar. ‘The City’ has a ‘Lombard Street’, areference to the history that I have outlined. The bloodlines’ most destructiveweapon when it comes to money is ‘usury’. This is Medieval Latin for ‘interest’or ‘excessive interest’. There was a ban of usury in the Christian world at onetime and there still is within Islam, at least officially. This was a seriouspiece of ‘good fortune’ for the former Khazars who made their way north from theCaucasus region and into Europe. They followed the religion of Judaism, whichdid not ban usury, and to a large extent the field was left open for them toexploit and establish the rules and the way things have been done to the presentday. The former Khazars, who we now call ‘Jewish’, controlled the trade in goldand silver in places like Germany, where a family called the Bauers would changetheir name to Rothschild, or Red Shield/Sign, the six-pointed star thatrepresents Saturn. ‘Goldsmith’, or ‘Goldschmidt’ in German, became a Jewish namebecause of the association with the trade. Goldsmiths issued paper receipts forthe gold and silver that was deposited in their strongrooms, and these receiptsbegan to be exchanged rather than going through the process of exchanging theactual gold or silver. This stayed in the hands of the goldsmiths andsilversmiths who realised that with very little of the gold or silver ever beingmoved they could issue paper receipts to others who didn’t own the gold andsilver – and charge them interest for doing so. They were lending the wealth ofothers to make fortunes for themselves, and so long as they didn’t issue morepaper receipts (loans at interest) than the gold and silver that the true ownerswould want to withdraw, they could get away with it indefinitely. The bankingsystem that we know today was born, and this is still owned and controlled bythe secret society operating within elements of the former Khazar community thatI call Rothschild Zionism – Rothschild Saturnism.MONEY MADNESSPeople know so little about the banking system that controls their lives. Howmany ask where ‘money’ actually comes from? Oh, it’s the government, isn’t it?Well, no, it’s not. The vast majority of ‘money’ is created out of thin air bythe private banking system owned by the bloodlines, particularly theRothschilds, and it is known as ‘credit’. Put another way, banks are lendingpeople money that doesn’t exist and charging interest on it – just as they werelending paper receipts against gold and silver which did not, in terms ofownership, exist. Humanity is drowning in debt because money is ‘created’ fromthe start as a debt. Bloodline control of government and banking has allowedthem to pass laws through their puppet politicians which make it quite legal forthem to lend some ten times what they have on deposit – and in practice, far,far more. The system is called ‘fractional reserve lending’. Every time youdeposit a pound, a dollar or a euro you are giving the bank the right to lend atleast another ten and charge interest on it. When you go to a bank to borrow,say £50,000 – what happens? Does the bank print the money or transfer preciousmetals to you? No, no. It simply types into your account the ‘money’ that youhave theoretically ‘borrowed’ (although you haven’t, because it doesn’t exist).Now you are responsible for paying back that ‘money’ to the bank, plus interest;and if you can’t do that when the economy crashes or you lose your job, thebanks comes a-calling to take your wealth that does exist – your land, property,possessions or business. This has been happening for hundreds of years and ithas allowed the bloodlines to accumulate most of the wealth of the world andleave the people with mere pieces of paper or figures on a screen which arebacked by nothing and only have buying power because we think they are worthsomething. Oh, but there’s more – much more. When you spend the fresh air‘money’ that you have just ‘borrowed’, let’s say £15,000 to buy a car, theseller takes non-existent ‘money’ from you and deposits the cheque in his or herbank. This second bank can now lend at least ten times the £15,000 and chargeinterest on it! Then the car seller buys something, for say £10,000, and therecipient puts that in his or her bank. Now bank number three can lend at leastten times that figure and charge interest. This all happens from the initial‘loan’ of £50,000 that did not exist in the first place. The amount of interestthat a single loan generates as it passes through the banking system is simplyfantastic. Another thing: when the bank makes a ‘loan’, it ‘creates’ the amountthat you have agreed – the £50,000 in this case. But you are not paying back£50,000. You are paying back that figure plus interest, and the interest isnever ‘created’. Therefore, and by design, there is never even nearly enough‘money’ in circulation at any time for all the principal and interest onoutstanding ‘loans’ to be paid back. This can be hidden better in times ofeconomic expansion as ‘Peter pays Paul’, but during a slump or depression it iscatastrophic for people’s lives, as we are seeing now. People losing theirhomes, businesses and livelihoods is built into the system this way, becausethere is always far more outstanding debt than there is ‘money’ in circulationto repay it (Fig 305 [../Text/index_split_173.html#filepos1288667])."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00381.jpg] Figure 305: Get them in debt and feed them mind-fodder: Gotcha Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) This system gives the bloodlines virtually total control of the game throughwhat is called the ‘economic cycle’ by ignorant economists and financial‘journalists’, as if there is something ‘natural’ about it. There isn’t. The‘economic cycle’ is callous manipulation. The difference between a boom and abust is basically the amount of units of exchange – ‘money’ – in circulation.There can be an expansion in economic activity when a lot of credit money is incirculation. More people are able to buy things and so more things need to beproduced to meet demand, and employment is plentiful; but when ‘money’ incirculation significantly decreases, the opposite happens. People are not ableto buy so many things and so less needs to be made. This leads to people losingtheir jobs and livelihoods, and often their homes, in vast numbers. People andbusinesses tend to get into more debt during a boom. They are confident abouttheir jobs and the order books and they buy bigger houses and cars, and go onholiday to more expensive locations (Fig 306[../Text/index_split_174.html#filepos1293916]). Businesses borrow to buy newplant and machinery to meet expanding demand. The amount of ‘money’ incirculation is crucial to whether we are in an economic boom or depression; andwho controls that? The banks. The ‘economic cycle’ goes like this … Stage 1:Banks stimulate economic activity by making lots of theoretical loans oftheoretical ‘money’ – credit – at low rates of interest to encourage people toborrow. Often you can get a loan in this period to do virtually anything. Aneconomic boom ensues and people and businesses get themselves into staggeringamounts of debt. Stage 2: The bloodline bankers start to take money out ofcirculation at the optimum point when borrowing has reached a peak. This can bedone by raising interest rates which suck more ‘money’ out of circulation to thebanks, or by engineering events that lead to a dramatic reduction in the numberof loans being made. In current jargon, this is known as a ‘credit crunch’.Stage 3: Economic activity plummets, jobs are lost and people and businesses gobankrupt because they can’t repay debt, plus interest. Property, businesses andother wealth are then absorbed by the bloodline banks and corporations whenpeople cannot repay ‘money’ that has never even existed. The reason why theoverwhelming majority of people lose their homes and livelihoods isn’t becausethey can’t be bothered to work. This nightmare happens when the system stopsproducing enough employment for those people to earn a living. Even when itdoes, the system is still insane. Did we really come here to work like slavesmost days of our lives only to survive until ‘death’? Look at it. People areborn and then ‘educated’ just enough to be slaves to work and live in debt untiltheir number is up. The bloodlines are coldly imposing expensive tuition feesfor students to go to college and university to force them into ridiculouslevels of debt (non-existent ‘money’ called credit) that they are then committedto paying back for most of their lives. What is debt? Control. This has reachedthe point where young people are borrowing large sums from the bloodline banksto pay for their own indoctrination and preparation for life as a slave in thebloodline system. What are we doing?? One Scottish ‘academic’ … wait for this …has even called for the selling of organs to be made legal so that students cansell their organs to pay to be ‘educated’ by idiots like this. ‘I am justselling a kidney so I can get a degree in medicine and human health.’ I canunderstand why students have taken to the streets to protest at what is beingdone to them; but what has it changed? Nothing. Trying to reason with law-makingpoliticians is a waste of time. They answer to their masters – not to thepublic. Instead of protesting, just don’t go to college and university. Dosomething else with your life. Is that the only ‘choice’ that we have within AllPossibility? Going to college and university? Don’t go until the system ischanged, and save yourself from being saddled with extreme levels of perceptionprogramming and debt. I left school at 15 and never took a major exam. You caneducate yourself, on your terms – not the system’s."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00382.jpg] Figure 306: Keep ‘em rolling, Ben, print and be damned Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) STEALING THE WORLDHere’s another question about money. Why do governments borrow ‘money’ from theprivate bloodline banking cartel and commit the population to paying it back,plus interest? They are governments that are supposed to run the country. Whydon’t they create their own money interest free and put it into circulationinterest free? Well, we know why by now. The bloodlines own both governments andbanks and so the governments do what is best for the banks. American presidentsAbraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy both introduced forms of interest-freegovernment money that was not borrowed from the banks. They have one other thingin common. The American government borrows much of its ‘money’ from theprivately-owned cartel of banks known as the Federal Reserve System, created bythe Rothschild–Rockefeller networks in 1913 (Fig 307[../Text/index_split_175.html#filepos1296550]). Most people think that ‘the Fed’is part of the government, as I said earlier, because it is called ‘Federal’ andthe ‘central bank of America’. Doesn’t the US president appoint the chairman?The Federal Reserve is a cartel of private banks and the president does notappoint the chairman, except officially. He is told by the bloodlines who it isgoing to be. They don’t hand over multiple millions to secure a president’selection with no strings attached. The deal is: We give you multiple millions tofinance your El-ection campaign and we tell you who is going to be in yourgovernment. The Federal Reserve lends money to the US government and chargesinterest. The Fed owns the dollar, not the government or people. Mayer AmschelRothschild, founder of the dynasty, said: ‘Let me issue and control a nation’smoney and I care not who writes the laws.’ His son, Nathan, who built theRothschild Empire in Britain, also said:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00383.jpg] Figure 307: The Federal Reserve was created to destroy America, and that’sprecisely what it is doing Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) > I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the empire> on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain’s money supply> controls the British Empire, and I control the money supply. I have heard it said that there is a ‘crisis’ of ‘capitalism’ when there is nocapitalism if we are talking about Big Banking, Big Oil, Big Pharma, BigBiotech, Big Food and all the rest. Capitalism, as in competition, is the lastthing they want. The El-lite operate a system that I call 'cartelism'. Oiltycoon John D Rockefeller captured this mind-set when he said: ‘Competition is asin.’ What is happening to the United States and Europe today was planned along, long time ago in an agenda called ‘Steal the World’. The poor, or ‘ThirdWorld’, was the first in the line of fire and now it is the turn of the rest ofus if we stand by and take it. Third World debt has killed hundreds of millionsof people and has devastated the lives of billions, and this is debt on moneythat does not, and will never, exist. I explain the detailed background to howpoor countries were manipulated into shocking levels of debt in … And the TruthShall Set You Free. Africa, Asia and Central and South America were hijackedthrough theoretical ‘credit’ and debt on money which has never, does not, andwill never exist. See if you recognise the modus operandi. When the Europeancolonialists apparently dismantled their far-flung empires, the former colonieswere said to be ‘independent’. But they never were. Physical occupation wasreplaced by financial occupation in preparation for a new and permanent physicaloccupation. The Rothschild bloodline network ensured that political leaders oftheir choosing, and often on their pay-roll, filled the vacuum after thecolonialists departed (at least on paper) and bloodline representatives andsecret societies ran everything from the shadows. This was the sequence ofevents that ensnared the poorest people in the world in a trap set by therichest. The Rothschild Bilderberg group met in May1973 at Saltsjoebaden,Sweden, hosted by the Rothschild Zionist banking family, the Wallenbergs, the‘Swedish Rothschilds’. Among the Bilderberg attendees were:Henry Kissinger; Robert Anderson, owner of Atlantic Richfield Oil; Sir EricDrake, chairman of BP; Sir Dennis Greenhill, a director of BP; Rene Granier deLilliac, of French Petroleum; Gerrit Wagner, president of Royal Dutch Shell;George Ball of Lehman Brothers; David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank;Zbigniew Brzezinski, director of the Trilateral Commission, future nationalsecurity advisor to Jimmy Carter, and now mentor to Barack Obama; and Edmond deRothschild, Mr ‘World Conservation Bank’.Walter Levy, the US Government’s official oil economist for the Marshall Plan(the European Recovery Programme) after the war, presented a proposal to theBilderbergers to hike the price of oil by 400 per cent. What they needed was anexcuse to do this. Five months later came the ‘Yom Kippur War’ of October, 1973when Egypt and Syria invaded Israel. America supported Israel and this led tothe Arab oil dictators announcing an oil embargo, reduced production andmassively inflated prices for the oil that they did produce in protest atAmerica’s backing of ‘the enemy’, which included resupplying weapons during theconflict. But it was all a movie. The world economy was devastated and we had athree-day working week in Britain to ‘preserve fuel stocks’. Millions lost theirjobs and livelihoods across the world. American oil giants like theRockefellers’ Exxon had been reducing domestic oil stocks to ridiculous levelsin the run up to the Yom Kippur War to make the impact even greater. HenryKissinger, then US Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, had assuredPresident Richard Nixon that reducing domestic oil reserves would not be aproblem. It just so happens that Rothschild Zionist Kissinger was the architectof the Yom Kippur War through his ‘shuttle diplomacy’. This involved working inleague with Israel and lying to Egypt and Syria. The Rothschild Bilderberg Groupnow had its enormous oil hike and it was time for stage two. Part of the dealbetween the Rothschild cabal and the Arab oil countries was that they woulddeposit their vastly increased revenues in a series of designated banks,including Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Bank ofAmerica, Barclays, Lloyds and Midland. Eventually, 70 per cent of the oilprofits from members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)were invested in overseas stocks, bonds and land. Sixty per cent of this figurewas deposited with financial institutions based in New York and London, and theywere able to lend at least ten times what they were receiving because of thescam called fractional reserve landing. Populations across the world werestruggling to survive in the wake of the economic crash caused by the oil hikeand cuts in production, but the major banks were awash with money. Soundfamiliar? The banks then sent out streams of representatives across the ThirdWorld to offer them as much credit as they were prepared to take, and they wereespecially looking for corrupt and incompetent politicians that would steal andsquander it. They wanted these countries to default on their by nowextraordinary levels of debt, because the end game was to steal their land andresources. The ‘money’ was loaned at low, but variable, interest rates and oncethe noose of the debt was in place they opened the trap door with a colossalincrease in the rates of interest. This was achieved by the policies ofRothschild partner, Paul Volcker (Rothschild Zionist, Bilderberg Group), thenhead of the Federal Reserve and later part of ‘Obama’s’ original economic team,and the two stooges, President Ronald Reagan (controlled by vice presidentfather George Bush) and British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who thoughtshe was ‘the boss’ when she wasn’t. They introduced under different names thesame economic ‘monetarist’ austerity and ‘privatisation’ programmes – theselling off of state assets to the Rothschild corporations. N M Rothschild inthe City of London was the premier ‘agency’ for privatising British stateassets. These identical policies were called ‘Reaganomics’ and ‘Thatcherism’ andthey had the effect of causing bank interest rates to soar and produce terribleconsequences for the poorest countries on the planet. What became known as‘Third World debt’ reached such dramatic proportions that they could not evenpay back the interest never mind the principal on the illusory figures on ascreen.The Rothschild-created World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)moved in to offer more loans, this time from public money to pay back the loansto the private banks. But this came, as always, at a price that constitutes acrime against humanity. It also allowed for a fundamental transfer of money fromthe global population via the World Bank, IMF and the indebted countriesthemselves to the banking cartel. In this way, the Rothschild corporationsseized ownership of these countries, in effect, and untold hundreds of millionssuffered and died from the impact of extreme poverty and malnutrition. The WorldBank and IMF insisted on the introduction of severe austerity programmes on thetarget populations in areas like health, education and support for the poorest,and they said that land that was growing food for the people must be turned overto growing ‘cash crops’ for the bloodline transnational corporations. Theyinsisted on: state assets being sold off to the corporations; removingregulation to allow those corporations to take over and do whatever they like;tax cuts, or no tax at all for the corporations; cuts in wages; tax increases;and the dismantling of human rights and crushing of trade unions. Loans made toChile in the 1980s came with a demand for wage cuts of 40 per cent; and inMexico, where wages and spending on health, education and other programmes hadto be cut by half, infant mortality tripled. These are the same people who saythat children in the poorest countries must be mass-vaccinated to ‘save theirlives’. There is no contradiction here, though. The financial oppression and thevaccination programmes are both seeking the same end: depopulation. Anotherconsequence of this manipulated Third World debt was the transfer of land fromthe ownership of the state to a ‘World Conservation Bank’, now the GlobalEnvironment Facility’, which I mentioned earlier. This was orchestrated byEdmond de Rothschild who attended the Bilderberg meeting that started the wholesequence. The theme of getting countries into debt they can’t repay and tellingthem what they must do in return for new loans can also be seen in Westerncountries today. The scam they have played so successfully on the poorestcountries in the world has now come to Europe – and it is coming to America,too. In many ways, it already has. Countries such as Ireland and Greece aredeluged with debt, and the Rothschild IMF and European Central Bank are orderingviciously severe austerity programmes and the selling off of state assets to thebloodline corporations. This is being done systematically as the bloodlines seekto own the entire planet. The EU/IMF bailout has forced Greece to establish aprivatisation agency that will transfer real state assets to bloodline banks andcorporations in return for nothing more than figures on a screen. Jean-ClaudeJuncker, head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said that the sovereigntyof Greece would be massively limited and ‘experts’ were heading for the countryto oversee a fire-sale of state assets to private corporations. The financialcatastrophe in Europe is all engineered to steal assets and end sovereignty andthe same is planned for the United States."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00384.jpg] Figure 308: Greenspan – ‘The Wizard’ makes the American economy disappear Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) I explained earlier how the current economic meltdown was Rothschild-engineeredthrough their agents in government such as Alan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist),who was chairman of the US Federal Reserve through the presidencies of RonaldReagan, Father George Bush, Bill Clinton and most of Boy Bush (Fig 308); BenBernanke (Rothschild Zionist), the current ‘Fed’ chairman; Robert E Rubin(Rothschild Zionist) and Larry Summers (Rothschild Zionist), TreasurySecretaries to Bill Clinton; and Timothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist), whoworked with Rubin and Summers in the Clinton years, and is now US TreasurySecretary. These were the key people that triggered the crash in 2008. What wasdone was literally criminal. Banks sold worthless ‘toxic assets’ to pensionfunds and others as a solid gold investment when they knew the opposite wastrue. But, at the time of writing, only one person in the financial sector hasbeen held to account and jailed since 2008 and that was Bernard Madoff(Rothschild Zionist), who stole billions in a Peter-pays-Paul-pays-Peter Ponzischeme. Madoff said that the banks he worked with knew what he was doing. Thetrustee liquidating the former investment firm of this mega-crook said in early2011 that he was suing JPMorgan Chase & Co. for $6.4 billion, alleging that thebank aided and abetted the $65 billion Madoff fraud. Irving H Picard, the lawyerappointed by a New York bankruptcy court, said he was seeking $1 billion in feesand $5.4 billion in damages. A spokesman for Picard said: ‘JPMorgan Chase & Co.was at the very centre of that fraud, and thoroughly complicit in it.’ Thereason Madoff was jailed, as one commentator rightly said, is that he made themistake of stealing from the rich. Do the same to the poor and middle class andyou don’t go to jail – you get an enormous bonus. Dick Fuld (RothschildZionist), the CEO of Lehman Brothers at the time of its collapse, walked awaywith half a billion dollars. Others who were fundamentally responsible for thebanking crisis picked up hundreds of millions in ‘compensation’ while theirvictims lost their homes and their pensions. None of them faced charges fortheir blatant corruption because the banks have their people in the keypositions in the government’s financial law and investigation departments, andmany of these government ‘regulators’ end up working later for the very banksthey decided not to prosecute. Meanwhile, as this was happening, an Oklahomamother of four small children was jailed for ten years after selling marijuanaworth just $31 to an undercover policeman who set her up. They have a name forwhen those in authority and influence are not subject to the same laws as therest of the population: Fascism.GOLD-IN-SACKSIn so many ways, to understand how the present crash came about is to understandthe Rothschild-controlled expression of evil known as ‘Goldman Sachs’. This wasofficially founded in 1869 by the Rothschild Zionist, Marcus Goldman, after heemigrated from Bavaria in the Rothschild fiefdom of Germany. He was one of manyRothschild Zionists who went to America from Germany in the 19th and 20thcenturies to establish major banks, companies and organisations to serve thebloodline agenda. The ‘Sachs’ part of the Goldman operation came with thearrival of his son-in-law, Samuel Sachs, a Rothschild Zionist German–American,whose parents also came from Bavaria. Sachs had a long-time friend in PhilipLehman of the Lehman Brothers banking family. The Lehmans arrived in America,again from Bavaria, in the 19th century. Bavaria was also the birthplace ofHenry Kissinger, Pope Benedict and the Rothschild-created Bavarian Illuminati,founded in 1776, and officially headed by Adam Weishaupt, who fits the bill forwhat I would call today a Rothschild Zionist. Weishaupt was educated by theJesuit Order, another key strand in the web that includes Rothschild Zionism.The Bavarian Illuminati manipulated wars, revolutions and other society-changingevents, including the French Revolution, and was extremely active in the UnitedStates. The Rothschild-controlled Goldman Sachs, headed by Lloyd Blankfein(Rothschild Zionist), is a monster dictating US government policy to suitbloodline demands and it is active around the world, too. Goldman Sachs washeavily involved in the financial crash in Greece and so was JP Morgan Chase.Greece mortgaged airports and roads to Goldman Sachs and others to secure loansthat gave the government money in the short-term while keeping the loans (debt)off the books to overcome debt limit restrictions. At the same time, Goldman wasbetting that Greece would default, thus profiting from the Greek tragedy that ithelped to create.The Goldman technique is to ensure that its people are appointed to the majorfinancial posts in government, and this is what other major corporations do. Ihave detailed in other books how Biotech royalty, Monsanto, has a similarrevolving door between itself and government departments and agencies thatrelate to its areas of operation. Goldman Sachs makes government banking policyas Monsanto makes government biotech policy. Everything else is just detail.Time magazine described Goldman Sachs as ‘the single largest supplier offinancial talent to the government’ and never more outrageously so than duringthe banking bailout. Goldman Sachs also made the biggest single private campaigndonation to Barack Obama. Goldman Sachs received $12.9 billion of borrowedtaxpayers’ money to ‘prevent its collapse’ and crucially benefited from theinitial $85 billion bailout of the insurance giant, AIG, which would havetriggered crippling losses for Goldman had it gone under. AIG would later begiven tens of billions more to keep it afloat, much to the delight of itslong-time chairman, Maurice Greenberg (Rothschild Zionist), who resigned in 2005over allegations of fraudulent business practice, securities fraud, common lawfraud, and other violations of insurance and securities laws. No, surely not?Greenberg is a close friend of Rothschild/Rockefeller agent, Henry Kissinger(Rothschild Zionist), who he appointed to chair AIG’s advisory board, and AIGwas a client of the notorious Kissinger Associates. Greenberg is Honorary ViceChairman and Director of the Rothschild Council on Foreign Relations and amember of the Rothschild Trilateral Commission; chairman, and currently trustee,of the Asia Society; Trustee Emeritus of the Rockefeller University; and anhonorary Trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. All these institutions wereestablished by the Rockefeller family. The Rockefellers and their ‘bosses’, theRothschilds, are both closely connected to Goldman Sachs and they dictatedpolicy to the Bush administration, and now to Obama. I wonder how AIG managed toget so much bailout money? Must have been luck, I guess. What do you think? Thebailouts were instigated after September 2008 by Boy Bush Treasury Secretary,Henry ‘Hank’ Paulson Jr (Fig 309 [../Text/index_split_177.html#filepos1318823]).He was chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs before he joined the government in2006. One article said: ‘The Secretary of the Treasury, who used to be theGoldman CEO, just spent $85 billion to buy a failing insurance giant thathappened to owe his former firm a lot of money. Does that smell right to you?’It never smells right if Goldman Sachs is involved. Paulson appointed formerGoldman Sachs vice president, Neel Kashkari, as head of the Office of FinancialStability to decide who got the bailout money. Kashkari, in turn, appointedReuben Jeffery, a Managing Partner at Goldman Sachs, as interim chief investmentofficer. Other important players in the Treasury were Dan Jester, Steve Shafran,Edward C Forst and Robert K Steel – all Goldman people. Goldman executives atthe pivotal New York Federal Reserve Bank were involved in the bailoutdiscussions. They included Stephen Friedman (Rothschild Zionist), head of theboard of governors, and Robert Rubin (Rothschild Zionist), Bill Clinton’sTreasury Secretary who did so much to prepare the ground for the collapse of2008. He was CEO at Goldman Sachs. Rubin, a co-chairman of the Council onForeign Relations, is a former student at the Fabian Society’s London School ofEconomics, and so is Peter Orszag (Rothschild Zionist) who became Obama’s firstBudget Director. Timothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist) and Larry Summers(Rothschild Zionist) were ‘selected’ by Obama (were selected for him) to dictate‘his’ economic policy. Geithner is a former executive of Kissinger Associates, amember of the Council on Foreign Relations, and President of the New YorkFederal Reserve which made a significant contribution to causing the crash. Heappointed Goldman Sachs lobbyist, Mark Patterson, as his chief of staff at theTreasury. Summers was paid $135,000 by Goldman Sachs for a single day’s‘appearance’ in 2008. Barney Frank (Rothschild Zionist), Chairman of the HouseFinancial Services Committee, had the job of questioning Treasury officials andinvestigating the bailout policy. His top aide was Michael Paese who left tobecome a lobbyist with Goldman Sachs. Chief of Staff to President Boy Bush wasJoshua Brewster Bolten (Rothschild Zionist), who played a major role in theappointment of Goldman Sachs CEO, Henry Paulson, as Treasury Secretary. Boltenwas Executive Director for Legal and Government Affairs with Goldman Sachs inLondon. When AIG hit the rocks in September 2008, a new chief executive wasappointed. This was Edward M Liddy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who held $3million in Goldman shares. He took the job at the request of Paulson, theTreasury Secretary and former Goldman CEO."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00385.jpg] Figure 309: Hank Paulson searches for integrity – in vain. Paul Farrell, a columnist with Marketwatch, said that Goldman ‘rules the world’,and an article in Rolling Stone magazine described Goldman Sachs as ‘a greatvampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity’. The article rightly accusedthe bank of rigging every major market bubble and burst since the GreatDepression. This included the Internet bubble, the commodities bubble and thehousing/credit bubble. They have done this for the reasons I have described:start a boom and a frenzy to invest and then burst the bubble and pick up assetsfor cents on the dollar to vastly increase your control and ownership of thefinancial system and much else. The Rolling Stone article was written by theexcellent Matt Taibbi, a contributing editor, and exposed the central role thatGoldman played in the crash of 2008 and what has followed. He said the ‘bigscam’ was to have ‘a whole bunch of crap, slap it with a triple-A rating, andsell it to a whole bunch of institutional investors’. These institutions, usingthe money of people of modest incomes and pension funds, would then lose theirinvestments and their clients would lose their pension money. The very ‘creditratings agencies’ like Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s that gavetriple-A ratings to this worthless junk in the run-up to the crash of 2008 arethe same ones giving ‘junk’ credit ratings to countries like Ireland, Greece andPortugal with all the devastating consequences for their economies and people.It is so simple when you control the major credit ratings agencies; and Moody’s,Standard and Poor’s and the Fitch Group dominate the market. You get them torate junk as blue chip so you can sell it to a pension fund or other investorsand when you want countries to go under you downgrade their credit rating. Themainstream media is incapable or unwilling to highlight this fantasticabsurdity. What if you know beforehand that these agencies are going to delivera ‘junk’ verdict on a country and when? You bet on them going bankrupt. Someoneplaced a $1 billion ‘trade’ (bet) on the US futures market in July 2011 that theUnited States would lose its triple-A rating. You don’t do that unless you knowit is going to happen. Standard and Poor’s duly dropped the triple-A rating forAmerica in early August 2011. These agencies have no legal or financialpenalties to face no matter how wrong they are and what consequences thiscreates. Matt Taibbi explains how in 2004 the then Goldman CEO, Henry Paulson,asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to relax restrictions, if you cancall them that, on Goldman’s ability to lend money that it didn’t have: > They felt restrained by certain rules that said they had to have one dollar> for every twelve they lent out, so … then chief Hank Paulson went to the SEC> and asked them to basically end those rules, and they did it. There was no> Congressional hearing, no vote or anything like that. The SEC granted Goldman> and four other banks exemptions to these rules and said you can lend as much> money as you want, you don’t really need to have any money. > Within two years, two of those banks went under: Bear Stearns and Lehman> Brothers. This is just because they went to the government and asked for a> change in the rules and they got it. This is what they do all the time and> they also know that if they ever get in serious trouble they could just call> up the government and ask them to give them a whole lot of taxpayer cash to> bail them out, and that has happened over and over again. Taibbi also said that he had never covered a story in which so many people hadsaid that he could not use their names for fear of retribution. He said therewere people in government who were afraid to ‘cross’ Goldman Sachs. OneCongressman had sent out a letter criticising Goldman and within an hour RichardGephardt, the former Democratic presidential candidate, was on the phone ‘actingas a Goldman Sachs lobbyist’ requesting that he take back everything that hewrote in the letter. ‘The big threat is that if you cross Goldman Sachs you arenever going to get campaign contributions again,’ Taibbi said. ‘And not onlyfrom them, probably anyone else in the Democratic Party.’ Goldman Sachs was thebiggest single contributor to Barack Obama’s campaign fund, as I mentionedearlier. Any Obama groupies still believe that he is acting independently and isnot controlled by the El-ite? Goldman Sachs is a tyranny, and for ‘GoldmanSachs’ read Rothschild.Another major coordinating vehicle in all this has been the Group of Thirty.This was established by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1978. The Rockefellersemployed a frontman for this called Geoffrey Bell – yet another graduate fromthe London School of Economics. The chairman of the Group of Thirty is PaulAdolph Volcker (Rothschild Zionist), a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve,graduate from the London School of Economics, Rothschild partner, and appointedby Obama to be Chairman of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.Other Group of Thirty members have included Obama’s Timothy Geithner and LarrySummers. Goldman Sachs is, of course, involved in the Group of Thirty in theform of Managing Director Gerald Corrigan, the former President of the FederalReserve Bank of New York. The United States is drowning in a tsunami of debt toChina, and this has been central to the unfolding plan to destroy the Americaneconomy. The father of the Chinese-speaking Timothy Geithner is Peter FGeithner, who serves with Henry Kissinger on the board of the National Committeeon US–China Relations. Another member of the Group of Thirty is Dr ZhouXiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China. Not coincidentally, Peter FGeithner worked for the Ford Foundation and oversaw the work of Ann Dunham, whowas paid by the Foundation to develop ‘microfinance programmes’ in Indonesia.Ann Dunham is the mother of Barack Obama. Mervyn King, the placeman Governor ofthe Rothschild-controlled Bank of England, is also a member of the Group ofThirty. This former Professor of Economics at the Fabian-controlled LondonSchool of Economics was at the centre of British government policy while allthis corruption and deceit was going on in the United States. The Group ofThirty is one of many Rothschild organisations that coordinate financial policyand action around the world. One of the most important is the Bank forInternational Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. This coordinates bloodlinepolicy through the European Central Bank (established in the Rothschild city ofFrankfurt in 1998), World Bank, International Monetary Fund and national centralbanks.ORGY OF CORRUPTION AND GREEDThe outcome of what I have described has been that government debt (the people’sdebt) has increased by multiple trillions around the world (Fig 310). This moneyhas been given away by the El-ite in government and central banks to the El-itein private banks and other financial institutions (Fig 311[../Text/index_split_178.html#filepos1329232]). The policy of the FederalReserve giving ‘bailout’ money to people who didn’t need it at interest rates solow that they made fortunes lending it to others at higher rates, has now beenexposed many times. Matt Taibbi wrote the following in another brilliant RollingStone article: > The Fed sent billions in bailout aid to banks in places like Mexico, Bahrain> and Bavaria, billions more to a spate of Japanese car companies, more than $2> trillion in loans each to Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, and billions more to a> string of lesser millionaires and billionaires with Cayman Islands addresses.> ‘Our jaws are literally dropping as we’re reading this,’ says Warren Gunnels,> an aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ‘Every one of these transactions is> outrageous’… > … thanks to a whole galaxy of obscure, acronym-laden bailout programs, it> eventually rivaled the ‘official’ budget in size – a huge roaring river of> cash flowing out of the Federal Reserve to destinations neither chosen by the> president nor reviewed by Congress, but instead handed out by fiat [any money> declared by a government to be legal tender] by unelected Fed officials using> a seemingly nonsensical and apparently unknowable methodology. image [../Images/00386.jpg] Figure 310: Ben Bernanke: To put out a fire you pour more petrol on it Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00387.jpg] Figure 311: No caption necessary Taibbi adds that it was ‘as if someone sat down and made a list of everyindividual on earth who actually did not need emergency financial assistancefrom the United States government, and then handed them the keys to the publictreasure’. This included $35 billion in Fed loans to the Arab BankingCorporation of Bahrain at interest rates as low as a quarter of one per cent –and 59 per cent of that bank was owned by Colonel Gaddafi’s Central Bank ofLibya. Even worse, the American government is borrowing money back from theMiddle East at interest rates of three per cent. This is insane on firsthearing, but not, as I have been saying for all these years, if the plan is tobankrupt America and bring it under the control of a world government andcentral bank. Taibbi highlights one ‘bailout’ in particular in which a companycalled Waterfall TALF Opportunity was given nine low-interest ‘loans’ totallingnearly a quarter of a billion dollars. This was very good news for two of itsmain investors, Christy Mack and Susan Karches. Christy Mack just so happens tobe the wife of John Mack, the chairman of Morgan Stanley, who earned $1,235,097in ‘crash year’ 2008 while Morgan Stanley received billions in bailout money.The Macks’ close friend, Susan Karches, is the widow of Peter Karches, one-timepresident of Morgan Stanley’s investment-banking division, and the low interestrates from the Fed ‘loan’ ensured a good profit. Most of it was used to purchasestudent loans and commercial mortgages. What did any of this have to do with‘saving the economy’? Nothing – and the same with most of the rest. They werejust pouring taxpayers’ ‘money’ (now debt) into the pig trough in which thebloodlines and their associates permanently have their snouts. Government moneywas not only given with next-to-no interest; the receivers didn’t even need torepay the money. They gave the taxpayers, via the Federal Reserve, their toxicassets as ‘collateral’, yes collateral, to be kept if the ‘loan’ was not repaid.This has morphed the trillions of dollars of bank debt into government debt andso the people’s debt – hence that governments are going bankrupt and inflictingdraconian austerity measures. But, hey, it gets crazier. ‘Emergency’ loans madeby the Federal Reserve at virtually nil interest were then used to lend back tothe government at higher interest rates through buying government bonds! Thiswas all a scam to ensure an incredible transfer of wealth from government (‘thepeople’) to some of the world’s richest bankers and others (ultimately theRothschild network). Matt Taibbi colourfully puts it like this: ‘… the federalaid they received actually falls under a broader category of bailoutinitiatives, designed and perfected by Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke andTreasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, called “giving already stinking rich peoplegobs of money for no fucking reason at all”.’ Or, in the words of BarryRitholtz, author of Bailout Nation: ‘[It was] … free money for shit. It turnedinto “Give us your crap that you can’t get rid of otherwise”.’"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00388.jpg] Figure 312: Ben Bernanke – destroying America The Federal Reserve was forced kicking and screaming to make public where themoney went. Nine trillion dollars of taxpayer debt went in ‘short-term loans’ tothe banking system that caused the crisis – 2.2 trillion to Citigroup; 2.1trillion to Merrill Lynch; 2 trillion to Morgan Stanley; 600 billion to J.P.Morgan; and a fantastic amount was handed over to foreign banks, including 1.2trillion to British banks. What? By the ‘central bank’ of America? The ‘Fed’asked for no collateral worth the name against these extraordinary ‘loans’, andthey were given with no conditions such as: we will give you the money, but youmust not foreclose on homeowners. It was just handed over; do with it what youlike. Why wouldn’t they do that when the head of the Fed is the RothschildZionist Ben Bernanke whose job has been, along with Rothschild Zionist AlanGreenspan, to destroy the American economy in line with the plan dictated by theRothschilds (Fig 312). The official United States national debt is heading for$15 trillion at the time of writing, but that is nothing like the true figure.It is rising by about $4 billion a day, and already even the official debtrepresents nearly $50,000 for every American citizen (Fig 313[../Text/index_split_180.html#filepos1336283]). It was reported in the summer of2011 that the Apple corporation had more cash reserves than the United Statesgovernment – $76.4 billion compared with $73.7 billion (and that was borrowed,anyway). Nearly two million fewer Americans had a job 28 months after Obama’seconomic ‘stimulus’ package (more debt) had been passed by Congress and includedlarge sums to fund Smart Meters. This is all being done to a script. Thetaxpayer bailouts were followed by outrageous bonuses for the bankers; mass homeforeclosures; a refusal to lend ‘money’ to stimulate economic activity; andinterest rates for savers of next to nothing while bank fees and overdraft ratesare constantly increased and the amount of our own ‘money’ that we can withdrawcontinually decreased. London’s Daily Mail revealed that Lloyds TSB, one of thebailed-out British banks, was charging an annual interest rate of … wait for it… 46 million per cent for people overdrawn ‘without authorisation’, and othermajor British banks are close behind. One report explained:A Lloyds customer who goes £200 into the red without an agreed overdraft for 10days would rack up charges of £85.95. This breaks down into eight daily chargesof £10, a ‘usage fee’ of £5 and interest of 95p. Annualised, that makes46,450,869% APR."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00389.jpg] Figure 313: Americans are suffering the consequences of extraordinary levels ofdebt Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) Those controlling the banking system, most notably the House of Rothschild andtheir subordinates like the Rockefeller family, are the world’s biggestfraudsters and crooks, and their minute-by-minute exploitation is why thedivision between the rich and poor has become so shockingly extreme. Inequalitybetween a tiny elite and the rest of the world was breathtaking even before thecurrent crisis broke in 2008, and it’s far worse now and getting more so by theday. Senator Bernie Sanders has pointed out that the top one per cent earnedmore than 23 per cent of all income in America in 2007 and more than the entirecombined income of the bottom 50 per cent. The percentage of income going tothat one per cent has nearly tripled since the 1970s; and the top one twelfth ofone per cent earns 12 cents of every dollar earned in America. At the same time,800,000 unemployed American workers lost their only source of income – theiraverage $300 a week unemployment benefit. Another 1.2 million will follow, andmillions more in 2012. These are people with children to care for, but they nowhave no income whatsoever and the chances of getting a job are virtually zero.While charity soup-kitchens and their like are overwhelmed with demand – a needthat increases by the day – the Obama administration, supported by theRepublican ‘opposition’, are continuing a policy of tax breaks for millionairesand billionaires. In 2011, Senator Bernie Sanders revealed in a speech onCapitol Hill that some of the world’s biggest corporations not only paid no tax,they were getting refunds from the Internal Revenue Service. He said thatExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit in 2009, paid no tax and received a $156million tax rebate. Bank of America made $4.4 billion, paid no tax and receiveda $1.9 billon rebate. General Electric made $26 billion in profit in the UnitedStates, paid no tax and received a $4.1 billion rebate. Sanders went on to nameothers, such as Boeing and Chevron. At the same time that these giantcorporations were paying no tax and collectively receiving billions in rebates,the most vulnerable in America society – children, the poor and the elderly –were being hammered by government spending cuts. Obama is an Obamanation, abag-carrying ‘yessir’ fraud beyond words.NOT HIM AGAINI said at the time of the crash in 2008 that the plan was threefold: (1) crashthe economy; (2) have governments (the people) throw incredible amounts of moneyat the banks until the coffers were exhausted; and (3) crash the economy againat a time when governments have no means to respond; and then have the bankersand financial crooks step forward as the saviours to offer the solution – theirsolution. This, I said and wrote then, would be a total restructuring of theglobal financial order based on a world central bank, eventually a singleelectronic currency, and the control of global finance in fewer hands than everbefore. Fast-forward two-and-a-half years to 2011 and the conference at BrettonWoods in New Hampshire hosted by the heartless Rothschild frontman, billionairefinancier, George Soros (Rothschild Zionist). The location was chosen because itwas at Bretton Woods in July 1944 that the allied countries in World War IIgathered to agree a new economic order (one of the endlessProblem–Reaction–Solutions made possible by that engineered conflict). This ledto the creation of the Rothschild-controlled International Monetary Fund (IMF)and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, now part of theWorld Bank. The Soros conference, at the same Mount Washington Hotel, did nothave the power to agree a new economic order; but that was not its aim. Theconference was another high-profile stepping stone on the road to that end withSoros calling for … a world central bank. The conference was co-hosted by Sorosand his Institute for New Economic Thinking (we want a world central bank andsingle world currency) and the Centre for International Governance Innovation(we want a world government). The latter is a ‘think tank’ established byCanadian billionaire, Jim Balsillie. The big sell is now on to massivelycentralise world governance and finance and this was the latest throw of thesales pitch by the billionaires to the ‘little people’, which also include mostof the here-today-gone-tomorrow politicians. How apt it was that among theattendees and speakers was Larry Summers offering his solution to the problemshe has done so much to create. The same goes for former British Prime Minister,Gordon Brown, a student and follower of Alan Greenspan. Brown mirrored hisidol’s deregulation policy with the same disastrous consequences during hisyears as the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer. People like this should not belet loose on a piggy bank, but here they were in their arrogance telling us howto sort out the mess that they created. The system has always been rigged, butnow more so than ever before and growing by the hour. Our world, our lives andthose of our children and grandchildren, are being hijacked before our veryeyes. Americans and others all over the planet are suffering terribleconsequences from what I have just described with large numbers losing theirhomes, and either living ‘rough’ or in the ever-emerging tent cities (Fig 314[../Text/index_split_181.html#filepos1342841]). A USA Today report said thatonly around 45 per cent of Americans have a job. Meanwhile, caring peoplefeeding the homeless and hungry are being arrested for doing so. Fascism is notcoming to America; it is here."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00390.jpg] Figure 314: Tent city America Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) At a time when payments to the poor and vulnerable are being slashed and the taxburden ever increased, the United States is spending, when all the hidden costsare added in, something like a trillion dollars a year on the military tofurther the bloodline campaign of killing and acquisition. If the United States’government reduced military spending by 85 per cent it would still be spendingmore than any other country on the planet to oppress and kill people. But, ofcourse, it is not the ‘American military’ protecting Americans; it is thebloodlines’ military plundering the world and this is why ‘Defence’ (attack)spending is so outrageously high. The same money-no-object spending on themilitary while financially squeezing the population is happening worldwide.Canada is one of the most Rothschild Zionist-controlled countries on Earth. Theyrun the whole show and own the government of whichever party may be in office.While Canadians are suffering from the world recession, and most want lessdefence spending, the government announced that it was negotiating to establishmilitary bases in Kuwait, Germany, Jamaica, Senegal, Kenya, Singapore and SouthKorea. This is being done to expand the reach of the emerging world army – notfor the benefit of Canadians. The government has more than doubled ‘defence’(war) spending since the year 2000, and Defense Minister Peter MacKay said: ‘Thefocus of the planning, let’s be clear, is on our capability for expeditionaryparticipation in international missions – we’re big players in NATO, we’re acountry that has become a go-to nation in response to situations like what we’reseeing in Libya, like we saw in Haiti, we are constantly working within thatparadigm of countries to see where we can bring that niche capability to bear.’To think these people are in government. Terrifying. But those words‘expeditionary participation in international missions’ tell the story of whatit is all about. They are already fighting a new world war – it’s just not yetofficial. World War III actually began on September 11th, 2001. JosephLie-berman (Rothschild Zionist), chairman of the Senate Committee on HomelandSecurity and Governmental Affairs, personified the mendacity and lack ofcompassion of these people when he said that social security payments had to becut to pay for ‘defence’ (war): ‘Bottom line, we can’t protect theseentitlements and also have the national defence we need to protect us in adangerous world while we are at war against Islamist extremists who attacked uson 9/11 and will for a long time to come.’ Oh, go away, you silly man. JohnBoehner, current Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, saidthat the retirement age should be raised to 70 for the same reason.THE EUROZONE – EUROLOANThe fraudulent bailout of the banks has left most European countries indesperate financial straits. Irish people are going to be swamped withincredible levels of debt for generations. And why? It is not that they rackedup the debt, or that they are refusing to work. The demolition of the Irisheconomy was caused by the sickening greed of the banks that went under as aresult and were bailed out by billions from the Irish government. Even this wasnot enough, and the government has borrowed astonishing amounts of money fromthe Rothschild European Union, European Central Bank (ECB), headed byJean-Claude Trichet (Rothschild Zionist), and the IMF, headed at the time byDominique Strauss-Kahn (Rothschild Zionist). The government of the truly uselessBrian Cowen resigned in the face of this catastrophic policy, but Cowen refusedto go until he had negotiated the loans with the IMF and ECB. The obvious andhonest thing to have done would have been to resign immediately and let theincoming government decide what to do. But Cowen had his orders – don’t resignuntil the deal is done and the new government handed a fait accompli. This isthe same Cowen who insisted on another referendum over centralisation of powerin the EU after the public had voted ‘no’. The man should be in jail. The Irishgovernment has so far either paid out, or has secured the borrowing to pay out,some 135 billion euros. This is not to support the Irish people, but to stop thebanks from going under and bondholders from losing out. Targeting funding tokeep people in their homes is never an option. Such a people-based responsewould have made the banks and bankers pay the price of their greed andcorruption. The same could have been done in America where untold numbers arelosing their homes because they can’t pay the very banks that they collectivelykept alive. Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and others are also in desperatetrouble and this is playing out to the blueprint of bloodline design as theypush on towards total global control and ownership. George Soros (RothschildZionist) fuelled the flames by saying that an economic collapse in Europe wasinevitable. He should know given that he is trying to make it happen. His mate,Jean-Claude Trichet (Rothschild Zionist), head of the European Central Bank, hasbeen using the engineered crisis to call for the appointment of a European UnionTreasury Secretary with independent authority over all European banks. Sourcesinside the Bilderberg conference in Switzerland in June 2011 said that Trichetmade the call in his speech there. Problem–Reaction–Solution. Trichet thenrepeated the theme when he accepted the Charlemagne Prize, which is given tothose who do most to enslave Europeans in the iron grip of the European Union.Previous winners have been Richard Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, founder of thePan-European Movement funded by the bloodline Habsburg family that got the‘European project’ underway; paedophile and child killer, Edward Heath, theformer British Prime Minister who signed Britain into the EU straightjacket;Henry Kissinger; King ‘Illuminati’ Carlos of Spain; Queen ‘Bilderberger’ Beatrixof the Netherlands; Tony Blair; and Bill Clinton. Rothschild Zionist Trichetwill at least feel right at home. The prize is named after Charlemagne, ruler ofwhat we now call the region of France and Germany. He followed the reign of theMerovingian kings and he was a founder of what became the Holy Roman Empire.Charlemagne is a bloodline hero, and Hitler and the Nazis worshipped him as agod. Trichet told the audience at the award ceremony: > In this Union of tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, would it be too bold, in> the economic field, with a single market and a single central bank, to> envisage a ministry of finance for the Union? Come on, you bloody liar, you know that’s the plan. This is another steppingstone, another Totalitarian Tiptoe, to a world ministry of finance. Theintroduction of the European single currency, the euro, was designed to entrapthe countries of Europe in a straightjacket of centralised economicdictatorship, and laws were imposed to insist that ‘bondholders’ in the bankshad to be secured by governments against losses. A ‘bondholder’, a term we haveheard a lot about since 2008, is a financial speculator who buys ‘bonds’ inbanks, companies and governments for an agreed period and interest rate. This isspeculation – nothing more – in the hope that you will get what you agreed, butwhen any losses are guaranteed by governments if the investment goes pear-shapedit means that (a) the need to make sensible investments no longer appliesbecause you can’t lose; and (b) the taxpayer is stuck with repaying thebondholder any losses on what is a private investment. Crazy – but then theworld is. The bondholders in Allied Irish Banks are having their losses coveredby Irish and European taxpayers now losing their jobs, homes and services. Theyinclude the Rothschild front, Goldman Sachs, and Rothschild & Cie Gestion, anasset management branch of Groupe Rothschild & Cie Banque. No doubt a stream ofthese other ‘bailed out’ bondholders will have Rothschild connections. All thesefinancial speculators and manipulators are having their losses repaid by peoplein Ireland and the other Europeans who are already in dire straits. They arepaying with reduced wages, increased taxation, lost homes and jobs, and severecutbacks in basic services. The system is rigged from top to bottom, but manystill can’t see the plainly obvious. I read this comment on a website forumduring a discussion about the inequality and unfairness of the economic system: > This society is very fair. The rich first generation [parents] did not come> out of the mountains and become people with money. Every rich person thinks of> their next generation, this is normal. I, to, am a poor person, but I am> willing to go create opportunities, because to become a rich person requires> thinking of a plan … Don’t have this attitude towards society. As long as the> first generation’s money came cleanly, it should be fine. Laugh or cry? Difficult choice. A plan? Easy. To become rich you just stealmoney from lots of poor people. Humanity has been a slave race for aeons inwhich there is one law for the few and another for all the rest; but, even byhuman standards, we are moving into extreme levels of mass control, oppressionand, yes, sheer slavery. We slave – they steal. I have been warning about thisfor so long, and it is here. What we are seeing is the big squeeze in which theRothschild networks use their governments and banks to squeeze the people untiltheir pips squeak. The less we resist, the harder they squeeze and so events andinjustice become ever more extreme. This is what we are seeing now. It is notonly that if we’ll take this, we’ll take anything, but also that if we take thisthey will give us yet more in the months and years to come. We have to stopbeing spectators and victims and start running at these people and their evil.This is starting to happen, but it has to be increased dramatically. A majorthing that we can do is refuse to leave homes that are foreclosed by banksbecause of the economic straits of the home ‘owner’ caused by the banks. Thesystem is terrified of this because it could not cope. If a few individuals doit they can be picked off, but not if hundreds of thousands and more do so. Thebanks are speeding the process of foreclosure in the United States by issuingfake documents signed by fake people because, insiders say, they cannot dealwith so many foreclosures and the time it takes to evict people lawfully. Themortgages have been sold and resold through so many banks and financialinstitutions that they have no idea much of the time who actually owns themortgage and the home they are seeking to foreclose. If there was a mass refusalto leave foreclosed homes, the system would be in tatters – it could not copewith the numbers. We need people to focus on organising and coordinating apeaceful rebellion and non-cooperation with our own enslavement. We need to makewhat would be a tremendous collective statement of intent by refusing to takeour families onto the streets because some corrupt and evil bank tells us thatwe must. When are we going to draw the line en masse? If not now, then probablynever. It is time, long past the time, for us to say ‘NO MORE!’ If we don’t,we’ve seen nothing yet. British wartime Prime Minister, Winston Churchill(Rothschild Zionist), was another pawn in the game, and a willing one; but hewas absolutely right when he said this: > If you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without bloodshed;> if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you> may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against> you and only a small chance of survival. There may even be a worse case: you> may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to> perish than to live as slaves. But it is not about fighting; it is about ceasing to cooperate with our ownenslavement. I’ll expand on this in the final chapter.Postcript: While this book was in production a new head of the European CentralBank was appointed to replace Jean-Claude Tricket. This was Mario Draghi, formerVice Chairman of Goldman Sachs International, governor of the Italian CentralBank and an insider to his fingertips. Goldman Sachs was fundamental in creatingthe problem and now ensures that its ‘people’ are appointed to oversee the‘solutions’."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00391.jpg] No-one with a brain in any way generating electrical activity could fail to seehow the world has changed dramatically since September 11th, 2001. Tony Blairsaid that the world changed on 9/11 and, of course, that was the idea. The scaleof control and surveillance, the gathering Gestapo employed throughout lawenforcement and security, is the bloodline Reptilian Alliance/Saturnian gameplan made manifest (Fig 315 [../Text/index_split_183.html#filepos1359792]).It was so obvious to me many years ago that a new breed was taking over the‘uniform professions’ and those in government administration at all levels. Myquestion was how this was being done on such a scale. A significant contributionhas been made towards recruiting the ‘right people’ by targeting a certain typeof personality known as ‘narcissistic’. This is the same personality trait thatthey seek out for their ‘power’ positions in politics, banking, business andmedia. Barack Obama, David Cameron, Nicolas Sarkozy, Tony Blair and JuliaGillard – I rest my case. The wording and questions on application forms, plusother techniques, are used to sift out the narcissists among the applicants.Narcissism is defined as: ‘excessive love or admiration of oneself … apsychological condition characterised by self-preoccupation, lack of empathy [aclassic reptilian trait] and unconscious deficits in self-esteem’. In short,they are arrogant and lack empathy on the surface while being emotional cripplesunderneath. All these traits are used to effect by the bloodline network andthey most powerfully lock people into the Saturn–Moon Matrix broadcasts andactivate their DNA program. Brian Gerrish, a former British naval officer, hasdone considerable research into recruiting and ‘training’ organisations thatemploy ‘headhunting’ techniques that identify the narcissists. One in particularstands out in Britain and operates in many other countries. This is anorganisation called ‘Common Purpose’ which ‘trains’ the leaders in government,local government and the police – pretty much throughout the entire system, infact. Brian says of the narcissistic personality:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00392.jpg] Figure 315: The face of Fascism Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00393.jpg] Figure 316: What have we come to? Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) > Their love of themselves and power automatically means that they will crush> others who get in their way. I received a major piece of the puzzle when a> friend pointed out that when they made public officials re-apply for their own> jobs several years ago they were also required to do psychometric tests.

Psychometrics involves the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes andpersonality traits, mostly using carefully designed questionnaires and tests.You can clearly see what Brian Gerrish describes happening all over the world asthe power-crazy and power-trippers are appointed into law enforcement, securityand government administration. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA)in the United States is an outstanding example (Fig 316). So many of them – notall yet, but they’re working on it – strut around as if they own the world andtreat passengers with contempt. The relationship is akin to a prison warder anda prisoner. It’s all ‘do this’, ‘don’t do that’, with everyone looked upon as aterrorist threat until proven otherwise. They sexually abuse distraught andcrying little children, force the elderly and infirm to go through degrading‘checks’, and many of them have no sense of reasonableness or common sensewhatsoever. They are narcissistic robots in a uniform with a few honourableexceptions. One had to be sacked when he walked through Los Angeles Airport atthe end of a shift banging his chest and shouting, ‘I have the power.’ Well,actually, he doesn’t. None of them have. The uniform has the ‘power’, not them,because the uniform is an extension of the State. They are just animating it,that’s all. The power is in the wardrobe – not in them. This is the case withall people in uniform. I say to them sometimes, ‘Take off your uniform and whereis your power?’ or, ‘Get a different job – where is your power?’ Nowhere,because it was always in the uniform. The sad thing is that while they areimposing the will of the State (the hidden forces that control the State) theyare being treated as contemptuously as they treat others. The authorities knewthat the full-body radiation scanners would kill staff who worked with themregularly; but who cares when there will always be someone who needs a job?There are so few who are manipulating humanity in full knowledge of what theyare doing that they need to recruit from the target population to suppress thetarget population – hence the TSA, law-enforcement agencies and the military.These people are controlled by the bloodlines, but the great majority are not ofthe bloodlines. Mind-manipulating techniques are used, too, to develop the‘right type’. A common one is neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) which useswords and phrases to program perception and behaviour. Brian Gerrish again: > It is interesting that many of the mothers who have had children taken by the> State speak of the Social Services people being icily cool, emotionless and,> as two ladies said in slightly different words, ‘… like little robots’. We> know that NLP is cumulative, so people can be given small imperceptible doses> of NLP in a course here, another in a few months, next year etc. In this way,> major changes are accrued in their personality, but the day by day change is> almost unnoticeable. > An example is the policeman who would not get on a bike for a press photo> because he had not done the cycling proficiency course.

A normal> person would have arrived, perhaps thought of the risk for a moment, and dived> in. To the police now ‘reframed’, they followed ‘normal’ procedure. There you have the reason why we are seeing the type of personality in so-called‘public service’ dramatically changing as the ‘old school’ make way for thenewly-schooled. The whole ridiculous nonsense known as ‘Political Correctness’was developed and introduced by a group of Rothschild Zionists known as the‘Frankfurt School’ which was established in the city where the House ofRothschild began. The Frankfurt School was an outgrowth of Marxism, yet anotherRothschild creation, and promoted by Karl Marx (Rothschild Zionist) who marriedinto the aristocracy. The Frankfurt School was funded into existence by FelixWeil (Rothschild Zionist), and the first director was Carl Grünberg (RothschildZionist) followed by Max Horkheimer (Rothschild Zionist). Two of the primeinfluences on the school’s thinking were Theodor W Adorno (Rothschild Zionist)and Herbert Marcuse (Rothschild Zionist). The Frankfurt School relocated toSwitzerland before moving to New York in 1935, and six years later settled inCalifornia, which, for this reason, became the global capital of politicalcorrectness. This Rothschild Zionist centre for social engineering set out tocontrol American social science, and here are just some of the changes that theysought to introduce to American and global society. Perhaps you can recognisethem: • The creation of racism offences. • Continual change to create confusion. • The teaching of sex and homosexuality to young children. • The undermining of schools’ and teachers’ authority. • Huge immigration to destroy national identity. • The promotion of excessive drinking. • Emptying of churches [targeting anything that brings people together]. • A legal system with bias against victims of crime. • Dependency on the State or State benefits. • Control and dumbing down of the media. • Encouraging the breakdown of family.None of these goals are to benefit people; they are only to control people.National identity is being destroyed by mass immigration and it is clear thatthis is the real motivation behind the borderless European Union, and the UnitedStates failing to adequately police the border with Mexico and making it easierfor so-called ‘illegal aliens’ to be given residency. They want a borderlessUnited States, Canada and Mexico as part of the North American Union and todestroy the self-identity of all three. A sense of nationhood is a big potentialblock to the acceptance of a single uniform world and so they are working todelete any sense of national identity. The bloodlines don’t care abouthomosexuals any more than they care for the children the bloodline families andtheir lackeys abuse while claiming to protect them. Rothschild Zionist frontslike the Anti-Defamation League are not concerned with ‘racism’ or ‘minorities’.They merely use these to justify more control, to suppress freedom of speech andto introduce ‘hate laws’ to make your opinion a criminal offence in which truthis no defence. You can read the detailed story of political correctness in HumanRace Get Off Your Knees and the same with much in this book, which is writtenspecifically to present the information crisply with the essential dotsconnected. Political correctness is a means of censoring the right to freeexpression by constantly curtailing what is deemed acceptable to say and do. Alaw passed in Tennessee in 2011 is a perfect example. It makes transmitting ordisplaying an image online a criminal offence if it is likely to ‘frighten,intimidate or cause emotional distress’ to anyone who may see it. This meansvirtually every image. You’ll always find someone who will be offended bysomething. The bill was signed into law by Governor Bill Haslam, and thisnonsense carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison or a fine of $2,500.Please remember this at the next election anyone from his state. The bloodlineswant laws like this to be universal, and this is not to protect people frombeing frightened, intimidated or emotionally distressed. They use these samelaws to stop themselves and what they are doing from being exposed. They aredeveloping another ‘front’ with regard to this, with ‘super injunctions’ thatprevent information being published about a person or organisation, and to evenban the disclosure that this has been done. Major corporations have taken outthese super-gagging orders to block publication of information about theiractivities.ANYBODY HOME? NO? OKAY, I’LL CALL BACKYou constantly see the personality types now being recruited into ‘publicservice’ in countless videos posted on YouTube by people shocked at how thesethugs-in-uniform behave. Two rule-book-for-a-brain police officers were filmedstopping to question a man in a London park who was holding a sign saying:‘Everything is okay’. A long conversation ensued about whether this was inbreach of ‘royal park’ regulations; and one of them pulled out the rule book tosee if he could find something that applied. Put ‘Everything is OK in Hyde Park(Speakers Corner)’ into Youtube. There was the shocking video of young peoplebeing brutally attacked by police for dancing, without even much animation, atthe Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington D.C. in May 2011. One man was thrownto the solid floor. They were protesting against a ruling by a federal judgethat made dancing at the memorial constitute an illegal demonstration. Ludicrouslaws like this are being introduced by the bucketload and so you need ludicrousand vicious people like the police officers in this case to enforce them (Figs317 [../Text/index_split_185.html#filepos1378437] and 318[../Text/index_split_185.html#filepos1378479]). The authorities want to banpeople from filming police on duty to hide their increasingly insane and brutalbehaviour from the public. Police in Rochester, New York, arrested a woman forfilming them from her own front garden when they stopped a car and questionedthe driver outside her home. 28-year-old Emily Good was charged with‘obstructing governmental administration’ after she politely refused a policeofficer’s order to stop filming and go back into her house. The narcissistic andbrainless police officer said he felt threatened (aaahhh, bless him) and sheappeared to be ‘very anti-police’. When she refused to stop her legal filming ofthis silly man he arrested her for ‘not listening to our orders’. Type thewords: ‘Rochester Police Arrest Woman in Her Front Lawn for Filming TrafficStop’ into YouTube and you will see what she filmed. There is anotherextraordinary example of this ‘new police’ mentality with ‘Officer Bubbles’. Youknow how they used to have a ‘king of kings’? Well, Officer Bubbles is a Moronof Morons and unfortunately he has unbelievable numbers of people in uniformvying for the title. Put: ‘Officer Bubbles – From Bubbles to Bookings’ intoYouTube (a cup of sweet tea is recommended). They even have lower-rankednarcissists policing litter bins now. An 85-year-old New York woman was in themedia after a ‘sanitation agent’ (was he armed?) chased her and threatened herwith arrest for putting newspapers in a trash bin. ‘I froze,’ she said. ‘He justfrightened the hell out of me, scared me to death, I was terrified.’ She saidthe worker demanded a form of identification and threatened to ‘put her away’ ifshe didn’t comply. He fined her $100 for putting ‘household trash’ into thewrong bin, and when she complained at the size of the fine he threatened to makeit $300. This is the mentality being specifically employed to control thepopulation down to the finest detail. Some 20 teenagers were arrested by morewoodenheads-in-uniform in Oklahoma City for standing outside a cinema in allegedbreach of the city’s imposed curfew for everyone under 18 years of age. Statecurfew?? They were arrested while waiting for adults to collect their cars afterwatching the movie. Going to a movie theatre exempts you from the ‘curfew’, butthese God’s gifts to brain cell activity went ahead with their arrests anyway.One mother called the officers ‘thuggish’ – exactly the type being recruitedtoday all over the world. The teenagers were taken to a ‘Crisis InterventionCenter’ and kept for at least six hours before even being allowed to see theirparents. They were reported to have ‘felt violated, harassed and frightened atthe hands of Oklahoma City law enforcement’. Well, get used to it unless we areprepared to come together and put an end to this. These curfews are becomingmore common in the Totalitarian Tiptoe with British Prime Minister, DavidCameron (Rothschild Zionist), suggesting them as one ‘solution’ to themanufactured riots in London and other cities in 2011. Chicago introduced acurfew that means that children under 12 have to be in their parents’ home by8.30pm every night. The Mayor of Chicago backing this? Rahm Emanuel (RothschildZionist), former Israeli soldier and Obama’s minder during his crucial firstyears in office. Ted Baillieu, Premier of the Australian State of Victoria, hasintroduced laws (permanently after a ‘trial’) that give police the right toissue on-the-spot fines for language that is ‘indecent, disorderly, offensive orthreatening’. Who decides that? The police do. How about on-the-spot fines forpolice officers and premiers of Victoria who are ‘indecent, disorderly,offensive or threatening’? Then there is Kelly Morningstar, police chief inMidway, Georgia, who ‘closed down’ the lemonade stand of three young girlsbecause they had not obtained $50-a-day business and food permits – even thoughthe stand was at the home of one of the girls. Kelly Morningstar explained thisvictory for neuron deficiency: ‘We were not aware of how the lemonade was made,who made the lemonade, of what the lemonade was made with, so we actedaccordingly by city ordinance.’ Well, we could say the same about you, mate. Howand what are you made of, and with what ingredients? They clearly do not includeintelligence or consciousness. If you want to see another absolutely staggering‘lemonade’ story put the words ‘Children defy police in Washington, purchaselemonade at Capitol’ into YouTube. The young girl officer in the peaked cap whokeeps blocking the camera needs some serious help. I do hope she seeks it oneday. A computer store might be the first place to contact – the softwaredepartment. These ‘lemonade raids’ are happening so often across America that itis obviously coordinated."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00394.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00395.jpg]Figs 317 and 318: Dancing is a crime – if you have not got two brain cells torub together, that is. Truly ludicrous man at work These arrogant narcissists go particularly apeshit when their power ischallenged and they are questioned or not taken seriously. I pointed out to asecurity person at London’s Heathrow Airport that it was not the law that I hadto remove my belt, as a security expert had confirmed on television thatmorning. Well, away she went. ‘I know what the law is,’ she shouted, and, don’tquestion me’ was the basic response. I asked her again: ‘Is there a law that youhave to take your belt off?’ Eventually she agreed that there wasn’t, but herego had been so pricked that she stormed off into the distance not to return. Idid the same with a ‘uniform’ at London’s Gatwick Airport and he nearly hadapoplexy. I had to ask for his supervisor eventually because of his behaviour,and when the guy arrived he was so young I felt like asking him if his mum knewhe was out. You don’t even have the option of a ‘pat-down’ in Britain if you areselected to go through a full-body scanner. Refuse, and you don’t fly. Hospitalconsultant Dr Antonio Aguirre was removed by police from Manchester Airport inEngland when he declined to take what he called a ‘radiation assault’. He saidquite rightly that the scanners can cause cancer. He said: ‘X-rays are known tocause cancer and I think somebody will get cancer from this body scanner whetherit’s me or someone else.’ It will be lots of people, especially the staff whooperate them. Let’s think about this for a second and take in just how far wehave already gone down the road to fascism. You are not allowed to fly unlessyou agree to be irradiated at a threat to your health and even life. Are westanding for this? Transportation Security Administration (TSA) staff in theUnited States are extraordinary. They grope women and children in ‘pat downs’and many of them specialise in public humiliation. A 95-year-old woman in awheelchair suffering from leukaemia was forced to remove an adult nappy, ordiaper, by the TSA at a Florida airport before leaving on a flight to saygoodbye to relatives before she died. A six-year-old girl was given an invasivepat down even after going through the full-body radiation scanner. TSAAdministrator, John Pistole, said that it was because the child had moved in thescanner. Pistole is just another bought-and-paid-for gofer who does and sayswhatever his masters tell him. It goes with the territory. Challenge thebehaviour of the TSA personnel in the United States and the police are called,or they make sure you miss your flight. You have to be punished for having theaudacity to question their power over you. They express their own sad need forpower over others by using the State’s power as if it was their own while allthe time the State is exposing them to radiation from the scanners in the fullknowledge that this is cumulatively killing them. A woman passing throughsecurity at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington D.C. was viciouslyattacked, thrown across the room into another passenger and a metal chair,beaten about the face and body and had her head slammed on a metal table causinga permanent traumatic brain injury. Her crime? She had a small container ofcontact lens solution. Put ‘Dr Phil Airport Assault’ into YouTube. It isextraordinary what happened. The TSA is being expanded into an American versionof the Nazi Gestapo or the East German Stasi to operate all over the country,and not only at airports. They are a major part of the domestic security forcethat Obama promised during his election campaigns when he well knew what thebloodlines funding him were demanding. Obama said that they couldn’t rely onlyon the military for national security: ‘We’ve got to have a civilian nationalsecurity force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.’The TSA has taken part in ‘exercises’ covering 5,000 miles and three states inassociation with other strands in the now vast web of American ‘security’(control) agencies."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00396.jpg] Figure 319: The Taser – weapon of choice for the Battle of Wounded Ego Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) You see the same TSA attitudes and behaviour when police officers are questionedby the public and out comes the Taser – 55,000 volts of electricity unleashed bya brain-donor with a wounded ego (Fig 319). Many people have been killed by this‘non-lethal’ weapon, and this suits the bloodlines because it increases fear ofthe police and makes people do whatever they are told. Tasers were supposed tobe used only by trained firearms officers in dangerous and life-threateningsituations. I said at the time that this wouldn’t last long, and now they arehanded out like confetti and constantly used when there is no danger to anyoneor anything except the ego of uniformed narcissists who are so pathetic(‘unconscious deficits in self-esteem’) that they can’t bear to have theirperceived omnipotence questioned. Put ‘Taser outrageous’ into YouTube. Police inDayton, Ohio, Tasered, pepper-sprayed and physically attacked mentallyhandicapped teenager, Jesse Kersey, and then charged him with assault. Hiscrime? The police officer, another narcissistic moron-for-hire called WillieHooper, ‘mistook’ the boy’s speech impediment as a sign of disrespect. WillieWonker, or something close, knew that the 17-year-old was mentally handicapped,but embarked on an extraordinary attack along with fellow moron, Officer JohnHoward. The teenager rode home on his bicycle because he could not understandwhat was being said to him when Willie Woodenhead had stopped him. The officerswent to the boy’s home and, as his mother opened the door, these thugs firedtheir Tasers hitting the boy in the back with two electrical probes. Jesse’smother told the court hearing the case: ‘Once inside the house, defendant Hooperand defendant Howard began to struggle with Jesse, who was standing against theback door with his hands up in front of his face, saying, “Please quit, pleasequit”. Officer Howard utilized his Cap-Stun pepper-spray and sprayed Jesse …[and] struck Jesse with a closed fist in the upper chest area.’ They’re realmen, see. Howard continued the beating and then Dumb and Dumber called forbackup and another 20 officers arrived at the house. Jesse was handcuffed, tiedup and thrown into a police car. This story would be shocking if it was only aone-off, but police brutality is now becoming the norm across the world andthose responsible are being selected, programmed and trained to act like this ina bloodline police state enforced by brainless thugs. There was the man inLoganville – ‘Where People Matter’ – in Georgia who called the police when hecame home to find that his stepson had committed suicide, and when they arrivedthey beat the living daylights out him while ambulance staff were trying torevive the boy. Ontario police in Canada are securing a gathering and deservedreputation for brutality, sexual assault and wrongful arrest. Sean Salvati wasarrested for saying: ‘Well, good luck on Saturday’ to officers preparing topolice the G20 summit in Toronto in 2010. ‘One of the officers grabbed my neckand began punching me,’ Salvati said. ‘[He] mentioned something about ‘These areyour rights’. You know? Like: “You think you have rights? These are yourrights”.’ Salvati was taken to the police station, stripped naked, paraded infront of officers – including a woman – and then locked, still naked, in a cage.You can see video of this story if you put these words into YouTube: ‘Cops StripSearch Man And Leave Him Naked For 10 Hours In Holding Cell’. A woman unlawfullyarrested in Ottawa, Ontario, was kicked and beaten by police officers, had hershirt and bra cut off and was left half-naked in a cell for three hours – theYouTube headline is ‘Ottawa Police Attack and Strip Search Innocent Woman’. Thestories of police brutality are now endless because of the specific ‘character’type being recruited – and how many others never come to public attention? Wehave seen nothing yet if we go on taking it. A lot of their arrogance andoutrageous behaviour comes from the fact that they know that the system willprotect them, because it wants them to behave like that. There will be noshortage of recruits for the guards in the concentration camps already waitingfor the ‘dissidents’. Concentration camps?? No, I am not kidding. See some of myother books, or put the words: ‘Concentration Camps, America’ into a searchengine. They are being installed in many countries and in the United States theyare the responsibility of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Mostpeople have no idea how far this has already gone. The police are looking evermore like soldiers and the plan is for a global army and police force toimplement the dictates of the world government structure as basically one unit.The British government of David Cameron (Rothschild Zionist) is even talkingabout appointing military officers and Intelligence personnel to the highestranks of the police to establish an ‘officer class’ in local forces. The USgovernment is supplying police departments with military uniforms, weapons,vehicles (in some cases, including tanks) and training. There are 40,000paramilitary raids on American property every year by Special Weapons andTactics (SWAT) teams, for which a brain is not essential (Fig 320[../Text/index_split_188.html#filepos1392121]). A SWAT team threw a flashgrenade through the window of a home in Detroit in 2010 while a seven-year-oldgirl was watching television with her grandmother. The grenade burned the littlegirl’s blanket and the SWAT team then raided the house and shot the child dead.The suspect they were after didn’t even live there. They got the wrongapartment. Police in Oakland County, Michigan, raided a medical marijuanadispensary with guns drawn, bulletproof vests and at least one with a mask. Theydidn’t arrest anyone, just cleaned the place out of all cash – including thepersonal money of staff and patients. Michigan’s asset forfeiture law means that80 per cent of the cash the deputies stole will go to the Oakland CountySheriff’s Department and the local prosecutor gets the other 20 per cent. It isarmed robbery, nothing less. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 bans the use of themilitary for civilian policing, and to get around that we have people dressed assoldiers, armed like soldiers and acting like soldiers – but they are called‘police’. They are also using real troops in contravention of the act more andmore, in a creep to fully militarise control of the United States. Troops havebeen arresting people in Florida and it will be happening elsewhere, too. ThePentagon announced plans in 2008 to deploy 20,000 troops on duties inside theUnited States and have them trained by 2011. Martial law is coming unless vastnumbers of people wake up and get active. Police are also being exposed evermore often for dressing up as protestors at peaceful demonstrations and engagingin violence that gives their fellow officers the excuse to move in and batterpeople who are only protesting peacefully. This includes smashing shop windowsand burning police cars to discredit peaceful protests. Canadian police havebeen caught doing this many times, and at the Security and ProsperityPartnership of North America (North American Union) summit in Quebec in 2007their agents provocateurs were filmed wearing exactly the same boots as thepolice. I should cancel that application for the undercover squad, chaps. Thisis happening at peaceful protests all over the world. British police do this asa matter of course at major demonstrations. Can you imagine the scale ofcharacter defects necessary to try to discredit people peacefully campaigningfor justice by staging violence? How they can look their children in the eyes isbeyond me, but I’m sure they have no problem."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00397.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00398.jpg]Figure 320: A SWAT team and the Keystone Cops. Spot the difference? Take theguns away and me neither HOW MUCH MORE WILL WE TAKE?The level of surveillance is already extraordinary, as I said it would be in myearlier books when people were still laughing at the very suggestion. We havesurveillance cameras everywhere, and anyone walking around a town or city inBritain, going in and out of shops and other buildings, will be seen by morethan 300 cameras every day. There are cameras all over the road systems thatwere said to be there to stop speeding, but they record your number plate as youpass. The little town of Royston, in Hertfordshire, England, which has a lowlevel of crime, has had police cameras installed on every road leading in andout to record the number plate of every vehicle. The system then checks theseagainst a whole bank of databases. This is what they are planning foreverywhere. We are watched by the satellite network in ways that we wouldn’tbelieve possible. British police have introduced radio-controlled flyingsurveillance cameras – the same as those portrayed in the film, They Live,released in 1988. This has all been planned for decades and more. We haveface-recognition cameras, iris scanning, full-body radiation scanning and DNAdatabases. They want everyone’s DNA on file for many reasons, and one is that itallows them to access the unique frequency of every individual, and people canthen be targeted directly on their specific frequency. There are many scams andlaws going on to get DNA samples. I saw a project in South Africa whereschoolchildren were being asked to give hair samples, saliva and fingerprintsfor something called ‘Ident-A-Kid’. The scheme is sold as something that wouldhelp police find missing children and I am sure there are some genuine peopleinvolved but there is always an ulterior motive with these projects. Britishpolice now take and keep DNA from everyone arrested, even when they are found tobe innocent. It’s just another disingenuous scam to build the database. London’sHeathrow Airport announced that it was introducing biometric facial-recognitioncameras to ‘identify terrorists’. Yawn. The International Criminal PoliceOrganization (Interpol) wants to add a facial recognition database to the onesthat it has for DNA and fingerprints. Interpol’s multi-faceted databases areplanned to retain the records of everyone who has travelled through virtuallyany airport worldwide. Other plans are for a camera in every aircraft seat to‘identify terrorists and other dangers to passengers’ – better fit them to theWhite House, National Security Agency, British Intelligence and Mossadheadquarters if they want people to be safe. They also want them on cigarettevending machines (‘to stop underage smoking’), at supermarket checkouts (‘tostop underage drinking’) and at bus and train stations to ‘replace tickets’.Tokyo police are asking homeowners to install these cameras on their propertiesfor purposes of ‘stopping terrorism and crime’. Many idiots will, too.Surveillance now includes microchip tags on products that we buy; monitoring ofmobile phones, credit card transactions and store ‘loyalty’ cards;phone-tapping; hidden cameras and bugs; and Internet cookies. There are‘keystroke’ programmes that record the keys that you hit on your computer andthis gives them passwords and encryption codes. Keystroke can also be used tomonitor work rates for computer operators in the openly slave world that isplanned. They want to impose compulsory employment with no right to strike, andthis is the real reason for moves to make trade unions impotent. This hashappened most famously in Wisconsin where thousands of workers occupied thestate’s Capitol building in protest in part at draconian trade union lawsproposed by the appalling Governor Scott Walker that would end collectivebargaining. The United States and the European Union have agreed a scheme toallow check-in data, including credit card details, of all transatlantic flightsto be stored for 15 years. Even EU lawyers say that this is illegal under dataprotection laws, as confirmed by documents passed to London’s The Guardian. Thelegal opinion said that allowing US Homeland Security to store personal check-indata was ‘not compatible with fundamental rights’; but why would that bother themanipulators when they want to take away fundamental rights? The US Departmentof Homeland Security even announced in 2011 that it believes terrorists intendto bypass the full-body scanners by implanting devices inside people – so-called‘belly bombs’. It gets ever more insane. What next, surgical operations beforeyou board your flight? Here is the key line in one report: ‘Officials claim thatfull-body scanners currently being used in airports would not penetrate deepenough to detect such devices.’ Oh well, we’d better give every passenger afull-blown X-ray, then, and really zap them with radiation. They’re not dyingquick enough, see. Technology is being employed to identify faces in crowds and‘suspicious behaviour patterns’, with ‘lie detectors’ being planned forairports. We can be monitored and tracked 24 hours a day and in ways that wedon’t even know about, with technology supplied by the Reptilian Alliance thatmost people would not believe possible. They have introduced technology toidentify people by their brain patterns and heart rhythms; and a ‘sensing seat’fitted to trucks can record each driver’s characteristic seated posture ‘in anattempt to spot whether commercial vehicles had been hijacked’. This all comesunder the heading of ‘Humabio’, or ‘Human Monitoring and Authentication usingBiodynamic Indicators and Behavioural Analysis’. American Homeland Security isdeveloping technology called the Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST)designed to identify people intending to commit a crime or terrorist act. FASTmonitors heart rate, tone of voice, a person’s ‘gaze’, body temperature and soon, and can create checkpoints, or ‘security boundaries’ anywhere, including atsporting events and airports. This is the concept of ‘pre-crime’ technologyportrayed in the Tom Cruise film, Minority Report. Hollywood is in the controlof the bloodlines through the Rothschild Zionists and they are conditioning thepublic to accept the agenda. Steven Aftergood, a senior research analyst at theFederation of American Scientists, is not impressed with FAST and believes itwill produce a lot of ‘false positives’ to mark innocent people as potentialterrorists. I’m sure he’s right, but they don’t give a damn so long as it addsto the ever-growing tapestry of multi-levelled control and intimidation. Thedarkest of dark US National Security Agency, the boss of the CIA, awarded aclassified $100 million contract to the Illuminati ‘defence’ giant, Raytheon, tointroduce something called ‘Perfect Citizen’. Raytheon is the company that onceowned the patents for HAARP. Perfect Citizen would use secret technology tomonitor Internet communications. The Wall Street Journal quoted a Raytheon emailas saying that ‘Perfect Citizen is Big Brother’. Telephone calls, emails andfaxes are being monitored by the Echelon spy network which scans for key wordsand voice-recognition patterns at establishments like the deeply sinisterMenwith Hill in North Yorkshire, England. This is a ground base for satellitesoperated by the US National Reconnaissance Office and it is run by the USNational Security Agency (NSA) on British soil. I am told that Menwith Hill hada role in the attacks of 9/11. Washington journalist, Bill Blum, who extensivelyresearched Echelon, describes it as a network of massive, highly-automatedinterception stations which is eavesdropping on the entire world. He said: ‘Likea mammoth vacuum cleaner in the sky, the National Security Agency (NSA) sucks itall up: home phone, office phone, cellular phone, email, fax, telex … satellitetransmissions, fibre-optic communications traffic, microwave links, voice, textimages [which are] captured by satellites continuously orbiting the Earth andthen processed by high-powered computers.’ Blum said that Echelon surveillancespied on political leaders, the United Nations, the Pope and groups like AmnestyInternational. Confidential business information is also being stolen this wayand passed to bloodline corporations. ‘If God has a phone, it’s beingmonitored,’ he said. Other Echelon centres are at Morwenstow (Cornwall, UK); theAustralian Defence Satellite Communications Station (Geraldton, WesternAustralia); Misawa Air Base (Japan); Pine Gap (near Alice Springs, NorthernTerritory, Australia); Sabana Seca (Puerto Rico, US); Sugar Grove (WestVirginia, US); Yakima (Washington, US); and Waihopai (New Zealand). Statewatch,an organisation tracking the assault on civil liberties in Europe, said this: > Across the EU, governments have, or are, adopting national laws for the> mandatory retention of everyone’s communications data – all forms of> communication (phone calls, faxes, mobile calls including locations) which> will be extended to keeping a record of all internet usage from 2009 – even> though few are aware this is happening.

This was written a few years ago, and it is far more advanced now. The EuropeanUnion took this on to a still more extreme stage when it announced a newsurveillance system that would monitor data taken from countless sources throughthe continuous monitoring of ‘websites, discussion forums, Usenet groups, fileservers, P2P networks [and] individual computer systems’. This information isplanned to be collated and assessed by the giant computer system to detect‘abnormal behaviour’. The system is called ‘Project Indect’ and will be used bya European Union police force and the EU equivalent of the CIA. Internetproviders have to record our surfing activity and provide this information toMI5 as a result of Tony Blair’s Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. TheRothschild Zionist-controlled Yahoo, the world’s largest email provider, haseven included in its updated terms and conditions, or Additional Terms ofService, that they have the right to scan private emails. They also make it thecustomers’ responsibility to tell non-Yahoo correspondents that their emails arebeing scanned. The US Patriot Act co-authored by Michael ‘body scanner’ Chertoff(Rothschild Zionist) has deleted many basic freedoms in the United States.‘Anti-terrorist’ (anti-people) legislation means that Americans can now havetheir citizenship removed, go to jail without trial, and be flown to anothercountry to be tortured and even executed in secret. These Acts are examples ofthe Totalitarian Tiptoe in that the legislation is sold and passed on the basisof targeting ‘terrorists’, but the wording allows them to apply it, as planned,to the domestic population. I said at the time that ‘anti-terrorism’ laws werenot aimed at terrorists. The people introducing them are the terrorists.Anti-terrorism laws are actually anti-people laws and now the truth of that isthere for all to see. Fascism has reached the point in the United States whereObama has demanded the right to declare war whenever he likes and order anyAmerican citizen to be assassinated, with no charge or trial, on the basis ofthe ‘Intelligence and military community’ (read bloodlines) saying that they areterrorists. No evidence necessary. Admiral Dennis Blair, Obama’s Director ofNational Intelligence, acknowledged in Congressional testimony that they reservethe ‘right’ to assassinate Americans. The Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagoncompile a hit-list for the presidential assassination programme, and when thepresident gives the nod the American population is reduced by one. This is onlywhere they have reached in their agenda this far. Imagine where they want to gofrom here. All this is happening to ‘stop terrorism’. But how many people doesterrorism actually kill? Take away those who die in El-ite-staged terrorism like9/11, and what is left? Virtually nothing compared, for instance, with thefantastic numbers who die every year in America alone from taking prescribedpharmaceutical drugs; or the millions killed by the bombs of those who say wemust ‘stop terrorism’. The ‘War on Terror’ is all a gigantic hoax.TARGETING THE INTERNETThe right to free speech and free association is being shredded by the day. Wenow have ‘free speech zones’ well away from the people in power that the ‘freespeech’ is aimed at, and the right to free expression and protest at all will bebanned if they get their way (Fig 321). A mountain of so-called ‘hate laws’ isbeing introduced to silence anyone exposing the Rothschild Zionists. These arenothing to do with protecting minorities and everything to do with protectingthe bloodlines from exposure. The Hidden Hand is now moving in on the Internet.The World Wide Web is a bloodline creation and has endless benefits for them inthat it makes tracking communications and gathering personal information child’splay. Did you know that anything you post on Rothschild-Zionist Facebook becomestheir property? When you sign up you grant Facebook the following:image [../Images/00399.jpg] Figure 321: Use it or lose it > An irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide> license (with the right to sublicense) to (a) use, copy, publish, stream,> store, retain, publicly perform or display, transmit, scan, reformat, modify,> edit, frame, translate, excerpt, adapt, create derivative works and distribute> (through multiple tiers), any User Content you (i) Post on or in connection> with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof subject only to your> privacy settings or (ii) enable a user to Post, including by offering a Share> Link on your website and (b) to use your name, likeness and image for any> purpose, including commercial or advertising, each of (a) and (b) on or in> connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof. Social networking sites are a Rothschild Zionist scam to glean information aboutpeople and seize ownership of their photographs, text and creativity. The USFederal Trade Commission has approved a company called Social IntelligenceCorporation that performs background checks on job applicants by searchingsocial media accounts and retains what it finds for seven years. Everything yousay and do on these sites can be used against you years later. Nor does itmatter if you use anonymous names. Social Intelligence Corporation employssoftware that links nicknames with real names. These lovely people also scourvideo and picture sharing sites, blogs, eBay, Craiglist and Wikipedia entries.The Internet is also a technological collective mind that can manipulatepeople’s sense of reality. There is so much going on while we are on theInternet that we have no idea about. Susan Greenfield from Oxford Universitysays that the Internet is re-moulding brains to rely on ‘associative thinking’which makes people unable to read and write at length. She warned thatnetworking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are giving people ‘a lobotomy ofempathy’. She said her fear was that ‘these technologies are infantilizing thebrain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises andbright lights, who have a small attention span and who live for the moment’.Real conversation may give way to sanitized screen dialogues, she said, and formany it already has. American technologist Nicholas Carr wondered in an articlefor Atlantic Magazine if the Net is remapping neural-circuitry and reprogrammingthe memory. He said his friends told him that they could no longer absorbinformation delivered at length. Carr’s article was headed: ‘Is Google Making UsStupid?’ So there are many benefits for the bloodlines from the Internet andthis is why they created it. But there is one big downside for them. TheInternet has allowed for the global communication of information about theconspiracy which would not have been even nearly possible had it not existed.The bloodlines are now manoeuvring to block that flow of information by using anumber of excuses, including, of course, the threat of terrorism. They will havetheir Problem–Reaction–Solutions waiting in the wings to justify Internetcensorship and this will be aimed at people like me, US radio hosts Jeff Renseand Alex Jones, and a great swathe of Internet researchers that have appeared insuch large numbers since 9/11 (Fig 322[../Text/index_split_190.html#filepos1414438]). The Department of HomelandSecurity (DHS) has been shutting down websites for simply linking to sitesaccused of copyright infringements. Copyright infringement is another frontlinepretext being used to remove websites that the bloodlines wish to delete. Thereare reports that the Rothschild-Zionist-controlled entertainment industryhas’convinced’ corporations including Comcast and AT&T to impose a‘three-strikes rule’ on people accused of streaming or downloading files allegedto be subject to copyright. The reports say that after the third ‘strike’,Internet access would be reduced or deleted. I don’t think that corporationssuch as Comcast and AT&T would take much convincing given that they answer tothe same masters as the entertainment industry. The US Department of HomelandSecurity suspended 84,000 websites ‘by mistake’ in a trawl supposedly aimed atstopping the commnunication of child pornography. There are a list of famousnames in political power I could give them if they are serious about stoppingthe sexual abuse of children; but, of course, they’re not. Serial child abusersand killers in power are using the excuse of child pornography to censor theInternet. Ed Vaizey, the UK Minister for Culture, Communications and CreativeIndustries, is meeting with copyright lobbyists to discuss plans to censor theInternet. They want to establish ‘expert bodies’ to decide which websites wereallowed and which were not. A judge would make the decision in a ‘streamlinedprocedure’ to allow for sites to be quickly shut down. The Digital Economy Actincludes the power to remove websites, and this was due to a proposal by LiberalDemocrats (the ‘freedom’ party) in the House of Lords that was written bylobbyists for the music industry. Danish police have asked the government forlaws to ban anonymous use of the Internet; and Facebook’s Randi Zuckerberg(Rothschild Zionist), sister of founder Mark Zuckerberg (Rothschild Zionist),has called for all Internet anonymity to end. Google CEO Eric Schmidt(Rothschild Zionist) agrees. He has said that Internet anonymity was a‘dangerous’ precedent and ‘predicted’ (he knows) that governments would bringabout its demise. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agencyannounced in 2011 that it was targeting overseas websites for breaching UScopyright and would seek to extradite people to stand trial in America. ErikBarnett, the agency’s assistant deputy director, outrageously claimed the rightto do this because all ‘dot com’ and ‘dot org’ domains have all theirconnections routed through VeriSign, an Internet infrastructure company based inVirginia. He said that this was sufficient to seek a US prosecution. This alsomeans that the American government (Rothschilds) could block all of thosewebsites whenever it wants."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00400.jpg] Figure 322: Rothschild Zionist Internet censorship Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) THE USUAL SUSPECTSThe White House released a 52-page document in May 2001 that makes theDepartment of Homeland Security the ‘lead agency’ for implementing Internet‘countermeasures’. A ‘countermeasure’ can be defined in translated Orwell-speakas: ‘We can do what we bloody like.’ Legislation is worded in ways that can beso widely interpreted that a simple ‘we can do what we like’ would save a wholelot of trees. The pressure for Internet censorship in America is coming frombloodline sources such as ‘shapeshifter’ Jay Rockefeller (Rothschild Zionist),Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation; andJoe Lieberman (Rothschild Zionist), Chairman of the Committee on HomelandSecurity and Governmental Affairs. Jay Rockefeller is the great-grandson of thetruly evil J D Rockefeller, and was the force behind the Cybersecurity Act of2009. This allows the president to ‘declare a cybersecurity emergency’ wheneverhe chooses and to either close down or restrict any information network ‘in theinterest of national security’. They plan to do just this in the final stages oftheir planned takeover, or when it is vital for them to stop informationreaching the public to expose what they are doing. Rothschild gofer PeterMandelson (Rothschild Zionist) targeted Internet freedom in Britain in the lastLabour government from his position as Svengali to prime ministers Tony Blairand Gordon Brown. Another Internet censor is the French President NicolasSarkozy (Rothschild Zionist), who hosted an event at the G8 summit in 2011topress for just that. He said that the Internet must have ‘values’ and ‘rules’ –his ‘values’ and his ‘rules’. Among those attending the event in Paris wereGoogle executive chairman, Eric Schmidt (Rothschild Zionist); Facebook founder,Mark Zuckerberg (Rothschild Zionist); and media tycoon, Rupert Murdoch(Rothschild Zionist). You can see the pattern as bloodline gofers sing for theirsupper. Bill ‘I did not have sexual relations with that woman’ Clinton has beenwheeled out to do the honours. This man, who knowingly lied (he never knowinglytells the truth) to the nation on live television at the height of the MonicaLewinsky scandal, called in 2011 for the creation of an Orwellian Internet‘Ministry of Truth’-style organisation that would be run by the federalgovernment or the UN. This would address ‘misinformation and rumours floating onthe Internet’. In other words, target the people telling the truth about the mobthat Clinton answers to. Right okay, Bill, try this: You and yourcover-story-on-the-arm wife are responsible for decades of horrors that havemaimed and murdered multi-millions worldwide and destroyed the lives of evenmore. What happened to the two young boys found dead on the railroad track nearthe Mena Airstrip in Arkansas where you were – in league with the Bush familyand others – running drugs as part of Iran–Contra and other deals? What happenedto the people who died or went missing because they had information that wouldhave destroyed your political career? And what really happened to Vince Fosterwho knew symbolically and literally where the bodies were buried, and who wasmurdered in the most plainly-staged ‘suicide’ you could imagine. Shall I go on,Slick Will? I could do for days. Put that through your ‘Ministry of Truth’, MrSniff, Sniff. You are just another pathetic gofer licking the backsides of themasters that have controlled you all your life.‘Go and call for a Ministry of Truth, Clinton, the Internet is a danger to ourplans.’‘Yessir, master, anything you say, master.’Drink your milk, Bill, it’s time for bed.(You will find the detailed background to the Clinton stories listed above in …And the Truth Shall Set You Free.)CHIPS WITH EVERYTHINGThe Big Brother technology they are drooling over the most is the microchip (Fig323 [../Text/index_split_191.html#filepos1422743]). I was told about this planby a ‘patched’ CIA scientist in 1997. The term ‘patched’ refers to a see-throughsachet on the skin containing a drug which reluctant servants of the bloodlinesare manipulated to need in order to survive. The scientist showed me his patchwhen I asked why he was using his scientific abilities to serve an agenda thatdisgusted him. He said that he joined the CIA thinking he was serving hiscountry, but then realised that the conspiracy I am exposing was real. Herefused to work for them after his technology – designed to stimulate rapidplant growth with electromagnetic fields – was used to kill a large group ofEthiopians during a famine. Elements within the CIA realised that the technologycould be used as a mass-killer through directed electromagnetism. They put theword out among starving Ethiopians that food would be dropped at a certainlocation and they flew over the crowd and unleashed the deadly electromagneticfield. The scientist was in the back of the plane believing this to be anexperiment to stimulate crop growth in deserts. He walked to the front of theplane and looked through the window after the technology was activated, and allhe could see was dead bodies. He left his home one day, soon after he’d walkedout on the CIA, and he remembers nothing until he woke up in a room and realisedthat something was stuck to his chest – the ‘patch’. He opened his shirt when Imet him and showed me the sachet containing an orangey-gold liquid. The patchneeds to be replaced every 72 hours or he will start to die a very horribledeath. He knows this is true, because he tried it. If he doesn’t obey orders,the patch is not replaced. He told me there were thousands of ‘patched’ peopleworking in secret projects against their will; and if you think this is evilbeyond words then read some of my other books where I go into everything ingreat detail. These people are insane. The scientist told me about the humanmicrochipping agenda and he said this was about far more than merely electronictagging and surveillance. He said that this was part of it, of course, and thechips would send signals to a computer system; but even more important were thesignals coming the other way from the computers to the chip. He said that thiswould allow people to be manipulated mentally, emotionally and ‘physically’,either individually or en masse, and for anyone to be killed whenever they choseby sending information to the chip. The human body is a biological computer andthey know that. The chip would act as a receiver for information to destabilise– even kill – as many people as they want. Think what an internal microchipcould do to DNA receiver–transmitters. Quite a weapon for crazies with adepopulation agenda."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00401.jpg] Figure 323: Accept the microchip and it’s goodbye freedom in every sense We already have people being chipped so they can interact with computers throughmind instructions alone; and look how television companies can add a new channelby sending signals to the card in your television box while you are still on thephone placing the order. Scientists at the University of Southern Californiaannounced in 2011 that they have developed a chip that controls brain activityand stores long-term memories. These can be downloaded and transferred to otherbrains implanted with the chip. This would also allow chipped people to havetheir thoughts, memories and knowledge accessed by the authorities. We are trulyin the realms of George Orwell’s Thought Police when even our thoughts become acriminal offence. This has been the plan all along and Orwell knew about whatwas coming through his connections with the Fabian Society and others. TheUniversity of Southern California where this chip is being developed is thelocation of the Department of Homeland Security National Center for Risk andEconomic Analysis of Terrorism Events. The CIA scientist told me in 1997 thatmicrochips developed in the secret projects were already so small that theycould be inserted by hypodermic needles in vaccination programmes. Today we callwhat he was talking about ‘nanotechnology’. This is so small that the human eyecan’t even come close to seeing it. Hitachi unveiled a tiny new ‘powder’ chipmeasuring 0.05 × 0.05 mm. What we see in the public arena is not the cuttingedge, either. Far more advanced technology is waiting to be revealed in thesecret projects. We have been prepared for human microchipping by the chippingof animals (which many studies have connected with animal cancers). This wasvoluntary initially, but that is changing. The same Totalitarian Tiptoetechnique is planned for humans. Inside-the-body microchips are being promotedfor a variety of uses including the storing of medical records in case you havean accident or are taken ill; and chipping children and people with dementia sothey can be found if they go missing. A New Jersey orthopaedic surgeon wants toadd a microchip to joint implants that would emit a unique wavelength that couldtravel through human tissue. The data would be decoded and displayed on acomputer screen. I am sure an artificial wavelength resonating inside the bodywill be very good for your health. One of the stepping-stones or TotalitarianTiptoes to the fully-fledged microchip are ‘electronic tattoos’ – micro-thinelectrical circuits attached to the skin to monitor a person’s heart rate andother vital signs with the potential for much more. The creators say that the‘tattoo’, or ‘epidermal electronics system’ (EES), ‘eliminates the distinctionbetween electronics and biology’. In so many ways, they are the same thing,anyway. The ‘tattoos’ can transmit all kinds of information to those with thetechnology to decode it – and receive information sent the other way (but theydon’t shout about that bit). Big Brother ‘Intelligence’ goons must be rubbingtheir hands with glee. Clothing and other products are increasingly beingproduced with communication chips.The late Aaron Russo, the award-winning film producer who produced TradingPlaces with Eddie Murphy, began to alert people to the conspiracy in the yearsbefore he died. He said publicly in 2007 that a member of the Rockefellerfamily, Nick Rockefeller, had told him about the plan for mass microchipping(Fig 324). This happened during a conversation in which Rockefeller attempted torecruit Russo for the Council on Foreign Relations. Rockefeller told him thatthe goal was to mass-microchip what he called the ‘serfs’ and to have bankersand the rest of the El-ite control the world. He said that if Russo joined themhis chip would be specially coded to avoid unnecessary inspection by theauthorities. Rockefeller said to Russo, almost a year before 9/11, that therewas going to be an event that would lead to the invasion of Afghanistan to runpipelines through to the Caspian Sea. They were going to invade Iraq to takeover the oil fields and establish a base in the Middle East, and ‘go afterChávez in Venezuela’. As I write, Hugo Chávez has had a tumour removed and isundergoing chemotherapy. Rockefeller said that Russo would see soldiers lookingin caves in Afghanistan and Pakistan for Osama bin Laden. There would be an‘endless war on terror where there’s no real enemy’, and the whole thing wouldbe a ‘giant hoax’. This would allow the government to take over the Americanpeople, Rockefeller told him as he cynically laughed and joked. Russo saidRockefeller constantly stressed that ‘the people have to be ruled’ and thepopulation reduced by at least half. Rockefeller also revealed that theRockefeller Foundation had created and funded the women’s liberation movement todestroy the family. The plan was aimed at getting children into school at anearlier age and indoctrinating them to accept the State as their primary family(straight from the pages of Huxley’s Brave New World). He said that anotherreason for creating and funding the ‘women’s lib’ movement was because beforethen the bankers couldn’t tax half of the population. Nick Rockefeller operatesout of China plotting with the Chinese Reptilian hybrids for their massive rolein what is planned. There is a whole army of computer hackers in China primed totarget US and other government computer-systems to justify censorship andinformation-blocking technology on the Internet.image [../Images/00402.jpg] Figure 324: Aaron Russo and Nick Rockefeller before Rockefeller revealed thegame plan "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00403.jpg] Figure 325: I know, let’s put poison in the water supply. Yeah, that’s a goodidea Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) FROM ALL ANGLESEverything that I am exposing in this book is connected, and the dot-connectingtheme is the suppression and control of humanity. The bloodlines are not puttingsodium fluoride in public drinking-water supplies and toothpaste to protectpeople from tooth decay – it doesn’t. They do this because fluoride is a brainsuppressant (Fig 325). I have been saying this in my books for two decades andnow this fact is being confirmed even by some in the scientific mainstream. Apublication of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,Environmental Health Perspectives, published a study revealing that fluoride isalready reducing the intelligence of children. More than 500 children, agedbetween eight and thirteen, were tested in two Chinese villages with high andlow levels of fluoride in the water. They found that 28 per cent of children inthe low-fluoride village had bright, normal or higher intelligence, but thefigure was only eight per cent in the high-fluoride community. Paul Connett PhD,director of the Fluoride Action Network, said: > This is the 24th study that has found this association, but this study is> stronger than the rest because the authors have controlled for key confounding> variables and in addition to correlating lowered IQ with levels of fluoride in> the water, the authors found a correlation between lowered IQ and fluoride> levels in children’s blood. This brings us closer to a cause and effect> relationship between fluoride exposure and brain damage in children. > What is also striking is that the levels of the fluoride in the community> where the lowered IQs were recorded were lower than the [Environmental> Protection Agency’s] so-called ‘safe’ drinking water standard for fluoride of> 4 ppm and far too close for comfort to the levels used in artificial> fluoridation programs (0.7 – 1.2 ppm). image [../Images/00404.jpg] Figure 326: Fluoride is good for teeth The ‘safe’ levels they claim for everything, be it fluoride, radiation orwhatever, are not ‘safe’ at all and they know it. You will see from what youhave read so far that the bloodlines are not interested in ‘safe’ levels ofanything – it’s the dangerous levels they want. They pick a dangerous level andcall it safe and then whenever you challenge something for its effect on peoplethe authorities say ‘it is within officially agreed safety limits’. But agreedby whom? Precisely. The false ‘safe’ levels originate with the bloodlinenetworks, and employees of governments and their agencies are told that this isthe policy they must sell and implement. Most of them haven’t a clue where thepolicy came from or the motivation behind it. Sodium fluoride was added to thedrinking water in the Nazi concentration camps to keep the inmates docile. It isa waste product of the aluminium and phosphate industry and an ingredient in:the mind-altering drug, Prozac, and other hypnotic and psychiatric drugs; Sarinnerve gas; rat and cockroach poisons; and anaesthetic. Fluoride causes cancer,genetic damage, Alzheimer’s and calcification of the pineal gland (associatedwith psychic ability – exactly what the bloodlines and the Reptilian Alliancewant to block to entrap people in purely five-sense awareness). Fluoride is alsoin almost all toothpastes based on the lie (see: global warming, 9/11 and allthe rest) that it prevents tooth decay. But it doesn’t, and I tell the detailedstory of this scam in others books. Fluoride is actually terrible for teeth asthe soaring levels of fluorosis can confirm (Fig 326). Communities have votedagainst having fluoride added to their water, but it has still gone ahead. Astudy published in the journal Neurologia in 2011 confirmed what other reportshave detailed: Fluoride added to drinking water can cause serious brain andother damage. The report said: > The prolonged ingestion of fluoride may cause significant damage to health and> particularly the nervous system. Fluoride is capable of crossing the> blood-brain barrier, which may cause biochemical and functional changes in the> nervous system during pregnancy, since the fluoride accumulates in brain> tissue before birth. Now they are manoeuvring to add mind-altering lithium to drinking water to makepeople docile and good little slaves by publishing ‘research’ that it reducessuicide rates. One of the advocates for this is Dr Jacob Appel (RothschildZionist) at Mount Sinai (Moon-god Mountain) Hospital in New York. Appel told themedia that the latest studies provided ‘compelling’ evidence of the ‘moodstabilising’ benefits of lithium. ‘The theory is that lithium in trace amountsenhances the connectivity among neurons, and having exposure over a lifetimemakes the brain more happy,’ he said. Make them love their servitude. Appel saidthat it would be relatively easy to add lithium, which is a naturally occurringelement: ‘People who oppose adding lithium to the drinking water in traceamounts don’t go around advocating to strain the lithium from the drinking waterfrom areas where it does exist. Why not give everyone the same benefit?’ Oh,please, darling. Cue song sheet, cue Appel. Another major promoter of lithium indrinking water is Dr Gerhard Schauzer (Rothschild Zionist) at the University ofCalifornia. These people are an open book when you know what is really going on.The widely-used artificial sweetener aspartame is another brain suppressant andit was manipulated through the US government testing procedure by 9/11 USDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld (Rothschild Zionist) when he was chiefexecutive, president and chairman of Big Pharma’s G D Searle & Company. Rumsfeldwas a member of the Rothschild Zionist Project for the New American Centurywhich called for ‘advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specificgenotypes …’ Searle sold aspartame to Monsanto, who gave the world Agent Orangeand genetically-modified food. Enjoy your tea. Two aspartames, please. Watch forit in the lists of ingredients under its own name or ‘E951’. Aspartametrade-names include Nutrasweet, Equal and Spoonful.KILLING THE CHILDRENI have exposed vaccines at great length for the way their cocktail of poisons,including mercury, target the immune system to undermine our natural defences(Fig 327 [../Text/index_split_193.html#filepos1439633]). Children are now havingthe best part of 30 vaccinations, and combinations of them, by the age of two(Fig 328 [../Text/index_split_194.html#filepos1440137]). What does anyone with asmear of intelligence think this is doing to a still-developing immune system? Achild’s immune defences will never be what they should be after this bombardmentof toxins at such a crucial time. But that’s the idea, and the vaccinationprogramme is being orchestrated through the bloodlines’ Big Pharma cartel andthe Rothschild–Rockefeller-created World Health Organization. Vaccines are alsodesigned to change human DNA – another common theme. We don’t need uselessvaccines; we need a strong immune system which is being fundamentally underminedby vaccines, by additives in food and drink, and from electromagnetic sources.Who owns the Big Pharma cartel of interconnecting pharmaceutical corporations?The bloodlines do. And their drugs and vaccinations are produced for our benefitand to keep us healthy?? Did I mention depopulation? A report in the Human andExperimental Toxicology journal revealed a link between vaccinations and infantmortality. Highly experienced medical researchers, Neil Z Miller and Gary SGoldman, found ‘a high statistically significant correlation between increasingnumber of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates’. The UnitedStates vaccinates more children than any other country in the developed worldand has the highest number of infant deaths. Japan and Sweden, where childrenhave the fewest vaccinations, have the lowest rates. The polio vaccine given tochildren since the 1950s was found to contain a cancer causing agent – a virusknown as SV40. This was found in kidney cells of rhesus monkeys that are used tomake the vaccine, but they kept on giving it to children. A report in the SanFrancisco Chronicle in 2001 said:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00405.jpg] Figure 327: Hey, immune system, I’m comin’ for ya!

The American Childhood Cancer Association says that cancer is now the number onekiller of children in America. This is shocking to us, but good news for thebloodlines and Big Pharma in their depopulation programme. The Bill and BelindaGates Foundation donates billions of dollars for mass vaccination in the ThirdWorld with a big chunk of that provided by bloodline billionaire Warren Buffett.Gates has said that he wants to see every child in the world vaccinated in aprogramme that he calls ‘vaccine equity’. He disingenuously tries to sell thisnightmare as the ‘good guy’ ensuring that poor children have what ‘rich kids’have – toxins inserted with a needle: ‘It’s now that we’re gonna start to getthe last two vaccines that rich kids take for granted, the pneumococcal androtavirus, and over these next five years, get them out to every childeverywhere – that means for the first time ever that we have equity invaccines.’ Hey, that’s great. What about equity in food supply, homes, cleanwater, opportunity? Silence. But poisons? Oh yes, we need ‘equity’. Gates hasbeen extremely active in his promotion of the ‘global warming’ lie, too; and theAfrican Centre for Biosafety claims that Water Efficient Maize for Africa(WEMA), funded into existence by Gates and Buffett, is threatening Africa’s foodsovereignty and opening new markets for agribusiness giants like Monsanto. Whois ‘participating’ in the Gates–Buffett WEMA scheme? Monsanto. Gates says thatbiotechnology and genetically-modified crops are needed to feed the world’spopulation (which he wants to dramatically reduce). It seems that anything thebloodlines want, so does Bill Gates, and the world would be a much safer placeif he stuck to making billions from computer software. Gates attended afund-raising conference in London in June 2011 organised by the Global Alliancefor Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation isGAVI’s main source of funding, but British Prime Minister David Cameron(Rothschild Zionist) also pledged £814 million from British taxpayers forvaccinating children in poor countries (Fig 329[../Text/index_split_195.html#filepos1444179]). Cameron said that the moneywould help to vaccinate more than 80 million children, and save 1.4 millionlives. He said: > That is one child vaccinated every two seconds for five years. It is one> child’s life saved every two minutes. That is what the money that the British> taxpayer is putting in will give. "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00407.jpg] Figure 329: Global genocide Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) Cameron’s controllers have a mass depopulation programme. Why would they want tosave the lives of poor children if what Cameron and Gates claim is true? GAVI isan ‘alliance’ of some familiar names … the World Health Organization (WHO);United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF); World Bank Group; Bill and MelindaGates Foundation; governments of donor countries; governments of developingcountries; vaccine industry of developing countries and industrialisedcountries; research and technical health institutes; civil societyorganisations; and ‘independent individuals’. Yep, I’m sure there are lots of‘independent individuals’. GAVI was established in 2000 at the annual meeting ofthe World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This is like a moreon-the-record version of the Bilderberg Group involving the same people … youknow, the ones who want to see the population massively reduced. The Forum wasfounded in 1971 by the German economist Klaus Martin Schwab. Another chapconnected to the World Economic Forum is Konrad Otto-Zimmermann (RothschildZionist), president of the Agenda 21 Local Governments for Sustainability(control and depopulation). Zimmermann’s operation is supported by the WorldEconomic Forum and so is the Smart Grid mind-control system that deliversradiation and subliminal messages into every home. Bill Gates (Bilderberg Group)met with the Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg (Bilderberg Group) in2011, and soon afterwards it was announced that Norway would double its donationto supply vaccines in GAVI’s target countries. Norway would also work closelywith Bill Gates and Britain on the vaccination programme to ‘save nine millionchildren in poor countries’. By the way, Norway has many connections with theglobal bloodline conspiracy, but if they go ‘off-message’ over Israel, as theydid in the run-up to the ‘terrorist bomb’ and mass shootings in 2011, then theyare given their ‘punishment’.FORMER INSIDER EXPOSES THE SCAMWhile I was writing this chapter, I watched a tremendous interview on theexcellent Conscious Media Network (www.consciousmedianetwork.com[http://www.consciousmedianetwork.com] – highly recommended) with a really gutsylady – Dr Lorraine Day. She was an orthopaedic surgeon and head of department atSan Francisco General Hospital and she saw from the inside the killing machinethat is ‘modern medicine’ and the vaccine fraud. Dr Day said: ‘The medicalindustry in general was developed for control and financial gain. It has noother reason for its existence.’ She said that there was a ‘sinister plan’ toget everyone on drugs because all drugs were mind altering – ‘even if it is foryour stomach’. They alter your mind and your ability to understand truth, shesaid. ‘When you are on mind-altering drugs, it’s like being on street drugs.’She said that disease is caused by the way we eat and live and she gave theexample of seeing actor Michael J Fox talking about his Parkinson’s diseasewhile drinking a brain-zapping diet soda that was contributing to it. Drugs onlycovered up the symptoms, she said. ‘It never solves the problem; at best it canhide the problem.’ Dr Day said that the entire medical industry was based onmoney made from disease. Would that industry, therefore, want more disease, orless? There are fundraisers for this disease or that disease, charities for thisdisease or that disease, but nothing really changes. Dr Day said there were morepeople making their living from the cancer industry than people who have cancer.Sixty-five per cent of the income for the Rockefeller-created American CancerSociety goes to pay executive salaries and other costs and only five per centfunded patient care, she said. ‘The American Cancer Society was established by aRockefeller to control the information that people learn about cancer and toencourage them to go to their doctors.’ This is why you rarely see informationabout alternative ways to treat cancer and, even better, how to avoid it throughdiet, lifestyle and exercise. Dr Day said that mammograms that check for breastcancer are increasing the chances of getting breast cancer because of theradiation. She also revealed that abortions dramatically increase the chances ofbreast cancer and that the authorities know this. When a woman is pregnant, herbreast cells become unstable as they prepare to produce milk. An abortionterminates this process before completion and the breast cells then remainunstable indefinitely.Dr Day was one of the first to alert people to the dangers of AIDS, which, shesaid, was injected into the homosexual community in San Francisco and then intoAfrica through vaccination programmes. The Big Pharma-controlled Centers forDisease Control (CDC) told her at first that AIDS could not be passed betweenhumans when they knew that it could. They also bizarrely insisted that drugusers could contract AIDS from needles, but medical staff could not. It took amember of staff at Dr Day’s hospital to acquire AIDS from a needle for theexecutives at the CDC to accept that they were talking quite obvious nonsense.Dr Day said that the introduction of AIDS to Africa is about depopulation andstealing the resources of the continent. They also infected African monkeys andreleased them into the wild to spread the disease and give them a fake originfor AIDS when it was probably the creation of the United States biologicalweapons programme (in truth, if not official) at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Thisis also home to US Army Medical Command; US Army Medical Research and MaterielCommand; US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases; and theNational Cancer Institute. Good to keep it all in-house. Dr Day said thatmandatory vaccinations would cause ‘a deterioration and illness and destructionof the human race more rapidly than we’re destroying ourselves by the way we areeating and living [and] there will eventually be nothing left if we keep on thistack’. She said that before vaccines there was virtually no autism and virtuallyno Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The main cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndromewas vaccines – ‘that has been established beyond a shadow of a doubt’. Shedescribed an experiment in which babies were connected to sensors to measuretheir blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate. They were all fine andstable until they were given vaccines. Then the electrode readings were ‘allover the place’ for three weeks. Many babies stopped breathing or had slowbreathing. There were seizures, and temperature went ‘sky high’ to the extentthat they could cause damage to the brain. ‘They don’t work, they don’t work,’she said. ‘Look at the graphs of infectious diseases before and after vaccinesand you will see that there was no change.’ Polio had already dropped 85 percent because of improved sanitation and nutrition by the time a vaccine wasintroduced, she said, and the curve did not change once immunisation began. DrDay said that after polio vaccination began some 85 to 100 per cent of polio wascaused by the live vaccine, and to hide this fact from the public they changedthe name of polio to Aseptic Meningitis. A disease was ‘eradicated’ by changingits name. Dr Day said that mercury in vaccines causes autism which was unknownbefore vaccination began, and that vaccines are grown in human and animal cellsthat are contaminated with cancer and other diseases. Vaccines also contain ‘awhole bundle of toxins’. The authorities are now talking about ‘super vaccines’of six or seven in the same shot. This is insanity, and calculated, like theentire vaccine and Big Pharma medical industry, to kill you and your childrenand grandchildren. Dr Day told of a study in which a group of animals wasinjected with one substance and survived; a second group was injected withanother substance and survived; but when both substances were injected togetherinto a third group, every animal died. Dr Day has been banned from many radioand television shows for her exposure of Big Pharma from personal experience.Media and medical journals will not quote her or say anything that upsets thepharmaceutical cartel because of the threat to withdraw the advertising that isessential for their survival. You can see Dr Lorraine Day’s information on manyand various subjects at: www.drday.com [http://www.drday.com].YOU ARE WHAT YOU EATFood and drink additives are designed to imbalance the human mind, body andemotions to make our lives as short as possible, and to distort and suppress theway we decode reality (Figs 330 [../Text/index_split_196.html#filepos1458344]).The bloodlines want their slaves to live only as long as they can effectivelyserve their system; and then who cares about the elderly – deny them treatment,get rid of them. Our intake of chemicals and toxins is also increased by havingmost food packaged in plastic containers or wrapped in plastic. Toxins in theplastic are absorbed by the food; and I see produce marked ‘organic’ wrapped inplastic, which, by definition, means that it can’t be ‘organic’. There is alsothe point that HAARP transmissions have the potential to increase a thousandfoldthe strength of toxic substances in toxic human bodies. Food and drink additivestarget everyone, but especially children and young people generally. They arepreparing children to be their adult zombie slaves in their Brave New World (Fig331 [../Text/index_split_197.html#filepos1458896]). Studies and personalexperience have shown that chemical additives cause major changes in thebehaviour of children. Their brains are being chemically rewired (Fig 332[../Text/index_split_198.html#filepos1459467]). When these imbalanced behaviourtraits emerge, the kids are given mind-altering drugs like Ritalin to furtherdistort their thinking and emotional processes. Among the physical consequencesof Ritalin are heart palpitations and heart attacks. The drugging of children –and the rest of the population come to that – is absolutely fantastic (Fig 333[../Text/index_split_199.html#filepos1460046]). This has increased with enormousleaps in recent years along with every element of the bloodline conspiracy asthey sprint to their line. Here are some figures for Ritalin in the UK: In 1993,doctors issued 3,500 prescriptions for Ritalin; by 1996 it was 26,500; in 2006the UK National Health Service (not including private medicine) handed out250,000; and by 2007 the figure was 461,000. There are also similar drugs suchas Adderall, Concerta, Metadate CD, Ritalin LA, Focalin XR, Strattera(Atomoxetine) and Risperdal. The latter is a drug used to extract informationfrom political prisoners in the Soviet Union. Take a deep breath and read thatagain. They are giving children a truth-extractor drug and it is even beingadvertised on play bricks for children at paediatricians’ offices acrossAmerica. David Healy, a leading psychopharmacology expert and Professor ofPsychiatry at Cardiff University in Wales, said: ‘People who took [Risperdal]would tell anything to anyone … when you think about giving these drugs to kids,it’s a whole new ball game.’ Maryanne Godboldo, a mother in Detroit, wastargeted by an armed SWAT team when she refused to give her daughtermind-altering Risperdal for alleged ‘Attention Deficit Disorder’. This wasconsidered by the now fascist Child ‘Protective’ Services to be parental neglectand so cue the armed goons in uniform to force their way into the home ofMaryanne Godboldo to kidnap her child. A jury, which must surely have been onRisperdal themselves, later found her guilty at a time when federal and multiplestate prosecutors were suing producers Johnson & Johnson for deceptive marketingof the drug – including its use by children – and hiding dangerous effects. Howdo these people remember to breathe? Unbelievable. Big Pharma makes nearly $5billion a year drugging children for invented psychiatric conditions likeAttention Deficit Disorder and others that have been ‘diagnosed’ so far in 20million American children. There is a bloodline war on our children and youngpeople, as well as humanity in general, and it was all described in detail byFabian Society initiate, Aldous Huxley, in his book, Brave New World. This isthe reason for the dumbing down of education all over the world, and why all thecameras and biometric identity technology are in the schools (Fig 334[../Text/index_split_200.html#filepos1464875]).

We consume antibiotics in meat from animals given thesedrugs as a matter of course; we consume growth hormones given to animals to makethem fatter quicker to increase profits (one reason why there is so much extremeobesity); and we consume chemical poisons sprayed on crops in the field. Thinkabout that: People wearing chemical protection suits spray lethal poisons on ourfood and then we eat the stuff; but most people still have no problem with thatand believe there won’t be consequences for health. Plant disease has soaredsince some of the latest herbicides have been introduced and this is especiallytrue in the case of Monsanto’s market leader, Roundup. Their ingredients removenutrients from the soil, weaken a plant’s natural defences, kill beneficialorganisms and damage root systems, among a list of other consequences.Herbicides are creating ‘superweeds’ that have developed a resistance and leadto more and stronger herbicides being used. The combination of crop poisons andgenetic modification is one of the prime reasons for the collapse in the vitalbee populations that pollinate plants and flowers. We need to understandsomething big-time and fast. These people, and those that control them, aresystematically killing the population and destroying our ability to grow healthyfood, or even, in many cases, any food at all. They are planning global famines– yes, in western countries, too. Then we have genetically-modified food whichis part of a satanic assault on the human mind and body. Bloodline-fundedscientists are genetically modifying nature to produce mice that tweet likebirds, cats that glow in the dark and human genetics mixed with cows, goats,pigs and mice. Crazy South Korean scientists at Seoul National University havegenetically engineered a dog that glows ‘fluorescent green’ in ultraviolet lightwhen given an antibiotic known as doxycycline. Yes, I know. Go figure. Human DNAand plant DNA are being spliced as the whole fabric of nature is rewired. TheDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the driving force behindHAARP, wants to genetically change human DNA to create a breed ofmind-controlled soldiers that never disobey orders. Reptilians are obsessed withgenetics and technology, which they see as the same thing, and humanity is beingenslaved genetically and technologically. The Reptilian Alliance dictates to itsbloodline hybrids and they tell their lackeys in government to make it lawagainst all logic and good sense – unless you know what the real intention is.The British government secretly subsidised research to develop agenetically-modified potato resistant to the fungal disease known as ‘blight’when there was already a natural potato resistant to blight. Britain doesn’teven commercially grow GM crops because of public opposition, but the governmentsecretly uses public funds to develop GM. This would seem crazy until yourealise that introducing GM to Britain and destroying natural varieties is thehidden agenda. The US watchdog group, Public Employees for EnvironmentalResponsibility (PEER), revealed, with others, that the Obama administration issupporting genetically-engineered agriculture in more than 50 national wildliferefuges – a fact confirmed by internal emails. This was a ‘priority’ for theWhite House, the emails confirmed. PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch said: ‘TheWhite House is engaging in a joint effort with Monsanto.’ The White Houseworking in collusion with Monsanto? I don’t believe it. Must be a conspiracytheory. Those in the shadows know about the dangers to human health of GM food,but the ignorant gofers in government and administration introduce it becausethat is what they are told to do. This is how genetically-modified food isallowed against all independent scientific evidence (Fig 335[../Text/index_split_201.html#filepos1465440]). A study reported in India Todayfound that the Bt toxin widely used in GM crops has turned up in human bloodsamples. The report said:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00412.jpg] Figure 334: The ‘education’ (programming) system turning out the robots oftomorrow.

Making somethingsafe for humans is not the motivation (Fig 336[../Text/index_split_202.html#filepos1468651]). Jeffrey Smith, executivedirector of the Institute for Responsible Technology, said that mice fed naturalBt toxin showed significant immune responses and they became sensitive to otherformerly harmless compounds. Here is the theme again – targeting the immunesystem. Smith said that about 500 people reported reactions, mostly allergy orflu-like symptoms, when natural Bt was sprayed in Vancouver and Washington Stateto kill gypsy moths. Six people required emergency treatment. They don’t do thisto kill moths and it’s the same with all the other mass spraying of populationsunder various excuses. It is the people they’re after. Bt toxin has also startedturning up in waterways. They are systematically poisoning our world. Thebloodlines can do this and not be exposed and prosecuted because they own andcontrol the Big Food, Big Biotech and Big Pharma corporations; they control thegovernment food, drug and environment agencies which are supposed to protect thepublic from the ‘Bigs’; and they own and control the mainstream media and thereporting, or non-reporting, of these abominations. They are also cruciallyaided and abetted by the global army of ‘repeaters’. These are politicians,scientists, teachers and academics, ‘journalists’, doctors and the generalpopulation who just repeat what they are told without question. ‘Journalists’repeat what politicians say. Politicians repeat what their advisors and ‘thinktanks’ say. Scientists repeat what the official song-sheet says. Doctors repeatwhat Big Pharma and the Big Pharma-funded medical schools say. Teachers andacademics repeat what the curriculum, text books and official versions ofeverything say. Great swathes of the public then repeat what all of those peoplesay. The blind leading the blind is a phrase that could have been invented todescribe human society. All these people need to stop repeating and startquestioning and thinking for themselves."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00414.jpg] Figure 336: Genetically-modifying the population Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) MULTIPLE ATTACKSSmall farms and organic alternatives to this toxic diet are being targeted,along with alternatives to the Big Pharma medical system when the third biggestcause of death in America is medical treatment. Small farms are in the bloodlinegun-sight along with backyard food growers (Figs 337[../Text/index_split_203.html#filepos1472062] and 338[../Text/index_split_204.html#filepos1472650]). The idea is that eventually onlybloodline corporations will produce food. Did you know that the US Department ofAgriculture claims to own the name ‘organic’? Put the words: ‘Political ControlFreaks Take Over Farmers Market’ into YouTube to see how far this has alreadygone. Monsanto and other members of Big Biotech are destroying seed variety andpatenting the rest for their exclusive use. They are even patenting naturalvarieties of seeds that they have had nothing to do with developing. I tell thisstory at length in The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy. Big Biotechhas introduced what are called ‘terminator seeds’ that do not flower or growfruit after the initial planting, therefore requiring customers to repurchaseseed for every subsequent planting. This has devastated small and poor farmersaround the world who were using seeds from one year’s crop to sow the followingyear. The plan is to make everyone dependent on the Biotech giants for theirseeds and then massively increase the price to put the competition for foodproduction out of business. In 2009, Bloomberg reported that Monsanto, theworld’s biggest seed-maker, was increasing the price of new genetically-modifiedseeds by a colossal 42 per cent. We will also seeProblem–and–No-Problem–Reaction–Solution food scares involving foods that aregood for us, especially those produced organically. The e-coli outbreak inGermany in 2011 was an example of this and involved a new ‘super strain’ ofdrug-resistant e-coli called 0104:H4. Yes, I bet it did. The ‘mystery strain’ isresistant to an unprecedented eight major classes of antibiotics and had to beengineered in a laboratory. Humans are becoming more immune to antibiotics ingeneral because they are so over prescribed that the bugs mutate to counterthem; and eaters of meat are consuming antibiotics regularly. The ecoli outbreakwas exploited to call for all food to be irradiated, and organic and smallfarmers in Spain were severely affected when they were wrongly blamed as thesource. US government communications made public by WikiLeaks revealed thatSpain was resisting American pressure to accept genetically-modified food andcrops, and that the US pledged retaliation for doing so."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00415.jpg] Figure 337: Small and independent farmers and growers are on the hit list of BigPharma-and Big Biotech-controlled governments and law enforcement Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00416.jpg] Figure 338: Ever more laws and regulations are planned to make life impossiblefor farmers and growers that are not part of the giant food corporations Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) The scale of the deceit can be seen in the way that the Sun has been demonisedin recent decades. Oh, you mustn’t go out in the sun or you might get skincancer; and if you do go out in the sun you must use sunscreen. A couple ofthings here: Firstly, we need the vitamin D that we get from sunlight to be atall healthy; and secondly, it is the toxic sunscreen creams that cause skincancer – not the Sun. They have also demonised cholesterol as a cause of heartattacks when we need cholesterol to transform ultraviolet light from the Suninto vitamin D. Some sanity was restored in 2010 when the British Association ofDermatologists, Multiple Sclerosis Society, Cancer Research UK, Primary CareDermatology Society, National Osteoporosis Society, Diabetes UK and NationalHeart Forum agreed that exposure to sunlight is necessary for the absorption ofVitamin D. A deficiency can damage kidneys and bones, cause diabetes, cancer andmental disorders such as schizophrenia. The sunlight–cholesterol double whammyis part of the depopulation agenda and produces colossal profits for Big Pharmafrom all the ill health that it generates. They tell people that cholesterolcauses heart disease, because they know that suppressed cholesterol will meanless vitamin D is absorbed and a long list of health consequences, especiallywhen combined with using cancer-causing sunscreens to block out the sunlight.You have to take everything the authorities tell us and flip it around. Theopposite of what they say is nearly always the truth. Big Pharma came up with‘statins’, a drug to reduce cholesterol (and therefore vitamin D absorption), toprotect people from heart disease – when statins increase the chance of heartdisease! Researchers at the Tufts University School of Medicine in the UnitedStates also found that ‘cholesterol-lowering drugs significantly increased therisk of cancer’. A study involving 350,000 men at high risk of heart diseasereduced their cholesterol consumption by 42 per cent, saturated fat consumptionby 28 per cent and total calories by 21 per cent … and it made no differencewhatsoever. No clinical trial has ever shown that reducing saturated fat intakehas produced a reduction in heart disease. Dr Ancel Keys, professor emeritus atthe University of Minnesota, rightly said: > There’s no connection whatsoever between cholesterol in food and cholesterol> in blood. And we’ve known that all along. Cholesterol in the diet doesn’t> matter at all unless you happen to be a chicken or a rabbit. Dr George Mann, a biochemist and physician at Vanderbilt University inNashville, wrote an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine calling thecholesterol hoax the ‘greatest scam in the history of medicine’. There have beenso many. Dr Mann talked of the ‘Heart Mafia’ and he said that ‘it will seem tomany that there was an unwholesome conspiracy’. There was, and is. The food anddrug industry earns more than $50 billion a year from the low-cholesterol lie.The bloodline-controlled US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is still sayingthat ‘broad spectrum’ sunscreen is the only way to stop skin cancer when thesunscreen is the cause of skin cancer, while doing nothing about full-bodyradiation scanners that blast the skin with radiation. The FDA is owned by BigPharma and Big Biotech. Dr Michael Holick, Professor of Medicine, Physiology andBiophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, said: > The population of the world has been brainwashed by the American Academy of> Dermatology and the sunscreen industry for thirty years, with the unrelenting> message that you should never be exposed to direct sunlight because it is> going to cause serious skin cancer and death. People are really quite> surprised by the new message that sensible skin exposure in moderation is very> important for good health. We should appreciate the sun for its benefits, and> not abuse it. They are surprised because they have been told a deliberate lie for decades. Allthe legislation and red tape that is drowning small businesses all over theworld is also part of the plan. They want an end to all business that isn’t donethrough the world government structure and its corporations and banks. Thepublic, too, is being deluged with laws and regulations, and the scale oflegislation over the last 20 years has been incredible. A new law was passedevery three hours during the ten years that ‘shapeshifter’ Tony Blair was inDowning Street and 98 per cent of them were not even debated in Parliament. Theywere imposed through something called ‘statutory instruments’ that allow thegovernment to dictate what is going to happen. The same can be seen in theUnited States through Presidential Orders that bypass Congress, and throughgovernment agencies that can make their own rules. The constant spraying of newlaws and regulations across society from all levels of government is part of apsychological operation aimed at mass behaviour-modification (Fig 339[../Text/index_split_205.html#filepos1479873]). This works in the same way asbehaviour experiments with rats and mice. Scientists set up a maze of channelsfor a mouse to walk down, but some routes produce an electric shock and themouse will change direction. When the mouse has been shocked a few times you cantake the shock equipment away and it still won’t go down that channel again. Themouse’s behaviour has been modified. The explosion of laws dictating virtuallyevery detail of our lives is meant to do the same to humans. The technique is toensure that people constantly face ‘shocks’ or potential ‘shocks’ from all the‘dos and don’ts’, ‘musts and can’ts’; and to bombard us with so many punishments– big and small – for not complying, that our behaviour is modified and webecome acquiescent, unquestioning slaves. Well, I know someone who won’t be."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00417.jpg] Figure 339: The explosion in Big Brother legislation is the bloodline spidertying humanity to its web Illustration by David Dees (deesillustration.com [http://deesillustration.com]) THERE IS NO CONSPIRACY?I included in my last book, the mega work, Human Race Get Off Your Knees, thestory of a man called Dr Richard Day, and it is appropriate to repeat what hesaid in 1969 about the way the world was going to change in accordance with ahidden plan. For those new to this information, or those who have not read‘Human Race’, it might be a sobering moment after reading about the conspiracythat I have laid out in this book and which people can see with their own eyestoday as the Orwellian world rolls out. Richard Day (Rothschild Zionist) was thenational medical director of the Illuminati–front, Planned Parenthood,established by the eugenics-funding Rockefeller family, and he was Professor ofPediatrics at ‘Moon-god Mountain’ – the Mount Sinai Medical School in New York.Dr Jacob Appel (Rothschild Zionist), who wants to put mind-altering lithium intodrinking water, also works there. Day made a speech to about 80 doctors at thePittsburgh Pediatric Society on March 20th, 1969. He asked everyone to turn offany recording equipment and stop taking notes, because he wanted to reveal acoming new world system and the plan to sabotage American industry. One doctorin the audience, Lawrence Dunegan, a Pittsburgh paediatrician, did take notes,and before he died in 2004 he made a series of taped interviews about what hehad heard nearly 50 years earlier. Dr Richard Day, a Rockefeller insider, saidthat different parts of the world would be assigned different roles of industryand commerce in a unified global system (the same was planned from the startwith the European Union, as I have exposed in other books). The pre-eminence ofthe United States and the relative independence and self-sufficiency of Americawas going to end, Day said. The old structure would have to be destroyed to makeway for the new. What did I say? They are using America to destroy America.Every part of the world would have a specialty and so become inter-dependent,Day said. America would remain a centre for agriculture, high tech,communications and education, but heavy industry would be ‘transported out’.This is exactly what has happened with the run-down of the Americanmanufacturing industry and the mass outsourcing of jobs to other countries. Morethan 42,000 American factories closed between 2001 and 2010 with 5.5 millionmanufacturing jobs lost. China now makes more cars than the US and Japantogether. This has also been happening within the European Union as we havewitnessed the end of previously diverse economies and their domination bycertain specialisations. This makes everyone dependent on everyone else and onlythe bloodlines would have control of the system as a whole.Dr Dunegan said that Richard Day revealed the plan to cull and control thepopulation through medicine, food, new laboratory-made diseases and thesuppression of the cure for cancer. ‘We can cure almost every cancer right now,’he said in 1969. ‘Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute [now theRockefeller University] if it’s ever decided that it should be released.’ TheEl-ite has access to it though, naturally, and this is another reason why somany of them live for so long. The CIA scientist who told me about the microchipprogramme said that he had been cured of cancer by a serum made available to himonly because they wanted to keep him alive to continue his work for them. Daysaid that letting people die of cancer would slow down population growth. And,charmingly: ‘You may as well die of cancer as something else.’ Like I say, thesepeople have no empathy and no emotion. Day believed in eugenics and ‘survival ofthe fittest’, so long as it didn’t apply to him. He said in 1969 that abortionwould no longer be illegal and it would be accepted as normal (and provide aconstant supply of foetuses for the satanic rituals). The food supply would bemonitored so that no-one could give food to a ‘fugitive of the system’. He wastalking about people challenging the system when it reached its most extremestages. Growing food privately would be banned by saying it wasn’t safe. Youngpeople would spend longer in school, but not learn anything (the dumbing downthat we have seen); and family would be manipulated to ‘diminish in importance’(hence the endless attacks on family life and the State stealing children).There would be restrictions on travel, and private home–ownership woulddisappear (this is included in Agenda 21). He said that they would increaseviolence, pornography and obscenity in the media and movies to desensitisepeople to violence and porn and make them feel that life is short, precariousand brutish. Music would ‘get worse’ and be used for programming perception(see: Lady Gaga and so many others). Society would be severely controlled andpeople would be electronically tagged. Long-established communities would bedestroyed by unemployment and mass immigration (one of the goals of theRothschild Zionist Frankfurt School behind political correctness). Weathermodification would be used as a weapon of war and to create drought or famine(HAARP). This was one of Day’s specialist fields. He was involved in weathermodification during World War II. ‘People will have to get used to the idea ofchange, so used to change that they’ll be expecting change [see: Barack Obama].Nothing will be permanent.’ This is a summary of what Day predicted in 1969posted at: www.overlordsofchaos.com [http://www.overlordsofchaos.com]: > Population control; permission to have babies; redirecting the purpose of sex> – sex without reproduction and reproduction without sex; contraception> universally available to all; sex education and carnalising of youth as a tool> of world government; tax-funded abortion as population control; encouraging> anything-goes homosexuality; technology used for reproduction without sex;> families to diminish in importance; euthanasia and the ‘demise pill’; limiting> access to affordable medical care makes eliminating elderly easier; medicine> would be tightly controlled; elimination of private doctors; new> difficult-to-diagnose and untreatable diseases; suppressing cancer cures as a> means of population control; inducing heart attacks as a form of> assassination; education as a tool for accelerating the onset of puberty and> evolution; blending all religions … the old religions will have to go;> changing the Bible through revisions of key words; restructuring education as> a tool of indoctrination; more time in schools, but pupils ‘wouldn’t learn> anything’; controlling who has access to information; schools as the hub of> the community; some books would just disappear from the libraries; changing> laws to promote moral and social chaos; the encouragement of drug abuse to> create a jungle atmosphere in cities and towns; promote alcohol abuse;> restrictions on travel; the need for more jails, and using hospitals as jails;> no more psychological or physical security; crime used to manage society;> curtailment of US industrial pre-eminence; shifting populations and economies> – tearing out the social roots; sports as a tool of social engineering and> change; sex and violence inculcated through entertainment; implanted ID cards> – microchips; food control; weather control; knowing how people respond –> making them do what you want; falsified scientific research; use of terrorism;> surveillance, implants, and televisions that watch you; the arrival of the> totalitarian global system. Day also said that people who don’t want to go along with the new world systemwould be ‘disposed of humanely’. There would be no ‘martyrs’, he said. ‘Peoplewill just disappear.’ So that is what is ‘going on’. Nice isn’t it? So are wegoing to just sit around and wait for our fate? Or, is not time to say, ‘ENOUGH– NO MORE!’?I think so."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/00418.jpg] The question that I am asked most is ‘what can we do?’ This is understandableonce people realise that we are facing the onslaught of evil which I have beendescribing in these pages. I will provide answers to that question in thisclosing chapter, but a key part of the ‘solution’, or removing the cause of theproblem, is to know what is happening and what we are dealing with. We can onlyfind relevant ‘answers’ when we understand the true nature of the problem.‘Love’ is the one-syllable answer to ‘what can we do?’ I am sure the reaction tothis by many people will be: ‘Love? What good will love do against HAARP?’ Well,actually, plenty, as I will explain shortly. We have a support system now whichI call the Truth Vibrations and there is a terrific challenge to Reptilian/Greycontrol happening involving benevolent extraterrestrial/interdimensional forcesto remove them from Saturn and the Moon and eliminate the Matrix ‘hack’. I wastold in 1990 that a great awakening was coming in my lifetime that would openhuman minds to all that had been suppressed and forgotten. Neil Hague and myselfsymbolise the Truth Vibrations as a lion (Fig 340[../Text/index_split_207.html#filepos1493653]). I was given the informationthrough Betty Shine and others in the earliest days of my own awakening thathumanity had been in a trance, a state of amnesia, and new vibrations – a newwaveform information source – were going to symbolically snap their fingers andallow sleeping beauty to awaken. The more open minds would be the first to betouched by this transformation, but eventually vast numbers would be freed fromtheir mental and emotional prison cells. I was told that the Truth Vibrationswould also bring to the surface all that has been hidden, and the veil would belifted on the secrets that have been kept from us. This was more than 20 yearsago and this is precisely what is happening. Multi-millions are awakening to anew perception of self and the world, and the veil is most certainly beinglifted on the conspiracy to enslave us all. This is a moment of great challenge,but also limitless opportunity for those prepared to grasp it. We need toappreciate how we are interacting with the energy field of Planet Earth everymoment that we are attached to this reality. Without that interaction, wecouldn’t be here. The point to emphasise is that the term is inter-action, atwo-way process. We give and we receive. What we call ‘physical’ reality isdecoded waveform information communicated from the centre of the galaxy wheremainstream scientists say there is, to use their term, a ‘supermassive blackhole’ (Fig 341 [../Text/index_split_208.html#filepos1494194]). There is a starright in the centre of it according to some reports, and certainly moresophisticated infra-red cameras have discovered what are described as ‘massive’stars and star clusters in the galactic centre (Fig 342[../Text/index_split_209.html#filepos1494483]). Mainstream science suggests thatthere are supermassive black holes at the centre of every galaxy, but theirdescription of what ‘black holes’ are differs fundamentally from my own. Thegalactic centre is mission control for the galaxy. This is where the poweremanates from and the information for the Milky Way expression of the cosmicvirtual-reality game. The galaxy is a mass of encoded waveform informationfields that we decode into the ‘physical’ (holographic) galaxy that we see.Well, that is how it is supposed to be without ‘The Hack’. Stars like our Sun(and the brown dwarf/sun known as the ‘planet’ Saturn) receive this informationin multiple dimensions of reality and communicate this in their region of thegalaxy. Stars are like vast receiver–transmitters and transformers on a galacticwaveform/electrical communication grid. Earth, humanity and all life, be theyanimals, plants or trees, are receiving, transmitting and generally interactingwith these galactic/solar/planetary information sources."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00419.jpg] Figure 340: The Truth Vibrations are breathing a new awareness into theinformation fabric of our reality Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00420.jpg] Figure 341: The galactic centre "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00421.jpg] Figure 342: The galactic centre in infra-red What I call the Time Loop appears to pass through distinct cycles that providevery different collective ‘movies’ for Consciousness to experience, and theancients described this with their concepts of the circular/cyclical nature of‘time’. Ancient India referred to these segments of experience as ‘yugas’(cycles). The Ancient Greeks talked of the ‘Great Year’ of 24,000 years throughwhich we pass from a Golden Age to Silver, Bronze and Iron ages before returningthrough Bronze and Silver to Golden. Don’t confuse this with the Iron Age andBronze Age taught in the schools about the periods when iron and bronze werediscovered. This is not the same thing at all. Ancient Greeks and many otherssaid that it takes 12,000 years to travel through the cycle from the Golden Ageof fantastic expansion of Consciousness and Awareness to the Iron Age when theopposite is the case and people are only aware of the five senses and littlemore. This is also known as the Dark Age. The Greek ages of the Great Yearcorrespond with the Vedic and Hindu yugas – the Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwaparayuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age). At least30 ancient societies told the same story. There appear to be several opinionsabout how long it takes to complete a yuga and which one we are currentlyexperiencing. Some of it is a bit of a ‘dog’s breakfast’ (a mess or a muddle) itseems to me. Many connect these alleged cycles to the ‘Precession of theEquinoxes’. The ancients divided the heavens into astrological sections thattogether complete a circle, and this is represented in the famous Dendera Zodiacat the Hathor temple at Dendera, near Luxor in Egypt and in many other artefactsleft by long-lost civilisations (Fig 343). Mainstream science says that theEarth’s ‘wobble’ causes the planet to move slowly though a cycle of facingdifferent signs, or ages, of the zodiac in the heavens and this is thePrecession of the Equinoxes which is estimated to take approximately 25,765years to complete a full cycle (Fig 344[../Text/index_split_210.html#filepos1500140]). We are now in the process ofmoving from the Age of Pisces into the Age of Aquarius, according to thatsystem. The Ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, wrote that he had been told of theGreat Year cycle by Egyptian priests who spoke of the four different ages in theGreat Year. Plato said that the priests had told him that the Ancient Greekswere like children, because they had forgotten the knowledge from higher ages.Ancient Indian accounts tell of four illusions that cover the infinity of God.Illusions that cover infinity is a very good way of describing the Time Loopreality in general that we currently experience as the ‘physical’ world. We arenow moving through a Bronze Age towards a Silver Age on an upward spiral to theGolden Age if you believe the ‘ages’ system. There are many myths and legendsabout highly advanced civilisations known as Atlantis and Mu, or Lemuria, whichended in great Earth upheavals. Plato wrote about Atlantis and said that thisexisted during the Golden Age. I have already said that Charles Darwin’s versionof human experience with a constant forward direction of increasing knowledgeand intelligence through ‘survival of the fittest’ and ‘natural selection’ isnonsense, and this is why the concept dominates mainstream science and‘education’. When the consciousness of a planet’s inhabitants is suppressed andat other times not suppressed there will be a subsequent difference in theirpotential to understand and manifest. This has happened many times on PlanetEarth and so there have been periods of expanded awareness and others ofsuppressed awareness. Extraordinary ancient structures that we would struggle tobuild today were created by high initiates using expanded awareness and theknow-how and support of the Reptilian Alliance. It has been pointed out that theGreat Pyramid at Giza in Egypt consists of two-and-a-half million stones, eachweighing many tonnes which were put together over something like 20 years. Thiswould require between one and two blocks being placed into positionapproximately every two minutes in that period; and there is a granite block inthe King’s Chamber that alone weighs 70 tonnes. Scientists and archaeologistsproduce theories on how the pyramids were built from the perspective of currentknowledge and the idea that, because of the Darwin theory, the ancients musthave been more primitive than we are. We therefore have the laughable officialstory that the pyramids were built by constructing ramps alongside them so thatslaves could pull the stones up the incline to where they were needed. This ishow stones weighing many tonnes were placed in position every two minutes? Yeah,sounds feasible.image [../Images/00422.jpg] Figure 343: The Dendera Zodiac "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00423.jpg] Figure 344: Scientists say that the Earth’s ‘wobble’ is the cause of the‘Precession of the Equinoxes’ THE GREAT YEAR AND 2012Boris Fritz, an American aerospace engineer, has studied the yuga cycles and thehistory of India and its ancient Sanskrit language for 40 years. He said in aninterview with Regina Meredith on the Conscious Media Network that the most thatcan be attained in the Iron Age or Dark Age is to explore and be aware of therealm of the five senses. Fritz indicates from Vedic and other sources that thelast descending period of a Dark Age was between 700 BC to the zenith at AD 500.He says the ascending Dark Age took us from AD 500 to about AD 1600 when humansbegan to enter a Bronze Age period. What followed was the intellectualtransformation known as the Renaissance and the emergence of literature,science, art, religion and politics, and a focus on classical sources ofinformation. Copernicus published his work on the Earth orbiting the Sun shortlybefore his death in 1543, and then came Galileo (1564–1642), the Italianphysicist, mathematician, astronomer and philosopher who has been described asthe ‘Father of Modern Science’. Boris Fritz says that we were fully into theBronze Age by 1900 and that this has been expressed in all the technologicaldiscoveries and developments of the 20th and now 21st centuries. The theory saysthat the early period of a Bronze Age sees the expansion of the intellect, butas the age progresses we begin to break out of mind and into our higher levelsof awareness. It is said that we will climb the spiral to the Silver Age about2,000 years from now when we conquer the illusion of time and communicatethrough telepathy as a matter of course. The theory says that this is the age of‘wizardry’ and that what today we would call miracles would be achieved throughmanipulating the illusion by knowing it is an illusion and how it functions.Finally, comes the Golden Age of fantastic expansions of consciousness that meantechnology is no longer needed to do anything, this theory says. Advocatesbelieve that creation in the Golden Age period comes from direct manifestationthrough consciousness. The Mayan people, in what is now the Yucatan in Mexicofrom about AD 250 to 900, also believed in the circular nature of time and howthe cycle was divided into periods of differing levels of awareness. Theymeasured cycles within larger cycles. The 24,000/25,000-year cycle was only oneof them. They said there are other cycles that are much longer and others thatare much shorter. The Mayans had a ‘Grand Cycle’ of 25,630 years, which isroughly one complete cycle of the Precession of the Equinoxes, and they dividedthe Grand Cycle into five ‘Great Cycles’ or ‘World Ages’ of 5,125 years. Thepresent Mayan Great Cycle is said to have begun in 3114 BC and will endaccording to some researchers on December 21st, 2012. Others say it is 2011, ora different date in 2012 such as December 12th. We are in a period of change,that’s for sure, but there is a ‘Big But’ coming with regard to 2012 and thecycles. We are experiencing a period of fundamental change because of thegathering impact of the Truth Vibrations that I was told about in 1990, and anenormous amount of manipulation that is becoming ever more extreme (Fig 345).The Truth Vibrations are a vast expansion of the information and awarenessavailable to us, and those who connect with their frequency band have thepotential to experience an incredibly expanded awareness. Those who keep theirminds under lock and key will not be affected at all in a positive way. It’s achoice, as always (Fig 346 [../Text/index_split_211.html#filepos1506739]). TheTruth Vibrations are seeking out the ‘dark’ places of density, manipulation andfear, and deleting the power these have over human perception (Fig 347[../Text/index_split_212.html#filepos1507379]). I am seeing ever more clearlythose who are connecting with the Truth Vibrations and those who are desperatelyclinging to the old ways of thinking and perceiving. Some are opening theirminds to a whole new perception of self, life and the world while others arebecoming more stressed, anxious and fearful as their energetic environmentchanges by the hour, but they don’t change with it. We are interacting with the‘sea’ of energy, and when that changes and we don’t, there are obviously goingto be consequences mentally, emotionally and ‘physically’ the more ‘out of syc’that people become. There is such a mass of different vibrational statesswirling around in the energy ‘sea’, including many generated by HAARP and otherradiation technologies that are there to entrap people in low-vibrational statesthat will make the Truth Vibrations pass them by. We have to open our minds toConsciousness to avoid that vibrational entrapment. I don’t see 2012 as aspecial year in the way that is claimed, and I’ll explain why when I get to the‘Big But’. The perception-changing Truth Vibrations have been having a gatheringimpact as their power increases and more people beat to their drum. This powerwill go on increasing through 2012 and onwards for many years yet. 2012 will befurther forward than 2011 but not as advanced as 2013, and so on. We are on thecusp of incredible change, one way or the other, and we need to open our mindsand hearts to get the full benefit of the positive aspects of what is happening.image [../Images/00424.jpg] Figure 345: The Truth Vibrations are changing the information that we receivefrom the Sun Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00425.jpg] Figure 346: Those who open their hearts and minds to the Truth Vibrations aregoing to experience a transformation of their perception of self and the‘world’.

I had no idea what a ‘channel’ was, and I am sure many people new tothis information would be asking the same. Channel? What channel? – the EnglishChannel, television channel, what’s he talking about? A channel is somebody whoallows themself to be used as a receiver, or vehicle, for another consciousnessfrom another dimension or frequency range of reality to speak through them. Theprocess is similar to that of a psychic, but while a psychic reports the wordsthat they decode, a channel speaks the words directly. There are brilliantchannels and there are channels who are connecting with nothing and speakingfrom their own minds, just as there are brilliant psychics andkidding-you-and-themselves ‘psychics’. There are also malevolent entities, notleast the Reptilians, that speak through channels to mislead; and there arechannels who are assets of mind-control programmes who have their ‘channelled’information implanted for them to repeat from apparently ‘out there’. In otherwords, you have to be very careful, discerning and streetwise when dealing withsuch channelled messages. But the information given to me through the channel,or ‘sensitive’, that I met in the West of England in 1990, has stood the test ofevents ever since. I was taken aback when the lady went into channel-mode. Herface changed (anyone who doesn’t believe in shapeshifting should have beenthere) and her voice altered. The awareness communicating through her as shedecoded a projected electromagnetic field gave the name ‘Magnu’. I have usedthis information in two or three books over the years and every time I do themessage becomes ever more relevant and significant to unfolding events. This iswhat ‘Magnu’ said in 1990: > I feel you are sensing now the energies coming in, the energies surrounding> your planet. This is causing many of you to ask questions. It is causing many> of you to re-evaluate completely your way of life, where you feel you wish to> go, what you want to do. It is causing tremendous upheavals. Some of these> upheavals are very confusing, very distressing, very disturbing. Some people> in partnerships are finding they can no longer continue in those partnerships> because their partners cannot tune into what they are tuning into. It is> causing a great deal of disturbance. And I have said to this sensitive on more> than one occasion that you must organise yourselves into groups to support> each other. > Now then. My own allegiance with your planet goes back to an Atlantean period> … [when] … there were many energies being used and information and knowledge> being used which were for particular reasons of safety withdrawn, shall we> say, to prevent complete catastrophe, to prevent total destruction of your> planet. One could say these were sort of emergency measures if you like, to> prevent the inhabitants of this planet from an untimely destruction. > Now at that time, shall we say, this knowledge was distributed only to the> few; it was taught in what one could call a temple setting, though I am very> careful about using this word. It has connotations, maybe. So, let me use that> word in the broadest possible sense. There were those initiated into this> knowledge. There were grades of initiation and those who passed the full> initiation, these were known as the Guardians of the Light and Keepers of the> Secret Knowledge. This is the context from which I am coming. > There came a time when this knowledge and the energies were withdrawn. It is> very difficult for me to explain to you precisely what I mean by that, so I> will let you mull these things over. As the energies around your planet> quicken, so these latent energies, these energies which have been withdrawn,> will now be phased back in. They will gradually be awakened. As the> consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those of you Light Workers> who are working together to raise your consciousness, you will be able to hold> more and more refined vibrations, and so we will be able to use you as a> catalyst to be able to feed in more and more energies. > As more of you raise yourselves to meet the challenge, so we can awaken more> of these energies. Now, energy is consciousness and the energies themselves> contain the knowledge and the information which is beginning to surface again> in your consciousness, so that many of you will remember the Atlantean times.> You will remember that you communicated with say, dolphins and whales. You> understood these other sentient creatures. You could levitate. You could> manifest things. You could cause spontaneous combustion by not miraculous> means at all. Once you know what you are doing, these things follow. It is a> matter of order. > Now I am looking at a time on your planet when these energies, this knowledge> is re-awakened and re-integrated into your consciousness. I am not looking to> a time when this knowledge will be for a few, but when your whole planet will> be awakened to this understanding which you have simply forgotten.

It is not a matter of small changes, of a little thing here, a little> thing there. You are really being asked to turn yourselves inside out. There> is a massive shadow which must be cleared and it is up to Light Workers such> as yourself to focus on that challenge. THE BIG BUTWhat is being described here is the ‘Fall of Man’ which, in part, was caused bythose energies – information – being withdrawn to prevent the Reptilian Alliancefrom using them for even greater destruction and control. These Truth Vibrationenergies are now being phased back in to awaken humanity and to allow those insync with them to remember what they once knew. This is nothing to do with 2012or any yuga, age, cycle or any of it. The theory of yugas, ages and cyclespassed down from ancient societies makes sense, I’ll grant you. I have alwayshad a problem with the 2012 belief system, but I went along with most of the‘cycles within cycles’ theme for a while on the basis of this is how it looks atthe moment; but I am ready to change in the light of new information. I canunderstand why so many people believe that this is how the world works and howit explains what is happening today at the end of what is claimed to be a MayanGreat Cycle. But it doesn’t. This ‘information’ was encoded long ago to divertand confuse us at this very time. I said earlier that the Reptilian ‘hijackprogram’ has been running for aeons. It is the same principle as DavidRockefeller knowing the fate of the Twin Towers when he was arranging for themto be built. The same thing happens over thousands of years as information trapsare primed in one era to go off in another. In fact, you don’t even need to dothat in the realms of no-time. You just project a hologram onto our holographicreality and ‘hey, we’ve just discovered information about the Mayan propheciesand their version of time’. Whichever way it was, it is a trap. These yugas,ages and cycles are phenomena within the Time Loop, and the Time Loop is thehack (Fig 348 [../Text/index_split_213.html#filepos1517933]). There areenergetic cycles in the unhacked virtual reality, but they are not these cycles.The concept of 2012 and ‘moving into a new age’ is all part of the Saturn–MoonMatrix illusion. A sense of time is a most profound controlling force that holdsus fast in the illusion. It makes us age when we are ageless; it makes us servethe clock (Saturn–Moon) and disconnects us from the infinite NOW. The idea ofages following ages is another version of time moving forward. It may becircular, but so is a hamster wheel. Entering a ‘new age’ confirms a belief inthe illusion of moving forward; but there is no forward, as there is nobackwards; there is only NOW. The Truth Vibrations are not about advancing usinto a new age within the Saturn–Moon Matrix. They are about breaking the veryillusion of the Saturn–Moon Matrix. This is so clear to me sitting here as mymind continues to open to Consciousness. The Magnu information does not speakabout moving into a new age or cycle; it speaks of returning energies –information/consciousness – that were withdrawn for emergency reasons. This fitswith a lot of other information, hints and big pointing fingers that I have beengetting in recent years."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00427.jpg] Figure 348: The perception of Yugas and ‘2012’ cycles are manipulations of theSaturn–Moon Matrix Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) THE ‘END TIMES’ SCAMPeople will have to use their own intuition on this and I am sure that theadvocates of the yuga, New Age and 2012 belief system will dismiss it without asecond thought. This is their right and I respect that, but it makes sense of somuch. Our reality was not supposed to go through dark ages, war, suffering anddeprivation. We are supposed to be living in a world of love, a world withoutlimits. The world is not like that because of the hack. There is no ‘Golden Age’within the hack – that is some distant utopia that never comes because it is notmeant to come. The Real Golden Age is the one that exists beyond the vibrationalprison walls called the ‘speed of light’ and it is decoded from the pure,unhacked information broadcast from the galactic centre. The Reptilian Alliancecannot completely disconnect us from our true self and reality beyond theMatrix. We feel this through our heart and intuition. The hack has to work to alarge extent with what it is hacking into just as a computer hacker has to workwith the computer and its software. In the same way they could not create acompletely new human body. They had to leave many elements necessary for thehuman form to function and be ‘alive’. They have not created a completely newbody as they have not created a completely new reality. What they have done isto hack into both and distort the information fabric within the electromagneticspectrum and the way the body–computer decodes reality within that band. Thewider reality that humans once decoded in the Real Golden Age is denied bygenetic manipulation and the blocking frequencies of the Saturn–Moon Matrix.Some of what we see is ‘out there’, but much of it is manipulated by thetransmissions of the Saturn–Moon Matrix and its holographic implants that lookreal, but aren’t. Mayan and Indus Valley societies from where those time cyclescame were both dominated by the Reptilians and so were others like the ancientEgyptians and the Hopi, from where the Hopi prophecies came that tell a familiarstory about current times. There was much ‘channelling’ of the Reptilian ‘gods’as their sources of information. I have been to Mayan sites in Central Americaand they were a classic Reptilian ‘gods’ society that included the calling cardof blood sacrifice. How very evolved. Their neighbours, the serpent-worshippingAztecs, made human sacrifice the national sport. This is what I wrote earlier: > The Mayan people, in what is now Mexico, say their ancestors were ‘the people> of the serpent’. They talked about a reptilian race that came from the sky to> take over their civilisation and demand human sacrifice. The latter is a> common theme. The reptilian race and their other non-human associates were> perceived as ‘gods’ because of their technological capabilities. Hopi Indians> in the United States talk of their ‘snake brothers’, the ‘sky gods’, who bred> with their women. Indian accounts tell of a Reptilian race called the ‘Sharpa’> that founded civilisation and were the originators of the shockingly racist> Hindu caste system. And look again at what Cathy O’Brien said about her experience with formerMexican President, Miguel de la Madrid: > De la Madrid had relayed the ‘legend of the Iguana’ to me, explaining that> lizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, their> advanced astronomical technology, including sacrifice of virgins, were> supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens> interbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit, they> fluctuated between a human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like> abilities – ‘a perfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders’. De la> Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he> transformed ‘back into an Iguana at will’. Ancient artefacts and works reflecting the cycles of the Time Loop were inspiredby the Reptilian ‘gods’ running the Saturn–Moon Matrix programme. Were theygoing to leave the truth for humans to find – humans they wanted to continue tocontrol, exploit and feed off? Or would a colossal diversion be more likely tomislead minds open enough to see beyond the official ‘norms’? The Hopiprophecies describe a sequence of events leading to the dawning of the ‘fifthworld’. These ‘worlds’ are yugas or Mayan time-cycles under another name. Otherancient peoples have prophecies with the same theme and they are remarkablysimilar to the biblical Book of Revelation with its sequence of seals andtrumpets on the road to a ‘new heaven and new Earth’. Pat Robertson, theludicrous American evangelist and friend of the Bush family, said that cracks inthe Washington Monument caused by a rare earthquake in 2011 could be ‘a signfrom God’ that ‘we’re closer to the coming of the Lord’. He said Biblicalprophecy about the end of the world predicts that there could be potentialdevastation from natural disasters leading up to the ‘return of Jesus’. Here wego. All over the world people of different beliefs have been caught in thismind-trap. Christians are waiting for Armageddon and the return of Jesus;followers of the Hopi prophecies are ticking them off as they happen; and evensome scientists are tracking the cycles to the end of the Mayan Great Cyclealleged to be in 2012. But they are tracking energetic sequences within theSaturn–Moon Matrix frequency band and not in the greater reality beyond itsvibrational walls known as ‘the speed of light’. Albert Einstein (RothschildZionist) said there is no greater speed than the speed of light, and whether byerror or manipulation this has helped to underpin the hack by a belief, ineffect, that there is nothing beyond the hack. We also have the obsession of somany at this time with a ‘12th planet’, called ‘Nibiru’, made famous by thebooks of translations from Sumerian clay tablets by ‘shapeshifter’ ZechariaSitchin (Rothschild Zionist, London School of Economics). Sitchin did not likeme at all because I exposed the Reptilians and their agenda. Nibiru is supposedto be on an elliptical orbit and pass through our part of the solar system every3,600 years. The Internet is full of websites and postings about the imminentreturn of Nibiru, with once again the theme of great destruction and possibleextinction. We are being given so many reasons to fear a coming global nightmareand even the ‘end of the world’. There may well be other planets or dwarf starsconnected with this solar system that we don’t know about, but I don’t buyNibiru, or Planet X as some call it, in the context of what appears in Sitchin’sbooks. It is so difficult to discern what is ‘real’ and what is a projectionwhen you are dealing with holographic illusion; but I am sure we are in for some‘surprises’ in the heavens in many forms. The coming years could well beseriously bumpy to say the least geologically and in terms of extremes ofweather, and challenging in every way, as I have been saying for a long time;but this is not the ‘end of the world’. It is the end of a human perceptionprogram and the old has to go so the new can take its place. The transitionbetween the two is going to be, how can I put it? Well, interesting.The more I know, the deeper the rabbit hole goes; and there is undoubtedly aneffort underway by the Reptilians and their cohorts to massively increase thepower of the Saturn–Moon Matrix to increase the power of the illusion intoMatrix movie-type levels of fake perception when virtually nothing that we seeis ‘real’. This is to block the effect of the returning information source – theTruth Vibrations. A range of prophecies and accounts have laid a trap to allowthe Reptilians to make the prophecies appear to be happening. The energeticcycles that have been identified by researchers are cycles within the Matrixprogramme. One researcher pointed out that a cycle in 1941 was repeated in 2001and he connected this to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and thesurprise attack on 9/11 in 2001. But neither was a ‘surprise’ attack. They wereboth engineered Problem–Reaction–Solutions by the servants of the Matrixfollowing a game plan encoded in the Matrix. The bloodlines are surfing thesecycles to ensure the greatest chance of success. We have to see through this orwe are going to be seriously caught. Look at what is happening. The Christiansbelieve in an unfolding sequence to Armageddon; the New Agers believe in theHopi prophecies; 2012ers believe in the end of the Mayan Great Cycle; Nibirubelievers are waiting for that to destructively arrive. These are all the samebasic story regurgitated. They are planning to project holograms into the sky todepict religious figures ‘returning’, when they have never existed – as with‘Mother Mary’ who appeared in the African sky in 2011. An invasion by ‘aliens’,even whole ‘Planet Nibirus’, brown dwarfs, comets and other manifestations inthe heavens and the sky can be projected holographically by the Saturn–MoonMatrix, HAARP and related technology to look as real as anything else. Please;it is a trap. What we believe, we perceive and therefore create. We are givingpower to the illusion. If they announce a threat from an alien presence orinvasion, don’t believe them. American aerospace executive, Dr Carol Rosin,worked in the 1970s with Dr Wernher von Braun, the German rocket scientist Imentioned earlier, who was employed by NASA after the Second World War. She saidthat he told her when he knew that he was dying of cancer that there was a planto introduce a series of fake enemies to justify the weaponisation of space (anda lot more, in truth). They would be, in order: the Soviet Union; terrorists;Third World country ‘crazies’ – ‘countries of concern’ in current parlance;asteroids; and the last one would be the threat of an ‘alien’ invasion. VonBraun told her not to believe any of this when it happened, because it would allbe a lie and a hoax. Note how these themes have manifested in Hollywood movies.You are going to see increasing promotion of ‘alien invasion’ material in themedia and elsewhere as people are conditioned to believe the lie that would beused to ‘bring the world together’ against a ‘common enemy’ and justify a worldgovernment, world army, etc., etc. The ‘aliens’ aren’t coming – they have beenhere all along, and when benevolent ones involved in removing the Reptiliansmake themselves known (which they will at some point) they will be cast as theevil threat to human existence. I have noticed already that the possibility ofan ‘alien invasion’, which has always been either laughed at or never discussed,is appearing more often in the mainstream. There was even a joint study on thesubject published in 2011 by Pennsylvania State University and the NASAPlanetary Science Division called Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefitor Harm Humanity? A Scenario Analysis. ‘ETI could attack and kill us, enslaveus, or potentially even eat us’, the study said. ‘ETI could attack us out ofselfishness or out of a more altruistic desire to protect the galaxy from us.’We can expect more of this sort of stuff as humanity is prepared for another BigLie. The holographic UFO projections are part of a mass mind-manipulationprogramme called ‘Project Blue Beam’, and so too are the holographicsky-projections of religious figures to be tailored to the dominant religion ofthe region. I have explained Project Blue Beam in previous books and it is allpart of the fake ‘end times’ scenario that includes the Mayan, Hopi and similarinformation and prophecies.Another aspect of this is the changing of the ‘heavens’. There areever-increasing reports as I write of the Moon being out of phase and changingangle. Moon-watchers have said that either the Moon has rotated to the right orthe Earth has rotated to the left. They say this began at the time of the lunareclipse on December 21st, 2010. Note the date, December 21st, the date that manysay is the end of the Mayan Great Cycle on December 21st, 2012. It was the firstlunar eclipse on the winter solstice (summer solstice in the SouthernHemisphere) since 1638. Constellations such as Orion have been reported to bemoving around; and the Inuit people, or ‘Eskimos’, like many others, havereported that the Sun is rising in a different place and stars have changedpositions. Don’t let mainstream science tell you differently, as they will. Youdon’t need a degree in astronomy when you have watched the Sun come up every dayof your life and it is suddenly appearing someplace else to see that there hasbeen a change. The same with ‘sun gazers’ who stare at the Sun as it rises orsets every day and say that it has changed position. It is far more likely, ofcourse, that the Earth has changed position. The Reptilians are also changingthe hologram in the Saturn–Moon Matrix and when they do that they can change thepositions of stars in the projection – just as an operator can do with theprojection of the heavens onto the ceiling of a planetarium. The rabbit hole isso deep; the scale of the illusion is so vast, and we need to appreciate this tograsp what is happening. Magnetic north is moving by the day and this, togetherwith mass bird and fish deaths, is being connected with the ‘End Times’prophecies from various sources that include the same basic themes. The oildisaster in the Gulf of Mexico has been connected to the Hopi end-times prophecyabout the seas turning black. But the moving magnetic north and the massdie-offs could be the work of HAARP and connected technologies making theprophecies appear to be coming true. The Hopi seventh sign is: ‘You will hear ofthe sea turning black, and many living things dying because of it.’ The ninthand final sign is: ‘You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above theearth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Verysoon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease.’ The ‘signs’ andprophecies have been encoded and communicated in the ancient ‘past’ specificallyto make them appear to be happening now and in the next few years. One reasonfor this is to, yet again, manipulate people to give away their powers ofcritical thinking and intuitive knowing to what they believe is an unfolding‘God-driven’ destiny that is playing out when it is all manipulation. Whenpeople believe this they empower the illusion even more and help to create anenergetically self-fulfilling prophecy. Many Christians and Jews will stand backand not challenge horrors imposed by the bloodlines because they believe that itis ‘God’s will’ to fulfil ‘His’ prophecy for ‘Armageddon’, the ‘final battle’between ‘good’ and ‘evil’. Where is Armageddon? In Israel. It is a place knownas ‘Har Megiddo’. I have been saying for years that the plan is to trigger aThird World War in the Middle East involving Israel. Armageddon is the time whenChristians believe that the Messiah will return to earth and defeat theAntichrist/Devil/Satan/Lucifer, but you can be sure that those promoted as the‘good guys’ fighting evil will be the truly evil. It is a movie called ‘Claptrapand Bollocks’ that they are making happen through calculated manipulation. It isnothing to do with ‘God’s will’. How many people have asked the questiongeneration after generation: Why would a loving God allow this or that horror tohappen and even say that it should happen? Answer: A ‘loving God’ doesn’t dothat – the Reptilian ‘gods’ do that in league with the ‘Greys’ and others.Please, please, don’t buy into it. The themes of where we are today are the sameas they always were no matter what the ‘yuga’. Yes, the level of sophisticationand scientific knowledge has moved on; but has the outcome? In ancient timesuntold numbers were killed in wars and mass human sacrifice. Today the warscontinue with far greater killing potential and mass human sacrifice is nowpepper-bombing Baghdad or Tripoli. The Second World War cost 55 million livesonly 70 years ago, and now a third one is being manipulated. Is this really anadvance on what was happening in the alleged nadir of the ‘Dark Age’ in AD 500?Only in the number of dead people – there are more now. Oh, I hear, but we aremuch more compassionate today. So why don’t the fundamentals change? I’m surethere were compassionate people in AD 500, too. It is about Consciousness, notages, and of course energetic changes can affect that, but not to the degreethat the fundamentals change in society as a whole. Those controlling the Matrixdon’t want those fundamentals to change. Instead of fighting to plunder andslaughter, we now describe the same outcome as fighting for peace or protectingcivilians. The Truth Vibrations are impacting upon that perception today – notany yuga or Mayan cycle. Vibrational change is not being directed into ourreality by any new age or cycle, but to break the hack and awaken humanity fromits mental, emotional and vibrational prison cell.REPTILES ON THE BARRICADESThe Reptilians and their human hybrids have been preparing for the challenge ofthe Truth Vibrations, and that is the major motive behind HAARP. They areseeking to (a) stop the Truth Vibrations penetrating our reality to the extentthat they potentially could, and (b) prevent people from tuning into them andbeing awakened by them. HAARP has the potential of encircling the planet with a‘full-body shield’ together with other facilities around the world including theenormous ‘American’ (Cabal) underground base at Pine Gap in central Australia.Bernard Eastlund, the original patents holder for HAARP technology, said thatthe shield could be created with ‘relativistic particles’. These are chargedparticles moving at the speed of light. This, together with GWEN-type technologyon the ground, Smart Grids in the home and workplace, and so on, comprises amulti-level energetic defence shield to the Truth Vibrations. What was calledthe ‘Star Wars’ defence shield, created allegedly to stop incoming missiles, wasprimarily a front for establishing a planetary defence shield to block incominginformation and awareness, and benevolent extraterrestrials/interdimensionals.The Saturn–Moon Matrix operates within a certain frequency band and the more weopen our minds beyond that band the less we are influenced by the transmissions.There was little danger of that before the Truth Vibrations began to open minds,and the Reptilian Alliance has been preparing to resist this change that wouldbring their house down. This is why, at the very point that humans aredemonstrably awakening we are being hit by what is described in this book. Theyneeded to increase the level of mind and emotional suppression to stop peopleexpanding awareness beyond the confines of the Saturn–Moon Matrix. HAARP andassociated technologies are a Matrix support system on Earth manipulating theenergy field with which we interact. CERN’s Large Hadron Collider is involved inthis, too, along with what is happening in the vast and interconnectedunderground bases and cites and those inside gouged-out mountains. Rapidlyincreasing sources of radiation, not least from Fukushima, are also part of thisshield, among other things, and the destabilising of the human bodyreceiver–transmitter system together with chemicals in food and drink, fluoridein drinking water (with lithium on the wish-list), toxic vaccinations andgenetic modification of food. Metals in chemtrails are also connected and so isthe information-distorting pollution of the seas and water sources withchemicals, radiation and what happened with the oil catastrophe in the Gulf ofMexico. This distortion has since been carried on the tidal flows to a muchwider expanse of the world’s oceans. You don’t need to see the oil on thesurface to have information distortion by oil in the sea. This is the sameprinciple that I highlighted earlier with regard to homeopathy. The ingredientsin homeopathic remedies are diluted and diluted until there is no ingredientleft – but the information from the ingredient is still there. The entirereceiver–transmitter systems and information fields of the planet, humanity andeverything else are being attacked from every angle at the moment to block theTruth Vibrations transformation and the demise of the Saturn–Moon Matrix.Nuclear devices exploded in the Van Allen Belts that significantly increasedtheir radiation levels was also part of the multi-faceted defence shield. Thesatellite network is involved in this, too. There is so much going on that wedon’t know about – including a challenge being mounted to those controllingSaturn and the Moon. We are not alone. There is an enormous effort underway toset humanity free and it is happening across multiple dimensions from those wewould call ‘extraterrestrials’ to pure awareness.The Reptilian game plan is this: They establish a vibrational defence shield tomaintain the Earth’s atmosphere within frequency bands that will cause most ofhumanity to remain asleep. They know that some will be conscious enough andopen-minded enough to awaken and that is the reason for the police state andfine-detail surveillance technology and programmes. They are seeking out thosewho are breaking free from the mind prison. The DNA database is being created tohave everybody’s unique frequency on file so they can target the awakeningdirectly on their frequency to either take them out or block their DNAreceiver–transmitter systems. They don’t want such people in their Brave NewWorld. They plan a mass cull of the global population because the currentnumbers, or even a significantly large section, could be lethal to their plans,as I will explain in a moment. I have been saying for nearly 20 years that theplan was to microchip every child at birth. This is to externally control theirreality and vibrational state from the time they enter this world. Their verythoughts would be controlled throughout their lives and any source ofinformation that could open their minds would be blocked or banned. Dr RichardDay, the Rockefeller insider, said in 1969 that ‘books will just disappear fromlibraries’. The Truth Vibrations would not be able to connect with people inthat state and the Earth would be a fully-fledged prison camp serving theinterests and demands of the Reptilians. Movement would be severely restrictedin line with Agenda 21. Think of Chinese society today and multiply the level ofcontrol many, many times and you’ll have something like the world they want toimpose. China today is the basic blueprint, started by Freemason and Illuminatiplaceman, Mao Zedong, but the Brave New World version would be far more extremeand severe. The final ‘end game’ is to change the atmosphere of the planet tobetter suit the Reptilians so that they can more easily openly manifest oncethey have a dramatically smaller population that is mind-controlled to the pointof being nothing more than robotic slaves in the world of Agenda 21. This isanother crucial reason for unleashing all those sources of radiation andpunching holes in the ionosphere – changing the atmosphere to suit theReptilians. They are planning to mutate human genetics to accept a much moreirradiated atmosphere for the half a billion to a billion slaves they wish tosurvive the ‘cull’.WE HAVE THE POWERThere is nothing more important in anyone’s life – I don’t care who it is – thanto focus on the situation that we are facing and what we can do about it.Everything comes from this focus – our own life experience in its entirety andthat of our children and grandchildren. I am 59 as I write this. I won’t beliving in a global prison camp for anything like as long as children and youngpeople today; but I care deeply about what happens to them and every moment ofmy life in this reality is focused on making sure that the nightmare is avoidedand the Matrix dismantled. This is what we have come to do so let’s get on withit. I cannot emphasise enough that we are not alone in this endeavour and we canmake our crucial contribution to this multidimensional effort if we put asidethe manufactured fault lines and divisions of race, religion, culture, ‘class’,politics and income bracket. None of these things matter to the Reptilians andtheir hybrids. To them, they are only tools to engineer the essential ‘divideand rule’. They will enslave Jewish people in the global prison camp as much asthey will Christians, Muslims, Hindus and everyone else. They will kill themequally, too, if they think that it benefits the outcome they are seeking. Putthese divisions aside before we are divided and ruled into concentration campsand what is left of freedom is dispatched to oblivion. We are so close already.The answer is energetic, as the prison is energetic. We have the power, morethan the power, to dismantle the vibrational prison walls if we understand eventhe basics of how it all works. The Control System is not structured by accidentto generate incoherent heart energy and low-vibrational thought and emotion suchas fear, stress, anger, frustration and depression. This is done to maintainhumanity in a low-vibrational, incoherent state that generates the energy theywant, enslaves people in close-minded ignorance and … here’s the big one …projects a constant supply of low-vibrational electromagnetic energy into theEarth energy ‘sea’ in which the Truth Vibrations are now circulating ever morepowerfully. HAARP and all the connecting radiation technologies are being usedto further suppress the vibrational state of that ‘sea’, because that is vitalto their Truth Vibration defence strategy. People would be amazed if they knewthe impact that humans are having on the Earth’s energy field minute by minute.Technology can now measure this, and great spikes occur in the field\"svibrational state when there is a global reaction to something such as 9/11.Obviously, the fear and emotion generated by the 9/11 attacks would have suitedthe goals of the conspirators, and this was another benefit for them; but we canhave an incredible impact on opening the Earth field to the Truth Vibrations andscupper the HAARP brigade and other sources of energetic suppression. We allhave a significant individual effect, but when we get together in groups andvast numbers the effect is extraordinary. Satanists say that they perform theirrepetitive rituals at certain points on the Earth because they leave ‘strongimpressions upon the Morphic Field’. The bloodlines manipulate large gatheringsfor royal weddings, religious rituals and other events to trawl the energy thatis generated. They know the collective power of human energy and they areterrified of its potential. We need to use this energy to bring down the houseof cards and to do this we have to put aside all non-essentials and focus.Another reason that they want a colossal cull of the human population is becausethey are well aware of the potential collective power of the human heart andConsciousness if enough people wake up sufficiently to understand the power thatwe have. I have known for many years that the most important contribution of myall-day speaking events around the world is the collective energy that isgenerated into the Earth’s energy field by a gathering of like-minds andlike-hearts coming together as One.The heart is the key. The heart in its hormonal expression connects with theendocrine system that includes the pineal and pituitary glands in the brainwhich are part of the psychic senses that we call the third eye. The heartprojects the body’s most powerful electromagnetic field, and when it is inharmony with the brain and nervous system we are transformed to a whole newlevel of intelligence, love, mental and emotional balance, clarity of thought,intuitive knowing and connection to higher Consciousness. The heart is at thecentre of everything. This is why the global conspiracy has systematicallytargeted the human heart. People have been sent into my life in an attempt todisrupt me in just this way, but ultimately they failed. The manipulators arefearful of the heart’s true power and they also know what mayhem is causedmentally, emotionally and ‘physically’ when the heart is out of sync with thebrain and the nervous system. They manipulate events to trigger states oflowvibrational, imbalanced emotion. They want us angry, frustrated, fearful,resentful, depressed and irritable. They want us to close our hearts and makethem a bystander in the process of decoding reality and perception. My friend,Mike Lambert, at the Shen Clinic on the Isle of Wight, was telling me about some‘Kirlian’ photographs that he saw which capture activity in the humanenergy-field. He said that so many people were found to have almost no energyactivity around the heart when that area should be an electromagnetic powerstation. This is how the Control System closes people down, disconnects themfrom their infinite self and enslaves them in the five senses. HAARP and all theconnecting radiation technologies are also being used to further suppress thevibrational state of the Earth’s energy ‘sea’ and therefore manipulate the fish– humans – into those same low-vibrational states. This creates a feedback loopas people are influenced into incoherent states by the energy ‘sea’ and thenfeed back these patterns into the ‘sea’ to further empower its negativeinfluence. We have to break that circuit and transform the individual andcollective energy-field from the incoherence that the Control System dependsupon to the coherence that will set us individually and collectively free. Wecan manifest energetic harmony from the manipulated chaos by loving each other.We will do this if enough people will join us in the awakening project that Iwill describe shortly.There is a phenomenon known as ‘hypercommunication’ which means to connect‘individual minds’ on a psychic, intuitive level to form a communicationnetwork. Bushmen in Africa communicate through hypercommunication and so we havethe term ‘bush telegraph’. Researchers of hypercommunication say that if enoughminds (and I would say hearts) connected in this way they would have a‘god-like’ power to create and re-shape the world that we live in. This iscertainly true, especially when you think that human brain activity operates inthe same frequency band as Earth’s resonant frequencies. We are One with theEarth and there is two-way communication. The collective power of human heartsand minds could break the spell of the Matrix and overcome the influence ofHAARP, GWEN, Smart Grids … all of them. They are two-stone weaklings comparedwith the power of the collective human heart and mind/consciousness. This is thepower source of change that has the Control System trembling in its boots. Mindsand hearts connecting as a single whole produce the power in rain dances thatchanges the electromagnetic field to make it rain. We can transform the worldfrom a prison to a paradise merely by focusing together in sufficient numbers torelease the transformative power of the collective human heart and mind. Authorand researcher Bärbel Mohr writes: ‘Whenever a great many people focus theirattention or consciousness on something similar like Christmas time, footballworld championship or the funeral of Lady Diana in England, then certain randomnumber generators in computers start to deliver ordered numbers instead of therandom ones.’ Numbers are digital versions of waveform states. The GlobalConsciousness Project was established in 1998 to study the effect of humanconsciousness on the ‘physical’ world. The project has a network of random eventgenerators on every continent and in more than 50 locations to measure theeffect of human consciousness. Spikes in activity are produced during events ofglobal and national focus. They conclude from the findings so far: ‘The resultsare evidence that the physical world and our mental world of information andmeaning are linked in ways that we don’t yet understand.’ Or maybe we do.Experiments have shown that DNA can imprint information into energy fields, justas flowers and people imprint their information into water. This is called the‘phantom DNA effect’. We can communicate with each other and connect with eachother through heart, consciousness and DNA transmissions, and this is howtelepathy and remote healing is possible. All this is happening beyond what wecall time and space in levels of reality where everything is One. This is theantidote to the Control System and the Reptilian manipulation, but we have toget tens of millions involved.AWAKENING THE WORLD – EVERY HEART MAKES A DIFFERENCEThis brings me to something that I launched through my website:www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com], in July 2011. We need people allover the world in every town, city, village and community to step forward asorganisers of groups and gatherings of people willing to come together regularly– several times a week – to connect their energy fields and project love, peaceand harmony into the atmosphere. The more that come together the better. We needmassive gatherings organised at known ‘sacred sites’ which are perceived as‘sacred’ because they are located at major vortex points where the planetaryimpact is so much greater. I have called this project ‘Awakening the World –Every Heart Makes a Difference’. You will find a section with that name on mywebsite where people all over the world can communicate and organise together.Every day we bring people together at specific times for 20 minutes through thewebsite to connect our hearts and minds, and focus love and heart coherenceeither on the planet in general or a specific place, person or event. We wanttens of millions coming together as soon as possible – hundreds of millionseventually – and what a difference this will make to the world (Fig 349[../Text/index_split_214.html#filepos1558443]). We are diluting the energy offear, anger, hatred and hostility and replacing it with love, peace and harmony– everything the Control System doesn’t want. Please get involved because thiswill change the tide in the hearts of human beings and those that seek tocontrol us. Make a decision to dedicate yourself to this cause and then followyour intuitive knowing and everything will fall into place. The ‘Force’ will bewith you because you have made a decision to connect with the ‘Force’. Thetransformation in other levels of reality as the Reptilians and Greys arechallenged by benevolent extraterrestrials/interdimensionals is already welladvanced. We only need to ground that energy of transformation and freedom inour reality. This is what we came here for. The global population is moving pastseven billion and this is a latent force of incredible power. We need to wake upto that truth and harness that power for the greater good of all. What atransformation there will be if hundreds of millions awakened to their truepower and embarked on the work that I am asking for here (Figs 350[../Text/index_split_215.html#filepos1558796] and 351[../Text/index_split_216.html#filepos1559328]). There is nothing you have to doto take part other than to focus your heart and connect with others to send outlove, peace and harmony into the energetic atmosphere. Organisers of events atsacred sites and other locations just need to let us know the time and place andwe’ll publicise it on my website. The world will benefit in a most fundamentalway from these collective energy transmissions and you will see the worldchanging for the better as the energetic distortions from hate and fear aredissolved along with the effect of that energy on human perception andbehaviour. Wars, engineered catastrophes and financial meltdowns are instigatedfor many reasons, but the most important one is to produce ever more of thatenergy from human reactions and responses. This is also another element of theTruth Vibration defence shield, but this can be countered and far more when wegather together and call in the Truth Vibrations. By doing so, you will connectwith them and become a conduit and transmitter of them in this reality:"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00428.jpg] Figure 349: The collective power of the human heart will bring an end to the ageof enslavement "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00429.jpg] Figure 350: Nothing can escape the transforming energies and information of theTruth Vibrations Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) "},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00430.jpg] Figure 351: The Truth Vibrations are dismantling the energetic foundation of theControl System Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) > As the consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those of you Light> Workers who are working together to raise your consciousness will be able to> hold more and more refined vibrations, and so we will be able to use you as a> catalyst to be able to feed in more and more energies … As more of you raise> yourselves to meet the challenge, so we can awaken more of these energies. This is the profound truth that we need to understand – and fast – to be able tobring down the Control System which depends for its survival on the transmissionof lowvibrational brain/mind energy that it constantly manipulates humanity toproduce. Doing what I am asking for here is not only of crucial benefit to ourcollective reality; it will make transformative changes in everyone whocontributes. Taking the time regularly to sit quietly and focus on heartcoherence and send out love, peace and harmony will manifest as love, peace andharmony within you. This will produce coherence in heart electrical andvibrational activity bringing into harmony the trinity of heart, brain andnervous system. This harmony will unleash your fantastic potential for clearthought and inspired knowing that comes when heart, mind and body are working asone unit. Remember that there are more nerves going from the heart to the brainthan going the other way, and the electrical and magnetic fields of the heartare 60 times stronger (and potentially much more) than the brain. Love,appreciation and caring are 5,000 times more powerful than fear, hate, anger,resentment, frustration and depression. We clearly have the power to change thenature of the Earth’s energy field to create feedback loops of love, peace andharmony to replace the fear, hatred and chaos that we currently have. The ‘head’got us into this mess and the heart, in harmony with the ‘head’, is going to getus out of it. Heart coherence also increases the power of intuition and theimmune system. Everyone’s a winner here. As you give, so you will receive. Mindhas created our prison reality and heart will set us free of that. The heartwill always find a way. Mind is supposed to serve heart, not marginalise andsuppress it.FOLLOWING THE SCRIPTWe live in an illusion within an illusion – the Matrix hack within thevirtual-reality Universe. As I have explained, the ‘Queen Bee’ (Saturn–Moon)broadcasts the waveform information ‘hack’ that activates, or ‘hacktivates’, theReptilian program within ‘junk’ DNA and blocks other parts of the DNA and thehuman decoding system so that we see what they want us to see and don’t see whatwe would otherwise see. We can be completely controlled by the Matrix and be nomore than human robots responding to data input, or we can open our hearts andminds and see beyond what others can see. Secret-society rituals are designed tolock their initiates into the Matrix broadcasts even more powerfully, and theseare the people who mostly administer the system, run the banks and corporationsand end up in political power. If you tap into the program through one of themajor secret-society terminals, such as the Fabian Society, you can writeincredibly prophetic books like George Orwell and Aldous Huxley did, because theplan has been encoded in the Saturn–Moon Matrix and human DNA for thousands ofyears. The only way out of this for humanity is to break the hack and deny thesystem the low-vibrational energy that it needs. Multiple levels of reality areworking to this end. We have to play our part from within the hack and thatmeans opening our hearts and minds to the Truth Vibrations and starting againwith a blank sheet of paper when it comes to what we think that we know. Whatpeople ‘know’ is what the Matrix has programmed them to know. Questioneverything no matter how long you have believed it. If it doesn’t stand up toexamination then ditch it – religious belief, political belief, reality belief;it’s all Matrix claptrap. We need to start again and this time let the truth inthrough the heart – intuition, knowing – and break free of the head where theMatrix overwhelmingly seizes control. Head domination = Matrix. Heart domination= freedom from the Matrix.The first step is to believe nothing and question everything that you think youknow. Question everything that you have read in this book, too. What I havewritten makes no claim to be definitive, because there is always more to know.Nor will it be 100 per cent accurate in every detail. How could it be in thesuppressed and manipulated energetic environment that we experience daily, andwhen those in control are doing everything they can to block information thatwould expose them? But I am very confident about the themes, and when it comesto what is happening with the global conspiracy within five-sense reality thetruth of this can now be seen in daily events. What I said would happen in booksnearly 20 years ago is happening. People will have to use their intuition aboutthe Matrix and the hack. Does it make sense of the world? Does it feel right? Ifnot, sling it. We are in the end times of belief, or we had better be. Peoplesay that we must believe something. But why? I believe nothing. I have aperception of how things are at any point, but I don’t believe it in the senseof the perception being so immovable that it solidifies into a belief. There isonly the way that I see things in any moment, in the full knowledge that thereis always, but always, more to know. My perception is constantly fluid and moveson with new events, experiences and information. This is what I mean by notbelieving anything. Current perception and belief are not the same. Fluidity ofperception is a manifestation of the heart intuitively dancing with the Universeand beyond seeking out ever more awareness. Dogmatic belief is mind, the head –the Matrix. The head is a good servant, but a terrible master. Breaking out ofthe prison of belief is essential for another reason – our feedback relationshipwith the Matrix. If we believe what the Matrix tells us to believe we thencommunicate that same belief back to the Matrix and empower its effect when itis refed back to us. The feedback relationship means that we aremind-controlling ourselves in many ways and empowering the Matrix with beliefsystems that can be used to influence others to believe the same. You break thiscycle when you move from belief into ‘this is my perception in this moment, butI know it is nothing like the whole story and I am constantly open to revisingmy perception in the light of experience and information’. People are held fastin the feedback loops by a belief in religion, politics, science and all thepillars of perception control. Thousands of protesters demanding ‘freedom’ onthe streets of Egypt were on their collective knees several times a day facingMecca – the Kaaba cube (Saturn). Freedom? (Fig 352[../Text/index_split_217.html#filepos1568186]) They are so confused they don’tknow what freedom is; and I see the same in America where many Christianpatriots demanding freedom are self-enslaved by self-identifying with being botha Christian and a patriot. They have forgotten that being a ‘Christian’ and a‘patriot’ are experiences and not who they are – Consciousness. A self-identityof being a Christian and a patriot is to self-identify with limitation andbody–mind. The same applies to all religions and self-identities based on humanconcepts and experiences."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00431.jpg] Figure 352: Many Egyptians who campaigned for ‘freedom’ broke off from theirprotests several times a day to get on their knees and face the Kaaba cube(Saturn). They want ‘freedom’? Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) WHO AM I?We need a total transformation in the perception of ‘self’ to free us from theMatrix programs which feed us the belief that we are only a powerless ‘LittleMe’. The Matrix wants us to believe that we are only our body, name, job andlife story, or that we are answerable to some ‘God’ that we must serve andplease. We must stop giving the Matrix what it wants and start giving it what itdoesn’t want. This means ending our self-identity with the body and Matrixsymbols such as name, job and income bracket. They are not who we are; they arewhat we are experiencing. What we are is Infinite Consciousness and Awarenesshaving those experiences. Our point of observation and awareness moves away frombody–mind and into Consciousness when we change our self-identity from body–mindto Consciousness. We are then in this world ‘physically’, but not of this worldin terms of the point of awareness from which we observe it. We start to seewhat we couldn’t see before – including how we can best contribute to humanfreedom. Consciousness speaks to us most powerfully through the heart in ourintuition and knowing, and this must be our guide if we are to overcome theprisons and delusions of mind. No matter what you think; what do you feel? Whatdo you know? The system has desensitised people from a connection to heartawareness, because the Reptilians and their hybrids know the consequences of aheart-inspired humanity for their plans for total global control. They mustentrap us in mind–head for that collective control to be possible. Turn off thetelevision to stop that fundamental source of subliminal programming; andinstead of mind-numbing games shows, reality shows and twisted ‘news’, spend thetime sitting quietly and accessing your true and infinite power. The more youfocus on life and self through the heart the more powerful it will become – youwill become – and the more intuitive and knowing you will be. The Illuminati sayin their own documents that the only danger to their plans is what they call‘maverick people’; and truly maverick people are heart people. They areunpredictable, intuitive and inspired. They are guided by Consciousnessunmolested by the predictable programs of the ‘I can’t’ mind. Words do notsuffice to express the importance of humanity becoming heart-centred andheart-guided. We are being bombarded with reasons to feel fear, worry, anxiety,stress, anger and frustration. All these emotional states close down the heartcentre and disturb a coherent energetic and information connection betweenheart, brain and nervous system. This dilutes the energetic power of the heartand allows the brain to control perception. We need to transform our interactionwith the Matrix and what we call Life. We need to remain calm when the mindwants to panic or ‘lose it’ in the face of events and personal experience. Whenthese things happen, remember that you are Infinite Awareness having anexperience. This will help you to be an observer of the experience rather thanbeing the experience. The emotional impact of the experience will then be somuch less traumatic. Those that choose to take part in ‘Awakening the World’groups and mass-focus every day will find that their ability to detach willincrease all the time. Anyone can sit quietly and move their point of attentionto the heart. You will feel such calmness and the intuitive inspiration willflow. We must stay calm through what is coming, because there are going to manychallenges, shocks and surprises. The Reptilian Alliance and their bloodlinehybrids are going to be pushing on with their Control System for a while yet andthey will be orchestrating events to keep people in fear and bewilderment whilequite possibly making the prophecies and the 2012 belief system appear to behappening. At the same time we are going to be seeing the gathering impact ofthe Truth Vibrations on the human awakening and in terms of dramatic solaractivity, earthquakes and volcanoes that are not caused by HAARP, but bysomething changing in the Earth’s crystal core as a result of the changingenergetic environment. This is what I was told would happen in 1990. We need tobe heart-centred enough not to be pulled in by all the reasons to be fearfulthat will be thrown at us. If we react to what is happening – and planned – withanger, resentment, hatred and fear we will be feeding the Matrix with preciselythe energy it requires to pollute the energy ‘sea’ with those emotional fieldsthat will influence others to feel and react in the same way. I have watchedpeople who were fine and happy go into a room (energy field) filled with angerand hostility and very soon they start reacting in the same way. This ishappening to humanity second by second. We are manipulated to fill the energysea with toxic emotional fields and other people are influenced by that toproduce more of the same energy and the downward spiral goes on. We have tobreak the circuit.BEYOND PROTEST – THE NON-COMPLI-DANCEThis brings me to protests. They serve a purpose as an expression of publicopinion, but how many protests change anything? Upwards of half-a-million peopleor more protested in the streets of London against the imminent invasion of Iraqin 2003, but Iraq was still invaded. There were mass protests in the same cityin 2011 over criminal levels of student fees for college and university courses,but the fees were still raised. How many ‘million-people marches’ have therebeen to Washington D.C. and how many changed a thing? Greeks were in the streetsin great numbers in 2011 opposing the draconian austerity programmes imposed bytheir government on the insistence of the European Union and IMF. What happened?The measures were passed into law. Protests don’t frighten the bloodlines. Forgoodness sake, they have been manipulating them in North Africa and the MiddleEast and earlier in Eastern Europe. They allow the cover of ‘people power’ tohide their calculated manipulations and when protests become violent, oftenthrough bloodlines’ agents provocateurs, they have the excuse to further imposea police state. Angry protests also do what? They add still more of that energyto the Earth energy-sea that is already full to overflowing with it. Thebloodlines want people to protest in this way, as we saw in London and otherBritish cities in 2011. It gives them precisely what they want. Imagine thepower of replacing stand-up, angry protests with sit-down silent focus wherethousands join their hearts together and send out the energy of love and peace,which is thousands of times more powerful than anger and resentment. Instead ofshouting slogans or abuse at the authorities and police, we just sit down ingreat numbers and silently focus on the heart. The impact of this all over theworld day after day, week after week for as long as it takes would beincredible. And that’s the point – as long as it takes. The only reallyeffective protests are persistent and long-term and not one day and it’s over.The protest, as an ‘occupation’, then becomes a form of non-cooperation with theoppressors and that is precisely what we need (so long as it is genuine and notCabal-orchestrated for its own ends). I am not saying that everything willchange overnight from ‘heart gatherings’ or from ‘Awakening the World’. TheEarth’s energy field is very polluted and very sick and the effect of what I amasking for is cumulative; but transformation will come and ever more powerfullyand obviously as we continue day after day, week after week, month after monthand the numbers involved increase dramatically. This is what the bloodlines fear– not banner-waving anger. The Chinese government has waged a campaign ofgrotesque persecution against the Falun Gong movement – which combinesmeditation with exercises to calm the body and open the heart. Falun Gong alsopromotes truthfulness, compassion and forbearance. The bloodlines know thepotential consequences for the Control System of this becoming widespread andthey banned the practice when by 1999 there were 70 million people involved –more than were in the Chinese Communist Party. The sad, sick and ignorantChinese dictators declared Falun Gong a ‘heretical organisation’ andpractitioners have been jailed and suffered horrific torture and psychiatricabuse. What are they so afraid of? – Heart energy and awakening toConsciousness. This is their worst nightmare, as I said earlier. How about westop protesting against things and start campaigning for things? Instead ofbeing anti-war, let us be pro-peace. Instead of being anti-New World Order oranti-globalisation, let us be for freedom and justice for all. This may seempedantic – but it isn’t. A small change in wording and emphasis can mean afundamental change in perception and energy that is generated for the cause.There is another aspect of ‘Awakening the World – Every Heart Makes aDifference’ and this is what I call the Non-compli-dance. If you riot andprotest with anger, resentment and hostility, the Control System says ‘thank youvery much’. Let us give them exactly what they don’t want, what they areterrified of – unleashed collective human energetic power. Instead of angryprotest let us quietly focus on the heart and send out love, peace and harmonyinto the energy field with which we constantly interact – and then let us DANCEtogether with love, joy and laughter: the non-compli-dance. The energetic impactof this on yourself and the world will be amazing (Fig 353[../Text/index_split_218.html#filepos1579941]). Let us dance with love, joy andlaughter and give that energy of love and harmony even more power as we swirland twist our electromagnetic fields to whip up the electromagnetic energy-seaand make it dance with electrical power on the vibration of love and harmony.‘Awakening the World – Every Heart Makes a Difference’ and the non-complidance.Together in love and harmony we are unstoppable. The Rothschilds have alreadycancelled the laxative order. We need to do this constantly and in our tens ofmillions – hundreds of millions all over the world."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00432.jpg] Figure 353: The non-compli-dance Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) There is something else that the bloodlines and their masters are terrified of –non-cooperation. I see people marching in protest against something and thenthey go home and continue to cooperate with the building of their collectiveprison. What use is that? There are so few controllers in full knowledge of whatthey are doing compared with the seven billion in the target population. Theyhave to recruit from that population the law enforcement and administrators toimpose their agenda. There are simply not enough of them to do it alone. When westop cooperating with our own enslavement, and those in dark suits and uniformsstop building a prison for themselves and their children and grandchildren, thehouse of cards will fall. We need to organise people together in large numbersto cease to ‘comply’ with anything that advances the agenda for mass humancontrol. We have to do this in large numbers or the few will be picked off.Scale is what we need. Those who are not directly involved need to support thosewho are. Here are some examples and there are countless others: When homes areforeclosed by the banks because of the behaviour of the banks in crashing theeconomy, people refuse to leave and the non-foreclosed support them. If peopledid this in their hundreds of thousands and millions the system would collapse.It couldn’t cope. We refuse to allow Smart Grids to be installed in our homes tobathe us permanently in radiation and control our minds. Don’t let anyone intoyour home from Smart Grids and get together with others to peacefully stopanyone installing anything on the outside. How would the Smart Gridders cope ifthey faced this at millions of homes? They couldn’t. It must be clear from whatyou have read in this book that debate and dialogue is irrelevant to thesebloodline agents and gofers. They have an agenda and nothing is going to stop itunless we do. If you are involved in anything connected to these bloodlines andtheir agents in power, refuse to cooperate. Boycott anything that they areinvolved with. It is your right to choose what you will and will not do. Don’tgo to college or university until the fees are vastly reduced or deletedaltogether. This will impact on the system – not a day on the streets givingthem the energy that they want. You might not pass your exams? Well, is this notpreferable to a lifetime of debt? Life does not begin and end with a piece ofpaper confirming your degree of programming. Refuse to vote in politicalEl-ections. But the ‘other side’ might get in? It doesn’t matter – there is onlyone side under different names. It doesn’t matter who you vote for because theHidden Hand is always El-ected. You only have to look around to see all thedifferent ways that we can refuse to cooperate, refuse to comply, and sendshockwaves through a system that depends for its survival on our compliance. Weneed to dance to a new vibrational beat in the non-compli-dance, which is notonly about dancing, but noncompliance. Come on people, we need to get thisorganised; and not tomorrow – now. Instead of protesting outside governmentbuildings where the oil rags of the system work, go directly to the engineers ofthe conspiracy, the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Soros, Brzezinski, and theothers. Find out where they are making public appearances and peacefully exposethem and send them love to balance their loveless existence. These people areseeking to kill you and your kids and enslave whoever is left in ways that evenOrwell understated. Why are we just leaving them to get on with it?"},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00433.jpg] Figure 354: What are you doing down there? Human race get off your knees Every day you can see hundreds of sheep controlled by a shepherd (authorityfigure) and a sheep dog (fear). They trot along with a baa, baa, baa, complyingwith commands, conceding to fear and mostly merely following the one in frontbecause this is what they have been programmed to do. I have, of course, justdescribed how humanity is controlled. We obey authority either mindlessly orthrough fear of the consequences of not doing so. ENOUGH! The shepherd and thesheepdog have no power over the sheep except for the power that the sheep giveaway to them. What would happen if those sheep went off in any direction theychose and refused to comply with the shepherd and the sheepdog? Very few wouldhave to do this before the perceived power of the shepherd and sheepdog wasexposed for what it really is – non-existent. Their power to enforce behaviouron the sheep comes not from them, but from the sheep conceding their power anduniqueness to them. Human sheep need to stop doing this and everything willchange, but don’t think about it forever – do it. We need to move on this. Thereis a tidal wave of control about to descend – it is already happening – and weneed to smack it straight back at them through exposure, non-compliance andnon-cooperation. Human race get off your knees! (Fig 354).UNIFORMS AWAKENAll of the above applies even more profoundly to those in uniform andsystem-administration who are not knowingly seeking to impose mass humanenslavement. This means the great majority who follow orders and Matrix DNAimpulses who are pawns in a game they don’t understand. A message to everysoldier in the world: You are not serving your country; you are serving theforces that are in the process of destroying your country and establishing apermanent prison state for you, your children and grandchildren. Every time youfire a gun or enforce a freedom-busting law on the system’s behalf, you arefurther condemning your children to a nightmare. How does that feel? This has tobe faced, my friends, or you will complete the job. It is time to walk away, totake another path; or stay in your job and do it differently as a publicservant, not a bloodline enforcer. You are serving a system that doesn’t careany more about you than it does the rest of us. All that ‘support the troops’stuff is only to manipulate you and the public into fighting and supporting warsof conquest and slaughter. They hang you out to dry once you are no longer anyuse to them because of trauma to mind and body. Since 2001, 26,000 Americansoldiers have been pressured and manipulated into signing a ‘personalitydisorder’ discharge when they have been injured in combat. This extraordinarymendacity and callousness saved the US government $14.2 billion in disabilityand medical benefits. This is what they really think of you, soldier. ‘Supportthe troops’, eh? Sergeant Chuck Luther told the US Committee of House VeteransAffairs in 2010 about his treatment by the government and military after he wasseverely wounded and blinded by mortar fire. Sergeant Luther had been servingfor ‘dozens of years’ and won 22 honours, but all that counted for nothing whenhe was no longer fit to fight for the orchestrators of tyranny. Doctors pressedhim to sign documents which said that his blindness was caused by a pre-existingcondition – personality disorder. Once you sign these forms you will receive nodisability benefits or long-term medical care. Luther rightly refused and wasthen placed in a storage closet for more than a month under enforced sleepdeprivation until he signed the documents. This is a man wounded and blinded inaction. He told the House Committee: > I was assaulted, held down, had my pants ripped from the left thigh and given> an injection of something that put me to sleep. When I awoke I was strapped> down to a combat litter and had a black eye and cuts to my wrist from the zip> ties. I was under guard 24/7. > I was constantly called a piece of crap, a faker and other derogatory things.> They kept the lights on and played all sorts of music from rap to heavy metal> very loud all night. These were some of the tactics that we would use on> insurgents that we captured to break them to get information and confessions. > I went through this for four weeks and the … Commander told me to sign this> discharge and if I didn’t they would keep me there for six more months and> then kick me out when we got back to Fort Hood. Anyway, I said I didn’t have a> personality disorder and he told me if I signed the paperwork that I would get> back home and get help and I would have all my benefits. After the endless> nights of sleep deprivation, harassment and abuse, I finally signed just to> get out of there. I was broken. Real journalist Joshua Kors featured Chuck Luther’s story in The Nation magazineunder the telling headline: ‘Disposable Soldiers’. He told the committee ofother such cases. A soldier who was wounded by a rocket and won the Purple Heartwas told that his deafness, which wasn’t there before the rocket attack, wascaused by ‘personality disorder’. A sergeant who had his legs and arms puncturedby grenade shrapnel was told that the injuries were caused by ‘personalitydisorder’ when the only personality disorder in sight applied to the person whowas telling him this. A female soldier was told that profuse vaginal bleedingwas caused by personality disorder by these military doctors-for-sale. Civiliandoctors removed her uterus and appendix, but the military still insisted thateverything was caused by ‘personality disorder’. This denied her all benefitsand she and her daughter ended up homeless. She had called Joshua Kors becauseshe feared that her daughter would be raped at their homeless shelter. TheCommittee hearing was also treated to the truly despicable behaviour ofRepublican Steve Buyer who walked out in outrage that the army’s reputation wasbeing sullied. Now here is some real personality disorder. He said: > I also would say this, I would never, even when I was chairman of a> sub-committee or a full committee, ever put a reporter on a panel to testify.> I would never do that. I think it’s pretty shocking that you would even come> here and provide testimony with regard to someone’s medical condition. You’re> not a doctor. If you were a doctor they would knock you right upside the head> for that. I’m not gonna do this, I can’t, my integrity as a gentleman will not> permit me to do this … I will not participate, I’m not gonna do it, I’m not> going to do it, it’s wrong. But what the army has done to Chuck Luther and 26,000 other soldiers is notwrong? It certainly wasn’t Buyer’s ‘integrity’ that made him walk out, so whatcould it have been? Disgusting. But this is what they think of you, people inuniform, including those at the TSA who are being irradiated to death byfull-body scanners. British troops are killing and being killed in now numerous‘theatres of war’, bombing civilians and fighting fake ‘enemies’ while back athome their families live on military bases in often slum accommodation. HenryKissinger encapsulated what the bloodlines really think of ‘the troops’ when hesaid that military men were ‘dumb, stupid animals’ to be used as pawns forforeign policy. British Prime Minister David Cameron also let the truth slipwhen he said in response to members of the armed forces questioning his policy:‘You do the fighting and I’ll do the talking.’ This is how they see ‘thetroops’. We’ll decide who you kill and you just do it without question. How muchlonger are you going to take it? When they try to bring in a compulsory militarydraft for their expanding wars of conquest, there must be a mass refusal.Cameron is the classic born-into-privilege narcissist who has never seen abullet fired in anger. He’d probably run home crying to his mum if he ever did.Military and police of the world – they don’t give a shit about you. You arejust their enforcers, and the same with the dark-suits who administer the systemfor them. You and your families will end up in servitude the same as everybodyelse if you continue to serve the system that has your families in its sights.You are already enslaved, but too enslaved to see it.THE TIME IS NOWThe situation that we face is already dire, but far, far from hopeless. Are youkidding? The 'game' has only just begun as we at last understand the 'game'.Life is about choice and consequence, choice and consequence. This is theessential experience that gives us the chance to see through the illusion. Wemake different choices, we have different consequences. We make differentcollective choices, we have different collective consequences. You – we – arethe key to everything. We are the 'world' and the 'world' is us. It is acollective holographic reflection of us – and so we can change it anytime wewant. What are we waiting for? The Agenda was meant to be much more advancedthan it is, but something went badly wrong for them in the unseen realms in theperiod around the turn of the Millennium. Rituals were happening in concert allover the world at that time to more fiercely enslave the human psyche, but theydidn’t work as planned. There is also a challenge well advanced to the ReptilianAlliance by other non-human groups both in this reality and others. So all isnot lost, quite the opposite, but further prevarication isn’t an option. We haveto come together, release the lion within us, say ‘no more,’ and get on with it(Fig 355 [../Text/index_split_220.html#filepos1595934]). We have to takeresponsibility for our lives and the world that we are helping to create."},{"pageContent":" image [../Images/00434.jpg] Figure 355: It is time to stand up and look the suppressors in the eye. Enough! Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) People don’t like responsibility; they would much rather blame someone else fortheir plight. But look at what we are doing when we machine-gun blame in alldirections. We are saying that we don’t have control over our lives – the peoplewe are blaming do. Talk about giving your power away. We take that power backwhen we take responsibility because that is a statement that says: ‘I am incontrol of my life. I created what I don’t like and so I can create somethingdifferent.’ We can do this collectively now to change the world and bring downthe Control System. The Reptilians and their bloodline hybrids are notomnipotent and all-powerful. They are in a tiny box of perception called Mind.Their state of being – insecurity, fear, the need to control, a desire for havepower over others – will always deny them access to higher levels of awareness.They have had to develop their mind/intellect to an advanced level, and this iswhy they impose their control so much through technological means and control ofthe mind – the same with the Greys. Humans can advance beyond the ControlSystem’s potential for perception when we open our minds and hearts toConsciousness. The Reptilians have manipulated humanity into a smaller box thanthey are in themselves, but we have the potential to escape this suppression ifwe go back to that blank sheet of paper without belief or preconceived ideas andlet the Truth Vibrations fill our hearts and minds. The intent to connect withthis transformative energy/information automatically connects you. You then haveto decide if you are going to follow the intuitive urgings and knowing that willbegin to flow (Fig 356). This is not rocket science or some complicated, complexprocess. I roll my eyes when I hear these long-drawn-out explanations by gurusof every kind telling people to do this, that and the other to become‘enlightened’. We are enlightened; it is our natural state. We only have toremove the barriers of belief and programming that entrap us in Mind and denyaccess to Consciousness. Free yourself from belief and programmed perceptionswith the blank sheet of paper and state the intent to be connected with theTruth Vibrations and your higher levels of awareness. Then follow your intuitiveknowing that you feel in your heart and everything else will take care of itselfin the synchronistic sequences that follow. Clear your mind of all the clutterthat doesn’t matter. Imagine that you have ten minutes to live and you arelooking back on your life. What really mattered? What was really important? Didit matter that the guy cut you up at the lights and made you get home a minutelater than you would have done? Nope. Did it matter what somebody said to you orabout you years ago, or even last week? Nope. Did it matter that your footballteam lost a big game, or even won it? Nope. What matters in that situation ishow much you loved and were loved; how much joy and happiness you gave to othersand others gave to you. Well, you don’t have ten minutes to live, but you willfill your life with a whole lot more joy, contentment, love and happiness if youtake that deathbed perception with you from hereon in. We allow ourselves to beconstantly diverted into low-vibrational emotional states by things that simplydon’t matter. Mountains out of molehills, as they say. It’s all diversion; theresult of programmed responses and the tidal wave of low-vibrational thought andemotion in the energy ‘sea’. The reptilian brain is, not surprisingly, a majoraccess point for the Saturn–Moon Matrix and we can dramatically reduce itsinfluence if we stay calm and stop reacting. The lizard brain doesn’t think – itreacts; and it triggers actions before rational thought has had time to form. Wecan break that pattern if we count to 10 or 20, or whatever number it takesuntil the reactive reptilian-brain response has passed. It doesn’t usually takemore than a few seconds before the thought process kicks in. Nothing holds thelizard brain in check more than the coherent electrical fields of the heart.Everything comes from moving out of mind into Heart Consciousness. Just as youcannot solve problems with the same level of Consciousness that created them, tochange the world we have to transcend the mind that created this cosmic lunaticasylum. We are the world and the world is us. When we change, the world mustchange – and the heart holds the key. I would also emphasise this: no matterwhat they do to our food and drink or what they throw at us in terms of HAARP,radiation and all the rest – Consciousness can overcome it all. For, in the end,it is all an illusion and Consciousness can control the illusion. I would alsosay that you don’t have to constantly meditate, practice yoga, Tai Chi, ‘breatheproperly’, go on a fast or whatever to open Mind to Consciousness. You just doit. I have never been involved in any of these things and the nearest I evercome to meditation is sitting quietly and ‘having a ponder’. I know that theiradvocates, practitioners and gurus will say no, you must do this or that to‘connect’. That is their right. I am not saying don’t do these things if theyfeel good to you. I am saying it is not necessary. So many people make theprocess of awakening to our true self sound so complicated. It isn’t. It is adecision to awaken to Consciousness followed by listening to your intuitiveknowing (heart) and letting it guide you through the experiences (not all ofthem ‘nice’) that take you home. No crystals or incense necessary. They can bepleasant to have around, but they are not necessary. The process is far simplerthan so many make out.image [../Images/00435.jpg] Figure 356: Open your heart and you go beyond the Matrix Illustration by Neil Hague (www.neilhague.com [http://www.neilhague.com]) It is vital that we don’t focus on the Reptilian Control System succeeding inits goal. We will give it more power though the feedback loop if we do. We makeprophecies more likely to happen if we believe them. We need to clear our mindsof any idea that the Reptilians will succeed; and clear them, too, of Mayanprophecies, Hopi prophecies, Nostradamus prophecies, Book of Revelationprophecies – all of them. We need to focus our hearts and minds instead onknowing that we are changing the world from the prison that it is to theparadise it once was and will be again. I didn’t come here to make a few wavesand leave. I came here with others in multiple realities to bring down theControl System and allow freedom and limitless possibility to reign. Millions ofchildren have come here in the last few decades with awakened consciousness.They are often referred to as ‘indigo children’ and they retained their knowingas they crossed the vibrational divide. Would they be doing that if all that waswaiting for them was a global prison camp? They are here to build the new worldwhen the long era of human slavery is no more (Fig 357[../Text/index_split_221.html#filepos1605045]). The Control System is comingdown. It won’t seem like that for a while yet, but its time is coming to an end.Know it. Be it. The energetic schism, or distortion, on which the Control Systemis founded, is being healed by the Truth Vibrations and so the vibrational sandsare shifting under its very foundations (Fig 358[../Text/index_split_222.html#filepos1605579]). The Reptilians and their hybridsare going to do everything they can to hold on and make their plans succeed, butwe must not allow that possibility to manifest in our sense of reality – onlythat human enslavement ends and humanity awakens to its true and glorious self(Fig 359 [../Text/index_split_223.html#filepos1606073]).
