[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"NASA Masonic ConspiracyApollo Missions Masonic Symbols An excerpt from Wm Cooper's site http://www.williamcooper.com/majestyt.htm To make interstellar travel believable NASA was created. The Apollo Space Program foisted the idea that man could travel to, and walk upon, the moon. Every Apollo mission was carefully rehear sed and then filmed in large sound stages at the Atomic Energy Commission s Top Secret test site in the Nevada Desert and in a secured and guarded so und stage at the Walt Disney Studios within which was a huge scale mock-up of the moon. All names, missions, landing sites, an d events in the A pollo Space Program echoed the occult metaphors, rituals, and symbology of the Illuminati's secret religion. The most transparent was the faked explosion on the spacecraft Apollo 13, named \"Aquarius\" (new age) at 1:13 (1313 military time) on April 13, 1970 which was the metaphor for the in itiation ceremony involving the death (explosion), placement in the coffin (peri od of uncertainty of their survival), communion with the spiritual world and the imparting of esoteric knowledge to the candidate (orbit and observation of the moon without physical contact), rebirth of the initiate (solution of prob lem and repairs), and the raising up (of the Phoenix, the new age of Aquarius) by the grip of the lions paw (reentry and recovery of Apollo 13). 13 is the numb er of death and rebirth, death and reincarnation, sacrifice, th e Phoenix, the Christ (pe rfected soul imprisoned in matter), and the transition from the old to the new. Another revelation to those who understand the symbolic language of the Illuminati is the hidden meaning of the names of the Space Shuttles, \"A Colombian Enterprise to Endeavor for the Discovery of Atlanti s... and all Challengers shall be destroyed.\" Exploration of the moon stopped becaus e it was impossible to continue the hoax without being ultimatel y discovered. And of cour se they ran out of pre- filmed episodes. No man has ever ascended higher than 300 miles, if that high, above the Earth's surface. No man has ever orbited, land ed on, or walked upon the moon in any publicly known space program. If man has ever truly been to the moon it has been done in secret and with a far different technology. The tremendous radiation encountered in the Van Allen Belt, solar radiation, cosmic radiation, temperature control, and many other problems connected with space travel prevent living orga nisms leaving our atmosphere with our"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"known level of technology. Any intellig ent high school stud ent with a basic physics book can prove NASA faked the Apollo moon landings If you doubt this please explain how the astronauts walked upon the moons surface enclosed in a space suit in full sunlight absorbing a minimum of 265 degrees of heat surrounded by a vacuum. NASA tells us the moon has no atmosphere and that the astronauts we re surrounded by the vacuum of space. Heat is defined as the vibration or m ovement of molecules within matter. The faster the molecular motion the highe r the temperature. The slower the molecular motion the colder the temperatur e. Absolute zero is that point where all molecular motion ceases. In order to have hot or cold molecules must be present. A vacuum is a condition of nothin gness where there are no molecules. Vacuums exist in degrees. Some scientists tell us that there is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Space is the closes t thing to an absolute vacuum that is known to us. There are so few molecule s present in most areas of what we know as \"space\" that any co ncept of \"hot\" or \"cold\" is impossible to measure. A vacuum is a perfect insulator. That is why a \"Thermos\" or vacuum bottle is used to store hot or cold liquids in or der to maintain the temperature for the longest time possible withou t re-heating or re-cooling. Radiation of all types will travel through a vacuum but will not affect the vacuum. Radiant heat from the sun trav els through the vacuum of space but does not \"warm\" space. In fact the ra diant heat of the sun has no affect whatsoever until it strikes matter. Mol ecular movement will increase in direct proportion to the radiant en ergy which is absorbed by matter. The time it takes to heat matter exposed to direct sunlight in space is determine d by its color, its elemental properties, its distance from the sun, and its rate of absorption of radiant heat energy. Space is NOT hot. Space is NOT cold. Objects which are heated cann ot be cooled by space. In order for an object to cool it must first be removed from dir ect sunlight. Object s which are in the shadow of another object wi ll eventually cool but not because space is \"cold\". Space is not cold. Hot and cold do not exist in the vacuum of space. Objects cool because the laws of motion dictate that the molecules of the object will slow down due to the resistance result ing from striking other molecules until eventually all motion will stop provided th e object is sheltered from the direct and/or indirect radiation of the sun a nd that there is no o ther source of heat. Since the vacuum of space is the perfect insulator objects take a very long time to cool even when removed from all sources of heat, radiated or otherwise. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NASA insists the space suits the astrona uts supposedly wore on the lunar surface were air conditione d. An air conditioner ca nnot, and will not work without a heat exchanger. A heat exch anger simply takes heat gathered in a medium such as freon from one place a nd transfers it to another place. This requires a medium of molecules which can absorb and transfer the heat such as an atmosphere or water. An air conditioner will not and cannot work in a vacuum. A space suit surrou nded by a vacuum cannot tr ansfer heat from the inside of the suit to any other place. The vacuum, remember, is a perfect insulator. A man would ro ast in his suit in such a circumstance. NASA claims the spacesuits were cool ed by a water system which was piped around the body, then through a system of coils sheltered from the sun in the backpack. NASA claims that water was sprayed on the coils causing a coating of ice to form. The ice then supposedly ab sorbed the tremendous heat collected in the water and evaporated into space. There are two problems with this that cannot be explained away. 1) The amount of water needed to be carried by the astronauts in order to make this work for even a very small length of time in the direct 55 degrees over the boiling point of water (210 degrees F at sea level on Earth) heat of the sun could not have poss ibly been carried by the astronauts. 2) NASA has since claimed that they found ice in moon craters. NASA claims that ice sheltered from the direct rays of the sun will NOT evaporate destroying their own bogus \"air co nditioning\" explanation. Remember this. Think about it the ne xt time you go off in the morning with a \"vacuum bottle\" filled with hot coffee. Think about it long an d hard when you sit down and pour a piping hot cup from your thermos to drink with your lunch four hours later... an d then think about it again when you pour the la st still very warm cup of coffee at the end of the day. The same laws of physics apply to an y vehicle travelin g through space. NASA claims that the spacecraft was slowly ro tated causing the shadowed side to be cooled by the intense cold of space... an intense cold that DOES NOT EXIST. In fact the only thing that could have been accomplished by a rotation of the spacecraft is a more even and constant he ating such as that ob tained by rotating a hot dog on a spit. In real ity a dish called Astronaut a la Apollo would have been served. At the very least you wo uld not want to open the hatch upon the crafts return. NASA knows better than to claim, in additio n, that a water cooling apparatus such as that which they claim cooled the astronauts suits cool ed the spacecraft. No rocket could ever have been laun ched with the amount of water needed to work such a system for ev en a very short period of time. Fresh water weighs a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"little over 62 lbs. per cubic foot. Space and weight capaci ty were critical given the lift capability of the rockets used in the Apollo Space Program. No such extra water was carried by any mission wh atsoever for suits or for cooling the spacecraft. On the tapes the Astronauts complained b itterly of the cold during their journey and while on the surface of the moon. They spoke of using heaters that did not give off enough heat to overcome the inte nse cold of space. It was imperative that NASA use this ruse because to tell the truth would TELL THE TRUTH. It is also proof of the arrogance and contempt in which the Illuminati holds the common man. What we heard is in reality indicative of an over zealous cooling system in the props used during the filming of the missions at the Atomic Energy Commissions Nevada desert test site, whe re it is common to see temperatures well over 100 degrees. In the glaring un filtered direct heat of the sun the Astronauts could never have been cold at any time whatsoev er in the perfect insulating vacu um of space. NASA claims that the space suits worn by the astronauts were pressurized at 5 psi over the ambient pressure (0 psi vacuum) on the moon's surface. We have examined the gloves NASA claims the as tronauts wore and find they are made of pliable material contai ning no mechanical, hydrauli c, or electrical devices which would aid the astronauts in the dext erous use of their fingers and hands while wearing the gloves. Experiments pr ove absolutely that such gloves are impossible to use and that the wearer cannot bend the wrist or fingers to do any dexterous work whatsoever when filled with 5 psi over ambient pressure either in a vacuum or in the earth's atmosp here. NASA actually showed film and television footage of astronauts usin g their hands and fingers normally during their EVAs on the so-called lunar surf ace. The films show clearly that there is no pressure whatsoever within the gloves ... a condition that would have caused explosive decompression of the astronauts resulting in almost immediate death if they had really been surro unded by the vacuum of space. If you don't be lieve it try it yourself... it is a very si mple experiment and does not require a rocket scientist to perform. These are just two of over a hundred very simple and very easy to prove va lid scientific reasons why NASA and the Apollo Space Program are tw o of the biggest lies ever foisted upon the unsuspecting and trusting People of the world. In addition most, if not all, of the ph otos, films, and videotape of the Apollo Moon Missions are easily proven to be fake. Anyone w ith the slightest"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"knowledge of photography, lighting, and physics ca n easily prove that NASA faked the visual records of the Apollo Space Program. Some are so obviously fake that when the discrepancies are po inted out to unsusp ecting viewers an audible gasp has been heard. Some ha ve actually gone in to a mild state of shock. Some People break down and cry. I have seen others become so angry that they have ripped the offending photos to shreds while screaming incoherently. C. Fred Kleinknect, head of NASA at the time of the Apollo Space Program, is now the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Council of the 33rd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry of the Southern Jurisdiction. It was his reward for pulling it off. All of the first astronauts were Freemasons. There is a photograph in the House of the Temple in Washington DC of Neil Armstrong on the moons su rface (supposedly) in his spacesuit holding his Masonic Apron in front of his groin. The effect upon the people of the world was, that if we could go to the moon other creatures from other worlds could tr avel to our Earth. The escalation of the artificial alien threat scenario since that time is obvious. The recent revelations of the fraudulent nature of NASA and the Apollo space program by the Intelligence Service a nd others has resulted in a flood of propaganda, television programs, and films designed to keep the sheople trapped in a deep ignorant sleep. Th e most ambitious are \"Apollo 13\" and \"From the Earth to the Moon\", both invo lving the actor/producer Tom Hanks. The latter opens with a monologue by Mr. Hanks who walks forward revealing a huge representation of the \"God\" Apollo (Sun, Osiris, lost word, etc.) guiding his chariot pulled by 4 hor ses through the heavens. End Excerpt from William Cooper's Recent Conspiracy Overview [Watcher Website wants you folks to keep in mind that Apollo is \"Lucifer\", and has also been linked to the planet Mars . Other significant links, remember, are that the international flag of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is the United Nations Flag (according to the ir own site, as Bill Cooper points out), and that the United Nations Flag depicts the nation s of the world encircled by the laurel of Apollo!
