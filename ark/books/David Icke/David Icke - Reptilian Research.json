[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Reptilian Research Archives hosted by David Icke THE CULT OF THE SERPENT THE CULT OF THE SERPENTTHE CULT OF THE SERPENT THE CULT OF THE SERPENT What do the following names all have in common: Dennis Brunnell, Stan Deyo, William Cooper, Bill Hamilton, Val Valerian, 'Commander X' and Robert Lazar? They all allege that the following scenario is a reality... Ever since the so-called \"end\" of the NASA moon shots the U.S. \"secret\" government has been involved in covert manned space exploration of this solar system utilizing super-advanced technologies which are so revolutionary that the secret government has chosen to tell the public little or nothing about it. Some of these sources even claim that an inner core of this \"secret government\" have in the past worked hand-in-claw with a race of hominoid-sauroid reptilian beings who have given these humans \"elite\" technology and power (over their fellow man) in exchange for certain powers and influences which this secret government or \"serpent cult\" gave these reptilian beings over the masses of humanity. There are allegedly other human groups, native to earth and much more ancient, who left this planet in ancient times after obtaining similar technologies. Some of these ancient and modern groups \"sold out\" to this reptilian race in exchange for technology, while others developed such technologies of their own initiative (as in the case of many of the human \"reptilian\" races who are often referred to as the \"Nordics\"). SECRET AGENDAS As for the covert space operations that are being carried out by various top-secret organizations within the U.S. government, they are based on a combination of \"reptilian\" technology recovered from numerous crash-retrievals of aerial disks, while other aspects are based on prototype and state-of-the-art Military-Industrial technologies developed by well-known U.S. companies. These advanced technologies include anti-gravity generators and electromagnetic propulsion systems and massive top-secret space efforts which have largely been financed through deception and through hundreds of billions of dollars which have generously (although unknowingly) been provided via 'Black' budgets by hard-working American taxpayers. Dennis Brunnell, a 33rd degree Mason and a Grandmaster in the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) had become \"dis-illusioned\" by the Illuminati's present activities. Originally believing that the Illuminati was a mystic lodge designed to illuminate one into mystical heights of ascended awareness, he eventually learned that such metaphysical talk was just so much hot air designed to gain the willing assistance of lower-ranking \"lodge\" members, who were unknowingly being manipulated into serving the hypocritical, self- seeking and self-serving imperialistic goals of a relatively small inner core of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"illumined\" members. Some years ago a man by the name of John Todd, a member of a family who were high-level and generational members of a druidic witchcraft cult, alleged that through his occult contacts he was chosen to be initiated into a deep-level Illuminati lodge. He claimed that in doing so he had to \"unlearn\" much of the wiccan philosophies which he was taught at a young age. These occult teachings were merely a means, he soon found out, of this inner core of initiates to control the lower ranks of the lodge. This inner core, which consisted of 13 individuals, were (he claims) THE LEADERS of all the large wiccan/witchcraft organizations AS WELL AS the leaders of World Freemasonry. These men controlled BOTH movements from their lofty positions, along with much of the world's drug trafficking, and had powerful influence in world economic and political movements. Mr. Todd soon learned that this inner core were continually fearful that the lower-ranking members of the occult societies would turn against \"them\" if the lower members ever found out that this inner council were merely using these \"lower pawns\" to increase their own wealth and their god-like power and authority over the rest of humanity. The Rothschilds of London, he also learned, were at the very heart of this conspiracy, along with the Jesuits in Rome. The Rothschilds were considered to be \"human gods\" by many occultists and, according to Mr. Todd, were in constant communication with \"Lucifer\", who they themselves considered to be god. There are also indications, as we will give later in these texts, that they were/are also in contact with the serpent race as well, which would make them an integral part of the \"serpent cult\". Dennis Brunnell, John Todd and in fact millions of former Communists, realized that there was an incredible contradiction between what these world socialists were telling their \"followers\" and what these inner elite were actually practicing. The connection we make between Illuminism and Communism (which is still very strong in mainland China) is no coincidence, as both are socialist movements. Also, according to well- known geo-political analysts such as Dr. John Coleman, Karl Marx himself had known ties with 33rd degree Masonry and the Jesuit Order. As for John Todd, he later \"defected\" from this secret lodge after he \"suggested\" to the other members that in light of recent events the prophecies of the Bible should be studied. Their answer to this, he claims, was a murderous stare from most if not all of the other members of this council of 13. He believes he was lucky he got out of there alive. These men, apparently, did not even want to consider the possibility that the Holy Bible could be true, for they knew well enough that it was against every imperialistic and deceitful practice that they were involved in. John Todd later became a Christian and spoke to various audiences around the country until, according to some sources, he was later assassinated. Brunnell alleged that some within the Illuminati were so heartless as to believe that their socialist \"World Order\" must be brought about even if the orchestrating of wars, etc., had to be accomplished in order to create the conditions necessary for establishing it... or, in other words, that the end justified the means. These lost souls were and are apparently convinced that they have the divine right to decide the fate of nations, and that the masses of humanity exist for no other reason than to serve their cause. They consider themselves \"gods\" and the rest of humanity as \"mere mortals\". So much for the end-result of the false promise that was given to man by the serpent race as revealed in Genesis chapter 3, which was that men could be as gods, and that the creature could be independent from or equal to the Creator. The serpent race knew full well that the dis-connection of man from their trust and reliance in the Godhead would result in lost power and dominion over the earth and the beasts, including the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"serpent race, and as a result the reptilians could take control of that which mankind forfeited, including man himself! Since that ancient time the saurians have been able to find those among humanity who would be willing to believe their false promises in exchange for temporary physical gains. SKULL AND BONES One of Dennis Brunnell's \"Gemstone\" research papers (which also described the Mafia-CIA-oil company connection to the John F. Kennedy assassination, confirming the original \"Gemstone\" reports of Bruce Roberts) included a scenario developed by Kissinger and other Illuminists in the early 1980's or before. This scenario showed one such proposed plan as to how war could be used to bring the United States - the last obstacle standing in the way of absolute Illuminati rule of the world - into subjection to the one-world Socialist state. This scenario, possibly one of many developed, was in the form of a speech given by a U.S. president. George Bush was sited as a very possible candidate to this \"speech\" (This was years before Bush became vice president, which suggests that Brunnell was in fact tapped-into some very sensitive information). It was basically written as a possible emergency address to the nation which would supposedly take place after years of American involvement in an - Illuminati orchestrated? - war in the Middle East. The scenario continued as \"the President\" informs the nation that, due to the long drawn-out (Korea/Vietnam like no- win) war which has depleted our national resources, a certain Executive Order was to be issued for the \"good\" of the nation which would result in practically ALL PRIVATE AGENCIES coming under the absolute control of the Federal Government. In short, according to this scenario, if such a plan was carried out then the entire nation could be brought under absolute socialist control in one night. Such a scenario may not be too far-fetched when we realize the following: 1) George Bush was, during his years at Yale University, initiated into the \"Skull & Bones\" society, also known as the \"Brotherhood of Death\". According to prominent political and financial analysts such as Antony Sutten, there is much documentation to suggest that Skull & Bones is nothing less than a Western branch of the Bavarian Illuminati, designed to recruit highly-educated individuals into serving it's cause; 2) George Bush served as THE DIRECTOR of the CIA for several years, which, according to various sources, is actually serving the one- world movement; 3) Bush has very close ties with one-world organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations or C.F.R., Federal Reserve, Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergers, Alpine Institute, etc.; 4) Before Ronald Reagan \"chose\" a running mate, according to the late Gary Allen, he was approached at a political convention by the duo of Walter Cronkite and Henry Kissinger, both alleged Illuminists, and \"strongly encouraged\" to choose George Bush as his running mate as Bush was well-favored by the International Banking Establishment of Wallstreet; 5) The Bush family is very rich and are heavily involved in high-profit, offshore oil drilling companies. 6) Also, when news of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait - where the Bush family's oil business had some vested interests - reached America, George Bush was at the one-"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"world \"Aspen\" Institute of Colorado visiting with Margaret Thatcher. Bush's decision to rally the nations together by sending our young men and women to fight and die for the \"New World Order\", was based on \"advice\" he received from officials at the one-world Aspen Institute. Although \"Operation Desert Storm\" was a well-planned and well master-minded attack, the fact nevertheless remains that we were fighting to defend the \"New World Order\" and the oil interests (whereas we only get a very small percentage of our oil from Kuwait) and not to defend the constitutional United States. This war was a two-sided event. Even though the motive may have been other than in harmony with America's best interests in that (like Korea and Vietnam) it was fought FOR the Socialist-oriented United Nations; some good nevertheless came out of it, in essence, that America was able to defend ISRAEL from an aggressive enemy, something which Almighty God most likely honored. However the target, Saddam Hussain, escaped free while tens of thousands of his subjects, so many pawns in a huge game of chess, had to pay the price with their lives. As the Word of God says, \"evil shall slay the wicked\" (Psalm 34:21). This may in part apply to Iraq, the land of ancient Babylon (the ancient city where the one-world movement and all occult movements had their genesis) which in a strange twist of fate was \"judged\" by the very oppressive movement which it created. Notice also Bush's constant references to the \"New World Order\" - a concept which is a mockery of the Declaration of INDEPENDENCE which our forefathers shed their blood to defend. True, we must as a nation not ignore the rest of the world, yet at the same time we should not surrender ourselves to the rest of the world either, but preserve the American Republic as a bastion of Freedom to which the oppressed of ALL NATIONS can take refuge. The reason we are so critical of this particular presidency is because we believe that the secret government - utilizing it's influence in mass-media control, MANIPULATED Bush into office in a direct perversion of the electorial process. In other words, through the fantastic media power which they wielded, the one-worlders snuffed out the competition. We realize that it is Biblical to honor the governing officials, yet this is only to the EXTENT that the governing powers submit to the Almighty governing power of the Universe, God Himself. Elijah criticized the ancient King Ahab for this very reason, because he was leading the nation of Israel astray into Baal worship. Unfortunately, King Ahab and George Bush may have had a lot in common. We would rather hope that the opposite were true, but facts are facts. However, we must not fall into the trap of pointing the finger at any one person, as Bush happens to be only one link in a very large and very powerful \"secret government\" chain which, as we have seen, has sold out much of this planet to \"The Beast\". Bush, like many misled \"insiders\", was no doubt largely a product of his environment, as well as a member of a generational \"Establishment\" family, and more-or-less a puppet or voicebox of secret government policy. This fact should be taken into account, as well as the fact that the major \"enemy\" is the draconian influence as it exists in and behind the secret government establishment. There were, nevertheless, less-than-honorable motives on the part of the United States in it's decision to fight in the Gulf War (see: YOUTH ACTION NEWS - Oct. 1990., Box 312., Alexandria, VA 22313 - this source gives much evidence that Bush and Company more-or-less \"encouraged\" the Kuwaiti invasion and, when faced with irrefutable proof that such an invasion was coming, did absolutely nothing to warn the Kuwaitis or the Iraqis against such an invasion. Was Bush and Company willing to risk the lives of thousands of people just so his One World Government could be established and a \"trial run\" of the global U.N. Police Force could be initiated?). "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"According to Dr. John Coleman (World Intelligence Review., Box 426., Metairie, LA 70004), the ancient Babylonian Serpent Cult, or what is known today as the \"Illuminati\" (33rd degree Freemasonry) is under the direct control of some very nefarious forces. Coleman in fact provides much evidence that 33rd degree Masonry has been used not only to infiltrate and take over many political, economic and religious institutions, but has also been used to \"create\" such institutions as well, organizations to which people will flock and submit their power and energies to unknowingly serve an agenda that they know nothing about. This was and is carried out through the 22 \"Palladium\" Lodges which, according to various sources, can be traced back to the Grand Masonic Lodge in England. According to Coleman and many others, the Grandmasters of Masonry AND of Jesuitism (ie. the Illuminati) are working together in this conspiracy. In many cases the individuals involved are both Jesuits AND Masonic initiates. Such was the case of Guisseppi Mazzini, who was a Jesuit-Mason, and a satanist-witch to boot, and was second-in-command to the Masonic \"Pontiff\" Albert Pike - whose rotting remains now lie beneath the \"House of the Temple\" in Washington D.C. (see Dr. Coleman's tapes: CONSPIRACY CULTS AND THE ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT, and FREEMASONRY AND THE ONE WORLD CONSPIRACY). Other works that may be very revealing along this line, as we indicated earlier, are the writings of former 33rd degree Mason and former Past Master of all Scottish-Rite Masonic bodies, the Rev. Jim Shaw. This is especially true with his book THE DEADLY DECEPTION (P.O. Box 884., Silver Springs, FL 32688). In this work Mr. Shaw exposes the blatant SERPENT worship secretly taking place within the Masonic HOUSE OF THE TEMPLE in Washington D.C. Mix this with the accounts of \"Masonic\" street-outlays built into Washington D.C. itself and accounts of tunnels beneath the city which connect many of the important Federal buildings and which allegedly extend to extreme depths and distances, then you have a recipe for something very strange and sinister which is undermining our nations capitol. No wonder the Christian-Patriots within the American Republic have had to fight \"the enemy within\" for so long with so little apparent results from their efforts. Concerning Bush's one-world policies, we will quote here from a few letters to the editor which appeared in various issues of the UTAH COUNTY JOURNAL, as confirmation of some of the statements which we have previously made. One letter, appearing in the April 30, 1991 issue of the U.C.J., stated: \"Editor: The April-May '91 issue of COMMON CAUSE reports that the first successful exploration for oil in Kuwait was done by the Zapata Oil Co., of which current President George Bush was a founder and director. The President's son, George W. Bush, is now the third largest insider stockholder in another off-shore oil drilling company located in Bahrain, 15 miles from Saudi Arabia. This is Harken Energy Corp., with its home base in Bedford, Texas. \"Does this information explain the Rambo-like \"hurry up\" war in Kuwait? Does it explain marked shifts in acceptance or castigation of Saddam Hussein? Does it offer an explanation for the terrible destruction of the Kuwait oil fields and Persian Gulf waters? Do these two leaders really have the welfare of their respective peoples at heart? I would give anything to read one of the history books on this war written 25-50 years hence. - Eugene J. Faux; Provo.\" And in the Feb. 26, 1991 issue of the same publication: \"Editor: In the Feb. 12 issue of the JOURNAL an obviously well-intentioned lady suggested that we pray for President Bush because he has 'awesome responsibilities.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" \"He has, indeed, many awesome responsibilities: a responsibility to uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution; a responsibility to weed out those in our government who, by intent or neglect, work to undermine the Republican form of government given to us by our founding fathers; a responsibility to tell the American people the TRUTH about the incredible, rapidly escalating national debt and what the debt will mean to our children and our children's children 'unto the seventh generation' and beyond. He also has a responsibility to expose the hypocrisy of those who are working diligently to bring about a new constitutional convention, supposedly to propose one or two new amendments, while they already have entire new constitutions written and waiting. - Albert V. Burns; Spanish Fork.\" Another letter which appeared in the UTAH COUNTY JOURNAL during the Bush-Iraq controversy, Mar. 5 1991 issue, stated: \"Editor: Mrs. (Colleen D.) brought up a very good point about my criticism of George Bush and his New World Order agenda. Rightfully, as a leader of a nation, he might be considered exempt from censure for any mistakes that he might make through oversight or a lack of proper information. Unfortunately, this is far from the case with Bush. \"Sadly, the president is very cognizant of his actions and exactly where these actions are speedily leading us - to a world government ruled by elitist insiders. History can conclude nothing less than this result. For a complete analysis of Bush, his political history, and his leadership of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, I enthusiastically recommend the new book on George Bush - THE ESTABLISHMENT MAN, available through The John Birch Society. Well documented, this book will put to rest any remaining praises for our chief executive. \"In fact, my critique of the executive is founded upon my patriotism, not turning against it. President Teddy Roosevelt stated: \"Patriotism means to stand by the country. IT DOES NOT MEAN TO STAND BY THE PRESIDENT OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL SAVE EXACTLY TO THE DEGREE IN WHICH HE HIMSELF STANDS BY THE COUNTRY. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country.\" As Bush has repeatedly violated his oath to defend the Constitution, I will continue to patriotically reproach his intentions. \"As for being in the White House when Bush sent National Security Adviser Brant Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to Beijing immediately and secretly after the Tienamen Square massacre, no, I was not present when he made that call. That's why we have the press. The White House announced that such was the case on Dec. 18, 1989, to anyone listening. Such betrayal of freedom-fighters is par for the course when we look at Bush's policy toward other people seeking liberty, but receiving only his true objective: World despotism in his New World Order. - Bruce J. Martin.\" In relation to the above concern of whether we should unquestioningly trust our elected (?) heads of state, it is interesting that of all the presidents which have been in the White House since the assassination of John F. Kennedy (which many allege was"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"actually an Illuminati-inspired coup), EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM have been supportive of the one-world government movement as it is incarnate in the Council of Foreign relations and allied global organizations. Coincidence? Finally, we have this letter from the September 18, 1990 issue of the same publication: \"Editor: In his September address to the nation, President Bush stated his five objectives for the massive deployment of U.S. troops. The fifth is the fundamental reason for this operation. As Mr. Bush stated himself, \"The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward a historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective - a new world order - can emerge... We are now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders.\" \"The U.N. 'founders' included U.S. communist traitor, Alger Hiss, who was the acting secretary general of the conference in San Francisco in 1945. Hiss was accompanied by a contingent of U.S. communists and a swarm of Council on Foreign Relations members. The communists wanted world government by revolution and the others wanted it by way of socialism. In either case, these individuals did not want national sovereignty of the kind fought for by our founding fathers. \"The fundamental difference between a \"new world order\" under the United Nations and an independent United States are nowhere more clearly indicated than in our DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE affirmation that \"men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.\" The UN's total exclusion of God means that rights do not come from God, (but) that they proceed from government, and government can and will take them away. \"Our country has suffered in the past from U.N. decisions and action. U.N. advocates gave away all the gains our fighting men bled and died for in Europe and Asia after World War II. We fought Korea and Vietnam under U.N. sanction and command with victory denied even though over 100,000 men lost their lives and hundreds of thousands were wounded (in addition to this, several sources allege that communist nationals working within the U.N. constantly betrayed U.S. positions and strategies to their allies in North Korea, and repeated this betrayal during the Vietnam conflict as well. It is a fact that the MAJORITY of the \"United\" Nations Secretary Generals have also been communist nationals - Branton). Nixon and Kissinger operating under \"new world order\" dictates gave South Vietnam to the communist enemy after our military fought so valiantly even with the treasonous restrictions imposed on them. \"Now, George Bush wants the men and women of our armed forces to die... for the new world order... George Bush's drive for a \"new world order\" is not worth ONE DROP of American blood. But blood we shall have until we once again elect constitutionalists to office instead of one-worlders. - Mike Thomas; Pleasant Grove.\" The January 26, 1990 issue of THE NEW FEDERALIST revealed even more about the Bush - one world connection. In his article, BUSH'S CHINA POLICY: SKULL AND BONES, Joseph Brewda writes: \"Jan 19 (EIRNS)--An obscure secret society known as \"Skull and Bones\" may have more to do with George Bush's obsessive support of Beijing's mass murderers than one may think. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Skull and Bones is a secret fraternity at Yale University which is restricted to a mere fifteen student members per year. The society was formed in 1832 by General William Russell, whose shipping firm later dominated the U.S. side of the China opium trade. Yale University was founded by Eli Yale, who made his fortune working for the opium smuggling British East India Company. \"Skull and Bones became the recruiting grounds and preserve of the most important New England-centered families--families who also made their money in the opium trade. These families, whose sons regularly join Skull and Bones, include the little known, but powerful, Coffins, Sloanes, Tafts, Bundys, Paynes, Whitneys. They are a dominant element of the U.S. 'Eastern Establishment' to this day. The Bush family is one of a cluster of lower-level Establishment families controlled by these interests. \"What has this to do with Bush policy towards China--or for that matter, Bush's \"War on Drugs\"? (Note: the last television news reporter to ask Bush a critical question concerning the many narcotics agents who are complaining about how bad the \"drug war\" was going, was promptly fired from his job shortly after the press conference - Branton) \"George Bush, the first U.S. diplomatic representative to the People's Republic of China back in 1973, was a member of Skull and Bones. So were his father, brother, son, uncle, nephew, and several cousins. Winston Lord, the Reagan-Bush administration Ambassador to China was a member; so were his father and several other relatives. James Lilley, the current Ambassador to China, was a member of Skull and Bones, as was his brother. Except during the Carter administration, every U.S. Ambassador to Beijing since Kissinger's deal with Mao Zedong was a member of the same tiny Yale cult. A mere coincidence? \"MAO WAS A YALIE - Back in 1903, Yale Divinity School established a number of schools and hospitals throughout China that were collectively known as 'Yale in China.' It has since been shown that 'Yale in China' was an intelligence network whose purpose was to destroy the republican movement of Sun Yat-sen on behalf of the Anglo-American Establishment. The Anglo-American \"Establishment\" hated Sun, because he wanted to develop China. On the other hand, they loved the Chinese communists because they intended to keep China backward, and were committed to growing dope. One of 'Yale in China's' most important students was Mao Zedong. \"During World War II, 'Yale in China' was a primary instrument used by the U.S. Establishment and its Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to install the Maoists into power. 'Yale in China' was run by OSS operative Reuben Holden, the husband of Bush's cousin, and also a member of Skull and Bones. \"The Maoists made China into the world's largest opium producer. \"'Yale in China' was also closely associated with the New York-based Union Theological Seminary, which has been a center for U.S. subversion of Asia (literal wolves in sheeps clothing - Branton). Every prominent radical leader operating in Korea today, for example, was trained at Union Theological. Union Theological was dominated for twenty years by Henry Sloane Coffin, a U.S. intelligence executive from the Sloane and Coffin families. He was a Skull and Bones member as were a dozen of his relatives. \"Nor should it be forgotten that Averell Harriman, the former Ambassador to Moscow"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"who did so much to build up the Soviet Union, was a member of Skull and Bones. Harriman was also a business partner of Prescott Bush, Sr., the father of Maoist enthusiast George Bush.\" Note: This Skull and Bones - Communist connection is also confirmed by geopolitical and economics researchers such as Dr. Antony Sutton (Sutton's books may be obtained through THE PATRIOT REVIEW., 33836 SE Kelso Rd. #6., P.O. Box 596., Boring, OR 97099; OR via THE MIDNIGHT MESSENGER., P.O. Box 472., Altadens, CA 91001). Not only did the Skull and Bones (Western Illuminati) help to build up the Communist movement in China, but they gave considerable financial aid to the Soviet Union communists as well. According to Sutton, this power cult has for centuries been playing a \"two ends against the middle\" type of game, attempting to control America (the thesis) and Russia (the anti-thesis) and other countries or movements, carefully pitting them against each other at the lower levels in order to keep the populations of the world in a state of confusion and despair, to the point that they will - hopefully - resign themselves into accepting the New World Order \"synthesis\" as the only alternative to solve the very \"problems\" which THEY, the New World Order initiators, created in the first place! One startling, though documented, claim which Mr. Sutton makes is that the Nazi Movement was largely financed by the Skull and Bones - Illuminati as well. This connection was recently described in a mailer describing Val Valerian's book MATRIX III (c/o Leading Edge Research., P.O. Box 481-MU58., Yelm, WASH 98597). Part of this mailer states: \"Interspaced with the material comes a host of data, supplementary material, interviews, and revealing information. The 'Final Scenario' is discussed relative to the New World Order and the plans for total economic control, a one-world religion, and the electronic mind control objectives, schools of thought, and research. MATRIX III brings out in detail how various families in the United States and Europe are also involved in a scenario which has as its main tenet the suppression and elimination of human beings on many levels - a scenario which includes worldwide traffic of drugs, vast laundering of drug money by national banks of several countries, and assassination and murder. These are the people who arranged and supported all the wars. There is discussion of the Bush family, and how Prescott Bush assisted the finance and management of the Nazi empire - the so-called Hitler project...\" Much of Valerian's writings are very well-documented and can be followed-up, yet the only criticism of his work which we have deals with the fact that, we believe, he has placed too much confidence in so-called \"channeled\" revelations as sources of information. We believe, based on past experience and research, that much of the information received through so-called \"trance channels\" should be discarded for several reasons: 1) Such information is often self-contradictory. 2) Channeled revelations often contradict \"revelations\" received through other \"channels\". 3) There are supernatural beings inhabiting the aerial realm whose very purpose and \"assignment\" is to counterfeit \"divine\" revelation in order to spread propaganda, confusion or mislead the seeker from the truth. This is often, we have found, accomplished by offering the seeker a substantial amount of \"truth\" in order to uphold"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"one strategic lie. 4) Channeled information in most cases cannot be followed up by physical documentation or evidence. 5) There are many indications that non-human beings, both supernatural and reptilian, are utilizing occult channels in order to carry out propaganda warfare against those who possess the truth. As we will see in later writings there is also much evidence that these reptilian beings have utilized witchcraft and occult movements (ie. the serpent cults) since the earliest times in order to further their reptilian cause. In relation to the Bush - Establishment - Serpent Cult - Reptilian connection, we will now quote from an article which was submitted by one of our researchers. This article, written by a Gerard Van der Leun, appeared in the Nov. 1990 issue of Penthouse Magazine: \"IS GEORGE BUSH AT THE CENTER OF THE GREATEST AND MOST SECRET PLOT EVER LAUNCHED AGAINST MANKIND? \"Dear Reader: It is a well-known fact that: \"1) The government has approved and entered into a secret treaty with an reptilian nation. \"2) The government, with this treaty, has traded human lives and property (in the form of livestock and land) for reptilian technology. \"3) The government has murdered, incarcerated, forcibly relocated, brainwashed, coerced, drugged, harassed, and otherwise interfered unlawfully in the lives of patriots, including a president of the United States, who have attempted to expose this murder and treason. \"4) In pursuit of bringing all those responsible for these acts to justice, the following are hereby charged with conspiracy, murder, and treason: the Trilateral Commission; the President; the Vice-President; the director of Central Intelligence; certain other members of the CIA; the director of the National Security Agency; members of the Cabinet; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the director of the Senior Interagency Group (SIG); the national security adviser to the President; and the Navy Department which has field operation control of all reptilian-connected projects. It is expected that many others who have taken part in the joint government and reptilian conspiracy will also be charged with conspiracy, murder, and treason. This list will include all those who served in the aforementioned positions from 1953 up to and including the present administration. (Note: Since many of these individuals are merely \"following the orders\" of the elite insider groups who are ultimately controlled by the Jesuit-Masons; the GRANDMASTERS of Jesuit-Masonry, the inner Illuminati or Serpent Cult, should be indicted as the major traitors against the human race. Many of these Jesuit-Mason leaders are members of the ancient generational families who have controlled the drug trade, manipulated wars and revolutions in their favor, and have infiltrated the economic institutions of the world. They have no fear of divine retribution because they believe in no god other than themselves - Branton) \"5.) We call for the impeachment of the president of the United States, George Bush. As president and C.E.O. of Zapata Oil, Mr. Bush organized and has headed the narcotics-smuggling conspiracy since its beginning. The off-shore oil platforms of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Zapata Oil were used as staging areas from which drugs were moved into these United States without passing through Customs or undergoing inspection of any kind. We firmly believe that George Bush now heads this shadow government that controls the reptilian technology, the military-industrial complex, and thus the nation. The fact that he is now the president of these United States of America makes George Bush the most powerful and dangerous criminal in the history of the world.\" Note: Where does all this ill-gained money go? According to many sources, much of this as well as the multi-billions in \"Black Budget\" monies provided by the taxpayers pours into the insiders' relentless and secret efforts to construct underground as well as off-planet (Moon, Mars, etc.) places of refuge where the secret government members and their families will escape to in the event of a global manmade or natural catastrophe. How thoughtful of us \"mere mortals\" to give our wealth and even our very lives just so that the \"immortal elite\" can survive to usher in a \"New Age\" on planet earth... This reminds us of something the 33rd degree Mason/O.T.O. Grandmaster Dennis Brunnell said: That the creator of the James Bond movie \"Moonraker\" had inside knowledge of the secret government's end-time plan, and thought that it would make a great movie. But as they say, Truth is even stranger than fiction. UNDERGROUND DWELLERS The modern secret societies which are being manipulated by the infernal reptilian races are apparently extensions of more ancient societies who were also manipulated and influenced by these subterranean creatures. Several ancient races in fact believed in the existence of an \"underworld\" inhabited by serpent-like beings possessed with supernatural powers. Many of these mis-guided souls even worshipped these creatures, not so much out of adoration, but more out of fear or terror. Human sacrifices were even offered in an attempt to appease the destructive influence of these \"demon gods\", and temples and shrines were often built over or near caverns which were regarded by these superstitious people to be openings to this nether world. One such shrine is located several miles southeast of Oaxaco, Mexico among some very ancient ruins. Among these ruins lies the ancient temple of \"Mitla\". Various accounts allege that in ancient times this temple descended deep underground into a basement, a sub-basement, and an ultra-sub-basement level. Within this third sub- level a large stone door was said to have concealed subterranean recesses beyond. According to the late subsurface researcher Charles A. Marcoux, as well as the anonymous U.S. Intelligence worker \"Commander X\", and others, the native Indians of the area centuries ago used to sacrifice humans to the underworld \"gods\" that were believed to exist within the dark caverns beyond the stone door. These victims were allegedly thrown into these dark chambers alive and were never seen again. Some centuries ago some priests arrived in this area of southeastern Mexico and commenced to explore the ruins, including the ancient Temple of Mitla. They managed to pry open the door in the third basement level and entered the underground chambers beyond. Torches in hand, they continued deep into what seemed to be an endless subterranean concourse leading in the direction of a distant mountain range. After penetrating a considerable distance they became fearful as they noticed serpents slithering among the rocks off in the darkness, they would see strange shapes and shadows among the ancient stone pillars which lined the concourse, eerie noises and winds began to blow through the large passage, and a they were overcome with a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"general feeling of fear and dread. Convinced that they were on the outskirts of Hades itself they made a hasty retreat, after which the Priests sealed the door and ordered the natives to fill-in all three basement levels with rock and earth, completely concealing all evidence of the subterranean connection. Another such account involves the ancient Greek \"Temple of Apollo\", in Hierapolis (now Pamukkale), Turkey. This city was once part of the ancient Grecian empire, which covered an extensive area in and around the Mediterranean sea. One article which appeared in the January, 1989 issue of OMNI Magazine, referred to strange disappearances which had taken place in a cavern adjacent to this now broken-down temple. The article quoted from the writings of the ancient Greek philosopher \"Strabe\" (who lived between 63 B.C. and 24 A.D.), to the effect that animals would often enter the cave and never return. Also MANY PEOPLE throughout history who went past the mouth of the cave never returned. The article also quoted one Sheldon Aaronson, a professor of microbiology at Queens College, N.Y., who told OMNI that several Australian students had entered the cave and disappeared just a few days before his visit in 1987. Sheldon stated: \"The Turkish government put iron bars over the opening to prevent other people from ever going in. As far as we knew, the Australians were never seen again.\" According to the article, the Greeks believed that the cavern was an opening into the \"land of the dead ruled by the gods of the underworld.\" As for the possibility of an underground subterranean \"world\", science tells us that the lowest depths of the earth (upper and lower mantles) contain temperature and pressure extremes so great that physical life could not possibly exist there. Some however believe that there is evidence for the existence of a vast global network of geothermal and hydrothermal cavities, somehow connected to the ancient deluge wherein the \"...fountains of the great deep were broken up\". This allegedly occurred as magma-heated stratas of subterranean water-filled caverns (brought to enormous pressures by an expanding and over-heated mantle) suddenly burst through the crust (Gen. 7:11) like a tremendously large exploding pressure boiler. Some claim that the underlying basaltic rock layers within these gigantic global aqua-systems were dissolved into these global subterranean reservoirs as their temperatures and pressures increased. Afterwards these vast amounts of water exploded to the surface, thus explaining why the oceans now contain large percentages of \"salt\". These underlying chambers, many of which collapsed yet many of which remained intact, are believed to exist throughout the moho and crustal regions of the planet, just above the upper mantle. If evidence of ancient sunken continents ever becomes irrefutable, then such a theory would explain why whole island-continents may have collapsed. Such a cataclysm may have resulted from the possible fact that huge underground chambers, no longer supported by these subterranean waters, suddenly caved-in on themselves. Other higher-level cavities created through seismic activity may also exist, cavities which may dwarf the Flint Ridge-Mammoth Caves of Kentucky or New Mexico's Carlsbad- Lechuguilla cavern system. It is suggested that THESE may contain conditions sufficient to support physical life (ie. air, water, subterranean flora and fauna, and perhaps even electromagnetically-induced illumination diffused throughout the underground \"atmosphere\" through a phenomena somewhat similar to the effect produced by the Aurora Borealis or \"Northern Lights\"). As we've said, there are literally hundreds of accounts which seem to support each other (we will attempt to describe as many of these as we can in future documents), suggesting that the above scenario or theory of a subterranean realm is a correct one."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"These accounts also suggest that antediluvian \"Adamic\" races, sometime before their destruction, possessed the ability to construct and excavate vast systems of underground tunnels connecting many of these natural cavities. Scientific discoveries including \"ooparts\" (out-of-place-artifacts) also prove that the pre or ante-diluvians were much more intelligence and scientifically-advanced than most think, although of course many accounts state that this intelligence became corrupted, leading in part to their own destruction. Theologically speaking, the Bible indicates that the Adamic races achieved complex forms of scientific invention only a relatively few generations after man was established on this planet. For instance, Genesis 4:22 indicates that by the time of Tubal-cain, 7th generation AFTER Adam, complex iron and metalwork, including no doubt increasingly complex forms of weaponry, were being produced. When we take into account the long life-span of these ancients, which was on the average of 500 years or more (Gen. chapt. 5) and the time-span between Adam and Noah, and compare this with the fact that modern man himself has gone from the horse-and-buggy to interplanetary travel in LESS THAN 100 years, then such a possibility seems even more apparent. Also, Adam was no doubt formed by the Creator as a perfect \"prototype\" human being. Of course he would have to be very intelligence in order to carry out the purposes which the Creator charged to him - ie. to name and identify all of the animals and trees, subdue the planet and become it's guardian, care for his wife and so on. As we've indicated, after mankind's fateful encounter with the serpent race and our progenitor's unfortunate response to the subversive strategies of the Reptilians, man lost much of the original supernatural dominion which he possessed over the earth and over the (by that time self-corrupted) serpent race. The war between the humans and the saurians had begun, and according to many sources (many of which, as we've said, we will describe later on) man was forced to defend himself from these reptilian predators. Some sources believe that this was one of the major reasons why the Adamic race initially began, when the technology was developed to do so, to build the ancient subterranean systems. In these they would apparently be safe from the saurian predators as well as from other human races with whom they might have been in conflict. The serpent race won this battle however in that they were able, through manipulation, to turn these antediluvian human races against themselves to the point of almost complete destruction. At this point we will quote from one of the many sources describing encounters with what may very well be a remnant of this antediluvian \"tunnel\" network. The following account was given in a letter which was submitted to AMAZING STORIES science fiction/science fact magazine, Dec. 1946 issue, p. 162. The letter was from a George A. Lehew of (at the time) 1918 W. Newport Ave., Chicago, ILL. Lehew wrote: \"Sirs... I have been a reader of AMAZING STORIES for a very long time... I too, know of one of these entrances into the world below. It is about fifty miles south of Pittsburgh, Pa., in the first range of the Allegheny Mountains. My experiment with the caves have been only partial explorations, consisting of traveling about a mile and a quarter down into the cave itself, and returning. The cave IS VENTILATED from below, and stays at a constant 50 degrees no matter what the outside temperature may be. It is a series of rooms or galleries with narrow passages from one to another. In about the sixth room down, there is a large tree trunk which could not have come from the surface as the stratosphere (sic) is almost completely free from local fault; and it could never have come DOWN through the openings in the cave itself as they were small at the top, and kept getting progressively larger as they got deeper. \"I traveled down as long as I could find comparatively easy travel--about 45 degree"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"descent all the way--and finally came to what I thought must be the end of the cave, for I could see no more openings into rooms, but on closer examination found instead a bore, about six feet across, straight down into solid rock. I turned my flash downward and could see that it must have gone straight down for at least a hundred feet, the sides were perfectly smooth, and the shaft, or bore, in a perfect round--no apparent irregularities anywhere--I had no way of descending any further, so I retraced my steps back up through the different rooms to the top of the mountain where the cave opens into this world. I made discreet inquiries of several old timers in that region, and found that in 1915, or about that year, six surveyors took gear and equipment, and spent a month in exploration of the cave, going 18 miles from the entrance, and down almost five miles below sea level. I have never gone back, but I hope to some day in the future, with escort, equipment, and supplies. I'd certainly love to see the machine that made that bore! If you have any information on other caves in that area, let me know-- they too may tie in with this one, though if they do, their connections are very deep. Also, if you can, please describe the equipment that made that vertical shaft. Oh, yes, one more interesting item--the surveyors in their exploration of the cave, distinctly heard the rumble of MACHINERY--but their calculations proved they were nowhere near a large city (surface), and they were too deep for surface noises otherwise. What is the answer?\" Another account dealing with subsurface phenomena and creatures appeared in the June, 1945 issue of AMAZING STORIES, in a letter submitted to that magazine by Jerry LaPriore (at the time) of 2024 Pleasant St., Fall River, Mass. The letter stated: \"You asked for stories that might relate to... the caves. My mother was told this story by an old man who said it was true as truth itself: This man and a friend were hunting, agreeing this time to go to a portion of the wood's to which they did not normally go. They saw a deer and gave chase. It jumped through a clump of bushes and they followed--to find themselves unaccountably in the strangest surroundings. They were in a huge cavern that had numerous passageways leading from it. Before them was a monster-like man they thought was the Devil himself. The monster stared, and the two men stared back. One of them fainted from fear, and the man who told my mother the story dragged the other away in panic, and as he did so, found himself just as mysteriously in the forest again. The old man's friend died a week later as a result of the shock he had suffered. The old man tried later to find the cave again, but failed. I know this story is true because my mother does not tell fairy tales and because she believes it.\" The previous letters appeared in the wake of the so-called \"Shaver Mystery\" which occupied the pages of AMAZING STORIES Magazine throughout the years 1945- 1950. The \"mystery\" was based on the writings of a welder by the name of Richard S. Shaver, who had written several admittedly science fact-fiction stories after his initial manuscript A WARNING TO FUTURE MAN (which was re-written into \"science fiction\" format by A.S. editor Ray Palmer) originally appeared in AMAZING STORIES. These stories dealt with an underground world inhabited by human-like people called \"Tero's\" and their mortal enemies - grotesque, inhuman creatures called \"Dero's\". Both of these \"races\" allegedly had access to ancient \"recovered\" technologies including a machine which supposedly projected encephalographic thought-waves via rays electronically over long distances. Richard Shaver claimed to have visited this subterranean realm only once physically - entering via row-boat through a shore-side cave hidden in a bay somewhere east of Washington D.C. Incidentally, as we've indicated elsewhere, there are accounts which allege that an entire system of ancient \"Atlantean\" tunnels with extremely hard, glazed linings have been discovered beneath the D.C. area, and that"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"these ultimately lead to an ancient \"Atlantean\" subterranean complex which some say was in ancient times, and is still now, known as \"NOD\" - could this be a reference to the descendants of Cain? - see: Gen. 4:13-16 and also the book \"WEIRD AMERICA\", by Jim Branden., (E.P. Dutton & Co., N.Y. 1978). Shaver claims that while visiting his \"Tero\" friends in their underground city they were suddenly and without warning attacked by a group of several \"Dero\" who wielded beam-like weapons, yet Shaver himself for reasons unknown was spared. After the attackers left, and after he realized that all of his \"friends\" in the underground city were dead, Shaver allegedly then left the subterranean realm the way he came and never physically returned. This was the only physical and tangible encounter Shaver claimed to have had. After this, he says, the \"inspiration\" for his stories came in the form of messages received from these \"thought-projection\" machines. His stories, however, became much more confused and occultic after this, and even anti-Christian in nature. Although we certainly do not doubt Shaver's former sincerity (he passed away in the mid-1970's) nor his intentions, from various indications we must make the definite conclusion that the \"voices\" which he heard thereafter did not originate from the \"tero's\" utilizing thought-projection machines but actually from sources far more infernal, and perhaps reptilian, in nature - which were in fact masquerading as \"Tero's\". In other words - not denying Shaver's original encounter - the powers of darkness, we believe, began manipulating Shaver in order to spread confusion and disinformation about this underground realm and it's inhabitants, the reality of which (if we are to believe certain sources referred to earlier in these reports) was beginning to become known by certain groups on the surface such as secret societies, deep-level government agencies, and people such as George A. Lehew, Jerry LaPriore, and hundreds of others who were having physical encounters or knew of physical encounters with the outskirts of this \"nether\" world. Could this have been the reason that \"they\" spared Shaver? Is it possible that they cunningly intended to use someone to spread false information about the subterranean regions when in fact that person actually believed in the \"information\" he was receiving? We in all fairness must state that Shaver accuses RAYMOND A. PALMER of taking his writings such as the original \"A WARNING TO FUTURE MAN\" (describing an imminent invasion of the surface by a malevolent subterranean race) and \"rewriting\" it in the form of the novelette \"I REMEMBER LEMURIA\". Shaver alleges that Palmer took his writings and expanded them into a science-fiction-occult format so that the original essay would be acceptable to his science-fiction audience and gain wider exposure. If this was the case then Palmer and Shaver's plan may have backfired since many mis- led souls, aware of the basic truths of the cavern world, began flocking to AMAZING STORIES, believing every word of Shaver's re-written stories. Even though Shaver was apparently convinced that the stories he received via mental projection or the so- called \"thought-machines\" were true, they nevertheless contained many occultic, confused and contradictory ideas even before he sent them on the Palmer. However Palmer must also be implicated in this if Shaver is correct in his allegations that Palmer \"occultized\" his writings even more, and that Palmer also added the idea that the stories were based on \"racial memories\", among several other alterations. Perhaps Palmer was the one most responsible for squandering what might have potentially been a singular opportunity to educate the masses about the underground realm and the activities taking place there, and the affect some of that activity had upon the every-day lives of surface humanity. How much of the present travesty taking place in the government-reptilian scenario might have been avoided if the uncorrupted TRUTH"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"were known in the 1940's when the \"Shaver Mystery\" was hitting the news-stands and moulding the thinking of literally tens of thousands of AMAZING STORIES readers? The very methods used by Shaver and Palmer to \"warn\" the human race about this subject to some extent did just the opposite and brought ridicule on the whole field of \"paraspeleological\" research. Many of Palmer's obviously fictionalized and implausible \"additions\" to Shaver's writings, originally intended to make the subject \"palatable\" to the mass readership, may have in fact had an adverse affect. If then Shaver was being used as an unwitting \"disinformation agent\", then why would these powers of darkness - the serpent races and their demonic allies - wish to hide the truth concerning, if not the very existence of, such a nether region from surface society? We believe that the reasons are obvious. Although not all, much of this nether \"world\" is being used by the \"infernals\" as a base of operations in their ages-old \"Cosmic Conspiracy\" or conflict with the Creator and the souls- conscience of mankind. The less we on the surface know about their existence and activities, the better it will be for their hellish cause. Shaver and Palmer as we said may have been unknowing pawns who were being used to not only spread disinformation but also to bring others under the supernatural influence of these dark powers by encouraging the readers to attempt to establish \"thought-contact\" with these underground races by means which have in the past been attributed to witchcraft and the occult. Many of the researchers involved in compiling these files personally know of several people who have had their lives all but destroyed by taking \"their\" advice and, via occult methods, have attempted to contact these underworld beings via psychic or telepathic means. And after having done so have become oppressed, tormented or even possessed by beings who are absolutely malignant in nature and insensitive to humanities welfare. Also, mental illness, schizophrenia, and even suicide is not unheard of among those who have decided through occultic or witchcraft-related means to open up their spirits to any or all paraphysial beings which may be inhabiting the ether around them, in hopes of tapping-in to some benevolent subterranean beings' thought-beam. We will state here that if anyone is seeking to make their life easier by joining up with an advanced race of technological beings, whether subterrestrial or extraterrestrial, they will be disappointed, as there is no single place in the universe outside of Eternal Paradise itself where one will be completely free from the relentless attacks of the powers of darkness and their insatiable attempts to devour life and vitality wherever they may find it. This is something any society has to deal with, no matter how technologically sophisticated they may be. Physical technology cannot solve non- physical or spiritual problems. Palmer's deeply occultic philosophies are evidenced by the fact that he went on to create FATE and SEARCH magazine(s) which, although occasionally providing some useful information, nevertheless propounded the \"virtues\" of witchcraft, spiritism and the occult. Our Creator was not being insensitively strict when He warned us to stay away from dealings with the occult or the supernatural outside of his protection. He gave this command for our own good, so that we would not end up as the degenerate spiritual slaves to infernal creatures that are ever seeking to gain control of our spiritual nature. In Deuteronomy chapter 18: vs. 10-11 we read: \"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire (child or human sacrifice), or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.\" In spite of the Shaver - Palmer controversy, there actually have been other accounts"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"which have described alleged PHYSICAL encounters with the underground realm, as well as with beings known as the \"dero\" and the \"tero\". It is uncertain whether Shaver intended to describe the \"dero\" as a runaway race of antediluvian, perhaps infernally controlled, self-perpetuating androids; or as non-human reptilian beings; or as a race of mind-controlled human sorcerers. All three groups have apparently come under the term \"dero\" in Shaver's stories (and the accounts concerning them which have been related by others), possibly due to the confusion resulting from the source from which Shaver received many of his alleged \"revelations\" as well as Palmer's own occultic and science-fictionalized installments. Perhaps the term \"dero\" was ment to denote a more general de-generate state of being, rather than a particular entity!? One account, for instance, which appeared in an early issue of CAVEAT EMPTOR magazine (P.O. Box 4553., Metuchen, NJ 08820-4533), concerned a physical encounter with a HUMAN subterranean race. The account was related by an individual whose girlfriend 'Laressa' phoned him one night. She was quite shaken up and in tears, and told him that a friend of hers at school had invited her to go for a ride with her out into the countryside. This girl friend was somewhat strange, and a loner and would often disappear and be away from school for days or even weeks at a time. As they were driving in the countryside, according to 'Laressa', this girl drove the car right towards a hill and before she knew what was happening the hill opened up into an underground 'road' and they eventually found themselves right in the middle of an underground city. She went on to say that the city was used by the 'D-Forces', a human group who used the symbol of a 'wolf' (on jewelry, etc.), and who were in conflict with another human group called the 'T-Forces'. Both, she learned, possessed 'UFO' type craft, and the T-Forces were less powerful but were growing stronger day by day. This might tie-in with Shaver's \"Dero's\" and \"Tero's\". Several years ago a man by the name of Steve Brodie claimed to have been abducted into an underground base in Arizona and later found himself walking the streets of New York City six months later with little or no memory of where he had been. Brodie told his story to researcher John J. Robinson, who related it on Long John Nebel's W.O.R. radio show in New York City. Before Brodie mysteriously disappeared again he had told Robinson that he had the feeling he was 'being watched'. His only recollection of the abduction was of being in a dungeon-like cavern in a cage-like enclosure with other humans who had told him that their captors (who wore dark, hooded capes) were known as the 'dero'. This name comes up again and again, but whether it refers to sorcerers, sauroids or synthetic beings is anyones guess. Perhaps as we've suggested all three are involved!? There have nevertheless been reports of 'possible' reptilian hominoids posing as human-like beings, such as the 'reptilian' described on p. 109 of John Keel's book 'THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES': \"I am an amateur herpetologist and once kept three-fanged cobras in my New York apartment... until my concerned neighbors squealed to the Board of Health. SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ENTITIES IMPRESSED ME AS RESEMBLING SOME KIND OF REPTILE RATHER THAN HUMAN MAMMALS. I didn't mention the reptile notion to anyone. But on July 24, Lia visited Jane and refused to talk about anything but eggs. She took some eggs from Jane's refrigerator and sucked out the contents like a reptile! Jane was perplexed by this exhibition and called me soon afterward.\" And on pp. 176-177 of Signet's 1975 paperback edition of 'MOTHMEN', in reference to this, Keel states: \"...Meanwhile, Jane's phantom friends were visiting her daily and helpfully giving her surprising information about my own 'secret' investigations. My interview with the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Christiansens of Cape May, and the details of their pill-popping visitor, Tiny, was then known only to a few trusted people like Ivan Sanderson. But on June 12, Mr. Apol and his friends (the being that called itself 'Lia', referred to above, apparently being from this same group - Branton) visited Jane when she was alone in her house and asked for water so they could take some pills. Then they presented her with three of the same pills, told her to take one at that moment, and to take one other in two days. The third pill, they said, was for her to analyze to assure herself it was harmless. They undoubtedly knew she would turn it over to me. Two hours after she took the first pill she came down with a blinding headache, her eyes became bloodshot, and her vision in her right eye was affected. When her parents came home they expressed concern because her eyes were glassy and her right eye seemed to have a cast. The sample pill proved to be a SULFA DRUG normally prescribed for infections of the urinary tract...\" The possible significance of the \"Sulfa\" drugs will become apparent later on in these 'Files'. Theodore Illion, in his book 'DARKNESS OVER TIBET', the inhabitants of an underground city beneath Tibet which the author claimed to have stumbled on. This underground community was allegedly ruled over by a powerful sorcerer who was part of an international secret society and who kept the inhabitants, many of whom were people who had 'disappeared' from the world above, under complete mind control to the point that they lacked any personality, their eyes were vacant and empty, and their lives were emotionless and drone-like, much like an ant colony. This sorcerer was allegedly in contact with an infernal race via a 'bottomless shaft' which descended through the city itself. Keep in mind the 'drone-like' aspect of certain people tied-in with reptilian activity, as it is a common threat than can be found in other caves and Caverns. These two accounts (Illion's and especially \"Laressa's\" account as given in CAVEAT EMPTOR) tend to confirm that two opposing (?) beliefs somewhat similar to the conflict between socialism on the left and fascism on the right, have caused a great deal of conflict between many HUMAN inhabitants of these nether regions. When we consider that socialism and fascism are apparently being manipulated by the same source, ie. the Illuminati (which in turn as we've seen is ultimately controlled by the serpent race) in order to turn humanity against itself so they can more readily be kept under subjection and control; then is it possible that a similar scenario is taking place in human civilizations beneath the surface of this planet? There is evidence that the Illuminati is not only aware of the existence of these subsurface communities (for instance the subterranean connection apparently existing beneath the Masonic U.S. headquarters of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite located in the \"House of the Temple\" within Washington D.C.) but is intricately involved in manipulating it's affairs as it has done in surface society. So we see how it may be possible that the entire planet, whether surface or subsurface societies, may be subject to Reptilian - serpent cult - Illuminati manipulation via the Jesuit-Rosicrucian-Masonic movements. The CAVEAT EMPTOR account, as well as many others which have been gathered by various writers, seems to indicate that these two \"factions\" which largely exist among the subterranean civilizations are known as the T-Forces (Tero's) and the D-Forces (Dero's). Each of these apparently \"worship\" either the positive or negative aspects of the electromagnetic \"force\", possibly similar to the so-called \"light side\" and the \"dark side\" of the \"force\" as depicted in the STAR WARS series. We realize that this concept may sound rather strange to us on the surface, but when we realize that intense electromagnetic currents may exist deep beneath the earth then it is entirely possible that any human civilization which might inhabit those regions may attempt to utilize this"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"energy source to the point of utter dependence. If this is the case, then both of these groups would not be worshipping \"God\" in the Judeo-Christian sense, but rather a form of pantheistic nature-worship, the worship of CREATED FORCES RATHER THAN THE ONE WHO CREATED THOSE FORCES. This is not to say that ALL who inhabit these regions adhere to this peculiar belief system. There have been several accounts concerning individuals who have encountered human beings - some who spoke the native language and others who spoke a language entirely foreign - within deep underground tunnels and caverns. There are many such cases, but we will refer to only one of these at this point (and will reserve the others for later in the text), an incident which may be one the most well-known and most well-documented accounts of this type: Sometime during the 12 century, a monastic chronicler in England by the name of \"Gervase of Tilbury\" recorded a strange account of two \"children\" who suddenly appeared near a small town near Bury St. Edmunds, England. The account was also recorded in the writings of several other chroniclers who lived at the time or sometime afterwards. These include: William of Newbury - HISTORIA RERUM ANGLICARUM, written in Yorkshire, England (1136-1198?); Abbot Ralph of Coggeshall - CHRONICON ANGLICARUM; and also the chroniclers Giraldus Cambrensis and Walsingham. The account was more recently related in FLYING SAUCERS UNCENSORED, by Harold T. Wilkins (Citadel Press., New York, N.Y. 1955., pp.97- 98). From their combined accounts we can piece together the following bizarre story which the chroniclers swore to be true. One warm, sunny day in the 12th century some farmers and other residents of the small town of Wolfpittes, England - some seven miles distant from the larger village of Bury St. Edmunds - were startled to see two young children wandering around as if disoriented in some ancient \"pits\" or \"trenches\" known to the locals as the \"Wolf-Pitts\", after which the small village had taken it's name. These excavations were ancient, but no one seemed to know when or by whom they were dug, but the consensus was that they were at least partly artificial, and very ancient. The most shocking thing about the children, which the residents of Wolfpittes encountered, was that they had skin which was olive-green in colour, yet the rest of their features were as human as the average Englishman. The villagers attempted to communicate with the children but were unsuccessful as they soon discovered that the young boy and girl spoke a language which was completely unfamiliar to the villagers. The townspeople had compassion on the children and took them to the village and offered them various different kinds of food, all of which they seemed unfamiliar with and which they refused. However, when they were shown some beanstalks, they took them greedily, but instead of opening the bean-pods, the children attempted to open the stalks themselves, as if they had been accustomed to opening stalks in this way (apparently a practice they had learned in the land from which they emerged). Upon finding nothing in the stalks, the children began to weep. Unfortunately, the shock of entering our world was too much for the young boy, and even though he became partly acclimated to other forms of food, he nevertheless became weaker and weaker and finally died a few years afterwards. The young girl, however, adjusted quite well to her new surroundings. In fact she eventually grew into a mature, beautiful woman, and later married a gentleman from the nearby town of Kings Lynn. As time passed, her husband patiently instructed her in the complexities of the English language, and soon she was able to communicate fairly well, and the story she told of where she had come from and how she had arrived in"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"our \"world\" with her brother was even more incredible. She told her husband that her people all had skin similar to hers, or rather to what her skin had once been like, as over a period of years the greenish tinge had left her. She described her world as a cavernous, subterranean country of enormous size, a country which went by the name of \"St. Martin's Land.\" The land in which she lived was described as \"twilight\" in nature, yet there was a large underground river, on the other side of which there was another land more brightly lit. One day, she and her brother were herding some type of underground animal when they heard something like the sound of \"bells\" emerging from one of the cave passages or tunnels which lined the perimeter of this underground land. Out of extreme curiosity, they entered this tunnel and followed the passage upwards for what could have been a few days, although in their underground land they probably did not have any concept of what \"day\" or \"night\" was. After their long and weary journey up the steep incline they suddenly emerged into the brilliant sunlight of the British countryside. The change from their twilight world was dramatic, and the children walked around in the pits or trenches starved, half- blinded and disoriented. They shortly afterwards attempted to re-locate the small opening through which they had emerged, but were unable to do so, because of the blinding light. At about this point the farmers found them and took them to the village. A somewhat similar incident \"may\" have been repeated in the small hamlet of Banjos (or Banos) Spain in August of 1887, several hundred years after the incident at Wolfpittes and several hundred miles distant. We state that it MAY have been repeated to some degree simply because there seems to be some confusion surrounding the Banjos account, apparently due to the possibility that some well-meaning researcher may have confused the two incidents, in essence attributing some of the events that in fact took place near Wolfpittes with the Banjos account. Basically, the Banjos incident reportedly had to do with two children who emerged from a CAVERN near the town (not \"pits\" or \"excavations\"), spoke an unknown language, and so on, although the details are sketchy. Some of the accounts of the Banjos incident repeat the Wolfpittes story almost verbatim, as if, as we said, someone somewhere mistakenly confused the two incidents, perhaps due to a lack of detail in the Banjos, Spain account. Whatever the case, it seems that SOMETHING of this general nature also occurred in this Spanish hamlet, even though the exact sources of the story are much more difficult to trace than are the sources for the Wolfpittes account. Paris Flammonde refers to this account in his book: THE AGE OF FLYING SAUCERS (Hawthorn Books, N.Y., p. 197), having learned it from an article in the September, 1967 issue of ORBIT Magazine, which in turn gave credit to an article in the Vol. XII, August 1967 issue of Dan Fry's UNDERSTANDING Magazine. Fry claimed that he got the story from an article by John Macklin which appeared in the December, 1966 issue of GRIT Magazine. The account also appears in John Macklin's book STRANGE DESTINIES (Ace Books., N.Y.); Jacques Bergier's LES EXTRA-TERRESTRES; and also appeared in the British periodical WEEKEND, on July 22, 1970. Most accounts tend to support the idea that this nether world is basically inhabited by both HUMAN beings (of many types - ranging from large to small and from relatively peaceful or \"neutral\" to defensive and violent, usually the latter being controlled or manipulated by the infernal inhabitants of these lower regions); and also inhabited by REPTILIAN beings (of many types), ALL of which are apparently very dangerous and indifferent or outright malicious against the human race and human life. Many of these as we've said are extremely intelligent, although these creatures sometimes, according to various accounts, appear behind occult- technological or biogenetically induced human-like \"disguises\" in order to increase"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"their dominion and control through infiltration, subversion, etc. All indications seem to point to the fact that these creatures, irreparably fallen and corrupted as a race since the events of ancient Eden, have no soul nor conscience or redeeming virtues but simply operate from parasitical-like motives of gaining power and control over all creation and all life by any and all means according to their predatory nature. This infernal nature is no more thoroughly portrayed than in an incident which took place several years ago near the small town of Dixonville, Pennsylvania. On July 14th, 1974 an article by Stoney Brakefield appeared in the Pennsylvania newspaper, NEWS EXTRA, reporting an incident which allegedly took place in 1944 near this small coal mining town, yet because of it's nature it had been covered-up for nearly 40 years until the son of the mining inspector who investigated the incident revealed it as his father (then deceased) had related it to him. This mining inspector and a fellow investigator had been called in to look into a \"cave- in\" in one of the Dixonville mines. About 15 men had either been killed or turned up missing altogether in the strange disaster. Once inside the mine the inspectors eventually came across the first victim. Although lying under a broken timber surrounded by some fallen rocks and rubble, they concluded that the cave-in certainly could not have been large enough to kill the man. The inspectors were shocked to find that the body of the miner was lacerated with claw-like markings from some unknown creature. They continued and found a few other bodies, all dead and some of which had similar claw-like marks covering them. Several other miners had vanished, and were nowhere to be seen in spite of subsequent diggings. This tragedy apparently took place after the miners had broken into an ancient tunnel of unknown origin deep in the mine. This tunnel (at the time the inspectors didn't fully recognize it as the recently discovered passage or drift) was then followed by the inspectors at approximately a 45 degree angle downwards for about half a mile until they arrived at a \"room\" which \"seemed\" to be the end of the passage. At this point the passage behind them just \"happened\" to collapse (many accounts indicate that these underground creatures can create \"cave-ins\" at will, as was the case in the Maltese incident mentioned in earlier texts). A follow-up team was sent in to intersect the inspectors while this was taking place. This other crew followed the tracks of the inspectors into the mysterious tunnel and eventually found the \"cave-in\" and began digging through in hopes of finding the now missing investigators. In the meanwhile one inspector (the father of the man who released the story to the press) suddenly felt something like \"hot breath\" on the back of his neck. He closed his eyes, too terrified to see what the \"thing\" was. As the other workers were breaking through, the \"creature\" left, perhaps frightened away. The other inspector who was with him however observed the whole thing and in wild-eyed horror he exclaimed, \"That thing was not of this world!\" The possibility that an ancient reptilian-saurian race may exist below the surface of this planet is not an idea which is relatively new. This infernal yet physical race has been refereed to in spiritual and historical records which date back to the beginning of time. Ancient Hebrew history, for instance, records that our human ancestors were not the only intelligent, free will beings who inhabited the ancient world. Genesis chapter 3 refers to the \"Serpent\", which according to many ancient Hebrew scholars was identified with a hominoid or bi-ped reptilian being. The ancient Hebrew word for \"Serpent\" is \"Nachash\" (which according to STRONG'S COMPREHENSIVE and other Biblical concordances contained in itself the meanings: Reptile, Enchantment, Hissing, Whisper, Diligently Observe, Learn by Experience, Incantation, Snake, etc. all of which"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"may be descriptive of the serpent-sauroid race which we have been referring to). The original \"Nachash\" was not actually a \"snake\" as most people believe, but actually an extremely intelligent, cunning creature possessed with the ability to speak and reason. It also stood upright as we've said, as did many of it's descendants, the small \"saurian\" predators which ambled about on two legs. Many of these reptilian creatures retained their bi-pedal form while others mutated via natural selection, adaptation and atrophication into the other \"saurian\" species. The Hebrew account stated that the serpent race (at one time uncorrupted) irreparably sold itself out to demonic entities in exchange for occultic powers and dominion over the human race, since the Adamic race had been given dominion over the earth and \"the beasts\" (ie. all non-human creatures) by Jehovah Himself. The fact that \"the Beast\" now for a large part rules over man is to some extent mans fault. These infernally-empowered beings, who once roamed the surface of the planet and preyed on humanity, were later forced to go underground and make their abode in the subterranean networks which honeycomb the sub-crust of the earth. From these nether regions they have for thousands of years been carrying out their ancient and secret warfare against God and the souls of men, whom they hate intensely. Some years ago a lady by the name of Robin Collyns wrote an article referring to this serpent race and it's influence upon the human race throughout history. Collyns was of the opinion that (as these creatures alleged) the serpent race \"created\" man and planted him on this planet. All indications however strongly point to the fact that this is just one of many propagandist lies which this infernal race propagates. If these reptilian deceivers can convince man that \"they\" created us and therefore they are our \"creator-gods\" so-to-speak, then we will be all the more likely to bow down and submit to these vermin in worshipful adoration. Since their \"race\" has long since lost any concept of righteousness or moral integrity, \"they\" will not think twice about using deception or whatever means at their disposal in order to advance their over-all CONTROL of all things. Deception is and has been for thousands of years second nature to them, and therefore any statement made by them should be considered in light of this fact. John Lear alleges, based on what his sources have told him, that these entities, the saurian \"greys\", etc., even claim to have created Jesus. Even Lear regards this claim with great suspicion, believing that it is one of many attempts by these creatures to undermine traditional values in order to gain further control. Not to mention Jesus Himself condemned the serpent race of being in league with Satan and his demonic hierarchy! Collyns' article nevertheless contained some useful information concerning the ancient influence of these creatures, which we quote: \"...Old Sumerian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek legends refer to the \"serpent\" deities who were believed to have once resided in the \"underworld\". The Garden of Eden in this context takes on additional interest and significance, possibly of paramount importance. Pristine legends from AUSTRALIA and the PACIFIC ISLANDS offer innumerable references to serpent deities/beings who were anciently associated with the creation enigma in the area (Note: There are in fact several accounts of caverns in Australia. \"...The spiral serpent symbol is found throughout the Pacific and is associated universally with the creation enigma... From earliest days, the serpent symbol is to be seen in many parts of the world, but undoubtedly the most fascinating portrayal is a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"detail on an Egyptian \"magical\" papyrus in the British Museum depicting a serpent encompassed by a ray-emitting disk. The most unusual form of the serpent symbol is a spiral representing a coiled snake; it has been discovered as petroglyphs and other pictorial representations in Britain, Greece, Malta, and Egypt, as pottery designs in New Mexico; as ground drawings on the Nazca Plateau, Peru, and throughout the Pacific Islands (Note: Nearly every site mentioned here has also been the site of intense subterranean activity and encounters with sauroid beings, as the reader may recall and as he or she will see further in the text - Branton). \"...Aborigine legends,\" Collyns concludes, \"indicate that the serpent beings were not above waging war, and an identical parallel is also mentioned in the Hindu legends of the Nagas, serpent beings who came from one of seven worlds... Aborigine legends (state that) the serpent beings waged many wars around Ayers Rock, and the vertical gutters in Ayers Rock testify to these wars.\" The Nagas \"seven worlds\", by the way are, according to Hindu tradition, actually seven LEVELS of a subterranean nether world from where these Nagas, or serpent beings, originate. In \"THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT,\" the Rev. John Bathurst Deane made the following statements and observations: \"...One of (the) five builders of Thebes was named after the serpent-god of the Phoenicians, OPHION... The first alter erected to Cecrops at Athens, was to \"Ops\", the serpent-deity... The symbolical worship of the serpent was so common in Greece, that Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing it into the mysteries of all their gods... The Chinese... are said to be 'superstitious in choosing a plot of ground to erect a dwelling-house or sepulchre: conferring it with the head, tail and feet of diverse dragons which live UNDER OUR EARTH.'\" The Rev. Deane also states that hierograms or depictions of a circle (representing the sun) with wings and serpents emanating from it are predominant features \"in the Persian, Egyptian, and Mexican hieroglyphics. China, Hindustan, Greece, Italy, and Asia Minor, as distinctly through more rarely, exhibit it; and it has even been found in Britain.\" (THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT TRACED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, by the Rev. John Bathurst Deane., London., J.G. & F. Rivington., 1833) In his book \"VENOMOUS REPTILES\" (Charles Ceaibrer Sons, N.Y. 1969), author Shirman A. Minton Jr., an expert on reptilian and amphibian biology, reveals some peculiar scientific facts concerning \"reptiles\". These facts include the following: A) All reptiles have scales, B) All are cold-blooded, C) All lay eggs, D) All reptiles with well-developed limbs have clawed toes, E) THERE ARE 'LIZARDS' WITH ELONGATED SNAKE-LIKE BODIES - A TYPE OF 'MISSING LINK' BETWEEN THE LIZARDS AND THE SNAKES, F) THE MODERN EVIDENCE (SCIENTIFIC) INDICATES THAT ALL MODERN SNAKES ONCE (IN THE DISTANT ANCESTRAL PAST) POSSESSED LIMBS WHICH BECAME \"ATROPHIED\" THROUGH NON-USE, perhaps due to the fact they they BECAME aquatic or semi-aquatic creatures (Note: Snakes incidentally bare both aquatic AND land creatures, and can travel through either environment, as evidenced by the fact that snakes have often been seen swimming across rivers and lakes, etc. Not only Holy Scripture, but scientific evidence as well, indicates that \"snakes\" at one time in the ancient past had limbs but lost them in the process of time, while other"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"reptilian species, at least for the present, have retained their limbs - Branton), G) REPTILES WITH \"DEVELOPED LIMBS\" USUALLY LIVE \"UNDERGROUND\"! The book \"VENOMOUS REPTILES\" also states the following: \"...Cobras (according to legends) are descended from the Nagas, Serpent gods of Bharat, or ancient India. Their worship has been traced to prehistoric Dravidian times before the Aryan invasion of the subcontinent in almost 1600 B.C. The Naga's power to inflict disproportionate physical damage or almost instantaneous death is explained in the Hindu Vedas as paralleling the energy of creation or fire.\" The book goes on to state that, A) The Naga's are said to have appeared at the birth of Guatama Siddharta, who later became \"Buddha\". - Note: The \"Serpent\" also played a large part in the legends surrounding another Hindu religious figure, ie. \"Krishna.\", B) The ancient \"well\" of Sheshna in Benares, India, is traditionally where the YOGA APHORISMS OF PATANJALI, a classical guide to students of Yoga, was written.\" This \"well\" is said to be an entrance to one of the Naga's underworld lairs. Take note that the same pattern of deception we see here is apparently similar to that which was used against Eve as recorded in Genesis chapter 3. Satan, working through the present-day \"sold-out\" saurian race (the seed of the Serpent), inspired or inspires these misguided Hindu's, Buddhists, Masons, etc. (the seed of the Woman) with blasphemous doctrines based upon the lie of the original Serpent or Nachash as recorded in the Genesis account: \"Ye shall be as gods\", a teaching which is at the very heart of occultic Yoga philosophy; ie. that by \"tapping in\" to the so-called \"universal serpent force\" one could gain supernatural powers and thereby become a \"god\". Such an occult practice was carried out by Adolph Hitler and the theosophist-rosicrucian- jesuit connected occultists who surrounded him, but instead of tapping-in to the mythical \"universal force\" they instead opened themselves up to hideous demonic powers which had masqueraded behind the deceptive facade of such a pantheistic \"force\". How else can one explain the horrible atrocities which were carried out by the Nazi's during World War II? There are indications that Hitler and his occult societies may have subsequently come into contact with this serpent race, believe it or not. These include the face that: Hitler had himself read \"THE COMING RACE,\" written by the Rosicrucian Grandmaster Bulwer Lytton, describing an underground race which \"tapped\" a supposed force called \"vril\", identical to the Hindu's \"serpent force': Hitler had, after his rise to power, sent out numerous secret expeditions to nearly every continent including Antarctica, in order to explore ancient ruins and especially old mines and caverns in attempts to find geographical areas suitable for establishing underground \"bases\" of operation; A strange cult of Tibetan occultist-monks were actually found in some of the bombed-out ruins in Berlin near the end of the war, who had been killed by the blasts - there were also rumors that Tibetan monks were assisting Hitler in the establishment of a \"demonic\" world order and religion. Again, we are not \"condemning\" any particular group of persons who may have been born into a society which has unfortunately fallen victim to the deception of the draconian. Many of these people grew up in a society where \"tradition\" and \"religion\" are one and the same, or in other words they are - whether they like it or not - \"members\" of their religion (whether it be Far Eastern occultism or other) from birth. Reptilian-inspired \"religion\" is forced upon a person against their will, for to deny religion would be to deny their tradition. In contrast to this, the religion of \"The Lamb\" does not force itself on anyone through fear and intimidation nor through traditional dogmatism; but offers itself freely to all who will receive it without condemnation. The"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"way of \"The Serpent\" uses deception disguised as \"secret initiation into higher knowledge\" in order to manipulate a person towards believing the reptilian propaganda which they would use to get the believer to eventually worship their race. The way of \"The Lamb\" does not use secrecy or manipulation, but is open and honest and has nothing to hide, and therefore has no need for \"secret\" or \"occult\" society. Unlike \"The Serpent\" which must hide in the darkness for fear of being discovered for what it really is, \"The Lamb\" has nothing to hide and does not fear scrutiny nor challenge, being absolutely perfect in every way. Therefore, this is not an attempt to \"condemn\" Hindus, Buddhists, Masons, nor any other such group of persons, but an attempt to show them that there is another and a better path. The book \"VENOMOUS REPTILES\" also states that \"Sheshna's well\", an alleged opening into the underground reptilian realm of \"Patala\", may be seen today in Benares, India, and according to Minton, it's author: \"It has forty steps leading down into a circular depression to a stone door covered with cobras. This is said to lead to PATALA, the reptile netherworld.\" Buddhist occultists like Robert E. Dickhoff, in his book \" AGHARTA \" (Health Research, Mokelumne Hill, CA), a somewhat \"occultized\" and confused look at the subterranean civilizations of Asia, nevertheless describes one event which seems to tie-in with various accounts which we have given earlier and which we will relate further on. According to Dickhoff, or rather from what he learned from certain Buddhist monks, some time in the ancient past an Asian prince and his followers had learned that a subterranean race of reptilian-like hominoids were causing a great deal of harm in the surface world through their attempts to manipulate the minds of those on the surface through \"witchcraft\" and \"sorcery\". This Asian prince eventually led an army of followers into the tunnels and caverns below central Asia and encountered the reptilian or \"lizard\" people. After a considerable conflict the reptilians- saurians were driven out of these ancient caverns and the (antediluvian?) subterranean cities which later became known as \"Agharta\". Ever since that time the reptilians, according to Dickhoff, have been plotting a re- takeover of these caverns and have been using occult \"channels\" to spread propaganda which would favor their cause. In his book \"ON THE SHORES OF ENDLESS WORLDS\" (Souvenir Press), Andrew Tomas gives some additional information concerning the \"Nagas\" or the \"Serpent People\" who are believed to originate from a gigantic underworld cavern network below central Asia and the Far East. On p. 160 of his book Tomas states: \"...Even in this jet-age every Hindu is familiar with and usually believes in the legend of the Nagas, the \"serpents\" which live in extensive underground palaces in the rocky Himalayas. It is believed that these creatures are able to fly in space and that they possess amazing magical powers and intelligence. They are not too fond of man if he is a curiosity seeker, explorer or mountaineer. According to the sacred(?) tradition of the Hindus, the deep caverns of the Nagas contain fabulous treasures, illuminated by flashing precious stones. The subterranean abodes are known to be in certain parts of both the Himalayas and Tibet, particularly around the Lake of the Great Nagas - Lake Manosarowar.\" Take note of the remarkable similarity between this description and medieval traditions of hideous and malevolent \"dragons\" who lived in dark underground lairs along with kidnapped human maidens and \"stolen treasures.\" We've all heard of these tales, which most have formerly attributed to fantasy. However, could such tales actually be"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"rooted in subconscious awareness of actual realities? Andrew Tomas describes his own personal encounters with those who claimed to have knowledge of these subterranean and space-travelling creatures. On pp. 166-168 he states: \"...I decided to go to the Kulu Valley in the Western part of the Himalayas to visit Naggar, where Nicholas Roerich had lived. Since I had known him personally, the trip had sentimental overtone. A narrow curving road, a precipice on one side with rocks and avalanches on the other, were not conductive to an enjoyable journey to this remote region near Ladakh and Tibet. The village of Naggar derives its name from NAGA, the serpent. High up in the mountains lies Roerich's estate. Having been an artist of note, his two-sided house contains a museum of his paintings. \"As I began my ascent on the mountain path, I saw a tall grey-haired sadhu (hermit), sitting by a mountain torrent. In his hand he held a cobra-shaped staff, which together with the markings on his forehead, signified that he was a devotee of Shiva. During the earlier, more peaceful times of the British Raj, these pilgrims would travel to the Lake of the Great Nagas, Lake Manosarowar, or to Mount Kailas, the abode of Shiva (a \"god\" apparently tied-in with the Nagas - Branton), in Tibetan territory. I climbed the mountain and reached the terrace on which Roerich's house is built. I spent an hour studying (his) paintings. On the way back I admired the narrow valley and the looming snow-capped mountain ridges on both sides. \"The sadhu was still there. I thought, 'A place called Naggar, a devotee of the Nagas with the cobra staff, if he does not know something about the Nagas, then who does?'\" After Andrew Tomas asked this man, apparently a misguided member of a serpent cult, if he knew anything about the \"Nagas\" or the serpent beings, the pagan devotee responded: \"'I am a poor sadhu, I know nothing, sahib. But about twenty years ago my yogi teacher went into the mountain kingdom of the Nagas. Bright lights everywhere, big halls like Taj Mahal... The Nagas have many, many things and machines. They are clever, like Cambridge men, may be more clever, sahib,' the sadhu said with an apologetic smile... \"'Your yogi must have been a Rishi. Don't the Nagas destroy men with their sting?' I asked. \"'Yes, though the Nagas are gods and wish nothing but good to man, they do not like men who have no business near their palaces,' he replied.\" One can see here the poor, miss-guided and indeed self-contradicting mentality of many of those souls who are caught up in the \"serpents cults\" throughout the world. In response to Thomas' accusations that THE NAGAS DESTROY MEN WITH THEIR STING, this \"devotee\" agrees with him and states \"Yes\" (they do destroy human lives). However, he then goes on to make the absolutely contradicting statement that THE NAGAS ARE GODS AND WISH NOTHING BUT GOOD TO MAN. This poor soul like so many others, apparently desiring to worship a supernatural power \"greater\" than himself, had actually been deceived into devoting himself to creatures which are in fact a deadly threat to man and are apparent \"gods\" only in the sense that their intellectual capacity allows them to develop and utilize advanced forms of occult-technology. This"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"apparent schizophrenic or self-contradicting thinking may result from the devotee's DESIRE to believe he was worshipping benevolent entities while at the same time subconsciously acknowledging the threat that these creatures pose to human life is very real as well. Many of these people may have grown up with such false teachings and, simply because there was no alternative presented to them, ended up worshipping the serpent race or \"The Beast\" (This does not mean that they are beyond salvation as those who take \"the mark\" of the Beast of Revelation ch. 13 will be, who in essence will through a world-wide initiation willfully turn over their own WILLPOWER to \"the Beast\" in exchange for supernatural \"godlike\" powers. These will be irredeemable since their WILLS will no longer be theirs and therefore they will be unable to \"choose\" to return to the God of the Universe). This aspect of being taught a particular belief- system from birth has to do with the so-called \"law of first report\", a powerful force which states in essence that a person who learns one set of teachings BEFORE hearing of a contradictory viewpoint will often defend the teaching which he heard \"first\" to the death, whether that teaching it right or wrong. The sad fact is, such serpent-race-inspired cults condemn critical, analytical thinking and demand absolute and blind allegiance and obedience to the \"masters\". The God of Judeo-Christian revelation is not so intimidated by men's efforts to examine His Word, but instead encourages man to \"PROVE\" His Word, His Prophecies, and the Scientific and Historical reliability of his revelations in an HONEST manner. Unfortunately, many of the serpent cult followers have been so ingrained from childhood with these lies that it is very difficult to break free from such traditions when they are older. Many of these will not listen to critical arguments against their already-established views simply for prides sake, or because of the fear or possibility of being proven wrong. This is also true with the many modern \"lodge-religions\" which are outwardly \"Christian\" yet inwardly pagan, and which play upon the human ego and the desire for \"secret knowledge\" which will somehow supposedly make them SUPERIOR to their fellow man if they can \"make the grade\" by being initiated into the \"inner core\"; and most who reach this \"inner core\" must admit if they are honest with their own conscience that much of what they supposedly \"learned\" there is actually contradictory to what they learned in the lower or outer \"levels\" when they first joined-up with such a religious movement. We would say that these \"hybrid\" religions which attempt to fuse the contradicting teachings of the \"Serpent\" and the \"Lamb\" together (the first such post-deluvian cult being the ancient Babylonian Mystery Religion built around the tower of \"Babel\" or tower of \"Confusion\") are far more dangerous than the Serpent Cults themselves, as they are more likely to lead souls hungry for truth to their destruction when actually the initiate or member believes that they are on the path of light because SOME of the teachings actually AR$E based on a perverted form of truth. Jesus said \"A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump\" (I Cor. 5:6), or a little lie can corrupt a great deal of truth. A little \"serpents venom\" of self-deification, self-centeredness or selfish ego-worship can utterly destroy and corrupt any benefit of any TRUTH which the Creator would plant in a human heart, truth based on the teaching of putting God and others first and in so doing bringing about a better society, and thus PERSONAL benefit. Andrew Tomas continues by describing other subterranea-related accounts in his book \"ON THE SHORES OF ENDLESS WORLDS\": \"... Traditions of vaults, labyrinths, tunnels and buried treasures of remote antiquity are found in Crete, Egypt, Tibet, Angkor, India, Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. The legends usually connected with the cult of the Serpent come especially in Egypt, Crete,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Angkor, Tibet, India and Mexico.\" Tomas also describes one account on p. 165 which stated that an \"Arab fraternity\" had knowledge of and access to a \"subterranean gallery under the Sphinx\" near Giza, Egypt which is sealed by an artificial barrier of flame. Such subterranean \"barriers\" have been described in other accounts, and are often described as a \"sheet\" of bluish flame. There are many accounts other than this one given by Andrew Tomas which tell of hidden subterranean tunnels, labyrinths, chambers and caverns - even subterranean people - which have allegedly been seen beneath the Cairo, Egypt region. Such accounts also spread to South America, as we can see by Tomas description (p. 158) of an alleged sub-terran system beneath Peru: \"Legend has it that a vast subterranean network exists in the Andes. This would infer engineering skill of the highest calibre which the early inhabitants of South America did not lack. The megalithic stonework of Tiahuanaco has to be seen to be believed. Stones are fitted together with insets without cement as if they were ivory and not 20- ton stone blocks. These ruins were ancient even at the time of the Conquest, nor could the Indians of the period provide an answer as to the identity of the Titan-builders. Another puzzle at Tiahuanaco is the absence of burial sites in the complex. Does the reign of the Tiahuanacan Empire... go back to an unknown chapter of prehistory?\" On p. 159 Mr. Tomas gives yet another account concerning Tiahuanaco and the strange subterranean tunnels which allegedly undermine the area: \"The Jesuit Agnelio Oliva (1572-1542) recorded the words of an old Inca quipu reader to the effect that the real Tiahuanaco was a subterranean city exceeding the one above ground in vastness. It was believed that the entrance to the underground apartments could be gained through four tunnels. Last century one passage was evidently found as treasure hunters managed to get in, to look for gold, but only one came out. He brought out with him two gold bars but left behind his sanity. After this incident the Peruvian government decided to wall up the cave entrance...\" This tunnel, according to other sources, was actually hidden among the ruins of Fort Sacsahuaman outside of and above Cuzco, Peru. The explorers allegedly found their way into ancient treasure caves beneath the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco, and most of them subsequently became lost in the dark labyrinthine maze, except for the man who returned with two gold bars. There are however \"rumors\" that the tunnels beneath Cuzco eventually connect with others in different parts of the Peruvian Andes. In this file we have dealt extensively with the saurian-type reptilian entities. However, not all of the \"reptilians\" encountered during subsurface incidents are of the infernal, \"sauroid-reptilian\" type. Some sources indicate that conflict between two \"reptilian\" groups has existed for hundreds of years and perhaps millennia, and is increasing in more recent times. The major centers of activity for one group of semi-reptilian humans, according to several sources, is in a network of subterranean caverns which exist a few miles beneath the surface of California and surrounding regions. One of their major \"Capitol\" centers of this hidden society is alleged to be a subterranean city by the name of \"Telos\", which is actually a Greek work meaning \"uttermost\". Telos is said in itself to be inhabited by over a million persons, many of whom claim ancient ancestral ties with the old Mayan civilizations. Telos is said to be one of 7 or more subterranean cities below the United States which may have been in existence since antediluvian times and which were apparently re-discovered and re-established by various early native inhabitants of the Americas. Also, some sources claim that there is \"reptilians\" that have an alliance with Oriental Subterranean humans from the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\"Agharta Empire\". There is evidence that the subterranean network beneath California may have been inhabited continuously for over a thousand or more years. The Telosians, etc. are allegedly aware of conditions on the surface of the earth, which they monitor constantly via TV, radio, etc., although they are usually reticent of establishing any major contact with the surface world and carry on their activities in privacy. They are apparently aware of the geological trends which are leading this planet to an eventual crisis point (ie. ozone destruction, pollution, seismic disaster, potential polar reversal, greenhouse effect, etc.) but seem to be just as helpless to do anything to stop it as are the surface governments of the earth. All this might sound like the most daring science fiction, but there are several sources who swear it's true. More on these two groups (the Telosians and Aghartians) will be revealed later on and we will leave it to the reader to decide how to deal with such allegations. There are other groups which may have been confused with the Telosian. One we will refer to as the 'Nordics' who have allegedly established bases or communities beyond the earth. Another group which may fit into the scenario will be referred by us as the 'Aryans', an alleged 'pure-bred' race of neo-Nazis who are believed to occupy underground bases below Antarctica and utilize Nazi 'aerial disk' technology. There is still another group which we should include here. There have been some accounts concerning so-called \"nordics\" or \"blondes\" or \"Aryans\" connection with the sauroids or the serpent race. The serpent races have apparently convinced a relatively few from one or more of these human 'races' just mentioned, to work with them, perhaps enticing them with certain promises of supernatural or technological advancement. For instance if a person sees a \"Nordic Blond\" human with a group of reptilians, as many have (These particular \"Blondes\" are usually described as exuding a type of mindless and superficial \"unconditional compassion\" from their eyes) then the human will be all the more likely to cooperate with the sauroids' attempts to implant, examine, de-sperm, de-egg, impregnate, or genetically interfere with these victims. Often the Blondes who are working WITH the reptilians are described as being simplistic, with child-like minds and lacking critical thought, as if they have abandoned all critical judgement in exchange for blind faith in the grandiose promises of the serpent race. If such a scenario involving an actual conflict between human and saurian beings is in fact taking place on, below and above this planet, then one must wonder why the majority of us humans living on the surface are oblivious to the fact? There are in fact many Christian-Patriotic publications which document actual attempts by one-world organizations to influence and manipulate the information media. If many of these one- world organizations, through secret fraternities, have actually been suppressing news references to \"reptilians\" as part of a secret-governmental cover-up, then the ignorance would be explained by the fact that the majority of human society would rather \"go with the flow\" and believe everything they're told with blind faith. Just because something is big and powerful (like the news media, and in fact like the devil himself) does not mean that they are always benevolent or truthful. From ancient times, man has been aware that there has been a power or a force which was and is intent on destroying humanity as a whole, although in many cases they have been unable to put their finger on just 'what' was behind this conspiracy to orchestrate this destruction of human society. This lack of discernment of reality on the part of humanity is one of the enemy's major strategies, since the serpent races attempt to blind and confuse the nations of the earth as to the true nature, and in fact the very existence, of their warfare-subversion-invasion-infiltration of human society."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The threat however is very real and must be treated by the \"human resistance\" as a real and potentially deadly threat. According to John Lear, William Cooper, and several other researchers the U.S. government may have made a 'pact' with a non-human race as early as 1933. According to some this 'race' is not human as we know it, yet it claims to have it's origin on earth several thousands of years ago. Some sources allege that this predatory race is of a neo-saurian nature. This has led others to suggest that the dinosaurs which ruled the surface of the earth in prehistoric times may not have become entirely extinct as is commonly believed, but that certain of the more intelligent and biped-hominoid mutations of that race developed a form of intellectual thought equal to or surpassing that of the human race, and then possibly went into hiding. For instance one branch or mutation of the supposedly extinct sauroid race, Stenonychosaurus, was according to paleontologists remarkably hominoid in appearance, being 3 1/2 to 4 1/4 ft. in height with possibly greyish-green skin and three-digit clawed fingers with a partially-opposable 'thumb'. The opposable thumb and intellectual capacity is the only thing preventing members of the animal kingdom from challenging the human race as the masters of planet earth. For instance the ape kingdom possesses opposable thumbs yet it does not possess the intellectual capacity to use them as humans do. The dolphins possess intellects nearing that of humans but do not possess opposable thumbs or even limbs necessary to invent, etc. Could their be an 'animal' which possesses both of these characteristics? The cranial capacity of Stenonychosaurus was nearly twice the size of that of human beings, indicating a large brain and possibly advanced though not necessarily benevolent intellect. According to researchers such as Brad Steiger, Val Valerian, TAL LeVesque and others this may actually be the same type of entity or entities most commonly described in 'UFO' encounters, as well as the same type of creatures depicted in early 1992 in the nationally viewed CBS presentation 'INTRUDERS'. According to Lear and others the government may have established a 'treaty' with this race, which they later learned to their horror was extremely malevolent in nature and were merely using the 'treaties' as a means to buy time while they methodically establish certain controls upon the human race, with the ultimate goal of an absolute domination. It is also alleged by certain deep-level intelligence agents that the Illuminati, or the 'Cult of the Serpent', is willfully working hand-in-claw with this infernal race which has promised them part of the action once the 'New World Order' is established. The Illuminati is allegedly in it for the power and 'technology' which this non-human race is supposed to give them in exchange for their cooperation. According to John Lear and others, many of the deep underground bases such as those below Dulce, New Mexico and Pine Gap, Australia are actually 'joint' areas where the technology exchanges have been carried out, as well as battles between the humans and 'grays' sparked by disagreements, etc. Could the Illuminati's plans for world domination be backed by an 'reptilian' vanguard? One unusual point that the following article makes is the apparent connection between the Illuminati's 'Club of Rome' and the so-called 'Greys'. One might ask themselves: If an reptilian species desired to establish control over a civilization, would they attempt an outright and immediate invasion and destruction of all resistance or would they instead attempt to manipulate situations behind the scenes in order to turn the inhabitants of the 'target' environment against each other, and decimate the population to the point that resistance would be minimal? The 'logical' choice, presuming that the 'reptilians' are heartless vermin, would be the latter, and there is much evidence that the 'Club of Rome' has 'sold out' the human race to such"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"reptilian powers in exchange for certain promises, and that this sold-out power group is carrying out an agenda of MASS GENOCIDE against the human race as a whole, in obedience to their draconian masters. If such an inhuman and reptilian race exists, then these genocidal 'policies' which the Illuminati-Club or Rome is carrying out no doubt originated from 'them'. As William Cooper has stated elsewhere, whether the 'reptilians' exist or not makes no difference, since the 'idea' of the existence of a non- human reptilian race is part and parcel of the Illuminati's one-world totalitarian plans. This has been confirmed by several researchers. With this introduction, the activities taking place at such underground installations as the Pine Gap Facility may be better understood. From Dr. Jean Francois Gille, who moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico from France, comes a translation of a French document that exposes the relationship between several factors in the matrix of world affairs. The article, titled - 'PINE GAP BASE: WORLD CONTEXT', was written by Lucien Cometta and later translated into English by Dr. John Gille: PINE GAP \"The United States has three major bases in Australia. One is in South Australia (Nurranger, near Woomera, T.N.), another in New South Wales, and the third (and by far the largest) is located within about 230 km (143 miles) of the geographical center of the continent, not far to the west of Alice Springs (Northern Territory), at the foothills of the southern slopes of the MacDonnell Range. This base is completely underground, with barely visible entrances to the surface. \"This 'Top Secret' base is entirely financed by the United States Government, and is officially known as the Joint Defense Space Research Facility. \"When the JDSRF was first initiated, its aim was scientific research for the supposed development of a space defense technology. It is now known that since its inception, its primary purpose was research into electromagnetic propulsion. \"What exactly is Pine Gap? As strange as it may seem, even Australian Federal Parliament members do not know. Among the Cabinet members, only a small number of 'initiates' have a vague idea of what this is all about. The only information source available to the public is the cross-checking done by private researchers such as Jimmy Guieu, following statements made by the United States or Australian magazines (always very short and terse paragraphs), and anything the locals may notice. \"It is said that under Pine Gap is the deepest drilling hole in Australia - about 5 miles (more than 8,000 meters). Such a hole is likely used as an underground antenna able to recharge the batteries of submarines in the Pacific and Indian Ocean through ELF broadcasts. Such a gigantic antenna could be used to generate the gigantic stationary wave around the Earth. \"Some say that Pine Gap has an enormous nuclear generator to supply energy to a new type of transceiver. It seems too that there is a high-powered, high-voltage plasma accelerator which may be put to use to transmit electric current, or even to produce a 'death-ray', or quite simply to feed a plasma gun. All this is not as incredible as it sounds: it is now known that the US base of West Cape, near Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia (Harold E. Holt USN Communication Station), has an older type of the transceiver used at Pine Gap which is used to send electric"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"current to submerged US submarines who trail a wire antenna. It is known that electric currents transmitted in this way are referred to as plasmo-dynamic cells. \"Several times, locals have seen WHITE DISKS about 30' in diameter in the process of being unloaded from large US cargo planes at the airports serving Pine Gap. Those disks had the USAF emblem on them. It seems likely that disks are assembled and based at Pine Gap. The number of disks seen at night leavesno doubt in anyone's mind. An amazing quantity of furniture has been delivered by plane from the United States. The locals also say that an enormous amount of food is stocked in warehouses of what could well be a true multi-leveled underground city. \"On the other hand, Pine Gap is well known as one of the most important control centers for spy satellites which circle the globe. An article published in late 1973 claimed that the Pine Gap installation, along with its sister installation in Guam, were used to control the photographic missions of the large American satellites in orbit above the Earth. \"Pine Gap has enormous computers which are connected to their American and Australian central counterparts, which collect all the information secured in these countries, not only about finance and technology, but on every aspect of the life of the average citizen. Those computers at Pine Gap are also evidently connected to similar mainframes in Guam, in Krugersdorp South Africa, and at the Amundsen-Scott US base at the South Pole. \"Let us say, incidentally, that the employees (more than 1200) of the US base in South Africa all claim to be members of the US consular mission in that country. It may be worthy of note that the Amundsen-Scott base at the South Pole is located on a sensitive magnetic spot of our planet, that it holds exactly the same assets as Pine Gap, and that all the information about most of the average citizens of Western Europe is stored there in memory banks tens of meters under the icepack. \"A statement made by the Australian premier about 1987, assuring that 'France must disappear from the Pacific, from the Kerguelen Ridge, and from Antarctica' sheds light on the importance of this polar base for the Anglo-Saxon world. \"The most disquieting fact about Pine Gap may be that the employees working on the base, and especially those earmarked for duty on electromagnetic propulsion projects, have undergone brainwashing and even implantation of intracranial devices. Those employees have turned into unconditional slaves of their master, whoever he is. Rather scary, isn't it? \"The true point of the brainwashing of those individuals, along with the ruthless attempts to implement the coverup of really advanced military technology, will become clear at the end of this article. \"For me, it all began with the construction of the new Parliament building in Canberra, which cost billions of dollars. Australia has only 18 million inhabitants, yet it apparently treated itself to a building far beyond its means...supposedly to accommodate its government even if the old Parliament building was perfectly fine. \"This new building, enormous, immense and magnificent would easily fit the needs of the USSR or of the United States, which both have hundreds of millions of citizens to rule. That building puzzled me, and I started to talk about it until the day I bumped into"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"an Englishman who told me that the Australian premier, Bob Hawk, was a Rhodes scholar, and as such he worked toward the setting up of a One World Government, and that this new Parliament building likely had something to do with it. \"Sometime after, I stumbled on a pamphlet published by the Human Rights Organization, which talked about a group of about a hundred people well-placed in high finance, politics, the judiciary branch and big business. This group was called the 'Club of ROME'. According to this pamphlet, the CLUB OF ROME was pledged to a consortium which controls all international finance. A number of other groups similar to the CLUB OF ROME are equally pledged to that finance consortium, AND ARE INFILTRATING THE VARIOUS POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS WITH THE INTENTION TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD THE INSTITUTION OF A WORLD DICTATORSHIP. \"The whole thing looked a little bit too preposterous to be true, it seemed to me. Nevertheless, a friend of mine gave me an audio cassette taped at a lecture given by Peter Sawyer, a former high-ranking Australian civil servant, which exposed a certain number of facts he had noticed while in office. He talked, in particular, of a telephone exchange in Canberra called 'Deacon Center'. This exchange, built in concrete with 4 (ft. ? - Branton) thick walls, cost hundreds of millions of dollars. It is outfitted with numerous computers, arrayed on four levels. When he tried to find out why such equipment was needed in a country of only 18 million, he discovered that those computers were connected to all the banks, to every post office, to all telephones, and to all of the police stations and customs houses; to every arrival and departure desk for air or sea travelers; and also and above all, to the other data centers collecting data on private citizens... in the United States as well as in Europe. \"That facility on Deacon street is therefore a Center where all the data pertaining to every citizen of the Western World end up being stored. All financial, economic, political and military information, as well as the information on every inhabitant of those countries. As a matter of course, all people living in Australia are put on file, kept up with and labeled. \"Peter Sawyer discovered also that the president of the ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION came for a lengthy stay in Australia to supervise in person the construction of 20 luxury residences in Canberra (the Australian government footed the bill), in the wonderful setting of a National Park, where, legally, nobody is allowed to build. \"The investigations lead by Sawyer exposed, first, that the new Parliament building is meant to accommodate the world government-to-be; and, second, that the 20 luxury residences will be allocated to the different foreign members of that government... Why choose Canberra as the headquarters of the new world government? Simply because Australia is a peaceful country, with very few natives likely to turn rebellious, and, above all, it's an English speaking country. No other English speaking country can offer the safety Australia will provide at the time of the taking over by the World Government. In America and Europe, uprisings are more than likely, and South America not only is not English-speaking, but its fondness for revolutions and social disturbances is well known. \"Australia is thus the ideal place for such an undertaking. How is the advent of a World Government possible in the near future? It is relatively easy, as we will explain. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"First, who are those 'internationalists' who want to take over the planet? THE ONES WHO WANT TO SET UP A WORLD GOVERNMENT ARE 15 FAMILIES OR SO, WHO ALREADY GOVERN ALL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE AND KEEP A TIGHT LEASH ON MOST GOVERNMENTS THROUGH THE ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF THEIR FINANCES AND THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMY. These finance moguls devised their plan after World War I, and have been working since on an insidious undermining process aimed at economic destabilization all over the West. \"If those financiers are obviously labeled 'capitalists', it is a very deceptive label, though, for, in fact, they never stopped to pull the strings of the progressive parties, as well as those of the conservative parties. Their idea is logical, and lay, quite simply, in the destabilization of the countries of the West on the political, economic and religious levels. IT MAY BE SURPRISING TO SOME THAT THESE 'INNOVATORS' HAD INFILTRATED THE TOP LEVELS OF THE MAIN RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENTS, ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF YEARS WAS NEEDED TO MAKE THEM VIRTUALLY POWERLESS... (Were these establishments 'bought out' through financial contributions? - Branton) \"Economic destabilization is implemented through a slower but most efficient process. This process (already under way) will cause the entire financial system of the West to collapse. The people involved are the same people who cause the price of oil to go up and then, after convincing European neighbors to agree to these price rises, provide that the yield coming from the price rises will be paid to the 'International Reserve Bank', which is entirely at their command. The Reserve Bank hands the money over to a 'holding bank' who lavishly loans the money to Third World countries for usurious rates of interest. \"The holding bank receives the interest paid by the underdeveloped countries, then puts it into another 'holding bank' which, in turn, invests the huge quantity of money on behalf of the Arabs. \"Those investments are made into thriving large businesses. In the meantime, only small interests are sent to Arab countries. \"Those who engineered the plan were perfectly aware that the leaders of the underdeveloped countries would be tempted to pocket a good part of the received money. \"I IRB will then tell the Arab countries that the holding bank investments have turned out badly, all their assets had vanished and that no interest will be paid any more. The Arab countries will then have no choice but to put all the securities they own on the market, as well as quite an amount of property bought by the second holding bank. A good part of these possessions will then be frozen, because they will have been bought with the aid of not entirely repaid loans, and they will be part of the assets of the first holding bank, gone bankrupt. The incredible quantity of shares put on the market at the same time will cause a stock market crash of such magnitude that all the national economies of the West will collapse at the same time. \"The planet will find itself in a desperate predicament. Cash will not be worth a damn, and the risks of a global confrontation (planned!) will be high. ENTER PINE GAP \"At this point, the usefulness of bases like Pine Gap will become obvious.

THE POTENTIAL ACHIEVED THROUGH THE EQUIPMENT OF THE UNDERGROUND BASES WILL MAKE POSSIBLE THE DISAPPEARANCE WITHOUT A TRACE OF THOSE WHO DO NOT CONFORM AND THOSE WHO 'HINDER THE HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE'. Also, it will ensure the swift crushing of any possible uprising.
