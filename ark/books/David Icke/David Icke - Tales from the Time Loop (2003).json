T. H. Huxley I said in my last book, Alice in Wonderland an d the World Trade Centre Disaster, that I was at the e nd o f an era in my life a nd at the start of new one. I wrote: \"Changing reality from 'I can't' to 'I can', from 'small horizon' to 'no ho rizon', is where my journey takes me now. From expo sing the c onspiracy to think ing and feeling it out of existence. As the Morpheus character says in the movie, The Matrix: ” You h ave to let all go, Neo; fear, doub t, disbelief. Free you r mind.'\" I have written some one a nd a half million words abou t the manipu lation o f the human race in this five- sense level of reality by a network o f secret societies and g roup s controlled by unseen forces that place their pupp ets in p olitical, econo mic, military and media power to advance a n agenda for a ce ntralised g lobal fascist state. It is important that we kno w this information and continue to add to the kno wledge of how w e are imprisoned by ou r 'free world'. But there is more to kno w and do : much more. I knew that for me to take the story on and und erstand the e ven greater context in which this manipu lation is unfolding, I would h ave to see into o ther dimensions of reality b eyond the 'world' that we daily experience. This is exactly what happened to me in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil in 2003 . What I learned from these journeys of the mind is the major focus of this book. Many o f those who h ave been reading my work thus far will find some of this extremely challenging as we c lose in, still further, on the nature of the human cond ition and the force that seeks to control and imprison u s in a manufactured illusion - 'the Matrix'. Born to be free What happened in the Amazon is the latest stage in a fantastic journey o f discovery, or rediscovery, that I consciously b egan in 1 990 when my life a nd p erceptions were transformed by events that at one point threatened to d estroy me., But all they were doing was s etting me free from the delusions laid out to entrap us in this prison o f the mind. I also realised that, while I only b eca me c onsciously aware of a guiding force in 1989, the journey that I continue to travel began from the moment I was born, and in fact, as we measure 'time', long b efore. Many p eople a sk me how I became involved in researching and exposing the global conspiracy. In this opening chapter I am going to summa rise the background to what happened to me. It is extremely relevant to my experiences in the Amazon and the way the information abou t the c onspiracy h as been p resented to me day after day with such synchronicity since 1990 . I was born in Leicester, England, at around 6 .15pm on April 29th 1 952. I grew up in what they call in Britain a 'working class' family. This is often another way o f saying 'skint', and in our case it certainly was. My father was Beric, the produ ct of the tough est of lives, and the biggest influence on me in those ea rly years. He was extremely sharp intellectually, but his background o f pov erty and d aily survival meant that he could n ever achieve his ambition to b e a doctor. Only those with money h ad any chance of that and my father had to leave schoo l to p rovide a n income for his family after his own father did a runn er and left them. These times left scars with h im that he c arried for the rest of his life a nd so d id his experiences in the Great Depression o f the 1930 s when on ce he walked from London to Blackpo ol, a distance of some 200 miles, looking for work du ring the manufactured 'slump' in which un employment soared while those respon sible for it added massively to their wealth. He joined the Army Medical Corps during the Second World War and won the British Empire Medal for pulling airmen ou t of a blazing plane that crash-landed at the Chipping Warden Air Base in Oxfordshire in 1943 . He a lso served in the Middle East and moved up through Italy as the fascists retreated. He was stunn ed to see Roman Catholic c hurches with un told wealth in place s like Naples s urround ed by unb elievable poverty while those in such dire need went on g iving to their merciless religion. It made him vehemently anti-religion for the rest of his life, but unfortunately h e a lso rejected any idea of life a fter 'death' because he equated that with the view of the religions he so d espised. His Naples s tories and many more that he told me, shaped my ou tlook on life from a very early age. Any expressions of unfairness, injustice a nd imposition h ave a lways pressed my bu ttons. From the start I was a rebel questioning the established o rder. My mother, Barbara, was the oppo site of my father. He was dominating and wanted to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 2 control; she went quietly along d oing whatever was necessary for her family. If you n eeded someone in a trench with you - she was among the first you should call. My earliest memory is s itting at an o ld b attered table in a dark and d ingy room. On the table was a bottle of sterilised milk, much u sed by the 'working class' of the 1950 s beca use it lasted longer than the other sort. That memory h as come flooding b ack whenever I have smelled the distinctive whiff of sterilised milk. The scene was in a tiny terraced slum of a hou se in Lead Street, just off Wharf Street, in the rundown centre of Leicester, an indu strial city in the English East Midlands. I lived in Lead Street for the first three years or so o f my life a nd the sterilised milk is all I can recall. My second memory is running for the bus when we moved to a big n ew coun cil estate on the outskirts of Leicester and the hou se where my mother and you nger brother, Paul, still live some 50 y ears on. It is right across the road from the Leicester General Hospital where I was born. Money was short, seriously short, throughout my childhood and I remember going with my mother around the back o f the Gents clock factory on 'pay d ay' Thursdays, so my father could sneak ou t and h and ov er his wages to buy that night's dinner. Money in the bank? What's a bank?? As the old joke goes, until I was 14 I though t knives and forks were jewellery. On a number of occa sions when there was a kno ck on the doo r my mother would tell me to hide und er the window or behind a c hair. There we would stay, still and q uiet, until she gave the a ll clear. I had no idea what this was all abou t until later when I realised the kno ck was the c oun cil rent man coming to collect the money we didn't have a nd, when no . one a nswered, he would walk around the hou se looking in the windows. This happened many times and it's funn y, I sometimes s till get a kno t in my stomach when there's a kno ck at the doo r. Throughou t my childhood I always felt different, although I didn't know w hy. I felt there was s omething I was here to do , but what? I was a loner and I spent hou rs, day after day, playing by myself with little metal trains on the window-sill, lost f ~ \" my o wn world. My mother has often recalled ho w I was so shy that I would cross the street to avoid speaking to p eople I knew. All these years and many pu blic professions later, I still prefer my o wn space a nd p rivacy and on ce a pub lic e vent over I just want to g et away and disappear fr om view. This has always been an apparent contradiction with me; in the pub lic e ye a s a professional socce r player, national television p resenter, politician and no w author and challenger of conv entional though t, yet all along I have been a person who d islikes 'limelight' and would p refer to b e anony mous. This is not however, a c ontradiction, as I will explain later on. I have a lways been extremely sensitive e motionally, and from the ea rliest ti me I can remember I have been scanning the whole spectrum of human emotion, often flipping from one to another very qu ickly. Again there is a reason for this, I was later to und erstand. One thing I knew from childhood is that I was not going to b e one of the c rowd. I was going to b e different and if I couldn't be different I didn't want to b e here. I wasn't going to acce pt a future based on the fact that I was '.working class' and therefore destined for a factory o r some low paid job do ing what someone e lse told me to do . I am not kno cking those who do that, far fr om it. Without such p eople a ll those things we buy in the shop s, including food, would not be there a nd I think the wages paid in these essential and hug ely und ervalued jobs is a disgrace . Keep the streets clean and they p ay you a pittance; play the casino in Wall Street or the City o f London, gambling with the very survival of millions of people, and they p ay you a fortune. So I am not demeaning those who work in factories and find themselves pawns in a dictatorial and unjust system; it is s imply that I decided early in my life that this was not going to b e for me. How I would escape from such a fate was not exactly clear, I just knew that I would. I failed the so-called Eleven-Plus exam that decided if my latter years at schoo l would b e in an elite gramm ar schoo l (for the 'brightest and the best') or a second ary modem (for all the rest). I had no interest in school, it bored me rigid, and I only went beca use I had to and it allowed me to p lay for the socce r team. I rarely d id more than average or less in exams, not least beca use I couldn't care less what grades I achieved. I really didn't give a damn abou t logarithms or algebra or binary systems or any o f the other stuff they were telling me to absorb o r believe. The only time I did well was one year at primary school when the teacher ridiculed and hu miliated me in front of the c lass and said I was basically stupid. Imm ediately after this public put-down the teac her set a spelling test, hardly my b est subject even to this day. But at the e nd o f the lesson the poo r guy h ad to somehow announ ce to the c lass that the c hild h e had just ridiculed scored h ighest in the test. I can still hear him choking. That year I came top o f the c lass in the a nnu al exams, but with a point proven to myself and the miserable teac her I went back to snoring through the rest of my time in the a ppalling school system, which is not there to educate, but to indo ctrinate. It is s o splendidly captured in that superb song by Pink Floyd -,\"Hey teac her, leave those kids alone; all in all it's just another brick in the wall.\" I was not going to be in the wall. I would h ave jumped o ff it first. The soccer player Football, or socce r as they call it in the United States, was my salvation, my escape from the net that trawled the schools of 'working class' kids and pou red them into the system's sausage machine. I was"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 3 spotted by a teacher at primary schoo l playing in the kick-abou t socce r games in the playground. He a sked me to go for a trial for the schoo l team and if he hadn't asked I wouldn't have gon e. The though t that David Icke would g et in the team never occurred to me. I though t those things happened to o thers, not me. But I was picked and my self-confidence soared. I was abou t nine or ten and no w I knew w hat my escape route would b e. I was going to b e a professional footballer. This would seem to h ave been a ridiculous ambition beca use the number of kids who make it to the professional game is an infinitesimal fraction o f those who want to b e footballers. But I was certain from the start that it was going to h appen. I would spend h ours every d ay with a football. My father would say on many o cca sions that I was never going to earn a living kicking a ball abou t and I should think abou t what I was really g oing to do when I left schoo l. I didn't consider anything else, not once. I knew I was going to b e a professional footballer and that was it. I was a goalkeeper, which suited my p ersonality p erfectly. Usually it's not easy finding kids who want to b e goalkeepers because they all want to b e outfield players scoring the goals. Often it was the lad who was the worst outfield player who go t shov ed in go al. But from the beginn ing I always wanted to b e the goalkeeper. In many ways it is a loner position, a part of the team, yes, but with a very d ifferent role a nd different skills from the other players. That instinctively appealed to me a nd so did the respon sibilit y o f being the last line of defence. If outfield players make mistakes they still have you to g et them out of troub le, but when a keeper makes an error it is invariably punished with a goal and recorded on the score sheet. I liked that sense of living on the e dge with the difference between hero and v illain so finely b alanced. I went on p laying for school teams, but by the time I was 13, just two y ears before I was to leave for the dreaded adult world, there was s till no sign that I would b e heading for a professional football club. Then, right on cue, a lucky b reak set me on my way. This has been such a feature of my life. Just when I have needed h elp to achieve something, bingo! There it is, often at a late hou r when all seems lost. In those days if you wanted to attract the attention o f the professional clubs you h ad to b e playing for you r town o r city schoo ls representative side, the best of all the schoolboy players in you r area. The big clubs didn't bother looking b elow that level beca use they figured if you were not good enough to represent you r city y ou would be of no interest to them. I was 13, a c rucial time to impress the scouts looking for the best young talent, and I was nowhere near playing in the games they were watching. By no w I was attending Crown Hills Second ary Modem schoo l in Leicester and spending most of my time staring o ut of the c lassroom window daydreaming away the boredom of the c urriculum, little of which ever registered. Then on e day the sports teac her told me he was sending me for a trial for the Leicester schoo lboy s under-14 team, but I would b e going as an ou tfield player. There was a highly-rated go alkeeper at the trial that was certain to b e selected, h ~ \" said, and it wasn't worth me trying to compete with him. This was a lad who was already p laying for the older und er-IS Leicester team and so it was taken for granted that he would play for the you nger side a lso. But 'fate', as usual in my life. was to intervene. I played ou tfield in the first trial game a nd was pretty hop eless. My h eart was not in it beca use I only wanted to b e a goalkeeper. I was asked to go and k ick- around with o ther rejected boy s while the second trial match was played. That's the end o f that, I though t. Then I heard a shou t from where the trial was continuing. \"Hey, can any o f you lads play in go al?\" bellowed the team m anager. \"Yes\", I shou ted and I ran towards him as quickly as I could b efore a nyon e e lse c ould lay claim. One of the two go alkeepers had b een injured and could no t continue a nd when I took ov er I did so well that the manager asked me to come to the next trial a week later as a reserve goalkeeper to the one so h ighly rated. That day was to change my life. In the next trial game I played as well as I ever played in my entire ca reer. The teams were seriously un even and I was bombarded with shots from every angle. It was one of those days when if I had d ived the wrong way the ball would h ave found the e nd o f my foot and b een d eflected away. It was almost as if I could no t let in a goal even if I tried. I was picked for the team abov e the lad everyon e though t-was a c ertainty. The next year I played for the Leicester und er-IS team and the professional clubs began to kno ck on my d oor. I signed for Coventry City, then in England's top d ivision, and I left school to earn my living d oing exactly what I wanted to do . I was a professional footballer, just as I knew I would always be. Awaking to a nightmare As it turned ou t, my football career was soon in trouble when I developed what they told me was rheumatoid arthritis at just 15 and a half. It started in the left knee a nd p rogressed to bo th kn ees and bo th ankles. In the years after my career ended, the pain and swelling went on to infiltrate my wrists, hands and all my fingers. For years I refused to bo w to the doctors' verdict that I should stop playing. Staggering ly when I look b ack, I continued to play succe ssfully for Coventry for four years despite the a rthritis before I was told either to stop playing o r to face life in a wheelchair. I was 19 when they g ave me that verdict, but still determined to play on . I joined another club, Hereford United, and enjoyed a year of great success before the e nd came literally ov ernight. The a rthritis was so b ad in that final year that every d aily training session was agony until the joints were warmed up . I would b e limping at the start of each session and every day I would h ave some e xcuse to h ide the c omm on cause. It would b e a blister or a stiff calf muscle or"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 4 something b eca use I knew that if the c lub kn ew the real cause they would b e look ing for a new goalkeeper. The buzz and adrenalin would g et me through the games and I was playing well, so no questions were asked. We won p romotion to a higher division, I was playing in a professional league football team at just 20 and some bigger clubs were beginning to show an interest. Then on e night I looked down at my kn ees before I got into b ed and saw that the swelling in my left knee had d isappeared for the first ti me since I was 15 was elated and though t to myself, \"Hey, I'm beating it.\" The following morning as I began to awaken in a half-sleep, I realised that I could not breathe. I tried for what seemed an age to take in air and I though t I was going to die. I tried to nudg e my wife, Linda, lying b eside me, but I was unable to move a single muscle. Sudd enly I gasped a breath and, as my body came back to life, I realised that what seemed like e very joint in my b ody was agony . I could no t move on the bed, let alone walk and, although the pain and lack o f mobilit y were to ease with the days, I was never to p lay football again. Media man I was just turned 21 , an ex-professional footballer, virtually cripp led at the time with arthritis, and, to my kno wledge, with no o ther potential skill or profession to earn my living. Happy days. In such d ire straights I did what anyon e would do : I decided I was going to b e a network television p resenter. I was interviewed on a live TV programm e a bou t the e nding o f my socce r career and I loved the a tmosphere a nd the whole ~ deal. This is for me, I thou ght, and I set my target of presenting the BBC 's Grand stand, then the biggest and b est sports s how on British television. This was apparently even more lud icrous than my ambitions to p lay soccer for a living. A least there were a round a hund red go alkeepers in p rofessional teams, but you could coun t the BBC sports presenters on on e hand. So no w this s hy gu y, who loves privacy and anon ymity, wanted to b e a national television anchorman. Bizarre on the face of it, but something just drove me on and, once a gain, I knew it was going to h appen. I was told that the way to television n ews and sport would b e by first working in n ewspapers and radio. There was an imm ediate problem, however. With no aca demic qualifications of any shape or form it was not going to b e ea sy finding a paper to take me on. Having worked in the media a nd seen it from the outside I can safely confirm that aca demic qualifications are absolutely no measure of intelligence, but that's what the system demands because e xamination p asses confirm that you h ave passed successfully through its indoctrination machine. Anyway, eventually I got a job, by 'coincidence' back in Leicester, on a weekly n ewspaper that was just abou t read by the people who wrote it. The paper was called the Leicester Advertiser and if its circulation h ad b een hu man it would h ave been on a life suppo rt machine. I got the job b eca use no on e e lse wanted it. But soon I was moving on with doo rs opening and closing to p erfection to speed me through to radio and then television. I worked as a news reporter and p resenter with BBC regional and n ational news before, in 1 982, becoming a nationally k nown anchorman with BBC Television. Sport, the very job I had targeted all those years earlier when I was told my socce r career was over. The day I first presented Grandstand I remember driving to the BBC in tears. It was nothing to do with fronting a TV show; it was achieving what I set out to do when my life a nd h ealth were in tatters. My father used to say to me that you are never finished un til you tell you rself you are finished, no matter what others may say. I would reca ll those words many times in the years to come. What he was saying, without kno wing h e was speaking a profound truth, is that we a n. create our own reality. What we believe is what will manifest in ou r experience. Later I will discuss the simple process that allows this to h appen. The 'politician' Soon after I had achieved my long-held ambition to work in television, the job lost its appeal. I found television to b e a deeply insincere world full of insecure, often shallow and sometimes vicious people. Within a few years I wanted ou t. As someone once said to me, media people ca n g et so confused they stab eac h o ther in the c hest. There were, and are, many exceptions, but they are not usually in the positions of hire a nd fire beca use to make it that far you n eed to h ave no p roblem with trampling ov er others or licking arse, often bo th. I continued to work for the BBC , in bo dy if not in spirit, for another eight years, but my real focus was now elsewhere. From childhood I had loved 'nature' and what has now been termed 'the environment'. I would ride for hou rs on my bike through the Leicestershire c oun tryside e njoying the beauty and the solitude. As the 1980 s progressed the protection o f the e nvironment beca me the ce ntre of my life. I began an environmental pressure group on the Isle of Wight, just off England's s outh coast, where I have lived for more than 20 y ears. But I realised that no matter how good you r arguments abou t an environmental issue the only thing that mattered was the number of hands in the a ir at the local coun cil meetings w!1en the vote was taken. If you d idn't have the majority supporting y our case, its s trength o r validity was irrelevant. I also b egan to und erstand that often the coun cillors' decisions on which way to vo te were being agreed at the local Freemasons' temple before the 'debate' in the c oun cil chamber had even b een heard."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 5 I decided that the e nvironment needed a voice on the c oun cil and my career, if you can call it that, in politics had b egun . What happened n ext is another example of the way some unseen force has been weaving my life e xperience. I rejected all the major political parties beca use I didn't trust any o f them. Instead, in 1 988 I wrote to the little known UK Green Party, which made the protection o f the e nvironment the ce ntre of its policies. They sent me some information that seemed to b e sensible a nd I sent off my membership fee a nd b egan to o rganise public meetings to start a branch o f the Greens on the Isle of Wight. Things began to move very fast. Within a c oup le of weeks I received a letter fr om the Green Party's regional organiser asking u s to send a representative of the new Isle of Wight branch to their next meeting. I went along and at the e nd it was announ ced that their regional representative on the national party coun cil was resigning and they n eeded no minations for his replace ment. With no one wanting the job, I said I would do it and even so two p eople voted against me! I think they b elieved that being in television was 'ung reen'. Anyway, another two weeks later I turned up at my first national coun cil meeting in a building near Regents Park in London and found it awash with n aval contemplators who could talk for England while never reaching a c onclusion. I could completely und erstand why the Green Party h ad b een such a non entity in British p olitics. Just before lunch the 'chairperson' said they were looking for party spok esmen and women, or 'Party Speakers' as ~ Greens called them, to represent the party in the media for the c oming year, and no minations would b e taken du ring the a fternoon . During lunch I was approached by a guy who said h e thou ght it would b e good to h ave someone well kno wn in the media to represent the party and would I be interested? I said, \"OK , I'll give 'it-a try.\" An hou r or so later I was elected a National Speaker for the UK G reen Party. I had b een a member for a matter of weeks.\" My appointment coincided with a surge of interest in the e nvironment, fuelled by a series of prime-time television p rogramm es high lighting the plight of rainforests and the c onsequences of pollution. By the summ er of 1989 this reac hed a peak o f public c oncern and sudd enly the UK Green Party was big n ews when we won 15 % of the national vote in elections to the European Parliament. Up to this point the party had rarely registered more than 1 %. From empty p ress conferences and empty h alls, the party, and its official speakers, were thrust onto the national news and into the political limelight. The Green Party h ad arrived, but, as it transpired, not for long. A battle e nsued b etween those in the party who wanted to b e true to its original beliefs (the 'fund is' or fund amentalists) and those who liked the succe ss and were pressing to drop p olicies they b elieved were preventing even more suppo rt (the 'realos' or realists.) I was a 'fund i-realo' in that I wanted to stick with the values, but present them to the pub lic in a much more e ffective way. I wrote a book called It Doesn't Have To Be Like This (Green Print, London, 1989 ) with this end in mind. But the infighting sickened me a nd more so when it became c lear that while the Green Party claimed to b e the 'new politics', it was just another \"version o f the old p olitics with the same old method s, manipulations and reactions. The Green Party set out to challenge the system and ended up joining it. Many times it has been reported that I was \"sacked\" by the Green Party for what was now to un fold in my life, but the truth is that I never renewed my membership b eca use the Greens were clearly no t going to change a nything. Ironically, another reason I distanced myself fr om the party in the months that followed was because some very strange things were happening to me a nd I knew that when I spok e a bou t them publicly I was going to b e in for some serious ridicule. I had reached the most pivotal po int in my life a nd what I had experienced this far was going to b e so important in what was to come. I had felt the e motional trauma of seeing my dreams of being a footballer shattered by arthritis. In pu rsuing a c ure I had b een introdu ced to the a ncient Chinese healing art of acupun cture a nd that had op ened me to an und erstanding that there is far more to the human b eing than just a phy sical body. Playing in such p ain h ad triggered a determination to ov ercome a dversity and to k eep going, no matter what the c hallenges and the odd s. Journalism had shown me how the media works and how much the 'news' is manipulated. I was able to see how the media is s tructured to confirm the official version o f events and no t to qu estion o r investigate this official reality. I could see that most journalists are some of the most uniformed, conditioned and imprisoned p eople you could ever meet. How can they report the world as it is when they h ave not got a c lue how it is? Journalism also allowed me, through the demands of newspaper space, to d evelop the a bility to write c oncisely and comm unicate to an audience spanning the whole spectrum of kno wledge on the subjects in question. My television career presented insights into that medium's manipulations, techniques and o ften unb elievable shallowness, both on the screen and o ff. The national public profile it gave me a lso ensured that I would b e widely reported when the time came for me to consciously awaken and see beyond the illusion. My time in the Green Party showed me politics from the inside a nd ho w it is a game of power not principle, no matter what the name on the doo r may b e. I saw how many p oliticians who oppo sed and cond emned eac h o ther in pu blic 'debate' were very much closer in private. My life this far had g iven me a ll that I needed for what was to come. Wake up call "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 6 I began to b e a ware of strange happenings around me from the time I was writing my environmental book, It Doesn't Have To Be Like This, in 1989 . I was writing v ery fast, often a c hapter a day, and when I read it back each evening I would k eep thinking to myself, \"Where did this come from?\" and \"I don't remember writing that line.\" It was like I was writing it all in a dream. At this s ame time I began to feel a presence around me. When I was in a room alone it felt as if someone e lse was there a nd this went on for months as I continued my work with the BBC . Eventually I was s itting on the side of the bed in a hotel room in London in early 1990 and the presence felt so strong that I said ou t loud: \"If you are there will you please c ontact me because you are driving me up the wall.\" Soon afterwards events began to accelerate. In March 1990 , I was playing socce r with my son Gareth, then aged eight, on the seafront at Ryde on the Isle of Wight and I said to him we would go for lunch at the railway station cafe nearby. The cafe was full and as we headed for an alternative someone recogn ised me from the television and b egan to ask me questions abou t socce r. When the conv ersation was over, I couldn't see Gareth, but I knew he would b e in the newspaper shop at the station looking at book s abou t steam trains in which we both h ave a n interest. And so h e was. I stood at the entrance to the shop and said to Gareth that we would go and find another cafe, but, as I turned to leave, my feet were stuck to the ground as if two magnets were a nchoring them to the floor. It was a very weird feeling, almost as if, as I now und erstand, another reality h ad manifested around me. As I stood there, my feet fixed to the spot, I heard a very clear voice in my mind say: \"Go and look at the book s on the far side.\" Shit, what was that? What the hell is going on h ere? I knew this news shop v ery well and the books in that 'far side' section were of no interest to me. They were invariably romantic fiction o f the Barbara Cartland v ariety. But given what the voice said I went over to see what would h appen, not least because that was the only direction my feet would move. I was imm ediately attracted to a book with a woman's face on the front. It was like this was the only book I could see, a feeling I have had endless times s ince. I turned it over to read the blurb and saw the word p sychic. The a uthor' was a professional psychic a nd 'hands on' healer and I though t at once of the presence I had b een feeling around me for all these months. Would this lady b e a ble to tell me what was going on? I read the book in 24 hou rs and contacted h er to make an appo intment. I said no thing abou t the presence, only that I had arthritis and I wanted to see if her healing could h elp. J was not going to say anything about what had b een h appening to me unless s he pi2ked up the story p sychically. Is anybody there? I only saw her four times and in the first two visits nothing h appened o f note, except that I talked with h er abou t other dimensions or fr equencies of existence a nd a much wider vision o f life a nd Creation. I had always rejected religion and also the a bsurd idea pedalled by 'science' that we a re all 'acc idents' of 'evolution' who cea se to exist at 'death'. Unbelievable rubbish, but that is largely still the c laim of establishment 'science' despite the wealth o f evidence a nd research, includ ing that of open-minded real scientists, which d emolishes s uch claptrap. Up to this point I had n ever really p ondered on an alternative to this nonsense, but as I talked with the psychic I was imm ediately at one with what she was saying about the multidimensional nature of reality and the a bility o f one dimension to communicate with o thers. It was as if she was te1ling me that I already kn ew - which is exactly what she was doing. We a ll know this information, but we have been cond itioned to forget who and what we really are beca use that suits the agenda of the manipulators. For those new to such ideas, some background is nece ssary. We don 't live in a 'world' so much as a frequency range; the one that our five-senses can access and p erceive a nd the five-sense range of perception is tiny. Creation is not structured like a chest of draws, one level on top o f another. It is made up o f frequencies s haring the same space in the same way that all the radio and television frequency do . Those broadcast frequencies are not just around you r body at this moment, the) are sharing the same space. This is possible beca use they are operating on a different frequency range or wavelength to you r body and eac h other. Only when the frequencies are really close do we get 'interference' and b ecome aware of another station. Apart from that all are oblivious to eac h o ther's existence because they literally operate in d ifferent frequencies, different 'realities' or 'worlds'. When you tune you r radio to a station, say Radio 1 , that's what you g et. You don 't hear Radio 2 , 3, or 4 b eca use they are not broadcasting on the wavelength to which y our radio is tuned. Move the dial from the frequency o f Radio 1 to Radio 2 and no w, obviously, you h ear Radio 2. But Radio 1 did no t cea se to b roadcast when you moved the dial from its wavelength. It goes on broadcasting - existing - while you r focus, your consciousness, is tuned to something else. This is precisely the principle on which Creation op erates, or at least the part that we a re currently experiencing. The five-senses through which we see, hear, smell, touch and taste ca n perceive a n infinitesimal fraction o f that which exists in the space you think y ou are 'seeing' now. This is why animals, like ca ts, jump around reac ting to what appears to u s to be 'empty' space. To the c ats, this s pace is not empty at all. They h ave a greater visual frequency range a nd they can see e ntities and scenes that are beyond the frequency limits of the human five-senses. When p eople say that everything is within you or, symbolically,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 7 the Kingdom of Heaven is within y ou, this is correct. All infinity is within u s beca use a ll of infinity shares all space . The point is, however, that we can't see a ll of infinity with our five-senses\" just as you canno t hear all the radio stations available by tuning to on e of them. W see only that ti ny p art of infinity that is vibrating to the frequency range of those senses - what we see, hear, touch, smell and taste. This is what I call the five-sense prison b eca use most people a re so trapped in its manufactured and manipu lated illusions that they b elieve that this is all that exists and all that they are. It is their only reality. This is further ingrained and conditioned by the 'education' system, the media a nd 'science', all of which are dominated by the belief that the 'world' of the five-senses is basically all that there is. This is what the manipulators want us to b elieve for reasons I will explore in due c ourse. When energy is vibrating slowly it appears to u s to b e 'dense' and 'solid', but look at it under a microscope a nd no matter how solid something seems to b e it is s till vibrating energy. As the speed o f vibration increases the e nergy b ecomes less and less dense until it is vibrating so q uickly that it leaves the frequency range of the five-senses and to hu man p erception 'disappears'. It has not disappeared in fact; it has s imply left the range that human senses can access. This is happening when p eople say they saw a gho st or a 'UFO' and it 'appeared' out of nowhere a nd then 'disappeared'. The cond itioned five-sense reality thinks these people must be mad b ecause such things are not possible. Oh, but they are the 'nowhere' from which such manifestations come a nd go is simply another frequency o r wavelength o f existence. Understanding all this is crucial to appreciating that the 'far out' world o f the so-called 'paranormal' is perfectly and simply explainable. The long er this book goes on the simpler it will become. On the third visit to the psychic, I was lying on the c ouch du ring the healing session when I felt like a spider's web on my face. I had remembered reading in h er ok that this can h appen when 'spirits' are trying to make c ontact. Funn ily enou gh I have never felt it since. I said no thing to h er, but within ten to fifteen second s she pushed h er head b ack and said: \"This is powerful; I'll have to close my eyes for this one!\" She said she was seeing a Chinese-type figure in h er mind, who said that \"Socrates is with me\". Socrates (469 - 399 BC ) was the Greek ph ilosoph er and g enius who's most famous pupil was Plato. At the age of 70, Socrates was charged by the a uthorities with h eresy and corruption o f local youth and h e ca rried ou t the death sentence himself by d rink ing h emlock. Among a library o f famous quo tes, Socrates s aid, \"Wisdom is kno wing how little we kno w.\" The 'Chinese figure' was only a projection from another dimension into the mind o f the psychic to g ive her a familiar image to focus on. The c omm unicator was consciousness from beyond the realm of the 'phy sical' body and can take a ny form it choo ses. This is what we a ll are in ou r highest form, pure c onsciousness. The 'phy sical' body is only a vehicle for that consciousness to experience these dense 'five-sense' frequencies of existence. The other-dimensional comm un icator projects thou ght into a psychic's mind and h e or she decodes that into h uman language. It is the same principle a s the radio programm es that are broadcast from ~ transmitter in wave form and d ecoded into words by the radio. An Italian p sychic will 'hear' the though t projections in Italian, an English on e in English and so on . This is how the psychic reported some of what the 'Chinese' figure had to say to and abou t me: He is a hea ler who is here to heal the Earth a nd he will be world famous. He will face e normous opposition, but we will always be there to p rotect him. He is s till a child spiritually, but he will be g iven the spiritual riches. Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they c ame from. They will be our words. Knowledge will be put into h is mind and a t other times he will be led to knowledge. He was c hosen a s a youngster for his c ourage . He ha s been tested and ha s passed a ll the tests. He was led into football learn d iscipline, but when that was learned it was time to move on . He a lso had to learn h ow to cope with d isappointment, experience a ll the e motions and h ow to ge t up and ge t on with it. The spiritual way is tough and no one makes it easy. We know he wanted u s to contact him, but the time wasn't right. He was led h ere to be contacted, not to be cured. But one day he will be completely c ured. He will always have what he n eeds [this c ould h ave been \"wants\"], but no more. In the ne xt session with the p syc hic the figure ap peared to he r again a nd these words were g iven to me: One man cannot change the world, but one man can comm unicate the message that will change the world. Don't try to do it all alone . Go h and in hand with o thers, so you can p ick each o ther up a s y ou fall. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 8 He will write five b ooks in three years.

Where you want to be , you will be. I was a BB C television p resenter introducing the sport and a national spok esman the Green Party. Yet here I was being told that I was a healer who was here to h eal the Earth and that one man canno t change the world, but one man can comm unicate the message that will change the world. Ugh? Come a gain??? On on e level it seemed so ridiculous, but something within me knew I had to go with this see where it led: What happened as a result of this unstoppable urge to walk p ath is that my life went through upheavals that were a lmost too much for my emotions to b ear. But, all these years and so much p ain later, what I was told would h appen has either happened o r is happening. The idea that I would write five books three years on subjects abou t which, at that time, I knew nothing seemed especially ridiculous. But I was to complete those book s in three years to the very n th. When I told some of the Green Party leadership abou t these e xperiences, their reac tion was just as closed-minded, ignorant and u ninformed as you would anywhere in the system the Greens were claiming to challenge. \"David is going crazy\", said the rumours that began to circulate from those I had told. Yeah, right. Welcome to the new politics! It was a very mild p recursor to what was to follow incidence would lead me to o ther psychics in this early awakening p eriod and they did no t know w hat the others had told me. Yet the themes were c onstant. There was a shadow across the world that had to b e lifted, a story that had to b e told, and I was going to tell it. Among these c omm unications were: Arduou s s eeking is not nece ssary. The path is already mapped ou t. You o nly h ave to follow the c lues ... We are guiding you along a set path. You are learning acc ording to ou r teac hing o f you . It was all organised, before you incarnated. True love does not always give the rece iver what it would like to rece ive, but it will always give that which is best for it. So welcome e verything you rece ive whether you like it or not. Pond er on anything y ou do no t like a nd see if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then b e very much easier. He is a solidifier of thou ght who h elps the Word to surface in p eople he meets. So you are being asked to change. You are being asked to change in a total way. It is not a matter of small changes, of a little thing h ere, a little thing there. You are really b eing asked to turn [you rself] inside out. There is a massive shadow w hich must be c leared and it is up to Light Workers s uch as you rself to focus ... on that challenge. Those of you who are in the forefront of this, you are rather like a snowplough . You are the thin end o f the wedge. You really h ave, how shall I put this? To a c ertain extent, I suppo se, you h ave the shitty end o f the job. You h ave got to do an awful lot, but nevertheless you are ca pable of doing an awful lot. That is why you h ave c hosen to come, that is what you are here for, to really shov el some shit, and therefore make some space behind you to make it easier for the others. The theme of great uph eavals and a transformation o f human consciousness was another constant one a nd it continues to this day as I und erstand more a nd more of its nature and see the effect it is having on increasingly v ast numbers of people. I was told that we had b een trapped in a \"freeze vibration\" and that this low vibrational 'solidity' was being transformed. I learned much later that many ancient traditions s ay that the 'phy sical world' was once far more fluid and less dense than we e xperience today and the a borigines in Australia say the Earth is destined to return to this higher vibrational state they call 'Dream time'. We a re certainly in the midst of enormous change that will set this 'world' free of its s ubservience, ignorance a nd density (in every sense). Bye, bye Beeb Within a few w eeks of that first contact through the psychic healer, the BBC , or the 'Beeb' as it is kno wn, told me they were not renewing my contract and, in effect, I was fired. This was a shock g iven all the letters I had received from BBC staff comm ending my work and the fact that I was s till very y oung to b e doing the job and should h ave had d eca des ahead o f me. The main reason was clearly pressure from the BB C"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 9 hierarchy to g et f1d o f me because of my Green Party activities and especially my refusal to p ay the Poll Tax introduced du ring the dictatorial reign o f Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. It demanded that rich and poo r pay the same, a blatant injustice, and I was one of millions who withheld p ayment in p rotest at its unfairness. These millions eventually h ad to appear in court and there was enormous media interest when the first cases were heard. Now fate stepped in again. The first cases could h ave reac hed court anywhere in the United Kingdom, but where did it happen? At Newport, the little market town o f the Isle of Wight, where my case was among those on the list. I arrived at the court to a blur of television cameras and newspaper reporters and pho tographers as they came to record the first Poll Tax p rotestors being prosecuted. Except that they weren't, it was to turn ou t. I waited for hou rs as row after row of protestors were dealt with for their refusal (often inability) to p ay. They couldn't deal with them ind ividually b eca use there were so many. Then, at last, I was called and stood b efore the magistrates with six o r seven o thers to face the c harges. But one in the group, a guy I had met at Poll Tax p rotest meetings, put his hand in the a ir and asked a question. He pointed ou t the date by which the payments s hould h ave been made a nd the date on which the summ onses were sent out to non -payers ordering them to appear in court. He then revealed that, acc ording to the law, the period b etween the two d ates was too short and the prosecutions happening that day were illegal. The a tmosphere in the c ourt changed imm ediately and the magistrates adjourned for discussions. When they returned around h alf an hou r later they h ad to announ ce that the man was correct and all prosecutions that day were invalid and everyon e was free to go . I pointed ou t to the magistrates that it was not that simple. People had b een b rough t to court il legally and h ad lost a day's earnings and incurred transport costs as a result. What abou t the c ompensation? The a uthorities had no choice, but to agree. Loss of earnings was repaid and I was to receive a c heque for £2.50 for my bu s fare. These e vents were blazed across the television n ews and the front pages of all the newspapers and Margaret Thatcher's Poll Tax was a national joke. From this po int, with its credibilit y d emolished, it had no chance of survival and h ad to b e replace d with on e more in tune with the a bility to p ay. The next morning I arrived at the BB C to see the c orporation's head o f sport to d iscuss my 'future'. All across his table were the morning p apers recording the Poll Tax fiasco in Newport with my face on most of them. \"What I am going to say h as nothing to do with that\", he said, pointing at the papers. Mmmm . I was told b asically that I had no future a t the BB C and a few weeks later we parted company after eleven y ears with n ot even a thank-you o r a best of luck. The BB C is actually an arrogant and o ften v icious organisation that treats its s taff like cattle. But then so do most other television companies, that's the nature of the beat. The new beginning My o ld life was over, just as it was meant to b e, and while I was now out of a job with no alternative income, I felt li berated. Working in the Soulless media had b ecome a daily nightmare a nd no w I was free. I only survived these next few years financially b eca use I lived well below my income from television and had enough money in the bank to see me and my family through - just. It was a time when trusting the flow of life was a major challenge with everything I had b uilt now falling all around me a nd it was abou t to g et a whole lot worse. My then wife Linda a nd my children were, of course, even more c onfused than I was. At least I had d irectly experienced the strange happenings; they kn ew only what I had told them. And h ere was their husband and father, a well-known face on n ational television for eight years, sudd enly ou t of a job, talking abou t weird events and ideas and soon to b e publicly ridiculed on a scale rarely seen in all British media history. The fact that they stood by me a nd d id not once waver in their support no matter happened, was one of the key factors in my ability to survive what was abou t to un fold. So it was with my television agent, Paul Vaugh an, who n ever ceased to suppo rt me e ven when it would h ave been much easier for him to walk away. My o nly d esire was to follow the rapidly changing course of my life. Strange it all may h ave been, but there was a force within me that knew this was the way I had to go . Through the latter months of 1990 I wrote my first book abou t these e vents, Truth Vibrations. When it went to the printers just before the Christmas of 199 0, the sequence began that led to the e xplosion in my consciousness that changed almost everything I had ever though t or believed. I sudd enly h ad a tremendou s urge to go to Peru, although I had no idea where this came from. I knew nothing abou t Peru and h ad n ever even though t abou t the place until now. In this same period I kept seeing the word 'Peru' everywhere, on book s, in n ewspapers and in travel agent windows. I met another psychic lady who said without any p rompting from m e: \"Have you ever though t abou t visiting Peru?\" She said I would b e going there a nd \"drinking o f the ~ Q1.y waters\". This comm ent came back to me a few w eeks later when I was drinking water fr om the Urubamba River, the 'holy river', which flows through the Sacred Valley o f Incas near Peru's ancient and formerly 'lost' city o f Machu Picchu. Everything I was doing since I had those first comm unications through the psychic was based pu rely on intuition. I didn't kno w w hy I was going to Peru, for instance, only that ~ had to for some reason. My h ead,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 10 my 'log ic', told me that I should no t be spending money I could no t afford to make such an expensive trip, but by no w my h ead was no match for my 'heart', from where our intuitive 'kno wing' communicates with u s. I don 't mean the phy sical heart, but the spiritual one that can b e felt in the ce ntre of the c hest. It is a vortex o r \"charka\" (meaning 'wheel of light') that conn ects the 'phy sical' level with ou r higher consciousness beyond the five-senses. This is the true origin to why the physical heart is used today to symbolise love. It comes from a lost und erstanding of what the 'heart' really means in this context. When you feel great love or compassion notice how you feel it in the ce ntre of the chest - that's the heart charka or vortex through which we a lso feel our intuitive 'kno wing'. When someone is trying to make a decision we say: \"What does you r heart tell you ?\" or \"Does it feel right?\" The heart chakra is our conn ection to ou r higher consciousness beyond this 'world' while our 'head', our conditioned mind, is caugh t in the trap o f 'think ing' in acc ordance with the rules and regulations of the five-sense reality. Most people a re imprisoned by their 'head', which is indoctrinated to b elieve the official version o f what is right and wrong, moral and imm oral, sane a nd insane: the 'norms' of society. This is an expression o f the Earth-bound consciousness, the 'lower' or 'five-sense' mind, that is daily manipu lated to accept a version o f reality and possibility that suits the a genda of those in control. It is based on limitation, rules and regulations and the \"I can't\", \"you can't\", mentality. It sees why something canno t be don e or shouldn't be don e a nd rarely why it can o r shou ld. It is also frozen by fear and this ho lds humanity in a mental and emotional prison cell. The 'heart', the intuition, however, is our conn ection with the Infinite self beyond the five-senses. The 'heart' feels rather than thinks and it has 'kno wing' rather than second -hand 'kno wledge' gleaned from the indo ctrination machine. Most people have an inner 'war' going on b etween what they think and feel- what their head tells them to do and what they intuitively feel to do . Almost every time the head is the winner. It is easier that way, or appears to be, in a society found ed on the imposition o f thought and b elief. Once the 'norms' of society are decided and imposed by the system through 'education', 'science', the media a nd so on , any rebels or fr eethinkers are subjected to ridicule or cond emnation (in my case both) for the c rime of being different or challeng ing this lud icrously limited v ersion o f reality and po ssibilit y. This process is captured superbly by a Japanese saying: \"Don't be the nail that stands out abov e the rest because that's the first one to g et hit.\" Anyon e who seriously follows their intuitive 'kno wing' rather than their indo ctrinated, fearful, head/mind is going to face the ridicule a nd cond emnation o f the psycholog ical fascists. These a re not only p eople in jackbo ots with silly moustaches; they are our parents, 'friends', colleagues at work, and, if you are ~ the public e ye, 'journalists' and the public in g eneral. Anyon e, in fact, who makes it difficult or unpleasant to b e different. Most of the human race is s o u tterly indoctrinated by the e xternally implanted 'norms' that bombard their mind from cradle to g rave that they h ave no comprehension that their 'normal' think ing their own ind ividual and collective prison. Such is their bewilderment they no t only contribute minute by minute to the building o f their prison, they d efend it ferociously from anyone who qu estions or challenges the found ations and assumptions on which it stands. It is what I term the \"flat Earth mentality\". When the norm was that the Earth was flat anyon e who claimed it was round was subjected to ridicule a nd cond emnation, even imprisonment and d eath. When the norm changed with the deluge of evidence to accept the Earth was a sphere, the roles immediately reversed and anyon e who claimed it was flat then go t the treatment. Norms rule, OK ? Set the norms and you control human p erception and b ehaviour. This is why expo sing no rms for the non sense they are is s o important. Those who live life through their intuition always attract the a ttention o f the Thought Police beca use the 'head' and the 'heart', the lower 'mind' and the higher consciousness, view reality from a completely different point of observation. I will get into this in d etail later, but symbo lically you could put it li ke this: if the 'five- sense' mind was s ailing do wn a river it could on ly see a s far as the next bend. But the higher consciousness comm unicating through the intuition would see the whole' river fr om source to sea. It would kno w w hat was coming and the most effective c ourse of action at any g iven p oint. It would know if there was bad weather ahead and if it was best to stop where you are until it passes. It would kno w if you were heading for a massive waterfall or if there were bandits lurking do wnstream and it could gu ide you to avoid them. None of this is available to the five-sense mind b eca use it has such a limited vision and ability to see beyond its perceived 'norms'. \"There is no evidence that there a re waterfalls or rapids in this river\", it might say, \"and until I see the proof we are going oooooh... aaaaaaahhhhh .\" The five-sense mind disconn ected from its higher consciousness is engaged in a c onstant and furious battle with the intuition b eca use if it surrendered its reality to the higher one it would lose its perceived po wer over events and b ehaviour. If someone on the boat said their intuition told them there were bandits around the c omer, the lower minds of the others would ask them for the 'proof'. They would b e told no t to b e so stupid and to stop spoiling the trip. In the same way p eople have refused to g et on aircraft that were to crash b ecause they h ad a 'feeling' - intuition from their higher consciousness. Even if these people had told the other passengers what they felt most would have still got on the plane beca use their head would tell them the c hances of crashing were miniscule a nd, anyway, they n eeded to g et to their destination to attend a business meeting o r make a dinner date. Also, the great breakthrough s in u nderstanding, including those in science, are invariably the result of an intuition, a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 11 'gut feeling', rather than the intellect working it all out. The intuitive is the inspiration 'and the intellect only confirms it. Daring to be different When we follow our intuition we often find ourselves behaving in ways that the c ond itioned, imprisoned, lower minds of people a round u s find impossible to und erstand. Because of this they h ave to rationalise you r words and b ehaviour to themselves with claims that you are 'mad' or 'dangerous'. In fact you are merely different, viewing reality from a different point of observation. It is like that scene with Robin Williams in the 1989 movie, Dead Poets Society (Touchstone Pictures), when h e told his pup ils in the 'norm' -dominated school: \"I stand up on my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a d ifferent way. You see the world looks very different from up here ... just when you think y ou know something you h ave to look at it ano ther way. Even though it may s eem silly or 'wrong' you must try ... \" ... We a ll have a great need for acceptance, but you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though o thers may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go that's baaaaa-d.\" With p erfect timing just before my 'awakening' I had some e xperiences that led me to d ecide that if ever my mind and my intuition, my h ead and my h eart, were in conflict again I would always go with my intuition. I have never wavered from that to this day. As I was soon to find, this commitment to the intuitive ca n land you with serious challenges in a world that operates through h ead and mind. In the midst of such experiences the head is s creaming at the heart: \"1 told y ou so!! Look what happens when you don 't listen to me!!\" This is where most people pull back and return to the head, the e xperiment over. But when you stay with it and continue to follow your intuitive kno wing in the face of all the c onsequences that may follow, a wond erful, liberating, transformation b egins to manifest. The mind is judging events only by its perspective of seeing to the next bend, but your intuition is viewing the e ntire river. It kno ws that while things might seem bad at this point, the e xperience is leading somewhere really positive a little downstream. This has happened to me c onstantly and n ever more so than in the opening y ears of the 1990 s. As a result of staying with my intuition no matter what, my lower or five-sense mind h as been able to ob serve 'logically' that while following your intuition can throw up enormous challenges, the e xperience a lways turns out to b e what was necessary from the bigger perspective. It sees that what seemed to b e self destruction actually leads to a positive outcome that happens, not despite the 'self-destructive' experience, but because of it. With this realisation the head/mind moves into h armony with the intuition and the war between what you think and feel comes to an end. The two b ecome the same. You follow you r intuitive 'kno wing' withou t the head symbolically b anging its fist on the table. \"Did you h ave any dreams last night?\" Purely on intuition I flew to Lima, Peru, at the start of February 1991 for the e xperience that transformed my life. I had no idea why I was going, on ly that I needed to. When I walked o ff the plane a t Lima Airport and collected my luggage, I was like a little boy lost. What now? I had a feeling to h ead for Cusco in the Andes, the centre of the ancient Inca civilisation, and I saw on the departure board that a plane was leaving for there in around 35 minutes. But the a irport was a mass of people a nd I had y et to buy a ticket. No chance of getting that flight, I thought. Then a Peruvian g uy speaking p retty good Eng lish emerged through the crowd and asked me where I was going. \"Cusco\", I said. \"You h ave hotel?\" \"No.\" \"You h ave ticket?\" ”No.” \"I get you ticket and ho tel.\" This he did in v ery q uick time, taking his commission on the way, of course. By no w the flight was close to leaving and I went to the back o f a long line waiting to check in. Again it was clearly impossible for me to make the departure time, now 20 minutes away. But as I prepared for a long wait, my fixer said: \"No, no, follow me.\" He took me down to the front of the queue where his friend was on the c heck in. The friend immediately stopped what he was doing and b egan to check me onto the flight. Considerably less than an hou r after landing in Lima I was walking b ack across the tarmac to bo ard the plane to Cusco. Such 'coincidences' were to b e c onstantly repeated for the next three a mazing weeks and, in fact, have c ontinued ever since. I arrived at my rundo wn ho tel and sat on the bed wond ering what to do n ext. Someone I had met a few days earlier had given me the telephon e number of a friend in Cusco and I made a c all to see what would h appen. She turned ou t to b e the manager of a local travel agency and within an hou r my b asic travel"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 12 plans and arrangements for the next two weeks were sorted. She a lso called a Peruvian g uide she knew who would show me a round the c oun try and the next day I arrived at his home to meet him and b egin what was to b e a n incredible a dventure. The doo r was open and I walked in to find him asleep on the floor. As he opened h is eyes his first words were not hello o r good morning, but \"did y ou h ave a ny d reams last night?\" After recovering from the surprise of his opening remarks, I said that yes I had. The dream was very v ivid and included on e of my front midd le teeth falling out. \"Is you r father or grandfather still alive?\" he a sked. \"Well yes, my father is, why?\" \"That dream is often symbolic of your father or grandfather dying.\" Making an international phone ca ll in Peru ou tside of Lima is far fr om easy, certainly then anyway, but a week later when I finally managed to ring later, I found that my father had d ied at that time back in England. His funeral had taken p lace before I even kn ew he had d ied. I was to stay long er than planned in Peru and for the next three weeks as I travelled around much o f the c oun try, a daily sequence began to repeat itself. Each morning I would tell the guide where I intuitively felt to go and h e would invariably tell me it wasn't possible. But every day we would somehow end up there. I went to some stunn ing o cca sions, not just the famous tourist sites like the extraordinary Machu Picchu, but many o ther unforgettable place s. Eventually we a rrived in a town in southern Peru called Puno , not far fr om Lake Titicac a. The guide had book ed u s in a hotel called the Sillustani, named after an ancient Inca site a bou t an hou r's drive a way. For-obvious reasons there were pictures of the place a round the hotel and I told the guide I wanted to go there. True to form he said it was not possible a t that time of year without spending a lot of money, but my intuition to go was s o strong that I said I would do whatever was necessary. I had to h ire a tourist mini-bus for myself (or so the guide told me) and o ff I went with him and the driver \"It will be over when you feel the rain\" The Sillustani ruins are located on a hill skirted on three sides by a beautiful lagoon . The a rea was uninhabited and surrounded by distant mountains. It was quiet with on ly a c ouple of children waiting with a Lama hop ing to sell photographs to tourists. But there weren't any, apart from m e. After I walked around the ruins for an hou r or so und er the piercing Peruvian Sun, I went back to the tourist bus to return to Puna. I thou gh ~ the trip was over and I felt deflated and d isappointed b eca use, lovely as this place was, what I had experienced d id not begin to match the power of the intuition I had to' gC1 there. Abou t three minutes down the road I was daydreaming ou t of the windo w w hen I saw a mound to the right. It caugh t my attention and as I looked at the mound , a voice in my h ead b egan to repeat: \"Come to me, come to me, come to me.\" What? That mound is talking to me?? I asked the driver to stop the bus and said I was going to walk up the mound. \"I'll only b e a few minutes\", I said. Although I couldn't see it from the roa4, at the top o f the mound there was a c ircle of standing stones abou t waist high and they h ad clearly b een there a long time. I stood in the ce ntre of the c ircle looking b ack across to Sillustani and the moun tains way o ff in the distance. There was not a c loud in the sky and the Sun was extremely ho t, burning my face . Sudd enly, I felt my feet being pulled like magnets into the ground again. It was the same a s in the newspaper shop in Ryde, but this time it was far more powerful. My arms then reached up abov e my h ead without any conscious decision from m e. If you pu t your arms abov e you r head, slightly ou twards at abou t 45 d egrees you 'll see how they start to ache within a minute. My arms were like that for well over an hou r and I felt nothing un til it was over and then my shoulders were agony . I felt like a drill sensation in the top o f my h ead and I could feel a flow of energy go ing the other way up from the ground through my feet and ou t through the top my h ead. I heard a voice in my mind that said, \"They will be talking abou t this moment a hund red ' years from now\" and then \"It will be over when you feel the rain.\" What was that abou t rain? What bloody rain? There was not a c loud to b e seen anywhere, just a brilliant Sun in a c lear blue sky. What was happening to me? I stood there unable to move a s the e nergy increased to the point where my body was s haking as if plugged into an electrical socket. Time beca me meaningless; there was no 'time' as we perceive it, no p ast, no future, only the moment I was experiencing. I kept moving in and ou t of conscious awareness, much like you d rive a car and wond er where the last few miles have gon e. The c ar has been d riven by your subconscious while the c onscious was off in a daydream. In on e of my returns to awareness I saw there was a light grey mist over the distant mountains and a ~ I watched it got darker and d arker. My god , it was raining over there, although far\" ~ away. Soon the rain cloud s emerged from the moun tains with ridiculous s peed. I can on ly describe it as like pulling a c urtain across the sky as a straight line of cloud I loved towards me c overing the Sun. When it came c loser I was seeing faces in the c loud s, billowing like dry ice in a stage show. By no w my bo dy was s haking so fiercely from the e nergy p assing through me that I could h ardly stand. Eventually the c loud s were overhead and it began to rain. As I felt the water on my face the surges of energy stopp ed as if a switch h ad b een flicked. I staggered forward, my legs like jelly, my shoulder and arm m uscles now stiff and p ainful. It was only at this point that I noticed that the Peruvian g uide was standing n ext to the c ircle, tired o f waiting for me in the bus. If a facial expression ever said \"mad Englishman\", his was it. Energy was pou ring from m y' hands with tremendou s power and I went down to the bus to g rab a crystal in effort to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 13 diffuse some of it. I only h ad the c rystal beca use I had walked into a shop in Glastonbury, England, two weeks before and the owner had just picked it up and given it to me for fr ee. \"I think you should h ave this\", he said. My feet also continued' to bu rn and vibrate for some 24 hou rs. I could h ardly sleep that night beca use of it. The next day I arrived at an astonishing place ca lled Sun Island in Lake Titicaca , which spans the Peruvian and Bolivian, borders and is claimed to b e the highest navigable lake in the world at some 13,000 feet. According to legend, Sun Island and n earby Moon Island were the birthplace of the Sun and Moon and these bod ies took h uman form as the first Inca, Manco Capac and h is s ister-wife Mama Ocllo. There is no electricity on the island and without the visual pollution o f neon light the stars appear so close a nd in such incredible c larity. I stepped ou t of the little fishing boat and on to the shore, still trying to make sense of what had h appened to me on that mound . There I met a blond e Argentine lady who h ad b een in La Paz, Bolivia, the day b efore when she had felt strongly that she had to go to Sun Island. She a rrived o nly h alf an hou r before I did. When I shook h er hand to say h ello she wouldn't let go and, although she c ouldn't speak English, she made gestures to my h and saying something like \"What's this I can feel?\" What was s he talking abou t? What could she feel? What had h appened to me on that mound ? For sure in the weeks that followed my life a nd p erceptions went through a transformation that took me to the limits of mental and emotional survival. It was like a dam had bu rst in my consciousness. The five-sense mind was s udd enly flooded with new perceptions, thoughts and ideas and it was just too much to p rocess at once, and make a ny sense of it. \"He thinks he's Jesus\" Unfortunately for my short-term self-respect, but perfect for my long -term awakening, my b ook Truth Vibrations was pub lished in early 1991 in p recisely the period when I could h ardly tell you what plane I was on. The book and my pu blic behaviour and statements led to u nimaginable national ridicule blasted across the front pages of the newspapers and on television and radio p rogrammes galore. I could literally not walk do wn any street in Britain without being ridiculed by the people. I lived my life a t this time to the sound Of-laughter. Going into a bar? Forget it. There was uproar. I would stop at traffic lights and look across to see whole families laughing at me in the ca r along side a nd television comedians only h ad to say my n ame to trigger riotous laughter. My children were laugh ed at in the street and at schoo l and they were followed by tabloid journalists trying to dig the dirt. One freelance 'journalist' on the Isle of Wight was especially appalling, gleefully taking money from the tabloids to do their dirty work while c laiming to b e my 'friend'. The hysteria reached its peak when I appeared on a live prime-time television chat show hosted by Britain's then b est-kno wn TV 'personality', Terry Wogan. He has s ince said pu blicly that he regrets how he handled the interview, which was big o f him, really. But at the time he took the ridicule route. Such was the publicity in the media that the Wogan show audience were laughing within a minute or so o f me sitting down and that pretty much continued for the whole of the interview. I became famous for wearing turquo ise clothes beca use after the experience on the mound I began to want to wear only turquoise, which is a very powerful and sacred colour to many n ative a nd esoteric beliefs. Native Americans are one major example of this. Years later when I met my now great friend, Credo Mutwa, a Sanosi or shaman and the official historian o f the Zulu n ation in South Africa, he was decked from neck to toe in b rilliant turquoise. At the time I knew nothing o f esoteric meaning o f turquoise, only that I felt strong ly to wear it. Funny , some of the- media c ould no t even g et that right and many articles reported my ob session with \"purple\". The other found ation o f the ridicule was that I had suppo sed to h ave ca lled myself the Son o f God, implying that I was Jesus or something. Ironically 'Jesus' is a 'man' I have no doub t did no t exist as depicted by Christianity as I have e xplained in d etail in some of my bo oks. I used the term 'Son o f God' in the sense of being an aspect, as I und erstood it at the time, of the Infinite c onsciousness that is everything. As I have written b efore, we are like droplets of water in an o cea n o f infinite c onsciousness. We are 'individual' on on e level, but also part of the infinite whole. More than that, we are the infinite whole a s I shall later explain. I was not trying to say I had come to save the world o r anything, on ly that, like e veryon e a nd everything else in all existence, I was an aspect of the Infinite a nd no t just a phy sical 'personality'. If you call the Infinite c onsciousness 'God', I was trying to say, we a re all the symbolic 'sons' and 'daugh ters' of 'God'. Obviously my awareness of these matters has increased d ramatically since then, but that was the basis of my comm ents abou t being a 'Son o f God'. However, I was both misrepresented in the media a nd, with my mind downloading so much information following the mound in Peru, I wasn't ground ed o r 'here' enough to articulate c learly what I was trying to say and this led to even g reater misrepresentation and misund erstanding among those who ridiculed and laugh ed. All I can say to 'Jesus' is that if you are there, mate, don 't for goo dness s ake c ome back b ecause they'll bloody crucify you - Christians as mlft11 as anyon e. If you do return I would d efinitely do the c loud trick to give you rself any chance at all. Some comedians were funny rather than v indictive, though, and I recall the brilliant British comic, Jasper Carrot, saying that I couldn't be the Son o f God b eca use you 'd n ever find three wise men and v irgin in Leicester."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 14 My children were in hy sterics when h e was talking abou t me beca use it was don e with good humour and wit.\" In two minds I remember clearly b eing aware during the Wogan interview of two v ery d ifferent levels of myself, what I now kno w to h ave been the lower mind caugh t in the c onditioned illusions of this five-:-sense 'world' and my infinite c onsciousness that was observing these e vents from a very much h igher perspective of kno wing. The head/mind is the e xperiencer of this dense frequency range a nd, if the head listens to the heart, the higher consciousness is the intuitive 'guide' that observes this realm from beyond its prison walls and manipulated illusions. It is my experiencer level that dislikes the public spotlight and my higher consciousness that is totally at peac e with talking o ff the c uff f or hou rs to any nu mber of people you care to assemble. While the a udience were laughing at me on the Wogan show my five-sense mind, the illusory 'personality' called 'David Icke', was in emotional turmoil and agony. But there was another level of me I also reca ll very clearly. It was saying: \"It's OK, everything is fine, this is leading somewhere, don 't worry.\" Many times I had a major problem believing these words, I must say, but so it has proved to b e. I und erstand why p eople thou ght I had self-destructed and why, even no w w ith the gathering recognition my book s are e njoying, that the 'turquoise', 'Son o f God', period is s een as an un fortunate disaster that has made my subsequent work far more difficult in terms of public c redibility in Britain. But such p eople miss the point. This period o f unb elievable ridicule did not make my subsequent work more difficult; it made it possible. Ridiculed to freedom Here again we have the two p erspectives of the lower cond itioned mind and the higher consciousness that comm unicates through intuition and knowing. The five-sense mind can see a few paragraphs on on e page while the higher consciousness has read the book . In fact, it has written it. To do what I was to do y ears down the line I had to free myself fr om the prison that almost everyon e on the planet lives in every d ay. It is a prison that disconn ects lower mind from Infinite self and the one that daily ho lds humanity in slavery to a system created and o rchestrated by the few to this very end. It is the fear of what other people think. Most people a re not living the lives they want to lead o r speaking their own un diluted truths beca use they are frightened o f the reaction o f others - parents, teachers, 'friends' and n eighb ours if their views and lifestyle are a t odd s with the 'norms' on which this lunatic a sylum is found ed. They k eep their heads down and their mouths s hut. Don't be the nail that stands out abov e the rest because that's the first one to g et hit.\" In short, they are not living their truth o r expressing their uniqueness and d esires; they are conforming to what society and its parent, teac her, 'friend' and n eighb our Thought Police dictate should b e the limits of their lives and views. How could I write a nd talk abou t the c hallenging and o ften 'bizarre' concepts in my book s if I still cared what anyon e though t of met Impossible. I would b e e diting information, even leaving ou t great swathes altogether, beca use of my concern with what others would think. Thanks to that onslaught of ridicule in the ea rly 19 90s the prison door opened. I was going to speak my un filtered truth and if people didn't like it, well that's just too b ad. They must believe something else then, it's all the same with me. When you are faced with the level of ridicule that I endu red y ear after year, you either go under and h ave a breakdo wn, or you ditch any concern with what other people think o f you and h ave a breakthrough. You walk ou t of the sheep p en into the light of fr eedom. The ridicule may h ave been a nightmare a t the time to my insecure lower mind, but my higher consciousness knew w hy it had to h appen. It was to set me free. As that 'psychic' comm unication said in the ea rliest days of my awakening: \"True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, but it will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you receive whether you like it or not. Pond er on an ything you do not like and see if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much easier.\" So what was going on? It was many months before I began to und erstand what had h appened to me and ho w it was happening to coun tless other people a way from the pub lic glare I had experienced a monu mental 'kundalini' explosion. As I said earlier, the 'phy sical' body is conn ected to its other energy 'bod ies' beyond the five-sense domain by those spinn ing vo rtexes kno wn as 'chakras' from the a ncient Sanskrit word meaning wheels of light. We have these all over the bod y, but there a re seven main ones, as illustrated in Figu re 1. Each chakra represents a different level of being. For instance, the one in the solar plexus is the c onn ection to ou r emotional level and this is why we feel emotions like fear and worry in the belly. We ca ll it having"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 15 \"butterflies in the tumm y\" or \"getting the shits\", but really the sensation is coming from the solar plexus chakra. The c hakras inter-conn ect with the phy sical body through the e ndo crine system and the vibrational state of the c hakra a ffects the body in infinite ways. The balance point of the three lower ('phy sical') chakras and the three higher (mental and spiritual) ones is the heart chakra. It is from here that we c an b alance the phy sical and non -phy sical levels of being and this is our conn ection to ou r highest levels of intuitive kno wing. A kund alini experience is when tremendou sly po werful energy is released through the base chakra a t the bottom of the spine. This process is described by Itzhak Bentov in his boo k, Stalking the Wild Pendulum 2 \"The kundali ni, as described in yoga literature, is s aid to be an 'energy c oiled up, like a serpent, at the ba se of the spine'. When this energy is 'awakened', it enters the spine, rises up a long it, and is s een o r perceived as a luminous s erpent by the p erson ha ving the e xperience. Once it has risen into the head, the luminous rod hopefully pierces the top o f the h ead; that is, the rod-like en ergy beam is s een a s projecting through the skull pointing upward. When this happens, the pe rson is s aid to be 'illuminated'. Eventually, such a p erson may become h ighly intuitive a nd d evelop some p syc hic powers, such a s c lairvoyance, clairaudience o r hea ling abilities.\" 3"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 16 This is what happened to me. It was the c ause of my ‘dam burst’ and the process began on the mound in Peru. The kund alini exploded up through my spine, activating all the c hakras and my b rain into a higher level of contact with the ocean o f infinite c onsciousness. With that initial explosion came the a pparent chaos in my mind as I was transforming from one e nergy state to another. It was this activation that caused me to sudd enly see the world and myself in a totally different way and my mind was bombarded with information and concepts I could not process for months. I felt li ke a computer that had locked up b eca use too many k eys had been p ressed at once. This was my state on the Wogan show and pub lic ignorance of these matters led me to be labelled \"mad\". This is the normal defence respon se to anyon e who is s ign ificantly different and I was now seriously different. As Angela Monet said: \"Those who d anced were though t to b e quite insane by those who could no t hear the music.\" What they called madness was really transformation. Itzhak Bentov p oints out that the psychological symptoms of the more e xtreme kund alini experience (and mine was) \"tend to mimic schizophrenia\" and many p eople a re sent to mental institutions beca use 'modem' medicine does not und erstand what is happening. He goes on: \"It is ironic that persons in whom the evolutionary processes of Nature h ave begun to o perate more rapidly, and who can be considered a s advanced mutants of the hu man race, are institutiona lised a s s ubn ormal by their 'normal' peers. I dare to guess, on the ba sis of discussions with my psyc hiatrist-friends, that this process is not as exotic and rare a s one would like u s to be lieve, and po ssibly 25 to 30 p er cent of all institutiona lised schizoph renics belong to this c atego ry - a tremendous waste of human po tential.\" 4 Bentov says that the diagno sis of 'schizophrenia' stems from the kund alini activation o f other levels of awareness: \"The reason for this is that they h ave been catapulted suddenly into a situation in which they are functioning in more than on e reality. They can see a nd h ear things occurring in our neighbouring realities, that is the a stral or other higher realities, beca use their 'frequency respon se' has been b roadened ... The onslaught of information may b e overwhelming, and they b egin to mix and confuse two o r three realities.\" 5 I went through this process in pu blic without understanding what the hell was happening to me. When eventually the nature a nd effects of the kund alini awakening were e xplained, 'it made c omplete sense of what I had experienced, although the e motional debris around me was no less painful.

On every level there was turmoil and I said and did many things that the David Icke people thought they kn ew w ould n ever have contemplated. It was all reported across the front pages of the national newspapers and by the e nd o f this experience there was little left of my old life a nd identity. Every b ridge to the 'past' was ablaze a nd there was no go ing b ack. Not that I wanted to. A mess as my life seemed to be, something inside drove me on. I was not going to run. I knew that this was all meant to b e, but why and to what end? After abou t three months the storm in my mind b egan to subside a nd I became 'normal' once a gain. Well, on the surface I did.

I began to see beyond the movie, the c onditioned v ersion o f reality that those in po wer sell us as the 'truth'. I could see the manipulation with an increasing clarity and, as my und erstanding expanded, I could see that the world was not just a little bit different to what we had been led to b elieve. It was nothing like it. The 'world' we though t to b e real was simply a manufactured illusion. But why and by whom' or by what? In mid-1991 my feet were back on the ground , but, of course, all the pub lic a nd media remembered were the c razy d ays of my v ery pu blic transition. Once you are labelled and place d in the pigeonhole, that's it. Once 'crazy' always 'crazy', black and white, no shades of grey. The ridicule a nd laugh ter continued wherever I went and the 'normal' course of action would h ave been to k eep my h ead do wn. Instead I embarked on a speaking tour of British u niversities, aware of what my reception would b e. Did I want to go? Of course not (five-sense mind). Did I kno w it was necessary? Yes (Infinite c onsciousness). The e vents were sold ou t sometimes weeks in advance because these 'decision makers of tomorrow' came to laugh and ridicule. One night it was 15 minutes before I could start to speak b ecause of the uproar, noise a nd b eer cups thrown at the stage. I waited for this to die down and then I said: \"You think I'm m entally ill, don't you?\" \"YEEEEE SSS ,\" came the c ollective reply. \"So what does that say abou t you then? You h ave paid to ridicule someone you h ave been cond itioned to believe is mentally ill?\" You could h ear a pin d rop. It had d awned on them that their behaviour was not a statement abou t me, but abou t them. It is a revelation we would all do well to remember: what we do and say is not a reflection o f those we ridicule a nd cond emn, but of ourselves. I was heard in respectful silence for the rest of that night, apart from a small group at the back n ear the bar who continued to h eckle in the darkness. I asked for the lights to b e switched on so everyon e c ould see where the noise was coming from and I asked for a microphone to b e taken to the group so they could say what they wanted to say in the full view of the audience. You would h ave thought the mike was on fire such was the vehemence of their refusal to take it. These talks to u niversity students s howed me so much abou t myself and also the c onditioned human respon ses that imprison bo th p erpetrators and their targets. It confirmed that I had pu rged my concern with what other people thou ght of me beca use no matter how I was received I really didn't give a damn any more. What a freedom that is. I began to see what an illusion I was living in and ho w the e ntire human race , except for a few, was caugh t in a virtual reality g ame that dictated the rules. I had to smile to myself in this period whenever I was interviewed by a British TV host called Eamonn Holmes, a guy I knew from m y days in television. He c ould not get his head around why anyon e would give up a successful career in TV to do what I had don e. The fact that television was not the be all and end all of life, or that such a version o f 'succe ss' was illusory, seemed b eyond h is comprehension: \"But you could still be in television\". Yes, Eamonn , but I don 't want to b e, mate. \"But ... \" Right 'time', right 'place' Those first 'psychic' comm unications in 19 90 h ave proved to b e proph ecy indeed, not least the one a bou t \"knowledge will be put into his mind, and at other times he will be led to knowledge.\" I embarked upon a daily journey o f often staggering synchron icity in which I would meet people or have e xperiences that would continually increase my appreciation o f what was actually go ing on in the world and the nature of life itself. Alongside this have been the though ts that have sudd enly appeared in my mind about people a nd events that later are shown by h indsight or 'five-sense' research to h ave been correct. I have been gu ided with a synchronistic precision that is often b reathtaking. Without this, I could n ever have c ompiled so much information and made so many conn ections s o qu ickly. There is a force that wants to op en the mind o f humanity, that's for sure. It has certainly op ened mine a nd I am passing on what I discover to those who wish to h ear."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 18 I'll give you one e xample of the outrageous 'coincidences' that have become c omm onplace since the mound in Peru. By mid-1995 I had completed the manuscript for And The Truth S hall Set You Free in which I had mentioned q uite e xtensively the background to former US President Jimmy Carter. As the book was abou t to go to p ress I travelled to Ireland to see the brilliant show called Riverdance at the Point Theatre in Dublin. The tickets were bough t through the box o ffice like e veryon e e lse a nd I walked up the steps into the a rena to find my seat. I had a friend who worked on the show and when I reached the top o f the steps I was surprised to see her standing there. She was looking b ewildered and b emused. She said she should h ave been b ackstage, but had felt intuitively to come a nd wait for me. While she waited she had overheard a security gu ard say the \"security seats\" were row S numbers 25, 26, 27 and 28 . I could no w und erstand why she was bemused because she knew from an earlier conv ersation that the tickets for a mutual friend and me were row S 25 and 26. I was in the 'security' seats? What was going on? She a lso said that she had n ever seen these security p eople before because they were not the ones that normally worked at the theatre. I decided to go to the seats and see what happened. By no w it was only minutes to the start of the show and the a rena was packed, but when I reached row S it was empty from end to end. Spoo ky. I sat down with the mutual friend and suddenly the people in front of us began to turn around and look to the back o f the theatre. When I look ed I could see a ring o f heavies coming down the stairs s urroun ding someone a nd there were flash cameras going o ff like machine gun fire a mong the a udience. Clearly someone famous was involved h ere. This entourage then stopp ed at the far end of my empty row and the people inside the c ircle of security men b egan to walk towards me. As they go t closer I could see that it was President Jimmy Carter and h is wife who p rocee ded to sit down b eside me in the other two security seats! Unbelievable. According to the newspapers I read the next day, Carter was in Ireland to meet with the then Irish President, Mary Robinson, and h ad taken the oppo rtunity to see Riverdance. And h ere were he a nd h is wife sitting n ext to me in 'security seats' when my tickets had b een bough t in the same way as every o ther member of the audience that night and no -one a t the theatre knew who they were for. I stood up and shook Carter's hand beca use something u rged me to look into his eyes. To my astonishment, and I can on ly d escribe this from my o wn experience, it was like looking into an empty shell. It seemed to me that there was no on e home and it was a weird experience. I resisted the urge to tell him I had a book ou t soon that he might li ke to read. I sat there c ontemplating the hilarious thought that here I was s itting in security seats next to an American president I was expo sing in my b ooks while surrounded by CIA security men. I couldn't watch the show for a while beca use I was laugh ing so much. Higher consciousness, as I have e xperienced many times, has a terrific sense of humour. This is the kind o f 'coincidence' that has happened constantly since I began to follow my h eart in 19 90 and investigate what was really h appening in this world, who was really in control and to what end. When p eople a sk ho w I have compiled so such information ~ these subjects, this is how. I don 't have to look for it; it comes to me. As I was told in those ea rly d ays: .”Arduou s s eeking is not nece ssary. The path is already mapped ou t. You o nly h ave to\" follow the c lues ... We are guiding you along a set path ... It was all organised b efore you incarnated.\" This is not to say it is easy. It takes a tremendou s amoun t of work and ' commitment and some days my head could explode with all the information that needs to b e processed, assimilated and fitted together. But it is this guiding force that makes it possible to lift a veil of secrecy that is desperate to remain h idden from public view and h as managed to b e so for thou sands of years. On my p art it has been v ital that I have followed my intuition at all times beca use that is the means through which the higher consciousness 'speaks' to all of us if we a re prepared to listen. If my intuition says I must go h ere, do something o r meet a person, this is what I do. No qu estions, no consultations with the 'log ical' head, I just do it. There is always a good reason, either obviously at the time or with hindsight, for why that action was necessary. Upward and onward The big audiences that came to ridicule me in the imm ediate a ftermath o f the 'turquoise period' soon d rifted away on ce it beca me clear that there was actually no thing to laugh at when the information was explained at length. For years after that I would speak to a handful of people in small, cold, halls and leave poo rer than when I arrived b eca use income from the 'audience' rarely matched the e xpenses of the e vent. At the same time I heard people say that I was \"only do ing it for the money\". My d etermination to continue was seriously challenged in this period, I can tell you. It all seemed so po intless, but that inner 'kno wing' never left me a nd constantly assured me that all would b e well. So it has turned ou t. Even when I was earning little or no money through most of the 1990s I managed through out-of-the blue inv itations to visit more than 40 coun tries. This helped me to compile a n increasingly v ast library o f information abou t the backgroun d, methods and p ersonn el behind the global manipulation that I had b egun to see was no wacky 'theory', as portrayed by the media. At first the information was mostly abou t the manipulation o f the 'five- sense' reality - the one we daily experience. It was abou t names, dates, people a nd the secret conn ections between the a pparently un connected. Later the journey revealed to me the other-dimensional expression o f"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 19 the manipu lation and I realised that the manipu lators in physical 'bodies' are pawns of a force that most people ca nno t see with the severe limitations of the human senses. I have written a long series of book s through these years since the pub lication o f Truth Vibrations. They include Heal the World, Days of Decision, The Robo ts' Rebellion, And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I Am Me I Am Free, The Biggest Secret, Children o f the Matrix and Alice in Wonderland and the World 1i.fJ.de Center Disaster, Why the Official Story of 9/11 is a Monu mental Lie. Since the latter years of the 1990 s I have had fantastic suppo rt from a great guy called Royal Adams, who's plann ing and o rganisation h as made possible the pub lication o f many o f my b ooks against the financial odds. Especially since the pub licatiol1- of The Biggest Secret in 199 9, there has been a gathering o f interest in what I am comm unicating. My website, www .davidicke.com. attracts millions of visits a month and my talks all over the world enjoy large and rapidly-growing attendances. It is all a long way from the time I spok e a t a venue near Chicago to eight people or had to cancel events to avoid h aving to talk to myself. People a re beginning to wake up and I have almost been a barometer of this with the interest in my o wn work. One of the first things I was told abou t in 199 0, in fact the very theme of Truth Vibrations, was that a transformation, an awakening, of human consciousness was upon u s and I can no \", see this manifesting more obv iously every d ay. It is not the majority y et, but we a re getting there. Minds, or more importantly h earts, are opening to a truth that we all kno w, but have been manipulated to forget. I will now describe the multi-levels of the global and cosmic c onspiracy as they h ave been revealed to me since the mound in Peru. Firstly, I was led to the five-sense information o f how the world we see is being manipulated towards a global fascist state; this was followed with the revelations abou t the other- dimensional control of the five-sense manipulators; and then, in the Amazon rainforest in 2003, I was shown ho w and why ou r daily experience is only a dream of our own making. It was in Brazil that my mind-was opened to an even g reater appreciation o f the human plight and the a mazing transformation that is going to take us home. This kno wledge is the key to ou r fr eedom and I will go into that in considerable detail later.

Almost inevitably h e c omes to the c onclusion that the gov ernment he lives und er is 'dishonest, insane a nd intolerable. H. L. Mencken, American Writer 1880-1956 To und erstand the background to current and h istorical world events, including what happened on September 11th 20 01, I have had to research and und erstand so many subjects, some of them considered bizarre or crazy to ou r conditioned reality. As the puzzle piece s began to emerge, it beca me clear that a network o f interbreeding bloodlines going b ack to the a ncient world h as expanded its control over the human po pu lation, until today, a full-blown global dictatorship is within its s ight and within its grasp. Or at least it would b e if the a wakening o f the human heart and mind were not abou t to b low the hou se down. Unless people kno w the real background to what is happening they can easily b e dece ived by the official versions of 9/11 and o ther atrocities, wars, famine a nd strife that are daily ‘reported’ by the media. The official story o f September 11th is a monumental lie, as I reveal in Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster, but most people have believed it, and the wars of conqu est that have followed h ave been 'justified' by the official version b eing true. This has included the deaths of at least five thou sand Afghan civilians. These were men, women and children, like those who live in you r street, who were slaugh tered by US and British bombing to \"get Bin Laden\" - the man who was suppo sed to h ave organised 9 /11 from a ca ve in Afghanistan. It's a lie, but the lie was believed and, therefore, led to the reac tion that killed and maimed still more people in the name of 'peace' and 'justice'. Some idiot interviewers in the mainstream m edia have a sked me what was the point of peop le kno wing what is going on . Well, if the public realised who the true perpetrators of 9/11 really were we would no t have had ou r fr eedoms destroyed by the day since those planes hit, and thou sands of civilians in Afghanistan would still be with u s. Nor would we have had the invasion o f Ir aq with more than seven thou sand civilians killed and tens of thou sands maimed, if the people had kno wn the true background to why that happened. From Strand to web People c ome into an und erstanding abou t the global conspiracy through many different routes. Some begin to investigate the legalised corruption and theft orchestrated through the banking system and go on to see that this is just one strand o f an enormous conspiracy that pervades all areas of human life. Others come to this knowledge by researching the supp ression o f information about 'UFOs' or the c orruption o f gov ernments, arms s ales, 'Third World d ebt and the ac tions of translational corporations that lead to d eath, hung er and suffering across Africa, Central and South America a nd elsewhere. If you pu rsue a ny o f these investigations far enough , and with an op en mind, it will inevitably lead you into the e normous s pider's web of inter-conn ected and coordinated manipu lation, mass murder and corruption that is the global conspiracy. I was guided into this und erstanding by the desire to kno w w hy alternative e xplanations for life were being supp ressed while the versions presented by 'science' and religion were given free reign. When my awakening b egan to express itself I r ealised there were e xplanations that challenged those of 'science' and religion and made far more sense in solving the 'mysteries' of life. Why was this information not made available to children and students in the schoo ls and u niversities? Where were the television p rogrammes abou t these c oncepts in the mainstream m edia? Why was anyon e who talked abou t them either ridiculed by 'science' or cond emned by 'religion'? As my investigations continued a whole universe of kno wledge began to b e unleashed as I realised that the supp ression o f the very n ature of our existence was a part, a fund amental part, of a global conspiracy o f simply astonishing p roportions. I foun d myself involved in years of highly d etailed and p ainstaking research on which I would o ften spend eight hours or more a day, week after week, month after month. That's how w ell hidden the c onspiracy h as been - but not any longer. Before we move on to the specifics of current events, I will outline the basic background to the five-sense manipulation.

'Illuminated ones' "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 22 The c onspiracy to create a ce ntralised g lobal fascist state is orchestrated in the five-sense 'world' by a secret network kno wn collectively as the Illuminati or 'Illuminated on es'. They manipulate through secret societies and g roupings like the Freemasons, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar and the Jesuits. These a nd others feed carefully chosen recruits into the Illuminati and they are installed in po sitions of power throughou t the world, infesting all colours, race s, creeds and coun tries. It is not that everyon e in the secret societies is aware of the plot; t he overwhelming majority are not. The Illuminati operate like a cancer to infiltrate a nd covertly control other organisations. Most Freemasons never progress higher than the bottom three levels of degree, the so-called Blue Degrees and they don 't realise what their organisation is being used for. This was confirmed by Albert Pike, one of the most pre-eminent figures in world Freemasonry who d ied in 1891 . Among his titles were Sovereign Grand Comm ander of the Supreme Coun cil of the 33rd degree a nd Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry. In h is boo k, Morals and Dog ma written for higher- degree Freemasons, he reveals the way the lower levels are misled: \"The Blue Degrees are but the ou ter court or portico o f the Temple. Part of the symbols are d isplayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled b y false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intend ed that he shall imagine that he understands them. Their true implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princes of Masonry. \" 2 Even most of those who make it to the a pparently h ighest level, like the 33rd d egree in the Scottish Rite, can kno w relatively little unless they are 'chosen'. Only the tiny few, all from particular bloodlines and their offshoo ts, progress through the official peak o f their 'ind ividual' secret society into the Illuminati degrees abov e that. I reckon some 95% of Freemasons are not aware that these levels exist, never mind who is in them and what happens there. Illuminati operatives are manipu lated into the positions of power and influence to introduce the a genda for global domination. It is actually remarkable how few people you n eed to d irectly control in. order to dictate you r agenda through the whole system. It can b e don e if they are (a) in the key po sitions of decision-making and (b) they h ave the power to appo int those in the important positions below them. An example: you control the c hief of police who d ecides the policy and h e ca n appo int the heads of the various departments in his force. He introdu ces Illuminati policy and choo ses his major subo rdinates from secret society initiates. They, in turn, can appo int the people within their departments, and can choo se more secret society initiates for the positions below them. So it goes on. Once you h ave control of the top man in any o rganisation, the pyramid is built in his, i.e. the Illuminator’s, image. Governments are structured in the same way, as are 'security' organisations like the FBI, CIA, British Intelligence a nd those who control the Pentagon . The need for centralisation is obv ious. If there are only a relatively few manipulators compared with the target popu lation , they h ave to centralise decision making affecting the lives and choices of the many. The more diverse the decision making, the less control the few are going to h ave over what is decided. It is like a guy on a stage with lots of plates s pinning on sticks. Eventually h e is going to lose c ontrol running around from one to the other and the plates will begin to crash around him. It would b e so much easier if he only h ad 'one big plate' on 'one big stick' beca use he could k eep that going indefinitely. Diversity is , the c ontrollers' nightmare a nd they h ave sough t to centralise decision-making and increase their power. The reason that centralisation in all areas of our lives; political, econo mic, business, military and media, has progressed with a faster and faster pace is another simple e quation.

'Globalisation' and the 'war on terrorism' are the Age nda ad van cing to this end The more you centralise power the more power you h ave to centralise e ven qu icker. The Illuminati want a world government, army, central bank and currency that will dictate to a microchipped population (Figu re 2). The world gov ernment would make a ll the major decisions politically, financially and militarily and enforce their introduction in every coun try. We a re now w itnessing the formation o f this s tructure through the United States dictatorship. This is officially h eaded by George W. Bush, but it is really controlled by the Illuminati hierarchy. America is their major vehicle for global conqu est, as it was always planned to b e. The war on terrorism' is a manufactured excuse to take over any coun try they can d emonise through their truly pathetic mainstream m edia. The Left in p olitics, which h as long ridiculed and even cond emned what I say abou t the c onspiracy, has now discovered the brutal policy o f 'globalisation'. This involves bringing down trade barriers to allow the Illuminati multinationals to p roduce their produ cts for pennies in the poo rest coun tries by p aying the e mployees pov erty wages, and then shipp ing them to the rich West (rich for some) and selling them at a vast, obscene profit. The Left limit their explanations of this to simply g reedy giant corporations wanting more power and money. I und erstand this limitation o f vision b eca use the Left, too, are ca ugh t in the system's game while believing they are rebelling against it . But globalisation is really an expression o f the Illuminati agenda for the global state in which everything will be dictated by the few at the ce ntre a nd any d issenter coun tries will get the treatment of Afghanistan, Iraq and o thers as the fodd er troop s are sent in to 'liberate' them. Blood brothers The Illuminati can b e traced b ack thou sands of years to Sumer, Babylon, Egypt and still further into what we ca ll pre-history. Through the ce nturies they h ave been working constantly to centralise global power and complete their 'Great Work' global dictatorship. Behind the a pparent rando mness of world events has been the Illuminati secret network that is privy to k nowledge the rest of the people never hear abou t. The network is controlled by ancient interbreeding bloodlines and their offshoo ts headed today by some thirteen 'elite families', which are structured in a DNA hierarchy. These include the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, House of Lorraine, Habsburgs and the Thurn und Taxis dyn asty from Bergamo, Italy, which expanded into Belgium, Bavaria a nd wider a field. The Thurn u nd Taxis bloodline is highly sign ificant to the Illuminati although no t mentioned by researchers as often as some of the others. The bloodlines are often referred to as the Black Nobilit y. These families that control the system that controls the people have a different DNA to the rest of the pop ulation. The DNA is the blueprint for our phy sical traits and much more. Contacts who h ave experienced some of the inner levels of the c onspiracy h ave described this to me a s a DNA 'corruption'. This 'corruption' will be barely, if at all, perceptible a t the level of DNA kno wledge currently available beca use, frankly, human science kno ws damn all abou t DNA compared with what there-is to kno w. It is this DN A difference that led to the a ge-old claims by 'royal' bloodlines around the world o f their 'Divine right to rule'\" This 'Divine right' is s imply the right to rule by DNA . We have a head o f state in Britain to this day who is only there because of her DNA and the whole freeloading hierarchy o f the royal family is s tructured acc ording to a person's DNA relationship to the king o r queen. It is all based on their genetics and this is written into the law of the land that also cond emns racism and makes it a c riminal offence!!! But what is royal rule by DNA if not outrageous racial and g enetic e litism? This 'Divine' right to rule has nothing to do with the 'Divine' and everything to do with the real origin o f these bloodlines. They claim to d escend from the 'god s' of the ancient world and who o r what these 'god s' were and are, I will explain in d etail later. The 'royal' families have interbred incessantly with eac h o ther since a ncient times beca use they are seeking to retain the DNA corruption that can apparently b e quickly diluted by b reeding o utside of itself. How interesting that the families of the Illuminati and the power elite do the same to this day. Why? They are the same bloodlines. The royal 'Divine' bloodlines of ancient Sumer and Babylon (now Iraq), Egyp t, the Indu s Valley and elsewhere e xpanded into Europe to b ecome the royal and aristocratic families that ruled that continent and most of the world through the British Empire a nd those of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and so on . As the people began to challenge a nd reject the open d ictatorship o f royal rule the bloodlines began to move 'und erground' by op erating among the pop ulation in all the a reas that control modern society. Some researchers talk o f one 'royal' blood line originating from one place - often ancient Egyp t. I don 't agree with that. Egyp t is enormously important to the Illuminati blood lines for sure, but they were seeded in many parts of the world. They h ave travelled in all directions and b een cross-matched with o ther expressions of the original source. Egyp t, Sumer, Babylon, Asia a nd China a re comm on themes for the major Illuminati bloodlines and they do no t relate to on e Earth race. Instead, they h ave impregnated many n ations to advance their power and the main carrier of the 'Illuminati' DNA is the female line. History h as concentrated on the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 24 male line when it is the female, 'the Godd ess' in Illuminati parlance, which h as carried it through the centuries in the so-called mitochondrial DNA . His Roya l Hi ghness, Mr President These a ncient Illuminati blood lines have since become the presidents of the United States, the prime ministers, the leading b anking and bu siness families, the media owners and those who control the milit ary. Look at the US presidents as an example. There are more than 280 million p eople in the United States today and many hund reds of milli ons more have lived there since the leading Freemason George Washington was inaugurated as the first President in 1789 . The American n ation was also formed from a vastly d iverse genetic pool from across the world. If it really is the Land o f the Free a nd if, as is claimed, anyon e really can b ecome the president, you would fairly expect that the 43 p residents from George Washington to George W. Bush would express that genetic diversity. You're having a laugh. The presidents of the United States are as much a royal dyn asty as anything in Europe, from whence their bloodlines came. Of those 43 presidents s o far, 34 alone go b ack g enetically to Charlemagne (742 -814), an Illuminati blood line a nd the most famous monarch o f what we now call France. He was leader of the Franks, after whom we get the name France, and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, an Illuminati operation that controlled Europe for centuries. Burke's Peerage, the blue blood 'bible' of royal and aristocratic genealogy, is one of many genealogical sources to h ave highlighted the royal conn ections of US presidents. In the 1996 p residential election campaign involving Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Burke's Peerage revealed that the ca ndidate with the most royal genes had won every single presidential election in US history. Clinton's victory ov er Dole and the illegal election o f George W. Bush ov er Al Gore in 2000 h ave c ontinued this s equence. Burkes Peerage confirmed in a Reuters report on October 17th 2000 that Bush and Gore had an \"unusual\" number of royal conn ections with Bush the most prominently conn ected. According to the report, Bush is related to every European monarch on and o ff the throne a nd h as \"kinship\" (kingship) with every member of Britain's royal family. He is a 13th cousin o f Britain's Queen Mother, who d ied in 2 002 at the a ge of 101 , and h er daugh ter, Queen Elizabeth. Bush is a 13th cousin, once removed, of the heir to the throne Prince Charles, and h as a direct descent from Henry III and from Henry VIII's sister, Mary Tudo r, who was also the wife of Louis XI of France. Bush is further descended from Charles II of England. Harold Brook s-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said in the Reuters report: \"It is now clear that Mr Gore a nd Mr Bush h ave a n unu sually large number of royal and n ob le descents.\" After all these years of research it was far fr om unu sual to me. Brook s-Baker said there had always been a significant \"royal factor\" in p residential elections with George Washington, Thomas J efferson, Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, among o thers, all boasting blue-blood links. Bush and Gore a re e specially well conn ected, it seems. \"In po int of fact\", said Brook s-Baker, \"never in the history o f the United States have two p residential candidates been as well endo wed with royal alliances.\" Gore, a c ousin o f former President Richard Nixon, is a descendant of England's Edward I with d irect links to the Holy Roman Empire through Emperors Louis II, Charles II and Louis 1. This made him another descendant of Charlemagne a nd a c ousin o f George W. Bush. Gary Boyd Roberts is a genealogist at the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston and on e of the foremost authorities on the royal ancestry o f American p residents. He has confirmed that George W. Bush is descended from British royalty go ing as far back as the 12th century to King Henry I, the son o f William the Conqu eror. It was William who invaded Britain from France a nd won the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . Prominent on William’s s ide were members of the St Clair family, a major Illuminati bloodline, a strand of which moved to Scotland and b eca me kno wn as Sinclair with their base a t Roslyn Castle near Edinbu rgh. The St Clairs/Sinclairs were major players in the formation o f the Knights Templar secret society, one of the most influential vehicles for the Illuminati for the best part of a thou sand y ears. In o ther book s I have detailed many o ther royal and aristocratic c onn ections to the Bush family from their origins with the powerful Percy family in Eng land that changed their name to Pierce when they fled to America after their involvement in the failed 'Gunpo wder Plot' to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1 605. Both father George Bush and h is wife Barbara are from the Pierce line. The Gunpowder Plot was organised by the Jesuits, the secret society that controls the Roman Catholic Church and remains one of the most powerful expressions of the Illuminati to this day. The Bushes are also related to the a ristocratic Anglo- American Grosvenor family from which come the Dukes of Westminster. They o wn g reat swathes of the most valuable real estate in London, much o f it in the City o f London financial district, a global centre for the Illuminati. In 200 2, many y ears after I began writing abou t these blood conn ections of the Illuminati families, a genealogical website, www .Myfamily.com. revealed the blood line links between the Bush family and British royalty, the a ristocratic Spencer family o f Princess Diana, and wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, who was an o ffshoo t of the elite a ristocratic dyn asty, the Marlborough family o f Blenheim Palace"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 25 in Oxfordshire.

Credo Mutwa, the official historian o f the Zulu n ation, told me how so many b lack African leaders that were place d in po wer after the c olonial masters gave the c ontinent 'independence', came from the bloodlines of African k ings and qu eens who claimed to d escend from the same 'god s' as their white coun terparts. Hiding the secrets Official history h as been changed to h ide the fact that the world h as been controlled by the same interbreeding tribe for thou sands of years. This is never more so than with the major religions. They all have inner and ou ter levels of knowledge. The inner level carries the secrets going b ack to the a ncient Mystery schoo ls of place s like Sumer, Babylon and Egyp t. These include\" the secrets of the bloodline a nd only the c hosen few are initiated into this awareness. The outer level is where the secrets are hidden in code and allegory and sold, with a deity, to the masses as the 'truth'. The New Testament Gospel stories are based on the initiation ceremonies and esoteric secrets - including astrology and Sun worship - that were performed and comm unicated in the Mystery schoo ls. But they are presented as a literal story to fool the people. The religions, not least Christianity, Judaism and Islam (all spawned from the same source) are carriers of the secrets (inner) and controllers of the people by hiding the secrets with allegedly 'literal' stories (outer). The same basic 'Jesus' tale of the Son o f God who d ied for humanity was told around the world thousands of years before Christianity. This is related to the winter solstice or midwinter festival when the Sun is at the least powerful point in its cycle in the northern h emisphere. They said that on the solstice, our Dece mber 21/22nd , the Sun h ad 'died'. Three days later - the 25th - they said the Sun was born or born again. Thus we have a long line of Sun g ods given the 'birthday' of December 25th. The Jesus of the Gospels in a symbol of the Sun and the stories include a host of other Mystery schoo l knowledge a nd esoteric c oncepts. The theme of the open tomb o r coffin is another example of what I mean. In the a ncient Mystery schoo ls, the c hosen would lie in an op en tomb to symbolise their death and rebirth into the secrets. This is why they h ave found a tomb in the Great Pyramid at Giza, but no mummies have been d iscovered either there or in any o ther pyramid. They were not burial chambers, but place s of initiation in which the tomb / coffin- 're-birth' into the secrets - played a central part. Therefore, you find these tomb themes repeating through history in the secret societies and, in allegory form, in religious s tories and ceremonies. Long b efore Christianity they h ad a ritual in Persia in which a you ng man, apparently d ead, was restored to life. He was called the Saviour and his s ufferings were said to have e nsured the salvation o f the people. His priests would shou t \"Rejoice, O sacred initiated! Your God is risen. His death and sufferings have worked you r salvation. I the same tale was told in Egyp t about Horus, their Son o f God, and in India it was told about Krishna a thou sand y ears before Christianity. In the Gospels we have the story o f Lazarus lying in his tomb and then 'rising from the dead'. The story o f Jesus being laid d ead in his tomb and then 'rising' is the same a llegory for the initiation ceremonies in the Mystery schoo ls. It is for this reason that the tomb o r coffin ritual is performed by Freemasons and o ther secret societies to this day although it is only the very top levels of the network that kno w the real secrets and entry to that inner sanctum is by bloodline only. The blood in bloodline The bloodline families manipu late through this network o f secret societies, ultimately controlled by the Illuminati. Many o f these secret inter-conn ecting g roups are bizarre in the e xtreme a nd the infamous Skull and Bones Society is one e xample of this. This is based in a windo wless mausoleum appropriately k nown as 'The Tomb' along side Yale University at New Haven, Conn ecticut and it was the inspiration for the Skulls movies. The Bushes are related to the Tafts, who p rovided President William Howard Taft and it was his father, Alphon so Taft, and another Illuminati bloodline, William Harrison Russell, who established the Skull and Bones Society. George W. Bush and h is father are both members, as was the President's grandfather, the Hitler supporter and fund er, Prescott Bush (see And The Truth Sh all Set You Free). The Skull and Bones Society initiates 15 Yale students (bloodline) into its ranks' every y ear and they p ledge allegiance to the society abov e a ll else for the rest of their lives. When its initiates become president of the United States or enter other positions of power, their first allegiance is to the a genda of the secret society, not what is best for the people or coun try they are claiming to serve. As I write, one of the Democratic presidential candidates planning to 'oppose' the Skull and Bones initiate, George Bush, is the Skull and Bones initiate, John . Kerry. In 2000 , Ron Rosenbaum of the New York Observer and a team of others used high-tech n ight vision equipment to record a Skull and Bones initiation ceremony in the inner courtyard o f 'The Tomb'. They witnessed a robed Bonesman po sing as George W. Bush h arangu ing initiates in an \"eerily acc urate Texas drawl\" saying : \"I'm gonn a ream you like I reamed Al Gore\" and \"I'm gonn a kill you like I"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 26 killed Al Gore.\" Rosenbaum reported that the Bush sound -alike a ppeared a bit disgruntled with his role and h e c omplained: \"1 go t the power to bomb the c rap ou t of China a nd they g ive me this s tation?\" He a lso said, \"I'm the President of the motha-fuckin' USA\", sounding more a nd more like Bush, said Rosenbaum. Others were heard to shou t, \"Take that plunger out of my ass!\" and initiates hurled sexual insults at each other like \"lick my b umhole neophyte (new initiate)\" as they were forced to kn eel and k iss a skull at the feet of the initiator \"Lick my ass, neophy te!\" and \"Do y ou like my bu m, neophyte?\" were a lso h eard. Remember George W. Bush and h is father have been through these rituals. Initiates were witnessed by the New' York Observer team acting out \"the tableau o f a throat-cutting ritual murder.\" 4 One of the Patriarchs of The Order said: \"We ought to g et better blood than this fuckin' syrup, man.\" Rosenbaum writes: \"[The initiates] were forced face-to-face with a shocking tableau: ,a gu y holding what seemed like a butcher's k nife, wearing a kind of animal-skin 'barbarian' look, stood over what seemed to be a woman covered in fake b lood a nd no t much e lse. The n eophyte then approached a skull a few feet away from the knife-wielder-and-victim tableau. The neophyte knelt and kissed the skull, at which po int the gu y with the knife knelt and cut the throat of the p rone figure. (Well, pretended to cut the throat.)\" 5 The rituals are full of death imagery and the initiates are told they must 'die to the barbarian world' and b e reborn in the Elysian company o f the e lect of what they call 'The Order'. The c eremony o f 're-birth' includes lying in a c offin (of course) and revealing all your sexual secrets to you r fellow initiates. Another witness said h e had seen a figure dressed like the devil, another in a hood ed-skeleton costume a nd o thers in robes. The ritual also included the death mantra:. \"The Hangman equals death! The Devil equals death! Death equals death!\" It involved o rders for the initiates to fetch bon es, including the femur or thigh b one, and this is just one of the black magic secret societies that provide the personn el that control global events: As Rosenbaum said: \"It's an initiation ceremony that has bonded d iplomats, media moguls, ban kers and spies into a lifelong , multi-generational fellowship far more influential than an y fraternity. It was - and still remains - the heart of the h eart of the American e stablishment. \"But the relationships are first forged b y the rituals and the fact that the founders of Time Inc. and the CIA, as well as s everal Secretaries of State and National Security Advisors - the men who made the decision to drop the Hiroshima bo mb, invade the Bay of Pigs and p lunge u s into Vietnam, the Tafts, the Bund ys, the Buckleys, the Harrimans, the L ovetts all took part in this initiation ritual may have something to do with'1M real world p ower of those bond s. The un spoken understanding, the comfort level with the clandestine, the nod s and winks with which power is exercised.\" 6 If you think the Skull and Bones initiation is bizarre, you might consult some of my o ther book s. What you have just read is mild compared with o ther rituals in which these people a re invo lved. The Illuminati bloodlines have e ngaged in hu man sacrifice a nd b lood-drinking ceremonies s ince a ncient times and they still do. I am talking abou t the most famous people on the planet that you see on the news every day. When you realise what they do in these sacrifice rituals, often to children, you no longer need to ask ho w these people ca n o rder the slaugh ter of thou sands and think no thing o f it. The travelling empire The bloodlines, and the Illuminati secret society n etwork through which they manipu late, has been the force behind many o f the major Empires of history. In ancient times Sumer and Babylon were both h eadqu arters for the 'Illuminati' in the land no w called Iraq, and Egyp t was extremely important to them also. It was the acc oun ts, text~ and artefacts from Sumer and Babylon that were burned o r looted from Iraqi museums in the wake of the American and British invasion. After Babylon, the Illuminati bloodline network moved its headqu arters to Rome a nd it was during this time that we had the Roman Empire a nd the c reation o f the Roman Church o r institutionalised Christianity. The Roman Catholic Church structure' controlled by the Jesuit secret society remains at the heart of Illuminati operations. The 'operational' headqu arters moved into northern Europe a fter the fall of the Roman Empire a nd for a period it was based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This was when the Dutch b egan to bu ild their empire through the Dutch East India Company and they settled South Africa. In 1688 , William of Orange, one of the bloodlines, invaded England from the Netherlands and took the throne a s William III in 1689 . William ruled jointly with Queen Mary and then by himself after her death in 169 -l. In that year William signed the c harter that created the Bank o f England, and the global banking system began to emerge. Banking and manufactured d ebt has always been on e of the main v ehicles used by the blood lines to control humanity. From this time the bloodlines and their Illuminati secret society n etwork moved their centre of operation to London and what followed, of course, \"vas the 'great' and enormous British Empire. This was not the Empire of the 'British' in truth, but that of the Illuminati bloodlines based in Britain."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 27 This expansion o f the British and o ther European empires to all parts of the world expo rted the bloodlines to every continent, includ ing, most importantly today, North America. When the European empires began to recede a nd collapse, especially in the twentieth century, it appeared that these c olony continents, like the Americas, Africa, Asia a nd Australia, had won their 'independence'. Instead, the Illuminati bloodlines were merely exchanging op en control for the far more e ffective c overt control - manipulation o f events by the Hidden Hand that the public has no idea e xists. While these e mpires-were apparently b eing dismantled, the Illuminati left in their 'former' colonies, including the United States, the bloodline a nd the secret society n etwork through which they operate. They have c ontinued to control events in these 'former' colonies ever since, as part of a long planned agenda to impose centralised control of the planet and its people. This is designed to b e secured through the structure I have outlined - a world gov ernment, army, central bank and currency; a microchipped pop ulation conn ected to a global computer; and a society b ased on constant and total surveillance of every man, woman and child. A ridiculous conspiracy 'theory'? Well have a nother look around and you 'll see that this is happening now and n ever more blatantly than since September 11. The UK crime prevention charity Nacro says that the British g overnment and local authorities have spent some £4 b illion on surveillance in the last decade a nd involved up to three quarters of the Home Office crime prevention b udget in the late 1990 s. There a re now more than two million cameras and the British are the most watched n ation on Earth. But there has been on ly on e Home Official study into their effectiveness and that concluded they are not always the best option. They are not being installed to stop crime, but to track the people, A spok esman for campaign g roup Liberty said: \"Our Government has developed an almost obsessive desire to g ather and control more and more data on its citizens.\" 9 A stepping stone to the microchip is the identity card. These are being planned by Britain's freedom destroying Home Secretary, David Blunk ett, und er the name 'entitlement card'. Blunk ett wants every resident aged 16 and over to h ave a compulsory card. It will have a pho tograph, personal computer-readable identification, includ ing fingerprints and iris recogn ition, and a high-tech strip that allows civil servants and the police to link it into the Government’s national computer databases. Figu re 3: Pyramids of Man ipulation Hiding the real meaning o f identity with entitlement is s traight from the Orwellian Guide to the manipulation o f language. This is appropriate beca use w e are seeing un fold by the day, the very Big Brother society d escribed by George Orwell (real name Eric Blair) in his famous boo k, 1984. Orwell was well aware that the society h e described was possible, given the way the world was moving in his lifetime and the c onn ections that he had. Pyramids within pyramids The Illuminati structure ca n b e symbolised as a web o r as a pyramid in which the few at the top d ictate to the man at the bottom. The many are kept in ignorance of what is really g oing on. The pyramid structure of secret societies is mirrored in government, bank ing, business and every o ther organisation and institution. Society is s tructured like Russian d olls with on e doll inside a bigger one until the biggest doll encompasses them all. The Illuminati replace the 'dolls' with pyramids (Figure 3). Only the few at the top o f the pyramids kno w the real agenda a nd what the organisation is trying to achieve. The further you go do wn the pyramid the more people a re working for the organisation but the less they kno w abou t its real agenda. They are only aware of the individual job they do every d ay. They don 't kno w how their contribution (apparently innocent"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 28 in isolation) conn ects with those of other employees in o ther areas of the c ompany gov ernment or whatever. They are 'compartmentalised' and the only people who kno w how it all fits together are the very few sitting at the top - the bloodline families and their lackeys. The smaller pyramids, like the local branch o f a bank, fit into bigger and b igger pyramids, until eventually you h ave the pyramid that encompasses all of the banks. It is the same with the translational corporations, political parties, secret societies, media e mpires and the military. If you go high enough in this s tructure a ll the translational corporations (like the oil cartel), major political parties, secret societies, media e mpires and the military (via NA TO, for instance), are c ontrolled by the same families who sit atop the biggest pyramids. In the e nd there is a global pyramid that includes all the others, the biggest' doll' if you like. At the ca pstone of this you will find the most elite of the Illuminati, the 'purest' of their blood lines. In this way, they can coordinate through apparently un connected, even 'oppo sing' areas of society, the same policies. All roads lead eventually to them - everything from the food we ea t; the water we drink; the 'medical care' we receive, including v acc ines; the 'news' we watch, hear and read; the 'entertainment' we a re given; the gov ernments that dictate to u s; the military that enforces the will of the gov ernments; and the drug-runn ing network aimed at destroying young p eople. The same families and their gofers control all of these a reas and much more. This pyramid structure is how they h ave manipu lated the e xplosion o f centralisation in every area of life, government, finance, business, media a nd military. It is not by acc ident or natural occurrence, but by coldly calculated d esign. The outstanding Australian journalist John Pilger produced a rare and excellent expo se of globalisation for British Independent Television in July 2 001 in which h e pointed ou t that just 200 corporations are now respon sible for a quarter of the world's econo mic ac tivity. But there is another level to this that we urgently n eed to und erstand. This pyramid system m eans that those '200 ' corporations are, in effect, one Corporation controlled by the same force. Globalisation is not just a group o f greedy corporations s eeking to maximise profit, it is far bigger than that. A perfect example of the Illuminati's compartmentalised py ramids was the infamous Freemasonry lodge in Rome ca lled Propaganda Masonica Due or P-2. It was officially h eaded by the Mussolini fascist. Licio Gelli, who was a close c onfidant and financial advisor to the Argentina dictator, Juan Peron, and was inv ited to the inaugu rations of Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Gelli called himself a friend of father George Bush, but then h e was sure to b e an associate of Bush g iven that he was a fascist orchestrating terror and murder. When Gelli's premises were raided by p olice in March 1981 , they discovered 962 n ames on the P2 membership lists in his office safe a nd a suitcase. There were three ca binet ministers and 40 o ther MPs, 43 g enerals, eight admirals and hu ndreds of civil servants and d iplomats, heads of the security services, the c hiefs of police in Italy's four biggest cities, indu strialists, TV stars and 24 journalists. P-2 also h ad a powerful foreign membership, includ ing one of the most active Illuminati operatives of the last 40 y ears, Henry Kissinger, the US S ecretary o f State a nd war criminal. The CIA and Nazi International were also closely conn ected to P-2 (see And The Truth Sha ll Set You Free for more background ). Like the Illuminati structure in every coun try, P-2 was a state within a state. The names of the P-2 members were only k nown to Gelli and his closest associates. Not even the other members knew all of the others. Gelli divided the membership into two divisions and then sub-divided them into a series of smaller group s. Only the leaders of these group s knew w ho their members were a nd they d id not kno w the members of the other group s. P-2 members were c ontrolled by the terror of kno wing the horrific penalties of not doing as they were told. In this way, different Illuminati members and stoog es can p laya part in events like 9/11 without kno wing how their contribution conn ected with those of other compartrmentalised p eople like themselves. Once the deed is don e a nd they realise what has occurred they are too frightened to say anything b eca use they kno w the c onsequences. Incidentally, Silyio Berlusconi, the c rook, media tycoon and current Prime Minister of Italy, was a member of P_2. 12 His friendship and 'meeting o f minds' with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is, therefore, no surprise a t all to me. Manipu lating the herd Most people find it impossible to accept that a few people ca n manipu late the billions and op erate through all institutions and coun tries. I und erstand that; but once you h ave the pyramids in place a nd you k now how to condition the mind and reality o f the pop ulation, it is relatively straightforward. When a few people wish to control and direct a mass of humanity, there are ce rtain structures that have to b e in p lace . These a re the same whether you are seeking to manipu late a n individual, family, tribe, town, coun try, continent or planet. First you h aw to impose the 'norms', what are considered right and wrong, possible or impossible, sane or insane, good and b ad. Most of the people will follow those 'norms' withou t question b eca use of the baa-baa, herd mentality that has prevailed within the c ollective human mind for at least thou sands of years. Second , you h ave to make life very un pleasant for those few w ho challenge you r imposed 'norms'. The 'norms', or 'consensus reality', are e ssential to our control and, when I get to the main focus of this book a little later, this will be e ven more obv ious and p lace d in an even g reater context."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 29 The most effective way to do this in o rder to ensure c ompliance with these norms, is to make it difficult to b e different. You make those who vo ice a different view, version o f 'truth' and lifestyle, stand ou t li ke a black sheep in the human h erd. You h ave a lready cond itioned the herd to accept you r norms as its reality and, through arrogance a nd igno rance, they ridicule or cond emn those with a different spin on life. This pressurises the black sheep to conform and selves as a warning to those others in the herd who are a lso thinking o f breaking away o r challenging the prevailing reality. As I outlined earlier, this fear of being different and v oicing a view that challenges the 'norms' is overwhelming ly the fear of what other people will think o f us. In reality, the fear of what the sheep around u s will say and do if we seek to leave the herd and qu estion its conditioned assumptions. This mentality means that the masses are policing themselves and keeping eac h o ther in line. The sheep b ecome the sheepdog for the rest of the herd. This is nothing less than psychological fascism - the Though t Police with agents in every ho me, everywhere. They are a gents s o deeply conditioned that most have no idea they are unp aid mind-controllers. \"I'm just doing what's right for my children\", I hear them say. No, what you h ave been p rogramm ed to b elieve is right for them and the belief, also, that only you k now best. This is all part of the divide a nd rule strategy so v ital to the few controlling the many. Everyon e plays a part in everyon e e lse's mental, emotional and physical imprisonment. All the c ontrollers have to do is s et the 'norms', pull the right strings at the right time a nd make their human pupp ets dance to the a ppropriate tune. This they do by dictating what is taugh t in what we barely call 'education' and controlling what passes for 'news' through the Illuminati media. In this way they can d ictate to the unthinking, unqu estioning h erd what it shou ld b elieve a bou t itself, other people, life, history and current events. Once you set the 'norms' there is no n eed to control every journalist or reporter or gov ernment official. The media a nd the institutions take their 'truth' from those same 'norms' and o fficial statements, and ridicule a nd cond emn by reflex action anyon e who o ffers another vision o f reality'. Sheeple wars The self-policing o f the human h erd go es far deeper than p eople in u niform or administrators of gov ernment. It starts with conditioned p arents who impose their conditioning on their children and p ressure them to follow their religious, political, econo mic a nd cultural norms. One extreme e xample is those who insist that their offspring succumb to arranged marriages because of the rules of their lud icrous religion. There a re the c hildren o f Jehov ah's Witnesses who h ave been denied lifesaving blood transfusions beca use their brain-dead p arents insist on conducting every aspect of tl1eir lives acc ording to the c ontradictory dictates of a book pu rveying so many stories of pure fantasy. The c reation o f the mental and emotional sheep p en o f norms that imprisons 99% of humanity goes on minute by minute in subtle a nd less s ubtle ways. There are c hildren o f Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu p arents who don 't accept the religion, but still follow it beca use they don 't want to up set their family. The sheep are keeping the other sheep in line and making life unpleasant for anyon e who tries to escape. It is easy for a small group o f interbreeding family bloodlines to control the lives (the minds) of billi ons, once the major institutions of 'information' are in place , as they h ave been for thou sands of years in their various forms. There a re not enough o f these manipulators and their stoog es to control the popu lation phy sically and they h ave had to create a structure in which h umans control themselves through mental, emotional and, increasingly, physical imposition. Once you h ave the herd mentality p olicing itself, there is a third ph ase in this entrapment of human consciousness. You create factions within the herd and set them to war with eac h o ther. This is done by creating 'different' belief systems (which are not different at all) and bringing them into conflict. These belief systems are kno wn as religions, political parties, econo mic theories and \"isms\" of endless variety. These beliefs are perceived as 'oppo sites' when, as I pointed ou t in my bo ok, I Am Me, I Am Free, they are Oppo si7!1les. Look at the oppo sames in po litics. The far left, as symbolised by Josef Stalin in Russia, introduced centralised control, milit ary d ictatorship and concentration camps. The 'oppo site' of this was the far right, as s ymbolised by Adolf Hitler. What did h e impose? Centralised control, milit ary dictatorship and concentration camps. Yet these two oppo sames are set at war with each o ther amid propaganda that claimed they were oppo sites. The only difference between the Soviet Union and the so- called 'West' during the Cold War was that the Soviet Union was openly controlled by the few and the West was secretly controlled by the few. When you g et to the ca pstone of the pyramid you find they were the same few controlling bo th 'sides'. The same force operating through Wall Street and the City o f Lond on fund ed all 'sides' in the two world wars and that's provable (see And The Truth S hall Set You Free). So the method s of manipulation can b e summ arised like this: You n eed to first imprison the human mind with a rigid b elief and a fund amentally limited sense of reality - the sheep p en. It doesn't much matter what these beliefs may b e, so long as they are rigid and discourage free though t and open-minded question ing. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and all the rest each make their contribution to h uman servitude while a pparently ~~ , claiming different 'truths'."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 30 You encourage those who follow these rigid b eliefs to impose them on o thers and make life very d ifficult and unpleasant for anyon e who do es not conform. You b ring these beliefs into cont1ict to ensure the divide a nd rule you so d esperately n eed for control by the few. While the masses are busy fighting eac h o ther, and seeking to impose their beliefs and idea's on each other, they don 't see that the Illuminati have strings attached to all of them. Problem - Reaction – Solution There a re techniques of mass manipulation thi1t people need to und erstand if they are to b egin to see through the game. The main on e I have dubb ed 'problem-reaction-solution'. This has been u sed for thou sands of years to advance the agenda a nd is one the most effective weapon s of the Illuminati. Problem- reaction-solution is the key to und erstanding what really h appened on September 11th 2 001 and why. It works like this: you know that if you openly p ropose to b asic freedoms, start a war or centralise power, there will be a pub lic reac tion against it. So you don't openly and honestly p ropose such p lans, you play the P-R-S scam. At stage one you create a problem. It could b e a c oup attacking another, a gov ernment or econo mic c ollapse, or a 'terrorist attack. Anything in fact that the public will think requires a 'solution'. At stage two, you report the 'problems' you h ave c overtly created in the way you wish the people to p erceive them. Crucially you find someone to b lame for the problem, a 'patsy' like Lee Harvey Oswald when President Kennedy was assassinated, or Osama bin Laden. You spin the background to these e vents in a way that encouri1ges the people to d emand thi1t \"something must be don e\". These a re the words you want to h ear because they allow you to move on to stage three, the sting. At this point you op enly o ffer the solutions to the problems you h ave you rself created. These solutions, of course, invo lve the ce ntralisation o f power, the sacking o f officials or politicians that are getting in you r way, and the removal of more basic freedoms as you advance further to you r global fascist state. Just think o f the freedoms that have been removed b eca use of 9/11. A more subtle part of the technique is to p ropose far more extreme changes than you expect to g et away with b eca use this allows any oppo sition to think you h ave c ompromised and met them halfway. But you kno w that you h ave other 'problems' in the pipeline to pu sh the a genda on .. With this technique you can so manipulate the public mind that people will demand o r at least allow you to introdu ce what, in normal circumstances, they would v ehemently oppo se. The Oklahoma bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Building on April 19th 1995 was a problem-reac tion-solution classic, as I explained in And the Truth Sh all Set You Free and Alice in Wonderland an d the World Trade Ce1lter Disaster. What followed the death and d estruction in Oklahoma were 'anti-terrorism' laws that sailed through Congress without challenge ~ removed fund amental freedoms from American p eople. Since September 11th, this agenda has been advanced in g igantic leaps. I don 't share the a ttitudes of people like Timothy McVeigh, nor do I defend d isturbed p eople like Osama bin Laden, but that's not the point. Establishing the truth o f what happened is the point, no matter what the views and attitudes of those involved. It is called justice. The two most effective problem-reac tion-solutions in the twentieth century were the two g lobal wars. They changed the face of the world, as wars always do, and led to a massive ce ntralisation o f power. The United Nations, like its predece ssor the League of Nations, was an Illuminati creation to act as a Trojan ho rse, or stalking horse, for world g overnment. \"Journalistic\" junk The media play their part to p erfection in these 'problem-reac tion-solution' scenarios. At ownership level, people like Conrad Black at the Hollinger Group and Rupert Murdoch o f the News Corporation kno w w hat is going on . The e ditors they appoint might kno w something abou t it, as may certain columnists, but most of the journalists will have no idea. The e ditor is always there to b lock anything they write that is against the interests of the Illuminati - as directed by the owner-and if they insist on pursuing an un welcome story they find themselves looking for another job. Most of the 'information' that journalists present comes from official (Illuminati) sources anyway. In the imm ediate a ftermath o f a major event such as September 11 th, where a re the reporters getting their information from? Official sources! Name me a single piece of relevant information b roadcast by the mainstream m edia a bou t what happened on 9 /11, how it was don e, who d id it and what the retaliation shou ld b e, that did not come from official sources. Not one! We a re told that White House sources say this, FBI sources say that, and OA or Pentagon sources say the other. This is how the Illuminati transmit through the media the version o f events they wish the pub lic to b elieve. These reports are blazed across the front pages of newspapers and the top o f radio and television n ews bulletins throughou t the world, and what they say b ecomes the 'norm', the official 'history'. In the weeks and months that followed, researchers who are interested in the real truth b egin to dig away.

Therefore, years after"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 31 the official version h as been d emolished it still pre\\'ails in the public mind. Stop anyon e in London, New York, Cape Town, Sydn ey, anywhere, and ask them what happened on September 11th, or in Oklahoma, the Second World War or Kosovo . Almost every time they'll give you the official story b eca use that is the only on e they h ave heard. If \\\\\"e had real mainstream journalism the problem-reac tion-solution technique could no t work. The official version o f events would b e investigated and shown to h ave no found ation. This fact would b e c ommunicated to the people a nd the public reaction, desired by the a uthorities, would not be forthcoming. But instead, we have media that is little more than a pub lic relations office for the official version o f life a nd that makes problem-reac tion-solution a breeze for the manipulators. The 9/11 fairytale When I first heard abou t the a ttacks of September 11 th, 2001, I knew it was another problem-reac tion- solution. It contained every element of the technique: the 'problem' of four airliners hijacked ov er two hou rs with no effective respon se from the military o r gov ernment until the deeds been don e; the imm ediate naming o f the 'villain', Osama bin Laden, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever; the reaction o f the people in acce pting the official story and d emanding that \"something must be don e\"; and the 'solution', the destruction o f basic rights, freedoms and p rivacy in the name of a 'war on terrorism' that has s o tar cost the lives of more than 12 thou sand (minimum) civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. From the day those planes crashed I began to investigate the official stony and no t one strand o f it fits with another. It is the Big Lie a nd I document the backgroun d, in g reat detail over 500 p ages in Alice in Wonderland And the World Trade Center Disaster. The mainstream m edia merely repeated the lies of the US authorities and this beca me the a ccepted truth. It is a lie. When a c opy o f my book was s ent to every major newspaper, radio and television n ews and current affairs s how in the United States and United Kingdom they all ignored it, saw for one Scottish n ewspaper that interviewed me, but did no t report the c ontent. Osama bin Laden, a long-time a sset of the CIA, was no more the orchestrator of 9/11 than 1 was, It was organised through the very agencies that gave the media the official version, How many p eople kno w that at least seven o f the 19 h ijackers named by the FBI are still alive? What did they d o, parachute? How many kno w that the Bush family and the Bin Laden family h ave long b een extremely close 7 Or that the former head o f the family construction business, Salem bin Laden, brother of Osama, ,vas an investor in President Bush's first oil company? Or that an investor in a later Bush company was Khalid bin Mahfouz, an associate of Bin Laden, who was named by the US S tate Department during the Clinton administration as a fund er of the al-Qaeda terrorist network? Or that al-Qaeda was fund ed into existence by the CIA during the Soviet occupation o f Afghanistan? Or that the 'al-Qaeda' tunn el systems in Afghanistan were built by Bin Laden Construction with CIA money funnelled through Pakistan milit ary intelligence, the ISI, which is the CIA branch in Pakistan? Yet again it is a c ase of the same force controlling two apparent 'sides' to the same e nd. President Bashar Assad o f Syria has even doub ted the continuing existence of al-Qaeda and I und erstand that. \"Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?\" he a sked. Assad said Osama bin Laden\" canno t talk on the phon e or use the Internet, but he ca n d irect comm unications to the four corners of the world?\" As he pointed out, this is not 10gical.13 The official story o f 9/11 is s o blatantly p reposterous that every effort has been made by the Bush administration to stop any inqu iry into what happened. When h e was forced into placa ting such d emands, he a nnoun ced an investigation to b e headed by Henry Kissinger, one of the most prominent Illuminati operatives of the last more than 40 y ears. This was s o ou trageous even for Bush that Kissinger was forced by pu blic pressure to stand do wn when h e refused to n ame the clients of his Illuminati 'consulting firm', Kissinger Associates (see And The Truth S hall Set You Free for more a bou t its activities). In May 2003 , it \\\\ras revealed that Bush and the US intelligence a gencies were blocking the release of sensitive information abou t the a ttacks and d elaying pu blication o f a 900 -page c ong ressional report on ho w the terrorist assault happened. 1 \" \"The White House is continuing a trend o f presenting obstacles to u s rather than coop erating with u s\", said Tim Roemer, a former House member who p articipated in the c ong ressional inquiry.]; They were trying to suppress the findings of a report that accepts as its basic premise that the found ations of the official story (Osama bin Laden did it) are true. Not even that level of inquiry is acceptable, never mind on e that uncovers the real story - it was planned and carried ou t by forces within the United States. When the Cong ressional 'Inquiry' into 9 /11 published its report in July 20 03 the c ontent was truly p athetic. 'Anti-terrorist' terrorists Once a gain I emphasise that what appear to b e 'sides' in a c onflict are invariably controlled o r manipu lated by the same force (Figure 4). The Illuminati operate through Islamic terror group s as they do through American and British terror group s, i.e. the US and UK gov ernments. They appear to b e two 'sides' on the nightly n ews, but at the top o f the pyramid they answer to the same masters. As I was writing this book, a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 32 report by the United Kingdom's most senior police officer, Sir John Stevens, revealed what researchers had long k nown - the British Army and the Northern Ireland p olice force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), had colluded with the largest loyalist terrorist group, the Ulster Defense Association (UDA ), to murder Catholics. Stevens, the Metropo litan Police Commissioner, said that British military intelligence informants and agents \"were allowed to op erate withou t effective c ontrol and to p articipate in terrorist crimes\". He a lso found that British military intelligence in Northern Ireland h ad h elped to p rolong the conflict and murder kno wn as the 'Troub les' in the late 1980 s. The Stevens Report detailed ho w: Actions or omissions by 'security forces' led to deaths of inno cent people. Collusion by the 'security forces' was involved in the murders of solicitor Pat Finucane a nd student Adam Lambert. Three official inquiries into these e vents were wilfully ob structed and misled by the a uthorities respon sible. Stevens defined collusion as the wilful failure to k eep records; absence of accoun tability; withho lding intelligence; and evidence a nd agents involved in murder. The inquiry established that the British Army's secret agent handling team, the Force Research Unit, recruited a former terrorist paramilitary called Brian Nelson to return to Northern Ireland and rejoin the terrorist Ulster Defense Association. Nelson, codenamed 613 7, beca me the UD A's head o f intelligence a nd supplied the a rmy chiefs with the group 's possible targets. Army Intelligence then b asica14l' decided who was murdered. The Stevens team planned to arrest Nelson on January 10 th 19 90. When they returned to their secure headqu arters before the arrest they found their offices ablaze. Fire a larms, telephones and h eat-sensitive intruder alarms had b een d isabled. The fire destroyed many o f their files, but fortunately o thers had b een copied and moved to England. Brian Nelson fled Northern Ireland, but was later caugh t and jailed for ten y ears for conspiracy to murder, despite pleas on his behalf by Colonel Gordon Kerr of the British Army’s Force Research Unit. Nelson was released in 1999 and lived at a secret location in England. In April 2003 h e died o f a brain h aemorrhage only d ays before the Stevens Report was pub lished. How conv enient. Such was the obstruction o f the Stevens inquiry that the report took 14 y ears to d eliver. Stevens said that he a nd h is team were c onstantly spied up on and betrayed by po lice a nd army colleagues. He a dded that he was still determined to try to b ring Pat Finucane's killers to justice a nd h e was still investigating just how far up the c hain o f comm and the c ollusion might have gon e. Try the top. Figu re 4: The same force manipu lates throu gh both 'side s' to con trol the outcome a nd p roduce a 'movie' version o f even ts to foo l the pe ople I high light these findings beca use while it may h ave ca used a stir in the United Kingdom to know that British Army Intelligence a nd the Northern Ireland p olice a uthority were c ollud ing with terrorists to k ill people, this is the rule not the e xception across the world. It is happening all the time on a massive scale beca use the Illuminati agenda is the focus of these c rackpo ts, not preventing terrorism and murder. This is what happened on September 11th. The 'anti-terrorist' organisations like the (top level of) the National Security Agency, CIA, FBI, the United States gov ernment and milit ary, etc., were the forces through which the 9/11 attacks were both p lanned and allowed to h appen. Genuine FBI agents were incensed to h ave their inquiries into terror group s in the United States blocked by FBI headqu arters before 9/11 and President Bush o rdered an end to investigations into the terrorist activities of the Bin Laden family in the United States in the months before the a ttacks (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 33 Days after September 11 th, at least 11 members of the Bin Laden family in America were a llowed to leave for Saudi Arabia in a private jet from Boston Logan Airport. This was at a time when Osama bin Laden was the world's most wanted man and thou sands of Arabs were being arrested and jailed without trial across the c oun try just beca use of their name a nd skin colour. Why did this happen? The Bushes and Bin Ladens are long -time bosom buddies working to b asically the same e nd. Personn el from the military and intelligence c omm unity h ave been p lace d in k ey po sts in the Bush administration since 9/11, including General John A. Gordon, former deputy CIA director, as White House 'homeland-security [control] advisor'. The horrors of September 11th h ave been u sed, as intended, to further the a genda for global control and the destruction o f fr eedom. Amnesty International's 2003 annu al report says: \"The 'war on terror', far fr om making the world a safer place, has made it more dangerous by curtailing hu man rights, undermining the rule of international law and shielding gov ernments from scrutiny.\" 16 The report acc used gov ernments of \"trampling ov er human rights in the name of fighting terrorism\". Put another way: problem-reac tion- solution. Amnesty's s ecretary g eneral, Irene Khan, said: \"What would h ave been un acceptable on September 10th, 2001, is now becoming almost the norm. What would h ave been an ou trage in Western coun tries during the Cold War - torture, detention withou t trial, truncated justice - is readily acce pted in some c oun tries today for some people.\" 17 The report continues: \"Governments have spent billions to strengthen n ational security and the 'war on terror'. Yet for millions of people, the real sources of insecurity are c orruption, repression, discrimination, extreme pov erty and p reventable diseases.\" IS But it does not suit the a genda to address s uch issues, quite the reverse, and so the suffering go es on. Totalitarian tip-toe The bedfellow of problem-reac tion-solution is the stepping-stones approach o r the totalitarian tip-toe a s I call it. You kno w w here you intend to lead p eople, but you realise that if you g ave them the true picture or went there in o ne giant leap, you would face substantial opposition. So you travel to y our destination in little steps and each on e is presented in isolation and un connected to all the others. It is like a drip, drip, drip, to global centralisation. This technique was used most obviously with the super-state now kno wn as the European Union. After the war if the politicians had sugg ested a centralised Europe with common laws and currency', there would h ave been an ou tcry. People would h ave said they h ad b een fighting Hitler to stop just such a European d ictatorship and there was no way they were accepting another. To ov ercome this, the Illuminati offered a 'free trade a rea' and even u sed the problem of their manipu lated \"'odd \"'wars to encourage more c oop eration b etween the coun tries of Europe. Once they h ad the free trade area their foot in the doo r, they b egan to expand its powers until it beca me the full fledged p olitical and econo mic dictatorship that it is today. As I write, the plans have been released to introdu ce a new 'European Constitution' that would install a President of the European Union, a Foreign Secretary, and turn the coun tries of Europe into mere regions of the super-state. One of the organisations within the Illuminati web is called the Bilderberg Group and it has had a policy for a centrally-controlled United States of Europe since its official formation in May, 1954 . Britain was taken into the European trap by Prime Minister Ted Heath (Bilderberg Group), and this po licy was suppo rted by his 'opposition' Labou r Party o f Harold Wilson (Bilderberg Group), James Callaghan (Bilderberg Group ) and Denis Healey (Bilderberg Group). The new' European Union constitution was officially p roposed by former French p resident Valery Giscard d 'Estaing (Bilderberg Group) and is s upported by Tony Blair (Bilderberg Group). I have been writing for years that one of the reasons Tony Blair was place d in o ffice was to take Britain into the sing le European currency, the Euro and a c entrally-dictated United States of Europe. This is who, no matter what tilt' arguments are against this s urrender of fr eedom, or the public feeling abou t these plans, he will seek to p ress the c hanges through . He has refused d emands for referendu m on the European constitution b eca use he kno ws he would lose. The referendu m he was forced to p romise on the e uro will involve Illuminati operatives from all areas of society, frightening the public into agreement with threats of econo mic disaster if we don 't give up the sterling. The same superstate structure is planned to be introduced through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NA FTA); Asia Pacific Econo mic Co- operation (APEC), the 'free trade area' for Asia a nd Australia; and the African Union that replace d the Organisation o f African Unity in 2001 . I said in And The Truth S hall Set You Free in 19 95 that the AFTA 'free trade a rea' would b e e xpanded to the whole of the Americas as the next stepping stone to a ce ntrally controlled American Union. In 2 00], George \\Y Bush attended the Summ it of the Americas in Quebec, Canada, at which this expansion o f NA FL\\ throughout the Americas was agreed. Look at today's newspapers and television n ews bulletins and you see problem-reaction-solution and the totalitarian tip-toe played ou t day after day. One extremely effective way to see through this manipu lation is to k eep asking you rself a simple question when faced with these daily situations: \"Who b enefits from m e believing this version o f events, or acce pting the solutions and changes being o ffered as a result?\" The answer will be a lmost every time: anyone who wishes to centralise power and supp ress more of our"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 34 freedoms. Politics, econo mics, big bu siness, the military, the media, religion and all the rest are part of a vast web o f inter-conn ected manipulation d esigned to p ersuade the masses to pu t themselves in p rison and throwaway the key. The Illuminati work through every b elief system, religious, political, econo mic, racial and cultural- and through every side in the major 'debates'. If you want to kno w the outcome of a game before the game has even started, you n eed to control all sides. The manager of a football team canno t dictate the result if he only controls one side. If, however, he is managing b oth sides, he ca n ensure the result he wants before a ball is kicked. So it is with the Illuminati, the Hidden Hand b ehind the e vents that affect our lives and ou r world every d ay. We shou ld b e a ware, when contemplating what happened in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11 the, that the Illuminati operate through secret societies in the Near and Middle East every b it as much as they do in the United States and the so-called 'West'. We see this manipulation o f both sides in the protests against globalisation. To control the public perception o f these gathering p rotests the Illuminati have organised their own agents provo cateur to start the violence we see on the news broadcasts. See my website www.davidicke.com for more background to this, includ ing the a ccoun t of how mainstream journalists watched the police lines open up at a protest in Spain to allow a group with weapon s and masked faces to walk through to the peace fully p rotesting crowd. This group then started to attack each o ther, thus 'justifying' a police c harge on the peaceful gathering in which people were battered by these uniformed h ead cases. Once the police intervention h ad b egun, the journalists watched the group who started the troub le walk calmly b ack through the police lines to b e driven away in police vehicles. One was asked if he was a policeman. \"Yes\" was his first reply when caugh t off-guard, but he then d enied it. Done deal It is the totalitarian tip-toe that explains why p olitical leaders push ahead with p olicies no matter what the evidence or the views of the people. They are following the a genda a nd no thing is allowed to g et in the way. The invasion o f Ir aq is an ob vious case. This was decided long b efore it happened, as we shall see, but George Bush and Tony Blair continued to say that war was not inevitable when they kn ew the date the troop s were going in. Public 'debate' is just part of the smokescreen to h ide the a genda and g ive the people the illusion that they live in a free and op en society. The European superstate, fluoride in public drinking water and g enetically modified food are a ll examples of the 'don e deal' with regard to Britain while Tony Blair tells the people they are not. The manipulation o f the 'debate' in the United Kingdom on g enetically modified o r 'GM' food is a c lassic of its kind. Blair said h e wanted a pub lic debate on the issue a nd then delayed all scientific reports into the potential (lethal) dangers of it until after the 'debate' had taken p lace . Michael Meac her, the Secretary o f State for the Environment sacked by Blair in 2 003, has s ince highlighted the lack o f research and the serious risk po sed by GM food. He has also confirmed that Tony Blair appeared uninterested in the science a nd was determined that GM food b e given the go ahead. Of course that is the case. G\\1 food worldwide is the Illuminati plan b eca use it will (a) create the health and g enetic c hanges in humans that they want to introduce; (b) und ermine the human immune system; and (c) make every g rower on the planet no matter how' poo r, dependent on the seeds of the translational (Illuminati) and the prices they charge for them. Control and p opulation reduction is \\\\'hat G\\1 food is all about. The c orporation behind GM foods is the a ppalling Monsanto in St Lou is, Missouri, that has been featured many times in my book s, It is Illuminati to its fingertips and the Bush administration is awash with its personn el. When you qu estion the Blair (I lluminati) line, as with Bush in the United States, the c onsequences can b e brutal. Dr Arpad Pusztai is considered the world expert on GM food with more than 270 published studies relating to the subject. He was working at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, when h e was inteviewed for a World in Action television do cumentary on Augu st 10 th, 1998. What he said was to destroy h is career because of the reaction o f Tony Blair. Dr Pusztai told a programm e that rats fed on certain GM potatoes had suffered stunted g rowth, damage to the imm une system and their liver, heart and other organs got smaller. He said this was also the ca se with the brain, but he had no t mentioned that to avoid b eing \"alarmist\". He said o f GM food: \"If I had the c hoice I would certainly no t eat it.\" 19 On the evening the interview w as broadcast, Dr Pusztai was cong ratulated for his contribution by Professor Philip James, Director of the Rowett Institute. The next morning the Institute issued a press release highlighting the \"range of carefully controlled studies und erlie the basis of Dr Pusztai's concerns Forty eight hou rs later he was s uspended and o rdered to h and ov er all his data. His research team was disbanded and h e was threatened with legal action if he spok e to anyon e on the subject. Eyen h is personal assistant was banned from talking to him and h e was alerted to an Institute press release that his contract was not being renewed. His wife was also sacked. Dr Pusztai was to have two h eart attacks and h is wife was put on p ermanent medication for high b1 ood p ressure. The Rowett Institute lied and lied abou t the reasons for their disgrace ful treatment of Dr Pusztai, as was later proved. The truth was that his comm ents on GM food, coming from such a world class s ource, had threatened to b10 w apart the Illuminati plan. He had to b e destroyed with the usual vind ictiveness. Dr Pusztai is certain that his demise was G1Used by Tony B1air."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 35 He says that the day after the World ill Action programm e, two phon e ca lls were made by Blair's office to his boss, Philip James, and the next din h e was fired.' Dr Pusztai says he was told by a senior manager at Rowett t hat Blair's intention was prompted by a phon e ca ll from United States President Bill Clinton. The story was confirmed by Professor Robert Orskov , one the Britain's top nu trition researchers, who worked for Rowett for 33 y ears. He said h e was told that phone ca lls went from Monsanto to Clinton and then to Blair. \"Clinton rang Blair and Blair rang James\", he said. \"There is no doub t he was pushed by Blair to do something. It was damaging the relationship b etween the United States and the United Kingdom beca use it was going to b e a hug e blow for Monsanto.\" 21 David Hill, the director of Good Relations, the Monsanto public relations company in the UK , ran the media ca mpaign for Blair's Labou r Party in the General Election victories of 1997 and 2 001. 23 Another eminent researcher, Stanley Ewen, said that he was told the same story by another senior figure a t Rowett: \"That conversation is s ealed in my mind. My jaw dropped to the floor. I suddenly s aw it all - it was the missing link. Until then , I couldn't understand h ow on Monday Arpad h ad made the most wonderful breakthrough. and on Tuesday it was the most dreadful piece of work and rejected ou t of hand.\" 24 The vicious campaign against Dr Pusztai was as coordinated as it was callous. Reports attacking him were published by the Illuminati Royal Society - the scientific e stablishment expo sed in my o ther book s - and by the Science a nd Techno logy select comm ittee of the House of Comm ons with its pro-Blair majority. Cabinet minister Jack Cunn ingham, another Blair , cond emned Dr Pusztai's \"wholly misleading results\" and said that all GM food in Britain would b e safe to eat. 25 But how does a prat like Cunningh am know-that, compared with the world's leading authority? It has nothing to do with truth o r protecting the public. It is political business. GM food is a don e deal. The Blair gov ernment is one of the most corrupt in all British history and it has fund amental ties to the biotech industry. In its first two y ears in o ffice GM food companies met gov ernment officials and ministers 81 times. 26 Blair's unelected Science Minister, Lord Sainsbury, is a dedicated suppo rter of GM food . When h e was appo inted h e held large shareholdings in the biotech companies, Diatech and Inno tech, which were place d in a 'blind trust' so that he could n ot kno wingly b enefit from decisions he makes in gov ernment. Oh please. Has he forgotten h e has them then? He made £20 million p rofit i n four years from Inno tech and such wealth allows him to b e the biggest sing le dono r to Blair's Labou r Party with p ayments of more than £8 million since it came to po wer. 27 But what of Professor James, the head o f Rowett, who also felt the wrath o f dictator Blair? At the time he e njoyed go od relations with Blair and h ad b een chosen to h ead the planned Food Standards Agency. But that changed after Dr Pusztai made his comm ents. \"You d estroyed me\", he told Dr Pusztai. 28 This is how the Illuminati work to stifle dissent and mislead the public. You want to advance you r career? OK , do what we want and you 'll be fine. Speak you r mind and we'll destroy you . Anyone still wond er why o nly sycoph ants s urround these people? Fresh air money One of the most important aspects of the bloodline-Illuminati control of humanity is the money system. The Illuminati financial sting is very simple a nd spans the period from Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is based on creating money that doesn't exist and lending it to p eople a nd bu sinesses in return for interest. This creates an enormous debt for gov ernments, business and the general pop ulation and allows you to control them. Vital to this has been p ermitting b ankers to lend money they do no t have. If you o r I have a milli on pounds we ca n lend a million pounds. But if a bank h as a million po unds it can lend ten times that and more, and charge interest on it. If even a fraction o f the people who theoretically h ave money d eposited in a bank went today to remove it, the banks would slam the doo r in h alf an hou r beca use they don 't have it. Money in the bank is a myth, another confidence trick. When you go into a bank and ask for a loan, the bank do es not print a single new note, nor mint a sing le new coin. It merely types the a moun t of the loan into y our acc oun t. From that moment you are paying interest to the bank on what is no more than figures typed on a screen. However, if you fail to p ay b ack that non -existent loan, the bank can come a long and quite legally take you r wealth that does exist, you r home, land, car and po ssessions, to the e stimated v alue of whatever figure was typed on to that screen - plus interest. More than that, because money is not brought into circulation by gov ernments, but by p rivate banks making loans to customers, the banks control how much money is in circulation. The more loans they choo se to make, the more money is in circulation. What is the difference between an econo mic boo m (prosperity) and an econo mic depression (pov erty)? One thing only - the a moun t of money in circulation. Through this s ystem, the private banks, controlled by the same Illuminati families, decide how much money will be in circulation. They can create boo ms and bu sts at will. It is the same with the stock markets through which these families are making trillions of dollars a day around the financial and b anking system and d eciding if they go up o r down, soar or crash. Stock market crashes don 't just happen - they are made to h appen. Why would the Illuminati do this when they h ave so"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 36 much money invested in these markets? If you kno w the c rash is coming b eca use you are going to cause it, you kno w to sell at the highest point and buy b ack in on ce the c rash h as happened. In this way you can increase you r holdings massively by acquiring companies at a fraction o f the c ost before you r manipulated collapse. Most of the 'money' in circulation is not physical money: cash and coins. It is represented by figures passing from one c omputer acc oun t to another electronical1y via money transfers, credit cards and cheque-book s. The more money, electronic or otherwise, that is in circulation, the more ec ono mic ac tivity can take place and the more produ cts are bough t and sold, the more income people ha\\'e a nd the more jobs are a vailable. But a c onstant theme of this Illuminati financial coup h as been to create a boo m by making lots of loans and then p ulling the plug, causing a depression o r crash. Overpaid econo mists and econo mic c orrespond ents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tell you that boom and bu st is part of some natural 'econo mic c ycle'. It is not. It is s ystematic manipulation by the Illuminati to steal the real wealth o f the world. During a boo m m any p eople get themselves into more debt. The vibrant econo mic ac tivity means that businesses borrow more for new techno logy to increase produ ction to meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger hou se a nd a more e xpensive ca r because they are so confident of their econo mic prospects. Then, at the most oppo rtune moment, the major banks, coordinated by the Illuminati network, raise interest rates to supp ress the demand for loans and b egin to call in loans already ou tstanding. They ensure they make far fewer loans than b efore. This has the effect of taking u nits of exchange (money in its various forms) out of circulation. This s uppresses demand for produ cts and leads to fewer jobs beca use there is not enough money in circulation to g enerate the necessary econo mic ac tivity. People a nd bu sinesses can no long er earn enough to repay their loans and they go b ankrupt. The banks then take over their real wealth, their business, home, land, car and o ther possessions in return for non-repayment of a loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen. This has been go ing on in cycles over thou sands of years, especially the last few centuries, and the real wealth o f the world h as been sucked ou t of the pop ulation and into the hands of those who control the banking system - the Illuminati bloodline families. The same a pplies to coun tries. Instead o f creating their own interest-free money, governments borrow it from the private banking cartel and p ay the interest and the capital (sometimes) by taxation o f the people. A fantastic a moun t of the money that you p ay in taxes goes straight to the private banks to p ay b ack loans of 'money', which g overnments could c reate themselves interest free! Why don 't they do it? The Illuminati control the gov ernments as much as they control the banks. What we ca ll 'privatisation' is the selling o f state assets in respon se to b ank-created d ebt. The world's poo rest coun tries are handing over control of their land and resources to the Illuminatl\"\"1:iankers beca use they can't pay back the loans made, on pu rpose, by the banks to ensnare them in this very situation. The world/does not have to b e in pov erty and conflict. It is manipulated to b e that way because it serves the agenda. 'Third World' debt was manufactured to replace phy sical occupation o f resource-rich o r strategically situated coun tries und er colon ialism with today's financial occupation. The way they created this situation is told in d etail in And The Truth Sha ll Set You Free. Once a c oun try is indebted to foreign banks, even thou gh the money is non -existent credit, they are forced to h and ov er control of their affairs to the bankers, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which then dictate ec ono mic a nd social policy at every level. It all leads to the same cabal, the Illuminati, and the same word: control. One other point to emphasise is the way that we are paying for our own p rison at every turn. The Illuminati own the banking system and every time we put money in a bank o r borrow from one we a re fund ing the agenda for global dictatorship. It is the same when we buy from translational corporations, like the food , fuel and d rugs that people purchase from the food , oil and pharmace utical cartels- Think o f everything we buy from the Illuminati global network o f companies - includ ing television and the rest of the media - and every time we a re filling the c offers of our prison b uilders. But it doesn't stop there. The Illuminati also control the gov ernments and ho w their money is s pent. Our tax money fund s the a genda a nd we are taxed on everything: our income, what we buy , even what we insure. Almost every hu man activity is taxed. If you worked ou t how much o f our income we actually k eep when we take a ll this into acc oun t we would b e staggered at how much is taken by those who claim to b e serving u s. Even sex is taxed -and ho w. When the rubb er is imported for a c ondo m, the gov ernment charges a tax. The company making the c ondo m is taxed for buying the rubb er and on the profit it makes from the sale, and the e mployees are taxed on their wages. The c ompany transporting the c ondo m to the shop s is taxed on the profit and there a re taxes for using their vehicles. The driver is taxed on h is income. The shop selling the c ond oms is taxed on the profit and the person who makes the sale is taxed on their wages. The customer is then charged sales tax, what we ca ll VA T in Britain, for the privilege of buying the c ondo m. No do ubt there will soon b e a tax on u sing it. Speeding and p arking fines are another form of taxation and on -road p arking is a perfect example of how we a re manipulated to p ay for the same thing many times. In this case we pay through taxation for the roads to b e built and maintained (when o ften they are not); we pay road tax for the right to u se our car; we pay massive tax to the gov ernment in the fuel we buy and when we have our vehicles s erviced and repaired; then, having p aid out all this, we a re forced to p ay to p ark ou r cars on the very roads we have already p aid"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 37 for. If we don 't we a re fined and that money also go es to the Illuminati gov ernmental system.

Criminal bankruptcy When you b egin to look b ehind the movie screen o r more a ppropriately u nder the stone, you see a very different world to the one portrayed on CNN . Some researchers and lawyers reveal that in the 1930 s the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and many o thers officially d eclared bankruptc y , but somehow forgot to tell the people. This apparently h appened du ring the five years of the Geneva c onv entions in Switzerland b etween 1928 and 19 32, but it seems that they don 't publish the volume containing the details of the bankruptcy d eclarations. The bankers said that either the c oun tries declared bankruptcy to the Illuminati banks or there would b e no loans to g et them out of the deep g lobal depression at that time. They accepted o fficial bankruptcy to the global banking system and this meant, in effect, that the banks have owned those coun tries ever since.:' Actual\"', I say coun tries, but the United States is not actually a c oun try, but a c orporation, as revealed in my p revious book s and many o ther published works and studies. ~ o doub t we will find that the situation is the same in o ther coun tries too. This bankruptcy is in the United States Cong ressional Record o f March 17 th 1993 (Vol. 33, page H-1303 ). James Traficant Jr of Ohio told the House: \"Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization o f any Bankrupt entity in world h istory. the US Government. We a re setting forth hopefully, a b lueprint for our future. There are some who say it is a coroner's report that will l ead to o ur demise. \"It is an e stablished fact that the United States Federal Government has been d issolved b y the Emergency Banking Act.

This act was instituted a nd established b y transferring and /or placing the Office of the Secretary of Treasury to that of the Governor of the International Monetary Fund. Public Law 94-564, page 8 , Section H.R. 1 ~ 5 reads in p art: 'The US Secretary of Treasury receives no compen sation for representing the United States'. \"Why are 90 % of Americans mortgaged to the h ilt and h ave little o r no a ssets after all deb ts and liabilities have b een paid?

Few of our elected representatives in Washington DC ha ve d ared to tell the truth. The federal United States is ban krupt. Our children will i nherit this un- payable d ebt, and the tyranny to e nforce pa ying it.\" James Traficant was later jailed for alleged b ribery and corruption b eca use he was getting too close to the truth on many issues affecting the Illuminati agenda. The United States corporation was created b ehind the screen o f a 'Federal Government' when, after the manufactured 'victory' in the American War of 'Independence', the British colonies exchanged ov ert dictatorship from London with the far more e ffective covert dictatorship that has been in p lace e ver since. In effect, the Virginia Company, the c orporation headed by the British Crown that controlled the 'former' colonies, simply changed its name to the United States and o ther related p seudony ms. These include the US, USA, United States of America, Washington DC, District of Columbia, Federal Government and 'Feds'. The United States Corporation is based in the District of Columbia a nd the c urrent president of the c orporation is a man called George W. Bush. He is not the president of the people or the c oun try as they are led to b elieve, that's just the smokescreen. This means that Bush launched a 'war on terrorism' on b ehalf of a private c orporation to further the goals of that corporation. It had no thing to do with' America' or 'Americans' because these a re very d ifferent legal entities. It is the United States Corporation that owns the United States military and everything else that comes und er the term 'federal'. This includes the Federal Reserve, the 'central bank' of the United States, which is, in reality, a private bank o wned by controlling stockholders (and controllers of the US Corporation) that are not eyen American."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 38 This is the bank from which the United States Corporation bo rrows 'money'. The Federal Reserve was manipulated into existence in 1913 and dictates the United States interest rate that has a massive kno ck-on effect on the rest of the world. The Federal Reserve or 'Fed' is currently h eaded by Alan Greenspan, a member of Illuminati front organisations like the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. His predece ssor was Paul W. Volker of ... the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission (see And The Truth Sh all Set You Free). The United States Corporation is owned by families and forces in Europe a nd the Jesuit-controlled Vatican is at the heart of this covert ownership, of not on ly the United States, but major European 'coun tries' like the United Kingdom also (see Append ix I). 'Floating' courts The privately o wned corporation kno wn as the United States is the holding company, if you like, and the 50 states are its s ubsidiaries. This means that these states also d eclared b ankruptcy, or had it declared for them by the holding company, the 'Federal Government', but the people never knew and still don't. You can g et the detail abou t this elsewhere and I am only summ arising the situation to give people a n idea of how deep this conspiracy really go es, The sting h as been set up so that when you register with the 'Federal Government' in any \"' by accepting a Social Security nu mber, driver's licence, or any o f the other official federal documents, you are, unknowingly, agreeing to b ecome a n asset-employee of the United States Corporation. From that moment you become respon sible for financing the c orporation's s tate of bankruptcy, When you p ay taxes or a c ourt or parking fine a nd such like, you are servicing the bankruptcy by p aying that money to gov ernment agencies that are nothing more than d ebt-collecting agencies for the creditor banks. The US court system operates und er corporate law or the Uniform Comm ercial Code (UCC ) to administer the bankruptcy and fleec e the sheep to p ay b ack the ongo ing d ebt. This is also known as British Maritime (military) Law and this is why the American flag always has a gold fringe when d isplayed in the courts of the United States. You find the same in gov ernment buildings and federally fund ed schools. The gold fringe is a legal symbol indicating that the c ourt is s itting und er British Maritime Law and the Uniform Comm ercial Code - military and merchant law not comm on o r constitutional law, under the Admiralty Law of Flags, the flag displayed g ives notice of the law und er which the ship (in this case the court) is regulated. Anyon e e ntering that ship (court) accepts by do ing so that they are submitting to the law indicated by that flag, Judges refuse to replace the flag with on e without a fringe when asked by d efendants who kno w the score beca use that changes the law' und er which the c ourt is s itting. If you appear in a c ourt with a gold- fringed flag y our constitutional rights are suspended and you are being tried und er British Maritime (milit ary /merchant) Law. The Uniform Comm ercial Code was approved the American Bar Association, which is a franchise, a subo rdinate branch, of the British legal system and its hierarchy b ased in Lond on's Temple Bar (named after the Illuminati Knights Templar secret society). As I have been writing for many years, the power that controls America is based in Britain and Europe beca use that is where the power is located that owns the United States Corporation. By the way, if you think it is s trange that a c ourt on d ry land could be a dministered und er Maritime Law, look at US Code, Title 18 B 7. It says that Admiralty Jurisdiction is applicable in the following locations: (1) the high seas; (2) any American ship; (3) any lands reserved o r acquired for the use of the United States, and und er the e xclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any p lace purchased o r otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the state. In o ther words, mainland America. All this is founded on Roman law because the Illuminati have been p laying this s ame game through out the ce nturies wherever they h ave gon e. The major politicians kno w that this is how things are a nd so do the gov ernment administrators, judges, lawyers and insider 'journalists'. Those who realise what is happening and ask the c ourt for the name of the true c reditor or recipients of the fines imposed by the 'l egal system' are a lways refused this information by the judg e. The true creditors in such cases, and the ultimate recipient of the fines, are the bankers to which the c orporation 'coun try' is bankrupt. More a nd more people in the United States are refusing to register in any way with the Federal Government, as news and do cumentation o f this bizarre situation continues to circulate. If the authorities can keep this fantastic dece it from the mass of the people since the 1930 s, you can appreciate why they were confident they could ensure that what really h appened on September 11th stays comfortably und er wraps. Through out this book I will refer to what is though t to b e the gov ernment of 'America' as the United States or the US and when I talk o f the 'US gov ernment' and similar terms, I am referring to the privately owned United States Corporation that is masquerading as the 'gov ernment'. It is not the gov ernment of a nation o r coun try, it is a private c orporation acting purely in the interests of the families that own and control it. The' American' president is the c orporation's chief executive officer. The (shitty) City "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 39 It is the same story in the United Kingdom. When the a uthorities talk o f the 'The Crown', they are not referring to the King o r Queen, but 'The City', a privately o wned Corporation (sovereign sh1te) consisting o f 677 acres at the heart of the urban sprawl kno wn as 'Greater London '. 'The City' has a pop ulation o f 5,000 while Greater London is home to eight milli on, but in that small area massive global power is wielded. 'The Crown' is a ac tually comm ittee of 12 to 14 men who rule the independent sovereign state kno wn as 'The City', which is not a part of England and no t subject to the Sovereign nor the rule of Parliament. It is headed by a Lord Mayor who is elected for one year and is always a Freemason. The sitting monarch h as to bo w to the Mayor when h e or she wishes to enter the City and must ask for his permission. He meets the monarch at Temple Bar, named after the Knights Templar. I have included more background to the City and its secret society web in The Biggest Secret, but this is where the United Kingdom and much o f the wider \"( world is gov erned from - including the United States and Canada.

The British monarch is also a subo rdinate representative of the Pope (in o ther words the Illuminati network that controls the Vatican, especially the \" Jesuits). One c onfirmation o f this was the Peace Treaty b etween the American Colonies and the British 'Crown' ('the City') in 17 ~ 3, which states the following: \"It having p leased the Divine Providence to d ispose the h earts of the most serene a nd most potent Prince George the Third, by the g race of God, king of Great Britain, France a nd Ireland, defender of the faith, duke of Brunswick and L unebourg, arch-treasurer and prince e lector of the Holy Roman Empire etc., and of the United States of America ... \" (My emphasis.) The United Kingdom, or rather 'the City', controls the United States, yes, but as a vassal of the Roman Church, which owns Great Britain and Ireland (see Append ix I). There you h ave a summ ary o f the background and history to the global conspiracy and the techniques used to hood wink the people into b elieving they are free when their most fund amental rights to freedom of expression and freedom of choice a re being curtailed by the day. The Illuminati agenda for the ce ntralised global dictatorship and the 'movie' to fool the people a re runn ing side by side. They are two 'tracks' or story boards (Figure 5). Track on e is the 'agenda' - the secret agenda for global control; track two is the public 'movie' - the version o f events 'reported' through the mainstream m edia that is designed to hide the a genda and justify its introduction. When the 'agenda' requires s omething to b e don e, the 'movie' is s cripted to sell the people a c over story for why that needs to h appen. When the 'agenda' requires the c onqu est of Iraq, the movie bangs out the mantra of 'weapon s of mass destruction'. When it demands the c onqu est of Afghanistan, the 'movie' tells the pop ulous that Bin Laden was behind 9 /11 and h e is based in Afghanistan suppo rted by the Taliban. The reason so many lies can b e identified in the c over stories is beca use that is just what they are: stories. They are inventions to d upe the people into acce pting another stage of an agenda they h ave no ideas exists. These 'doub le tracks' also explain why y ou find the people involved with the secret 'agenda' are a lso supplying weapon s to the very d ictators they say must be removed b ecause of those weapon s. Once you realise how the game works it is no longer a mystery why those offering the solutions are those creating the problems in the first place .

I am going to look in d etail at the a ppalling events that have followed 9 /11, especially the invasion o f Ir aq and the 'war on terrorism', beca use the hidden h and o f the Illuminati and their methods of operation could no t be more obvious. Understanding this is vital to p reventing a repeat through out the world. I have described the background to the invasion o f Afghanistan in considerable detail in Alice in Wonderland an d the World Trade Center Disaster. They u sed the excuse of their own terrorist attacks on September 11th to invade a stone-age c oun try in the middle of a famine a nd impose their own regime und er the pupp et leadership o f Hamid Karsai. He is a former advisor to the major Texas-based o il company, Unocal, which planned to b uild an o il and g as pipeline from the Caspian Sea region across western Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea c oast of Pakistan, but could no t do so while the Taliban were in po wer. There is an Illuminati frenzy to control and tap the e normous reserves of oil and g as around the Caspian Sea and, beca use it is land locked, they n eed to bu ild pipelines to transport it to world markets. Coun tries like Afghanistan and Iran are on the potential pipeline routes (Figure 6). Unocal had no p roblem negotiating with the Taliban through the 1990 s to b uild their pipelines across Afghanistan and no r did the US S tate Department. However, public oppo sition to the deal in the face of the Taliban's human rights abuses, not least against women, made the deal impossible. Unocal pulled o ut of the project in 19 97 saying that the pipeline c ould no t be built until an internationally recognised regime was in po wer in Afghanistan. Thanks to 9 /11 and the c laims that the 'Afghanistan-located' CIA-asset, Osama bin Laden, was respon sible (based on no evidence), the Illuminati-controlled United States and British gov ernments could send in the bombers to remove the Taliban and replace 'them with the Unocal employed Hamid Karsai. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 42 Figure 6: The p ig-trough frenzy to control the massive Caspian Sea o il and ga s reserves is one major reason why the US government, supported by Britain's Tony Blair, targeted Afghanistan a fter 9/11, This is the a pproximate route of the Unocal pipeline On December 31st 2002 , after the removal of the Taliban George W. Bush appo inted a man called Zalmay Khalilzad as his 'special envoy ' to Afghanistan to ov ersee the 'transition' to the new post-Taliban regime. Khalilzad, an Illuminati operative, was chief consultant to Unocal on the Afghanistan pipeline project! He co-wrote in the winter 2000 issue of The Washing ton Quarterly: “Afghanistan could p rove a valuable corridor for this [Caspian Sea] energy as well as for access to markets in Central Asia.\" He had tried to overcome the problem that the Taliban was not internationally recognised by pu blicly lobbying for the US gov ernment to 'reengage' with the regime that caused un told murder, torture a nd suffering, and h e defended the Taliban against allegations of spon soring terrorism.! It was partly on Khalilzad's advice that the Clinton Administration fund ed the Taliban through Pakistan intelligence, even p aying the salaries of high-ranking Taliban o fficials. 2 So long as the Taliban played the game with the pipeline, who cares what they do to their people? When this plan went pear-shaped and the pipeline had to b e shelved, Khalilzad changed h is position to suit the c ircumstance ~ . As a State and Defense Department official during the Reagan-Bush administrator, he helped to supp ly the Mujahadeen with weapon s during the occupation by the Soviet Union, the period when Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda were fund ed and armed by the United States. As Bush's special envoy to Afghanistan, it was Khalilzad who h elped to oversee the c hange-over from the 'transitional' gov ernment led by fellow U nocal front man, Hamid Karsai, to the fully-fledged' Afghanistan' gov ernment with Karsai again the pupp et president answerable to the United States. As a result of this, the pipeline that Karsai and Khalilzad were both employed to make happen, is now going ahead. Surprised? Khalilzad comes from one of the old ruling elite families in Afghanistan and h is father was an aide to King Zahir Shah, who ruled the c oun try until he went into exile in 1973 . Thanks to the installation o f Hamid Karsai, a representative of Zahir Shah, the king returned to the Presidential Palace in Kabul in 2002 . Since the removal of the Taliban the opium produ ction in Afghanistan h as s oared to fuel the heroin market, controlled by the Bush family and their associates and masters, exactly as planned. Zalmay Khalilzad was later appo inted by Bush to b e his envoy to Iraq, so h e c ould play the same scam there in arranging for a US- controlled 'Iraqi' gov ernment to replace Saddam Hussein. More a bou t Khalilzad shortly - there is plenty to kno w. According to plan The invasion o f Afghanistan, like 9/11, had b een planned for a long time a nd it was the same with the conqu est of Ir aq in the spring o f 2003 . Time magazine reported that during a briefing for three senators by the National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, in March 200 2, President Bush pok ed h is head into a White House meeting room and b ellowed, \"Fuck Saddam. We're taking him out!\" 3 This was a year before the invasion and y et, on ly weeks before the troop s went in, we had Bush, Blair and their fellow travellers in gov ernment still saying that war was not inevitable!! If they ever told the truth they would h ave a seizure from the shock The plan to take Control of the Gulf region u sing Saddam Hussein as the e xcuse was in place long b efore Bush and the rest of his Illuminati mafia were illegally place d in power against the will of the people in late 2000 . An article by writer Nicholas Lemann in the New Yorker revealed that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, Dick Cheney, now the Vice President, formed a group to plan a strategy for the 1990 s and b eyond . 4 This group included the c urrent Secretary o f Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the c urrent Deputy Secretary o f Defense Paul Wolfowitz, the c urrent Secretary o f State Colin Powell and Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, Cheney's chief 0 staff. The aim was to 'shape' the world in their desired image or, as another ~ . member, Zalmay Khalilzad, put it ... to \"preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future\". Yes, the same Zalmay 'Unocal' Khalilzad who would b e named Bush's s pecial envoy to Afghanistan b efore 9/11 followed by the same role in Iraq at the time of the invasion. Lemann says he was shown a c opy o f the document Cheney's group pu t together called Defense Strategy for the 19905: The Regional Defense Strategy, Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, January 1993 . This was the month that Bill Clinton was inaugu rated and Cheney and father Bush left office. This 'strategy', planned in the ea rly 19 90s, is pretty much what the boy Bush and Cheney gov ernment is doing today - a gov ernment controlled by the people who pu t the document together. The 'war on terrorism' was a respon se to September 11 th? Sure. Still more c onfirmation o f this came with the publication o f a secret document produ ced for the yet-to-be- not-elected Bush administration in September 200 0, a year before 9/11 and two and h alf years before the troop s were sent into Iraq. The document was called Rebu ilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces and Resources For A New Century; and was produ ced in September 2000 by the neo-conservative 'think-tank' called The Project for the New A merican Century (PNA C). You can read it in full at the PNA C website. 5 This organisation was created in 1 997 by p eople like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and the report was produ ced for ~ themselves and o ther highly significant names that are today at the heart of the Bush administration, includ ing Paul Wolfowitz, now Rumsfeld's deputy at the Pentagon , and Lewis Libby,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 43 Cheney's chief of staff. Bush's young er brother, Jeb, the gov ernor of Florida during the rigged presidential election, was also invo l ved. The usual crowd in o ther words. Details of the document were published by the Su nday Herald in Scotland 6 and the c ontents precisely ~ mirror events instigated since Bush and h is controllers came to po wer. It is a blueprint for US (Illuminati) global domination that reveals how Bush and h is cabinet were planning to invade Iraq to secure 'regime c hange' even b efore they entered the White House in January 2001 . The PNAC report says: \"The United States has for decade s s ought to p laya more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the u nresolved conflict with Iraq p rovides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force p resence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.\" 7 Note that phrase \"provides the immediate justification\". This is why Bush, Blair, Powell and Co lied and lied and u sed bogu s \"inte11igeitce' ~ to d esperately make a . case for the war in Iraq. They d idn't have a reason, so t1'\\ey h ad to invent one, as they d id with Afghanistan, to follow the hidden agenda. Their first choice was 'weapon s of mass destruction', a term that was repeated ov er and ov er on the basis of the more times you say something the more people a re likely to b elieve you . As with 'Bin Laden d id it', there was no proof or even evidence, only constant repetition o f what they want the pub lic to b elieve (see Alice in Wonderland an d the World Trade Center Disaster for the Bin Laden b ackground ). When Hans Blix and his UN w eapon s inspectors found nothing to support the c laims abou t weapon s of mass destruction, Blair and Powell beca me e ver more desperate, detailing \"compelling intelligence\" that the weapon s existed. This I evidence' turned ou t to b e stolen virtually word for word from an analysis written 12 y ears earlier by a postgraduate student in California, but it was presented to· the pub lic a s the work o f British intelligence. It was lifted from an article by Ibrahim al Mirashi and even spelling and pun ctuation errors from the original were repeated. They d id, however, change words to· make them sound more sinister. Iraqi intelligence \"monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq\", beca me \"spying on foreign embassies in Iraq\". Even that is nothing more than the CIA and British Intelligence do themselves. \"Aiding oppo sition g roups in ho stile regimes\", was upg raded to \"supporting terrorist organizations in ho stile regimes\" .. I'm too sexy for my lies Andrew Gilligan, a BBC Defense and Diplomatic c orrespond ent, said h e had b een told by a significant source (later confirmed as British weapon s inspector, Dr David Kelly) that a dossier on the Saddam 'threat' was changed by Blair's office on the orders of his minder and Spinner-in-Chief, Alastair Campbell. 8 The intelligence report had no t been \"very revelatory\" when it arrived at Downing Street, Gilligan says Kelly told him, but it was\" transformed to make it sexier\". It was embellished to manipulate the people into suppo rting the war and included the outrageous claim that Saddam could d eploy weapon s of mass destru c tion in 45 minutes. Two o ther BBC reporters were told by Kelly in milder terms than the Blair press office (controlled by Campbell) changed the wording o f the dossier. Blair said the BBC story was\" as serious' an attack on my integrity as there c ould po ssibly b e\".9 But how can you attack something that does not exist? Campbell was 'cleared' of the 'sexing up' allegation by a c ommittee of MPs only on the c asting vote of the c hairman, a member of Blair's own Labou r Party. This was don e e ven though the c omm ittee ackno wledged that its work h ad b een \"hampered\" by the refusal to allow them access to intelligence papers and security services personn el! Hampered?? How can they make a decision abou t Campbell when they can't even interview1those invo lved? They h ave to take his word for it, basically. Outrageous. Campbell later announ ced h e was resigning as Blair's 'Mr Spin', but the manipu lation o f the public mind will continue beca use lies are e ssential to the c over story. ' Then came the strange death o f Dr Kelly, the source of Gilligan's report. He was 'outed' by Geoff Hoon 's Ministry o f Defence a fter he told them that he met Gilligan and could b e the source of the report that had caused the gov ernment to make c oncerted attacks on the BBC .

He was found in a secluded wood with his wrist cut and the official story was that he committed suicide a nd bled to d eath. The inference was that the pressure had made him do it. But this is the same David Kelly who face d the wrath o f the Sad d am regime a s a weapon s inspector after the 1991 Gulf War and coped with something similar fr om Russian o fficials during an investigation there. This guy could stand h is ground. Shortly b efore he left on h is 'suicide walk' he e mailed associates with \"combative\" comm ents abou t the pressure he was und er fr om \"many d ark actors playing g ames\". He said h e hop ed it would all blow over and h e c ould g et back to Baghd ad and g et on with the work that really mattered. When he left his home, his wife, Janice, was unconcerned. Although she knew her 59-year-old hu sband was deeply up set, his mental state did no t seem to b e too do wn. Walking was a hobby and h e often d isappeared for up to two o r three hou rs.

Me neither. Blair's Ministry o f Mendacity also said there was a link b etween Saddam and al-Qaeda until intelligence sources leaked the news that they h ad found no such conn ection. Intelligence professionals in the United States have taken a similar line. A group o f retired intelligence operatives s aid in a letter to President Bush: \"There is one unp ardonable sin. Cooking intelligence to the recipe of high p olicy. There is ample e vidence that this has been don e in Iraq.\" 11 A member of the Pentagon 's Defense Intelligence Agency told the New York Times: \"The American p eople-were manipulated.\" 12 Clare Short, who resigned as Blair's international development secretary in p rotest at the spin, said h e had misled the public over the scale of the threat posed by Iraq to ensure suppo rt for the war. \"I have c oncluded that the PM decided to go to war in Augu st sometime a nd h e dup ed u s all along\", she told the Sunday Telegraph. \"He had d ecided for reasons that he a lone kno ws to go to war over Ir aq and to create this s ense of urgency and d rive it - the way the intelligence was spun was part of that drive.\" 13 His reasons were to follow the a genda of his unseen masters who pu t him into power and can either keep h im there or cause his downfall. Short said that Blair secretly agreed with George Bush in the a utumn o f 2002 that they would invade Iraq the following spring \"come what may\".14 The secrecy that followed, in which even Blair's cabinet was kept out of the loop, hampered the planning for the a ftermath o f the war and h elped to p rodu ce the \"chaos and suffering\" that ensued, she said. Decisions were ~~ made in Blair's office in calls to President Bush, Short revealed, and in phon e c onv ersations between Blair's foreign po licy advisor, Sir David Manning and 1 J ~ National Security Advisor, Condo leezza Rice. Short said Blair had lied ~ bout wanting a second United Nations resolution suppo rting the invasion; he had lied by claiming that Iraq was \"an immediate threat to u s in 45 minutes\"; and h e lied that French President Jacques Chirac would v eto a second resolution under any circumstances. This was not true, said Short,15 Tony Blair lies more often and more obv iously than any o ther British politician o f modem times (despite the fierce c ompetition) and on e reason h e gets away with it is beca use it is beyond the c omprehension o f many that anyon e c ould lie so constantly and blatantly to the people he is suppo sed to serve. Well, he ca n and do es - every d ay. So do Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell and their cabal. They are following the techniques of the Nazis, as outlined by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf: \"All propaganda must be so po pular and on such an intellectual level that even the most stupid o f those toward whom it is directed will understand it. Peop le can be made to p erceive paradise a s hell, and the other way round, to consider the most wretched sort of life a s paradise.\" 16 In the United States, leaked information from the Department of Defense revealed that a top secret report by the Defense Intelligence Agency in September 2002 concluded they could find no evidence of chemical weapon s in Iraq. Some CIA officials distanced themselves from the Bush administration claims that Iraq posed an imminent threat. They said these c laims were based on information given directly to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld by Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the CIA-fund ed Iraqi National Cong ress and the man the Pentagon would like to b e leader of Ir aqi. More a bou t him later. Reports quo ted CIA sources as saying that Chalabi's 'information' was deeply suspect and largely b ased on hearsay from other defectors with v ested interests in regime c hange (they made it up). Bob Graham, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the media that classified evidence that suppo rted the Bush claims abou t Iraqi weapon s was made pub lic, but he said that as a member of the Intelligence Comm ittee he saw much evidence that didn't suppo rt its case. \"That evidence was never declassified\", he said. All this when the United States and Britain h ave ac cess to a satellite surveillance system that can read you r number plate from space and this is how the Airman magazine described the ca pabilities of the Global Hawk un manned surveillance plane deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq: \"On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake ~ , California. The images it gathered were so clear that an e lectro op tical image stands out next to a FA-18 Fighter. An infrared image showed where concrete h ad cooled d own from the shadow of a C-130 that had recently taken off.\" And they couldn't locate :weapon s of mass destruction'? Or find Bin Laden? Or Saddam Hussein? Fakes and fantasy Colin Powell and the United States claimed that a document existed to show that Niger had sold u ranium to Iraq for nuclear weapon s. This' document' was expo sed as a crude fake by the International Atomic Agency. Joseph Wilson, the US ambassador to Gabon from 1992 to 19 95, wrote in the New York Times how he had been h ired by the CIA to investigate the a lleged Niger conn ection and had found\" no evidence. He comm unicated h is findings to the US gov ernment and h e said:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 45 \"Based on my experience with the administration in the months leading up to the war, I have little choice bu t to conclude that some o f the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.”18 They lied. Powell told NBC : “It was the information that we had. We provided it. If that information is inacc urate, fine.” 19 No, darlin', it was information you made up to manipulate the people a nd that's not fine. Quite simply, you were c augh t lying, Mr. Powell, the e xpo sure of which is hardly b rain surgery. Remember how Powell presented h is 'evidence' to the United Nations Security Coun cil with his make-believe c harts, 'intelligence' satellite pho tographs and recordings of phone ca lls by Iraqi officials? All bullshit - and h e knew it. It was the same with the drone a ircraft that we were told could attack the East Coast of the United States. Pure invention to sell a lie. When Bush and Co were ca ugh t out on the 'Iraq nu clear plans' fabrication they arranged for the CIA chief, George Tenet, to take the blame to p rotect them. He said it had been a CIA “error” At the same time the Americans were distancing themselves from the 'nuclear' statements, Tony Blair was s till saying that the intelligence was correct. Mixed up the song sheets there then? Powell told the United Nations in February 2 003 that Saddam had authorised h is field comm anders to use c hemical weapon s. So why weren't they u sed when the US and Britain invaded? And why weren't the weapon s he a uthorised found when the Iraqi 'army' was overrun? The United States Army comm ander in Iraq said after the war that nothing h ad b een found to show the c oun try's milit ary was prepared to u se them on US forces. Lieutenant-General William Wallace , comm ander of the a rmy's 5th Corps, said US forces had un covered \"no evidence of him trying to employ them directly against US tr oop S” .20 Why the hell not? I thou ght Iraq's 'weapon s of mass destruction' were a threat to the world and y et they aren't even u sed to defend their own coun try from invasion and takeover? Powell was lying, as he was with h is claims that Saddam's weapon -making u nits were hou sed in trucks moving from place to p lace . It would b e laughable if the outcome of the mendacity h ad no t been so tragic for the people of Ir aq. Behind Powell when h e made his UN address were blue drapes hung that morning to cover a massive tapestry reprodu ction o f Picasso's famous anti-war painting called Guernica. The UN's Stephane Dujaric, said: “We needed the right background that would work on television.\" Yeah, OK . Powell also said that they h ad intelligence proof. that Saddam had weapon s of mass destruction, but could not give details for fear of expo sing the informants to d anger. Excuse me if I f ail to b elieve that people like Powell really give a damn abou t expo sing anyone to d anger so long as the a genda is se rved. And ho ld on. How w ould it expo se informants to d anger if the US had simply told the UN inspectors where to look? With Saddam's regime removed, there was no d anger at all to informants. So why didn't the Americans immediately follow their 'intelligence proof' and find the weapon s? Months after the war began, there was still nothing. The British cabinet minister, David Blunkett, is a former 'socialist' and no w, in my view, the most right wing Home Secretary o f modem times. He said even while the war was going on that no chemical, biolog ical or nuclear weapon s of mass destruction may b e foun d, and y et this was the 'justification' for the war. He said that, in any case, he rejoiced at the 'fall' of Saddam Hussein and his regime regardless of whether any weapon s of mass destruction were found in Iraq o r not. 21 Unbelievable. But I still would no t be surprised to see 'weapon s' of some kind 'found' once they h ave managed to ship them there! As the lies were e xpo sed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that Saddam m ay h ave destroyed the weapon s before the war started! Err, so why was there a war? Why d idn't Sad d am m ake this mass destruction v ery p ub lic to avoid b eing invaded? Rumsfeld's 'deputy' and the real power in the Pentagon , Paul Wolfowitz, told Van ity Fair that the claims abou t Sad d am's weapon s capability were used to justify the war for \"bureaucraticreasons\".22 It was \"the one \" reason everyon e c ould agree on\", he said. The other factor he described as \"hug e\" was that an attack would allow A merica to pu ll its troops from Saudi Arabia and resolve a major grievance held by al-Qaeda. Oh, so the 'war on terrorism' invo lves giving in to the alleged terrorists, then? What non sense. Pulling the troop s out of Saudi Arabia is part of a strategy that will eventually send them back in again to take the c oun try ov er. But the best excuse for not finding weapon s of mass destruction came, naturally, from George W. Bush. He said in his weekly radio address on Sund ay, June 22nd 2 003, that they h ad b een looted!! When the a lleged weapon s were not found in Iraq -or had no t yet been p lanted - it was claimed that the find ing o f mass graves were justification enough for the war. What they d idn't tell you was that those graves were overwhelming ly the result of uprisings being pu t down by Saddam after the 1991 Gulf conflict. These rebellions were the result of encouragement from President father George Bush, who then refused to suppo rt them and left the people to their fate - mass graves. Shooting the messenger The United Nation's Hans Blix said that American o fficials tried to discredit the work o f his weapon s inspectors in Iraq to further their own case for war. He told the BBC of his \"disquiet\" at how the documents the International Atomic Energy Agency \"had no g reat difficulty finding o ut were fake\", managed to g et"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 46 through US and UK intelligence a nalysis. Also disturbing, he said, was the question o f who was respon sible for the falsif ~ cation.23 As usual the fake documents to make the c ase for an Illuminati war did not\" get 'through US and UK intelligence a nalysis\"; they faked them in the first place , as per normal. After the c onflict the United States and Britain refused to allow Blix and UN inspectors to return to Iraq to search for the a lleged weapon s. Instead, the provided its own inspection teams. Blix called for experts 'to return to the c oun try to d etermine whether the weapon s allegations had any found ation. Are you k idding? Does he really think the c riminals in the US and British administrations are really go ing to allow him back to p rove they h ave been lying all along ? Tony Blair dismissed d emands from m embers of his own Labou r Party for an inqu iry into how the public was misled abou t Saddam's 'weapon s of mass destruction' that were c ited as the reason why the war was necessary. He kno ws a proper, truly independent inquiry, would expose his mendacity. Retired CIA intelligence a nalyst Ray McGovern, a member of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, said: \"Some o f my c olleagues are virtually c ertain that there will be some weapons of mass destruction found, even though they might have to be p lanted. I'm just as sure that some few w ill be found , but not in an amount that by any s tretch would justify the charge of a threat against the US or anyone e lse. Even if the planting was discovered b y and b y, they'll say, 'OK, the weapon were p lanted fine”. And remember: these genetic liars are the same people who h ave told the world what happened on September 11th, who did it, and ho w - the official story o f 9/11 that has been u sed to 'justify' all that has followed. The idea that the invasion was abou t 'liberating' Iraqis is a grotesque joke. They were so d esperate to sell the idea of an international 'coalition' that they included in their laugh able list of suppo rting coun tries the Solomon Islands and Tong a. The Solomon Islands doesn't even h ave a military! By March 30 th 200 3, Donald Rumsfeld was telling Fox [propaganda] News that the 'coalition' had no w ~ to 66 coun tries. It was simply another lie. Allan Kemakeza, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, said his coun try was not part of the c oalition,' despite being listed.25 The Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Rop said the same a nd Croatia was listed even though its president, Stipe Mesic, cond emned the war on Iraq as ~ -\"illegitimate\".26 The Czech Repub lic was listed when its president, Vaclav Klaus, said that anyon e who 'thinks democracy can b e imposed on Iraq is \"from another universe\".27 Or as investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen wrote in Coun ter Punch: \"Klaus mean s that people like Bush, Tony Blair, Rumsfeld a nd the o ther neo -Crusaders are just plain nuts. Indeed they are.\"28 But if you ha ven't got support, invent some. If you h aven't got an e nemy, invent one . Author Joseph Schumpeter said of the [Illuminati] Roman Empire: \"There was no comer of the known world where some interest was not alleged to be in danger or under actual attack. If the interests were not Roman, they were those o f Rome's allies; and if Rome had no a llies, the a llies would be invented.\" 29 The Bush message was: \"If you suppo rt us we a re going to war with Iraq, if you don't suppo rt us we a re going to war with Iraq.\" It’s the mentality o f the playground b ully. People have a sked why Bush and Blair would no t listen to arguments for allowing UN w eapon s inspectors more time to search for the a lleged 'weapon s of mass destruction' and took no acc oun t of-the Massive global protests or opinions of other gov ernments. The a nswer is that they were following the a genda of their unseen masters and no thing was going to divert them from that. They wouldn't dare. Inmates control the asylum Blair, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and their like, knew they were peddling false information for no o ther reason than to p rovide the \"imm ediate justification\" to move into the Gulf in line with the Illuminati's long-time strategy for global control. The Project for the New A merican Century report for the Bush cabal in September 2000 planned a \"blueprint for maintaining global US pre- eminence, preclud ing the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the international security o rder in line with American p rinciples and interests\".3O What it calls this \"American g rand strategy\" must be a dvanced for\" as far into the future a s possible\" and it says that the US must \"fight and d ecisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars\" as a \"core mission \",31 American armed forces are described as \"the cavalry on the new A merican frontier\".32 The report also said: Allies like the UK are \"the most effective and efficient means of exercising American . global leadership\" . Peacekeeping missions demand \"American po litical leadership rather than that of the United Nations\" .. Even should Saddam pass from the scene, bases Saudi Arabia a nd Kuwait will remain permanently, despite domestic oppo sition in the Gulf regimes to the stationing of US troop s, as \"Iran may well prove a s large a threat to US interests as 1raq has\", North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran a re d angerous re gi mes and their existence justifies the creation of a \"world-wide command-and-control sys tem\" [World Army] China should be targeted for \"regime change\" and"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 47 the report says \"it is time to increase the p resence o f American forces in Southeast Asia\" that may lead to \"American a nd a llied p ower providing the spur to the p rocess of democratisation in China\". \"US S pace Forces\" shou ld dominate space a nd it calls for the total control of cyberspace to p revent \"ene mies\" [anyone e xposing the ag enda] using the Internet against the US [Illuminati], \"The US should consider the u se o f biological weapons and that “new” methods of attack –electronic, ‘non- lethal’, biological – will be more widely available ... combat likely will take p lace in n ew dimensions, in space, cyberspace, and p erhaps the world o f microbes .. advanced form of biological warfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of the terror to a politically useful tool,.\" 33 Once a gain, note the language: \"specific genotypes\" - the biological targeting o f particular race s. Who said Hitler was dead? A major target for Illuminati genocide a re the black p eoples, especially o f Africa, and that is why the manufactured I Aids' plague has been v isited on that continent. I found it so sad that Live Aid's Bob Geldof could b e so n aive a s to p raise President Bush for helping Africa when the forces working through B u sh are determined to d estroy its people. The strings attached money Bush p ledged to \"fight Aids\" in Africa is a round o f drinks compared with the wealth stolen and extorted from that continent by the 'West' every y ear. The sick minds behind this biological warfare targeting \"specific genotypes\" are the same people who h ad the nerve to say that Iraq must be invaded b eca use it had b iolog ical weapon s or, as their Newspeak mantra puts it: ''Weapon s of mass destruction.\" The veteran Labou r Member of Parliament, Tam Dalyell, said o f the PNAC report: \"This is a b lueprint for US world domination - a n ew world order of their making. These a re the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world. I am appalled that a British L abour Prime Minister shou ld h ave got into b ed with a crew w hich has this moral stand ing.\" 34 But they are not fantasist Americans as such. They are fantasist initiates and p awns of the Illuminati that have place d their operatives in positions of power within the US gov ernment. Their focus is not with b eing American o r what is best for Americans, but with u sing that nation to p rogress the Illuminati agenda for th e g obal fascist state. The reason that Tony Blair is s o slavishly supporting the 'US' no matter . what happens is beca use he is also an Illuminati place man who is there to serve his hidden masters, just like Bush. Do as you are told, guys, and you'll be fine. Fail to d eliver and \"Houston, we have a problem\". They are far more terrified o f those ~ who control them than they are of the c onsequences in pu blic pop ularity. The Bush g roup 's blueprint for global domination summ arised abov e is clearly unfolding by the month with the Iraq ph ase und erway and Syria, Iran and North Korea a lready b eing targeted by the spinners who d emonise c oun tries as a prelude to invasion. The resistance they are facing in Iraq, however, is making their plans far more difficult and . the lack o f 'weapon s of mass destruction' has produ ced an increasingly sceptical public. Blair's credibility is in tatters. It's not as straightforward as they though t it was going to b e. People may find the mention o f China a s a target to b e a staggering sugg estion, but, as I have mentioned in my bo oks, talks and interviews for years, many d ifferent contacts have told me that it was all leading to a manipulated conflict with China. In my boo k, The Biggest Secret, pub lished two y ears before the Project for the New A merican Century do cument, I wrote: \" ... The p lan is to eng ineer events, real and staged to create enormous fear in the countdown years to 2012. This include s a p lan to start a ·third world war either by s timulating the Muslim world into a 'holy war' aga inst the. West or by using the Chinese to cause g loba l conflict. Maybe both.\" 35 A CIA scientist I met in 19 97 was only on e of many p eople who h ave told me that a c onflict with China is where the a genda is leading. They want a global war for the same reason they wanted the two in the 20th century. A global problem opens the way to a global solution - the c reation o f a world g overnment and army to \"prevent another war\". With the world economy in a ca tastroph ic state a fter such a conflict the way would b e open for a world central bank and currency to \"rebuild the financial system\". And, of course, we would need to microchip the people to p rotect them from the baddies. Who benefits from 9/11? Now w hat was the trigger for the 'war on terrorism'? What has been the found ation o f the c over story for global conqu est by what is nothing less than the Fourth Reich? Why, of course, it is the a ttacks of September 11th, which President Bush called \"Our Pearl Harbou r\". Welt well, well. The Project for the New American Century (PNA C) document, produced a year before 9/11, says that their blueprint for conqu est or their \"process of transformation\" was likely to b e long and slow\" absent some ca tastroph ic a nd catalyzing event -like a new Pearl Harbor\". And what happened at just the right moment to advance their plans dramatically? 9 /11. The American Free Press asked Christoph er Maletz, assistant director of the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 48 PNAC, what was meant by the need for\" a new Pearl Harbor\". He said they n eeded more money to increase the defense budg et for new arms and future capabilities. \"Withou t some disaster or catastroph ic event the politicians and the military w ~ have not have a pproved this\", Maletz said.36 Thanks to 9 /11, Cong ress allocated $40 billi on to fund the 'war ( on terrorism' and the 2002 military b udget alone was,$34 S.7 billion with further massive rises to come. This is exactly what the PNA C document called for and, beca use of 9/11 it is happening. Coincidence? Can a ~ hale fit in a matchbox ? In truth, this is not an 'American' agenda for global conqu est, that's just the c over to h ide the fact that what we a re seeing h appen is the Illuminati agenda that I, and many o thers, have been expo sing all these years. The United States is just their vehicle, that's all. They couldn't care less abou t those who call themselves American any more 'than they could those in any o ther coun try. Neither is the Project for the New American Century report just the work o f a few loony right-wing fanatics, as is claimed. It is a summ ary o f part of the Illuminati agenda a s it is planned to' ' procee d ov er the next few years. Look at the personn el of the PNA C and the network o f conn ecting o rganisations. They h ave become kno wn as 'neo-cons': Donald Rumsfeld (PNA C foun ding member): Defense Secretary in the 'war on terrorism', who is ensuring that the blueprint produced by his own o rganisation comes to p ass. Rumsfeld v isited Baghd ad in 1 983 to arrange for the shipment of chemical and biological weapon s Saddam Hussein from the Reagan-Bush administration and in 20 00 h e was on the board o f the European engineering company, ABB , when it suppli e d nuclear techno logy to North Korea. This is yet another example of the secret agenda a nd the movie running alongside eac h o ther. Rumsfeld was invo lved in supplying the 'problems' that the movie c ould later claim m ade ac tion n ece ssary against Iraq and North Korea. Paul Wolfowitz (PNAC found ing member): Deputy Defense Secretary, whom Bush calls \"Wolfie\". He is a far right suppo rter of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) - 'a \"think-tank that puts Israel and its s ecurity at the heart of US foreign p olicy\".37 Wolfowitz, who h as relatives in Israel, has also served as the Bush administration's liaison to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee a nd h as extremely close ties to the gov ernment of Israel. This is just the background you n eed to b e seen as impartial on Midd le East policy. Wolfowitz is the real power at the Pentagon , more so than Rumsfeld. Rarely is the person o fficially in charge the one who is really in control. Dick Cheney (PNA C foun ding member): Vice President and on the board o f advisors of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ijinsa. He was Defense Secretary to father George Bush du ring the 1991 Gulf War and h e's the real power in the White House behind the village idiot. Cheney was head o f the oil services giant, Halliburton, -from 1995 to 2 000 when the c ompany enjoyed contracts with Saddam Hussein's Iraq and worked with o ther terrorist dictatorships to line their pockets. Cheney is a very d isturbed entity indeed (see my o ther book s). Lewis Libb y (PNA C foun ding member): Chief of Staff to Cheney, close friend, confidant and p rotégé of Wolfowitz. He served in father George 13u sh's Defense Department and is closely conn ected with the Illuminati Rand Corporation, or companies, and the defense contractor, Northrop Grumm an, which, like the Rand Corporation, enjoys massive c ontracts with the Pentagon . Libby was a lawyer for conv icted felon and Israeli spy Mark Rich, who was pardon ed by Illuminati front. man and crook , Bill Clinton, in his last days as president. James Woolsey: another Jinsa member and former director of the CIA-from 1993 -95, who was apparently lined up to b ecome the minister of 'information' in the post-war Iraq. Can you imagine a CIA chief as minister for 'information'? Woolsey, a member of the US Policy Defense Board at the Pentagon , said h e believes the United States is going to b e involved for several deca des in h elping to \"change the face\" of the Midd le East.38 He a lso said: \"We will make a lot of people very n ervou s and we will hear, for example, the Mubarak regime in Egypt or the Saudi royal family thinking abou t the idea of these Americans spreading o f democracy in this part of the world. They will say you make us very n ervou s. Our respon se shou ld b e ... good .\" 39 Woo lsey studied at Oxford University b etween 1963 and 19 65 when h e was awarded an Illuminati Rhod es Scholarship (just like ~ ill Clinton).

A year later she\"n1.ade him Senior Director for Near East and North African Affairs, including Arab-Israel relations and American efforts to p romote \"peace a nd security\" in the region. Abrams is on the a dvisory bo ard o f the Media Research Center, an o rganization that oppo ses liberalism on television o r in films. Jo hn Negroponte : the Bush ambassador to the United Nations with a horrific history. He was a major aide to the US embassy in Vietnam from 1964, an advisor to the war criminal Henry Kissinger, and in charge of Vietnam policy on the US National Security Coun cil. In the 1980 s he ca rried ou t the c overt policy o f Reagan-Bush to d estroy the e lected Sandinista gov ernment in Nicaragua a nd in Hondu ras he a dministered a massive increase in US military suppo rt for the right-wing government. It soared from $4m to $77 m and the coun try b eca me kno wn as USS Hondu ras. Negropon te was also fund amentally invo lved with the infamous Battalion 3 -16 in Honduras that ran a terror campaign o f murder and torture a gainst the people. Richard Perle (PNAC found ing member): former Assistant Defense Secretary to Reagan-Bush, a leading member of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) and the c hairman o f the far-right American Enterprise Institute (AEI) on 17 th Street in Washington, which h as Cheney's wife, Lynn e, among its membership. Fourteen members of this AEI organisation are in the Bush cabinet and o thers are elsewhere in the a dministration. Bush told an AEI conference on February 26 th, 2003: \"At the American Enterprise Institute some of the finest minds in ou r nation are a t work in some of the greatest challenges to our nation. You do such good work that my administration h as borrowed 20 such minds.\"41 Perle has so many o f his associates in the Bush gov ernment that they are kno wn as the \"string o f Perles\".42 At the Pentagon , Perle was nicknamed the \"Prince of Darkness\" for his hard- ~ e beliefs and h e introduced a number of staunchly p ro-Israel activists who d ramatically increased weapon s sales to Israel. He is a former employee of an Israeli weapon s manufacturer, Soltam. Perle is a member of several other ~ -wing g roup s like the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (along with James Woolsey, the former CIA chief and member .9f the Project for the New A merican Century), and h e is referred to as the \"neo-cons political god father\". Perle is a former aide to on e-time Israeli premier, ·Benjamin Netanyahu, and in 1996 h e simultaneously advised bo th the Bob Dole ca mpaign in the United States and the Netanyahu campaign in Israel. Perle was also advisor to the lobby ing firm run by Douglas J . Feith, the Pentagon 's und er-secretary o f defense. Before the invasion o f Ir aq, Perle a dvised clients of the investment hou se, Goldman Sachs, abou t investment oppo rtunities in Iraq when the US was in control. He is a director of the software c ompany, Autono my Corp, which includes the Pentagon among its clients. Autono my says it expected its profits to increase dramatically after the war. Perle is a member of the Defense Policy Board that advises the Pentagon . Another member is Henry Kissinger, a major Illuminati operati v e of the last 40 y ears. Perle had to resign as chairman o f the Board when conflicts of-interest were expo sed. My god , how many? He resigned"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 50 after it was reported h e had worked as s consultant to the bankrupt telecomm un ications company, Global Crossing Ltd., which was trying to g et Pentagon approval to b e sold to Asian investors. The Los Angeles Times revealed that Perle briefed an investment seminar on ways to p rofit from the c onflict in Iraq and North Korea just weeks after he received a top-secret gov ernment briefing on the two coun tries.44 The Defense Intelligence Agency b riefing that Perle a ttended took place in February 200 3, the Times reported, and h e held his s eminar three weeks later. The Times further cited agendas of the meetings· and o ther ·documents to show that Perle a nd fellow advisers received a c lassified address abou t military comm unications s ystems. Perle runs Trireme Partners, a venture c apital firm that has been exploring such high-tech investments.45 \"The guiding p rinciple here is that you do no t give a dvice in the Defense Policy Board on any p articular matter in Which y ou h ave a n interest\", Perle said. \"And I don 't do that. I haven't don e that.\" 46 I think old Rich h as another guiding p rinciple, myself, although p rinciple is not the word that comes imm ediately to mind. Perle told the BBC : \"The President of the United States on issue a fter issue has reflected the views of neo-conservatives. I think h e c omes to h is view in his own way and through his own experience, but it happens to track v ery closely with the outlook o f neoconservatives, especially since 9/11.\"47 Firstly, Bush do esn't have a ny experience, nor a mind that could assimilate it; and second , the 'neo- cons' manipulated Bush into the presidency to front their agenda a nd h e does whatever they tell him. Michael Ledeen: Wow. Another member of the American Enterprise Institute a nd involved in the 1970s in the \"shadowy world o f right-wing Italian po litics\".48 Ledeen h as close ties to Henry Kissinger, the Illuminati 'Roman Catholic' front, Opus Dei, and the Italian P-2 Masonic Lodg e involving his as s ociate, Licio Gelli, a far, far, :right Illuminati operator (see And The Truth S hall Set You Free).49 As I mentioned earlier, Gelli, a Mussolini fascist and Knight of Malta, was the Grand Master of P-2. It was involved in the murder of the Italian p olitician, Aldo Moro, and o ther terrorist outrages by the so-called Red Brigade. P-2 and Gelli-were behind the Vatican b anking scandal featuring \"God's Banker\" Roberto Calvi who was silenced by b eing ritually murdered und er Blackfriars Bridge a t the e ntrance to the City o f London (And the Truth Sh all Set You Free has the background ). Francesco Pazienza, who is also reported to b e c lose to Michael Ledeen ,so was suspected o f setting up Calvi for murder and at the time of his death Calvi's family said h e was killed by Opus Dei. Gelli and Pazienza, both associates of Ledeen, were jailed for their crimes, but not before Gelli was invited to the inauguration ceremony for President Ronald Reagan, the pupp et for father George Bush, in 19 81. Gelli and P-2 were c losely conn ected with the Priory o f Sino, the secret society g oing b ack with the Knights Templar to the 12th century and d edicated to the a dvancement of the Merovingian (big-time Illuminati) blood line (see The Biggest Secret). When the Italian authorities raided Gelli's Roman villa in 1 ~~ 1, they found files listing members of affiliated secret societies that formed a “cabal within a ca bal”. These included Opus Dei with its thou sands of initiates worldwide a nd the membership lists of the Knights Templar. Among the P-2 members was the c urrent Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi. Surprised? No, nor me. This is the real background to those now controlling the American and British governments on the 'war on terrorism'. Michael Ledeen also h ad secret meetings with the Israeli government in the 1980s that led, \"inadvertently\" he says, to the Iran-Contra gun s for drugs affair coordinated through the Reagan-Bush White House. 51 Now, since 9/11, as the BBC reported, Ledeen's \"shadowy n eo-con talents are back in favou r\".52 In 2001, Ledeen was co-chair of the US - China Econo mic and Security Review Commission. This is s ignificant given the neo-Nazi plan for a c onflict with China. Ledeen says: \"All the great scholars who h ave studied the American ch aracter have come to the conclusion that we are a war-like people. We love war.\" 53 He talks of the need to \"free\" Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Libya a nd North Korea a fter the invasion o f Ir aq. \"No-one would h ave imagined that the United States could, and maybe should, consider France a nd Germany as s trategic e nemies\", he said, \"and y et they h ave behaved no w for several months as if they are strategic e nemies.\" Ledeen, who h as a model of Darth Vader on his desk, naturally says he is a student of the a rch manipulator Machiavelli and his attit ude was encapsulated by this remark: \"Richard [Perle] says he doesn't think Americans are vind ictive. Well I hop e he's wrong .\" 55 Jim Lobe of the Inter Press Service in Washington h as been compiling files on the 'neo-cons' since ~ the 1970 s when h e realised ho w influential they could b e. He says of Michael Ledeen: \"Peop le were very s urprised to see that of the [very few] people who Karl Rove, Bush's c losest advisor, ... talks to ... t hat are knowledgeab le in foreign affairs ... one o f them is Michae l Ledeen a nd that will be a cause for sleep less nights for many peop le I would think. He is a p rovocateur and h e's written more than once that the thing he really dislikes about the foreign policy establishment is that it thinks in terms of stability rather than revolution and radical change. \" 56 As Ledeen told the UK Daily Telegraph: \"Undermining the gov ernments of other coun tries?

Michael Joyce: the former president of the massively influential Bradley Foundation that created The Project for a New A merican Century. It has also p rovided milli ons in funding for the PNAC, the American Enterprise Institute a nd a long list of other neo- ~ on o rganisations and authors .

Joyce c laims to b e a \"moral guardian\" of American family v alues and h e is an advisor to Americans for Victory ov er Terrorism, a group that wants to p revent criticism of American milit ary p olicy.

Joshu a Muravchik : a member of the American Enterprise Institute who h as no p roblem with a devastating war on the Korean p eninsular, so long as, like the rest of these sad p eople, they don 't have to take part themselves. Muravchik told the BBC that removing the \"nuclear threat\" of North Korea\" ... might include having to try to d estroy it by military strikes.\" He said such a war would b e \"far worse than in Iraq, it'd b e a war in which thou sands arid thou sands of Koreans would die a nd maybe thou sands of Americans as well\".

He organised the formation o f the Project for the New American Century, of which h e is chairman, on b ehalf of the Bradley Found ation. With this background, no wond er he is a political 'pund it' on Murdoch's Fox/Fix News. He is chairman o f the New Citizenship Project that conn ects with the Project for the New A merican Century. It claims to b e a non -profit, \"educational\" organization p romoting American global leadership. Kristol told the BBC : \"American po wer should no t just be used in d efense of American interests, but for the promotion o f American p rinciples ... we are going to have to b ring d0wn a series of regimes who are spon sors of a network o f various terrorist organisations.\" 62 He names them as Iran, Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and North Korea was this not a tyranny to expand the c ontrol of America? \"No\", said Kristol, \"lli1J abou t freedom and d emocracy, not abou t capitalism.\" \"No\", said Icke, it is abou t global conquest for the Hidden Hand. Kristol, like Perle, says that their ideolog ical pood le in London, Tony Blair, is a \"kind o f neo-conservative\". 63 Kind o f?? Kristol said the mass killing in Iraq was\" the e nd o f the beginning o f this part of the war, it is not the e nd o f the e nd\".64 They. would give Iraq a new gov ernment \"and then really work to remove other dictators with weapon s of mass destruction\". The neo-cons - neo-Nazis - say that democracies (tyrannies in which you can cast a meaningless vote) don 't harbou r international terrorists. But what abou t the White House a nd Downing Street for a start? Kristol runs the Rupert Murdoch-financed Weekly Standard in Washington, five floors below the American Enterprise Institute . The publication slavishly supports the Bush and Israel line. A regular contributor to the paper is J ohn Bolton, the Iraq war manipulator, who loves to attack UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Others include Perle, Wolfowitz, Feith and Woolsey. In 199 8, it was Kristol, Bolton, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Khalilzad, Bennett, Woolsey, Perle a nd current Deputy Secretary o f State, Richard Armitage, who signed a letter calling on President Bill Clinton to instigate military action ~ Iraq.66 What a bun ch these are a nd they are\" running ou r world on b ehalf of forces we never see.

For Egypt, t oo, the h orizon has to be liberal democracy:\" 67 "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 52 Richard Perle, one of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's closest advisers and a vocal advo cate of war against Iraq, has also pu blicly qu estioned the \"reliability\" (we intend to invade) of long-time US ally, Saudi Arabia.68 As I said in Alice in Wonderland a nd the World Trade Center Disaster, Saudi Arabia has long been a pupp et state of the US, but I felt there were plans to move in eventually and take c omplete c ontrol, as with Iraq. While I was writing this chapter, the United States announ ced it was withdrawing most of its troop s from Saudi Arabia. You can b et this is part of a strategy that will include the demonisation o f Saudi Arabia a nd the return o f the troop s to take over the c oun try and its oil. As per usual, terrorist bombs exploded in Saudi Arabia killing many p eople just before Colin Powell was due to arrive, providing the backdrop o f devastation that he c ould exploit with his 'war on terror' propaganda. In the predictable style of manipulators, William Kristol seeks to p resent everything as black and white. You are J ~ 1ilier with u s or for the terrorists, and so on . He told Haa retz that the c hoice was between\" extremist Islam, secular fascism or democracy\", and b eca use of September 11 th h e said, \"Americans und erstood that\". No, America has been told that over and ov er by p eople like Kristol since those planes s truck the twin towers. \"America is in a position where it . has no choice\", Kristolludicrously said. \"It is obliged to b e far more a ggressive in promoting d emocracy, hence this war.\" For\" democracy\" read\" American control\". He c laimed that this policy was based on the new A merican und erstanding that if the United States does not shape the world in its image, the world will shape the United States in its own image. Once a gain we see that the whole found ation for the justification o f this fascist expansionism of the Fourth Reich is believing the official story o f the a ttacks that happened on September 11th to b e true. But it is not; t he official story is a lie. Who told u s what happened, who d id it, how they did it, and why? The same forces that are using their false version o f the story to follow their long-planned agenda for global conqu est. Charles Krauthamm er, a columnist for the Washington Post, Time, and Kristol's Weekly Standard, is close to the Project for the New American Century and h e took the same line in his interview w ith Haaretz: \" ... the sea-change ... t ook place h ere on September 11, 2001. Since that morning, Americans have understood that if they don't act now. and if weapon s of mass destruction rea ch e xtremist terrorist organizations, millions of Americans will die. Therefore, because they understand that those o thers want to kill them by the millions, the Americans prefer to take to the field o f battle a nd fight, rather than sit idly by and d ie a t home.\" 69 The familiar technique of fr ightening the people into acquiescence is all based on the a cceptance that the official story o f 9 /11 is what really h appened. The situation is presented as open and shut, black and white, no midd le groun d, no room for debate. As always, there is the \" Americans have und erstood\", \"Americans kno w\", when the truth is that is s imply what people like Krauthamm er, Kristol, Murdoch, Perle, Rumsfeld, Powell, Cheney and Bush h ave told them. The New York Times columnist, Thomas Friedman, said: \"Is the Iraq war the g reat neoconservative war? It's \"the war the n eoconservatives wanted. It's the war the neo conservatives marketed. Those p eople had an idea to sell when September 11 th came, and they s old it. Oh bo y, did they s ell it. So this is not a war that the masses demanded. This is a war of an e lite. I could g ive you the na mes of 25 p eople (all of whom are a t this moment within a five-block radius of this office) who, if you had exiled them to a desert island a year and a half ago, the Iraq war would not have happened.\"70 Khalid Saffuri of the Islamic Institute said o f the nee-con cabal: \"They are a disaster for this coun try and many members of Cong ress believe that, but they .don 't dare say it. They'll take on everyon e, it's like a gang, you k now, it's like a Mafia.\" 71 Syria's deputy US ambassador, Imad Moustapha said: \"Sometimes they are really terrifying in way they think, the way they would like to shape the world, the way they can impose their doctrine on everyon e e lse, even if force is needed.\" 72 Moustapha said h e was not worried abou t them implementing their po licies beca use of Syria’s friends and allies. Oh, Imad. Look again, mate. A former US ambassador and White House a ide said: \"This bunch o f interlopers who've. latched on to George are stark, staring bonk ers. Their policies are insane.\" 73 And Arthur Schlesinger, the historian and former special assistant to President Kennedy, also referred to them as \"lunatics\": \"They lack any d ece nt respect for the opinions of the rest of mankind; and cast themselves as the world's jury, judge a nd executioner in deciding which coun try to attack, which p eople to bo mb.\" 74 SOUR CES 1 \"USA : Unocal Advisor Named Representative to Afghanistan-.

Abraham Lincoln Six months before the invasion o f Ir aq, journalist Brian Whitaker reported in the UK 's Guardian newspaper that an Israeli ' ~ tank', the Institute for Advanced Strategic a nd Political Studies, had p roduced a document in 1996 called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm. The document was written for the incoming Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu, an aide to whom was that constantly recurring n ame, Richard Perle, who is now at the heart of the Bush administration's plans for the c onqu est of the Middle East and ~ north Africa (except for Israel). The document advised the rightwing Netanyahu to adop t a new strategy ''based on 'an entirely n ew intellectual found ation, one that restores strategic initiative a nd p rovides the nation the room to engage e very po ssible e nergy on rebuilding Zion ism\".2 It called for Israel to abandon any p olicy o f trading land for peac e with the Arabs because this, it said, was\" cultural, econo mic, po litical, diplomatic a nd military retreat\". The Clean Break was a virtual replica of the blueprint produced four years later for the incoming Bush administration by the Project for the New American Century. This is no surprise when you realise that the a uthors of the two do cuments were pretty much the same a nd they are now at the heart of the Bush gov ernment. I wi1llook further at the Clean Break document and its authors s hortly, but first there a re some e xtremely important points to make a bou t the re-writing o f history with relation to Israel and o ther informat16.rt ,he-neo-con manipulators wish to supp ress. For example, the Clean Break paper makes this assertion: \"Our claim to the land - to which we ha ve Clung for hope for 2,000 years - is legitimate and noble. Only the unconditional acceptance b y Arabs of our rights, especially in their territorial dimension, 'peace for pea ce'; is a solid ba sis for the future.\" 3 It turns out, however, to b e a nything bu t legitimate a nd no ble. The Zionist\" claim to the land o f Israel is based on Old Testament texts, the true a uthorship o f which is unkno wn. Put simply: \"God g ave the 'Promised Land' to u s, his 'chosen p eople', and so the land is ours.\" Er, that's it. But it gets even more insane. As s ome brave Jewish writers like Arthur Koestler 4 have c onfirmed, the overwhelming majority o f 'Jewish' people, and certainly those that control Israel and 'advise' Bush, have no h istorical conn ection at all to the land o f Israel. They are not genetically Jewish and they are c ertainly no t 'Semites'!! They don 't originate from Biblical Israel, but from a people ca lled the Khazars in what became southern Russia down to the Caucasus Moun tains. This is why the so-called 'Jewish no se' is not a genetic trait of Israel, but the Caucasus! Alfred M. Lilienthal, a former American State Department official, called these facts \"Israel's Achilles heel\", beca use it destroys Zion ist claims to the land o f the Biblical Hebrews. 5 Historians believe the Khazars to b e descendents of the Turkik tribe kno wn as the Huns or Hun that invaded and savaged Europe from Asia a round 450 AD . The Huns' territories s tretched at one time from Central Asia to Central Europe, from Siberia a nd China to North India. They were a grouping o f tribes and b loodlines from the interbreeding with many p eoples, includ ing the Chinese a nd the Sumerians. The Huns are best remembered for their leader, Attila the Hun, who seized po wer by k illi ng his brother, Buda, after whom the Hung arian city o f Budapest was named. Like the Huns, the Khazars spok e the Turkik langu age a nd are believed to b e the same people. The Khazars controlled a large a nd po werful 'Pagan' empire ac ross most of Russia to the Ural Moun tains in the East and the Caucasus Moun tains in the south and they made their living as ••. - ~ traders and 'middlemen', levying taxes on the good s carried on the trade routes through their lands. Their influence in Eastern Europe e xtended well into the c oun tries we now kno w as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hung ary, Romania a nd Bulgaria (Figure 7, overleaf). The Khazars were phallic worshippers and eng aged in hu man sacrifice rituals. In a series of wars, the first from 642 to 6 52 AD , and the second from 722 to 739 AD , some 300,000 Khazar warriors prevailed against invading Muslims. They saved Russia a nd Eastern Europe for Christianity, which h ad also b een d efended on o ther fr onts by the a rmies of Charles Martel (\"the Hamm er\"), the leader of the Merovingian Franks.

Legend says that King Bulan was told to do this in d reams or visions, but it was clearly a political move to avoid b eing absorbed by the Christian o r Islamic world on either side. What is for certain is that the Khazars, the a ncestors of at least 90 p er cent of those ca lling themselves 'Jewish' today, had no thing whatsoever to do with the land called Israel. Their home was not the Dead Sea, but the Caspian Sea, which b eca me kno wn as 'The Khazar Sea'. This is the a rea targeted by the Illuminati today for its immense oil and g as reserves. Arthur Kessler writes that a \"warrior nation o f Turkish Jews must have seemed to the rabbis as strange a s a c ircumcised u nicorn\".6 There were, apparently, two streams of Khazar kno wn as the Kara or \"black\" .Khazars and the Ak o r \"white\" Khazars, although Arthur Koestler says this may no t have been related to the c olour of their skin. But an Arab Chronicler, Said al-Maghribi, wrote: “As to the Khazars, they are to t h e n orth of the inhab ited Earth towards the 7 th clime, having over their hea d s the constellation of the Plough. Their land is c old and wet. Accordingly their complexions are white, their eyes blue, their hair flowing and predominan tly reddish, their bodies large and their natures c old.

The Khazar Sumerians "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 57 The Khazars and their close a ssociates and subo rdinates, the Magyars, were related to the Sumerians, a people that will become increasingly important in this s tory as we progress. The Sumerians were said to b e the first settlers of southern Mesopo tamia a bou t 5,000 BC and came from ~ e moun tainous regions to the North and East. There they bu ilt what hist9rians call \"the c radle of civilisation \" an ~ an Empire that stretch e d in all directions, including no rth o f the Caucasus Moun tains where the Khazars were to d evelop their own empire a nd h ave their mass 'conv ersion' to the Jewish faith. It was believed that the Magyars were a nomadic people from the north with a language of Finn ish-Ugrian o rigin. But Dr Sando r Nagy writes in The Forgotten Cradle of the Hung arian Culture,9 that the people who later beca me kno wn as Magyars were Sumerians ·that were pushed ou t of the Fertile Crescent of what is now Iraq. Dr Nagy u ses extensive examples to confirm the linguistic similarities between the Sumerian, Old Magyar and the c urrent Magyar language. He a lso refers to several works written du ring the first millennium including the Arpad Codices and the De Administrando Imperio, and completed 50 y ears of his own research. He says that that while there are only two hund red Magyar words related to the Finno -Ugric language, there a re over two thou sand words related to the Sumerian. British, French and German archaeologists and linguists concluded that the language of ancient. Sumerian inscriptions was not· Indo -European no r Semitic, but a langu age which demonstrated significant similarities with the group o f languages kno wn at the time a s the Turanian ethno - linguistic group that included Hung arian, Turkic Mongo lian and Finnic (later referred to as the Ural-Altaic group );10 Research has indicated that the Sumerian-Hung arian languages have over a thou sand comm on word roots and are very similar gramm atical structure. Kalman Gosztony, professor of Sumerian ph ilology at the Sorbonn e, demonstrated in Sumerian Etymological Dictionary and Comparative Gramm ar that the structure of the Hung arian language is the c losest to that of the Sumerian. Of the 53 characteristics of Sumerian g ramm ar, 51 matched in the Hung arian, compared with 29 in the Turkic languages, 24 in the Caucasian, 21 in the Uralic languages in the Semitic langu ages and 4 in the Indo -European. The linguistic similarities b e tween Sumerian, Hung arian and o ther languages are c onfirmed by the a rchaeological and anthropological evidence, Dr Sando r Nagy says there were two separate migrations of the Sumerian p eople out of the Mesopo tamia one through Turkey to the Carpathian Basin and the other went east and then no rth across the Caucasus Moun tains into the a rea between the Caspian and Black Seas. This was the land occupied by the Khazar Empire to such an extent that the Caspian b eca me kno wn as the Khazar Sea. The Khazars were descended from the Huns and the Huns are said to b e descended, like the Magyars, from the Sumerians. An ancient pre-Christian traditional acc oun t of Hung arian o rigins s ays they are the descendents of Nimrod (the legendary found er of Babylon), the son o f Cush. The legend claims that Nimrod and Eneth had twp sons, Magor and Huno r. It is s aid that Magor was the ancestor of the Magyars and Huno r was the ancestor of the Huns, so p roviding the c omm on o rigin o f the Magyars and the Huns (Khazars). Ancient Byzantine sources say the Magyars were a lso called the Sabirs and o riginated from Mesopo tamia, the land of Sumer. Numerous other ancient and medieval sources refer to the Scythians, Huns (Khazars), Avars and Magyars as the same peoples, even thou gh the Hung arian authorities appear desperate to d eny this. In previous books I have highlighted the movement of the former Sumerians through the Caucasus Moun tains und er different names, like the Scythians. Now we have further confirmation o f the importance of the Caucasus region where, as again I have e mphasised b efore, some highly significant ill 1erbreeding o ccurred between b loodlines from Sumer and those from the Far East and China. This Caucasian Chinese-Turkish combination p rodu ced v ery important bloodlines from the Illuminati's point of view. A w riter on a Jewish website, using the name 1m nin'alu, says: \"The Huns' origin is directly c onne cted with two well-known p eoples of the ancient Middle East: t he Sumerians and the Scythians, namely, in the kingdom founded b y Nimrod. Even though they belong to the Japhe tic $stock and their most creditable an ces t or is Magog, the Sumerian h eritage ha s been kept by them more than b y any other people, which implies that they are in fact the result of a mixed ba ckground. According to their own legend r y accoun ts (legends that are anyway founded on true facts), it is very feasible that they k ept close ties with Sumerians even for a long time' after the Sumerians disappe a red from Mesopo tamia a s a nationa l entity. Their particular link with an cient Sumerians was found through the comparison of modern Hungarian (Magyar) and o ther related languages with documents of the ancient Middle East that revealed a po ssible common origin. \"The an cient Sumerians, that in the d awn o f history s ettled in Southern Mesopo tamia, in the land comm only known a s Shin'ar or Chaldea, arrived there from the north, precisely from the Ararat region [now Turkey], that they c alled 'Subar- Ki' or 'Subar-Tu'. This area was also named a fter one of the peop les that inhabited there, the Hurri, whose language was agglutinative like Sumerian and had many words in comm on, even being a totally different tong ue. Modern Hungarian shares many terms with both Sumerian a nd Hurrian, as well as with Elamite.\" 11 The real exodus "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 58 The Khazar Empire, the first feudal state in Eastern Europe, broke up in a series of wars and invasions culminating in the a rrival of the Mong ol 'Golden Horde', b est remembered for their inspiration, Genghis Khan. Over the ce nturies of w ~ power and influence, the Khazar peoples began to emigrate in many directions. S.W. Baron said o f Khazaria in A Social and Religious History o f the Jews: \"Its popu lation was largely absorbed b y the Golden Horde which had e stablished the centre o f its empire in Khazar territory. But before and after the Mongol 'uphea val the Khazars s ent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic land s, helping u ltimately to bu ild up the g reat Jewish centres of Eastern Europe.\" 12 Khazars took their Judaistic or Talmud ic faith and settled in many East European and Alpine lands, especially Poland-Lithuania. There are many ancient place names in Poland and the Ukraine inspired by the name \"Khazar\" or \"Zhid\", a term m eaning Jew. 13 These include Kozarzewek, Kozara, Kozarzow and Zydo wo. As the Khazar Empire c ollapsed in the period after 960 , a number of Slavon ic tribes, led b y, the Polans, formed an alliance that became the state ca lled Poland. 'Jews' (Khazars) played an important role in the Polish legends abou t the formation o f the c oun try. One says that a 'Jew' called Abraham Proko wnik was elected by the tribes to rule them. 14 Certainly Khazar 'Jews' became pro1llinent in many coun tries of Eastern Europe. Arthur Koestler writes: \"Both the Hungarian a nd Polish sources refer to Jews employed a s mintmasters, administrators of the royal revenue, controllers of the salt monopoly, tax-collectors and 'money-lenders' - i.e., bankers. This parallel sugge sts a comm on origin of those two imm igrant comm unities; and a s we can trace the origins of the bulk of Hungarian Jewry to the Magyar-Khazar nexus, the conclusion seems s elf-evident.\" 15 Koestler points out that the traditional garb o f Polish Jewry is of unmistakably Eastern o rigin - \"The skull- cap (yarmolka) is worn to this day by o rthodox Jews and by the Uzbeks and o ther Turkish p eople in the Soviet Union\" ~ What happened in this period is that the people formerly k nown for centuries as the Khazars beca me kno wn simply as 'Jews' and their true origin was lost. In its place their leaders sold to them - and the rest of the world - a false history. This was the belief that they were the Biblical Jews and the fallacy continues to this day with d evastating' consequences for peace in the Middle East. The Khazar 'Jews' were confined to ghettos as a \"result of Papal dictat in the mid-16th century and this, together with the17th century Cossack (ironically) massacres in the Ukraine, led to another mass exodu s into Hung ary, Bohemia, Rumania a nd Germany. There were hardly any Jews in Germany un til this time. 16 \"Thus the great trek to the West was resumed\", says Koestler, \"It as to continue through n early three centuries until the Second World War, and b ecame the principle source of the e xisting Jewish communities in Europe, the United States and Israel.\" 17 So what does all this mean for the official history o f the Jewish p eople? Koestler, who was himself born in Budapest, writes: \" ... [It] would mean that the ir ancestors c ame not from the Jordan, but from the Volga, not from Canaan bu t from the Caucasus, once believed to be the cradle of the Aryan race; and that genetically they are more closely c onne cted to the Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to the seed o f Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Shou ld this turn ou t to be the case, then the term 'anti-Semitism' would be void of meaning; based on a misapp rehension shared b y both the killers and their victims. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it slowly emerges from the past, beg ins to look like the most cruel hoa x which h istory has ever perpetrated.\" 18 Benjamin H. Freedman was a o ne-time Jewish·businessman in New York and a long time 'insider' before spea king ou t vociferously against Zionism after World War Two. He was personally acqua inted with lead ~ American political figures like Bernard Baruch, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy and John F. Kennedy. Freedman went much further in h is assessment of the Khazar revelation : \"What are the facts abou t the Jews? (I call them Jews to you, because they are known a s J ews, I don't call them Jews myself. I refer to them as s o-called Jews, because I know w hat they are.) ., ..

And yet they c ome to the Christians and a sk us to supp ort their armed insurrections in Palestine b y s aying, 'You want to help repatriate God's Chosen Peop le to their Promised Land , their ancestral home, don't you? It's y our Christian du ty. We g ave you o ne of our boys as y our Lord a nd Saviour ... It is as ridiculous to call them 'people of the Holy Land,' as it would be to call the 54 million Chinese Moslems 'Arabs' .... \" 19 The former Khazar people a re kno wn as the Ashkenazi Jews (plural Ashkenazim) and some Writers estimate that perhaps 90% to 95 % of those c alling\" themselves 'Jewish' worldwide a re a ncestors of the Khazars.

The name Ashkenazi is s aid by some to originate from Ashkenaz, the Hebrew w ord for Germany. In fact, the Bible refers to the Ashkenaz a s a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 59 people living in the region o f Mount Ararat (now Turkey) and Armenia. That would certainly fit the basic location o f the Khazars. 20 There is also a Biblical reference to Ashkenaz, brother of Togarma a nd nephew of Magog . 21 Joseph, the Khaiar King in the second h alf of the tenth century, wrote in correspond ence that they were a ncestors of Togarma, who, he said, had ten sons that seeded all the Turkish tribes, includ ing the Huns, Khazars and Bulgars. In the centuries after the demise of Khazaria, the Ashkenazi as a people did not speak the Semitic langu age . of Hebrew, which is no surprise a t all beca use they are not Hebrews. They d eveloped their own tongu e called Yiddish. This began as a Germanic langu age from south eastern d ialects of Middle High German and expanded into central and Eastern Europe starting in the 12th century. Later it evolved to include e lements of Hebrew, Aramaic, Slavic langu ages and o ther influences. Once a gain, Yidd ish, the langu age of the Ashkenazi, did no t come from Israel, but Eastern Europe.22 Heading \"home\" It was the Ashkenazi (Khazar) 'Jews' who were persecuted by the Rothschild controlled Nazis in Germany in the 20th century, a persecution that led to the suppo rt for a 'Jewish' homeland in Israel. It was on the spurious historical claim that these people originated from Israel and that 'God' had p romised them the land, that the House of Rothschild (A s hkenazim/Khazars) orchestrated the takeover of Palestine that has set the Midd le East ablaze with v iolence e ver since (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free for much more on the Rothschilds' invo lvement). The Balfour Declaration in 19 17, in which the British Foreign Secretary g ave his government's s uppo rt for a 'Jewish' homeland in Palestine, took the form of a letter fr om Lord Balfour to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild. The letter was in fact drafted by Lord Rothschild and h is employee, the banker, Alfred Milner. It said: \"His Majesty's Government view w ith favour the e stablishment in Palestine o f a na tional home for the Jewish p eople, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the a chievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be d one which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing no n- Jewish comm unities in Palestine, or the rights and po litical status enjoyed b y Jews in an y other country.\" 23 What a sick joke the bit abou t the c ivil and r e ligious rights of the non -Jewish communities turned ou t to b e. One of the most important secret societies within the Illuminati web is called the Round Table. It is based in Britain with b ranches across the world, and it is the Round Table that orchestrates the network o f the Bilderberg Group, Coun cil on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission and the Royal Institute of International Affairs detailed in my o ther books. How fas c inating then, that Lord Balfour was an inner circle member of the Round Table; Alfred Milner was the Round Table's official leader after the death o f its found er, Cecil Rhod es; and the Round Table was fund ed by ... Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild. These were the very three people involved in the Balfour Declaration. Two y ears later, in 1 919, .came the Versailles Peace Conference near Paris when the e lite of the Round Table from Britain and the United States, people like Alfred Milner, Edward Mandel House a nd Bernard Baruch, were a ppo inted to represent their coun tries at the meetings that decided ho w the world would b e c hanged as a result of the war these same people had engineered. They decided to impose impossible reparations payments on Germany, so ensuring the c ollapse of the post-war Weimar Repub lic a mid unbelievable ec ono mic c ollapse a nd thus create the very circumstances that brough t Hitler and the Nazis to po wer. It was at the Versailles conference that these Illuminati front men agreed to suppo rt the c reation o f a Jewish ho meland in Palestine a nd every on e of them was either a Rothschild bloodline or controlled by them. Today it is s till the same. The Rothschilds are extremely close to p eople in 'power' like the Bushes, Hillary Clinton, British royal family, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Peter Mandelson, the long-time Blair 'guru'. Evelyn d e Rothschild and his wife, the American-born businesswoman, Lynn Forester, spent their wedding night at the White House a t the invitation 'of Bill and Hilary Clinton and Lady d e Rothschild h as publicly stated h er suppo rt for Blair and his Labou r Party. This includes fund raising. She says s he is a suppo rter of 'Third Way' politics, the \"balance\" (it claims) between Left and Right. 24 The Third Way is actually an example of the Illuminati technique ca lled the Hegelian Dialect when you playoff one e xtreme a gainst another and fuse them together. Zionism is a political movement, not a people Zion ism was the c reation o f the Ashkenazi/Khazar leadership, especially the House of Rothschild. What most people don 't realise is that Jewish p eople a nd the political movement called Zionism are not the same thing. It is like saying the Repub lican Party in the United States is the American n ation o r Blair's Labou r Party is the Biitish n ation. Large numbers of Jewish p eople a re deeply op posed to the goals and claims of Zion ism, but their views don 't get reported. An example is the Neturei Karta movement, a grouping o f Jewish p eople ca mpaigning to expo se the truth abou t Zionism. Their spok esman, Rabbi Ahron Cohen,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 60 issued a statement to members of the UK parliament saying that they expressed\" a religious and I humanitarian p hilosophy h eld in essence by large numbers (hund reds of thou sands) and po ssibly the majority o f \"authentic Orthodox Jews\".

Rabbi Cohen cond emned the practical outcome of Zionism \"in the form of the State kno wn as Israel\" as \"completely alien to Judaism and the Jewish' Faith\". It had b een, and continued to be, the ca use of untold suffering and bloodshed, both Jewish and non -Jewish: \"The a pparent connection between Judaism and Zionism is false. The connection has been n urtured b y the Zionists in o rder to en snare a s many J ews as possible within their net.\" 26 Many will be surprised at those words because we only h ear in the media from Zionist fronts like the Anti- Defamation League, which, in true Orwellian fashion, spends its time defaming p eop le, including me. Is the Illuminati agenda a Jewish p lot, as s ome c laim? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. But, is the political movement called Zionism involved? Absolutely it is. See the articles by Henry Makow, whose family suffered und er the Nazis, for more background to this;27 and the works of Jewish writers s uch as Israel Shamir2 8 and Norman Finkelstein.29 The Zionists are furious when such p eople speak ou t because they canno t credibly acc use them of being anti-Jewish o r 'anti-Semitic' - the usual defense against expo sure. Finkelstein, the New York-born son o f concentration camp survivors, says that Jewish o rganisations are \"huckstering \" the Holocaust by extracting huge sums in compensation through the Zion ist-controlled 'Claims Conference' and other agencies that the survivors never see. He says his father received compensation from the German gov ernment totalling $2 50,000, yet his mother's compensation, channelled through American Jewish organisations, came to a total of just $3,500 and no p ension.30 \"What they <have don e, by turning the central tragedy o f Jews in the 20th century into.-weap6n for shaking do wn p eople for money is pretty disgusting; it's wretched\", he said. 31 Finkelstein writes: \"The reported annual salary of Saul Kagan ['Kagan' was the na me for the Khazar king] long-time Executive Secretary of the Claims Con ference is $105,000. Between stints at the Conference, Kagan was c onvicted o f 33 coun ts of wilfully misapp lying fund s and credit while h eading a New York ban k. (The conviction was overturned on ly after multiple appeals.) Alfonse D'Amato, the e x-Senator from New York, mediates Holocaust lawsuits aga inst German and Austrian b anks for $350 an hour plus expenses.

Kagan rings up in 12 da ys, Eagleburger in 4 da ys, and D' Amato in 10 hours what my mother re c eived in suffering six years of Nazi persecution.\" 32 Finkelstein estimates that more than $20 b illion h as been collected in compensation claims arising from the Holocaust, includ ing the $1.25 billion h e says was extorted from Swiss banks before the e vidence to suppo rt the c laim of stealing funds from Jewish v ictims of the Nazis was produ ced. When an o fficial inquiry later reported, it did no t support the a llegations on which the money h ad b een d emanded - and p aid und er the threat of an econo mic boy cott - in a campaign led by Edgar Bronfman, the President of the World Jewish Cong ress (WJC). Bronfman said the money h ad to b e paid b efore the inquiry reported b eca use the victims were old and n eeded the money b efore they d ied. Once the money was in the c offer however, handing it out to the victims was s udd enly not nearly so u rgent. Bronfman told the US House Banking Committee that the Swiss s hou ld \"not be a llowed to make a profit from the a shes of the Holocaust\". But he later ackno wledged that the \"WJC treasury h as amassed no less than 'roug hly $7 billion' in compensation monies\".33 Readers of my o ther book s will have c ome a cross the multi-billionaire Bronfman family in Canada who bu ilt t heir media a nd liquo r empire on the back o f illegal booze running and o rganized crime. The Bronfmans are c onn ected to_ the unb elievably corrupt Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a major Illuminati operation. A taxpayer sued the Canadian gov ernment's tax-collecting scam, Revenue Canada, for allowing the Bronfmans to transfer hug e sums of money to a c ross-border trust fund without paying an estimated $300 to $600 milli on in taxes. I'm sure the Bronfman 'influence' on the Canadian gov ernment machine had no thing to do with this. I thorough ly recomm end Finkelstein's boo k, The Holocaust Indu stry, if you wish to see the levels to which self-styled, self-appointed 'Jewish leaders' can sink in \\ their unspeakable a buse a nd manipulation o f genuine survivors of Nazi Germany. The Israeli writer, Boas Evron, concluded: \"Holocaust awareness is an official, propagandistic indoctrination, a c hurning ou t of slogans and a false view of the world, the real aim of which is not at all an und erstanding o f the past, but a manipulation o f the present.\" 34 Finkelste ~ "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 61 emphasises the difference between what he calls the \"Nazi Holocaust\" and the e xtortion racket he terms, \"The Holocaust\", which fills the c offers of Jewish o rganisations and p t.0jects and no t the pockets of those who g enuinely suffered. Finkelstein acc uses Jewish o rganisations of behaving \"like a caricature from Der Sturmer\" - the infamous racist magazine of the Nazis. He refers to them as \"crook s\" and h as described Elie Wiesel, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, as the \"resident clown o f the Holocaust circus\". He goes on: \"Before June 1 967 [the Arab-Israeli war] the universalist message of concentration camp survivor Bruno Bettelheim resonated a mong American Jews. After the June war, Bettelheim was s hun ted a side in favour of Wiesel. Wiesel's prominence is a function of his ideological utility. Uniqueness of Jewish suffering/uniqueness of the Jews, ever-guilty Gentiles/ever- innocent Jews, unconditional defense of Israel/unconditional defense of Jewish interests: Elie Wiesel is The Holocaust.\" 35 When the Holocaust museum was planned for Washington DC, Wiesel led the campaign to commemorate onn 1y Jewish v ictims and no t the others targeted by the Nazis, includ ing thehandlcapped.36 Wiesel rebuk ed Israel's Shimon Peres for speaking o f two h olocausts of the 20th century, Auschwitz and Hiroshima. 37 Finkelstein highlights s ome of Wiesel's s trange remarks. Wiesel said in his memoirs that he read a book called The Critique of Pure Reason in Yidd ish, while saying that he was \"wholly ignorant of Yiddish gramm ar\".38 Even worse, the book was never translated into Yiddish. Wiesel also told a New York Times reporter that he was hit by a car in Times Square a t 45th Street and \"flew an entire block\" to land in 44 th. 39 He's definitely a man you can b elieve. It was Wiesel who wrote in the New Y ork Times Book Review that a tome ca lled The Painted Bird by \"Holocaust survivor\", Jerzy Kosinski, was \"one of the best incitements of the Nazi era\" and \"written with d eep sincerity and sensitivity\".40 Well not exactly b eca use Kosinski turned out to b e a fraud who made it all up. Another book on the same subject called Fragments won the Jewish National Book Aw ard b efore its \"Holocaust surviving \" author, Binjamin Wilkomirski, was expo sed as (a) not being Jewish and (b) spending the e ntire war in Switzerland. But, as Finkelstein writes, question ing is not allowed. It's racist: \"To question a survivor's testimony, to deno unce the role of Jewish collaborators, to sugge st that Germans suffered during the bombing of Dresden or that any s tate e xcept Germany c omm itted crimes in World War 11- this is all [claimed to be ] evidence ..• of Holocaust den ial. And to suggest that Wiesel has profited from the Holocaust Industry, or even to que stion h im, .amounts to Holocaust den ial.\" 41 Norman Finkelstein h as faced the wrath o f his targets and says the New York Times gave a more hostile review to h is book, The Holocaust Indu stry, than it did to Hitler's Mein Kampf \"I don 't want to p lay the martyr, but if you look at my history I didn't make out so well\", he said, \"I'm in exile in [DePaul University] Chicago b eca use I was thrown ou t of every [University] school in New Y ork.:' 42 Jewish p eople a s a whole are being conn ed as much; if hot more, than anyon e. Jack Bernstein, who is, like Arthur Koestler, an Ashkenazi, confirms the background I have high lighted: \"The p owerful Zionist propaganda machine ha s led the American p eople to be lieve that a Jew is a Jew - one race of people and that they are 'God's Chosen People' ... First, it is important for you to understand that Jews are not one race of peop le. There are two d istinct groups of Jews in the world and they c ome from two d ifferent areas of the world the Sephardic J ews from the Middle East and North Africa, and the Ashkena zi Jews c ome -from Eastern [and later Western] Europe. The Sephardic is the o ldest group and it is they, if any, who a re the Jews described in the Bible. They are b lood relatives to the Arabs - the on ly difference be tween them is religion. \"The Ashkena zi Jews, who now comprise 90% of the Jews in the world, had a rather strange beginning. According to historians, many of them Jewish, the Ashkena zi Jews c ame into e xistence a bout 1200 years ago · ... [ as the Khazars] .. . Some time du ring the 13th century, the Khazars were d riven from their and they migrated westward with most of them settling in Poland and Russia. The Khazars are now known Ashkena zi Jews. Because these' Khazar (Ashkenazi) Jews merely c hose Judaism, they are not really J ews - at least not blood Jews.\" 43 It is the Ashkenazi leadership ~ who are not Jewish by b lood and are not historically-conn ected to the lands of Israel- that took ov er Palestine on an h istorical fabrication and h ave c ontrolled the c oun try ever since!! Sam Hamod, a former advisor to the US S tate D e partment and former editor of Third World News in Washington, took up this theme in an Internet article.44 He wrote that \"actual genetic Jews\" were born in the Middle East and were kno wn as Sephardic Jews. These Jews did speak a Semitic langu age, Hebrew, from their earliest incarnation, but later also spok e Aramaic, Arabic a nd Amharic beca use of their location in Jerusalem and o ther Middle Eastern cities like what is now A ddis Ababa, Cairo, Baghd ad and Damascus. \"One rarely h ears a Sephardic Jew yelling, 'anti-Semite\"', he said, \"beca use they kno w better and b ecause he is aware of his own h istory within Semitic langu age speaking lands.\" Hamod continued:"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 62 \" ... most of those Ashkena zim Jews who were b orn and raised in America, such a s Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Feith, are not even Jews genetically, because they are de scended from Slavic tribes k nown a s the Khazars who con verted to Judaism and whose native language was Slavic and whose first lang uage in America ha s been English ... I am not saying a ll Ashkenazim are not Jews, but the way s ome of them I beha ve is c ertainly not in the way Moses brought Judaism from God through the Torah. One ha s but to look at the ha ters and war-mong e rs in the Bush circle o f influence and this is evident; no God would want them to be a ssociated with h is name. Thus, as a ' friend o f mine, Rabbi Shmuel Handelman put it, 'They may c all themselves Jews but I doubt very much if I'd call them that, and if r did, M:1'say they were the worst of what any person might be. I'd rather not be a ssociated with them.\" 4\" Rabbi Handelman is not alone. In an impassioned article headed \"Because We Are Jews\", Rabbi Mordechi Weberman p ledged his s uppo rt for the just treatment of the Palestinian p eople. I have included the full text in Append ix III beca use it is important to know that all people ca lling themselves J ewish do no t think the same. But this is what the Ashkenazi/Khazar leadership, like the Rothschilds, want the world to think. If they can sell the belief in 'one Jewish v oice' it means they can p romote their own 'voice' and their own agenda und er the banner of the 'Jewish p eople'. Rabbi Weberman said there were those who asked why they marched with the Palestinians. Why did they raise the Palestinian flag? Why d id they suppo rt the Palestinian, cause? \"You are Jews!\" they said. \"What are you do ing?\" His respon se was simple: \"It is precisely because we a re Jews that we march with the Palestinians and raise their flag! It is precisely 6ecause we are Jews that we demand that the Palestinian peop les be returned to their homes and Properties! Yes, in ou r Torah we are commanded to be fair. We a re called upon to pursue justice. And what could be more un just than the century-old a ttempt of the Zionist movement to invade a nother people's land , to d rive them out and steal their property? \"We h ave no doubt that would Jewish refugees have come to Palestine not with the intention of dominating, not with the intention of making a Jewish state, not with the intention of dispossessing, not with the intention of depriving the Palestinians of their basic rights, that they would have been welcomed b y the Palestinians, with the same hospitality ,that Islamic peoples have shown Jews throughou t history. And we would h ave 'lived together as Jews and Muslims lived be fore in Palestine in p eace a nd h armony.\" 46 In a message to \"our Islamic a nd Palestinian friends\", Rabbi Weberman said there a re Jews around the world that supported their cause. \"There shou ld b e a n apology to the Palestinian p eop le which is clear and precise\", he wrote. \"Zionism did you wrong . Zionism stole your homes. Zion ism stole you r land.\" He said they p roclaimed b efore the world that they' are the people of the Torah and that their faith d emanded that they b e hon est and fair, good and kind: \"We h ave a ttended hundreds of pro-Palestinian rallies over the years and everywhere we go the leaders and audience greet us with the warmth of Middle Eastern ho spitality. What a lie it is to say that Palestinians in pa rticular or Muslims in ge neral hate Jews. You ha te injustice. Not Jews. \" 47 Rabbi Ahron Cohen in his s tatement for the Neturei Karta group said the Zionists have made themselves appear to b e representatives and spok espeople of all Jews and thus their actions aroused animosity against the Jew's. \"But, this is s imply no t true! Zionism is not Judaism. Zionists canno t speak in the n ~ of Jews.\" According to the Torah and the Jewish faith, he said, the present Palestinian Arab claim to rule in Palestine was right and just - the Zionist claim was wrong and criminal: \"One must add to this wrong, the fact that in o rder to a chieve an ill conceived nationalistic ambition, a shocking contrave61tion of natural and humanitarian justice was c omm itted b y the Zionists in setting up an illegitimate regime in Palestine completely against the wishes of the e stablished population, the Palestinians, which inevitably had to be based on loss of life, killing and stealing.\" 49 He said this was a tragedy for the Palestinians and also for the Jewish p eople. When d id you last hear these authentic voices of the Jewish faith express these values in the mainstream m edia? Of course not, beca use this view is s upp ressed by the suppo rters of the Illuminati political movement called Zionism that must advance the lie that they speak for all Jewish p eople. When non -Jews challenge their actions they are dubb ed an \"anti-Semite\" and when Jewish p eople do the same they are dubb ed \"self-haters\" by these students of Machiavelli and Goebbels. For a Jewish p erson to speak ou t for universal Justice is to b e “a self hater''? What? These guy s are sick. Now that Isr a el exists, the Israelis and Palestinians will have to live together in mutual respect if the violence is to end. However, peace is not wanted by the z ealots behind the takeover of the Middle East and their murderous and manipulating intelligence arm, Mossad. Only the destruction 'Of the Arab world is"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 63 enough for them. To make these points is not \"anti-Semitism\" - the label used to stop legitimate debate and research. It is s imply p rovable fact as the documents highlighted in this book reveal. The irony o f this abusive term, \"anti-Semitic\", is that the overwhelming majority o f 'Jewish' people a re not Semitic beca use they come from southern Russia, not the Middle East. And, anyway, 'Semitic' refers to langu age- speaking, not genetics. The major Semite peoples of the Middle East are a ctually the Arabs! Greg Felton, a Canadian writer and specialist on Middle East affairs, said: \" ... What we know as the 'Jewish State' of Israel is really an e thnocentric garrison state e sta b lished b y a non-Semitic people for the de clared p urpose o f dispossessing a nd terrorizing a civilian Semitic peop le. \"In fact from Nov. 27, 1947, to May 15, 1948, more that 300 ,000 Arabs were forced from their homes and villages. By the end of the year, the nu mber was c lose to 800 ,000 b y Israeli estimates. Today, Palestinian refugees number in the millions.\" 50 Sup porting the nazis Another irony is that those ca lling themselves J ewish h ave suffered terribly ov er the years from the manipulations and agenda of those who rule them. Look at Nazi Germany where the mass of the Ashkenazi people were treated g rotesquely while their leaders collaborated with their fascist persecutors, who were fund ed by Ashkenazi bankers and the British and American elite, including the Bush family. President Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, was involved with the H9-rriman Empire in the funding o f the Nazis through a c ompany called the Union Banking Corporation (UBC ) and v irtually all the Nazi trade With the United States was und er the control of the Harriman interests and the stewardship o f Prescott Bush. The Union Bank interface d with the steel and b anking empire of Hitler fund er, Fritz Thyssen, whose factories built the Nazi war machinery. The UBC was closed do wn for trading with the e nemy and on e might ask why p rofessional 'Nazi hun ters' like Simon Wiesenthal have never pursued the Bush family?? The Bush- Nazi conn ection h as been h ighlighted by John Loftus, the president of the Florida Holocaust Museum, who pointed ou t that Prescott Bush derived a portion o f his personal fortune from his affiliation with the UBC . Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department's Na z i War Crimes Unit, said that leading Nazi industrialists s ecretly o wned the 'Harriman/Bush' bank and they were moving money into the UBC through a second b ank o f Holland even after the United States declared war on Germany. The bank was liqu idated in 1951, Loftus s aid, and President Bush's grandfather and g reat-grandfather received $1 .5 million as part of that dissolution. He said h e had a file of paperwork linking the bank and Prescott Bush to Nazi money. \"That's where the Bush family fortune ca me from: It came from the Third Reich\", Loftus s aid in a speec h during the Sarasota Reading Festival. The German pu blishing giant, Bertelsmann, is owned by the Thielens, who are reported to b e related to Fritz Thyssen. Bertelsmann pu blished Hitler's boo k, Mein Kampf, and was the biggest printer for the German army through its close ties to the Nazi Propaganda Ministry o f Joseph Goebbels., In, 2002, the c ompany was expo sed for its Nazi conn ections and for using Jewish slave labour. 52 (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret for the Illuminati background to the Nazi concentration camps and the Bush family and House of Windsor connections to the Third Reich). A Bertels m ann subsidiary in California has refused to p rint my book s on the c omm and o f the German headqu arters. Good . The majority o f JewishAmericans apparently v oted against Bush in 20 00 and the number would h ave been even h igher had they kno wn the family connections to the Nazis and who and what was behind his rise to the presidency. Canadian writer Greg Felton said this of the Zionist suppo rt for the Nazis: \"Israel would no t be po ssible today if the World Zionist Congress and o ther Zionist agencies hadn't formed comm on cause with Hitler's exterminators to rid Europe o f Jews. In e xchange for helping round up non- Zionist Jews, sabo tage Jewish resistance movements and betray the trust of Jews, Zionists s ecured for themselves s afe pa ssage to Palestine. This arrangement was formalized in a nu mber of emigration agreements s igned in 1 938. The most notorious c ase o f Zionist collusion concerned Dr Rudolf Kastner, Chairman of the Zionist Organization in [Khazar] Hungary from 194345 . To secure the safe passage o f 600 Zionists to Palestine, he he lped the Nazis s end 800,000 Hungarian Jews to their deaths. The Israeli Supreme Court virtually whitewashed Kastner's c rimes because to admit them would ha ve d enied Israel the moral right to e xist .” 53 Or as David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, said in a letter to the Zionist executive on December 17th 193 8: \"The saving of Jewish lives from Hitler is c onsidered here a s a po tential threat to Zionism, unless they are brought to Palestine. When Zionism had to choose be tween the Jewish p eople and the Jewish state, it unhesitatingly preferred the latter.\" 54 Alfred Rosenberg, the \"intellectual leader\" of the Nazi Party, is reported to h ave had 'Jewish'[that is Ashkenazi] ancestry.55 It was Rosenberg who g ave the Protocols of the Wise Men o f Zion to Hitler. These"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 64 were purported to reveal plans for world d omination alleged to h ave been p resented at the Jewish World Cong ress held in Basel in 1 897 and were used to 'justify' the horrific persecution o f Jews in Germany although not the Ashkenazi leaders involved with the Nazi Party). Rosenberg, who was born in Estonia, beca me editor of the Voelkischer Beebachter, the official Nazi Party n ewspaper, and h e wrote The Myth-of the Twentieth Century, which claimed that the Aryan race was the c reator of all values and culture while the Jews were agents of cultural corruption. Under Rosenberg's comm and Jewish libraries throughout Europe were ransacked and the spoils delivered to him in Frankfurt. He a lso h eaded a special unit, Einsatzstab Rosenberg, which plundered art and furniture belonging to Jews in o ccupied Western Europe.56 Ernst Hanfstaengl, a c lose friend o f US president Franklin Roosevelt, was also a c lose a ssociate of Hitler before the war. He says he was warned by the Austrian writer, Rudolf Komm er, that \"if any p olitical party emerges with an anti-Semitic programm e directed by Jewish o r half Jewish fanatics we shall have to watch ou t\". Hanfstaengl wrote that later, after experiencing ~ e influence that Alfred Rosenberg h ad ov er Hitler, he began to realise what that remark really meant: \"I thought back to Rudolf Komm er's remark about an an ti-Semitic programm e d irected b y J ewish o r half Jewish fana tics - Rosenberg was distinctly Jewish in ap pearance, although he would ha ve b een the first to protest furiously if anyone had questioned h is ancestry. Yet I used to see h im m ost mornings s itting in a dingy c afe a t the corner of Briennerstrasse and Augustenstrasse with a Hungarian Jew named Holoschi, who was one of his principle a ssistants. The man called h imself Hollander in Germany and was ano ther of these Jewish anti-Semites ... I suspected the [alleged ] Aryan ba ckground of many of the o thers. Strasser and Streicher looked Jewish to me a s well as figures like Ley, Frank and even Goebbels, who would ha ve had d ifficulty in p roving their pedigree,\" 57 Rosenberg and Goebbels worked closely together at the Propaganda Ministry. Never mind Rosenberg's own ancestry, what was he doing with a \"principle a ssistant\" that was Jewish when Rosenberg was one of the major architects of the master race madness and the persecution o f Jews? This is only on e of endless 'anomalies'. The German Ashkenazi banker, Max Warburg, was a director of I.G. Farben the c hemical and pharmace utical giant, that ~ the c oncentration camp at Auschwitz and was at the heart of Hitler's war machine (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free). His brother, Paul Warburg, who was behind the c reation of the Illuminati's Federal Reserve banking system that controls the American econo my, was a director of the US arm of 1.G. Farben. Moshe G01tlieb reveals in his boo k, American Anti-Nazi Resistance '33 -'41, that Max Warburg's s on, Erich, cabled his cousin, Frederick Wartmrg, a director of the Union Pacific Railroad, telling him to u se a ll his influence to stop all anti-Nazi propaganda a nd activity in America, includ ing atrocity n ews and un friendly p ropaganda in foreign p ress, mass meetings, etc\". Frederick cabled back to Erich: \"No respon sible group s here [are] urging [a] boy cott [of] German go ods, merely excited ind ividuals.\" Two d ays later, on March 31 st, 1933, the Warburg-controlled American Jewish Committee and the B'nai B'rith, heavily influenced by the Sultzbergers of the New Y ork Times, issued an o fficial joint statement saying \"no American boy cott against Germany b e e ncouraged,\" and advised \"no further mass meetings be held o r similar forms of agitation b e e mployed\".} Journalist John L. Spivak expo sed the Warburg conn ections to the Nazis in an article ('ID 1934 headed \"Wall Street's Fascist Conspiracy\",58 He revealed that the Warburg con trolled the American Jewish Committee that , oppo sed the a nti-Nazi boy cott, while their Kuhn Loeb and Co. had und erwritten Nazi shipping, He further expo sed the Warburg financing of pro-fascist political activities with their partners and allies, many o f whom were major figures in the American Jewish Committee a nd B'nai B'rith (which formed the Illuminati Anti Defamation League in 1913 ). Support for the Nazis by the Ashkenazi leadership was fund amental to Hitler! s war machine a nd this then led directly to the unimaginable suffering o f the Ashkenazi masses in Germany. It was this very suffering that the Ashkenazi 'leaders', most notably the Rothschilds, used to campaign for a homeland in Israel ~ a land to which they h ad no blood o r historical connection whatsoever. After the war, leading Zion ist fronts continued to support right-wing g roup s or ignore their actions when it suited them, Norman Finkelstein writes that, “Jewish elites even enlisted in, and financially sustained, right-wing extremist organisations like the All American Conference to Combat Comm unism and turned a blind eye a s veterans of the Nazi 55 entered the c oun try.lI59 Why would the Rothschilds and o ther leading 'Jewish' families do all this to their own p eople? It is a horrendou s thou ght and do esn't make sense, surely? To und erstand why this can h appen - and why the Bush family can so abuse 'fellow' Americans - we need to appreciate that the Illuminati elite have a different blood line to the general pop ulation. They are a group un to themselves who are 'hiding' within o ther races and n ations. The Rothschild family and company may h ave c ome out of the Khazar Empire, but we should no t confuse that with the mass - of the former Khazar, now A shkenazim, peoples. The Rothschild allegiance is not to them, but to the a genda of their real family, the nature of which I will reveal later. In o ther words, a Rothschild plot isn't a 'Jewish' plot. Erased from history"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 65 There is another important question that arises from all this. Even withou4Qe 'Jewish' - Ashkenazi conn ection, the Khazar Empire was enormously significant to world history. As Arthur Koestler says, ''The Khazars had their fingers in many historic pies\". The way the Khazars secured Eastern Europe from the invading Muslims alone is of massive significance. But were you ever told the history o f the Khazars at schoo l or anywhere e lse? Isn't it one hell of a c oincidence that on on e hand the Khazar story challenges the entire found ation o f Zionism and on the other the Khazars and their background h ave been p retty much erased from history? Benjamin H. Freedman, the former 'Jewish' businessman who campaigned ceaselessly against Zionism, said that in 1 948, the year that Israel was found ed, he a ddressed the large assembly o f the highest ranking o fficers of the United States Army\" at the Pentagon and told them abou t the Khazars and their relationship to the people of Israel. Afterwards, he said, he was approached by a lieutenant Colonel, the head o f the history d epartment of II one of the largest and h ighest scholastic rated institutions of higher education in the United States\". The man h ad taugh t history there for 16 y ears, Freedman said, but he had never in all his career as a history teac her or otherwise heard the word ‘Khazar' before that day. Freedman told this s tory in correspond ence with a Dr. David Goldstein in 19 54. He went on: \"Research ... revealed that [t he Khazar 'Jews'] were n ever 'Semites', are no t 'Semites' now, nor can they ever be regarded a s 'Semites' at any future time b y any s tretch of the imagination. Exhau stive research a lso irrevocably rejects as a fantastic fabrication the generally accepted belief by Christians that the so-called o r self-styled 'Jews' in Eastern Europe a re the legendary 'Chosen Peop le' so very vocally pub licized b y the Christian clergy from their pulpits. Maybe you can e xplain to me, my dear Dr Goldstein, the reason why and just how the origin and the h istory of the Khazars and Khazar Kingdom was s o well concealed from the world for so many c enturies? What secret mysterious power has been able for countless generations to keep the origin and the h istory of the Khazars and , Khazar Kingdom out of history text-boo ks and ou t of class-room courses in ' history throughout the world? “The o rigin a nd h istory of the Khazars and Khazar Kingdom are certainly incontestable h istorical facts; these ... facts also e stablish be yond any question of doubt the o rigin and h istory of the so-called or self- styled 'Jews' in Eastern Europe. The o rigin and h istory of the Khazars and Khazar kingdom and their relationship to the origin a nd e arly history of the so-called o r self styled 'Jews' in Eastern Europe was one of history's best kept secrets until wide publicity was given in recent years to my research on this s ubject. Do you no t think, my dea r Dr Goldstein, that it is time this whole subject was, dragged out of its hiding p lace?” 61 That was written in 19 54. We are still waiting. There Is no J ewish 'race' The e vidence insists that we must go even further than sugg esting the Ashkenazim are not genetically 'Jewish'. There is, in fact, no such thing as a Jewish 'race', just as there is no Aryan 'race' in the way it is portrayed, by the white supremacists. These are fabrications of history. What shou ld 'race' matter anyway? It's all illusion and childish b eyond b elief. Later in the boo k, when we e xplore the illusory n ature of reality, we ca n appreciate e ven more profoun dly the , nonsense of 'race' and ho w stupid it is to judg e people on the genetics of their body. In truth, no race e xists, except in the minds of the people, as we shall see. It is all illusion. Unfortunately 'race' and its related h istorical rights and claims are used as a political too l and source of mind manipu lation. This is why I am spending time e xpo sing some of the background . There a re people who follow the Jewish faith al ~ over the world. There a re white 'Jews', brown 'Jews', black 'Jews', Spanish 'Jews', Chinese 'Jews' etc., etc, that follow that belief system and good luck to 'them so long as they don 't force it on anyon e e lse. If they want to call themselves 'Jewish' on the basis of their faith then please feel free; it's non e of my bu siness. But there is not a Jewish 'race', let alone a 'chosen people'. Arthur Koestler points out that people ca lling themselves 'Jewish' across the globe have fat mote in comm on genetically with the \"host\" population than they do with eac h o ther. This was highlighted by Professor Juan Comas in his work, The Race Question in Modern Science, published, by UN ESCO, and by Raphael Patai in the Encyclopaedia 'Britannica: \"The findings of physical anthropology s how that, cont r a r y to popu lar view, there is no Jewish race. Anthropometric measurements of Jewish g roups in many parts of the world indicate that they differ greatly from one a nother with respect to a ll the important physical characteristics - stature, weight, skin colour, cepha lic index; facial index, blood g roups, etc.\" 62 \" Harry Shapiro p rodu ced the same a ssessment in h is UN ESCO w ork, The Jewish, People: A Biological History: "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 66 \"The wide range of variation be tween Jewish populations in their physical characteristics and the diversity of the gene frequencies of their blood g roups render any unified cl a ssification for them a contradiction in terms. For although modern racial theory admits s ome d egree of polymorphism or variation within a racial group, it doe s not permit distinctly different groups, measured b y its own criteria of race, to be iden tified a s one . To do so would make the b iological purposes of racial classification futile and the whole procedure arbitrary and meaningless. Unfortunately, this s ubject is rarely wholly divorced from non- biological considerations, and despite the evidence efforts c on tinue to be made to somehow segregate Jews as a d istinct racial entity. 63 The reason for the latter is obv ious by no w. It is to sell a false history and biology bo th to the mass of those who consider themselves 'Jewish' and to the rest of humanity. How can you claim to b e a special race , a 'chosen p eople' considered by 'God' to b e a bov e a ll others; and with special rights given by 'God' to o wn a certain p iece of land, when there is no such thing as a 'Jewish race'? Even the 'Jewish no se' is only a facial feature of a fraction o f 'Jewish' people a nd, here's the point, the same \"Jewish no se\" is found in far greater numbers today among the Caucasian tribes and the Turks of Asia Minor. Among the truly Semite peoples it is not seen at all. For goo dness sake, when you go b ack to the Biblical stories you find that Abraham, the alleged 'father' of the Jews, is claimed to h ave had a c hild with Hagar, an Egyp tian, and the same theme applies to o ther heroes like Joseph, Moses, David and Solomon. Their Biblical wives, sexual partners 'or parents came from peoples like the Moabites, Amm on ites, Edomites, Zidonians, Hittites, Geshurites and so on. During the Babylon ian exile the 'Israelites', including members of the priestly families, married Gentiles. As Koestler says, even before the Diaspora (the 'Scattering') the Israelites were a thoroug hly hyb ridized race'. (I will explore the origins of the 'Israelites' and their/star' names later). This 'hyb ridization' applied to most historic nations, writes Koestler, \"and the point would n ot need stressing if it were not for the persistent myth o f the-i3iblical Tribe having p reserved its racial purity throughou t the a ges.\" 64 He concludes his excellent book: \"To sum up, the Jews of our day have no cultural-tradition in comm on, merely c ertain h abits and behaviour- patterns, derived b y s ocial inheritance from the traumatic experience of the ghetto, and from a religion which th ~ majority doe s not practice o r believe in, but nevertheless c onfers on t h em a p seudo - national status ... the linge ring influence o f Judaism's racial and h istorical message, though based on illusion, acts as a powerful emotional break by appealing to tribal loyalty.\" 65 This emotion and fear, engendered no t least by the e vents of Nazi Germany, are mercilessly exploited by their self-appointed 'leaders' who kno w the real background . The Ashkenazi 'leaders' have no more c oncern for the plight of Jewish p eople than the Bushes have for Americans. They are following an agenda a nd all people, no matter what their race or label, are fodd er to b e used and abused in its name. If those leaders were not so ob sessed with race, and special rights through race , this s ection o f the book would not have been n ecessary, but the record n eeds to b e straightened for racist and 'anti-racist' alike. To think that what happened in Germany is being u sed to advance a fascist agenda turns my stomach. But it is. I have detailed some of the' background to Israel and its prominent suppo rters beca use the supp ression o f these facts is being u sed in the manipu lation o f the 'war on terrorism' and the c onqu est of the Arab world. Familiar faces It was Ashkenazi ancestors of. the Khazar people who were behind-the Clean Break do cument produ ced for Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996 that called for Israel to \"shape its s trategic e nvironment\", starting with the removal of Saddam Hussein and the installation o f Hashemite monarchy in Baghd ad. With Iraq b rought und er Jordanian Hashemite influence, Jordan and Turkey would form an axis along with Israel to we a ken and \"roll back\" Syria, it said. Jordan could also u ndermine Lebanon by \"weaning\" the Shia Muslim pop ulation away from Syria a nd Iran and re-establishing their former ties with the Shia in the new Hashemite kingdom of Ir aq, the document said. \"Israel will not only contain its foes; it will transcend them.\" 66 To achieve this, the document stated Israel would h ave to win b road American suppo rt for these new policies and it advised Netanyahu to p resent them \"in language familiar to the Americans by tapping into themes of American administrations during the Cold War which apply well to Israel\" .67 The Guardian article revealing the c ontents of the document pointed ou t that there is little to distinguish the 1996 Clean Break p aper fr om the outpou rings of other \"right-wing and ultra-Zionist think-tanks\". Nor do the similarities-end there; The leader of the 'prominent opinion makers' who wrote the paper for Netanyahu was Richard Perle, now-chairman o f the Defense Policy Board at the Pentagon and a major player in the orchestration o f th war against Iraq (and whoever next). Another author was ... Doug las Feith, the neo-conservative lawyer, now und er-secretary o f policy at the Pentagon , who is also at the forefront of the US agenda for the c onqu est of the Middle East. Two o thers were David Wurmser and h is wife, Meyrav, who was co-found er of Memri, a Washington-based charity that “distributes articles translated from Arabic newspapers portraying Arabs in a bad light\".68 David Wurmser worked with Perle. at the American"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 67 Enterprise Institute a nd is now at the State Department as a special assistant to John Bolton, the Under- Secretary for arms control and international security. Bolton is yet another fr ont-line manipulator of the invasion o f Ir aq, as I mentioned earlier. Meyrav Wurmser told the BBC that the Clean Break do cument was: \"No more than a mental exercise d one in a think tank by a g roup of people. Yes man o f us [beh ind the Bush policies] are Jewish, there's no need to apo logise to anyone for that. Most of us, all of us in fact, are pro- Israel, some o f us more seriously s o than o thers, but we h ave no p roblem at all with criticising Israel.\" 69 James Colbert of the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) was also an author of the Israeli Clean Break report in 19 96. It says that one of its aims is \"to inform the American defense and foreign affairs comm unity about the important role Israel can and do es play in b olstering democratic interests in the Mediterranean and the Middle East\". In p ractice, as the Guardian article pointed out, this largely involves\" ... sending retired American military b rass on jaunts to Israel after which many o f them write suitably h awkish n ewspaper articles ' or letters to the editor\" .70 There a re a lso bu siness relationships between retired US military o fficers' on the Jinsa board and American companies s upp lying weapon s to Israel, but don 't ever mention Israel's massive stockpile of nuclear, chemical and biological weapon s. Shhhhh ! They don 't exist, OK ? Sam Hamod, a former advisor to the US S tate Department, said: \"Israel at this time ha s a h uge stock of atomic weapon s, than ks to o ur assistance. Israel also ha s major supp lies of anthrax and o ther poison weapons, aga in, thanks to th ~ assistance o f the US Government who at one time feared Arab a ttacks on Israel These are the reasons that Israel will not allow atomic inspectors into Israel and will not sign the vaun ted, American-pushed, Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that America wants everyone e lse to sign, and u ses pressure to a chieve this, but never on Israel. \"As to the po ison weapons, neither America nor Israel will sign this accord banning po ison weapons because they have so many in their security vaults. Thus, to many experts in the world, the US attack on Iraq for WMD and poison weapons, was very much a ba ld-faced farce, without merit, when two of the biggest abu sers of atomic proliferation and po ison weapons were the ones c alling for the war, America a nd Israel (and of course, followed b y the pood le h imself, Tony Blair, who has his own weapons s ecrets that have no t yet seen the light of day).\" 71 When Saddam Hussein o ffered in 1990 to d e stroy such weapon s, if Israel: did the same with theirs, the United States gov ernment said it was not willing to n egotiate on that subject - not least beca use to pub licly accept that Israel has a massive nuclear capability would make illegal the billions of dollars of US aid to that coun try every y ear. They all know of Israel’s nuclear stockpile, but if no on e officially admits it exists they can go on with bu siness as usual. This was further expo sed in a BBC television do cumentary in the Correspond ent series in 20 03 that revealed ho w this you -don't-say-anything-and-I-won't agreement is kno wn as \"nuclear expediency\". The programm e highlighted the inhuman treatment of Mordechai Vanunu who h ad already b een jailed for 17 y ears, 11 o f them in isolation, for warning the world about the produ ction o f atomic weapon s in Israel. Vanunu worked for ten y ears in the Dimona 'Atomic Research Reactor' in the Israeli southern d esert region and told a reporter from the London Sunday Times abou t the secret produ ction o f nuclear weapon s in underground levels under that reactor. The report was pub lished in October 1986 and Vanunu was kidnapped in Rome by the Israeli intelligence a gency Mossad and shipped to Israel, where he was secretly, tried and convicted. In retaliation for the programm e, the Israeli gov ernment press office, a department of the Prime Minister's Office, banned BBC correspond ents in Israel from contact with gov ernment ministers and o fficials and from official press conferences.73 Daniel Seaman, the head o f the press office, said the broadcast had served those who \"demon ise Israel and anti- Semitic e lements\". Here w ~ go, yawn, yawn. The truth is that the behaviour of the Israeli gov ernment demonises Israel without any h elp from anyon e e lse. Seaman also added that the broadcast was something a 'democratic' [sic] State like Israel canno t tolerate. 74 The Jinsa pincer The Israeli Clean Break do cument called for the very agenda that has been un folding since the Bush administration came illegally to power.'

The US gov ernment acc used the Syrian: regime of President Bashar al-Assad o f state terrorism, develop ing weapon s of mass destruction and h arbou ring fugitive Iraqi officials.

But speak o r write a n o f these highly relevant facts and you are labelled (inacc urately from every angle) an anti-Semite. What, for telling the truth? Yes, especially for telling the truth, that's the point of the smear. Tam Dalyell is a veteran Labou r MP who h as campaigned against coun tless wars and, like his colleague George Galloway, was a vocal oppon ent of the invasion o f Ir aq. Dalyell said that Bush and Blair were being un du ly influenced by Jewish ministers and officials who h ad an agenda for Israel that did no t allow fair and equal treatment of the Arab world. He referred to a c abal in the United States based on the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) and later said h e was referring to p eople like Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, John Bolton, Douglas Feith and Ari Fleischer, Bush's press spok esman. \"Those people drive this policy\", he said.79 He a lso h ighlighted the role of Blair's unelected Middle, East envoy , Lord Levy, who is not a member of the gov ernment and canno t be questioned by p arliament. Were these fair points made with freedom of speec h? Oh no , not in the brave new world. Professor Eric Moon man, president of the Zionist Federation, who was a Labou r MP from 1966 to 1979, said h e was seeking advice on whether there was a case for referring Dalyell's remarks to the Commission for Racial Equality und er the law of inciting racial hatred. \"I believe there is\", hesaid.80 Well, let me tell you what I believe, Professor Moon man. I believe that if Dalyell had said that Bush and Blair were being un du ly influenced by Arab, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Dutch, German o r French etc., etc., ministers and o fficials, Professor Moon man's s ilence would h ave been d eafening. So where's the real racism? Indeed what can b e more racist than to claim you are the \"Chosen People\" and abov e a ll others? , Anti-Semitism' is a smokescreen u sed to stop legitimate debate a nd Dalyell's treatment is just another example. It is very enlightening to look into the ce sspits in which wallow the major organisations behind the 'anti-Semitic' smear campaigns. The Anti-Defamation League, which h as tried h ard to stop me having a public platform in countries like Canada, operates by d efaming p eople in line with its Orwellian remit. The AD L manipulates unthinking, unquestioning mind fodder to man the 'anti-Semite' protests, most of them gleaned from the lud icrous 'Left' (as oppo sed to the ridiculous 'Right'). Too many on the Left wear their hearts on their sleeves and their brains in a dark p lace where the Sun don 't shine. They are c hild's play for the manipulators. Ironically, the Anti-Defamation League (AD L), the major orchestrator of 'anti-Semite' protests, is abou t as far fr om 'the Left as you could imagine. It conn ects into Mossad and the global 'intelligence' network and to o rganised crime '(mostly the same thing, anyway). The ADL gave Mo Dalitz,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 69 the Las Vegas gangster, their 'Torch o f Freedom' award in 1985 for donating milli ons of dollars to Israel. Dalitz Was an associate of the infamous mega-criminal, Meyer Lansky. In 199 3, AD L offices were raided by San Francisco po lice a nd the-evidence came to light that the 'anti- racist' organisation h ad illegally obtained information from Tom Gerard, a c orrupt police officer, and Roy Bullock, a political informant and infiltrator on the AD L payroll since 1960 . Bullock was employed as a 'fact-finder' or what we would call a spy. He would infiltrate not only op enly 'anti-Semitic' group s, but also labour unions, pro-Palestinian, American Arab and anti-apartheid o rganizations, usually u nder false pretences. Bullock, who was not Jewish, would then p ass that information to the AD L. What a though t: an 'anti-racist' organisation k eeping files on anti-apartheid campaigners. The ADL even kept\" file upon file\" on liberal San Francisco Jews who d isagreed with Israeli policies. The files included Social Security nu mbers, driver's licence numbers, addresses, phon e numbers and g roup memberships. Some of the information was sold to foreign gov ernments, including Israeli and South A frican intelligence group s. Pete McCloskey, a former Repub lican cong ressman from San Mateo Coun ty, was an attorney in the law suits against the AD L. He Wants the gov ernment to revok e its tax-exempt status (no chance). Since they o bv iously are working in conjunction with the Israeli government, he said, they should register as s uch. \"Referring to themselves as an education g roup is s imply a sham\", the a ttorney said. 81 Dr Alfred M. Lilienthal the a uthor of There Goes the Middle East, The Other Side of the Coin; and The Zionist Connection, said the AD L was \"ever ready to apply the smear and v ilification to censure a nd silence, thus building an iron curtain over America that would b ar any criticism, however constructive, of Israel, Zionists, or Jews (Judaism is rarely, if ever, involved), ... \" 82 He said that without exaggeration the AD L was the single most influential organization in the United States: \"It works c losely with the Israeli intelligence a gency, Mossad, and sometimes with the FBI or CIA. Through its multi-fold a ctivities and ability to crush d issent, it is probably more responsible for American a ttitude s and American foreign po licy toward the Middle East than an y other single force ... Through its multiple p rivate and public reports and publications, allegedly directed aga inst prejudice and b igotry, the ADL can e xert enormous influence and intimidation, often b ordering on b lackmail, in o rganizations and individuals, particularly people in public life. It provides an indispensable ba ckup for ... effective lobbying of the Congress and White House on b ehalf of an ever- increasing e conomic and military aid to Israel ... Many ADL charges aga inst critics of Israel and Zionism are totally inaccurate, questionable, or based u pon half-truths. Its s ecret and confidential reports, widely distributed in liberal circles, often a ttribute the stock quo tation, 'but some o f my best friends are Jews,' to its s ubjects, implying an ti-Semitism. Odious .impressions are created by twisting o r distorting a few w ords, or the context in which they were u ttered.\" 83 I sure kno w that to b e true. After Israel's attacks on Lebanon in 19 96, with the massacre of more than a hund red civilians at Qana, Ari Shavit, a c olumnist with the newspaper, Haaretz, said that Israel could act with impunity b eca use \"we have the Anti-Defamation League ... \"84 Its key role is to target those who are challenging the Illuminati agenda by b randing them racists and the ADL definition o f 'anti-Semitic' gets wider by the day. The ADL's Nathan Perlmutter claimed that the \"real anti-Semitism\" in America c onsisted of policy initiatives \"corrosive of Jewish interests\", such as affirmative ac tion, cuts in the defense budg ets, and n eo-isolationf1t1I\\ ~ as well as oppo sition to nu clear power and even electoral reform.55 Any question ing o f the AD L is racist, or, as s ociologist John Murray Cuddihy, put it: \"Not only do es anything Jews do o r refrain from doing h ave nothing to do with anti-Semitism, but any attempt to explain anti- Semitism by referring to the Jewish contribution to anti-Semitism is itself an instance of anti-Semitism!\" 86 The AD L is headed by an Ashkenazi called Abraham' Abe' Foxman, who claims to b e a \"Holocaust survivor\", but never saw the inside of a c oncentration camp o r suffered p ersecution by the Nazis beca use they b elieved h e was a Christian. Foxman accepted $100 ,000 for the AD L from the mega-crook b illi onaire, Mark Rich, and then advised h im to seek a pardon for his crimes. Months later Rich's lawyers filed for a pardon and Foxman wrote to President Bill Clinton on AD L notepaper in suppo rt of the a pplication. The pardon was granted by Clinton in his last hou rs in o ffice a mid enormous ontroversy.87 Foxman h ad sugg ested the pardon to h is friend, Avner Azulay, an agent for Israel’s Ashk enazi spy agency, Mossad, who was head o f the Rich Found ation that has don ated a total of at least $250 ,000 to the AD L.88 Rich's lawyer was Lewis Libby, Cheney's C h ief of Staff, and a member of the Project for the New A merican Century. The web is enormous. The brilliant Israeli writer, Israel Shamir, highlights the Zion ist (Ashkenazi/Khazar) Anti- Defamation League (AD L) in an article on his website. 89 Shamir says of Foxman and o ther 'anti-Semite' propagandists: \"The chief proponent of this well-endowed movement is an American [Ashkena zi] Jew, the h ead of ADL, Abe Foxman.

It’s not strange , as the very emphasis on 'anti-Semitism' is disgustingly racist, as if it were worse than racism aga inst anyone e lse.

He said that when the ADL called someone c ritical of Israel, Zion ists or Zion ism, an \"anti-Semite\", this was pure non sense. He said h e was not \"touting for people who are a nti-Jewish o r anti-Arab o r anti-any e thn ic or racial group\". Those who stereotyped o r attacked o thers based on their race or ethnicity were dead wrong and should b e c ond emned, he said: \"But so too shou ld those who abuse labels and u se them wrongly to stop o thers from being justifiably critical shou ld a lso be condemned (and in this c ase, I am referring to the ADL and o ther groups of that sort who labe l people with impunity and carelessness, sometimes wrecking their careers, their reputations, their businesses and their lives! \"Unfortunately, the misuse of the label, 'anti-Semitic' and its c onsequences have be en so b ad that even presidents, sena tors, congress people, media g iants and a ll others in the world cringe a t being labe lled, 'anti-Semitic' by s ome Zionist, Israeli or ignorant religious, media o r social group.

Dr Nahun Goldman, former president of the World Jewish Congress, said: \"Current decline of overt anti-Semitism might constitute a n ew danger to Jewish survival ... The d isappearance of anti-Semitism in its c lassic mean ing, while beneficial to the political and material situation of Jewish communities has had a very negative e ffect on our internal life.\" 94 Leo Pfeffer of the American Jewish Congress also said it was possible that some anti-Semitism is necessary in o rder to insure Jewish survivap5 Or rather the survival of Zionism. Norman Finkelstein has s een it all before: \"By the 1970 s, anti-Semitism was no longer a salient feature of American life. Nonetheless, Jewish leaders started sounding a larm bells that American J ewry was threat e ned b y a virulent 'new anti-Semitism'. The main exhibits of a prominent ADL study ('for those. who h ave d ied be cause they are Jews') included the ,Broadway s how, Jesus Christ Superstar and a counterculture tabloid that 'portrayed Kissinger as a fawning syc ophan t, coward, bully, flatterer, tyrant, social climber, evil manipulator, insecure snob, unprincipled seeker after power' - in the event, an understatement. \"For organised American Jewry, this c ontrived h ysteria over a n ew anti-Semitism served multiple p urposes. It boo sted Israel's s tock as the refuge o f last resort if and when American Jews needed o ne. Moreover, t he fund-raising a ppeals of Jewish o rganisations purportedly c ombating anti-Semitism [like the ADL] fell on more receptive ears. 'The an ti-Semite is in the u nhappy position', Sartre on ce observed, 'of having a vital need for the very enemy he wishes to de stroy. For these Jewish o rganisations the reverse is equally true. With an ti-Semitism in short supp ly, a cutthroat rivalry between major Jewish 'defense' organ isations - in particular, the ADL and the Simon Wiesenthal Cent e r - has erupted in recent years.\" 96 Don't do a s I do - do a s I say These a re the organisations and methods used to ~ top·tt1.Vestigation into those a t the heart of power as I, and many o thers, have found .

BBC reporter Steve Bradshaw said in his Panorama documentary on the neo-cons': \"By no w w e had p icked up a recurrent theme of insider talk in Washington.

Professor Eliot Cohen, the c lose friend o f his former college dean, Paul Wolfowitz, is on the US Defense Policy Board and involved with both the American Enterprise Institute and the Project for the New American Century. He took the same old tired line when asked by Steve Bradshaw why h e was concerned abou t the sugg estion that American po licy was all a c onspiracy whipped up by a group o f neo-conservative hawks, who are somehow allied to Israel\". Cohen replied: \"Well sometimes the word n eo-Conservative is used when what they would really like to say is Jews.\"; 'They' being who?\" \"Peop le that use that kind of language and a s a Jew I find that offensive.

No, no, that's anti-Semitic\". But what is the difference? Rabbi Yaac ov Perrin was quo ted in the New Y ork Daily News as saying, One milli on Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.\" 99 That is actually anti-Semitism against the truly Semitic people, the Arabs. If anyon e said that abou t a person calling themselves J ewish they would b e dubb ed racist and, in some c oun tries like Canada, arrested und er 'Hate Crime' laws. Why is it racist to u se the words Jewish o r Israel, but not when you do the same with Arabs or Islam? Rabbi Ahron Cohen said in a statement for the orthodox Jewish, anti-Zionist, Neturei Karta group : \"It must be c lear that oppo sition to Zion ism and its crimes does not imply h atred o f Jews. On the c ontrary Zionism itself and its deeds are the biggest threat to Judaism.\" 100 But as I write, Rick Santorum, the Republican Senator of Pennsylvania, bas propo sed a law that, in effect, prohibits the c riticism of Israel on American college ca mpuses by threatening the universities with federal funding cuts if they allow students and staff to pub licly criticise Israel. 101 Santorum was the guy who suppo rted the 'Syrian Accoun tability Act', which acc uses Syria of backing 'terrorism' and d evel9ping weapon s of mass destruction. In true Orwellian fashion, his plan to b an freedom of expression was called \"ideolog ical diversity\" legislation while ac tually seeking to suppress s uch diversity. Criticism of Israel would b e a n act of \"anti-Semitism\" (impossible when Israel is controlled by people that are not Semitic!.

'Jewish' or Ashkenazi people ca n travel to Israel, declare c itizenship, and b e granted all the privileges that are denied to Palestinians who h ave lived in that land for hundreds of years. Even the 'Jewish' pop ulation is divided into levels of privilege decided by g enetic origin. The white Ashkenazim from Europe a nd America a re by law at the top o f the pyramid o f privilege. Below them in Israel's genetic caste system are the Sephardic Jews or Mizrahim (the \"Eastern Ones\"), who came from Arab coun tries and do h ave a n h istorical conn ection to the Middle East. Sephardic people a re descended from 'Jews' who were expelled from Spain in 1 492. They lived in p eac e with the Arabs for hund reds, sometimes thou sands, of years before the Ashkenazi arrived in nu mbers from Europe in the mid-20th century u nder the banner of the Rothschild-controlled p olitical movement called Zionism. Rabbi Ahron Cohen said in a statement for the anti-Zion ist Neturei Karta group that the c onn ection b etween Muslims and Jews goes right back into ancient history. \"Mostly the relationship was friendly and mutually b eneficial\", he said, \"Historically, the situation frequently was that when Jews were being p ersecuted in Europe they found refuge in the various Muslim coun tries. Our attitude to Muslims and Arabs can on ly b e one of fr iendliness and respect.\" 106 The Sephardic Jews were kept in corrugated iron transit camps where Ashkenazi officials tried to strip them of their\" Arabness\" by replacing their \"unpronoun cea ble\" Arab n ames with go od 'Jewish' names. Most had to work ten to twelve hou rs a day in d isease a nd squalor. Their high d eath rate was explained by one Zion ist official as a “comm on and n atural thing\".107 Yemeni\" Jews in p articular faced extraordinary discrimination as they were transported, often against their wishes, from Yemen to Israel and h eld in p rimitive ca mps.

It was all the more tragic for Palestinian Israelis, who couldn't even read a bout Arab h istory in textboo ks. \"108 At the bottom of the genetic pile in the a partheid o f 'free, democratic' Israel, come the black Jews from Ethiopia, who are treated appalling ly. But even they are place d by la ~ abov e the Palestinians. Israel is a fund amentally racist state in which the minority, the Ashkenazim, dominate a nd d ictate to the Sephardic/ Arab majority on the basis of genetic origin. A report by the US organisation, Human Rights Watch, said: \"There is no g eneral prohibition o f discrimination o r guarantee of equality in any o f Israel's Basic Laws. Indeed, equality was explicitly excluded from the Basic Law: Human Freedom and Dignity when it was drafted. 109 A personal story Jack Bernstein, an American Ashkenazi, moved to Israel from the United States, lured by the propaganda abou t the Jewish ho meland. What he e xperience sickened h im and h e detailed what he witnessed in an"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 73 article e ntitled lithe Life Of An American Jew In Racist-Marxist Israel\".110 He said that Zion ist propaganda has led the American p eople to b elieve that Zionism and Judaism are one a nd the same a nd that they are religious in n ature. This, he said, was a blatant lie. \"Judaism is a religion; but Zion ism is a political movement started mainly by East European (Ashkenazi) Jews who for centuries have b e en the main force behind communism and socialism\", he writes. The ultimate goal of the Zion ists, said Bernstein, is a one- world government under the c ontrol of the Zion ists and the Zionist-oriented International Bankers.11I He said that after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war Jews in. America were filled with p ride that\" our homeland \" had become so po werful and successful. They h ad also b een manipu lated by false propaganda that Jews in America were being p ersecuted, he said. \"50, between 1967 and 197 0, approximately 5 0,000 American Jews fell for this Zion ist propaganda a nd migrated to Israel. I was one of those suckers\". Bernstein h ad no emotional conflict with leaving the United States because those calling themselves J ews are allowed to h ave citizenship o f both Israel and America, although this does not apply to any o ther Americans. Soon after arriving in Israel, Bernstein fell in love with Ziva. She was a \"Sephardic Jewess from Iraq who, like myself had for the Zionist propaganda a nd h ad migrated to Israel\". Jack and Ziva were married and that's when h e realised h e was living in a racist state. He said that for the first three years of their marriage they h ad to live with Ziva's aunt ,beca use of the c ritical hou sing shortage in Israel and b eca use of racism\". He said this was the genetic system used to allot hou sing: 1) First choice goe s to Ashkena zim who ha ve lived in Israel for many y ears. 2) Second in line a re Ashkena zim from Europe, especially if they marry an Israel-born Ashkenazi. Third are Ashkenazim from the United States, even be tter if they marry an. Israel-born Ashkena zi. 3) Third a re Ashkenazi from the United States, even be tter if they marry an Israel-born Ashkenazi. 4) Only after all of the above are housed do Sephardic J ews, with an h istorical connection to this region, have a choice of whatever is left. 5) At the bo ttom of the list come the Muslims, Druze a nd Christians. Jack Bernstein writes that even though h e was an Ashkenazi from the United States, he was place d lower on the list for hou sing b eca use he had married a Sephardic Jewess. He said that employment opportunities were allocated in the same way: the Ashkenazim get the best job ~ ; Sephardic Jews are next; while Muslims, Druze a nd Christians filled the menial jobs with ~ great many left unemployed. The Shas Party in Israel was specifically formed to address the discrimination against Sephardic people by the Ashkenazi elite. Israel is found ed on outrageous racism of the most appalling and sinister nature. It is no less $an apartheid and y et Ashkenazi organisations like the Anti-Defamation League go around hu rling the label \"racist\" and\" anti- Semite\" at everyon e e lse. Bernstein dismissed the very idea that Israel is either fr ee or democratic. It is, he said, a racist state: \"The Ashkena zi Jews, who migrated to Israel from Germany, while sympathetic to comm unism and support it, t end to favour the p ractices of. Nazi-style fascism. During World Warp in Germany these e lite Zionist Ashkena zi Jews worked closely with Hitler's Gestapo in p ersecuting the lower class German Jews and delivering them to concentration camps. Now living in Israel, these e lite Zionist Jews, who were well trained in Nazi style fascism and favor it, have imposed many facets of fascism on Israel. \"To g ive the impression that Israel is a de mocracy, members of the Knesset (Israel's Congress) are e lected - butj1::S an o dd kind of election. This is where Israel's s o-called democracy s tops. It doe sn't make any difference which pa rty wins an e lection, the L ikud or the L abor party, the e lite Zionist Jews rule in a dictatorial manner - giving favors to the e lite clique a nd b rutally s upp ressing an y dissent. \"Concerning Nazism/fascism ease let me clear a po int. Germans are an a dmirable people - I dare say even great. But in Germany, the ge neral population were victims of the Nazis who through cunning a nd b rutality gained power. In Germany, the average Jews were victims of the Zionist elite who worked ha nd in h and with the Nazis. Many of those same Zionist Jews, who, in Germany, had worked with the Nazis, came to Israel and joined h ands with the Zionist/comm unist Jews from Poland a nd Russia. It is the two faces of comm unism and Nazi-style fascism that rule Israel. Democracy is merely an illusion. \"Regarding the tie be tween the e lite Ashkenazi Jews and .the Nazis, take a look at the word 'Ashkenazi' - ,look aga in - 'Ashkenazi,' Interesting isn't it?\" Norman Fink lestein, in his book, Image And Reality Of The Israel-Palestine Conflict, compares Israel's treatment of the Palestinians to the a partheid o f South Africa a nd the view of the American settlers to n ative Americans. Asked if Israel was a democracy, he said: "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 74 \"Was South Africa a d emocracy in the o ld da ys? it was a d emocracy. or whites, for the 'superior people'. Similarly, Israel, for the larger part, of its history, has been a society where ha lf the p opulation has all the rights and ha lf the popu lation has none.\" 113 There ca n b e no more blatant example of this in Israel than the 'wall', actually p art-wall, part-fence, cutting off I srael from the Palestinian areas along a 150 mile 'border' decided by the Israeli gov ernment. This has parted Palestinian families, includ ing fathers and mothers, from their wives, husbands and children, and destroyed the livelihoods of Palestinian farmers by pu tting their land on the Israeli side of the wall Qalqilya, once kno wn as the West Bank's \"fruit basket\", is cut off . on three sides from the farms which supply its markets and the second -largest water sources in the region. Access to the 40,OOO inhabitant town consists of a single Israeli checkpoint. But don 't say anything, it's anti-Semitic. The many defamed b y the few The terrible potential irony is that the manipulations of the neo-cons in America on Israel's behalf, and the actions of Israel, are going to b e seen as a 'Jewish p lot' when the overwhelming majority o f such p eople on this planet are victims of the plot, not perpetrators of it. Indeed the Ashkenazi neo-cons and those in control of Israel are . not even Jewish. But all 'Jewish' people get tarred by the uninform e d and the truly racist with the same label as the manipulating few. Washington, journalist Jim Lobe, a long -standing o ppon ent of anti- Semitism and an investigator of the neo-cons s ince the 1970 s, made this s ame point: \"It's no secret; t he majority of neo-conservatives ha ve b een and remain Jewish. That is a fact. They do no t represent the view of a majority of the American Jewish comm unity.\" He was asked if it was legitimate to talk abou t the pro-Israeli po litics of so many n eo-conservatives. \"Well, I think it's very difficult to un derstand them if you d on't begin a t that point. I would think people would want to talk about that rather open ly because to the e xtent that you suppress it; I think then it festers.\" 114 Well said Jim. But how can the Ashkenazim from what is now southern Russia, who conv erted to Judaism and h ave no g enetic or historical conn ection to the land o f Israel, really b e regarded as 'Jewish' in the sense that they claim? How can they be? Is a German o r Russian who conv erts to the Church o f England regarded as English? Of course not. The fact is that the American and Israeli governments are c urrently so close you can't see the join, but you are a racist if you say that this relationship is clearly no t going to' produce a policy that gives justice to the Palestinians or other Arab n ations. John Hamre, who runs the Center for Strategic a nd International Studies, was only stating the obv ious when h e pointed out that, . \"We're so close to Israel so on e-sided, that people in the Middle East don 't take us seriously\" .115 A former US ambassador and White House a ide quo ted in the UK D aily Telegraph said: \"One congressman, Jim M oran, said that if it weren't for Israel, we wouldn't have been go ing to war, and he was accused of anti-Semitism. Because of the a tmosphere of war, deference to the President and the huge power of the Israeli lobby, we d idn't even h ave a debate a bout whether we shou ld go to war. We simply jumped into it.\" 116 Arthur Schlesinger, the former special assistant to President Kennedy, said the United States was totally dominant \"except in the c ase of Israel- Israel dominates US\".117 People should b e free to makes all the points beca use it is highly relevant to what is happening in the Middle East and affects us all. This is not a Jewish p lot for global control as s ome sugg est. It is a c onspiracy by a fascist mind-set that can infest the consciousness of anyon e no matter what their racial or ethnic background. There a re white American, British and Europe fascists; Arab fascists; black African fascists; Chinese fascists; Argentine fascists; and there are Ashkenazi fascists. If we ire going to expo se the web that is daily entrapping more of our basic freedoms, we must refuse to h ave that fact edited by those who u se the smokescreen o f 'racism' to stop the expo sure of those involved in the global dictatorship. The Fourth Reich, or the overt re-emergence of the Third, is now imposing itself on our lives. It is time to face up and g row up arid stop seeing the world in the juvenile polarities of black and white, us and them, good g uys and b ad guy s, good race a nd b ad race, at programm es the reality o f the political Left, , Right and Centre. There a re shades of grey and that's where we need to look if we want to find ou t what is really h appening .

Galileo Galilei There is s o much to kno w' before the invasion o f Ir aq in 2 003 can b e fully u nderstood and it goes back a long way. The idea that the conqu est of Iraq was decided in a matter of weeks because of the imminent- danger to tl1e world o f Saddam Hussein should insult the intelligence of a pea: It was .part of a long planned strategy for global conqu est. In 2003 we had the Bush family in the White House, Dick Cheney as Vice President and Colin Powell as Secretary o f State, and a United States international 'coalition' went to 'war' with Iraq. In 1991 the Bush family was in the White House, Cheney was Defense Secretary and Powell was head o f the US forces as Chairman o f the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a United States international coalition' went to war with Iraq. If you add together the ca sualties from the initial conflict, and the ec ono mic sanctions and b ombing that followed, the '91 Gulf war cost the lives of a million Iraqi children, even without the c hild casualties, immediate a nd long-term, of the invasion o f 2003. The Gulf War of father George Bush, like the latest one fronted by his idiot son, was a c oldly manipu lated set-up. The apparent cause was a dispute between Iraq and Kuwait, a c oun try that has been und er British and Illuminati control back to the days when the econo mic potential of oil was discovered. Iraq h as one of the world' s larges oil deposits and h as attracted the c onstant attention o f the US and British elite. In fact, coun tries like Kuwait, Iraq and o thers in the Midd le East, were c reated by the British and their fellow European po wers drawing lines in the sand. Kuwait is a dictatorship, an u np leasant one, and the idea that the Gulf War was to 'free' Kuwaitis just as ridiculous as the c laim that the 2003 in vasion o f Ir aqi was to 'liberate' the people. After the first Gulf conflict what happened? Saddam was left in po wer in Iraq and the Kuwaiti royal dictatorship was brough t back with American and British support to continue their policy o f the murder and torture of 'dissidents' who campaign for little luxuries like freedom and a say in the running o f their own coun try. Saddam Hussein, the designated villain o f both conflicts, was in fact one of the gang. He was a member of the e lite Safari Club, which b egan as a consortium also involving SAVAK , the CIA-conn ected secret police of the Shah o f Ir an; Anwar Sadat, the later-assassinated. President of Egyp t and Saudi Arabian Intelligence. It has been implicated in coun tless coup s in Africa to further its goals and is heavily invo lved in arms trading and supp ly. Out of the Safari Club came the Pinay Circle, or Le Cercle, named after the French Prime Minister, Antoine Pinay. He was a major Illuminati asset who attended the first official meeting o f the Bilderberg Group at Oosterbeek, Holland, in May 19 54. Others involved with Le Cercle included the Habsburg family, a major Illumin a ti bloodline. To g ive you an idea of its make-up. and range of influence, the Le Cercle membership h as included Nicholas Elliot, a department head at Britain ’ s MI6; William Colby, a former director of the CIA; Colonel Botta of Swiss Mili t ary Intelligence; Stefano Della Chiaie, a leading member of the Italian Secret Service a nd Giulio Andreotti, Henry Kissinger's friend, the former Italian Prime Minister fr om the notoriousP-2 Freemasonry lodge. No doub t neo-con Michael Ledeen kno ws him well; Silva Munoz, a former minister for the fascist Franco in Spain and a member of the e lite secret society within the Roman Catholic network, Opus Dei; Franz Josef Strauss, the German Defence Minister; and Monsignore Brunello, an agent to the Vatican. In America, one of the Le Cercle fronts is alleged to b e the CIA-backed Heritage Foundation in Washington. Look at the potential for such an o rganisation to b e a c oordinating force between apparently different agencies and coun tries to achieve a comm on aim. Le Cercle a nd the Safari Club are basically the same e ntity, which is why, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Augu st 16th)990, it was the CIA w ho suppo rted the Ba'ath Party in Iraq and o rchestrated a c oup that installed Saddam Hussein as dictator in 19 68, just.i1S they did with Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. But, it is important to remember that everyon e is expendable to the ca use if tl1eir subsequent removal best serves the agenda. Bush - Saddam connections Father George. Bush h ad more than po litical associations with Saddam Hussein b efore the 1991 Gulf conflict. Bush h ad considerable invo lvement with the Bank o f Credit and Comm erce International (BCC I), acc ording to the Chicago journalist, Sherman Skolnick, who made a detailed study o f the bank. The BCC I, or the Bank o f Crook s and Criminals International as it was rightly d ubbed, crashed in 1991 amid an enormous-scandal that cost its customers multi-billi ons. One of the c ontrollers of the bank Khalid bin"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 79 Mahfouz. He was named by the Clinton State Department as fund er of Mr of Osama bin Laden and h e was also an investor in Harken Energy, one of boy George Bush's oil companies {see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). James Bath ~ a c lose friend o f George W. Bush for decades was the Texas representative of Bin Mahfouz. The purpose of the BCC I was to wash d rug money and p rovide a channel for the funding by gov ernment agencies like the CIA of the terrorist group s that are used to serve the a genda. Sherman Skolnick h as claimed p ub licly, includ ing an interview on Radio Free \" America, that father Bush, Saddam Hussein and o thers, used the BCC I to split $250 billion in oil 'kick b acks', the skimming-off of money p aid by western o il companies in the Gulf. Other researchers and insiders have said the same. Skolnick claims that the records implicating Bush in d eals with Sad d am and former Panama President Manuel Noriega were in the hands of the Bank o f England and that the money was channelled through the BCC I and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) branches in the USA. Henry Gonzales, the chairman o f the House Banking Committee, identified links between the BCCI and BNL. Skolnick told interviewer Tom Valentine on Radio Free America: \"[The BCCI] ... was formed in the 19 70swith seed money from the Bank of America, the largest shareholders of which a re the Rothschilds of Chicago, Paris, London a nd ,Switzerland , ..

BCC I financed the Democratic Party in the United States and arranged dea ls for Republicans outside the United States. \"1 Skolnick said records detailing the a lleged Bush-Saddam deals were held in the Chicago b ranch o f the BCC I, which was seized by the Federal gov ernment in 19 88. He went on: \"The same bank has records s howing joint business ventures b e tween General Manue l Noriega, former dictator of Panama I and George Bush. In January of 1990, the Federal prosecutor in Tampa had former top o fficials of Florida's branch on trial. They were a llowed to e scape p rison with only a slap on the wrist and a small penalty. Here's why: they told the Justice Department that if they were go ing to p rison, they had documents from their bank s howing that George Bush h ad p rivate bu siness ventures through their ban k with a series of dictators including no t only Saddam and Noriega, but others as well ... \" ...

One of the loud est voices calling for the 2003 invasion o f Ir aq was the Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, a man whose inability to tell the truth n ever ceases to stagger. Yet this s ame Rumsfeld was sent to meet Saddam Hussein by the Reagan-Bush White House in 1 983 to arrange for the supply o f chemical and b iological weapon s to Iraq for the war against Iran, which Iraq started in 1 980 and continued for eight devastating y ears. These. US-supp lied 'weapon s' included anthrax and bu bonic plague c ultures. Conspiracy theory? No, no, this information is contained in d eclassified US S tate Department documents that came to light in late 2002 . Rumsfeld's meeting with Saddam, prece ded by a warm handshake, was part of the Reagan-Bush (in o ther words Bush) policy o f close c oop eration with the Iraqi dictator. The documents reveal that the United States increased arms supp lies to Saddam even after he had u sed US-supp lied po ison gas against the Kurds in 1987 and 1 988. 3 President Boy George Bush and Tony Blair constantly repeated in 'justifying' the 2003 invasion o f Ir aq that Saddam had u sed chemical weapon s \"against his own p eople\" when, in truth, the US and Britain h ad supplied the means to do it. This US suppo rt for Saddam continued for seven y ears and on ly a week b efore Iraq invaded Kuwait in 19 90, the US ambassador to Baghd ad assured h im that the then President father George Bush \"wanted b etter and d eeper relations\". An investigation in 1994 by the Senate Banking Committee disclosed that dozens of biological agents were shipped to Iraq in the mid ~ 80s und er licence from the US Comm erce Department. These included strains of anthrax that Rumsfeld, Bush and Powell cited in 2003 as one of the reasons they must invade Iraq. A month before Rumsfeld's visit t o Baghd ad, George (Illuminati) Shu ltz, the Secretary o f State, was given intelligence reports showing that Iraqi troops were resorting to \"almost daily u se of CW (chemical weapon s) against the Itanians\".4 Rumsfeld claimed h e had \"cautioned\" Saddam abou t the use of chemical weapon s at the 1983 meeting. So why supply them in the first place ? Once a gain Rumsfeld is lying. Of course he is; he's s peaking isn't he? When Rumsfeld's lie was contradicted by the declassified State Department note of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 80 his meeting with Saddam, a Pentagon spok esman said that Mr Rumsfeld issued the ca ution to Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister. If you are caugh t out on on e lie, what do you do ? You tell another. Howard Teicher, a former National Security Coun cil official during the Reagan Administration, said in a sworn affidavit that the United States \"actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the Iraqis with billi ons of dollars of credits, by p roviding milit ary intelligence a nd advice to the Iraqis, and by closely monitoring third coun try arms s ale to Iraq to make sure Iraq h ad the military weapon ry required\".5 Teicher said that William Casey, the former CIA D irector, supp lied Saddam with cluster bomb through a front company in Chile. Who sup plied North Korea with nuclear technology? Donald Rumsfeld's company But while we a re on the subject of Rumsfeld, there's more. In the year 2000 , he was a director of the European engineering giant ABB when it sold nuclear reactors to North Korea in a deal worth $200 milli on and this was the same nuclear capability cited by Rumsfeld, Bush and Co in 2 002 as proof that North Korea was part of an \"axis of evil' that had to b e c onfronted. 6 Rumsfeld was on the ABB board for eleven y ears until he left to join the Bush administration in 2001 . At the time of the nuclear deal ABB's then chief executive Goran Lindahl, announ ced a \"wide-ranging , long - term coop eration agreement\" with the comm unist government. The type of reactors inv o lved p rodu ce pluton ium that needs refining b efore it can be weapon ised. One US cong ressman and critic of the North Korean regime described the reactors as \"nuclear bomb factories\".7 When qu estioned abou t this outrageous hypocrisy, Rumsfeld's office ~ said that the defense secretary d id no t \"reca ll it being b rought before the board at any time\".8 Still more diplomatic amnesia. Sorry, lying. A spok esman for ABB said that all board members were informed abou t the deal. It is worth emphasising this again: These liars and cheats are the very same people who h ave told you what happened on September 11th, who did it, and ho w. Father Bush fun ded Saddam The public were a lso no t told that it was the Bush gov ernment that had fund ed the very Saddam m ilitary that father George sent US troop s to fight in 1991 . Much o f the funding was channelled through a branch o f Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Atlanta. Cong ressman Henry Gonzales expo sed the BNL scandal in 1 991 after he noticed that this little branch o f the Italian gov ernment bank h ad loaned Iraq $5 billi on. This money was dispatched to Sad d am after November 1989 when the Bush \"White House guaranteed b ank loans to Iraq if they were to b e used for the purchase for US farm produ cts. If Saddam defaulted, the US taxpayers picked up the tab for\" the loan and, since he was always defaulting, that was obviously g oing to b e the o u tcome from the start. As planned, Saddam spent the money on arms, including purchases from the Matrix Churchill machine tool company in England. This company was the subject of a court case in which the British g overnment was implicated. Althou gh many US investigators warned Bush that the money was being u sed for arms, the loans were allowed \"to continue. The a im was obv ious\" when you look o f the other evidence. Bush was doing the same as his father did with Hitler. He was fund ing an aggressor so he c ould start-a war with him. Some of the money was s pent on buy ing p oison g as from a CIA front called Cardeon Indu stries in Chile. 9 When the war started, Saddam defaulted on the loans and the US taxpayers footed the bill for Ir aq to fight their own sons and d augh ters. The c over-up o f this, as usual, led to the targeting o f the small fry. The whole thing was blamed on the bank manager at the BNL's Atlanta branch, Christopher P. Drogo ul, who could n ever have sanctioned that sort of money without the highest authorisation. A guy called Peter Kawaja said in an American radio interview that he was involved at one time with Produ ct Ingredient Techno logy in Boca Raton, Florida, and with Ishan Barbou ti International (IBI), the builder of Pharma 150 , the c hemical and b iolog ical weapon s complex in Rabta, Libya.10 His experiences led him to investigate what was going on . He said h e went to the CIA and FBI and op erated for the US gov ernment under a c ode name because they told him these people were international terrorists and that they were going to p rosecute them. Kawaja said that he did his own investigation, however, which included \"bugging telephon e lines, buildings, and certain o ther locations throughout the United States\". He said h e intercepted comm unications to the Comm od ity Credit Corporation and the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Kawaja said h e saw the letters of credit of the BNL, which , came from Switzerland, and a lot of other comm unications regarding the Gulf War that was to come\" .. ~ e said h e recorded calls going to and coming from Baghd ad, to and from the United States and Londo n, CIA, FBI, FBI coun terintelligence, US Customs, certain p oliticians and nu merous other individuals. \"This is my information \", he said in the radio interview. \"It is not second -hand.\" US District Judg e Marvin Shoob said the c laim that the Atlanta branch o f the BNL could 'loan $5 billi on to Iraq without the a pproval of the head o ffice in Rome c ould on ly come out of \"never-never land\". The judge said o f manager Drogou l and four other employees at the branch: "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 81 “[They] were pawns or bit players in a far larger< and wider ranging sophisticated conspiracy that involved BNL-Rome a nd po ssibly large American a nd foreign corporations and the g overnments of the United St ~ , England ; Italy and Iraq ... smoke is c oming ou t of every window. I have to conclude that the building is on fire.\" 11 This is the last thing the father Bush administration and the Illuminati wanted to h ear. Judg e Shoob was removed from the ca se a nd replace d by Judg e Ernest Tidwell, who refused to allow any evidence to b e presented abou t the CIA and the Bush-White House involvement in the bank. Drogo ul was persuaded to plead g uilty even though h e wasn't. The fund ing o f th ~ Iraqi arms build-up b efore the Gulf War and the supplying o f weapon s invo lved the Bush administration, the British gov ernment, the Italian gov ernment, the Soviet Union and o ther leading governments and corporations controlled by the Illuminati. One of the network o f Illuminati private 'armies' is called the Wackenhu t Corporation and investigative journalist John Conn olly expo sed in a Spy Magazine a rticle12 that Wackenhu t had b een involved in the a rming o f Ir aq before the first Gulf War by transporting the means to p rodu ce the very chemical weapon s that father George Bush and Co were saying po sed such a tl1! ~ at. to. the world. George Wackenhu t, a former FBI operative, started the c ompany with o ther FBI associates in 19 54 and its board h as been p acked ov er the years with recruits from the FBI, CIA and the military. It has s ince merged with Group 4 Falck, the world's second largest provider of Security Services. George Wackenhu t is a long -time friend o f father George Bush and h as contributed g enerously to his political campaigns and those of boy George a nd Florida gov ernor Jeb Bush. Journalist John Conno lly wrote: •.... After a six-month investigation, in the course of which we spoke to more than 300 p eople, we believe we know that the [Wackenhut] t ruck did contain e quipment necessary for the manu facture of chemical weapons and where it was headed [in the \" Winter of 1990 ]: t o Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And the Wackenhut Corporation - a publicly traded company with strong ties to the CIA and federal contracts worth $ 200 million a year was making sure Saddam would be getting h is equipment intact.\" 13 The supp ly o f weapon s and money invo lved another familiar name, Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State a nd National Security Advisor to Richard Nixon at the time of the Watergate scandal and a genocide maniac who is now threatened with arrest in several coun tries for war crimes. As early as 1984 his company Kissinger Associates was arranging for loans from the BNL to Iraq to finance its arms purchases from a little-kno wn subsidiary o f Fiat, which was headed by major Illuminati initiate Giovanni Agnelli. Charles Barletta, a former Justice Department investigator, was quo ted abou t this in the US S potlight newspaper on November 9th 1992 . The report said: \"Barletta a dded that Federal probers had collected do zens of such incriminating case h istories about the Kissinge r firm.

The war dragged on for eight years amid appalling suffering and loss of life. But it was good for the oil, banking and armament cartel (all controlled by the Illuminati) and for divide' and rule. In 1990 -91 Saddam would b e used again, kno wingly o r otherwise, to start another war in the Gulf, another conflict planned long b efore. Author and researcher George C. Andrews reported: \"A little known fact about the Gulf War is that one month before o ur Declaration of War on December 15, 1990, Secretary of State James Baker, signed the US A rmy Report from the 3 52nd Civil Affairs Comm and on the New Kuwait [unclassified, and therefore available to those interested].

[Exactly the same was done b efore the 'war' in Afghanistan a nd the 2003 invasion of Iraq.] \"Why have none o f his political opponents thou ght of asking the o bvious que stions ... [such a s] ...

She said the Bush gov ernment had \"no o pinion on the Arab-Arab conflict like you r border disagreement with Kuwait\". Glaspie a dded that she had instructions from the President to seek b etter relations with Iraq. She then left for a summ er holiday, another indication to Saddam that the Americans were not interested in h is plan to invade Kuwait. 15 Tuning is everything to the Illuminati. They h ave a specific a genda with a specific timescale. As former Blair cabinet minister Clare Short has s aid, the date of the second invasion o f Ir aq was kno wn long b efore it happened and events were manipulated to hit the deadline. This was the reason for the weapon s inspectors of H ~ Blix b eing d enied the time to complete their inspections. It was the same in 1991 . Suddenly father Bush changed h is s tance a nd labelled Saddam \"the new H itler\". He said the Second World War had shown that appeasement of such people was not the a nswer. He might have a dded that it is also no t the a nswer to fund bo th sides in a conflict and to help finance Hitler's war machine, as his father had don e. For those who kn ew the game plan, it was easy to see what was ~ happening. Bush announ ced on November 8th 1 ~ 90 that the forces in Saudi Arabia would b e substantially increased.1pe 'defensive' force was now to switch to o ffensive mode and the Bush 'UN forces' attacked on Wednesday, January 16 th 199 1, as planned all along . 120,000 air sorties were unleashed on Iraq, mostly, it turned ou t, against civilian areas. Bush's Chairman o f the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, who h as ancestral links with many old American and British families, headed the operation. The number of dead and injured from the bombing o f Ir aq, the resulting disease a nd the econo mic sanctions can h ardly b e c omprehended. Cond itions for the c ivilians in Iraq h ave been unimaginable under the econo mic stranglehold that .was imposed through the United Nations by America and Britain after the Gulf War. Home of the brave ... The 'wars' against Iraq\" as with Afghanistan; canno t truly b e described as wars at all My und erstanding o f a war; is that you n eed two sides and und er that definition the Gulf War was not a war, and soldiers have described it as a \"turkey shoo t\", which is precisely what happened. The Iraqi army, mainly conscripts who had no choice, may h ave been armed by the US and Britain, but not with the level of firepower that they have. Iraqi men, women and children were subjected to the most intense bombing blitz in h uman history. At least tens of thou sands died in the bombardment and while the media were showing u s pictures provided by the US military o f 'smart bombs' that could target a building and go through a toilet windo w, the truth that was being supp ressed d aily by the military censors was very d ifferent. At least 93% of the bombs that rained from the Iraqi skies were not 'smart' and that's according to the Pentagon 's own nu mbers, and 70 % of them m issed their target. Other civilian targets were struck und er the guise of being military o r weapon - making centres. A civilian bomb shelter was hit beca use \"intelligence told u s it was a military headqu arters\". Reporter Peter Arnett, then with CNN , visited the c ivilian bomb shelter in Iraq and found it was ... a bomb shelter. He a lso v isited a milk factory bo mbed b eca use it was a \"chemical weapon s factory\" and found it was ... a milk factory. In fact he had b een there a year before a nd it was produ cing ... milk. Mistakes? Please. Look again at how the Airman magazine described the ca pabilities of the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq: \"On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake, California. The images it gathered were so clear that an e lectro op tical image stand s out next to an FjA-18 fighter. An infrared image showed where concrete had cooled do wn from the shadow of a C-130 that had recently taken off.\" 16 There a re no mistakes abou t locations when you . have that level of surveillance techno logy . Thousands of Iraqi soldiers were buried alive in 19 91 as 'UN ' forces used bu lldozers to fill in their trenches in blatant contravention o f international law. But nothing encaps u lates the mentality o f these deeply sick p eople currently waging the war on terrorism' better than the a lmost unimaginable a ttacks on the \"Highway o f Death'''. The Iraqi army was in retreat in the wake of the air bombardment and h eaded ou t of Kuwait across the border to Basra. With them were c ivilians and p risoners.

An International War Crimes Tribunal found President George Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Secretary o f State James Baker and military leaders Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkop f, guilty o f war crime. But what was don e a s a result? Nothing. These a re the people who h ave the a udacity to pu t others on trial for war crimes, like the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. Dark kn ights The Illuminati Queen o f England was most grateful to these maniacs, however, and she made Bush's milit ary chiefs Colin Powell and \"Stormin'\" Norman Schwarzkop f, (the c omm ander of Operation Desert Storm) Hono rary Knights of the British Empire. Schwarzkop f has lied through his teeth abou t the 'mystery' disease kno wn as Gulf War Synd rome that has afflicted v eterans of that slaugh ter. His father would h ave been p roud o f him. Norman Schwarzkop f senior had b een an important player in the British-American Intelligence c oup called Operation AJAX, which removed the Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mohamm ad Mossadegh in 1 953. The Illuminati wanted h im ousted after he nationalised oil production and removed the oil cartel's power over his people. The British blood line Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was also behind the c oup . Mossadegh was replace d by the dictatorship o f the Shah o f Ir an who reversed the oil nationalisation (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). It is rare for the Queen to g ive Hono rary Knighthoods and o ther honours to p eople outside the Comm onwealth, but those she has chosen read like a n Illuminati Who's Who. The titles are dubb ed \"hono rary\" beca use the American Constitution forbids the acceptance of titles from the monarch o f a foreign state withou t the permission o f Cong ress. So few of these hon ours are given b eca use, as a British gov ernment official put it: \"One must not debase the c urrency.\" I wond er if you think the following n ames debase the currency: George Bush, the paedop hile, child killer, mass murderer, Satanist and close friend o f the Windsors, was made Hono rary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, as was Ronald Reagan, Bush's lapdog 'President'; Henry Kissinger, the 'orchestrator of genocide on a monumental scale worldwide, was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George a t a c eremony at Windsor Castle Brent Scowcroft, an executive of Kissinger Associates and top adviser to George Bush, was ma-de an Hono rary Knight of the British Empire; and Casper Weinberger, another Bush clone who was charged with o ffences in the Iran-Contra arms scandal and p ardon ed by Bush, is another Hono rary Knight of the British Empire. After the September 11th atrocities, the insider mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, was appo inted an Hono rary Knight Comm ander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for doing nothing more than the job h e was paid h andsomely to do . So why was he such a c hosen on e? For some more, realistic background to 'hero' Giu\\i,ani and his activities s ee the website of Robert Lederman, a street artist in New Y ork and a regular columnist for the Greenwich Village Gazette. 17 Burying the truth The c rimes for which the Bush family and their masters and associates are respon sible rarely comet to light beca use the media, at the top level, is controlled by the Illuminati and most Journalists either don 't realise they are pawns in a game or they accept it to p rotect their careers. The a ccoun ts are legion o f how evidence and footage that expo se the lies, especially in wartime, are banned o r confiscated. One e xample during the 1991 Gulf Slaugh ter was when the American TV networks NBC and CB S refused to air pictures s hot in Iraq o f the destruction o f civilian areas that revealed the Bush gov ernment and military acc oun ts to b e a grotesque fiction - just as they are In the 'war on terrorism'. The story was blocked by the President of NBC Michael Gartner and the produ cers offered it to CB S, where Tom Bettag, the .' Executive Editor of the CB S Evening News, said on e of them would appear on the show the following d ay to tell their story. That evening Bettag was sacked and the story bu ried. This is the real background to the TV news. 18 Footage of the Highway o f Death was also supp ressed. Father Bush's lies abou t Iraqi troop d eployments in Kuwait, provable by satellite images, were a lso n ever shown. This s atellite 'loophole in the lies' was the reason why the US gov ernment purchased all rights to satellite pictures of Afghanistan while that coun try was s ubjected to another insane American and British bombing on slaught. We shou ld note, of course, that having said that the CIA-installed dictator Saddam Hussein was a there it to the world, and with the Iraqi' army' destroyed, father George Bush sudd enly called an end to the 'war' and p ulled the troop s out leaving Saddam still intact. As Norman Schwarzkop f said with an air of disappointment: \"We c ould h ave c ompletely closed the doo r and made it a battle of annihilation ... [it was] literally abou t to b ecome the battle of Cannae, a battle of"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 84 annihilation.\" Ah, never mind Norman, but you see you r president and those who controlled him wanted Hussein to stay pu t, or at least appear to, so they could play that card again more than a decade later. Bombing is not enough ... The public believe the Gulf War ended in 1 991, but in fact it was only b eginn ing. Using the 'threat' of Sad dam, the 'threat' Bush chose not to remove when it was there for the taking, the United States and the United Kingdom, the diabolical duo o f world terrorism, led a campaign o f 'sanctions' against Iraq. They also continued, unreported, the bombing o f civilian targets, a policy maintained by the Clinton and boy George Bush administrations. Investigative journalist John Pilger wrote of a woman h e met in no rthern Iraq who had lost her husband, children and father-in-law w h en they were bombed by two US planes while tending their sheep on op en land.9 The sanctions against a c oun try that imports 70% of its food were imposed on a people a lready d evastated by the mass bombing o f their electricity, water supply, transport and sewer systems, which the British and American gov ernments refused to allow them to rebuild. A public health team from Harvard University went into Iraq soon after the official bombing and estimated that over 46,000 children u nder the a ge of five had already d ied by Augu st 1991 b eca use of the destruction o f Ir aq's infrastructure. 2o But the nightmare was only b eginn ing. Writer Thomas J Nagy expo sed the c oldly calculated way the US military targeted the Iraqi. water supp ly in the full knowledge of the gruesome effect this would h ave on the people, especially children. In an article headed \"The Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the US Intentionally Destroyed Iraq's Water Supp ly\", he wrote that the United States knew the c ost that civilian Iraqis, mostly children, would p ay, and it went ahead anyway.\":! Nagy, who lectures at the School of Business and Public Management at George Washington University un covered do cuments from the US Defense Intelligence Agency that reveal a stunn ing disregard for human life. A document dated January 22nd 19 91 says: \"Iraq d epends on importing specialized equ ipment and some chemicals to p urify it ~ water supp ly ... Failing to secure supplies will result in a shortage of pure drinking water for much o f the p opulation. This c ould lead to increased incidences, if not epidemics, of disease ... [t he] most likely diseases during [the] next 90 da ys [include ]: diarrhoea l diseases (particularly c hildren); acute respiratory illnesses (colds and influenza); typho id; hepatitis A (particularly c hildren); measles, diphtheria and pertussis (particularly c hildren); meningitis, including meningococcal (particularly c hildren cholera (possible, but less likely).\" 22 This is a massive violation o f the Geneva Conv ention, which says: \"It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian p opulation, such as food stuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the c ivilian pop ulation o r to the a dverse party, whatever the motive.\" The US/British-led UN sanctions against I have don e a ll of these things. By 19 95 Secretary o f State Madeleine Albright was forced to admit on the Sixty Minutes television p rogramm e that these sanctions had already cost the lives of half a milli on Iraqi children and that was only up to then. Albright said on Sixty Minutes that she though t the c onsequences for those children were worth it to stop Saddam. That is stunning enoug h, but, of course, by invading Iraq a second time in 20 03 they. were saying that the sanctions and all that death and suffering was for nothing. This is the mentality that controls our world. A report by Richard Garfield o f Columbia University concluded that the increase in child d eath rates in Iraq was virtually u nique in modem health studies.23 Denis Halliday, coordinator of the so-called 'Oil- for-Food Programm e' resigned in September 1998 and spok e out against the genocidal effects of the sanctions. His successor, Hans von Spon eck, did the same in February 2000 . The US gov ernment respon se was to try to discredit t he two men. The 'oil for food ' farce provided the oil cartel with cheap Iraqi oil. Forty p er cent of Iraq's oil, exchanged to buy food, ended up in the United States at kno ck-down p rices because of the sanctions imposed by the United States and Britain to the immense benefit of the Illuminati oil cartel. The forces of freedom and 1 iberty h ave a lso b een bo mbing Iraq with weapon s containing spent uranium and this has led to the birth o f babies with ho rrible deformities and d isease (Figures 8 and 9 ). Since this bombardment began in 1991 Iraq h as developed the world's highest rate of childhood leukaemia. At the same time there was an embargo on medicines and techno logy that would h elp to reduce the radiation. The genocidal attacks on the Iraqi popu lation b egan with 'Repub lican' father George Bush, continued with 'Democrat' Bill Clinton, and within a month o f taking o ffice a t ,the start of 2001 , George W. Bush, another ,'Republican', was ordering (being told to o rder) more \"routine\" bombing o f Ir aq: In h11 th they are just lackeys for the same one-party state and that's why the policies never change no matter who is in the White House.

When po ison g as was used to pu t down an Iraqi rebellion against colonial rule, Churchill said: \"I do no t understand this squeamishness abou t the use of gas. I am story in favou r of using [it] against uncivilised tribes.\" 28 A soldier who fought with the British army in the Gulf War of 1991 told me that chemical weapon s were used against the Iraqi troop s in that conflict. Robert Coop er, a former diplomat and p ersonal assistant for foreign affairs to British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, admitted in The Post-Modern S tate and the World Order: \"We need to g et used to the idea of dou ble standards ... [in o ther words] ... get over it, we a ~ hypo crites (but powerful ones).\" Cooper said that the 1991 conflict with Iraq was to maintain control of oil supplies and\" ... the reasons for fighting the Gulf War were not that Iraq h ad v iolated the norms of international behaviour ... \" Exactly.

Even so, Scott Ritter, former head of UN w eapon s inspectors in Iraq, made it clear that by the late 1990 s Saddam's regime was no threat.

Herbert Agar You can't say that civilization don 't advance, however, for in every war they k ill you in a new way. Will Rogers After the invasion o f Afghanistan in 200lJlin which at least 5,000 civilians were killed for no o ther reason than o il and Illuminati conqu est, they b egan to p repare the way for the next stage in the plan for global domination. It was back to Iraq o r back again to their ancient headqu arters in the land o f Sumer and Babylon (Figu re 10 ). Boy George Bush was given the speec h to read (as best he c an) for the State of the Union (it's s hit) address on January 28 th 20 02. This contained the phrase, the \"axis of evil\", written by n eo-con David Frum of the American Enterprise Institute. It referred to Iraq, Iran and North Korea, three c oun tries s pecifically n amed in the September 2000 document produced for Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Co by the Project for the New American Century. First on the list was Iraq and the lies began to flood from the White House, the Pentagon and Downing Street in an effort to sell an invasion to the public. They h ad to justify the war with spurious claims abou t 'weapon s of mass destruction' and also po rtray th ~ 'victory' as the liberation o f grateful Iraqis, freed by American h eroes. This was important beca use the better the spin in Iraq the ea sier the next invasion would b e to d eliver. In this endeavou r they were suppo rted magnificently by the American television n etworks. I was watching CNN in America on the day the statue of Sad d am Hussein was famously pu lled to the ground by US troop s amid crowds of cheering Iraqis in Baghd ad. Or, at least, that is what they told me I was seeing. CNN stayed live on the statue for some two hou rs waiting for this event to take place in the square right in front of the Palestine Hotel, which just happened to b e home to the international journalists and TV crews. It was all a set up. The TV pictures focussed on the c lose- up o f the statue and th ~ cheering people, but a wide shot revealed that only a handful of Ir aqis were there a nd the rest of the square was empty (Figu res 11 and 12 ). Many o f these \"cheering Iraq is\" were conn ected to the CIA-fund ed Iraqi National Cong ress of Ahmed Chalabi, who is the US pupp et-of-choice to 'lead' occupied Iraq. The whole event was carefully planned and stage-managed to p rovide a defining moment of the 'war' in the minds of the masses: Iraq h ad b een liberated from opp ression by the glorious United States (played by John Wayne). Dr Susan Block, an author and sex educator, compared the scene to a rape: \"The supreme victory for the rapist is proof that his victim 'enjoyed' it. Though he may force h is way into her property, demolish h er home, murder her loved ones, pillage h er belong ings, though he may terrify and humiliate he r, beat and ba tter her, break her bones and tear her flesh, spill her blood, wound her organs and lay waste to he r very s oul, if, in the midst of the rape, between tears and shrieks of agony, if his victim shou ld, for a moment, for some reason, any reason, if she shou ld smile, or, better yet, orgasm, the rapist is redeemed; he is even (in h is mind) heroic ...’’ .. . .. And still the cozily embedd ed mainstream m edia keep p laying the image of the toppling statue a nd the smiling Iraqis. CNN might as well be an chored b y Ari Reischer [the White House press s pokesman]. The jacked-up n ewscasters revel in the soft-core porn o f war, 'tastefully' showing very little o f the rampant hardcore d eath a nd d ismemberment, just lots of handsome, stalwart troops and b eguiling, brown-faced grins that comm unicate: Freedom! Liberation! Smiles! They love u s! We may have brutally, sys tematically raped their coun try (and the rape continue s), but they want it! They really want us to bo mb the shit out of them. They like that. .. 1 Yes, the media fell for the propaganda a s usual and, indeed, many US network executives and o wners were involved in the plot.

Everything is s pin and aimed at the cameras and the minds of the people. It has nothing to do with truth o r facts. Journalist Robert Fisk reported on ho w American troop s opened fire on the ca r of Quiz al-Selman, a Danish engineer in Baghd ad.

She said that a radio host on MSNBC called Michael Savage was outraged that she dared to speak with the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade abou t why they do what they do ; why they are prepared to sacrifice themselves for what they call freedom fighting and o thers call terrorism.

Many h ave mouths the size of the planet and b rains the size of a pea, but they are telling America what to think, or rather not to. In 199 1, some ca lled for nuclear attacks on Iraq. \"How can you d iscuss, how can you solve a nything\", Banfield said, \"when attacks from a mere radio flak is what America hears on a regular basis, let alone a t the gov ernment level?\" If this kind o f attitude is prevailing, she a dded, forget discussion and forget diplomacy. What does that leave us with? War. Banfield highlighted the truly disgrace ful Fox/Fix News of Rupert Murdoch. She talked o f the \"Fox effect\" with its one-sided p atriotism and lack o f anything remotely resembling journalism. Cable news operators had wrapped themselves in the American flag and p atriotism, she said, and targeted a ce rtain d emographic audience. It had b een v ery lucrative a nd you could already see the e ffects on the other networks as they hired more a nd more right wing contributors. All of this was beca use of Fox, she said, and its s ucce sses in taking viewers from other networks. What she is s aying is that next ti me they go to war the 'news' coverage will be e ven worse. Institutionalised racism I was in America for part of the 'war' and I saw the c oun tless emotionally charged stories abou t US troop s who d ied in Iraq. \"Terrible news\", I heard CNN say. \"Two US soldiers have been k illed in a missile a ttack.\" There were interviews with the families of troop s who would no t be c oming ho me a live a nd the interviewers said ho w awful it must be for them. I und erstand this, but never did I hear a though t for what the families of dead Iraqi civilians must be going through. The parents who saw their children blown apart and children who watched the same happen to their mums and d ads. Dead Iraqi civilians are not \"terrible news\", it seems; they are unfortunate a nd un avoidable \"collateral damage\". I saw a Christian TV channel suspend its programm ing to u rge the viewers to \"pray for our troop s\". No mention o f praying for Ir aqis. But then they are Muslims and why would the Christian g od give a shit abou t them? It sickens my stomach to see such b latant racism in the way this 'war', and all such 'wars', are portrayed. Do p eople with b rown faces not have e motions every b it as traumatic a nd un imaginable a s the relatives of US troop s? The troop s made the c hoice to go , the Iraqi and Afghan civilians had no such luxu ry. The United States is the leader of the 'free world'? It holds the high g round o f morality? Those who b elieve such b latant non sense drown in a cesspit of mass murder and self-cong ratulation. Let's hear it for the heroes ... Those 'heroic' troop s dropp ed an estimated 30 ,000 b ombs on Iraqis from the a ir alone a t a fantastic c ost in human suffering and financial outlay. This is a world that has billions living in poverty, yet every Tomahawk cruise missile c osts around a million d ollars and the overall military cost is closing in on 100 billi on do llars. They targeted a la11d in which some 60 p er cent of the 24 million p eople were children. I see nothing h eroic in that. The most famous victim of this fascist carnage was Ali Ismail Abbas, the 12- year-old who lost both his parents and bo th arms in the US and British bo mbing o f Baghd ad. He also suffered appalling burns to his body. \"It was midnight when the missile fell on u s\", he told Reuters at the Kindi Hospital. Thinking abou t his uncertain future, he a sked whether he could g et artificial arms. \"Can you help g et my arms back? Do you think the doctors can get me a nother pair of hands?\" Abbas asked. \"If I don 't get a pair of hands I will commit suicide\", he said with tears s pilling do wn his cheeks. The Reuters report continued:"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 94 \"His aun t, t hree cousins and three o ther relatives s taying with them were a lso killed in this week's missile strike$ on their hou se in Diala Bridge d istrict east of Baghdad.

An Iraqi nurse, Fatin Sharhah, wrote a letter to Bush and Blair that said: \"You h ave a ll this technology to b omb u s ... but you canno t spare one a ircraft for one ?a y to save a life?\" 12 Ah y es, but highlighting the story o f kids like Ali would no t support the US and British spin on their slaugh ter and so they ignore the suffering un til they are forced to act because the news is out. Then those who caused the suffering are portrayed as the good guy heroes helping a little c hild to 'live'. As doctors and aid agencies s tressed, Ali was only one of coun tless children who suffered similar consequences and for what? To allow Illuminati corporations to take over Iraq and its oil reserves and install themselves as the controlling force in the Midd le East. \"Ali's voice is one among milli ons of children's voices we're not hearing\", said Kathryn Irwin, a spok eswoman for the United Nations Children's Fund (UN ICEF).It is they who suffer and d ie, so p eople like the Bushes, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, Perle, Blair and the rest can impose the a genda they slavishly serve for a global fascist state. While the people suffered from their unimaginable injuries, the e ffects of the bombing closed most hospitals in I r aq and the looting that ensued from the c haos. Those that were open h ad few medicines and no electricity o r clean water. UNICEF spok eswoman, Kathryn Irwin said: \"Hospitals are having to d eal with ill children without the drugs they n eed and without water - how can you treat someone without clean water?\" I am sure Bush and Blair thou ght of nothing else. The International Committee of the Red Cross spok esman in Baghd ad, Roland Huguenin-Benjamin, said an average of 100 civilian casualties a day were being recorded at hospitals in the ca pital. 1 • Dr Hugu enin Benjamin and his s taff were also shocked by the numbers of dead and injured in a hospital in the town o f Hillah: \"That hospital where we had a chance of travelling with our own surgeon was utterly ov erwhelmed by h undreds of civilian casualties brought in, in just over 48 hou rs\", he said, \" And there were lots and lots of dead bod ies that were practically dismembered by the violence of the e xplosion they h ad b een subjected to.\"15 Here is s ome more of the reality b ehind the glorious victory that CNN , Fix News and the other mainstream networks fail to mention: \"Just a few weeks ago , Ayesha, a young and fragile Iraqi girl, was looking forward to he r seventh b irthday this c oming May.

Most did not see or hear such stories amid the triumphalism of a US president and vice president who bo th avoided the draft to Vietnam while supporting conscription for others. This is the president who said (no, his s criptwriters s aid) that when Iraqis look into the faces of American troop s, \"they see strength and k indness and good will\".24 No, they see death, destruction and o ccupation o f their land and they see a vicious, brainless, heartless front man in the White House who cares nothing o f their plight. A president who talked abou t \"we\" are making progress in the war when \"we\" were spending most of the time watching sport on the White House television as the devastation continued. But when you come from a family with a truly stupendou s record o f suppo rting fascism, abusing and murdering children, and removing those who g et in your way, the consequences for Iraqi civilians do no t enter the e quation (it's a mathematical term, George). In fact, it's a good laugh to them and I'm not kidding. If anyon e has a problem with that, they shou ld read some of my other book s. To confirm the real mindset behind this war, I watched Lt General Claudia Kennedy.(ret) on CNN respond ing to the American tank attack on the Palestine Hotel in Baghd ad that was home to the international journalists. She said she hop ed the military would not agonise over every such incident (no chance of that) because winning the war was all that really mattered. Once there was small arms fire from the hotel it beca me a \"legitimate military target\", she said, even thou gh it was-full of men, women and children. This is the mentality that is planning more such conqu ests. What was that Rumsfeld told his heroic troop s? \"With the liberation o f Ir aq, you h ave transformed the c oun try. But how you d id it will transform how w e defend ou r coun try in the 21st century.\" What does it matter to Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld o r Blair that people like 72-year-old Abid Hassan Hamoodi lost virtually his entire family when a US/UK 'coalition' (demolition) aircraft 'mistakenly' bombed his home in Basra? \"I lost 10 o f my family. I once lived in that hou se with six other relatives, now I am alone. Just before the invasion started much of my family c ame to stay in my home, it being made of reinforced concrete a nd very strong . There was my doctor son, my daughter - a microbiologist and her three sons. My other daugh ter is a medical consultant and she came with he r infants.

Now the coalition ha s k illed a family of highly qua lified p eople, irreplaceable people for Iraq.\" 25 Anyon e who suppo rted the war, or was indifferent to it, is respon sible for all that happened and continues to happen. I remember being on the 702 radio station in South Africa talking abou t the background to the war when a guy called \"Mike\" came on. This was an idiot of unbelievable magnitude. \"What planet are you on?\" was all he c ould say, igno ring every oppo rtunity to answer the question: \"What research h ave you don e into these matters?\" He e ven castigated the presenter for having me on the programm e to say such things. When p eople ask me how a few can control the world, Moron Mike often g ets a mention these days. If it wasn't for people like him - and there a re billions of them - non e of this would b e possible. Fodder in uniform (brain optional, but not encouraged) Many p eople of the Mike mentality are in the military o r \"the ca valry on the new A merican frontier\", as the Project for the New A merican Century d escribes them. They are a mixture of John Wayne wannabes; psychop aths who can h ide their sickness behind the c over of military legitimacy; those who g enuinely think they are serving their country while serving the Illuminati; and o thers who are basically d umb and h ave to be told what to do . Take Tyler Aholt, a member of a Naval construction force called the Seabees, who said this of the people protesting against the war: \"If they are not backing up those that are in charge of us, then in the long run, they're not backing u s up.\" Take a deep b reath and wait for the pun ch-line: \"I've c onsidered if some of the protesters even und erstand the whole idea of war: without war, how can you h ave peace? \" 26 As Einstein said: \"Only two things are infinite, the universe a nd hu man stupidity. And I am not so sure abou t the former.\" Then there was this guy reported in the UK Sunday Times: \"The Iraqis are sick p eople and we a re the c hemotherapy\", said Corporal Ryan Dupre. \"I am starting to h ate this coun try. Wait til l I get hold o f a friggin' Iraqi. No, I won't get hold o f one. I'll just kill him.\" 27 Stephen Eagle Funk, a 20-year-old marine reserve who refused to fight in Iraq, said that many o f his fellow recruits envied him when they thou ght he was going to b e sent into b attle. \"They would say things like, 'Kill a raghead for me - I'm so jealous,'\" he said. 28 Another soldier recorded by the BBC said: \"We godd a get this cargo up front, the soon er we get [it there], the soon er they can k ill some of these people that need k illin', the soon er we c an go home.\" 2Y In the same programm e ca me this gem from a boy soldier taking p art in the 'liberation': \"We bomb 'em, you kno w it's cool to me beca use I like e xplosions and stuff like that, but, like, I don 't get to see the a ctual explosion, and that's what I want to see, but I guess when we get closer to Baghd ad we'll get to see more of that.\"}l) Hey, Cap'n, I just killed 14 o f them there brown faces and my machine won't give me e xtended play, sir. A British soldier was arrested after staff in a pho to-processing store gave pho tographs to the police that indicate Britis4-ttroops tortured and sexually abused Iraqi prisoners of war. One shows a man stripped to the waist while suspended from a rope a ttached to a forklift truck. A soldier driving the truck is apparently laughing at his plight. Others appear to show an Iraqi man forced to p erform oral sex on a white soldier; two o thers forced to h ave anal sex; and two n aked Iraqis cowering on the ground. Officers from the Special Investigation Branch o f the Royal Military Police a rrested Gary Bartlam, a private in the First Battalion o f the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. He was on leave from the regiment stationed in Iraq's s econd city Basra a nd the port of Umm Qasr. The British army is as brutal as any o f them. Then there were the schoo lboy slogans the juveniles would write on their tanks and missiles. The brilliant writer, Arundhati Roy, said in the UK Guardian : \"On the steel torsos of their missiles, ado lescent American soldiers sc rawl colourful message s in childish handwriting: For Saddam, from the Fat Boy Posse. A building g oes down. A marketplace. A home. A girl who loves a bo y. A child who only ever wanted to p lay with h is older brother's marbles.\" 31 This is the sort of mentality, if you can call it that, which is fighting these wars of 'liberation'. Peter Arnett, the veteran war reporter sacked by NBC during the Iraqi invasion, told in the UK Daily Mirror of his experiences with such du mbos. He said that the United States was bringing enormous firepower to b ear to grind do wn the Iraqis and h e had seen it all before:"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 98 \"During the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, I entered a US-held town which h ad b een totally destroyed. The Viet Cong h ad taken over and were threatening the commander's building so he called down an artillery s trike which killed many of his own men. The Major with u s asked: 'How could this happen?' A soldier replied: 'Sir, we had to de stroy the town to save it'.\" 32 There were others in Iraq, however, that did allow the reality o f war to register, including this s oldier quo ted by the Sunday Times: \"Did you see a ll that?\" he a sked, his eyes filled with tears. \"Did y ou see that little baby girl? I carried h er body and bu ried it as best I could but I had no time. It really g ets to me to see children b eing killed like this, but we had no choice.\" 33 An und erstandable reaction, but of course he did have a choice. He had a c hoice not to b e there. Sergeant Ray Simon o f the US 3rd Infantry Division pu t it very well when h e said: \"We get up in the morning, go and kill peop le, stop for a lunch b reak, then kill some more, before going to sleep. This thing is getting ridiculous.\" 34 There a re decent, caring p eople in the milit ary who do b elieve they are helping p eople. But these genuine soldiers are being dup ed. Thou sands of civilians were killed by US and British forces and hund reds of thou sands injured - people like 20-year-old Akeel Kadhim, a student whose left leg was amputated. \"1 was s hot by the Americans\", he said, \"1 was running to another wound ed p erson, trying to save him ... We a re inno cent. We were not fighting. We were not resisting. I tried to save a n inno cent person. Why d id they shoo t me?\" 10 Can a 'smart' bomb b e used by an idiot? Apparently so. Once a gain the public were manipulated into b elieving in the inv incibility o f the 'smart' bombs that only hit their intended targets and arrogant military spok esmen like Brigadier General Vince Brook s, Deputy Comm ander at Central Comm and, would give journalists a daily dose of this condition ing with videos of their acc uracy. Meanwhile 'smart' bombs aimed for Ir aqi towns and cities were landing in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. Whenever they landed their lethal cargo in civilian areas or the US military shot civilians, Mr. Brook s and company b eca me much less talkative a nd they would imm ediately muddy the waters by saying, \"We don 't kno w exactly what happened, we a re investigating\". The idea is to hop e that no on e a sks again. The c ynicism reac hed new lows when a US missile landed in a Baghd ad market killing more than 60 in the Baghd ad district of Shu'ale a nd p eople like Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, General Richard Myers, sough t to blame it on the Iraqis. It could h ave been Iraqi anti-aircraft fire, they said, when there was non e by this time in the c onflict. UK Independent journalist, Robert Fisk, found a fragment of the missile with its code number and The Guardian newspaper reported: \" ... It has emerged - as a result of detective work on the Internet by a Guardian reader - that the e xplosion in a Baghdad market which killed more than 60 people last Friday was indeed caused b y a cruise missile and not an Iraqi anti-aircraft rocket as the US has s uggested. A metal fragment found a t the scene b y British journalist Robert Fisk c arried various markings, including 'MFR 96214 09'. This, our reader pointed out in an e mail, is a manufacturer's iden tification number known a s a 'cage code'. \"Cage code s c an be looked up on the internet (www .gidm.dlis.dla.mil). and keying in the nu mber 96214 traces the fragment back to a p lant in McKinne y, Texas, owned b y the Raytheon Company. Raytheon , whose h eadquarters are in Le xington, Massachusetts, aspires 'to be the most admired defense and aerospace sys tems s upp lier through world-class people and technology', according to its website (www .raytheon.com). It makes a vast array of military equ ipment, including the AGM129 cruise missile which is laun ched from B-52 bo mbers.\" 36 Lewis Libby, Dick Cheney's chief of staff, has shares in Raytheon Corp, which was selected with Kellogg Brown and Root to d estroy 'weapon s of mass destruction' in Iraq.3? Many d efence a nalysts have a greed that what happened at the Shu'ale market was almost certainly due to a Harm, which carries a warhead designed to explode into thousands of aluminium fragments, hence the injuries inflicted. In a similar incident, 21 Iraqi civilians were killed by a US/British missile unleashed by the forces of tyranny . A Red Crescent maternity hospital was bombed and in al-Janabiy, in the southeast of Baghd ad, pho tographer Patrick Baz, a veteran o f the conflict in Beirut in the 1980 s, found a farm pulverized by missiles with at least 20 d ead inside, including 11 children. 38 Members of the US 3rd infantry d ivision shot dead seven women and children travelling in their car at a checkpoint set up by the occupy ing force. A Washington Post reporter at the scene said ten were killed, includ ing five c hildren who appeared to b e young er than five years old. 39 The report described the vehicle a s a four-wheel-drive Toyo ta c ramm ed with the Iraqis' personal belongings. The military spok esman lied as always, saying - the ca r did no t respond to warning shots, but the Washington Post reporter said that Captain Ronny John son shou ted at his troops: \"You just fucking killed a family b eca use you d idn't fire a warning shot soon enough!\" 40 \"We do a ll we can to protect civilians\" "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 99 The indiscriminate killings of civilians were a constant feature of the invasion and these have continued since the occupation b egan.

He lost both his parents in the disaster. 41 At least 13 civilians were killed and scores injured when US troop s opened fire on a demonstration in the town o f Falluja, 35 miles from Baghd ad. The protestors were demanding that the milit ary leave the local school to allow the c hildren to return to their lessons. The US military, as always, said they h ad b een fired on , but witnesses said o nly stones were thrown. Most of the dead and injured were you ng p eople a nd the next day two more were shot dead by US bullets during a protest against the first killi ngs. In another incident, troops opened fire on a c rowd oppo sing the a ppo intment of a new pro- American (of course) gov ernor in the northern city o f Mosul. Ten d ied and around a hund red were injured. Hund reds more Iraqis have been k illed by US troop s s ince the 'major' war officially ended and the fodd er troop s have a lso continued to b e killed almost by the day at the time of writing. Civilians were not only hit, they were on many o ccasions targeted, as they always are. A Belgian n ews pho tographer, Laurent Van d er Stockt, working for the Gamm a a gency and und er contract for the New York Times Magazine, followed the advance of US Marines (3rd b attalion, 4th regiment) for three weeks, up to the taking o f Baghd ad on April 9th. Van d er Stockt has worked in many war zones, including the first Gulf War, Yugo slavia, Afghanistan, Chechny a, Africa a nd the Occupied Territories. He told the Le Monde newspaper in France of his experiences with the same troop s that would topp le the Saddam statue in front of the world media. Van d er Stockt said h e saw American troop s taking every oppo rtunity to tear down po rtraits of Saddam Hussein. \"They were doing this right in front of the local inhabitants, whose e lation q uickly v anished\", he said. \"The soldiers obviously didn't imagine that it was up to the Iraqis to b e doing this or that it was humiliating for them.\" 42 He told Le Monde       \"During the first few days, with colleagues from the New York Times and Newsweek, I tried to follow the convoys in a SUV by playing h ide-and-seek. We were spend ing a lot of time then with the 1 ,500 Marines of the 3 /4, comm anded b y Colone l Bryan P. McCoy ... t heir motto is 'Search a nd Kill'. The 'Kilo' unit is nicknamed 'Killer Kilo'. The words 'Carnivore' or 'Blind Killer' are pa inted on their tankls. McCoy c ould snap with a 'shame on you', a smile flashing a cross his face to the sniper who h ad just finished telling h im: 'I've got eight, sjr, but only five'. Literally mean ing: I've shot eight, but only five of them are dead'.\" 43 Van d er Stockt said h e had n ever seen a war with so few 'returns'. The Iraqi army was like a gho st, it barely existed, he said. Over the three weeks, he only saw the Iraqi' army' fire a few short-range rockets and a few shots. He saw deserted trenches, a dead Iraqi soldier lying n ext to a piece of bread and some old equipment. There was nothing that really made him feel that there was a real confrontation go ing on, nothing comparable to the \"massiveness of the means at the Americans' disposal\". On April 6th, he a nd the Marines were at the outskirts of Baghd ad, facing a strategic bridge the Americans called \"the Baghd ad Highway Bridge\". Residential areas were now much g reater in nu mber, but American snipers were ordered to k ill anything coming in their direction. That night a teenager who was crossing the bridge was killed. Van d er Stockt described to Le Monde what followed: \"On the morning of April 7, the Marines decided to cross the b ridge. A shell fell onto an armored p ersonnel carrier. Two marines were killed. The crossing took on a tragic aspect. The soldiers were stressed, febrile. They were shouting. The risk didn't appear to be that great, so I followed their ad vance. They were howling, shou ting o rders and positions to ea ch o ther. It sounded like something in-between a p hantasm, mythology and conditioning. The o peration was transformed into crossing the bridge over the River Kwai. \"Later, there was s ome op en terrain. The Marines were a dvancing and taking up po sition, hiding beh ind mounds of earth. They were still really tense. A small blue van was moving towards the convoy. Three not- very-accurate warning shots were fired. The shots were supposed to make the van stop. The van kept on driving, made a U-turn. took s helter and then returned slowly. The Marines opened fire. All hell broke loose. They were firing a ll over the p lace. You could hear 'Stop firing' being shou ted. The silence that set in was overwhelming. Two men a nd a woman had just been riddled with bullets. So this was the en emy, the threat. \"A second vehicle d rove up . The same scenario was repeated. Its passengers were killed on the spot. A grandfather was walking slowly with a cane on the sidewalk. They k illed h im too. As with the o ld man, the Marines fired on a SUV driving a long the river bank that was getting too close to them. Riddled with bullets, the vehicle rolled over. Two women and a child got out, miraculously s till alive. They s ought refuge in the wreckage. A few seconds later, it flew into b its as a tank lobb ed a terse shot into it.

The latest little gem is the Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb o r Moab, the 'Mother of all Bombs'. The use of the name, Moab, would n ever be a coincidence to the symbolism-obsessed Illuminati. Moab is a name familiar to readers of the Old Testament as in the Plains of Moab, near Jericho (Numbers 22:1, 26 :63, Joshua 13:32), where the Israelites are c laimed to h ave made their last encampment before they entered the Promised Land after their alleged journey through the wilderness. The Bible says that the c haracter called Moses died in Moab. The location also h as associations with Freemasonry. The bomb o f the same name is the most powerful non -nuclear weapon on the planet. The Moab d etonates 21,000lb o f explosives abov e the ground and is guided by the satellite linked global positioning system. It can trigger temperatures of up to 538 C (I,OOO F) and h as an awesome destructive power. I wond er if this just might qualify as a 'weapon o f mass destruction? Imagine that dropping on a c ivilian area or anywhere. Wade Frazier's excellent study o f the Gulf 'War' reveals the background to another weapon u sed against the Iraqi people: \"The [fuel-air] bomb works thus: there are two de tonations; the first spreads a fine mist of fuel into the a ir, turning the area [about the size o f a football field] into an e xplosive mix of vast proportion; then a second detonation ignites the mixture, causing an awesome e xplosion. The e xplosion is abou t the most powerful 'conventiona l' explosion we know of.’’ \"At a p ressure shock of up to 2 00 p ounds per square inch (PSI), people in its detona tion zone are often killed b y the sheer compression of the a ir around them. Human be ings c an typically withstand up to about a 40-PSI shock. The bo mb sucks oxygen ou t of the a ir, and can apparently even suck the lung s out through the mouths of people u nfortunate e nough to be in the de tonation zone . Our military used it on he lpless people [in the 1991 Gulf Slaughter].\" 48 "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 101 Figu re 1.6: Wou ld a hung ry c hild spo t the d ifference? The 'food ' pa rcels and cluster bomblets were both d ropped by US forces and both were the same colou r yellow. How sick can you get? Figu re 1.7: Wha t cluster bombs do : this is only one o f ten s of thou sand s of victims mutilated by US cluster bombs in Sou th East Asia. The US and UK dropped the se same weap ons on civilians in Afgh anistan a nd Iraq. Still sup port the troop s, These weapon s were used in Afghanistan and the two wars on Iraq. Oft one e nd o f this process is a 'hero' in a uniform pressing a button and on the other are men, women and children exploding into piece s. The Iraqi pop ulation were subjected to a lovely piece of hardware called a 'Big Blue', which p roduces a shock wave only eclipsed by nuclear weapon s. Wade Frazier points out that the power of the shock wave can turn a body into a hamburger. Also d eployed were the 'boun cing bombs' that are designed to 'bounce' to waist height before e xploding and ensure a better chance of hitting p eople. There is the 'Beehive' bomb that explodes 8,800 piece s of razor-edged shrapnel in all directions, tearing p eople a part. The US and British heroes and liberators bombarded Iraq, as they d id Afghanistan, with lethal cluster bombs that cause horrendou s civilian d eath and suffering. Cluster bombs can b e delivered by aircraft, artillery o r missile. Each on e releases dozens, often hund reds of smaller 'bomb lets' or 'grenades'. In turn, eac h o f these contains hund reds of metal fragments. Just one of these fragments can rupture the spleen o r cause the intestines to explode. 49 These weapon s are particularly indiscriminate a nd if you are there when they fall, that's just too bad. So many o f these bomb lets fail to explode initially that their use peppers the landscape with land m ines waiting to go o ff when any un knowing child touches them. In Afghanistan the sick minds at the Pentagon dropp ed \"food p arcels\" that were almost identical in colour and d esign as the c luster bomblets (Figure 16). In Laos, where there are still an estimated 10 million (or more) unexploded American cluster bombs, people are still being killed almost every d ay from these weapon s dropp ed 30 y ears ago (Figure 17).50 During the 1991 Gulf War more than 30 milli on cluster bomblets were dropp ed on Kuwait and Iraq. Unexploded bombs later killed 1,600 civilians and injured another 2,500 . A study by the Red Cross revealed that children in Kosovo are five times more likely to b e killed o r injured by a NA TO-dropp ed un exploded cluster bomb than by a Serbian landmine. Today in Afghanistan the killi ng also still continues, as it does in Iraq. Reports in Augu st 2003 sugg ested that a thou sand Iraqi children h ad already died this way. More than 50 international organizations, including the International Comm ittee of the Red Cross, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the International Committee to Ban Landmines have ca lled for a moratorium on cluster bomb u se, but the US and Britain go on u sing them. 51 When y ou think that all these weapon s and more were deployed against Iraq, is it any wond er that people suffered such g rotesque injuries from this s cale of savagery?

Reporting from villages around the c ity on ce kno wn as Babylon (how appropriate), he said that the wards of the Hillah teac hing hospital contained the proof that \"something illegal- something q uite outside the Geneva Conv entions\" had o ccurred: the use of cluster bombs. He described the wailing children, the you ng women with b reast and leg wound s, the ten p atients upon whom doctors had to p erform brain surgery to remove metal from their heads. They talked o f the days and n ights when the e xplosives fell \"like grapes\" from the sky. Were they American o r British aircraft that showered these villages with on e of the most lethal weapon s of modern warfare? Fisk wanted to kno w. The 61 d ead who h ad p assed through the Hillah ho spital could no t say, he wrote, and no r could the survivors who, in many cases, were \"sitting in their homes when the white ca nisters opened h igh abov e their village, spilli ng thousands of bomb lets into the sky, exploding in the a ir, soaring through windows and d oorways to bu rst indoors or bouncing o ff the roofs of the c oncrete huts to b low up later in the roadways ... Some died at once, mostly women and children, some of whose blackened, decomposing remains lay in the tiny charnel house mortuary at the back o f the Hillah ho spital.\" 52 The hospital treated 200 wound ed, besides the 61 d ead, and many o thers were believed to h ave died who were not brough t to the hospital. Doctors s aid abou t 80 p er cent of the victims were c ivilians. Robert Fisk wrote: \"Heartbreaking is the on ly word to de scribe 1 0-year-old Maryam Nasr and h er five-year old sister Hoda. Maryam has a pa tch over her right eye, where a p iece of bomblet embedded itself, and wound s to the stomach and thighs. I didn't realize that Hoda, stand ing b y her sister's bed, was wounded un til her mother carefully lifted the little g irl's sc arf and long ha ir to show a deep p uncture in the right side o f her head, just above her ear, congea led b lood sticking to he r hair but the wound still gen tly bleeding. \"Their mother described h ow she had been inside her home and heard an e xplosion a nd found h er daughters in a p ool of blood n ear the door. The little g irls alternately s miled and h id when I took their pictures. In o ther wards, the h ideou sly wounded would try to laugh, t o show their bravery. It was a hu mbling experience.\" 53 Fisk d escribed the mortuary as \"a butcher's s hop o f chopp ed-up corpses\" and there was a graphic acc oun t of the c luster-bomb carnage in the Asian Times. 54 It quo ted Roland Hugu enin-Benjamin, a spok esman for the International Comm ittee of the Red Cross (ICR C) in Iraq, describing the scene in Hillah as \"a horror, dozens of severed bod ies and scattered limbs\". Journalists found \"babies cut in h alf, amputated limbs, kids with their faces a web o f deep cuts caused by American shellfire a nd cluster bombs\". Nobo dy in the West saw these images on their television screens because they were c ensored and milder versions distributed. The Asia Times report said that an Arab cameramen told how he saw two trucks full of bodies - mostly children, and women in flowered d resses - parked ou tside the Hillah ho spital. If you miss the first time - get 'em later The mass bombing made e normous additions to the depleted u ranium left by the c onflict of 1991 that has sent the rates of leukaemia, other cancers, and d eformed b abies s oaring. The British Ministry o f Defence confirmed that troops returning from the Gulf were offered tests to assess the levels of depleted u ranium in their bod ies and establish if they were in d anger of suffering kidney d amage a nd lung cancer. 55 Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman o f the Royal Society working g roup on d epleted u ranium, said: \"It is high ly unsatisfactory to d eploy a large a moun t of a material that is weakly radioactive a nd chemically toxic without knowing ho w much soldiers and civilians have been expo sed to it.\" 56 He said civilians in Iraq should b e protected by checking milk and water samples for depleted u ranium over a prolong ed p eriod and that soldiers might suffer kidney d amage a nd increased risk o f lung cancer if they b reathed in substantial amoun ts. But, of course, we kno w the e ffect of this poison with the c onsequences for the Iraqi people since 1991 . Within three years of the conflict cancer in Iraq h ad increased 700 % and thou sands f troop s are suffering from Gulf War Synd rome, which the a uthorities s pent so long trying to dismiss. Despite the c lear correlation b etween h ealth effects and d epleted u ranium, the UK 'Defence' Secretary Geoff Hoon told the House of Comm ons in 2003 that there was \"not the slightest scientific e vidence\" to sugg est that depleted uranium left a poisonous residue. 57 This is breathtaking, inhumane, mendacious claptrap, as Hoon must kno w. He, like Tony Blair, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Home Secretary David Blunk ett, are, in my view, beyond words. They are an insult to the principles on which their Labou r Party was created and h as long-since discarded to serve the Illuminati agenda. Professor Doug Rokk e is a former US army colonel and director of the Pentagon 's depleted u ranium project. He says that the military canno t just contaminate a ny other nation, cause harm its· people a nd environment and then igno re the c onsequences of what they h ave"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 103 don e. He ca lled on the US and UK to \"recogn ise the immoral consequences of their actions and assume respon sibilit y for medical care a nd thorough environmental remediation \".58 But they won't because they don 't care a bou t the c onsequences for troop s or civilians, only that the outcome suits their plans. The UN Environment Programm e found that the depleted u ranium used by the US and UK in the Balkans had reac hed the water table a nd seven y ears after the conflict it recomm ended the decontamination o f buildings to p rotect the c ivilian po pu lation against cancer. But there's no evidence is there, Mr Goon ? Depleted u ranium is s tandard in a number of anti-tank weapon s and is also contained in bullets, shells and b ombs. The so-called bunk er busters used in Baghd ad contain seven tonn es of depleted uranium alone a nd on e of these was used in the \"attempt to kill Saddam Hussein\" when a restaurant was targeted. This alone would h ave c ontaminated a large c ivilian area with d epleted u ranium and that is just one bomb. 59 Experts s ugg est that between 1 ,000 and 2,000 tonnes of depleted u ranium were used by the coalition in the three week conflict compared with 340 tonnes in 1 991- and look at the c onsequences of tha t. 60 Saul Bloom is executive director of Arc Ecology, a San Francisco-based non profit organisation that has helped foreign governments analyse the e nvironmental impacts of US military b ases. He says of the uranium pollution : \"Post-war environmental deaths may exceed d irect civilian casualties.\" 61 Thus we can observe both the c onsequences for the Iraqi people of being 'liberated' and the a lmost unimaginable sickness of the soul it takes to p lan such suffering simply to increase you r own po wer. Yet these are the minds that control our world. For how much long er are we going to let them?? Medal if you kill, jail of you d on't Events may appear to b e topsy-turvy and Alice in Wond erland, but that's only if you are look ing for log ical explanations based on the world the people a re c ond itioned to b elieve in. The c omm on theme that finds the log ical in the a pparently inexplicable is a simple question: is it good for the a genda? For example, it does not appear logical or consistent to arm Saddam Hussein with chemical and biological weapon s and then for the same people to u se his alleged po ssession o f such weapon s to invade his coun try. But it suited the agenda both to arm Iraq b efore the Gulf War in 1991 and then to invade in 2003 u sing the US-supp lied 'weapon s of mass destruction' as the e xcuse. To the manipulators there is nothing contradictory in that at all. It is s imply the way the game is played. If you kill people while wearing a uniform they give you a medal and if you do the same in jeans and a T-shirt they give you a life sentence. Soldiers are ca lled \"heroes\" for killi ng civilians and jailed if they refuse to do so. This, again, is perfectly logical beca use the Illuminati want their troop s to kill people. They don 't want their fodd er in un iform using their own minds and conscience a nd refusing to b e involved in murder. Two British soldiers faced up to two y ears in p rison for refusing to fight in Iraq b ecause they would not take part in a c onflict in which civilians would b e killed. The two men, thou ght to b e a private a nd an air technician with the 16 Air Assault Brigade, were sent back to their barracks and a third was preparing for a court martial after he would no t travel to Iraq. Stephen Eagle Funk, a 20-year-old US marine reserve, also refused to be sent to Iraq to take part in a war he believed was \"immoral beca use of the deception invo lved by our leaders\".62 He said h e would rather take the punishment now than live with what he would h ave to do in Iraq for the rest of his life: \"I would b e going in kno wing that it was wrong and that would b e hypo critical.\" 63 He faced a possible c ourt martial and time in a milit ary p rison for his action. But he is a true military h ero. As Mark Twain said: \"It is curious that phy sical courage shou ld b e so comm on in the world and moral courage so rare.\" Like increasing numbers of you ng soldiers, Funk o nly joined the milit ary to h ave his college fees paid and b ecause \"the a ds make the armed forces look so cool- 'call this number and we'll send you a free pair of box er shorts'. A lot of kids had no idea what was involved\", he said.64 He was s oon to find out: \"Every d ay in combat training you h ad to y ell out 'Kill! Kill!' and we would g et into troub le if you didn't shout it out, so o ften I would just mouth it so I didn't get into troub le.\"65 He said that recruits were e ncouraged to hu rt each o ther in h and-to- hand combat training. \"I couldn't do that so they would p air me up with someone who was very v iolent or aggressive.\"66 When the instructor told him he had an attitude problem he c ould not keep q uiet any longer: \"I was a little p issed off and I said, 'I think k illing pe ople is wrong.' That was the crystallising moment because I had ne ver said it out loud before. It was s uch a relief. It's a lot easier if you just give in and don't question authority.\" 67 He said h e had spok en ou t to warn o ther young p eople a bou t the manipulations of the military: \"War is abou t destruction a nd violence and death. It is y oung men fighting o ld men's wars. It is not the answer; it just ravages the land of the battleground. I know it's wrong bu t other people in the military have been p rogrammed to think it is OK. All they [the military] want is numbers. What I'm doing is really trying to edu cate pe ople to weigh their options - there are so many more ways to ge t money for schoo l.\" 68 Albert Einstein put it so well: \"The pioneers of a warless world are the you th who refuse military service.\" "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 104 Pawns in uniform, oops, sorry, \"our troops\" The irony is that the troop s who bo mbard these c oun tries with their lethal weapon ry causing such d eath and destruction are thernse1v ~ s considered to b e e xpendable fodd er by the Illuminati. The war criminal, Henry Kissinger, a major Illuminati front man for more than 40 y ears, said: \"Military men are dumb, stupid animals to b e used as pawns for foreign p olicy.\"69 They are portrayed as heroes when they go to war and they are hailed as even g reater heroes if they d ie for the Illuminati, or \"the ca use of freedom and liberation \". But once they are dead, or if they are maimed for life or develop war-related d isease like Gulf War Synd rome, they will be ignored and cast aside, even pub licly condemned. My father served with the Army Medical Corps in the Second World War and h e told me from an early age a bou t the reality o f war. He told me how young kids, still in their teens, would b e brought back from battle with ho rrendous injuries screaming for their mothers thou sands of miles away. He recalled ho w they would add b allast inside the coffins to cover the fact that there was s o little left of the person inside. He a lso told me how military doctors would b end the rules to g et people e nlisted into the military at wartime when they h ad medical problems that should h ave prevented this. Then, when they returned injured in mind o r body, the same doctors would follow the rules to the letter to stop legitimate c ompensation. I wrote a poem abou t this that you will find in App endix II. Typical of this attitude was the e xperience of Lianne Seymour, a mother of a young child, whose husband, Ian, died in a helicopter crash in Iraq. Soon after his death she received a letter from the British Ministry o f 'Defence' saying that she would h ave to v aca te her military ho me a nd repay n ine days of his s alary that had been p aid since his death. When the story b roke in the newspapers the Blair gang d id what they always do when the truth is out. They lied and blamed it all on the man at the ministry who sent the letter. They described it as a \"mistake\" and said it was not policy to do this. It turns out that this is e xactly what the policy is. I don 't kno w w hy she shou ld b e made to suffer further, but Lianne Seymour was invited to meet Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon , as he sough t to o ffset the bad pub licity. He said she would no t have to repay the nine days pay o r move out of the hou se. She said o f the meeting: \"It's completely disappointing. I think his words were that I'm not going to live in luxu ry bu t at least I'm not going to b e poo r, which I just think is terrible.\" 70 The men who sent her husband to war while never seeing a bullet fired themselves, will of course, continue to live in luxury. Some 200,000 soldiers who took p art in the Gulf War of 1991 complained o f pain, sickness, skin p roblems, loss of memory and concentration - the symptoms of Gulf War Synd rome. The a verage payment in compensation for the loss of their long -term health is, acc ording to campaigner Joyce Riley, abou t $98 a month. 7 ! Some 60,000 h ave had compensation claims rejected by the Pentagon . Riley said the pathetic payment \"basically washes the DOD 's hands; they can say 'look , we a re compensating\"'.72 Major General Smedley Butler was twice awarded the Medal of Hono r, while serving for more than 30 y ears in the United States Marine Corps. He e ncapsulated the real nature of war and the milit ary in a speech in July 19 33 in which h e said that war is just a racket condu cted by the very few at the expense of masses and that only a small group on the inside knows what it is really a11 about. He went on: \"Like a ll the members of the military profession, I ne ver had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the o rders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military s ervice. I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American o il interests in 19 14. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American, repub lics for the benefits of Wall Street. I helped pu rify Nicaragua for the international banking h ouse of Brown Brothers in 19 09 1912 . I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 19 16. In China I helped to see to it that Stand ard Oil went its way unmolested.\" 73 Nothing changes. The Project for the New A merican Century do cument says that the US must \"fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars\" as a \"core mission \". Put another way, large numbers of US troop s are going to b e killed and ho rrifically injured to g ive these c rackpo ts their global control. Donald Rumsfeld told the troops involved in the Iraq slaugh ter: \"With the liberation o f Ir aq, you have transformed the c oun try, but how you did it will transform how w e defend ou r coun try in the 21st century.\" Yep, he really said, \"defend\". What he means is the policy o f \"first strike defence\" (attack) will be used to invade the neo-Nazi shopp ing list of target coun tries and a lot of troop s are going to die a nd b e maimed for life. All the troops cheered when h e said that and treated Rumsfeld like some sort of god . It's the same whenever President Village Idiot reads his s pinner-prepared speeches to the pawns in u niform. They cheer the 'leaders' who see the troop s as nothing more than cattle to b e used as necessary. It is s o pathetic to watch. When Bush talked to troop s abou t their colleagues who d ied in Iraq, he said: \"No o ne who fall s will be forgotten b y this grateful nation. We ho nor their service to America and we pray their families will receive God's c omfort and God's grace.\" "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 105 Those words were delivered by a practicing Satanist who kno ws that the troop s are only there to b e used and abused as required by the a genda he serves. It's just another script for the movie. The true scale of milit ary casualties and the nature of their injuries are supp ressed for the same reason as civilian casualties are not emphasised. It's bad for the movie version o f war and the reasons behind it. An American neurosurgeon, Gene Bolles, told his local newspaper in Boulder, Colorado, how the daily \"White House press briefings and fuzzy real-time TV reports fall far short of conv eying the brutality o f war\".74 Bolles treated military casualties at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where he has been chief of neurosurgery for 16 y ears. He said: \"It really is disgustingly s anitized on television ... we h ave h ad a number of really horrific injuries now from the war. They have lost arms, legs, hand s; they have been b urned; they have had significant brain injuries and peripheral nerve damage. These a re young kids that are going to be , in some regards, changed for life. I don't feel that peop le reali ze that ... t hese a re young children; 18, 19, 20 with a rms and legs blown off. That is the reality.\" 75 A message to \"our troops\" British Prime Minister Tony Blair had such contempt for the families of two d ead soldiers that he said at a news conference with George Bush that they h ad b een executed by the Iraqis. This was based, as usual with Blair, on no evidence whatsoever, but it suited the moment to indicate that this had h appened. The families were devastated b ecause the military h ad told them the men h ad b een k illed in action and Blair was forced to make a pub lic a pology for the grief his s pinning h ad caused. \"Suppo rt our troop s\", they tell us while they \"exploit our troops\", even after they are dead. For goodn ess s ake, get out of the forces before you are the next victim of these insane c riminals. You are not liberating anyone; you are helping to complete the global fascist state that you and you r children will have to live in. Many former soldiers in the US and British armies have c ontacted me over the years to say they no w realise how they h ave been u sed and there a re multimilli ons in the military today who h ave no earthly clue why they are killing p eople. One teenage American soldier in Iraq called \"Private AJ\" told a CNN reporter: \"I wanna get in there a nd g et my no se dirty, I wanna take revenge for 9/11.\" The reporter pointed ou t there was no evidence to link the Iraqi gov ernment with September 11th Private AJ pushed h is tongu e out to the e nd o f his chin and replied: \"Yeah, well that stuff's way over my h ead.\"76 According to a New York Times/CBS News survey, 42 p er cent of the American pub lic a lso b elieved that Sad d am Hussein was directly respon sible for the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre a nd the Pentagon . An AB C News poll said that 55 p er cent of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein directly supports al-Qaeda.77 The graphic descriptions in this chapter don 't even b egin to po rtray the true magnitude of the horror those people suffered and, for the ones who survived, continue to suffer. If people don 't und erstand what ~ war' really means behind the flag waving and victory p arades they will go on supporting the sick minds that are plann ing to repeat the e xperience in coun try after coun try across the world. This is no time for mincing words and p laying softly, softly. We need to look this in the face and d eal with it. Those in u niform, \"our troop s\", who kill people to o rder- \"three Iraqi's to go , please, heavy on the a mm o\" - are not \"heroes\". They are paid assassins guilty o f mass murder. And it's time someone said it.

Lenin A lie ca n travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its s hoes. Mark Twain Instead o f telling the truth abou t the c onsequences of war, the Pentagon spinners produ ce a story straight from a Hollywood mov ie a nd it's important to know their techniques beca use they are due to b e repeated many times ip their race for global control. The star of one of their Iraqi productions was 19-year-old Private Jessica Lynch, from Palestine, West Virginia, who joined the military to h ave her college fees paid b eca use she wanted to b e a kindergarten teacher. The c ollege fee sting was highlighted in an excellent BBC documentary I saw. The milit ary are now so . desperate to recruit more troop s to \"fight and d ecisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars as a c ore mission \" that they are targeting and militarising schools, especially those of the poo r and minorities, and enticing them into the military with the promise of paying their college fees. Once they sign on the line, however, these kids become liable to b e deployed in war zones. So it was with Jessica Lynch. Jessica found h erself in Iraq working as a supp ly clerk with the Army's 507 th Maintenance Company. She was captured when her unit made a wrong turn n ear Nasiriya a nd was ambushed . Oh, what a frenzy o f Hollywood scriptwriting exploded from the Pentagon for the media to feed upon . Mitchell Catlin, an Australian correspond ent, even called h er \"Private Ryan\", the Demi Moore c haracter, in on e report. The mistake was und erstandable beca use that was the way she was portrayed. \"Belying h er coun try-girl smile a nd p etite 5-foot-5 frame, Lynch pu t up a Rambo-worthy fight when h er unit, the Army's 507 th Ordnance Maintenance Co., came und er attack, according to a new report\", screamed on e paper. Lynch op ened fire on the Iraqi assailants, picking them off one by on e until she ran ou t of amm unition, reported the Washington Post. Wow. She had continued shoo ting - even after she was shot and stabbed and h er unit members were killed all around h er. \"She was fighting to the death\", a US official told the Post. \"She did not want to b e taken alive.\" ~ Er, so ho w come that after doing this to h er \"assailants\", those nasty Iraqis didn't kill her when she ran ou t of amm unition? And ho w come she had no bu llet or stab wound s?? Do you think US troop s would h ave spared h er in the same circumstances? The reports said that Lynch h ad b een shot, stabbed and tortured and the pub lic. were told what a great American little Jessie was. All this happened at a time when the a uthorities were being criticised for the way the war was going. However, the Iraqi doctors who treated h er told a very d ifferent story abou t the \"gun slinging, shot and stabbed\" heroine. They said that she suffered fractures to her arms and lower limbs and a \"small skull woun d\", sustained when h er vehicle overturned. Her American do ctors s aid she had fractures in h er upp er right arm, upp er left leg, lower left leg and right ankle a nd foot. Her father, Greg Lynch Sr., told reporters s he had no penetration wounds. \"It was a road traffic accident\", said Haitham Gizzy, a phy sician at the hospital at Nasiriya who treated Lynch for her injuries. \"There was not a drop o f blood ... there were no bu llets or shrapnel or anything like . ~ at.\" Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary o f Defense, said: \"I'm not go ing to g et into the specific injuries that she sustained; that's up to h er and h er doctors to d iscuss at the appropriate time.\"3 Like never. Discussing h er injuries was not a problem, however, when they were telling u s s he was stabbed and shot. At the hospital, Dr Haitham Gizzy said, \"She was given special care, more than the Iraqi patients.\" 4 Harith al- Houssona, another d9ctor who treated Lynch, said: \"She was very frightened when she woke up and she kept saying: 'Please don 't hurt me, don 't touch me.' I told h er that she was safe, she was in a hospital and that I was a doctor, and I never hurt a patient.\"5 He said h e went outside the hospital during the bombing to g et supplies of her favou rite drink, orange juice, and struggled to p ersuade her to eat. The doctor said that Iraqi intelligence officers told the hospital that Private Lynch would soon b e transferred to Baghd ad, but instead h e told an ambulance driver to d eliver her to on e of the American ou tposts that had already b een established on the outskirts of the c ity. \"But when h e reached their checkpo int, the Americans fired at him\", he said. 6 You mean the Pentagon told u s a pack o f lies? Never. But Hollywood wasn't finished y et. The day after the Iraqi ambulance drive ~ had tried to d eliver Private Lynch to US troop s only to b e fired up on, she was ~ \"resct1ed\" from her Ir aqi hospital bed, we were told, in a daring raid by a team of Navy Seals, Marine comm ando s, Air Force pilots and Army Rangers working with US S pecial Forces. It was the first time a n American Prisoner of War was freed from behind enemy lines in h alf a ce ntury, the media trumpeted. But once again the Iraqi doctors who were there tell a rather different tale. \"They made a big show\", said Lynch's doctor, Haitham Gizzy. \"It was just a drama, a big, dramatic show.\"? Gizzy and o ther doctors s aid that there were no Iraqi soldiers or militiamen at the hospital when the US S pecial Operations forces arrived in their helicopters. Most of Saddam's Fedayeen Fighters and the e ntire Ba'ath Party leadership h ad fled. There was no on e a t the hospital when the troop s arrived, he said, on ly d octors. Dr Hassan and o thers on du ty that evening said they heard a \"big thumping\" near the hospital and the sound o f helicopters and tanks before the soldiers began to enter the hospital. He said the doctors agreed to stay in on e room and no t to intervene while the soldiers broke down several doo rs in the hospital before locating Lynch. US soldiers videotaped the rescue, but among the many scenes not shown to the press at US Central Comm and in Doha, Qatar, was one of four doctors who were handcuffed and interrogated, together with two civilian p atients, one of whom was imm ob ile a nd conn ected to a drip. \"They were doctors, with stethoscopes round their necks\", Dr Harith said, \"Even in war, a doctor shou ld not be treated like that’s Hardly the story the Pentagon wanted to p edal. \"What the Americans say is like the story o f Sinbad the Sailor - it's a myth\", said Dr Harith al-Houssona. \"They said that there was no medical care in Iraq and that there was a very strong d efence of this hospital, but there was no on e here a part from doctors and p atients, and there was nobody to fire a t them.\"9 The doctor said that the troop s cut open a bed specially"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 109 designed for patients with b ed sores that Private Lynch h ad b een u sing. \"They took samples of sand ou t of it\", Dr Harith said. \"It was the only b ed like it that w e h ave, the only one in the governorate.\" He said h e felt sad that he would n ever see Jessica a gain, but he felt happy that she was happy and h ad gon e back to h er life. \"If I could speak to h er I would say: 'Cong ratulations!'\" he said. Terrible people these Iraqis aren't they? Diplomatic amnesia Unfortunately, acc ording to the US gov ernment's broadcasting arm, Fox/Fix News and o thers, Jessica Lynch could no t remember what happened to h er either when she was captured o r during h er time a t the hospital. 11 A US official said: \"She basically h as amnesia, and h as mentally blocked ou t the horrible things we strong ly believe she went through .\"12 Mmmm . Fox News reported that military p sychiatrists had b een talking to h er. I bet they h ave. It must have been a strangely d elayed amnesia beca use there was apparently no sign o f it until she was in the hands of her fellow A mericans at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. According to h er doctor, Isadore Rosenfeld, she began to suffer fr om a c ond ition called Total Global Amnesia.13 Later they said that she was not suffering from amnesia, she just couldn't remember! I t was unlikely, they said, that she e ver would. 14 It is s uch a pi t y especially u nless her memory returns s he will be unable to confirm that what actually h appened to h er and what the Pentagon spinners told u s had h appened, were so d ifferent it would b e a kin to comparing the mind o f Einstein with that of President Village Idiot. Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary o f Defense, said h e knew there was some \"conflicting information ou t there, but in du e time the full story will be told, I'm sure. But not by you , mate. The military awarded Lynch the Bronze Star for meritorious combat service, a Prisoner of War medal and the Purple Heart, which is usually awarded to those wound ed in combat. What's the medal they award for keeping you r mouth shut? While Jessica Lynch and h er rescuers were being h ailed across the front pages, what of her fellow patients in that Iraqi hospital? Among them, the doctors s aid, were many civilians, includ ing children, being treated in crowded wards for severed limbs and d eep lace rations caused by US tank fire a nd bo mbs during the opening week o f the 'war'. The doctors estimated that some 300 civilians were killed in Nasiriya a nd 1 ,000 wounded. Not counting the losses The war propaganda was not only involved in suppressing the e xtent of the death and injury suffered by civilians. It also worked to k eep secret the number of soldiers who d ied. This is always the case because the lower the perceived casualties, civilian and military, the more support there will be for the next war. Dr Waiel S.H. Aw wad, a Syrian war correspond ent with Al Arabiya television, a part of Middle East Broadcasting Corporation, went missing in Iraq for nine days before making contact with h is family. He told Asian News International how he was an \"embedded\" reporter with a US maintenance division when they were ambushed 20 kilometres north o f Basra on their way to the town o f Zuber. He said that he a nd h is film crew w ere taken to the local headqu arters of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party b efore a compassionate tribal leader arranged for their escape. While was there, he said, he saw 20 British troops killed in Zuber, but the a uthorities only announced two: “... I saw it with my own e yes, three tanks were b lown [up], t hree vehicles were b lown [up] and six prisoners of war were caught. Now who could g ive such facts from the ground if we were not there.\" 16 He a lso described ho w the fierce fighting the 'coalition' forces faced in the early stages was und erplayed by the western media. The lies told by the American milit ary and p eople like Rumsfeld with regard to the unfolding milit ary campaign were e ven h ighlighted by some mainstream organisations like the BBC , so b latant did they become. How many troop s have been k illed and injured in Iraq? We ce rtainly can't trust the a uthorities to tell us, but what happened in Afghanistan might give us an idea. Mohamm ed Daud Miraki, the a uthor of Perpetual Death From Ameiica,t7 claims that American losses in Afghanistan alone a re far higher than admitted. In March 2003 , he e stimated the number of dead US soldiers in Afghanistan at 1,200 and they are still being killed, a ~ ,are Afghan civilians in far greater numbers as that conflict continues out of the headlines. Miraki says the US does not reveal the military losses in Afghanistan b eca use they want to appear invincible a s a military force. The US wanted to envisage their military might, he' says, as a force that even the great guerrilla fighters from Afghanistan could not muster the skills needed to h inder their impecca ble military machine. But in fact, he c laims, the US military h ad lost many soldiers by March 2003 : \"According to various intelligence agen cies, the US has lost over 1,200 soldiers in Afghanistan. The Russian intelligence a gency put the figure of dead in the first six months of the war at 373 dead a nd 5 85 critically injured. Meanwhile, reports from other intelligence agen cies including Iranian and Indian a mong o thers put the number of dead US soldiers to be over 600 in the first year, and after 18 months, they report the figure of US losses over 1,200 a nd 1 ,500 critically wounded.\" 18 At the start of the war, he wrote, \"the c orpses of US soldiers were transported to Jacobabad and Dalbudin Air Bases in Pakistan and the c oun try's Frontier Post newspaper reported ho w 45 US troop s were killed on just one day du ring a land operation n ear Kandahar. It further reported that 26 d ead comm ando s have been d elivered to the US-leased military b ase near the Pakistani town o f Jacobabad.\"19 The IRNA news agency reported on December 2nd 2001 that 124 d ead US soldiers were transported from Pakistan to the US: \"The b odies of 124 American troops have been flown back home in a cargo p lane on November 29 [2001], claimed a local daily here on Sunday ... The Pakistan Observer reported that the troops were killed during clashes with Taliban fighters when they had landed in Helmand province to help the e x-governor of Kandahar Gul Agha's Lashkar fighters aga inst Taliban.\" 20 Miraki said h e was personally aware of the US losses in Helmand in which four Apache Helicopters were also shot down. Andrei Sukhozhilov, a reporter conn ected with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), wrote how he had ob tained information abou t casualties from Khanabad Air Base in southern Uzbekistan."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 110 \"Uzbek sources at Khanabad sugg est that the teal figures of US casualties are far higher than the Pentagon 's official totals,\"21 h e said, and h e went on: \"Uzbek army personnel working a t the a ir base said scores of US casualties have been a rriving there. From November 25 to December 2 [2001 ], an Uzbek orderly working with American medical staff said he h ad witnessed the a rrival of four to five US helicopters carrying between them 10-15 American casualties - each day ... \" ... An Uzbek pilot spoke o f the d eath last week of an American soldier who he had become friend ly with while he was on the ba se. The US serviceman, he said, had d ied in the a ttempt to end the prison riot on the outskirts of Mazar-e-Sharif two weeks ago . 'A lot of American troops died there - it was a real battle', the p ilot said.\" 22 For sure you will find the same story in Iraq and all wars orchestrated by these re-writers of reality. Embedded to deceive Illuminati control of the mainstream m edia e nsured that pretty much the only story the public rece ived was the official version from the Bush cartel. A study by the Washington-based Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting revealed that 76 p er cent of the guests on n etwork talk shows in late January and early February 2003 were current or former gov ernment officials while those speaking against the war accoun ted for less than on e per cent.23 This is how the game works across the world. You emphasise the 'information' that suppo rts you r view and supp ress that which challenges it. When you complain that only on e side of the debate is being given, the media say: \"No, no, we had a guy on speaking against the war a week last Thursday.\" Very important to the required slant are the news agencies that supp ly 'news' to all media outlets throughout the world. These a re owned, of course, by the Illuminati. For instance the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, friend o f the Bushes and owner of the Washington Times, bough t the newswire UPIY The conn ections are e ndless. The British media canno t, with some e xceptions, be c onfused with real journalism, but it is s till light years ahead o f the American version. The bias on n etworks like CNN and Murdoch's Fox News are simply sickening. Robert Fisk, the outstanding journalist on the UK Independe1lt, described American journalism as increasingly \"vapid, hop eless, gutless, unchallenging\" since 9 /1J.2-' Having spent a great deal of time in the United States s ince the mid1990 s, the only p oint I would qu estion is the bit about \"since 9/11\", although it did certainly worsen after that. It was the Pentagon 's idea to h ave 'embedded reporters', in o ther w ~ {is journalists assigned to milit ary u nits during the war. Does anyon e believe that this was don e because the Pentagon wanted the truth to b e told? Can elephants fly? They said the policy h ad \"worked well\" or, more acc urately, worked well in managing the news. Many times I heard reporters talking abou t \"we\" did this or \"we a re doing this\" when what they meant was the milit ary with whom they were 'embedded'. The British ITN correspond ent, Bill Neely, wearing full milit ary combat gear and standing in a transport aircraft, told viewers: \"We have just this s econd crossed the border into Iraq. We'll be land ing at our target in abou t ten minutes time.\" Our target? The idea is that you k eep the journalists where you want them, feed them the story you want them to tell, and you g et them so close to the troop s on whom they d epend to survive that they lose objectivity, That is largely what happened. NBC News correspond ent David Bloom, who died o f a blood clot in his lung, told his audience: \"[The soldiers] have don e anything and everything that we c ould ask o f them, and we in turn are trying to return the favor by do ing anything and everything that they can ask o f llS.\"26 The British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon , said the imagery the e mbedded journalists broadcast was at least partially respon sible for the public's change of mood in suppo rting the war. 27 Almost 100 camera crews were 'embedded' with US units and when they n eeded even more positive images the milit ary shot the pictures themselves and released them to the networks. They showed them like the lap dog s they are. Robert Jensen, a journalism professor at ~ he University o f Texas, pointed ou t that 'embedding' meant following the rules dictated by the military: \"Those rules s aid repo rters could no t travel ind epend ently (which meant they cou ld no t rea lly repo rt ind epend ently), interviews had to b e on the record (which meant lower-level service members were less likely to say any thing critical), and officers cou ld censor copy and tempo rarily restrict electron ic transmission s for 'op eration al security' (which, in p ractice, cou ld b e defined as whatever field command ers want to censor.\" 27 CentCon An excellent BBC documentary in the Correspondent series highlighted the manipulation o f journalists by the political and military spinners.28 It revealed ho w journalists assembling with British forces in Kuwait were. ordered no t to report what they saw. Tom Copetas of Bloomberg Television said: \"We were not allowed to take an y pictures or describe British soldiers c arrying guns. I was told that there was a decision made b y Downing Street that the military minders of the journalists down there were to go to an y leng ths not to po rtray the British fighting men a nd women a s fighters. They wanted to ha ve them there a s 'nation bu ilders'. The media monitors would ge t very, very upset with you very fast and threats were levelled aga inst you that you would be d isembedded.\"29 The 700 journalists at CentCom m ilitary comm and in Qatar were suppo sed to b e there to g et the 'big picture' from those running-the war hund reds of miles from where the bullets were flying. Instead they were played like a violin. The Correspondent programm e showed a list on the wall of the British military media office a t CentCom. The list was headed \"Poo Traps\" and reminded the spok esmen o f the subjects to avoid in interviews with journalists: These included \"depleted u ranium\", \"bombing acc uracy\" and \"market bombings\". Don't talk abou t anything that the public have a right to know; only say what is good for the image you are trying to give them. Paul Hunter of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said: \"At the e nd o f the day when you try to make a news s tory ou t of whatever happens here, you still have to u se their message track, the one thing they are going to answer to every single question and it has gon e on every single day.\" 30 Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary o f Defense, said in a briefing p aper to h is war spinners that \"shaping world o pinion was"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 111 priority n umber one\".31 Despite this blatant bias, the British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon , had the audacity to say that people should b e sceptical abou t reports that do no t come from official sources. 32 ' •. The American n etworks were given the front seats in the daily CentCom 'briefings' (of lies), then came journalists from the 'allies', with the others at the back. The spinners watched from the sidelines gesturing to the spok esmen, usually the unb elievably arrogant Genera1\"Vincent Brook s. Both the Bush White House a nd Blair's Downing Street sent representatives to CentCom to spin on their behalf .. Bush's guy was J im Wilkinson. He looked straight out of high school and was definitely in the Vincent Brook s class of undiluted arrogance. Wilkinson is a c ivilian, but insisted on p rancing around CentCom throughout the war in a military u niform even thou gh the only action h e had any chance of seeing, was on the bank o f TV screens. He look ed like a refugee from Masturbators Anony mous. At one 'briefing' Michael Wolf of the New York Magazine asked Brook s \"the question that every reporter was asking, not just every d ay, but literally every minute\" .33 It was this: \"Why should we stay, what's the value to u s of what we learn at this milli on do llar press centre?\" The question brought applause from other journalists equally sick o f being manipulated. Brook s replied: \"It's you r choice; we want to p rovide . information that's truthful from the operational headqu arters that is runn ing this war.\" A lie, Mr. Brook s, yet another one. Michael Wolf told the Correspondent documentary what happened n ext: \"I was approached b y a guy named Wilkinson. He was a civilian, also he was wearing a uniform, which was odd and I said 'aren't you a civilian?' He said 'I'm in the Reserves'. I said, 'but you're not here in the Reserves'. He said 'right, right'. So I said so you're a kind o f paramilitary. So we imm ediately got off to the wrong foot. He said 'this is fucking war asshole. Don't fuck around with things y ou don't understand'. And then finally it was 'no more que stions for you, why don't you just go home?'\" 34 This is how journalists are intimidated into line. Play by ou r rules or you 're out of the loop . The rules included pressure not to ask follow up qu estions that would expo se the lies of the official statements by Brook s and Franks. Wilkinson ~ d the BBC : \"If people didn't like the way we handled it, I would think, one part of it, just a plain case of too b ad, and the second p robably a little e nvy on the part of those who were not embedded. The real superstars of this war were the ones who were e mbedded.\" And that is what war is to these idiots: a Hollywood p roduction:- The same with many o f the 'superstars' of the television n etworks. They are more concerned with their parting and p rofile thC\\Il ever they are with facts. True to their Orwellian methodology the CentCom 'briefings' - the \"platform for truth\" in the words of General Tomm y Franks - were used to tell a stream of lies. As I have been saying for more than a decade, it's all a mind g ame a nd no trick is missed. The backdrop for this daily d ece ption was built at a cost to American taxpayers of $200 ,000 by George Allison, one of Hollywood's leading art directors.35 He designed the set for ABC's Good Morning A11Jerica and h as worked with MGM and Disney. He was also fresh from his latest Michael Douglas film, It Run s in the Family. Allison, who h as designed White House backdrops for President Bush and, very appropriately, worked with the illusionist David Blaine, was flown into Qatar as part of a reputed on e million do llar conv ersion o f a-storage hangar into a high-tech hub for the international media.36 As one report said o f the set: \"Gone are the ea sel and chart, solitary television and VCR' machine with which General Norman Schwarzkopf showed fuzzy image s of smart-bomb raids during the 1 991 Gulf War. On a set that will become instantly recognisable, generals will present updates from two p odiums at the front of a stage a dorned with five 50in plasma screens and two 70 in television projection screen s read y to show maps, graphics and videos of action. \"Behind them will be a soft-focus elongated map of the world, as if to sugge st that the world is united behind them. The set was built in Chicago a nd reputedly s hipped over by Federal Express at a cost of $47 ,000 (£29,000).\" 37 While the troop s go to war on their victims, their masters go to war on the pub lic mind. We a re e xperiencing a world d escribed so eloquently by George Orwell. It is a world that is abou t image, not substance, and on e in which lies are truth, war is peace and d ictatorship is liberation. The Newspeak, the false e nemies, the presentation o f fascism as freedom, are a ll in Orwell's predictions for the society we a re now living in. Too dangerous to investigate A number of non -embedded journalists, known as \"independents\" or \"unilaterals\" were killed o r injured while covering the war independently o f the military. This s uited the a uthorities beca use the fewer of those types of reporters to b e deployed in future c onflicts the better it is for those who want to control information. \"See, it is very d angerous, so stay with u s and you 'll be fine if you follow the rules.\" US spok esman Jim Wilkinson said o f the independent journalists: \"They were a pain in our rear a lot of times. They would turn up on the battlefield despite our warnings/' Richard Sambrook, head o f BBC News, said h e would h ave liked more non -embedded journalists, but it was just \"too d angerous\". Funny ho w so many no n-embedded reporters died in such a short war. Ten journalists were killed includ ing ITN's Terry Lloyd , who was s hot by American troop s in a vehicle clearly marked 'TV'. Ironically, he was only at that location b eca use the military spok esmen h ad lied abou t the \"fall\" of the port town o f Umm Qasr. That had b een Lloyd 's original destination b efore the false information was fed to the media. The town actually \"fell\" some 17 d ays after the mendacious military claimed it was taken. A U S tank attacked the Palestine Hotel in Baghd ad, the base of the international journalists, killing two cameramen and injuring three others. There is no way this was a mistake a nd no r was it, as the ludicrous US milit ary claimed, in retaliation for shots coming from the hotel. Strange how no on e in a hotel full of journalists saw or heard any such shoo ting. Anyway, are these prats in un iform really saying that in respon se to small arms fire from a hotel full of people you just blast tank shells at the building? It was planned, of course it was, and the same with the missile a ttacks (sorry accidents) on Arab televisi9p facilities in Baghd ad in which a journalist from al-Jazeera died. The journalists were killed and injured in d aylight at locations kno wn to the Pentagon to be media sites. The manipulation o f information through the media is their greatest weapon for the c ontrol of the people a nd they don 't want any maverick independents telling the truth they 'don 't want the pub lic to h ear. Two 'non -embedded' journalists told Arab News of their outrageous treatment at the hands of American troop S.38 Luis Castro and Victor Silva, both reporters working for RTP P ortugu ese television, were held for"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 112 four days. They said they were beaten, had their equipment, vehicle a nd v ideo tapes confiscated, and were then escorted ou t of Ir aq by the 101 st Airborne Division. This was despite holding the proper Unilateral Journalist acc reditation issued by the Coalition Forces Central Comm and. Castro said: \"I have covered 10 wars in the past six y ears - in Ango la, Afghan istan, Zaire and East Timor. I have been arrested three times in Africa, but have ne ver been subjected to such treatment or been physically bea ten before. The Americans c all themselves liberators and freedom fighters, but look what they have done to u s.\" 39 The pair had b een to Umm Qasr and Basra a nd were travelling to Najaf when they were stopp ed by the military police. Castro said acc redited identification was checked and they were given the a ll clear to p rocee d. \"Suddenly, for no reason, the situation changed\", Castro told Arab News. 40 The soldiers ordered them to lie on the groun d, he said, and they stepped on their hands and b acks and h andcuffed them. \"The soldiers used ou r satellite phones to call their families at home\", Castro said, \"I begged them to allow me to u se my o wn phon e to call my family, but they refused. When I protested, they pu shed me to the ground and kicked me in the ribs and legs.\" Castro said h e believed they were detained b ecause they were not embedded with the US forces: \"Embed ded journalists are a lways escorted b y military minders. What they write is c ontrolled and , through them, the military feeds its own version of the facts \\ ~ the world. When independent journalists s uch a s us c ome around, we pose a threat because they c annot control what we write.\" 41 Castro said a lieutenant in charge of the military p olice had told him: \"My men are like dog s, they are trained only to attack, please try to und erstand.\" U What chance do the c hildren in Iraq h ave, eh? One soldier, who Castro asked no t be identified, wrote out a note, which was s hown to Arab News. It said: \"I am so sorry that you had to endu re such b ad conditions, but remember that I care and p ray you can forgive.\" Castro said the US troop s were \"totally crazy\" and his treatment was typical of the American attitude, as confirmed to him by British forces. The attitude was \"shoo t first and ask qu estions later.\" 43 Planting the e vidence Once the liberation o f Ir aq h ad left the people without water or electricity and caused tens of thou sands to b e killed and injured b eyond words, the inevitable followed amid the devastation and chaos. Looting erupted on a massive scale, just as the Illuminati place men kn ew that it would. Iraqi banks were destroyed and with them went the life savings of untold n umbers of Ir aqis and their families. But this s uited the manipulators perfectly beca use the more the financial system was dismantled, the ea sier it would b e for the United States to replace it with on e in their own image: Businesses and ho mes of the Iraqi people were looted and d estroyed and the gov ernment buildings that had no t been h it by US and British b ombing were looted and bu rned together with the files of evidence e xpo sing the links between Saddam Hussein's regime a nd the very forces that had no w arrived to take over. But despite a ll of this, somehow, miraculously, files were found by journalists in these buildings to link Saddam Hussein with Osama bin Laden and to claim that the British Labou r MP George Galloway took milli ons in b ack-hand p ayments from Saddam. Galloway just happened to b e one of the most vociferous campaigners against the war. I have never met Galloway and I did not care at all for , his public suppo rt for Sad d am Hussein, but find ing the e vidence a gainst him so easily in such circumstances is extremely conv enient and typ ical of the way these guy s operate. Galloway said: “... The go vernment enlisted the Murdoch press to laun ch an a ssault on me with the journalistic equ ivalent of a cluster bomb. The central thrust of their attacks , that I am a traitor not fit to sit in pa rliament, was sc attered over the Sun., . News of the World, Times and Sunday Times ... That Tony Blair has taken New Labour into the outer limits of social democratic politics, a kind o f twilight zone where, in the d imness, an a xis of Bush, Blair, Berlusconi, Aznar and Sharon can just be g limpsed, is pretty much a g iven. But his alliance with the cheap jingo press, which is s preading racist hatred in this c onflict, is a key development in the war for Labour's future. This latest attack on me, for example, was fed to a willing p ress by Labour sources. I know this because the national newspaper editor who was first offered the 'story' (a transcript of a translated interview I gave to Abu Dhabi TV) turned it down a nd a lerted me. It was then g iven to the Sun. The transcribed words were mine; the spin was all New Labour's.\" 44 The Arab satellite television company al-Jazeera also sacked its chief executive, Mohamm ed Jassem al-Ali, after his name a ppeared in a document 'found ' in the same way that appeared to link him with Iraqi intelligence. Al-Jazeera broadcast· horrendou s pictures of Ir aqi civilian casualties during the war that western stations would not air. Conv enient indeed that with so many files burned and d estroyed and amid such chaos, that the 'evidence' was found to incriminate people that Blair, Bush and Co wanted to d estroy. The UK Guardian newspaper reported du ring the invasion o f Afghanistan that journalists had d escribed ho w they were directed by the a uthorities to b uildings in Kabul and o ther locations to 'find' apparent proof of al-Qaeda's involvement in the 9/11 hijackings. This included, the paper said, new box cutters s till in their packaging and a freshly tom page from an American magazine detailing Florida flying schools. 45 Oh, please. This is what they think about the mentality o f the media a nd, sure e noug h, these 'finds' were reported as if they were genuine. Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, a former naval officer and author of The Handboo k of Personal Data Protection,46 produ ced an excellent analysis of such 'evidence' in the Online16.urna l of April 29th 2 003. 47 He said that after the United States and Britain were shown to b e providing b ogus and plagiarized 'intelligence' documents to the UN Security Coun cil that suppo sedly 'proved' Saddam Hussein's weapon s of mass destruction p rogramm e, the world's media was now being fed a steady stream of captured Iraqi 'intelligence' documents from the rubb le of Iraq's Mukh abarat intelligence headqu arters. The problem with these documents, Madsen wrote, was that they were being p rovided by the US military to a few reporters working for a \"very suspect newspaper\", the London Daily Telegraph. The Sund ay edition o f the Telegraph on April 27th 2 003 h ad reported ho w its correspond ent in Baghd ad, Inigo Gilmore, had b een invited into the intelligence headqu arters by US troop s and miraculously 'found ' amid the rubble a document indicating that Iraq inv ited Osama bin Laden to v isit Iraq in March 1998 . Gilmore further reported that the CIA had b een through the building several times before he found the document and that the intelligence a gency must have 'missed' the document in their prior searches. This was an"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 113 astoun ding claim, said Wayne Madsen, since the CIA must have been intimately familiar with the building from their previous intelligence links with the Mukhabarat dating from the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980 s. Also, the CIA and o ther intelligence a gencies, including Britain's MI-6, had refuted claims of a link b etween Osama bin Laden and Iraq. Madsen wrote: \"Gilmore told the SS G that he noticed that on the Mukhabarat do cuments he d iscovered some information that was 'erased'. The e rasures were a pparently made with a combination of black marker ink and correction fluid. He said he scraped away at the p aper with a razor and miraculously found the na me b in Laden in three p laces. The standard p rocedure for redacting a classified do cument is to on ly use a b lack inde lible marker to mask classified information. However, the p roper procedure for trying to read through such markings is not to scrape away the ink as if the do cument were an instant lottery ticket. Toner print often b leeds .through the indelible marker ink. If one holds up such a sheet of paper at a 45-degree a ngle and under a bright phosphorescent light, the lettering u nder the ink c an be 'read' because the lettering a lmost appears to be 'raised'. If a razor blade were u sed to scrape away the markings, the indelible ink -and the toner ink would be obliterated. Gilmore's claims app ear to be spurious. n 48 This Iraqi-al-Qaeda 'smoking g un' was blasted across the news with the help o f the CIA-Pentagon stoog e, Ahmed Chalabi, head o f the CIA-fund ed Iraqi National Congress. He told Murdoch's Fox News that the document provided enou gh information that Saddam Hussein was kno wledgeable a bou t the September 11th attacks on the United States. Once a gain the familiar names appear. Telegraph newspapers are owned by the Hollinger Corporation o f Conrad Black, who h as been featured in many o f my b ooks. He is an extremely active member of the Illuminati Bilderberg Group (see And The Truth S hall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret for the detailed b ackground). Hollinger owns the Jerusalem Post, a director of which is Richard Perle, the Pentagon advisor who was heavily invo lved in plans for the war on Iraq. The National Interest, another pro- Bush pu blication, is also funded by Black. 49 Perle's friend, William Kristol, the c hairman o f the Project for the New American Century, appeared on Fox News to suppo rt th ~ sign ificance of the documents 'found ' in Iraq. He said the e xpo sure of Galloway for accepting money from Saddam Hussein was the \"tip o f the iceberg\" and sugg ested with no evidence a t all that French President Jacques Chirac, other Western po liticians and Arab journalists working for such n etworks as AI-Jazeera, would soon b e 'outed' by further Ir aqi intelligence documents.50 He was right abou t AI-Jazeera, so ho w did h e kno w that was going to h appen? Fox News also said that Galloway might have given classified satellite imagery to al-Qaeda, again with no evidence presented to suppo rt the slander. This was Wayne Madsen's s umm ary o f how he believes the propaganda works: \"Phone y documents are 'dropped' into the hands of a right-wing L ondon n ewspaper owned b y Conrad Black. They are a mplified b y Black's other holdings, including the Jerusalem Post and Chicago Sun-Times. The story is then p icked up b y the worldwide television ou tlets of News Corporation, Time Warner, Disney and General Electric and e choed on the right-wing radio talk s hows of Clear Channel and Viacom. Political careers are damaged o r destroyed. There is no right of rebuttal for the a ccused. They are guilty as c harged b y a whipped up p ublic that gets its information from the Orwellian telescreens of the corporate media ... The media o perating in concert with political vermin to whip up p opular opinion to stamp ou t criticism is nothing n ew. It was practiced by Joseph Goebbels quite effectively in Nazi Germany.\"51 The United States has been qu ite ac tive in inviting Telegraph reporters into the Iraqi intelligence headqu arters, Madsen po inted o ut, and o ther documents 'found ' by its reporters 'revealed' that Russian intelligence had p assed intercepts of Tony Blair's phon e c onv ersations to Iraqi intelligence; that German intelligence offered to assist Iraqi intelligence in the lead-up to the war;.-and that France provided Iraq with the c ontents of US-French diplomatic e xchanges. All of these 'finds' suited the a genda of the United States and Britain. Madsen said it was amazing that the US military would b e so op en abou t letting favou red journalists walk freely abou t the Mukh abarat building when the Pentagon h as classified tight security on the Iraqi Oil Ministry. The reason for this was obv ious, he wrote. While the Mukh abarat building could b e salted with phon ey intelligence documents, the Oil Ministry was likely to b e rife with documents s howing the links between Saddam Hussein and Dick Cheney's company, Halliburton (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). Halliburton signed more than $73 milli on in contracts with Saddam's gov ernment when Cheney was its chief executive officer through two subsidiaries, Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll Dresser Pump Co, and this was part of the same UN oil-for-food p rogramm e invo lved in the a llegations against George Galloway. 52 Destroying the e vidence The worst of the (coordinated) looting frenzy after the American forces arrived targeted some of the most important and p riceless artefacts and manuscripts anywhere in the world at the Baghd ad museums containing relics and do cumentation o f human history go ing b ack to ancient Sumer (4000 to 2 000 BC ). This was also p art of the information and kno wledge spin. I have written extensively ov er the years abou t the Illuminati blood line conn ections to Sumer and Babylon and I will later put that in context with current events. Enough to say for . now that the Illuminati do no t want their origins expo sed and removing the e vidence from public a nd aca demic view w ould b e e xtremely important to them. Iraq is in the land o f ancient Mesopo tamia, the 'Land Between the Rivers', on the banks of the Tigris and Euph rates. The Mesopo tamians were the first kno wn p eople to study the stars, develop the written word and enforce a legal code. It was, say h istorians, the 'Cradle of Civilisation' and the location o f the Biblical Garden o f Eden. The c oun try's museums, galleries and libraries were looted o f their fantastic c ontents from these a ncient societies and torched into empty shells almost overnight while the American forces did no thing. Dr Moayad Damerji, the professor of archaeology at Baghd ad University and the former director general of the Iraqi Department of Antiquities, said the objects and artefacts charting h uman d evelopment had v anished and their loss was imm easurable. \"The Iraqi National Museum is the only museum in the world which shows all the steps in the history o f mankind\", he said. \"These witnesses to our own d evelopment have gon e, they are gon e.\" 53 Among the most priceless treasures missing are the Vase of Uruk and the Harp o f Ur, dating b ack to b etween 3000 and 2500 BC and the rule of the Sumerian kings (who conn ect into the Illuminati bloodlines, see The Biggest Secret and Children o f the Matrix). The e xqu isite bronze"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 114 Statue of Basitki from the Akkadian kingdom is also g one, removed d espite its enormous weight. The heads of stone statues were decapitated and p recious inscribed tablets from the great Sumedan libraries lost - the very accoun ts of human h istory I have highlighted in my bo oks in connection to the Illuminati blood lines. The tablets record Sumerian history, life a nd b elief, and almost certainly the origin o f the bloodlines that rule the world ~ today. It was the same story across the c oun try. In Mosul in the north, close to where the Sumerian Tablets were unearthed, the c ontents of the museum disappeared. The 2,000 -year-old statue of King Saqnatroq II, one of Mesopo tamia's forgotten monarchs, was taken, along with irreplacea ble Assyrian antiquities. Assyria . ~ - followed the Sumerian civilisation. Compounding the c rime is that the Baghd ad museum also lost the ca rd catalogu e a nd comp)1ter records, making it far more difficult to track the stolen p iece s. Lost, too, are the find ings of generations of archaeological study b eca use the details of all excavations in Iraq by international teams of archaeologists had to b e reported to the museum. In the words of one writer: \"It threatens to turn the clock b ack more than 150 y ears to the period b efore scientific a rchaeology in Mesopo tamia.\" 54 I am sure that some a rtefacts were removed by museum staff before the invasion, but it was also clear that the looting that followed the bombing was allowed and encouraged to h appen by US authorities who wanted to destroy the Iraqi's s pirit and sense of identity, as well as s tealing the a rtefacts that are so important to them for historical and ritual reasons. People who kn ew w hat they were looking for coldly and d eliberately planned much o f the looting in the museums and g alleries. In the ruins of the Saddam Arts Center in Baghd ad, Iraqi artist Moayad al-Haidari said the looting h ad b een well organised. It was not just theft; t he a im was much bigger than that. \"This is to u ndermine us, our heritage,_ our identity, our pride.\" 55 Tareq Abdulrazak, a 63-year-old scientist, stood outside the c harred and smouldering shell of Ir aq's national library, where e very book and manuscript has been d estroyed. \"Here was Iraq's culture, ancient and modem, all in writing\", he said. \"The Americans watched this happen; It is not enough to d estroy our buildings, our people? Now our history too?\" 56 It was one of the key aims of the 'war' to rape the museums of their priceless contents. Moayad Damerji of the Iraqi National Museum rightly said that the raid on his building was planned in advance. \"This was a program, well organized. The Americans protected the oilfields, but did n othing to p rotect our museum, but they are obliged to p rotect . these sites\", he said. 57 Dr Dony George, head o f the Museum of History in Baghd ad, told the media how professional experts had carried ou t the looting. He showed journalists a handful of diamond glasscutters found on the premises and believed to h ave been u sed by \"the professional antiqu ity thieves\" to cut glass and 'access delicate e xhibits. The thieves had equipment to lift the heaviest objects and k eys to the vaults where the most valuable items were stored. Dr George said: \"I believe they were people who kn ew w hat they wanted. They h ad p assed by the gyp sum copy o f the Black Obelisk. This means that they must have been specialists. They d id not touch those copies.\"58 He told Britain's Channel 4 News that among the a rtefacts that have been stolen were the sacred v ase of Warka, a 5,OOO-year-old g olden v essel found at Ur, an Akkadian statue base a nd an Assyrian statue. This has been described as like stealing the Mona Lisa. The online version o f Business Week magazine said: \"It was almost as if the perpetrators were waitin g for Baghd ad to fall to make their move. Gil J. Stein, a professor of archaeology at the University of Chicago, which ha s been conducting d igs in Iraq for 80 years, believes that dea lers ordered the most important pieces well in a dvance. '!hey were looking for very s pecific artefacts,' he says. 'They k new where to look.'\" 59 Experts confirmed that the looters also kn ew w hat they were looking for at the museum in Mosul and in less than 10 minutes they h ad taken several milli on do llars worth o f Parthian sculpture. Where were the American troop s? Shortly b efore the invasion, the American Coun cil for Cultural Policy (ACC P), a c oalition o f American antiqu ities collectors and arts lawyers, met with o fficials from the US Defense and State Departments to o ffer their assistance in p reserving Iraq's archaeological collections.60 This is another pig trough op eration. Within this group are dealers who wanted to see a n end to the strict Iraqi laws on the ownership and expo rt of antiqu ities. The group 's treasurer, William Pearlstein, described the laws as 'retention ist', (i.e. greedy d ealers couldn't get their hands on them) and h e has said h e suppo rted a post-war gov ernment that would make it easier to h ave a ntiquities dispersed to the US. Those who care a bou t protecting history rather than p rofiting from its exploitation h ave had d eep suspicions abou t this group, which was only created in 2001 after the Bush administration came to illegal power. Professor Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, a Cambridge a rchaeologist and director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said: \"Iraqi antiqu ities legislation p rotects Iraq. The last thing on e needs is s ome group o f dealer-conn ected .Americans interfering. Any change to those laws would b e a bsolutely monstrous.\" ~ 2 The Archaeological Institute of America a greed, saying that any weakening of Ir aq's strict antiquities laws would b e \"disastrous\".63 The president, Patty Gerstenblith, said: \"The [American Coun cil for Cultural Policy] agenda is to encourage the c ollecting o f antiquities through weakening the laws of archaeologically-rich n ations and eliminate national ownership o f antiqu ities to allow for easier expo rt.\" 64 News of the meeting with gov ernment officials led to fears that restrictions of expo rting Iraqi artefacts would be e ased after the war, but what happened was even far worse than that. The heritage that belongs to all humanity is now flooding the und erground markets in Illuminati hands and the ground is being p repared to allow their legal importation into the United States. Professor John Merryman o f Stanford Law Schoo l, a member of the American Coun cil for Cultural Policy, called for a \"selective international enforcement of expo rt controls\" in US courts that would make it quite lawful to import objects s ystematically looted from Baghd ad if a US court choo ses not to recogn ise Iraqi legislation.6S He argues that the fact that an art object had b een stolen did no t, in itself, bar it from lawful importation into the United States. Among the reasons for the orchestrated looting was to d estroy as much o f Islamic history as possible beca use they kno w they h ave to d ismantle the power of Islam to b ring abou t their world state. Washington investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, was right on when h e wrote: \"Bush and h is advisers, previously warned that Iraq's ancient artifacts and col la tion of historical documents and boo ks were in danger of being loo ted o r destroyed, instead , sat back while the Baghdad a nd Mosul museums and Baghdad L ibrary were ransacked a nd de stroyed. Cult leaders have h istorically attempted to destroy history in o rder to invent their own. The Soviets tried to ob literate Russia's Orthodox traditions, taming a nu mber of churches into warehouses and an imal barns. Cambodia's Pol Pot tried to wipe ou t Buddhism's famed Angkor Wat shrine in an attempt to stamp ou t his c oun try's Buddh ist history. In March 2001 , while they were"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 115 negotiating with the Bush administration on a natural gas pipeline, Afghanistan's Taliban b lew up two massive 1 60o-year old Buddhas in Bamiyan. The Bush ad ministration, itself run b y fanatic religious c ultists, barely made a fuss about the loss· of the relics. It would not be the first time the cultists within the Bush administration ignored the p illaging of history's treasures. The ransacking of Iraq's historical treasures is explainable when one considers what the b lood cult Christians really think about Islam.\" 66 However, they are not \"Christians\", they are practicing Satanists (see my o ther book s) and b lood cult sums them up. Calculated catastrophe The American gov ernment was given high ly d etailed information abou t the museums, their location and contents, and the historic a rchaeological sites around the c oun try. It was supp lied by experts who were deeply concerned abou t the c onsequences of the US and British invasion. This included the United Nations agency, UN ESCO, who p rovided maps s pecific to these locations. Professor Elizabeth C. Stone, the head o f the Department of Anthropology o f the New Y ork State University at Stony Brook, who carried ou t research and excavation in Iraq b etween ~ 987 and 199 0, told Fox News that she had written to the Pentagon and US forces asking them to take a ll possible measures to safeguard the treasures. She especially emphasised the Museum of History in Baghd ad, the world's only treasure of invaluable a ntiquities dating b ack to the first civilisations in ancient Mesopo tamia a nd Babylonia. Professor Stone said that she received assurance from US forces that the museum would b e protected as a matter of utmost importance. But when the museum was raped and ransacked by looters, American troop s were nowhere to b e seen, exactly as always planned. Professor Stone rightly compared the looting o f the Baghd ad Museum with the burning o f the Great Library at Alexandria by the (Illuminati-controlled) Roman Empire or the rape of Aztec a nd Inca c ultures by the (Illuminati-controlled) conq uistadors from Spain. Iraq, said Stone, is a c oun try \"who's past has been d ecapitated\".67 Yet, as Dr Ir ving Finkel of the British Museum told Britain's Channel 4 News, the looting was \"entirely p redictable a nd could easily h ave been stopp ed\".h8 British journalist Robert Fisk ran to g et US marines in an attempt to save some of the ce nturies-old illuminated copies of the Koran, other Islamic ca lligraphy, documents from the Ottoman Empire a nd o ther irreplacea ble texts when the looting b egan at the National Library. But the Marines refused to respond . Fisk wrote in the Ind ependent newspaper: \"I gave the map location, the p recise na me in Arabic and English. I said the smoke could be seen from three miles away and it would take on ly five minutes to d rive there. Half an hour later, there wasn't an American a t the scene a nd the flames were shoo ting 2 00 feet into the a ir.\" 69 Nothing was don e because it wasn't meant to b e don e. Fisk told ho w an \"army o f thieves\" stormed the headqu arters of UN ICEF, which h as been working to improve the lives of Ir aqi children since the 1980 s, \"throwing b rand n ew pho tocopiers on top o f eac h o ther and sending cascades of UN files on child diseases, pregnancy d eath rates and nu trition across the £1oo rs\".70 As the occupying power, wrote Fisk, America was respon sible for protecting embassies and UN offices in their area of control, but he saw U S troop s driving p ast the German embassy as looters carried d esks and chairs out of the front gate: \"It is a scandal, a kind o f disease, a mass form of kleptomania that American troop s are blithely igno ring.\" Where are the troops? Try the oil ministry. American troop s allowed the mobs to loot and d estroy the Ministry o f Planning, Ministry o f Education, Ministry o f Irr igation, Ministry o f Trade, Ministry o f Industry, Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, Ministry o f Culture and Ministry o f Information and they refused to stop the looting o f Ir aq's priceless historical treasures. But hund reds of soldiers were deployed to d efend two ministries and they remained und amaged - the Ministry o f Oil and the Ministry o f the Interior with its vast library o f intelligence information abou t the c oun try. A w hole company o f Marines, along with at least a half-dozen amphibious assault vehicles was assigned to gu ard the Ministry o f Oil, while the ones respon sible for trade, information, planning, health and education (all those the US wants to reform in its own image) were left to their fate. Frank Viviano pu t it very well in the San Francisco Chron icle long b efore the Iraq invasion: \"The h idden stakes in the war against terrorism can be summed up in a single word: oil. The map of terrorist sanctuaries and targets in the Middle East and Central Asia is also, to an e xtraordinary degree, a map o f the world's principal energy s ources in the 21 st century ... It is inevitable that the war against terrorism will be seen by many as a war on beha lf of America's Chevron, Exxon and Arco; France's TotalFinaElf; British Petroleum; Royal Dutch Shell and o ther multinational giants, which h ave hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the region.\" 71 Even more so no w. American troops \"encouraged\" looting. No, really? BB C N ews Online reported on May 6 th 2003 ho w General Tommy Franks was threatened with a Belgian war crimes trial alleging that US troop s failed to p revent looting in Iraq and the website said it had uncovered information suggesting that his s oldiers even\" egged o n\" some looters. Dr Khalid Majeed d escribed ho w he tried in v ain to p ersuade American troop s to p rotect the Nasiriya Technical Institute of higher education from a mob o f looters, but they refused every time. Dr Majeed, a comm unity h ealth lecturer at the c ollege, said the crowd carried kn ives and Kalashnikovs and they were shou ting, \"We need everything from this college\". He said he went to an American checkpo int and asked for help, but they said they could no t come. Eventually, he said, a c olleague roused some Americans based n ear the local fire station. They arrived in five vehicles, but refused to stop the looters. Instead, the soldiers fired several dozen rounds at the c ollege's s outh wall, Dr Majeed said. \"It was a green light to the looters. It told them, 'We a re not going to do anything to stop you.'\" Within five minutes the Americans had gon e a nd the looters had moved in. The c ollege was soon little more"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 116 than a shell. Abou t 100 air condition ing u nits and 100 computers were stolen. Rooms were torched; the science laboratories wrecked; and the main lecture hall looked \"like a hurricane has passed through it\". But witnesses said that it was not only that the American troop s refused to stop the mob, the looting was openly encouraged. Rasool Abdul-Husayn, an un employed schoolteac her, said h e saw an American soldier signalling the c rowd to move in, with a repeated wave of the arm. Another eyewitness, Kareem Khattar, who works in a bread shop across the road from the c ollege, saw the same. \"I saw w ith my own e yes the Americans s igna l the p eople to move in a nd the looters s tarted clapping. The Americans waved b ye-bye and the looters were clapping. They s tarted looting quickly and when one man came out with an a ir conditioner an American said to h im 'Good, very good'.\" 72 In a statement to BB C News Online, CentCom, the United States Central Comm and in Doha\" Qatar, refused to accept respon sibilit y for the e vent. Nothing n ew there then. More c onfirmation o f the e ncouragement the milit ary g ave to looters came from Khaled Bayomi in an interview w ith Dagens Nyheter, Sweden's largest newspaper based in Stockho lm.? Khaled Bayomi has taugh t and researched abou t Middle Eastern conflicts for ten y ears at the University o f Lund and h ad travelled to Baghd ad to b e a 'human shield' in suppo rt of the Iraqis during the c onflict. \"I happened to b e right there just as the American troop s encouraged p eople to b egin the plund ering \", he told the paper. He said h e went to see some friends who live near a dilapidated area on the west bank o f the Tigris on April 8th and the fighting was s o intense he couldn't get back. In the a fternoon it beca me quiet and four American tanks took up place s on the e dge of the slum area. The soldiers s hot two Sudanese guards, he said, who stood at their posts outside a local administration bu ilding. Then they b lasted apart the doo rs to the building and from the tanks came\" eager calls in Arabic\" encouraging p eople to come c lose to them: \"The en tire morning, everyone who had tried to cross the road h ad b een shot. But in the strange silence after all the shoo ting, people gradua lly became curious. After 45 minutes, the first Baghdad citizens dared to come out. Arab interpreters in the tanks told the p eople to go a nd take what they wanted in the bu ilding. The word spread qu ickly and the bu ilding was ransacked. I was s tand ing on ly 300 yards from there when the guards were murdered. Afterwards the tank c rushed the en trance to the Justice Department, which was in a neighboring building, and the p lundering continued there. I stood in a large crowd a nd watched this toge ther with them. They did not partake in the p lundering but dared not to interfere. Many had tears of shame In their eyes. The next morning the p lundering spread to the Modern Museum, which lies a quarter mile farther north. There w e re also two crowds there, one that plundered a nd o ne which watched with d isgust.\" He was asked if he was saying that American troop s instigated the looting: \"Absolutely. The lack of jubilant scene s meant that the American troops needed p ictures of Iraqis who in different ways demonstrated ha tred for Saddam's regime.\" But what abou t the people who pulled down a large statue of Saddam? he was asked. \"Did they? It was an American tank that did that, right beside the hotel where a ll the journalists s tay. Until lunchtime on April 9, I did no t see one destroyed Saddam portrait. I f people h ad wanted to pull down statues they c ould h ave taken d own some of the. small one s without any help from American tanks. If it had been a political upheaval, the people would h ave pulled d own statues first and then p lundered.\" 74 Baghdad did n ot fall - it was handed over Did y ou no tice that the invasion o f Afghanistan was to \"get Bin Laden\", but they didn't? And to \"get Mullah Omar\", the \"spiritual\" leader of the Taliban, but they didn't? The whole basis of the invasion o f Ir aq was, in effect, to \"get Saddam Hussein\", but they didn't, or least at the time I write long after the 'war'. With so many Saddam look-alikes around , how w ould we kno w even if they claimed to? I think we can see a pattern h ere. In the opening d ays of the Iraqi war the American and British forces faced some serious oppo sition in the southern towns and cities, as they made their way no rth from Kuwait. If they could face that kind o f resistance in the south, it was fairly assumed that they were in for one hell of a battle to take the c apital, Baghd ad. But this didn't happen. Some terrible milit ary d ecisions were made that sent Iraq troop s into conflict with the 'coalition' in the open d esert where their firepower had no t an earthly chance of competing with the state of the a rt technology they faced. However, the most effective use of those troop s would h ave ca used the British and Americans s ome serious problems. Was this s imply incompetence or was there a deal at the highest levels? Most bizarre was that as the Iraqi troop s retreated, not a single bridge was destroyed to thwart or slow the British and American advance. Why to goodn ess not??? It is basic defensive warfare that you take out bridges you r enemy n eeds to advance once it is clear you can no longer defend them. This is especially true in Iraq, which is dominated by the two rivers, the Tigris and Euph rates. Instead, the bridges were left for the British and American troop s to cross. Why? Robert Fisk in the UK Independent quo ted an Iraqi brigadier-general comm anding Baghd ad's missile a ir defences as saying that entire Repub lican Guard regiments were withdrawn from the desert west of Baghd ad on the orders Saddam's s on, Qusay. These soldiers that were vital to the c ity's defense took o ff their uniforms and went home. 75 \"Our troop s/were fighting in the south much b etter than around Baghd ad\", the general said. \"They had h elp from the people in the villages.

Following this pause, the paper said, suspicions rose when US troop s, which h ad b een stopp ed at the Euph rates, were imm ediately able to advance toward into the heart of Baghd ad without any further significant resistance by Iraqi forces. \"Nobody asked why Tikrit, that was once c alled the ideolog ical heart of Saddam's gov ernment and the last possible trench o f the Iraqi army, was never targeted by US and British b ombs and missiles\", the Times pointed out. \"Or why, when the e lite Iraqi forces arrived in eastern Iraq from Tikrit, the pace of the invaders advancing toward central Baghd ad imm ediately increased.\" 79 It was also reported in early April that a plane had b een authorized to leave Iraq bound for Russia, the paper said. \"Who was aboard this plane?\" The Times continued: \"All these a mbiguities, the contradictory reports about Saddam's s ituation, and the fact that the h ighest-ranking Iraqi officials were a ll represented b y a single individual - Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed ['Comical Aii'] al-Sahhaf - and the ea sy fall of Baghdad shows that the center of collusion had been Tikrit, where Saddam, his aides, and lieutenan ts from the Ba'ath Party had been waiting for al-Sahhaf to join them so that they c ould receive the required g uarantees to leave the country in a secret compromise with coalition forces.’’ \"This possibility was c onfirmed b y the AI-Jazeera ne twork, which quoted a Russian intelligence official as saying that the Iraqi forces and the invaders had made a deal. The Russian official told AI-Jazeera that the Iraqi leaders had a greed to show no serious resistance aga inst the US-British troops in return for a g uarantee that Saddam and h is c lose relatives c ould lea ve Iraq un harmed.\" 80 The paper pointed to the c omm on theme of Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. \"Is there a ny sign t ~~ the US is interested in find ing them and wiping them out?\" 81 One should k now that these two, as US henchmen ov er the past decade, provided enough p retexts for the White House to do minate Afghanistan, even though they are still at large, the report went on. Washington b enefited from its inabilit y to find the Taiban and al-Qaeda leaders. The same held true with Saddam. A minor dictator like Saddam was like a pupp et that has danced for a lifetime to the tune of a ce rtain major dictator like the US and could no t act on his own, the paper said. Saddam did whatever the White House wanted h im to do for years, said the Times. \"Therefore, the simple a nswer to the question 'Where is Saddam?' is nothing b ut 'Wherever the US desires!'\" 82 I have heard it said by 'coalition' spok esmen that the Iraqis collapsed so q uickly b eca use they were poo rly trained and op erating with outdated and un maintained equipment. But how does that square, then, with Iraq being a threat to the world, including the United States on the other side of the globe? It doesn't because that was a lie. They lie to cover one question and lie a gain, using the oppo site stance, to cover another. Doubles crossed? The obsession with selling a fable to the public means that we have to b e ca utious abou t everything we a re told - everything, no matter how apparently convincing it may at first appear to b e. This includes the deaths of Saddam's s ons, Day and Qusay, or any o ther 'targets', like Saddam himself, who are a nnoun ced to b e dead after publication o f this book. For a start they h ave many doub les, as widely reported no w, and Saddam and his brood h ave been \"killed\" a number of times before it was confirmed that they h ad no t. The sons were suppo sed to h ave been k illed, together with Saddam's 14-yepr-old g randson and a \"bodyguard\", in a shoo t out with American troop s at a hou se in Mosul. The official story go es that these four guy s, one a 14-year-old, held ou t in a fire-fight against 200 h eavily armed members of the American 101 st Airborne Division - suppo rted by attack helicopters - for up to six h ours until they were strafed with b ullets. Yeah, that makes sense. This residence was a palatial villa belong ing to the local tribal leader. Two months earlier American tanks were parked ou tside beca use the residence was requisitioned by the military.83 As one Internet report said: \"It's like if Washington has been occupied by the Russians and Bush was hiding in the Oval Office.\" 84 The milit ary announ ced at first that the sons were extensively bu rned, possibly b eyond recogn ition, but then came the c onfident confirmations that they h ad 'proved' their identity. Photographs of them were then released after the bod ies had und ergon e \"facial reconstruction\" before they were shown to journalists. \"The two bo dies have und ergon e facial reconstruction with mortician's putty to make them resemble a s closely as possible the faces of the brothers when they were a live\", a military o fficial said. s5 What if the a uthorities s ay they h ave c onfirmed a DN A match in such circumstances? With their track record, how can you b elieve them? 'Freedom' to a gree The Illuminati manipulation o f reality is not on ly founded on lies. They must also supp ress the e xpo sure of the lies by attacking the freedom of expression. Nothing high lights the Alice in Wond erland illusion in which we live more, than the insane belief that we live in freedom. I am always s uspicious when a gov ernment has to continually tell the people how free they are. If the society was truly free it would b e patently ob vious, no words necessary. Instead the mantra of the 'free world' and the 'Land o f the Free' are parroted constantly and there is a good reason for this. The United States is actually a brutal dictatorship. While the slaughter of the, innocent was claimed to b e the 'liberation' of Ir aq and the replace ment of tyranny with 'freedom', back ho me, in the Land o f the Fee a nd Home of the Slave, freedom of expression was virtually d ead. In truth, it has long b een so, but it simply b eca me more blatant. If you spok e out against the ca rnage and the dismembering o f children and their parents you were attacked from all angles. Natalie Maines, a singer in the c oun try music group, the Dixie Chicks, only said that she was embarrassed that the president came from Texas and all hell ensued. They were vilified. A mob was organised to smash their CDs and much o f impetus for the boy cott of their records came from radio stations owned by Clear Channel Communications of Texas, which h as close ties with the Bush family. So Clear Channel stations also u rged p eople to arrange pro-war rallies. Roxanne Cordon ier, who used the name, Roxanne Walker, as a presenter on the Clear Channel station, WMYI-FM/MY 102 .5, alleged in a law suit that she was belittled, reprimanded and ultimately fired for disagreeing on air with the invasion o f Iraq. The suit cites a state law that declares a person canno t be fired for political op inions. Cordonier alleges that some of the Clear Channel officers and d irectors have financial ties with, and are loyal to, President Bush and h is policies. The suit alleges that she was forced to p articipate in a pro-war rally.

Remember this is the c oun try that claims to b e 'liberating' others from tyranny . The Hollywood Reporter told ho w Ed Gernon, the e xecutive produ cer of a mini-series abou t Adolf Hitler, called Hitler: The Rise of Evil, had b een fired b ecause he compared the mood o f Americans to that of the Germans who h elped Hitler rise to po wer.88 He had worked for his produ ction company, Alliance Atlantis, for eleven y ears, but the paper reported that the a ssociation ended when Gernon said in an interview that the rise of Hitler \"basically b oils down to an entire nation g ripped by fear, who ultimately chose to g ive up their civil rights and plunged the whole nation into war\". Gernon added: \"I can't think o f a better time to examine this history than no w.\"B9 The man was right, of course, but what does that matter to the mind- fascists? This is what the Nazi Propaganda Minister, Dr Joseph Goebbels, said abou t suppressing dissent: \"The lie can be maintained on ly for such time a s the State can shield the p eople from the political, econo mic, and /or military c onsequence of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to u se a ll of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth be comes the greatest ene my of the State.\" This is what we see today. Actor Tim Robbins and his actress partner, Susan Sarandon , were a t the forefront of the a nti-war protests in Hollywood, along with p eople like Martin Sheen and Sean Penn. Robb ins talked abou t a \"climate of fear\" for lesser-kno wn actors: \"I know w e're lucky . We ha ve money in the b ank. We h ave careers that support us c ontinuing to work. [But] if I was a mid-range o r supporting a ctor, in this k ind o f environment, it would be a lot scarier for me to risk the progression of my c areer [by c riticising the war]. I know people like that, and they've said than k y ou to me for saying the things that they c an't.\" 90 Actually they can. It's just that they choo se not to b ecause they fear the effect on their careers. What is more important? It was not only, or indeed p rimarily, the rich and famous that face d a backlash for their \"unacce ptable\" views. Armed po lice targeted pub lic protests against the war and o ther demonstrators were arrested for protesting \"without a permit\". Can anyon e give me a n example of anyon e a rrested for backing the slaugh ter withou t a permit? The UK Guardian reported ho w a rightwing 'talk show host' on WABC called Curtis Sliwa c ould h ardly speak for laugh ing when h e took a ca ll from a listener describing what he saw w hile carrying an American flag and y elling suppo rt for the troopS.9! The ca ller said h e had seen a woman carrying a sign saying, \"No blood for oil\". \"She was wearing black and she was an o lder lady\", the ca ller said, \"and then our sheriff saw her and she didn't have a permit. So they pu t her in the back o f the truck car and h auled h er away.\" Oh what a hoo t. Ain't it great to live in the land o f fr eedom? The harassment of those with a different view to that of the Village Idiot are subjected to h arassment and arrest, some people e ven o rdered to leave shop ping malls beca use they were wearing anti-war T-shirts. But it was fine to walk around with b adges s aying, \"Give War a Chance\" and \"First Iraq, then France\", or pathetically rename French fries \"freedom fries\" beca use of the French oppo sition to the mass murder by American and British forces. In Oakland, California, police opened fire with rubber bullets on p eople demonstrating against the war and some 40 were injured, one seriously. David Solnit of Direct Action to Stop the War, a network o f direct action group s, said the police gave a n o rder to d isperse, which was unu sual, and then they didn't give people e nou gh time to leave. \"They fired rubb er bullets, wood en bu llets and b eanbags right into the c rowd\", he said. What kind of world is it when those opposing the slaughter of children are a bused as \"disgusting \" and \"selfish\", as they are in the United States? The Minnesota gov ernor even p ropo sed that arrested activists s hould cover their own law- enforcement costs and o thers were c oncerned, wait for this, that disruptive demonstrations might hamper emergency v ehicles from reaching hospitals and compromise security by distracting po lice forces from terrorist threats!! 92 OK guy s, now don 't forget, you h ave to b reath every few second s, come on, in, out, in, out.

Cicero Illuminati preparation for war always includes the pre-arranged p lan to impose a pupp et leadership after the conflict und er the guise of the 'liberated' people ,\"', gov erning themselves (see Hamid Karsai in Afghanistan). The US and British o ccupation force talked o f J giving the c oun try b ack to Iraqis when that, in true Orwellian style, was the last thing they h ad in mind. War plans also include, agreeing which o f the Illuminati corporations will have the c ontracts to 'rebuild' the target coun try after the same corporations have provided the weapon ry and expertise to d estroy it. The technique takes the Same basic form every time. The man appo inted to control Iraq imm ediately after the war was Lieutenant General Jay Garner, a c lose friend of Cheney and Rumsfeld. He is a staunch and vo cal suppo rter of the Israeli government and o f Jinsa, the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. Garner accepted an all-expenses-paid trip to Israel to say ho w much h e admired the “restraint” of the Israeli army in the Palestinian o ccupied territories. He's ideal to run an Arab coun try, then. Garner was brough t out of retirement in January 2003 to b ecome director of the 'Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance for Iraq'. This was in p reparation for his role in Iraq after the war that we were told was just not inevitable. Garner is president of SY Coleman, the defense firm that specialises in Patriot missiles. It was awarded a contract worth in excess of a billiot1 d ollars for logistics s uppo rt to US Special Forces. It is a subsidiary o f L-3 Communications, a major funder of US political parties. Bush later appointed the former State Department official Paul Bremer, a c lose a ssociate of Rumsfeld, to h ead the American civil service in Iraq with authority even ov er Garner.! His job was to ov ersee the transition to 'democracy', the Bush mobsters said. Bremer served in the Reagan-Bush y ears as 'ambassador-at-large' for coun ter terrorism before joining the notorious 'consulting firm', Kissinger Associates, (see my o ther book s ad . infinitum). Bremer is yet another insider, of course he is, that's why h e got the job. As I was completing this boo k, the Washing ton Post reported that James Baker had b een asked to take overall control of Ir aqi 'reconstruction'.2 This is the same James Baker that was Secretary o f State to father George Bush du ring the 1991 Gulf conflict; t he one who was heavily involved in g etting the unelected boy Bush into the White House; and the major player with father George in the Illuminati subsidiary called the Carlyle Group with its conn ections into the Bin Laden family. President Bush also n amed Reuben Jeffrey III as Washington-based coordinator for Ir aq reconstruction. He is a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs who h ad b een \"coordinating the federal aid aimed to h elp reconstruct lower Manhattan\".3 The Pentagon lawyer, Michael Mobbs, was appo inted to control eleven gov ernment ministries in Iraq. This is the man who wants Americans jailed indefinitely without charge for 'terrorist offences' and h e was the defender of fr eedom who created the \"legal framework\" for the unlimited d etention o f prisoners without charge or trial at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mobb s is a c lose friend o f Richard Perle a nd worked for the law firm of und er secretary at the Defense Department, the neo-con Doug las Feith. Another major player in po st-Saddam Iraq is George Shultz, the Secretary o f State to Reagan-Bush, and advisor to boy George's presidential campaign. He is on ~ board o f Bechtel, a highly sign ificant Illuminati company that built the facilities at Guantanamo Bay and h as won major contracts for the 'reconstruction' of Ir aq. Shultz is chairman o f the International Coun cil of the Illuminati banking op eration, J.P. Morgan Chase (see And The Truth Sha ll Set You Free), in which Lewis Libby, Cheney's Chief of Staff and Project for the New American Century member, has large investments. Morgan Chase lent Saddam's regime $500 milli on in 1 983 - the year Rumsfeld met the Iraqi leader to d iscuss the supp ly o f chemical and biological weapon s. During that visit Rumsfeld apparently spent much o f his s tay n egotiating with Saddam's Ba'ath Party for Shultz's Bechtel to b uild an oil pipeline. Shultz was a member of the Comm ittee for the Liberation o f Ir aq and p atron o f the American Enterprise Institute, home to Iraqi war architects like Richard Pearle a nd 14 members of the Bush cabinet. William Eagleton is another long- time Bush family insider who was wheeled ou t to 'rebuild Iraq'. He went to Yale University, the home of the Skull and Bones Society, with father George Bush. Eagleton was the Chief of US Interests in Iraq b etween 1980 and 1984 - once a gain the time when Rumsfeld arrived to meet with Saddam over the supp ly o f chemical and b iological weapon s. Robert Reilly, the former director of the gov ernment-controlled radio station, Voice of America, was appo inted to create \"Radio Free Iraq\" and b asically take c ontrol of the 'Iraqi' media. He could well be working closely with the former CIA chief, James Woolsey, from the Project for the New A merican Century, who was rumoured to b e lined up for minister of 'education' in Iraq. Reilly is part of the group plann ing a satellite TV station on b ehalf of the US gov ernment to b roadcast propaganda ac ross the Middle East. He is a close friend and bu siness associate of Ahmed Chalabi, the US choice to run the Iraqi gov ernment on their behalf. The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) also suppo rts Chalabi, which is great beca use c learly they h ave the best interests of the Iraqi people a t heart and h ave no h idden agenda, despite their conn ections to so many p eople behind the war. 4 Ahmed \"watch your pockets\" Chalabi Ahmed Chalabi is s upported by Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz, a leading light in Jinsa, and he's been d escribed as \"Cheney's protégé\". This is hardly surprising given that Chalabi is conn ected to the Illuminati American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi comes from an aristocratic Shiite family in Iraq that was conn ected to King Faisal II and the Hashemite monarchy installed by the British when they d rew lines in the sand to create Iraq after the First World War. The Hashemites rule Jordan and claim descent from Hashem, a forebear of the proph et Muhamm ad. The Clean Break document produ ced in 1 996 for former Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, called for Sad d am Hussein to b e removed and replaced with Hashemite royalty, the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 121 ruling bloodline of Jordan. One of Chalabi's relatives, Fadhil Chalabi, was invo lved in the oil indu stry for more than 30 y ears and was Deputy Secretary o f the Organisation o f Petroleum Exporting Coun tries (OPEC) and Under Secretary o f Oil at the Iraqi Ministry o f Petroleum. Chalabi's family fled to Hashemite-ruled Jordan when the British-imposed Iraqi 'monarchy' was overthrown in 19 58 an ~ beca me an extremely wealthy b anker there before he was found g uilty in his absence by a military court in 19 89 o f a massive fraud. He was sentenced to 22 y ears, but it appears that he fled in the boo t (trunk) of a c ar with $20 milli on. The fraud led to the c ollapse of the Jordanian b ank h e directed, Petra Bank, and the gov ernment had-to p ayou t $200 milli on to depositors who faced the loss of their savings. The INC (CIA) Chalabi founded the Iraqi National Cong ress (INC) in 19 92 at a meeting o f exiles held in Vienna, Austria, and James Woolsey, the Director of the CIA and member of the Project for the New A merican Century, beca me Chalabi's champion. He settled in London as leader of the INC that was fund ed by the CIA to the tune of $32 5,000 a month and h e a pparently rece ived some $12 milli on from the US after the 1991 Gulf conflict. It was from Chalabi and the Iraqi National Cong ress that much bogu s \"intelligence\" originated; this was used by Bush and Blair to \"prove\" the Saddam threat. Chalabi often visited Israel when h e was with the Petra Bank and beca me friendly with the late Albert Wohlstetter, whom he first met while a student at the University o f Chicago - also attended by Zalmay Khalilzad, the Bush 'special envoy ' to Afghanistan and Iraq. Wohlstetter was an inspiration for the so-called n eoconservative movement in the United States and, through him; Chalabi met ... Richard Perle. Yes, the Pentagon advisor at the forefront of promoting war in Iraq. At the time Perle was Under-Secretary o f Defense for international-security p olicy to Reagan-Bush. Today, Perle backs Chalabi to lead Iraq even though h e hasn't lived there since 1958 . According to a Glasgow Sunday Herald report, Perle's Jinsa a ssociate, Deputy Defense Secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, wants other members of the Iraqi National [CIA] Cong ress involved in the US pupp et gov ernment. These include Chalabi's nephew Salem Chalabi, Aras Habib and Dr Ali Yassin Karim, Habib's cousin, a former medic with the CIA, who was retained by the a gency d espite threats of dismissal after the intervention o f former CIA D irector, James Woolsey, the member of Jinsa a nd the Project for the New A merican Century. Chalabi's friends, Tamara Daghestani and Goran Talebani, are two others on the Wolfowitz list of US front men in the new gov ernment of 'free' Iraq.5 Chalabi was named by the Americans on a 25strong 'coun cil' to 'advise' the US occupiers. The Iraqis have not turned ou t to b e a s stupid as the neo-cons would like to b elieve, however, and the campaign to stop Chalabi and the INC taking control has been mobilised to scupp er the plan. Returning \"home\"? On Tuesday, April 15th 2003, Jay Garner and Zalmay Khalilzad ho sted a meeting o f Ir aqi groups in the shadow of the 4,000-year-old ziggurat at Ur. Ziggu rats are the step-pyramid temples of the a ncient Sumerians. Those who h ave read my book s like The Biggest Secret and Children o f the Matrix will und erstand the deep significance of this for the symbolism-obsessed Illuminati who trace their bloodlines back to Babylon and Sumer in what is now Iraq. I will add to this s ignificance in the next chapter. Ur is also the a lleged h ome of Abraham, the man claimed to h ave found ed Judaism and to b e a n ancestor to bo th Jews and Arabs. What he is not, of course, is an ancestor of the Ashkenazi/Khazars. Garner, who h ad just turned 65 , said: \"What better birthday can a man h ave than to b egin it not only where c ivilization b egan bu t where a free Iraq and a democratic Iraq will begin today?\" 6 I am not sure I would pu t it that way myself. Zalmay Khalilzad assured the delegates that the United States had \"no interest, absolutely no interest, in ruling Iraq\". He a dded: \"We want you to establish y our own d emocratic system based on Iraqi traditions and v alues.\"? If he had b een like that other pupp et, Pinocchio, his nose would h ave imm ediately stretched from Baghd ad to Washington. Mind y ou, it's probably that length, and more, most of the time. This meeting was s uppo sed to b e the start of the process of establishing a new Iraqi-controlled 'democratic' gov ernment, but that is s imply no t go ing to happen. The American-British (Illuminati) agenda is to control the Middle East, not give it back to the people. A front regime will be c reated do minated by US place men and they will continue to control the oil and the c oun try and establish p ermanent military b ases from which they will launch their further expansion and control of the region in consort with Israel. Any Iraqi oppo sition to this US dictatorship, and it has already b egun , will be dismissed as agitation manipulated by Iran o r \"Saddam sympathisers\" to undermine the new \"free\" Iraq, thus offering the excuse to target Iran. The CIA and British intelligence have a long record o f manipulating the internal affairs of Iran and there is no way that the student protests against the Iranian gov ernment have not been \"encouraged\" by those sources to suppo rt their plans for occupation. As for Syria, I think you are going to b e having some American tourists at some point and they won't be bearing gifts. Guided missiles, maybe, but not gifts! Snorting in the pig trough The Illuminati strategy in their manipu lated wars is to u se their armament companies to supp ly the weapon s to destroy a c oun try (paid for by the taxpayers and loans from Illuminati banks) and then u se their construction and o ther companies to rebuild it (paid for by the taxpayer and loans from Illuminati banks). This tax money from the people is funn elled through many sources, includ ing 'aid' from national governments, the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and charities fund ed by support from the same taxpayers. The Illuminati work to control government aid agencies; they control- indeed create many 'charities'; and, as I have detailed in p revious books, they set up the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The latter is currently h eaded by James Wolfensohn , a c lose business associate of the deeply Illuminati House of Rothschild banking empire that uses Jewish p eople a s pawns in its horrific game. What a surprise that within d ays of American troop s entering Baghd ad we had Bush calling for the e nding o f sanctions (imposed through the United Nations by the United States and United Kingdom) that had cost the lives of around a million Iraqi children since 1991 . We're here now, we don 't want sanctions once we're in control, and we've got money to make. The US gov ernment also called on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suppo rt"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 122 the reconstruction o f Ir aq and for coun tries to write off I raqi debts.

Knock 'em down ... The 'defence' companies that made multi-multi billi ons s upp lying the weapon s to d evastate Iraq and its people were all Illuminati controlled. The Defense Policy Board at the Pentagon is the major route to winning such contracts. It was headed by Richard Perle, the Jinsa member of the far-right American Enterprise Institute a nd Project for the New A merican Century, until he was forced to resign ov er conflicts of interest. He remains on the board. Another eight of his fellow board members have c onn ections to companies that won contracts from the Pentagon , among them Northrop Grumm an, Bechtel and the Rand Corporation (former employees, Lewis Libby and Zalmay Khalilzad). Defense Policy Board members include General Jack Sheehan (conn ected to Bechtel), former CIA chief, James Woolsey and former Repub lican Secretary o f Defense James Schlesinger. Northrop Grumm an won contracts worth $8 .5 b illion in 2 002. This is conn ected to Jinsa a nd the American Enterprise Institute with its 14 members of the Bush cabinet. Another beneficiary o f war and the fantastic increases in military spending by Bush, is SY Coleman, headed by ... yes, yes ... Jay Gamer, the man appo inted by Bush to 'lead' Iraq after the war. James Woolsey comes up o ften, as you will have noted, and h e has been a director of DynCorp, a 'security' organisation that operates wherever the United States choo ses to 'liberate'.10 DynCorp, which won a multi-milli on d ollar contract to run the Iraqi police force, is a major donor to Bush's Repub lican Party and its personn el in Bosnia boug ht and sold girls as young as twelve a nd v ideotaped the rape of a woman. They ran a brothel and competed to see who could o wn the you ngest girl. The c ompany was forced to p ay more than $150 ,000 in compensation to Kathryn Bolkovac, a former UN International Police Force monitor und er contract to DynCorp, who was fired for blowing the whistle on their sex ring. Another DynCorp employee, Ben John ston, who also expo sed the scandal, was dismissed and taken into p rotective custody by the United States Army Criminal Investigation Unit until they could g et him safely ou t of the coun try. John ston filed a lawsuit, which said: \"In the latter part of 1999 Johnston learned that employees and supervisors from DynCorp were e ngaging in perverse, illega l and inhumane b ehaviour [and] were purchasing illegal weapons, women, forged pa ssports and [participating in] other imm oral acts. John ston witnessed co-workers and supervisors literally buying and selling women for their own personal enjoyment and e mployees would brag ab out the various age s and talents of the individual slaves they had purchased.\" 12 John son also reported that drinking on the job [while repairing milit ary aircraft!], fraud and complete incompetence were \"de rigueur\" (the rule, not the e xception) at DynCorp. This is the 0peration that has been contracted to o perate the Iraqi police force. DynCorp was among a few companies \"quietly invited\" to bid for the c ontract. A State Department official called the process\" a limited competition\" that was born o f urgency. David Isenberg, a senior analyst in the Washington office of the British American Security Information Coun cil, said: \"Since you already h ave a popu lation in Iraq that is high ly suspicious of us and ou r motives, do you really want someone with DynCorp's baggage doing this s ort of work there?\"13 Actually, it's just the kind of company a Bush administration would want, I would h ave thought. Since 199 6, DynCorp's contract for the Balkans has been expanded to include police-training and advisory missions in East Timor and Afghanistan and this has earned some $300 milli on.14 A group o f Ecuadorean p easants filed a c lass action against the c ompany alleging that herbicides s pread by DynCorp in Colombia were drifting across the border, killing crops, causing illness and k illing children. When we are talking abou t 'defense' contractors and Illuminati companies that make billions from gov ernment contracts, we must never forget the Carlyle Group, much loved by the Bin Laden family, and h eaded by former CIA number two, Frank Carlucci, and p eople like father George Bush and h is Secretary o f State at the time of the Gulf War, James Baker, who h as been asked by boy Bush to h ead 'reconstruction' in Iraq. Carlyle c hairman Carlucci is on the Board o f Trustees of the Illuminati Rand Corporation and co-chair of the Rand Center for Midd le East Public Policy Advisory Board. Carlucci and James Baker are c lose friends and associates of the current US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Baker was a c lassmate of Rumsfeld at Yale University and Carlucci was Rumsfeld's roomm ate a t Yale. 15 Secretary o f State Colin Powell has also d escribed Carlucci as his \"mentor\". Carlucci admits that in February 20 01 h e met with Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney to talk abou t military p olicy. This was at a time when Carlyle had several defense projects worth b illi ons of dollars und er consideration. How hilarious, therefore, are the c omm ents of Carlucci when h e said: 'I've made it clear that I don 't lobby the defense indu stry. I will give our Carlyle bankers advice on what they might do and whom they should talk to. But I do no t pick up the phone a nd say you shou ld fund X, Y or Z.\" 16 Then there a re the claims of David Rubenstein, one of Carlyle's found ers and a former aide to the Jimm y Carter administration, that was served at the CIA by Carlucci. Rubenstein said: \"Mr [f ather George] Bush g ives us no advice on what to do with the federal gov ernment. We've gon e over backwards to make sure that we do no lobby ing.\" lC So funny . But even funnier was this claim by Daniel A. D' Aniello, a Carlyle managing director: \"We a re greatly assisted by Baker and Bush ... [because] ... it shows that we a re associated with p eople of the highest ethical standards. \"That's abou t as wrong as any sentence has ever been in all human history. Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity, hit t he button when h e said: \"Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration a s they c an po ssibly be. [Father] Bush is getting mone y from private interests that have bu siness before the go vernment, while h is s on is president. And, in a really peculiar way, George W. Bush could, some da y [some da y??] benefit financially from his own"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 123 administration's decisions, through h is father's investments. The average American doesn't know that and , to me, that's a jaw-dropper.\" 18 ... a nd build 'em up As always, having fleece d the people to fund their war on Iraq, the Illuminati fleece d the people still further for 'Iraqi reconstruction'. USAID is the gov ernment agency h anding ou t the c ontracts to rebuild the c oun try after the US bombing d estroyed it and the Iraqi people had no say in this at all. Only American companies conn ected to Bush and h is masters need h ave a ny though ts of winning a c ontract. There was no b idding p rocess even among US companies; a few w ere \"invited to apply\". International Resources Group o f Washington DC which won a $70 milli on contract for 'humanitarian aid', has four vice-presidents who h eld top po sts with USAID and half the c ompany's technical staff worked for the agency. USAID is headed by Andrew N atsios, who was chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority du ring the infamous and record-breaking cost overrun for a three-mile road tunn el in Boston k nown as the 'Big Dig'. The project was cost out at $3.5 b illion in 1985, but went on to d evou r $23 billi on. The beneficiary o f this was George Shultz's Bechtel. And h ey, who got a fantastic c ontract to reconstruct Iraq? Well, well - Bechtel. The c ontract is worth the best of a billion dollars and, with an estimated $1 00 billion to b e spent, this will be just the start. George Shultz, the former Reagan-Bush Secretary o f State; Casper Weinberger, the former Reagan-Bush Defense Secretary who was charged ov er Iran Contra drugs or arms scandal and p ardon ed by father Bush; and General Jack Sheehan o f the Pentagon 's Defense Policy Board, will be delighted. All are with Bechtel, a major funder of Bush's Repub lican Party. Shultz was boy George's presidential campaign advisor. Riley Bechtel, the c hairman and chief executive officer of the Bechtel Group, is even a member of the Bush Administration with his position on the Export Coun cil. Bechtel's contract is for infrastructure repair work on po wer generation facilities, electrical grids, municipal water systems, sewage systems, airport facilities, the dredging, repair and u pgrading o f the Umm Qasr seaport, and includes a possible role in repair and reconstruction o f hospitals, schools, selected gov ernment ministry b uildings, irrigation facilities and transportation links, all of which were destroyed by the bombs of the Illuminati armament companies. Bechtel has a long history o f work in Iraq, not least und er the rule of Rumsfeld's old friend, Saddam Hussein. Tom Hash, the President of Bechtel National, said: \"Bechtel is hono red to h ave been selected, through a c ompetitive process, by US AID to h elp b ring humanitarian assistance, econo mic recovery and infrastructure to h elp the Iraqi people,\" 19 I love The Bin Bechtels Bechtel, like the B\\1sh family, has very close c onn ections with the Bin Ladens, as revealed by the New Yorker magazine. 20 it said that Osama bin Laden's extraordinarily wealthy construction empire in Saudi Arabia is a substantial investor with a $10 milli on stake in a private e quity firm called the Fremont Group, founded by Bechtel. Both are based in San Francisco. It was a Bechtel subsidiary until 1986 and, as the Fremont website says, it still \"enjoys a c lose relationship with Bechtel\". It is, in fact, rather more than that. A Fremont spok esman confirmed to the New Yorker that the majority o wnership is in the hands of the Bechtel family. Five of Fremont's eight directors are also d irectors of Bechtel and on e of them, Riley Bechtel, is the c hairman and chief executive officer of the Bechtel Group . George Shultz is a director both o f Fremont and the Bechtel Group, where he was once president. Rick Kopf, the general coun sel of the Fremont Group, which manages some e leven b illi on d ollars in assets, confirms that the Bin Laden family invested abou t ten milli on d ollars in one' of Fremont's private fund s before September 11th. He said the Bin Laden family h as not enlarged its s take since then, but declined to discuss further the a ssociation o f the c ompany to the Bin Ladens, He a lso chose not to d iscuss the origin o r the nature of the relationship b etween the Bin Laden and Bechtel families, both o f which have made fortunes in hug e c onstruction p rojects in Arab coun tries. Kopf said: \"Ow nership is private a nd is not disclosed.\" 21 What a stink would ensue if the ownership o f these organisations were revealed. Companies awarded massive c ontracts paid for by pu blic money shou ld no t und er any circumstances be allowed to k eep their ownership secret. The secrecy no t only makes corruption po ssible, it ensures it. Root of corrup tion Halliburton is the biggest oil services company in the world, thanks to a c onsiderable e xtent to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was CEO from 1993 to 2000 when h e left to join the Bush campaign. He was given a $34 milli on 'retirement' package when h e left to nu rse maid George W. Bush and remains on the payroll. Halliburton was engaged through its major subsidiary, Kellogg Brown and Root, to extinguish the oil well fires in Iraq (no d oubt ignited by US S pecial Forces) and repair oil facilities at a reported cost of some seven b illion dollars, although the c ontract does not specify a time or cost limit. The c ompany was awarded the contract by the Army Corps of Engineers und er federal laws that allow negotiations to b e c ondu cted in secret and withou t competition b eca use of national security. But it later emerged that the contract involved rather more than just putting ou t oil fires. It gave Cheney's Halliburton the power to control all phases of Iraq's oil industry.:' Henry Waxman, a Democrat representative for California, said h e had rece ived a letter fr om the Army on May 2nd 2003 confirming that the Halliburton contract can include 'operation' of Ir aqi oil fields and 'distribution' of Ir aqi oil. Officials had p reviously said the c ontract dealt only with p utting out oil well fires and p erforming emergency repairs as needed. This was the oil, you reca ll, that was going to b e c ontrolled by the Iraqis in the pre-war propaganda from the White House a nd Downing Street. Waxman said in a letter to the Army on May 6th 20 03 : \"These n ew disclosures are significant, and ty s eem at odd s with the [Bush] administration's repeated assurances that the Iraqi oil belongs to the Iraqi people.\" 2' Kellogg Brown and Root is nothing to do with b reakfast cereal and everything to do with d rug runn ing, arms dealing and go rging on gov ernment contracts. I have highlighted the background to this company in Alice in Wonderland an d the World Trade Center Disaster. It is a major subsidiary o f Halliburton, which h as a"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 124 worldwide operation invo lving 130 countries and is America's biggest non -union company. While Cheney was Defense Secretary (and b efore and afterwards), Brown and Root has been awarded hund reds of millions of dollars' worth o f construction contracts in war zones like Bosnia, Somalia a nd Haiti after they h ad b een devastated by US bombing and manipulation. Halliburton h as worked closely with some of the most appalling terrorist dictatorships on the planet. Cheney talks of \"constructive e ngagement\" in which you work with such regimes and p ass on American v alues. No n eed. The values of successive American and British gov ernments are a mirror of those e mployed by these very terrorist dictatorships. For Cheney, this is nothing to do with \"values\" - he doesn't have a ny - it is abou t working with anyon e a t any p rice to ensure more money and po wer, and the a dvancement of the Illuminati agenda. Halliburton h ad conn ections to Permindex, a British intelligence front organisation h eaded by the Canadian Louis M. Bloomfield, which, it is now w ell documented, was a central coordinating n etwork b ehind the a ssassination o f President Kennedy in Dallas in 1 963. (See a lso And the Truth S hall Set You Free for the detailed b ackground.) Permindex o rganised d eath squads in Europe, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and the United States. This is the way the Illuminati families and agents operate. They control the gov ernment decisions through the Illuminati one-party state a nd op erate companies, like Halliburton and the Carlyle Group, which b enefit from those gov ernment decisions and policies. This is how, once Cheney took ov er, Halliburton was able to expand so rapidly and b ecome the fifth largest defense contractor in the United States, so b enefiting enormously from conflicts like the 'war on terrorism'. Cheney was the Defense Secretary in the Gulf conflict suppo sedly aimed at Sad d am Hussein in 1991 . Yet he made big p rofits for himself and Halliburton after 1998 through d eals with ... Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The London Fina ncial Times reported that Cheney ov ersaw $23 .8 million worth o f contracts for the sale of 'oil industry' techno logy and services to Iraq. He used Halliburton subsidiaries in France, Italy, Germany and Austria to h ide the Cheney-Halliburton conn ection. Among these c ompanies were Dresser Rand and Ingersoll- Dresser Pump.25 These contracts together were worth more then any o ther US company d oing bu siness with Iraq. The Interna tiona l Herald Tribune reported that \"Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll Dresser Pump Co .... have don e work in Iraq on contracts for the reconstruction o f Ir aq's oil industry, und er the United Nations:' Oil for food Program\".26 A H alliburton spok esman admitted in the Tribune article that the Dresser subsidiaries had sold oil pumping equipment to Iraq via their European agents. So g et this: these c ontracts for Cheney's Halliburton g roup were helping to rebuild the oil infrastructure of Iraq d estroyed by the bombs dropp ed by United States planes comm anded from the Pentagon by the then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Now they are at it again after the Bush-Cheney administration re-bombed Iraq in 2003 ! While making money from Iraq for Halliburton, Cheney supported sanctions against Iraq that produ ced around a million d ead children (so what happened to \"constructive e ngagement\"?) Since the second Iraqi conflict his company is winning more contracts from the same US gov ernment, of which h e is Vice President. You could not make this up. Halliburton h as also struck d eals in Iran and Libya, even though they were on the State Department's list of terrorist states. The Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root was fined $3 .8 million for violation o f US sanctions against Libya. In 200 2, they also agreed to p ay the US gov ernment $2 milli on to settle c laims that while Cheney was in charge it defrauded the military. This involved a lawsuit alleging the c ompany made false claims and statements in 2 24 d elivery o rders between April 19.94 and September 1998. This pay-off to avoid the c ourts has happened on six o ther: occa sions. Cheney h as been the biggest shareholder in Halliburton with a stake of some'$45 .5 million and the c ompany's board includes Lawrence Eagleburger, who h eld State Department posts und er President Father George a nd is an executive of the infamous Kissinger Associates (see And The Truth Sh all Set You Free). Paul Bremer, who was appo inted to h ead the American civil service in Iraq, is a former executive with Kissinger Associates. Paying for the privilege Halliburton and Brown and Root have long u sed p olitical patronage a nd funding to expand business and p rofits. Brown and Root's ticket to the top came through its po litical contributions to President Lynd on John son from the time he ran for Senate in 1948 . The Austin Chron icle once ca lled him \"the ca ndidate from Brown and Root\".2 ~ Thanks to John son they made billions on gov ernment contracts, including those relating to the Vietnam War after John son reversed the policies of the assassinated JFK and p lunged America deeper into the conflict. During Vietnam, John son g ave his personal fund ers contracts for airports, pipelines and military bases. 28 According to biographer Ronnie Dugg er, author of The Politi cian: The Life and Times of Lyndon Johnson,29 much o f the money h e was paid by Brown and Root came in cash. \"It was a totally corrupt relationship and it benefited both o f them enormously\", says Dugg er, \"Brown and Root got rich, and John son got power and riches.\" Using the same tactics, the c ontracts have flowed from gov ernment ever since. Michael C. Rupp ert, a former Los Angeles police narcotics officer, wrote in a study o f Brown and Root: \"From Bosnia and Kosovo, to Chechnya. to Rwanda, to Burma, to Pakistan, to Lao s, to Vietnam, to Indonesia, to Iran to L ibya to Mexico to Colombia, Brown & Root's traditional operations have expanded from heavy c onstruction to include the provision of logistical support for the U.S. military. Now, instead of U.S. Army quartermaster ~ -tf1e world is likely to see Brown & Root warehouses s toring and managing everything from uniforms to rations to vehicles.\" 30 In Alice in Wonderland a nd the World Trade Center Disaster, I expo se the a ppalling b ackground to Halliburton/Brown and Root. This includes the drug and arms running activities that have been h ighlighted from personal experience by Mike Rupp ert (see his website a t http://www .fromthewildemess.com). The Illuminati control the global drug running n etwork and it was no surprise when the Pakistan Interior Minister, Makhdo om Faisal Saleh Hayat, said the poppy cultivation for the produ ction o f op ium and h eroin h as risen to record levels in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, but US-led coalition forces were doing nothing to address the problem. He said: \"Two-thirds of that is on o ur western borders. We h ave a sked the Americans, we told the commanders of allied forces - what hampers y ou, or what restricts y ou from totally neutralising this c ultivated land? They s ay that is not within our mandate. Now, when we are told such things, it certainly is s omething which is hard to d igest.\" 31 "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 125 Not so h ard to und erstand, thou gh, when y ou realise that the force behind the invasion o f Afghanistan controls the global drugs market (see Alice in Wonderland a nd the World Trade Center Disaster and The Biggest Secret for the drug conn ections to the Bush family and the present US administration). Increasing the Afghanistan o pium supply from the world's biggest source was all part of the invasion plan. More snort, snorts A company that works closely with Halliburton is the Parsons Corporation. It has don ated $152 ,000 to Bush's Repub lican Party and h as helped to 'reconstruct' Kosovo and Bosnia a fter American and British bo mbers went to work. Elaine Chao, the US Labou r Secretary, was on the Parsons board b efore joining the Bush gov ernment. Parsons is in line for 'reconstruction' contracts in Iraq worth $900 million. Lucent Techno logies, Qualcomm and others have been n amed in relation to the one billion do llars on o ffer to replace Iraq's telecomm unications and that will please the Pentagon und er-secretary, Douglas J .

Feith h as around h alf a million d ollars invested in Lucent and Libby is a shareholder at Qualcomm . Libby also has s hares in another company, Raytheon Corp, which h as apparently b een selected with Kellogg Brown and Root to d estroy 'weapon s of mass destruction'. Not much money in that though, eh? One of the first USAID contracts went to the union breaking Stevedore Services of America to 'manage' the Umm Qasr Port on Iraq's Gulf Coast, which was taken early in the c onflict. Its president, John Hemingway, makes contributions to the Repub lican Party and the c ontract angered the British government and army. (You don 't coun t guy s, you 're just there to send in the British troop fodd er, so g et used to it). Robin Cook, which signed from the Blair gov ernment in p rotest at the war, comm ented: \"The d ispute over the management of the port of Umm Qasr is a go od e xample. British o fficers s ensibly took the view that the best and the most popu lar solution would be to find local Iraqis who knew how to do it. Instead the US has appo inted an American company to take over the Iraqi asset. And g uess what? Stevedore Services of America who go t the contract have a chairman known for his donations to the Republican Party.\" 33 While a ll this was going on in Iraq, American companies were being fined (very q uietly and virtually unreported in the media) und er the Trading with the Enemy Act for doing bu siness with 'terrorist regimes' named by the US gov ernment, including Iraq, Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Sudan. Fifty-seven companies were involved and among them were Citigroup, Wal-Mart, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco, with conn ections to the Bushes, Cheney and Cond oleezza Rice. ChevronTexaco was charged for trading with Iraq. The biggest fine, a quarter of a million d ollars, was imposed up on Zim American Israeli Shipp ing Co. of Norfolk, Virginia., which is half owned by the Israeli gov ernment. This company relocated from the 16th floor of the World Trade Center just a week b efore the September 11th attack. What liberation really mea ns May 1 st is a major day in the Illuminati Satanic ritual calendar in the period called Beltane. It was no coincidence that this was the day when George Bush d eclared 'victory' in Iraq. The Vietnam draft-dodg er appeared on the a ircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, off the California c oast to u se returning troops as his s tage prop. Tony Blair, ritually elected on May 1 st 1997 , also spoke of 'victory'. But what was this 'victory'? And 'victory' for whom? With the main conflict completed, this is what the people, who h ad b een 'liberated', were left with: A brutal dictator was no longer in charge in Iraq, but a new one was, thinly disguised as a 'liberator'. Tens of thou sands of civilian men, women and children were dead o r maimed, along with tens of thou sands of conscripts who h ad no wish to fight anyon e. Thou sands of children were now orphans. One little boy, Ali, had no p arents, no arms and a horrendou sly burned bo dy b eca use of CS and British b ombing and there were coun tless others who h a\\'e suffered similar horrors. US and British troop s were killed and injured taking over a c oun try for the Illuminati, who see them as \"dumb, stupid animals to b e used as pawns for foreign policy\". Soldiers in Iraq h ave died regularly ever since. Electricity and water supp lies were cut off across the coun try, including those to ho spitals deluged with casualties. Most hospitals were c losed b eca use of the bombing and the danger for staff of travelling to work, and this when un told thou sands needed u rgent treatment. Iraq's financial system was destroyed by the bombing and the orchestrated looting o f banks, thus opening the way for a new U S-imposed system. Iraqis lost their life sayings, jobs and income. Others who spent their lives building their businesses and ho mes have had them looted in the c haos that has followed 'liberation'. Depleted u ranium and cluster bombs have been left by the US and British air forces and will cause untold suffering in explosions, leukaemia a nd d eformed b irths. Museums containing some of the world's most priceless historical artefacts have been looted and bu rned and the most important it ems will end up in the United States, some to b e used in the human sacrifice rituals of these sick p eople who trace their blood lines back to the land o f Sumer and Babylon that is now Iraq. The United States oil cartel, through Cheney's Halliburton, has control of the Iraqi oil, the second biggest reserves in the world. The US multinationals have control of Ir aqi government administration, indu stry and commerce. The US has the foothold in the Gulf region that was planned in the Project for the New A merican Century do cument for the Bush g ang b efore he was illegally place d in po wer. Israel is also d elighted with the outcome. The United States are planning to choo se a pupp et to take Over the 'civilian g overnment' and to maintain p ermanent military b ases in Iraq to ensure that everything is run their way and the Illuminati that controls the American and British governments plan to u se those c oun tries for further mass murder in the Middle East and further a field. So what was this victory in Iraq? It was victory for the Illuminati agenda for a global fascist dictatorship; victory for the real perpetrators of 9/11 . Baiting for God No expo sure of the Illuminati techniques of mass manipulation would b e c omplete without a mention o f religion.

What is happening now w ith the focus on Islam is but the latest example.

Boy Graham wants to 'save' the Iraqis from their Islamic faith, which h e ca lls \"evil and wicked ... \"34 With Graham rubbing bibles with p eople like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson (see Children o f the Matrix), I bow to h is s uperior talent for bigotry on such matters. Graham is a c lose friend o f Bush and family and d elivered the invocation at the idiot president's illegal inauguration in 2 001. Journalist Steven Waldman wrote: \"I am not sure a ny o f this means that America's foreign p olicy ob jectives are served by h aving a Bush-loving, Islam-bashing, Muslim-converting Christian icon on the ground in Iraq tending to the bodies and souls of the grateful but deeply suspicious Muslim population. Or, to pu t it more simply, the idea is absolutely loopy .\" 3; Well, un less you see the a genda it is. Boy Graham was asked to d eliver a Good Friday sermon at the Pentagon to the outrage of the Defense Department's Muslim employees and und er Bush's 'Faith Based Initiative', Graham's 'Samaritan's Purse' organisation stands to receive US gov ernment (taxpayer) f und s for its extreme form of Christian fund amentalism in Iraq. All the c orruption and manipulation revealed in the last few chapters are c onn ected to the same end: destroying Islam, a unifying force for the Arab p eople they wish to conquer; a ~ imposing their permanent control of government, milit ary, banking, business, media a nd 'education' in the target coun tries. This is the blueprint to b e used with all the nations that the Illuminati - via the British and American gov ernments - intend to absorb into their global empire. The Christian b elief-system is at the-heart of so much manipulation o f the American collective mind. After appearing on a North American radio show to expo se the a genda a nd quo ting much o f the information in these last few, chapters, I received an email from a listener. She said I was suffering from \"extreme paranoia\". \"Instead o f focussing on on e malevolent group such as the Illuminati how abou t studying the Scriptures, which teac h abou t the e nd times, and all that it will mean for us; and g etting your heart right with God by acce pting his gift of salvation?\" She said she was angry that I could sugg est that9/11 was s taged o r allowed to o ccur: \"I trust the p resent Administration - more than an y other Administration that I have seen in the US.

The a lleged \"Christianity\" of these people is merely v oiced to fool the voters beca use they kno w that anyon e who do es not pledge a llegiance to that faith will have no chance of becoming p resident. I mean Clinton said it for goo dness sake. And Blair also claims to b e a dedicated Christian b eliever. Tom Foley, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, said: \"We a re no t a nation that prays in its c loset. We e xpect the p resident to be o ur principal preacher, to e xpress constantly the idea that God has s howered u s with special blessings, and that we, therefore, have a special iden tity, a special mission in the world. It is a mission which is realised in part just by being who we are, but which a lso requires us to en courage o thers to be just like u s.\" 36 What chilling words they are. Here we have yet another nation b elieving they are the c hosen p eople of 'God', with n ot only the right, but the \"mission\", to impose, sorry \"encourage\", others to b e like them. The massive irony is, however, that America is not gov erned by Christians at all. In a powerful article headed \"Bush's 'Christian' Blood Cult\", the Washington investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, rightly p oints out: \", .. Bush and fellow self-anointed n eo-Christians like House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, John Ashcroft, and sports arena Book of Revelations c arnival hawker Franklin Graham appear to wallow in a 'Christian' blood lust cult when it comes to p racticing the teachings of the founder of Christianity.\" 37 As we shall see, however, when you realise what the \"Christian\" religion is really b ased upon , the term \"blood lust cult\" becomes perfectly appropriate. While he was Governor of Texas, Bush sanctioned a record 152 executions, 40 o f them in the year 2000 as he ran for election as president. One of the Texas execution 'team', Fred Allen, quit in disgust at the number of lethal injections he had to p repare, according to the Washington Post. 38 Madsen says that he was told by a former Texas Department of Public Safety o fficer, a devou t Roman Catholic, that Bush was more than h appy to ignore DNA data a nd do cumented cases of miscondu ct by the prosecution, to send innocent people to the lethal injection chamber at Huntsville. The officer said the number of executed mentally retarded, African Americans, and those who committed capital crimes as minors, was proof that Bush was insensitive a nd a \"phon ey Christian\". Of course he is; they all are. Among Bush's victims as gov ernor was 'fellow' born-again Christian, Karla Faye Tucker, who led a prison ministry after being convicted o f murder. When she a sked for clemency, Bush rejected appeals from the Pope a nd the World Coun cil of Churches and just mocked h er. In an interview w ith Talk magazine, Bush imitated Tucker's appeal for him to spare her life - pursing his lips, squinting his eyes, and in a squeaky vo ice, saying, \"Please don 't kill me\". Former Republican p residential candidate Gary Bauer, an evangelical Christian, said: \"I think it is nothing short of unb elievable that the gov ernor of a major state runn ing for president though t it was acceptable to mock a woman h e decided to pu t to d eath,\" 3Y U nless you really k now the Bush family, that is. I will explain in the next few chapters why these people ca n act so callously with no regard for life or suffering. They do no t feel emotion the way most of the pop ulation do es and there are reasons for this. They are involved in a blood cult long expo sed in my o ther book s, but it certainly isn't \"Christian\" in the way that word is perceived. The term 'God' is just another tool used by Bush speec hwriters to scam the American mind. Wayne Madsen writes: \"Bush ha s not once prayed for the innocent civilians who d ied a s a result of the US attack on Iraq. He constantly 'embeds' himself with the military at Goebbels-like speech fests and makes c onstant references to"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 127 God when he refers to America's 'victory' in Iraq, as if God e ndorses his s ordid killing spree. He makes no mention o f the children, women, and o ld men killed b y America's 'precision-guided' missiles and bo mbs and trigger-happy US troops. In fact, Bush revels in indiscriminate b lood letting. Since he n ever experienced such killing in Southeast Asia, when he was AWOL from his Texas Air National Guard un it, Bush just doe s not seem to un derstand the h orror of a parent watching one's c hildren h aving their heads and limbs blown o ff in a sudden blast of shrapnel or children witnessing their parents burning to d eath with their own body fat nurturing the flames.\" 40 This is a man who targeted the Christian vo te in a presidential 'debate' by saying Jesus was his favou rite philosopher. Or maybe that's the only one he's ever heard o f. The real George Bush, the 'Christian b eliever' in whom so many pu t their faith, was eloqu ently d escribed by Madsen: \"Bush, who fancies himself a 'born-again' Christian, is actually a foul-mouthed a nd e rratic alcoho lic. For example, the 'pretzel' incident had no thing to do with a pretzel. While watching a football game a t the White House, the 'leader of the free world' got so d runk he fell right on h is face and b lamed it on h is inab ility to remember his mother's missive about chewing a ll one's food b efore swallowing. Such a libis and ruses are the trademarks of drunks. During the presidential campaign Bush called a New York Times reporter a 'major league asshole.' In 1986 , a clearly drunk and d isorderly Bush told The Wall Street Journal's AI Hunt, 'You fucking son of a b itch ... I saw what you wrote. We're not going to forget this'. The rich frat boy was irate about an a rticle Hunt wrote ab out Bush's father. Time magazine is reporting that during a March 2 002 briefing for three sena tors by Condoleezza Rice, Bush po ked h is head into a White House meeting room and be llowed, 'Fuck Saddam. We're taking h im out!''' 41 Christianity is massively manipu lated by the Illuminati. In fact, as I have indicated, Christianity is one of the greatest forces of control in the United States and that makes wars against Muslims, Asians and Chinese so much easier to sell. Gentle Jesus wants us to k ill those who do no t believe in him as their saviour and h e wants to subsidise Jewish settlements on Palestinian land in Israel, as many fund amentalist cong regations do. Typical of the hypo crisy that equates\" gentle Jesus\" with mass murder, came from Captain Jimmy Nicho ls, the battalion chaplain for 2-504 Parachute Infantry Regiment, who h eld a c hurch service for US infantrymen in Afghanistan in which the key hy mn was \"Keep on the Firing Line\". Dressed in full combat gear, he launched into a sermon abou t Samson who, he said, was the \"original tough guy, long b efore Rambo\", whose \"super-strength\" was a gift from God. He a dded that God h ad g iven them gifts also. \"You see, the reason that Samson is s uch a good story for folks like you and me in the military is that Samson is you, Samson is me.\" 42 What a prat. As someone once said, the Christian world would b e so much n icer if only more Christians were like their Christ. Reich thinking Pro-Bush, pro-war, America is a deeply sick society. It is mentally and emotionally disturbed and mind- controlled to zombie propo rtions. How can it give freedom to anyon e when it does not have freedom itself? Not even freedom of thou ght. A K night Ridder poll in May 20 03 claimed that a third o f the American pu blic believes US forces found weapon s of mass destruction in Iraq and 22 p er cent thinks the Iraqis used chemical or biolog ical weapon s in the war. Before the c onflict, half of those polled said Iraqis were a mong the 19 hijackers on September 11th when, in fact, there were non e in the FBI's bogu s list. \"It's a striking finding\", said Steve Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University o f''''' Maryland, which condu cted the poll. \"Given the intensive news coverage a nd h igh levels of public a ttention\", he said, \"this level of misinformation suggests s ome Americans may b e a voiding h aving an experience of cogn itive dissonance.\" 43._ That is a long -winded way o f saying their beliefs conflict with the facts. They are mind controlled, reality controlled, by the indoctrination o f beliefs, political and religious. I will go into this at length later because it is tire bottom line of human control. Wilson Bryan Key says in his boo k, The Age of Manipu lation: \"Humans are uniquely d angerous beca use their conceptual blindn ess does not allow them to kno w they are dangerous.\" 44 Today, that applies to America more than anywhere on earth. Every d ay it is more obvious that the 'F' word is precisely what we are facing: fascism. After the horrors of the mid-20th century they said it could n ever happen again. Well it is happening again and, below the surface , it never went away. We a re, as I have been p redicting for more than a decade, fast heading for a global version o f Nazi Germany. Barry Steinhardt, director of the American civil liberties union p rogramm e on technology and liberty, told the New York Times that the a uthorities are demanding records from Internet providers and libraries abou t what book s people a re taking out and the websites they're 100k ing.at. 45 Under a planned bill called the Domestic Security Enhancement Act, the gov ernment could withhold the identity o f anyone detained in conn ection with a 'terror investigation' and their names would b e e xempt from the Freedom of Information act, acc ording to the Washington-based advo cac y g roup , the Centre for Public Integrity}6 I have detailed in books like Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster the staggering extent to which ou r fr eedoms have a lready b een destroyed since September 11 th 2001 and most people have no idea how far this has gon e. Fascists do no t have to wear a swastika on their arm. Who said this? \"An evil exists that threatens every man, woman, and child o f this great nation. We must take steps to ensure our domestic security and p rotect our homeland.\" Who was it? Bush? Cheney? Rumsfeld? Powell? Blair? Blunkett? Yes, they h ave all expressed those sentiments s ince September 11th to justify the milit arisation o f law enforcement and d estruction o f freedom und er the guise of 'Homeland Security'. But they d id no t speak those words. They came from the mouth o f Adolf Hitler when h e was announ cing the c reation o f the Gestapo in Nazi Germany. American society today is being manipulated into the same mind-controlled state to which much o f the German pop ulation succumbed in the 1930s and 1940 s. \"I love Adolf, he's just the kind o f leader Germany n eeds\" - \"I love George, he's just the kind o f leader America needs.\" There is no difference between them in method o r outcome. But, as with Bush supporters in America today, the Hitler-suppo rting Germans could no t see through the smokescreens and the Orwellian Newspeak un til it was too late to turn the tide of hatred and control. We a re such a long way down the Orwellian road, but although the majority still can't see it, the fires of fr eedom are stirring in tile hearts of those with minds to call their own.

The a genda is the c reation o f a global fascist state of centralised d ictatorship and constant control and surveillance, with a world gov ernment, central bank, currency and army d ictating to a microchipped pop ulation. The movie is that Christian-believers in the White House a nd Downing Street are fighting terrorism, protecting the people, and freeing the world from tyranny.

What I have described in these last few chapters is the five-sense level of the c onspiracy, that which directly effects our daily experience in this 'world'. As I walked my journey o f discovery, however, I was to see that the story is much bigger than that - vastly so.

Er, yeah History is the version o f past events that people have decided to agree upon . Napoleon Bonaparte By the mid-1990 s I had b egun to piece together the structure through which the Illuminati could manipulate the masses while maintaining the secrecy essential to their agenda's s uccess. It was clear to me by then that (a) this conspiracy h ad to go b ack a long way and (b) there obv iously h ad to b e some unifying force that was coordinating events through the generations. Quite und erstandably, people a sk why, if the c onspiracy go es back at least thou sands of years, Illuminati operatives would h ave given their lives throughou t that period to achieving global control when they kn ew they would no t be a round to see it? There is an answer to that question and I began to appreciate what it was when an apparently bizarre new theme e ntered my research: reptilian shapeshifters. Yes, I kno w, but stay with me a while. I began to follow the c onspiracy 'back' into history searching for the origin o f the Illuminati and their agenda of global conqu est. I got comfortably b ack to the time of the Crusades in the thirteenth century in the so-called 'Holy Land' and the e lite secret societies established in that period like the Knights Templar, Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller of St. John o f Jerusalem, which no w has two main arms kno wn as the Knights of Malta (official head the Pope) and the Knights or Order of St John o f Jerusalem (official head the British monarch). These secret societies are still Illuminati operations with some of the world's most powerful people a mong their initiates, includ ing Queen Elizabeth II. I continued to go b ack from the Crusade era a nd I was thou sands of years BC before I found anything like a starting point to the Illuminati agenda. It was not, in fact, the origin, which lies way b ack with the a dvanced civilisations known as Atlantis and Lemuria or Mu, and even earlier. These lands were believed to b e located in the Atlantic a nd Pacific Oceans and were destroyed by enormous cataclysmic e vents that started perhaps s ome 11,000 y ears ago (see The Biggest Secret). But there is a later point where you can p ick up the story, around 4,000 to 2 ,000 BC in Sumer, now Iraq, in the \"Land Between the Rivers\" called Mesopo tamia. Su mer or later Sumer is kno wn as the 'cradle of civilisation' to conv entional history b eca use it was so advanced. The Sumerians were the first kno wn p eople to study the stars, develop the written word and enforce a legal code. It was the a rtefacts, texts and records from Sumer and its s uccessors in that land, like the Assyrians and Babylon ians, that were so p rofessionally and systematically looted o r burned after the Fourth Reich's invasion o f Ir aq in 2 003. The British writer and anthropologist, L.A. Waddell, produced a series of brilliant book s abou t Sumer and o ther ancient cultures. He was an expert in Sumerian and Egyp tian hierog lyph ic a nd the Sanskrit language of the Indu s Valley in India. This was a rare gift indeed and it allowed h im to travel these regions, reading the a ncient acc oun ts on the temple a nd monuments, and see that Sumer, Egyp t and the Indu s Valley were parts of one e mpire based on Sumer (Figure 18). See The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix for more of this background and Waddell's work is documented in d etail in his book, Egyptian Civilisation, Its Sumerian Origin And Real Chronology. Waddell also shows in his work, Makers of Civilisation / that the Sumer-centred Empire e xtended no t only to the Indu s Valley in the e ast, but to the British Isles in the west and encompassed much in b etween. It was larger than that of Alexander the Great or the Romans. The Sumer Empire included a large part of the world and it is from this s ame information source that all of the major religions have e merged. From where did Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hindu ism, Budd hism and o thers like Zoroasterism, etc., emerge? The Middle a nd "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 132 Near East and the vast region ruled at one time from Sumer; and it continued to b e dominated by that kno wledge base a nd b elief system in the thou sands of years that followed Sumer's demise. The story o f King Sargon, the Akkadian king who conquered Sumer, is an excellent example. They said that his mother bore him in secret and floated h im in a basket on the River Euph rates, where he was found and b roug ht up by another family.3 The Israelite/Hebrews, or rather their manipu lating p riests, the Levites, later took this ancient story from the Mesopo tamian acc oun ts and u sed it in the story o f Moses. The Old Testament is found ed on Sumerian and Egyptian acc oun ts, edited and rewritten as required, to create a manufactured history and religion called Judaism. The New Testament is based on symbolic stories repeated ov er and over in the thousands of years before it was compiled and these relate to a large e xtent to the Sumerian and Egyp tian religion o f Sun worship and Mystery schoo l rituals. The New Testament texts, in turn, created a manufactured religion and history called Christianity. King Sargon was a major Sun worshipper and these rulers of the Sumer Empire were given the title, \"Son o f the Sun\".4 To the Sumerians, the Sun was a symbol of 'God' and from this came the title Son o f the Sun o r Son o f God. Sumerian emperors were also o ften kno wn as \"The One Lord\". You find the same story in Egypt beca use the two cultures were so conn ected. Waddell discovered from the time lines and the descriptions of the leaders and their genealogy that the rulers of these three great cultures, Sumer, Egyp t and the Indu s Valley were, at least in on e period, the same people und er different names. It is the different names that have obscured the truth to a large e xtent. Historians have taken d ifferent names to mean d ifferent people, but this is not correct. The e ndless 'god s' in the various cultures also turn ou t to b e different names for the same deities. Once you und erstand this, wading into the past becomes a lot less complicated. The a dvantage that Waddell had over conv entional Egyp tologists and 'historians' (apart from an op en mind) was that he could read Sumerian and could decipher inscriptions in Egyp t, which they could no t understand. He could see that early Egyp tian hieroglyph ics were those used by their ruling culture in Sumer. It was only later that they evolved into an Egyp tian system developed more locally. It is the latter that Egyp tologists have been d ecoding. The ea rlier Sumerian hieroglyphics in Egypt flummoxed them, but not Waddell. Here is one e xample of how he proved his point. The Sumerians recorded that King \"basket on the river\" Sargon h ad a son called Manis, who later beca me emperor. At the same time, Waddell shows, the son o f the kiI1gin the Indu s Valley was kno wn as Manja, and in Egypt he was called Manj (abbreviated to Man) - the guy kno wn to the Greeks as Menes and to English Egyptolog ists as Mena. 5 So we have the ruler's s on, and later ruler, in Sumer, Egypt and the Indu s Valley in the same period called v ariously, Manis, Manj and Manja. The reason b ecomes obv ious - it was the same bloke. Even the title given to him was the same or very similar in all three place s. In Egyp t he was kno wn as Manj-the-Warrior; in Sumer he was Manis-the-Warrior; and in the Indu s Valley h e was called Manja-the-Shoo ter. 6 His father, Sargon the Great, is a Semitic name for the Sumerian-Mesopo tamian emperor, King Gin, Gani, or Guni. The Sumer Empire was so large that in the later Babylonian texts he is called the \"King o f the Four Quarters of the World\".

The Incas of South America also u sed this term \"Four Quarters\". In the a ncient Indian epics, Sargon 's s on, Manja, was called \"The Royal Eye of Gopta a nd o f the Four Ends of the Earth\" when h e became e mperor. 7 In Egyp t, India (at the Taj Mahal, for example) and the Christian world y ou also find the four pillar symbolism representing the pillars that hold up the heavens. In the Indu s Valley clay seal records, Sargon and Manja or Menes also called themselves and their dyn asty Gut or Got ('Goth' to the Romans) and u sed the titles Bar or Par which means 'pharaoh', according to Waddell. 8 Gut or Got beca me 'God', a term used by the later Goths. All non-Latin languages in Europe a re derived from the Gothic, including Eng lish, and the a ncient Swedish language is still called \"Sueo-Gothic\".9 The former name for Denmark was \"Goth-land\" and a derivative was Jut- land.10 Gothic a rchitecture so beloved o f the blood lines and the Illuminati, comes from the same source and so do es the horned h eadgear worn by the kings and leaders of European tribes and kingdoms. But these symbols, styles and customs go b ack much further to the techno logically advanced g lobal civilisations kno wn as Atlantis and Lemuria or Mu. The Illuminati Knights Templar used the 'Gothic' style of architecture when they bu ilt the great 'Christian' cathedrals of Europe, which are full of Pagan symbolism and located on ancient Pagan sacred sites. The symbolism of the 'Eye of Gopta' may relate to the widely used Illuminati symbol, the a ll-seeing eye or Eye of Horus, which you will find at the top o f the pyramid on the US dollar bill and on the .reverse of the Great Seal of the United States (Figure 19). It certainly represents the6Ul1 God. The symbols used by the a ncient Sumerian, Babylon ian and Egyp tian d ynasties are still used by the Illuminati today b eca use they are the same bloodlines and are working with the same kno wledge, which h as been h idden away since a ncient ti mes within the Mystery schoo l and secret society networks. Origins of the bloodline I knew by the time I was researching the Sumer period that the Illuminati was obsessed with g enetics and obsessively interbred for some reason. The same blood lines have been installed in the positions of political and econo mic power for thou sands of years. First they were the royalty and n ob ility o f the a ncients and no w they are the leading po liticians, bankers, businessmen and media owners of modern society. So what was it with this bloodline stuff? The Sumerian acc oun ts of their history were to o ffer an answer. Sumer began at the peak o f its powers and then g radually d eclined, indicating a great inpu t of knowledge a t the start that was later lost. The Sumerians had their own explanations for the origin o f this kno wledge a nd their records were rediscovered thou sands of years later. In the mid-1800s and later, tens of thou sands of clay tablets were found in the former land o f Sumer on the site of the Assyrian capital city o f Nineveh n ear what is today Mosul in Iraq. An Englishman, Sir Austen Henry Layard, made this first discovery and o thers have followed. The a stonishing acc oun ts the tablets contain o riginated in Sumer and no t with the later Assyrian culture. Therefore, I refer to them as the Sumerian Tablets. It is estimated that they were buried around 20 00bc, but they tell a story that goes back long b efore to the lost civilisations of Atlantis and Lemuria or Mu and even further.

Besides the floating b asket story o f King Sargon , the Tablets describe the Great Flood and a place called E.DIN (\"The Abod e of the Righteous On ~ '). The Bible speaks of Eden, the garden o f 'God'. The story o f Genesis is a summ ary o f the same basic story told in the Sumerian Tablet§> in far more detail. Interestingly, many o f the terms translated into the English version o f the Old Testament as 'God' come from words that actually mean 'god s', plural, and the Sumerians said the found ers of their civilisation were a race of beings that came to this planet from elsewhere bringing great kno wledge a nd techno logy. They called these beings the Anunn a. Their later Semitic name was AN .UN NAK .KI (\"Those who from Heaven to Earth Came\") and DIN.GIR (\"The Righteous Ones of the Blazing Rockets\"). Anunn a means \"Sons of An\" (later Anu), the 'king' of the Anunn a/ Anunn aki.l1 The name for Sumer in the tablets is KI.EN.GIR, which h as been translated as \"The Land o f the Lord o f the Blazing Rockets\" and also \"The Land o f the Watchers\". The term 'Watchers' is often u sed to d escribe ancient 'god s'. The Egyp tian n ame for their god s, the Neteru, translates literally as 'Watchers'. The Egyp tians s aid that these Watchers came in their 'heavenly bo ats' and in ancient cultures across the world you h ave this constantly recurring theme of 'god s: arriving in some kind o f flying machine to found civilisations and b ring knowledge a nd techniques that were light years ahead o f what existed b efore. In the Indian culture they called the flying craft Vimanas and there were several designs. Some were cigar- shaped while others were described as dou ble-decked with a dome a nd po rthole windows. Both types are regularly d escribed in UFO sightings today. The a ncient Indian texts describe a nti-gravity technology o f the type used in 'flying saucers'. So much so that when the Chinese discovered Sanskrit documents in Tibet and sent them to the University o f Chandrigarh for translation, they were found to contain the kno wledge to build interstellar space ships, acc ording to the University's Dr Ruth Reyna.12 Yet the documents are thou sands of years old! Dr Reyna revealed that these ships were kno wn as \"Astras\" and it was claimed they could fly to any planet. Some texts talk abou t them flying to the Moon . Details of building, flying, and operating the c raft are a ll included. The Chinese, apparently, even u sed p art of the contents in their space programm e. 13 The Sumerian Tablets describe planets of the solar system in bo th number and environment in ways that were only confirmed in the twentieth century. They d escribe how the Anunn aki, later called' god s', created a culture of great advancement and techno logy that was destroyed by Earth catastroph es and flood. The story of the Biblical Great Flood is told at length in the Tablets thou sands of years before the Bible a ppeared. The Sumerian flood h ero, Utnapishtim, was replace d by the name, Noah, when the much later texts of Genesis were compiled from the Sumerian records. The most astonishing information in the Sumerian clay tablets are the detailed d escriptions of how the Anunn aki interbred with hu mans to create a hyb rid race , a fusion o f the genes of humans and the 'god s'. Yet again this is a constantly repeated theme in every p art of the world and can b e seen in the Old Testament narrative, taken from the Sumerian, of the Sons of God (proper ~ translated, the sons of the god s) who interbred with h umanity and created a hyb rid bloodline. Genesis recoun ts: \"When men began to increase in number on the Earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God [the god s] saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they c hose ... The Nefilim were on the Earth in those days - and a lso afterwards - when the sons of God [the g ods] went to the daughters of men a nd h ad children b y them. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown.\" 14 The term Nefilim can b e translated as \"Those Who Descended\" or \"Those Who Fell From The Heavens\". The American researcher, David Sielaff, emphasises that the Nefilim or Nephilim are not the sons of the god s (beni ha-Eloh im), but the offspring o f the interbreeding b etween the \"daugh ters of men\" and the non - humans the Bible ca lls the Elohim. The Illuminati blood lines that rule the world today are the Nefilim, a race of human/non -human h ybrids. They were a lso kno wn in ancient times as the Rephaim, Emim, Zazummim and Anakim, and they were a ll very tall or 'giant' people in those days. IS The Biblical Goliath was a Rephaim and giant in Hebrew is repha. J6 This theme of giants is a c onstant on ~ . Cave paintings found in place s like Japan, South America a nd the Sahara Desert, depict giant people with round h eads towering over human hun ters. Bones of giant people between 8 and 12 feet tall have been found in mound s in Minnesota a nd o ther locations. The Delaware Indians s peak o f a race of giants who on ce lived east of the Mississipp i in enormous cities and the same descriptions of giants in ancient legends and lore ca n b e found everywhere. J7 Scores of giant red-haired mumm ies were discovered in a cave near Lovelock in Nevada and some were seven feet tal1. 18 The Piute Indian legends abou t these giants s ay they were c annibals. They would even d ig up the Piute dead from their graves and eat them, the a ccoun ts claim. 19 Stories of Atlantis include tales of red-haired g iants who acted like vampires, and the giant Nefilim were a ssociated with cannibalism and blood d rinking - just li ke the Illuminati blood lines are today. Most accoun ts s ay that these giants were unfriendly, even ho stile, to the rest of the pop ulation. Often associated with the giants are strange craft that sound v ery much like the 'flying saucers' of modern UFO accoun ts. Genesis tells us that"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 135 the sons of the god s married the daugh ters of men b efore the flood, as well as afterwards, and Numbers calls the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, or descendants of the Anakim (Anunn aki).20 Hero worship According to scholar Zecharia Sitchin, who h as written many bo oks on the Sumerian Tablets, the term \"men o f renown\" in the Genesis passage shou ld read, from its Sumerian o rigin, \"men o f the sky v ehicles\". This puts rather a different complexion on the whole story and makes a great deal more sense of it. The reference to \"heroes of old\" is also relevant. The word h ero comes from the Egyp tian term, hem, which, acc ording to researcher 1:¥.allis Budg e, was\" applied to the king as a representative of the Sun God on Earth\".21 The precise meaning was \"a human b eing who was neither a god no r a daemon\".22 The term has the inference of a c rossbreed race. The writer Homer (8th-9th century BC ) wrote that \"the heroes were exalted abov e the race of comm on men\". The poet, Pindar, (518-438 BC ) used the term, \"hero/hem\", to describe a race \"between god s and men\". Flavius J osephu s, the first century writer and h istorian, said this of the Genesis reference to the interbreeding b etween 'god s' and hu man women: \" ... for many angels of God a ccompanied with women and bega t sons that proved u njust, and de spisers of all that was good, on a ccount of the confidence they had in their own strength; for the tradition is, that these men d id what resembled the a cts of those wtlom the Grecians c all giants.\" 23 The term' angel', which means messenger, became a ssociated with these nonh uman entities that interbred with h umans. The Sumerian Tablets go much further than Genesis in explaining the interbreeding o f 'god s' and hu mans. They d escribe how the Anunn aki set out to create a slave race, later called Homo sap iens, to serve their agenda and ho w they b egan this quest, amid much trial and error, using what we ca ll today test- tube method s. This is described in the Tablets and you can read the a ccoun ts in d etail in the book s of Zecharia Sitchin. 24 The Tablets tell of how the sperm of Anunn aki males was used to fertilise human eggs before they were transplanted to Anunn aki females to b e birthed. All this appears to h ave first happened hund reds of thou sands of years ago, but has continued ever since on v arious scales. I think many o f the stories mentioned in the Tablets refer to events in Lemuria a nd Atlantis. All this makes more und erstandable the c oun tless s tories told today by p eople c laiming to h ave been abdu cted by non -human entities that forced them to h ave sex o r took their eggs. The babies that result often disappear in early pregnancy with no medical explanation. Of course, there a re many 'abdu ction' experiences that are simply invented o r have other, more ea rthly, explanations; but to dismiss them all, given their number and o ften consistency o f detail around the world, would b e just as ridiculous as believing every word o f every on e. Let's hear it for Lulu The Sumerian Tablets tell of how the original breeding p rogramme was headed by the c hief scientist of the Anunn aki, called Enk i, or \"Lord o f the Earth\" (Ki = Earth), and their expert in medicine, Ninkharsag, also kno wn as Ninti (\"Lady Life\"). Mesopo tamian d epictions portray h er holding a horseshoe-shaped tool used at that time to cut the umbilical cord. Another name later given to h er was Mamm i, from which came mama and mother. Mama or ma as a term for mother can b e found in v arious langu ages all over the world. Ninkharsag would later be symbolised in p art by the stream of mother godd ess deities with names like Queen Semiramis, Isis, Barati, Artemis, Diana a nd the Biblical Mary. These were a lso u sed to symbolise the feminine principle a s godd esses of the Moon o r waters, which are c onsidered the feminine balance to the masculine Sun. After many failures and some horrendou s creations, the Tablets indicate, Enki and Ninkharsag p rodu ced a human hyb rid that the Sumerians called a LV.LV (\"One Who Has Been Mixed\") - which appears to b e the Biblical \"Adam' ~ This was the splicing together of the DN A of the Anunn aki with that of the human form kno wn as Homo erectus. Some of these hyb rids were designed to rule a s the 'middle men' or 'demi-god s' between the Anunn aki and the people. What the Bible ca lls \"Adam\", the 'first man', is likely to b e symbolic of \"the Adam\", a genetic stream not an individual. The Biblical \"Eve\" was s uppo sed to h ave been created from a rib o f Adam, but the word from which \"rib\" derived was the Sumerian, TI, which means both rib and life acc ording to the translations of Zecharia Sitchin. To b e c reated from the \"life\" or life e ssence of the Adamic race makes rather more sense than a rib. In the same way, the \"dust from the groun d\" from which the Bible c laims that Adam was created, really translates as \"that which is life\" from the Sumerian term, TI.IT. So Adam was a bit of a TI.IT. Appropriately, the Sumerian n ame for humans was LV, which h as the root meaning o f worker or servant and also implies a domesticated animal like a sheep. Does that not describe the nature of human life today and for a long time past? My o wn research leads me to think that the c laims that the Anunn aki created the human form as we kno w it all over the world are e xaggerated. There have been many examples of interbreeding b etween hu manity and the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 136 extraterrestrial 'god s' of various origins and races and no t just the Anunn aki. It was more that the Anunn aki created DNA streams or blood lines to suit their agenda a nd they h ave c ontinued to infuse their DN A into human blood streams. They seek to rewire the DNA to close down hu manity's interdimensional comm unication and telepathic powers. This puts us in a vibrational prison in which most can p erceive only the very n arrow frequency range accessed by ou r phy sical senses. Official history says that certain hu man forms died out to b e followed by n ew ones and thus Neanderthal man was followed by Cro-Magnon man and then Homo sap iens or modern man. But archaeologists working in the Midd le East have discovered evidence to show that all these phy sical forms existed du ring the same period. The 'missing link' that would conn ect them and explain the sudd en and d ramatic c hanges and appearance of their phy sical forms has never been found b ecause the e stablishment of aca demia would rather stay igno rant than u tter the 'E' word - extraterrestrial. The theme of royal families claiming the right to rule beca use their bloodline was seeded by the god s is a c onstant one a ll over the world, not least in Sumer and Egyp t, and this is the origin o f the Illuminati bloodlines. The 'Israelite' pharaohs Given the sign ificance that the Illuminati gives to ancient Egyp t and the Great Pyramid at Giza (not least on the dollar bill), you would expect an Egyp tian conn ection - and there is. I shou ld stress here, however, that what we ca ll Egypt was not the first civilisation in those lands. In the tens of thou sands of years before the emergence of the Egyp t we kno w from the official history b ooks, this land was called Khemit (I have seen a number of spellings). Khemit conn ected with the a dvanced civilisations of Atlantis and Mu o r Lemuria that existed b efore the vast 'Great Flood ' cataclysms of around 11 ,500 BC (see The Biggest Secret) They were all part of a global society. The word Kh'met in Egyp tian means \"The Black Land\", and this is s aid to refer to the dark, rich soil laid down on the banks of the Nile by the yearly floods. (Deshr'et means \"The Red Land\", from which comes the word 'desert'.) I have also h eard the view that The Black Land refers to a black po pu lation. The pharaohs of Egyp t claimed the right to rule beca use they were c hildren o f the god s and they were a nother expression o f the bloodline seeded around the world to rule on b ehalf of these' god s'. This Egyptian royal line is s eriously important to the Illuminati and it has s urvived intact to the modern era. In more recent years the official history o f the Jewish p eople has been qu estioned by a number of authors and researchers who h ave no motive whatsoever except to establish the truth. In p revious book s, 1 h ave conn ected a people kno wn as the Hyksos to the Biblical Israelites and, as I was completing this work, I came ac ross a series of extremely interesting book s by the British author, Ralph Ellis.2 5 He has focussed especially on the Egyp t connection to the 'royal' bloodlines and the Hyksos are at the heart of his research. The Hyksos are kno wn by h istory as either the \"Shepherd Kings\" or \"Rulers of Foreign Lands\" depending in the translation and are said to h ave invaded Egypt abou t 1720 to 1 650 BC , again d epending on which acc oun t you read. They p rodu ced a number of pharaohs or \"priest kings\" who were initiated into the secrets in the Great Pyramid and the Mystery schoo l dedicated to the Sun at Heliopolis (called On in the Bible). The Hyksos Dynasty ruled from Avaris (hence the word 'avarice' meaning g reedy) in the ea stern delta (see Figure 20). I recomm end Ralph Ellis's book s for a wealth o f detail, but in summ ary h e says that the great figures of 'Jewish' history, like Abraham, King David and King Solomon were pharaohs of the Egyp tian royal line that claimed to b e descended from the 'god s'. I don 't share all of his conclusions and I offer my interpretation o f events at the e nd o f the c hapter, but his general themes are suppo rted v ery much by my own research: a bloodline a nd its associated secret kno wledge came out of Egyp t with the leaders of the Biblical Israelites. As 1 h ave highlighted b efore, you search in v ain for historical evidence outside the Bible for the c haracters kno wn as Abraham, David, Solomon and Moses. Equally lacking is the a rchaeological evidence to suppo rt the Old Testament tales like the mass exodu s of the Israelite people from bondage in Egypt during the period it supposed to h ave happened. This is ludicrous given the scale of the a lleged events and the a pparent stature of these people and the feats for which they were suppo sed to h ave been respon sible. Quite simply, they d id no t exist in their Biblical form. But Ellis presents evidence that the story do es start to make sense if you relocate them to Egyp t and the pharaohs of the Hyksos, the \"Shepherd Kings\" or \"Rulers of Foreign Lands\". These were suppo sed to b e a people from Western Asia, which includes the lands of modem Turkestan in the north, Afghanistan in the ea st, the Mediterranean Sea in the. west and the present Iran and Iraq in the south - the land o f Sumer and Babylon. I think- the Hyksos bloodline ca rne from Sumer for reasons I will outline later. Two o (nie Burner monarchs in their king lists were ca lled \"Shepherd Kings\" and the Sumer /Egyp tian religions were virtually identical. The Egyp tian Sun God called Ra was Shamash in Mesopo tamia a nd bo th were depicted as a winged Sun-disk (a symbol often u sed by the Illuminati today). The Hebrew w ord for Sun is \"Shemesh\"26 and so were the sons of \"Shem\" (hence Semitic) really sons of the Sun? That is a term you find in ancient Egypt, as in sons of Ra. When we speak o f Egyp t we are a lso speaking o f Sumer and Mesopo tamia beca use the two are fund amentally conn ected. As Ralph Ellis writes: "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 137 \"The h istorical record o f Sumer runs s ubstantially parallel to that of Egypt, dating back to some 30 00 BC, with king lists much the same a s to be found in Egypt. Historically, it would appear that at some po int in history, elements of the Sumerian culture sailed a cross to Egypt and that the first dynasty k ings of Egypt, therefore, had much in common with the Sumerian p eoples.\" 27 Figu re 20 : Ancien t Egypt at the time o f the Hyksos (cou rtesy of Ralph Ellis from his book. Tempest and Exodu s Bull-sheep Ellis's research leads him to conclude that the Hyksos never invaded Egyp t from anywhere. They were already there. He says that the Hyksos were Egyp tians who b egan to follow the religion o f the 'sheep' when the a strological age of Aries was proclaimed to h ave started by the priests at the Mystery schoo l at Heliopolis - the Biblical \"On\". He says this caused massive c onflict with those, includ ing the reigning Pharaoh, who suppo rted the c ontinuation o f the worship o f the 'bull' or the e ra of Taurus. Ellis writes that this 'sheep' v 'bull' religious conflict is the c oded meaning o f the \"Shepherd Kings\" (which h e believes is the true translation o f their title) and the c oun tless references to sheep, shepherds, \"good shepherds\" and cattle in the symbo l-sodd en Bible stories. Genesis, for example, says that the patriarch Jacob... \"did separate the lambs ... and h e put all his flocks by themselves, and pu t them not unto Laban's cattle\".2' In the same way, when the a ge of Aries gave way to Pisces in the period related by the New Testament the codes begin to move from shepherds and sheep to fishes and \"fishers of men\". Today we a re in the transition from Pisces to Aquarius. Ellis s ays that Abraham, the Biblical 'father' of the Jewish and· Islamic peoples, did no t come from the lands of Mesopo tamia a s the Bible c ontends, but was instead the son o f an Egyp tian ph araoh. Abraham became the first Hyksos Pharaoh, Ellis s ugg ests, when the Aries followers, or\" Arians\", as he calls them, seized Lower Egyp t, which included the Great Pyramid at Giza a nd the Mystery schoo l at Heliopolis, the City o f the Sun. Upper Egyp t continued to follow the old religion with its centre a t Thebes, Ellis s ays. What is for sure is that the Old Testament stories abou t the Israelite heroes being poo r shepherds are baloney. These were seriously conn ected people, as Ellis s hows, and this royal line that came out of Egyp t is the reason for the Old Testament obsession with g enealogy and all those 'begats'. He says Abraham was a Hyksos pharaoh called Sheshi, whose throne name was Mayebre or Mayebra. Switch the M around , he says, and you h ave a perfect phon etic match for Abram who b ecame Abraham of the Bible. Mam-aye-bra = Ay-bra-ham: "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 138 \"Neither shall thy name be called Abram, but your name shall be called Abraham; for a father of many nations I have made thee. And I shall make thee e xceed ingly fruitful, .. and kings s hall come ou t of thee.\" 29 Abraham's son kno wn as Isaac in the Bible was the Hyksos pharaoh called Anather, says Ellis, and Isaac's son, Jacob, was really the pharaoh whose throne name was Jacobaam. Jacob is the Biblical patriarch who was said to h ave had twelve sons that found ed the \"twelve tribes of Israel\", Ralph Ellis contends that the Biblical exodus of the 'Israelites' was actually a story that combined two mass evacuations from Egypt by the Hyksos and their followers. The major one, he says, happened in the 16th century BC when the c onflict between the Upper and Lower Egyp tian religions, the bull and the sheep, led to the people of 'Abraham' leaving to settle in Palestine a t the time of the Hyksos pharaoh, Yakob aam or Jacobaam (Jacob). According to the Egyp tian historian, Manetho,\" they n umbered 240 ,000 families and the first century Jewish writer, Josephu s, described the t1eeing Hyksos as \"our ancestors\".'] They left for Canaan, disguised by the Biblical texts as Israelites, and sacked Jerusalem. The Hyksos royal line returned to Egyp t, says Ellis, with the Biblical 'Joseph'. He writes that the Genesis \"coat of many colours\" story, when Joseph was sold by his jealous brothers and taken to Egyp t, is s ymbolic of the return o f the bloodline from exile in Canaan. While 'Joseph' was not the first born acc ording to the story, he was the first born o f his father Jacob's 'chief wife' called Rachel. Thus he was the heir. This relates to the bloodline being p assed on through the female. It is the DNA of the mother, not the father, who decides the 'purity' of the genes from the 'royal' point of view. The Illuminati follow the same principle to this day and the 'chief wife' or 'first wife' symbolism continues with titles like 'First Lady' for the wife of an American p resident. The Biblical story go es that Joseph b ecame 'vizier' or chief minister to the pharaoh and the Old Testament tells us that he married the daugh ter of a priest at the Hyksos sacred Mystery schoo l at Heliopolis. His wife a s from the Egyp tian royal bloodline. Not bad for a humble shepherd who was sold into slavery by merchants. But, of course, that's just the Biblical cover story. Joseph was considered to b e of the royal line of Hyksos pharaohs. His job, says Ellis, was to regain the throne for the Hyksos and by becoming chief aide to the pharaoh, who did no t at first kno w his background, he was in the perfect position to b egin the process. There are many examples in history o f the line of 'chief advisors' to the royal family eventually taking over the throne. One is the Stewards in Scotland, chief aides to the kings, who b eca me the Stuart Dynasty. The Bible c laims that Joseph's brothers came back to Egyp t and so, says Ellis, an und erground alternative royal line lay in waiting. He says that it took 2 00 y ears before the future pharaoh, Amenho tep III, married a daugh ter of the 'Joseph' Hyksos line of royal 'stewards' or 'advisors'. By the way, the title of 'Amen' used in ancient Egypt, as in Amenho tep, is the origin o f the \"Amen\" used in 'Christian' services because the 'Christian' religion is based on the Sun worship o f Egypt, Sumer and elsewhere. Ellis writes: \"Both Amenhotep II and Amenhotep III were called 'hyk' in their royal title - meaning 'Shepherd King'. More interestingly, their origins are a lso listed in the record and Amenhotep II's full title is the 'Hyks os King of Heliopolis'; which makes s ense a s this was the sacred temple a nd un iversity of the Hyks os princes. Egyptologists are strangely s ilent on this fact.\" 32 Out of Egypt II Ellis s ays that a son o f Amenho tep III, the \"Shepherd King\", was highly likely to h ave been the Biblical character called Moses, who was from the Egyp tian royal family o f priest-kings and no t a \"poor Israelite\". \"Moses\", writes Ellis, was probably Tuthmoses, brother of Amenho tep IV, the future pharaoh b etter kno wn to h istory as Akhenaton. The Bible story o f Moses being found by the pharaoh's daugh ter floating on the Nile in a basket of bulrushes (a later steal from the King Sargon story) was designed to h ide this fact. His brother Akhenaton married Nefertiti from the 'vizier' line going b ack to 'Joseph' because he knew that they were both from the same bloodline. The a ncient royal families married their daugh ters and sisters to k eep the bloodline pure a nd this continues today among the Illuminati families, although it is hidden by h aving children 'out of wedlock' and b ring ing them up und er other names before reuniting them later in marriage. Incest is a fund amental part of life for the Illuminati families, as it was for the a ncient bloodlines from which they o riginate. They are obsessed with maintaining the genetic c onn ection to the 'god s'. The Hyksos pharaoh Amenho tep IV changed h is name to Akhenaton when he sough t to transform the religion o f the coun try to a worship o f \"One God\" - the Sun, or perhaps more acc urately, the \"power behind the Sun\".]] Akhenaton (remarkably close to Ashkenazim) was another priest-king educated at Heliopolis where the centre of worship was the tower kno wn as the Benben stone. This was a round tower with a c onical top - the phallic symbo l of the bloodline of the god s. This is the real meaning o f the obelisks all over the world, like the George Washington memorial in Washington DC, the 'mysterious' round towers of Ireland and the constant use of the obelisk in memorials instigated by Freemasons. In Londo n, Paris and New Y ork you will find o riginal obelisks taken from Egypt beca use this is s till the religion o f the Illuminati families that moved ou t of the Near and Middle East and North Africa to take c ontrol of the wider world. The Benben"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 139 stone a t Heliopolis s tood within the Temple of the Phoenix and the pho enix o r 'Bennu ' bird was in the first design o f the Great Seal of United States because the bloodlines were behind the c reation o f the USA. Later the Phoenix was s ymbolised in the seal as the ea gle (which also h as its own esoteric meaning) and for this reason you will find the ea gle used in n ational symbolism across the world _ includ ing Nazi Germany. No doub t at least some of them represent the pho enix. Akhenaton, an \"Arian\" or follower of the c ult of Aries, says Ralph Ellis, moved the ca pital of Egypt to a place ca lled Amarna when h e became pharaoh and on ce a gain there was a furious respon se from those among the priesthood and the people following the religion h e wanted to replace. Also in the ce ntre of this conflict, it seems, was Akhenaton's brother, Tuthmoses, who, like the Moses in the Bible, gave up h is royal birthright to his brother. Moses gave it to Aaron while Tuthmoses did the same for Akhenaton b ecause of wound s that made Moses/Tuthmoses less than the 'perfect specimen' a pharaoh h ad to b e. Moses and Tuthmoses and Aaron and Akhenaton appear to b e same characters, says Ellis. Anyway, in the religious conflict und er Akhenaton h e a nd h is followers (the Biblical Israelites that had no t left in the first exodu s) were exiled to a remote part of Egyp t and segregated from the rest of the people in an area of stone quarries. This is s uppo rted by the Biblical narrative in its s tory o f Moses, Aaron and the 'Israelites'. Ellis s ays that Akhenaton's father, Amenho tep Ill, appeared to b e a sort of joint-pharaoh op erating \"co-regency\", but when he died Akhenaton took ov er everything. He banned all \"graven images\" of the old religion. The Great Pyramid was obv iously a key p art of Egyp tian religion and Ralph Ellis believes that this appears in the Bible und er the c ode name of \"Moun t Sinai\". Moses was said to h ave c limbed Moun t Sinai to rece ive the Mosaic Law or Ten Comm andments from 'God'. But the Bible ac tually says that Moses went into the mountain to meet with God. Does God live in a cave then? Much more likely that this is referring to entering a ritual chamber of the pyramid where the Egyp tian p riests went to conv erse with the god s. Incidentally, the Ten Comm andments are very similar to the Egyp tian Declaration of Innocence in the Judgement of the Dead.34 As unrest grew among the people, the Israelites s end an army o f 200 ,000 from Jerusalem to Avaris to suppo rt their blood line brothers. The a nti-Akhenaton p riesthood h ad installed his brother (often reported to be his s on) Tutankh amen as the e ight-year-old boy-king. He had changed h is name from Tutankh aton at their insistence. Eventually came the second and much smaller exodu s as Akhenaton and Tuthmoses left to join their Egyptian b rothers and sisters in Canaan. This is the e xodu s referred to in the Bible, but with the magnitude of the first one included in the tale, Ralph Ellis concludes. The Bible says that when Moses died he was buried in the land called Moab - the name of the American weapon o f mass destruction o r Mother of all Bombs. Ellis s ays that Moab (Mera or Merab) was in fact Egyp t. No wond er, as I reported earlier, that Moab is associated with Freemasonry. 'House of David' Ellis goes on to p resent more c ompelling evidence that 'King David' and his s on 'King Solomon' (for whom there is no mention in the historical record ou tside the Biblical-Jewish acc oun ts) were, in fact, another two Egyp tian ph araohs called Psusennes II (David) and Sheshonq I (Solomon). Psusennes II was the last pharaoh o f the twenty-first dyn asty with his court based at Tanis in the ea stern Delta lands the true location of the original Temple of Solomon, Ellis s ugg ests. Psusennes II's official title a pparently means s omething like \"My Star that Appears in His City\". King David, of course, is associated with the 'Star of David' and 'City o f David'. Ellis contends that the Hebrew name for King David was \"Duad\", which is close to the Egyp tian word for star, prono unced d juat. The full title for the daugh ter of Psusennes II was Maatkare Mutenhat or Maatkare Mu-Tamhat while King David's daugh ter is named in the Bible a s Maachah Tamar 11. 35 No archaeological record h as been found o f King David in the lands attributed to Israel, ·but references to h is real self, Psusennes II, have been d iscovered.36 The sugg estion is that Psusennes II of the Hyksos bloodline a rrived with an army to seize the unified monarchy o f the Israelite tribes from King Saul and h e passed this on to his s on, Sheshonq I (King Solomon). Once a gain these were priest kings, the bloodline of the 'god s', and expert in esoteric 'magic' - hence the reputation o f Solomon for having such powers. Ralph Ellis presents an extremely well researched case for this 'Hyksos kings' scenario and the mass of inter-conn ecting d etail can b e found in his many excellent books.

This happened most comprehensively after the invasion o f the Israelite/Judean lands by the Babylonian army o f King Nebuchadnezzar in 5 87 BC when most - but not all- of the former Israelite/Egyp tian 'Tribe of Judah' were taken into captivity in Babylon in the former lands of Sumer. Babylon was a melting po t of peoples and bloodlines and a centre for what we would call Satanic ritual and black magic. The ca ptivity o f the Israelites in Babylon did not mean p rison cells. They were not allowed to leave, but they could go abou t their business and they came into contact with the religious s tories and myths from Sumer and the Sumer- Babylon ian technique of controlling the people through interest on money. Cuneiform texts discovered in Babylon show that during the reign o f King Kandalanu (648 -625 BC ) one banker, Jacob Egibi, was charging an interest rate of 20 p er cent. 38 The Illuminati, who largely came out of Babylon, have been playing the same scam ever since. Only after the 70-year captivity did the Levite priesthood p roduce the texts that became the Torah (the law), the first five book s of the Old Testament also kno wn as the Pentateuch that are officially attributed to \"Moses\". This was hund reds of years after the e vents were suppo sed to h ave taken p lace . These texts created new 'Is.ra ~ 1i ~ e' names for former Egyp tian ph araohs and made up stories to p rovide a n o fficial history that suited their interests. The invented n ame of Solomon includes in every syllable a word meaning the Sun - Sol-am-On. Solomon means Sun-Sun-Sun. Hot stuff. Whenever they wanted the people to do something they wrote that 'God' had comm anded it. They u sed the basket on the river story o f King Sargon in Mesopo tamia to cover the truth abou t the man they dubb ed \"Moses\" and introdu ced the c haracter of \"St Michael\", the Sumerian Tas Mi-ki-gal, the dragon slayer and Lord o f Agriculture. 39 He was later called the Lord o f the Air and g iven wings to fly. There were no 'angels' in Israelite belief until the Babylon captivity.40 The Babylonian h oly d ays were turned into the 'Jewish' holy d ays, includ ing the Passover and Feast of the Tabernacles. 41 The Levites relocated the Sumerian and Egyp tian stories and themes to lands that they called Israel. The high initiates through the ce nturies have und erstood the c oded story, but the mass of the people who h ave called themselves J ewish h ave been sold a lie, a c over story, to imprison their minds and make them slaves to their hierarchy. Even circumcision, so fund amentally associated with the Jewish faith, came from ... Egyp t. Of course it did. What really is Zionism? The sacred p lace of the Jewish faith is Zion, hence Zionism. It is variously claimed to b e Jerusalem and apparently Mount Sinai - Moun t Zion - which Ralph Ellis s ays in his books is code for the Great Pyramid at Giza. But Ellis writes: \" ... the na tion that built ... [ Jerusalem] ... was primarily influenced b y three p yramids at Giza, which were now regarded a s the three symbolic foundations of the Judaic people and their religion. When, according to the famous s ong, the Israelites s at down in Babylon a nd remembered Zion, they were not just reminiscing about their lost City of David; they were a lso remembering the long-lost days when they c ould ph ysic ~ visit their primary temple in Egypt - the Great Pyramid a t Giza.\" 42 Ellis s ays that when the scribes reminisced abou t Giza, they symbolised Zion as a moun tain o r a desert monument (\"Tsion \" in Hebrew) and when they were symbolising Zion as J erusalem it was described as a castle. But even with the latter, Egyp t is centre stage once a gain. Ellis makes the following comparison between the Judean Zion o f Jerusalem and the Egyp tian city o f Tchian o r Zian (known today as Tanis) where the walls were stamped with the ca rtouche or code of the pharaoh, Psusennes II (King David): Judean Zion  Egyptian Zian Called Jebu s  Called Jebe t (Tchebet) Known a s a castle Known a s a fortress Identified with a rock Known a s the\" Rock\" Called the City of King David Called the City of King Psusennes II 43 Zion ism is not abou t fulfilli ng the Biblical text as read by the masses. It is dedicated to the global dictatorship o f the Egyp tian - Sumerian royal dyn asties s eeded by the 'god s'. They h ave recaptured Sumer and Babylon (Iraq), so do es this mean \"Look ou t Egypt\"? Alongside the bloodlines is the religion o f the Sun God. Ralph Ellis writes that the Hebrew w ord Eli has the root meaning o f \"ascension\" or to \"climb u p\" - the rising Sun.+! So we have the name, Isra-eli-tes. The name Eli is also u sed as E1.

In Hebrew, Samson (Shimshown) means \"a representation o f the Sun\". ~ ' The worship of the Moon is also implied in the name of the Hebrew god , YH WH or Yahweh. Ralph Ellis writes: \"Could the ineffable, the un spea kable. name of the Israelite g od be e tched into the walls of the g reat Temple o f Karnak perhaps? It may s eem incredible. but I think that this is precisely the case. The first two letters of the tetragrammaton are YH and the p resumed vowel in the middle is an 'a'. giving the syllable of 'yah'. Turning to the Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary of Wallis Budge , it can be seen that the name Yah can be translated a s 'the Moon'. Here, at last, is c onfirmation that the p resumptions I have made a re stand ing on secure foundations. If the word Yahweh was derived from Egypt, it is highly likely to ha ve h ad some lunar connotation.\" 46 The Rothschild \"kings\" I have a lso stressed the key role in the c onspiracy o f the Rothschild family and it is no surprise that their name Rothschild o r \"Red Shield\" can b e traced b ack to Egyp t and the Hyksos kings. Ellis reports that the Hyksos/lsraelites wore protective talismans in the form of a 'star shield' that beca me the 'Star of David'. This is today displayed on the flag o f the Rothschild-created-and controlled State of Is-ra-el (Figu re 21). What's more, the Hyksos kings were closely associated with the colour red. The c rown o f the Hyksos pharaohs in Lower Egyp t was the Red Crown, kno wn as the djesher-t (djesher in Egyptian meant red and the first-born sons of Israel were sometimes identified by a scarlet thread on their wrist).47 The Rothschilds or Redshields are of the Hyksos royal line, as are many o ther Illuminati families, and this is why they don /t give a damn abou t the plight of the mass of Jewish p eople in g eneral who are not of this 'royal' line of the god s. Do most British monarchs give a damn abou t the 'comm on p eople' over whom they 'reign'? Exactly. Out of Babylon came the c oded cover story p rodu ced by the Levites that we kno w as the Old Testament and the book s of the Torah o r Pentateuch that are the basis of Judaism. The Levites were the priestly tribe of 'Moses' and' Aaron' or Akhenaton and I wond er if the Levites were really the bloodline going b ack to the priests at Heliopo lis? What also emerged from Babylon was the truly appalling, unspeakable, Babylon ian Talmud on which the more e xtreme forms of the belief system are found ed. This takes precedence over the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jewish religion that has held the minds of its believers in thou sands of years of servitude ca me from these perversions of the truth inspired in Babylon. It was this manufactured v ersion o f 'God' and history into which the Khazars were c onv erted Figu re 2j: The Star of David or Psusenne s II - the Roth (Red ) Shield. It is no w on the flag o f the Rothschild-crea ted and con trolled State o f Is-Ra-EI abou t 740 AD , but their elite would h ave kno wn the real score. There is no way in the world that the Roman royal bloodline of Byzantium would h ave bred with a Khazar princess to p rodu ce Emperor Leo the Khazar, for example, unless the lady was from the 'bloodline of the god s'. Indeed, especially as s he was female, the route through which the c rucial DNA is preserved across the generations. The Egyp tianSumerian royal bloodlines expanded throug hout the world and this is why evidence has been d iscovered, as I outlined in The Biggest Secret and Children o f the Matrix, that Egyp tians and their associated Sumerians and Phoenicians s ettled in Britain and Ireland thou sands of years before the Christian era. It was they who bu ilt the great mono liths and stone c ircles like Stonehenge and Avebury. These bloodlines also expanded through the Caucasus Moun tains and into the lands of the later Khazars. Same origins, different spin "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 142 Islam is also b ased on the stories of people like Abraham - the first Hyksos pharaoh according to Ralph Ellis. He points out that the name of Allah, the Islamic God is derived from the Hebrew Eli (the spelling in Hebrew is almost identical) which means ascension and \"to rise up\" - the rising Sun. In turn, we have Heli, the Greek word for Sun, and all go b ack to Egyp t where, for example, the Sun God Aton is almost certainly the origin o f another Hebrew name for God, Adhon (plural ~ Adhon ai). Christianity, too, came out of Babylon in its s tructural form and the world's three major religions all originated from/the fabricated allegorical stories of the \"royal bloodline\" of Egypt and its closely associated b lood lines of Sumer fr om where Noah is s aid to h ave resided and p rodu ced his offspring o f the god s. Noah is another code for the bloodline (see Children o f the Matrix). To think that these three religions, based on the same misrepresentations, have been fighting eac h o ther all these years! It is the same with the Hindus and Muslims. It is the c omm on o rigins of Judaism and Christianity that has led to bo th Jews and the Pope wearing a skullcap. It symbolises the way the priests in the Mystery schoo ls of Egyp t and elsewhere would shave their heads in that same place . Christian monk s and such like have don e the same. The Pope a lso holds a shepherd's crook , a symbol in Egypt of the Shepherd Kings, and even the title of Pope c ould well originate from the Egyp tian Hyksos king, Apopis IUS This can also b e pronoun ced\" Apapi',' and the original 6th d ynasty v ersion o f his name was Papi or Popi. 49 This could b e the root of Papa, Pop and Pope, all versions of \"father\". Christianity may appear to h ave moved from the 'Holy Land' to Rome, but the Roman Church that turned Christianity into the state religion was s imply the Church' of Babylon transplanted when the Illuminati moved their headqu arters from Babylon to Rome. That is why the Christian religion, and its churches, are awash with ancient 'Pagan' symbolism (see The Biggest Secret). The Babylon ian trinity o f Nimrod the fish), his 'son', Tamm uz (who 'died to save the sins of humanity') and his other', Queen Semiramis (the dov e), were transformed into Christianity's 'Father, and Holy Ghost'. That may seem to h ave ousted the female or godd ess from the trinity, but Roman Catholicism venerates Mary, the virgin 'Mother of Jesus', in the same way that the Egyp tians did with Isis, the virgin 'Mother of Horus', and the Babylonians did with Semiramis, the virgin 'Mother of Tamm uz'.

The same basic story o f 'born on December 25th, died to save humanity, etc., etc.', was widely told thou sands of years before Christianity about the e xploits of the Sun god s in many and v arious cultures, including Rome (Mithra) and Babylon (Tamm uz - the 'Son o f the Sun God'), Tamm uz and Nimrod are symbolised in endless forms around the a ncient and modern world and this includes 'Jesus', This is why 'Christian' churches always orientate to the e ast - the direction o f the rising Sun, Nimrod was worshipped (and still is) as 'The House of the Rising Sun'. This is precisely what 'Christian' churches are a nd thus they are often targeted for Satanic rituals. What better place c ould the Satanists have? The churches are full of Babylon ian symbolism venerating Nimrod/Baal/Tamm uz and surrounded by d ead bo dies in the c hurchyard. The halos used in pictures of the Gospel heroes are inspired by the way the a ncients portrayed their Sun god s with h alos to symbolise what they represented. Jesus is called 'the Light of the World' beca use he is another name for the Sun God/Son, Nimrod/Tammuz, and h e is s ymbo lised as a fish b eca use that was the symbol of Nimrod in Babylon. When Nimrod was killed it was said that his body was cut into piece s and his wife/mother, Queen Semiramis, found all the piece s except his penis. Exactly the same story was told abou t Osiris and Isis in Egypt. Nimrod was said to h ave 'ascended' to the Sun and b ecome the Sun God 'Baal' - a major Illuminati deity to this day. As the Sun rose in the morning, the Babylon ians believed it was Nimrod/Baal 'rising again'. At Sunset, they said, he went to fight off evil creatures in the ocean, only to return again every morning - victorious! Queen Semiramis s aid that it was Nimrod, as the rays of the Sun, who impregnated h er to conceive Tamm uz. It was claimed that Tamm uz (or Damu and Damm uzi as he is also kno wn) was the reincarnation o f Nimrod and it was s aid, therefore, that the \"Father and son are one\". This is the origin o f the same c laim by 'Christianity' that the Father God (Nimrod) and h is s on, 'Jesus' (Nimrod/Tamm uz), are one. The Gospel stories are a ctuality symbo lic tales abou t Nimrod/Tamm uz using the names 'God' and 'Jesus' with 'Mother Mary' and 'Mary Magdalene' added to represent different expressions of Queen Semiramis. Mother Mary is kno wn as the 'Queen o f Heaven' - exactly the title given to Semiramis in Babylon. Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a prostitute or whore in the Bible - Queen Semiramis is the 'Whore of Babylon'. Christianity is the Sun religion o f Babylon and when Illuminati operatives like Bush, Blair and the British royal family claim to b e 'Christians' and attend 'Christian' services, they are, in fact, kno wing ly worshipping Nimrod/Tammuz/ Semiramis, the Babylon ian trinity. When o thers talk abou t the 'bloodline of Jesus' surviving to b ecome the Meroving ian kings, this is really code for the bloodline of Nimrod, Tamm uz and Semiramis: the bloodline of Babylon. The 'Jesus blood line' story p romoted by p eople like the British author, Sir Laurence Gardner, claims th9,t Jesus married Mary Magdalene a nd p rodu ced children that continued the bloodline that beca me Meroving ian! [I lluminati] royalty. I would suggest that such stories are simply code representing 'the bloodline of Nimrod (Jesus) and Queen Semiramis (Mary Magdalene). Queen Semiramis proclaimed that Nimrod/Baal would b e present on Earth after his death in the form of a flame and that's the real origin o f the Illuminati symbol of the flame or lighted torch. This is what the Statue of Liberty is holding! When Tamm uz died, Semiramis s aid that he had \"ascended to h is father\" and would also b e worshipped as a flame. The 'Christian' festival of Easter comes from the same source. Easter comes from the Babylon ian godd ess, Ishtar, (Semiramis again) and it celebrated h er son, Tamm uz, who was, wait for it, the \"on ly b egotten son o f the Moon godd ess and Sun God \" - Nimrod and Semiramis. The \"Easter\" (Ishtar) eggs and the \"Easter bunn y\" also come from Babylon. Queen Semiramis s aid she came from the Moon in a giant egg and this beca me kno wn as the Ishtar egg. Tamm uz was said to b e very fond o f rabbits and so we have the Easter bunny . Oh y es, and they also ate \"sacred cakes\" with a T on the top - the origin o f our hot cross bun s. The T is a major symbol of Freemasonry b eca use of its associations with Babylon and Tamm uz. The Christian wafer used in Catholic ce remonies comes from the Egyp tian ta-en-aah - the sacrificial bread o f the Moon . 50 Christians think the bread symbolises the 'body o f Jesus' when they are really involved in a ritual about the Egyp tian Moon god . It doesn't take much b rain po wer to see the true meaning b ehind d rink ing red wine a s the 'blood o f Jesus'. Mine's a type A, please barman. Other representations of Semiramis, by the way, include Athena (Greece), Minerva (Egyp t and Greece ), Astarte (Syria), Cybele (Rome), Ashtoreth (Israel) and Diana (Ephesus). Diana, the great godd ess of the Merovingians, is s ymbolised as the Godd ess of the Moon , child birth and h unting. Diana is Semiramis, the' godd ess who came from the Moon ', who g ave birth to Tammuz and was married to Nimrod, the 'hun ter'. Semiramis is everywhere und er different names and Princess Diana's murder in Paris in 1997 was a symbolic ritual sacrifice to.'\\Semiramis (see The Biggest Secret). In Illuminati symbo lism, Prince Charles (Sun God/Nimrod) impregnated Princess Diana (Queen Semiramis) to p roduce Prince William (Tamm uz), the 'Son o f the Sun God' who was indu ced to b e born when? On June 21st - the summ er solstice, the major day o f worship to the Sun. Ralph Ellis believes that behind all this s ymbo lism and make-believe there was a man on whom 'Jesus' was; based (although v ery different to the Gospel hero d epicted by Christianity). He says that the c laim that 'Jesus' was of the House of David was an indication that he was claiming to b e of the Egyp tian Hyksos bloodline (pharaohs were ca lled the \"Son o f God \" - bloodline of the god s).

An alternative view to the 'bloodline of Jesus' story and its associated secret society, the Priory o f Sion, can b e found at http://www .alpheus.org/html/articles/esoteric_history/richardsonl.html. I would add this point also. I read stories abou t the bloodline, including the Merovingians, \"almost dy ing out\" and that Jesus was the last of the line who h ad to p ass on h is bloodline to k eep it alive and so on . Oh please. These a ncient 'royal' lines in their various forms are a ll over the world and, I stress again, they are passed on through the female line that history largely do es not record. History follows the men. Large numbers of blood line births are a lso ou tside marriage a nd the real parentage is not recorded. The bloodline depended on on e man? Are you k idding? And the free masons too ... When famous Illuminati names go to church - be it Christian o r 'Jewish' - they kno w w hat the symbolism and the texts really mean. They kno w they are taking p art in an ancient pre-Christian o r pre-Jewish ritual celebrating their blood line a nd o rigins. These religious rituals are the 'outer' kno wledge presented in code while the 'inner' kno wledge is passed do wn through the highest levels of the secret society n etwork, which is based, once a gain, on the same bloodline a nd Egyp t-Sumer-Babylon o rigins as the major religions. Freemasonry is usually trace d to the 1600 s when the guilds of masons who b uilt the ca thedrals (using the sacred g eometry o f the a ncient pyramid b uilders and coded architecture) began to allow outsiders to join. The Mother Lodg e of Freemasonry was formed in London on June-24th 17 17. But informed Freemasons kno w that is not their true origin.

This is why you find the symbols of Freemasonry do minated by the tools of the builder or architect, like the c ompass and h amm er. The hamm ers banged on a block by judges in their courts are a lso Freemasonic symbols relating to the 'Great Architect' and Egyp t. The Illuminati created and control the 'justice' system, as I have long highlighted. Freemasonry o r 'The Craft' is focussed on the building and re-building o f King Solomon's Temple that was located, it is s aid, in Jerusalem on the site of the present El-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Moun t. King Solomon = Egyp tian King Sheshonq I, says Ralph Ellis. The Freemasonic hero is called Hiram Abif (the \"widow's s on\"), who is claimed to b e the chief architect of Solomon's Temple a nd the man the Bible refers to as Hiram. But once a gain Ralph Ellis makes the Egyp tian conn ection. The c hief designer for Sheshonq 1 's temples in Egyp t was called Harem Atif (\"Hiram is my father\"), he says.51 Harem or Hiram was a royal/priestly title in Egyp t and u sed by some pharaohs, as with Haremheb. Temple Moun t to the Arabs is Harem a-Sharif. The Egyp tian and Freemasonic godd ess kno wn as Ma'at was depicted as a symbol of truth and justice a nd you will find h er on many court buildings with h er arms out stretched ho lding a sword and scales. The title of magistrate is derived from Ma'at, who assisted Osiris in the judgment of the dead by weighing their hearts. 52 As the Egyp tian k nowledge a nd b loodline passed through history, Ma'at became kno wn to the Greeks as Themis and h er ability to foresee the future a llowed h er to b ecome one of the oracles at Delphi and the \"goddess of divine justice\".5] The Roman godd ess of justice was called Justitia a nd she was often po rtrayed as balancing bo th scales and a sword while wearing a blindfold. One of the major secret societies that carried the kno wledge from Egypt and Sumer at the time of the Roman Empire was the Comacine Masters, the Roman expression o f the Mystery schoo l known as the Dionysian Artificers. They u sed the same symbols that we see in 'modern' Freemasonry, including the black and white squares on the floor of their temples. Appropriately, you see this in many churches and the great cathedrals of Europe. The c athedrals were built to the sacred g eometry o f Egyp t and Sumer by the Knights Templar a{ld their associated secret societies and g roup s. See The Biggest Secret for a vast amoun t of information about such matters and the symbolism of the Illuminati. I have stressed that the agenda is to create a global fascist state a nd we ca n find the symbo l for that in Egypt and the Freemasons. The word for axe in Egyp t was neter, which is very close to n eter-kherti, a term that means quarryman o r stonemason. 54 This is highly likely to b e the real meaning o f the a xe in the symbol of the fasces (an axe a nd bund led rods) - the origin o f the word fascism. The a xe was also associated with the godd ess, the key figure in Illuminati ritual. Ma'at was sometimes portrayed ho lding the fasces in on e hand and a flame (the main Illuminati symbol) in the other. The 22nd d egree of the Scottish Rite is called a Prince of Libanus or Knight of the Royal Axe. The following is a Freemasonic e xplanation o f this degree a nd no te the mention o f the Hyksos: \"This degree teaches that all labor is honorable, and the 'toiling millions' should be respected and a ssisted [sure]. The Phoenicians [of Egypt/Sumer origin], especially those of the city of Tsidun, are remembered a s those who cut ceda rs on Mount Libanus (Lebanon) for Noah's ark, as well as the Ark of the Covenant and the Temples of Jerusalem. The p eoples of Phoen icia, Hiram of Tyre a nd Hiram Abif included, were tied to the Israelites by the fact that they s hared the mysteries, and it is even said that the Etrurian and Roman Colleges of Artificers descended from them via the Hyks os.

Freemasons controlled bo th sides in the American War of Independence when the Mother Lodg e in London made sure the 'right' side won to give the illusion that the new U nited States was no long er controlled from England (see The Biggest Secret). Of the 55 signatories of the American Declaration o f Independence, at least 50 were kno wn to b e Freemasons and on ly on e known no t to b e.

One of the Illuminati code names for their agenda is \"New World Order\" or \"New O rder of the Ages\". The Pyramid and All-Seeing Eye was put on the dollar bill by President Franklin Delano 'Illuminati' Roosevelt and his later Vice-President, Henry Wallace , who believed that America was chosen by God (the god s) to lead the world in establishing the New World Order.

The British pharaohs The Coronation o f the British monarch is inspired by the c rowning ceremonies for the pharaohs of Egyp t passed down through the Israelites. In 1953 , when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in Westminster Abbey, the Archbishop o f Canterbury turned to the north, south, east and west (the four points of the Pagan cross) and the c ong regation shouted \"God save the Queen\". This was s ymbolic of the story in the Old Testament described the c rowning o f Saul as King o f Israel when p eople shou ted \"God save the King\". This cry can b e found eight times in the Old Testament when the kings of Israel are c rowned. The Queen sat in the Coronation Chair, under which was the ancient \"Scone Stone\" that legend says was brough t from Egyp t/Israel. In h er hands were the Egyp tian symbo ls, a sceptre and a rod. On the top o f the sceptre was a Maltese Cross (symbol of the Illuminati Knights of Malta) and on the rod was a dov e (the symbol of Babylon's Queen Semiramis). She later held an o rb with the Maltese Cross on the top, the same a s those used by the Dutch (and h igh-Illuminati) House of Orange. Queen was anointed with oil, the a ncient tradition that goes back thou sands of the years to the Egyp t-Sumer era a nd b eyond . The word Christ means \"Anointed One\". The oil used in the British Coronation is the same mixture a s that used in Egyp t and Israel. It is carried in a gold v essel called an ampoule made in the form Man eagle (pho enix) and legends also conn ect this part of the ceremony to the dov e (Queen Semiramis). The oil is s ymbo lic of the \"m e sseh\" fat of the c rocodile used in the c oronation ceremonies for the pharaohs in ancient Egyp t. From this we get \"messiah\" - the Jewish legend o f the c oming \"messiah\" - the one a nointed with the fat of the c rocodile: the new pharaoh. The anointing at the Coronation is s uppo sed to elevate the monarch to the rank o f High Priest and in this case, appropriately, High Priestess of the Church o f England, as well as head o f state. While this was happening, the Archbishop o f Canterbury said: \"As k ing, priests and p rophe ts were ano inted: and a s Solomon was ano inted b y Zadock the p riest, Nathan the p rophet, so be thou anointed, blessed and consecrated Queen over the pe ople whom the L ord thy God has given thee to rule a nd g overn ... \" The Coronation Crown is s et With 12 jewels together with two d epictions of the Maltese Cross, one of the most prominent symbols of the Nazis. In the Levite authored Exodu s we hear of the Breastplate of Aaron, which is s et with 12 stones. The same stones, in the same order, appear on the British crown. And who do es Ralph Ellis s ay Aaron was? Akhenaton!! The Archbishop place d h is hand b etween those of the Queen to pay ho mage to the new head o f his Church and h e kissed h er right hand. Then h e said: \"The L ord Almighty ... establish your throne in righteou sness, that it may stand for evermore, like a s the Sun before h im, and a s a faithful witness in hea ven.\" This is almost a repeat of the words used in \"God's covenant\" with David in the Old Testament. The \"Lord Almi ghty\" was called El-Shaddai and we a re talking Nimrod/Baal from Babylon. The Coronation is completed with the \"Coronation Anthem\" called Zadock the Priest, the man who is said to have performed the c oronation ceremony of King Solomon (Sheshonq I). Wherever you look you find the ancient 'royal' bloodlines, their rituals and agenda, and their goal is global domination as I have been warning all these years. Rep-tales OK , so it is clear that the interbreeding \"bloodlines of the god s\" who ruled the a ncient world continue to rule today. But who are these bloodlines and who are the 'god s' that seeded them? The Sumerian Tablets reveal that the Anunn aki were a reptilian race , as widely confirmed when you read o ther ancient accoun ts. A Sumerian Tablet dating to around 35 00 BC leaves us in no doub t as it describes the a rrival of the Anunn aki: \"The reptiles verily d escend.\" 57 In Hebrew myth, the Biblical \"Nefilim\", the \"sons of the god s\", are ca lled aww im, which means devastators or serpents. The symbol of the Hyksos kings was the snake a nd Egyp tian royalty were very much associated with reptilian imagery. Even academics like Dr Arthur David Horn, former Professor of Biological Anthropology at Colorado State University at Fort Collins, have concluded that humanity was seeded by an extraterrestrial race a nd that the Anunn aki were reptilian. He,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 147 too, believes that these same Reptilians have c ontrolled the world for thou sands of years, as he e xplains in his book, Human ity's Extraterrestrial Origins. 5R The Illuminati use reptilian and Anunn aki symbo lism all the time, as you can see in The Biggest Secret and Children o f the Matrix, and remember how Jay Gamer and Zalmay Khalilzad ho sted a meeting o f Ir aqi groups in the shadow of the 4,OOO-year-old ziggurat at Ur, the stepped-pyramid temple of the a ncient Sumerians? Ur was a major centre for the Anunn aki and the ziggurat is believed by some to b e a place where comm unication and interbreeding took place with hu mans. What a c oincidence that the Illuminati-controlled American gov ernment shou ld choo se such a location for their first conference a fter Iraq was occupied. The themes of the Sumerian Tablets are suppo rted by Credo Mutwa, one of only two surviving 'Sanusi' left in southern Africa. A Sanusi is the peak o f the African shamanistic stream. Credo is in his eighties and the other Sanusi, his aunt, is in h er nineties. He is the official historian and storyteller of the Zulu n ation and the very n ame \"Zulu\" means \"People from the Stars\" beca use they b elieve they were seeded by an extraterrestrial 'royal' race. I think many extraterrestrial group s have been involved in seeding human race s for aeons and this has given us the diversity o f forms. With no on e for him to p ass on h is knowledge, and the urgent need for everyon e to kno w the a stonishing information h e has received in a lifetime of initiations, I produ ced v ideos with him called The Reptili an Agenda. They run more than six hou rs and still that is only a fraction o f the kno wledge he holds. In the videos he reveals what he once pledged in his initiations never to reveal, but he says the situation for humanity is s o p erilous that it is far more important for them Figu re 26 : The ne cklace fea tures a non -human figure with a ·come-and -ge t-me· pe nis tha t fits into the ea rth woman .

This information went und erground when the Europeans invaded Africa a nd their Illuminati leaders, in Credo's words, \"milked the minds of the shamans and then k illed them\". It was s uicide to talk openly o f such things and secret networks of initiation were formed to k eep it alive. Credo, who h as become a great friend, tells the same story o f the interbreeding b etween the e xtraterrestrial Anunn aki and hu mans to p roduce a hyb rid race . He has artefacts like the \"Necklace of the Mysteries\","},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 148 which confirm this s tory (Figu res 25,26 and 27 ). It is an extremely h eavy copp er 'necklace ' that actually rests on the shou lders and it has been mentioned in records 500 y ears old. Credo says it goes back at least 1,000 y ears. The large symbols that hang from the necklace tell the story o f humanity. In p ride of place a t the front are an extraterrestrial with a big copp er willy and an Earth woman into whom the ET 'fits', if you follow me. This is s ymbo lic, Credo explains, of the union b etween the people from the stars and the people of the planet. You find the same theme recorded in v irtually every ancient culture. Sign ificantly, he says the copp er willy was once made of gold b efore it was s tolen and replace d with copp er. This mirrors the a ncient Egyp tian story abou t the golden p enis of their key go d, Osiris, which is s ymbolised by the secret societies today, especially the Freemasons, as an ob elisk. The way the e xtraterrestrial is portrayed on the necklace , Credo says, is merely symbolic beca use these 'god s' were of a very d istinct and unh uman form (reptilian) and they warned the people of instant death if they ever depicted them as they really looked. How often we can ob serve in religious texts the theme of \"God (the god s) must not be seen o r revealed\". Thus the 'god s' were portrayed symbolically. Hanging from the Necklace of the Mysteries is a large hand, full of symbols. Among these is the a ll-seeing eye, which symbo lises, Credo says, the \"Watchers\" (the same as the Illuminati image on the US dollar bill); there is also the c onstellation o f Orion, which modem researchers have c onstantly conn ected with extraterrestrial activity on Earth; and there is a Star of David, so associated with \"King David\" (Psusennes II) and no w on the flag o f Is-ra-el. As some Jewish h istorians have stated, it is an ancient symbol found all over the world and o nly b eca me c losely associated with the Jewish faith when the banking and Illuminati blood line dyn asty, the Rothschilds or Redshields, began to u se it in the eighteenth century. The Necklace of the Mysteries includes a very clear 'flying saucer' which, the legend says, the e xtraterrestrials flew from their giant 'Mothership' to land on the Earth. They say the Mothership continued to o rbit and it was to there that the leaders sheltered du ring the uph eavals of the Great Flood . This is exactly what the Sumerian Tablets s ay. In France, cave paintings dated to b etween 10 ,000 and 30 ,000 years ago include oval and disc-shaped ob jects s tanding on tripod legs with ladders coming do wn from them. A drawing carved in a c liff at Fergania in Central Asia had a man who appeared to b e wearing an \"airtight helmet\" with some mechanical device on h is back. It was dated to 7000 Be. Whatever 'the origii1 and n ature of 'flying saucers' and o ther such craft, they h ave been seen aha recorded for thou sands of years.

In Credo's Africa these Reptilians are kno wn as the Chitauri, which translates as \"Children o f the Serpent\" or \"Children o f the Python \". This is s o close to the Central American term, \"people of the Serpent\". Africa, like e very o ther continent, is awash with the legend o f the serpent race. Credo Mutwa talks for hou rs on the videos, The Reptili an Agenda, abou t the background and history o f the Chitauri. He describes how the Earth was once e ncircled by a ca nopy o f water vapou r (the \"firmament\") that was destroyed in a ca taclysm. This water vapou r protected the planet from the harsh effects of the Sun, and the whole planet was moist and humid and h ad a c onstant temperature. It was a place of enormous abund ance a nd v ast forests. This is a comm on d escription o f the pre-cataclysmic 'Golden Age' or the Lemurian/ Muan 'Garden o f Eden' in the Pacific Ocea n. But, he says, when the Chitauri destroyed this canopy (symbolised by the Biblical 40 d ays and 40 nights of rain) the whole c limate c hanged as the Sun's rays baked on ce green and abund ant lands, like Egypt, and b egan to form the deserts. Scientists agree that Egyp t, now part of the Sahara Desert, was once a green and p leasant land. This was in the days when Egyp t was 'Khemit'. The story could explain the water erosion found on the Sphinx (which h as a face of a woman, not a man). To d ivide a nd rule the people, Credo continues, the Chitauri scattered them across the Earth and g ave them different langu ages s o they could no t communicate with eac h o ther.

That was taken from many more a ncient accoun ts. The Native American Hopi tribe in Arizona say that when they came to the surface of the Earth on the orders of \"Spider Woman\", a \"mocking bird\" arrived to confuse their language a nd make the tribes talk in different tongu es. Credo, repeating the information passed on to h im in a lifetime of initiations into this underground k nowledge, said the Chitauri Reptilians interbred with all race s to create the reptilian-mamm alian h ybrids through which they rule. He said that in African culture a person's genealogy is very important and that the 'royal' blood lines of the kings of black Africa c laimed d escent from the same 'god s' as the white 'royalty' across the world. He said that these black royal bloodlines (like those in the c oun tries of the 'West') had large1f moved ou t of the positions of inherited control, the kings and qu eens, where they could b e identified. Instead they h ave taken the positions of 'appointed' or 'elected' control, like gov ernment administrators, bankers, businessmen and political ' ~ _ leaders. He reveals, from his knowledge of black African g enealogy , that many black presidents who came to po wer after 'independence' from the white Europeans have been the same royal bloodlines J as the kings and qu eens of black Africa. He c ited Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe a s an example - the same Robert Mugabe who was manipulated into power by the Illuminati's Henry Kissinger and British Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, as explained in And The Truth S hall Set You Free.

This is typ ical of the bloodline's behaviour. Recurring story In the late nineteenth century, Colonel James Churchward, an ardent researcher into the e xistence of Mu o r Lemuria, says he was s hown some a ncient tablets in the secret vault of a monastery in no rthern India. They told the. story o f how the Naacals or Naga Mayas (\"serpents\") fr om the c ontinent of Lemuria-Mu h ad travelled to Ind ia via Burma to establish a c olony there. Churchward pu t the texts together in y ears of painstaking work and revealed ho w they d escribed the destruction o f Mu, the Motherland, and ho w the Naga Mayas or Nagas had travelled to India. 59 The Vedic scholar David Frawley explains how the a ncient indu ho ly book s, the Vedas, reveal that the earliest royal blood lines of India, the priest-kings, descend from the Bhrigus who arrived from a place ac ross the sea. The Bhrigus were a n o rder of adepts initiated into the ancient kno wledge. Frawley says in his book, God s, Sages, And Kings: Vedic Secrets Of Ancient Civilization,60 that the monarchs of these blood lines included the \"Serpent King \" Nahusha. They expanded into the five tribes that pop ulated a large part of the Indian po pu lation James Churchward wrote a number of book s on the c ivilisation o f Mu and h e says the Nagas also pop ulated China, Tibet and p arts of Asia. The Naga Maya people, with their mother godd ess religion, were a lso the origin o f the Maya people of Mexico. Researcher Michael Mott writes in Caverns, Cauldrons, And Concealed Creatures: \"The Nagas are described a s a very advanced race o r species, with a h ighly-developed technology. They also ha rbor a d isdain for human be ings, whom they are said to a bduct, t orture, interbreed with, and even to eat. The interbreeding ha s s upposedly led to a wide variety of forms, ranging from completely reptilian to nearly-human in a ppearance. Among their many devices are 'death rays' and 'vimana', or flying, disk- shap ed a erial craft. These craft are de scribed a t leng th in many ancient Vedic texts, including the Bhaga vad-Gita and the Ramayana . The Naga race is related to a nother underworld race, the Hindu demons, or Rakshasas. They also po ssess, as individuals, 'magical stone s', or a 'third e ye' in the middle of their brows, known to many s tuden ts of eastern mysticism toda y as a focal point for one of the h igher chakras, or energy c hannel-points, of the hu man(oid) nervous sys tem - the chakra a ssociated with 'inner visions', intuition, and o ther esoteric c oncepts.\" 62 For Nagas and Chitauri, read Anunn aki. Different names, same origins. The dragon kings and queens The theme of ruling 'royal' families and emperors who claim descent and their right to rule from the \"serpent god s\", can b e found across the ancient world. These bloodlines and conn ections were symbolised by royal emblems in the form of a dragon , snake, sphinx, plumed serpent or the tree-cross or Ankh . In Egyp t they h ad an o rder called the Djedhi (Jedi?) and the Dj meant serpent. 63 Thus we have pharaohs of the serpent line ca lled Djer, Djoser and Djederfra. The Royal Court of the Dragon was established in Egypt in 2170 BC und er Ankh fnkhonsu, and more formally by Queen Sobeknefru in 17 83 BC , to p rovide a n institution for the pursuit of the work o f the Dragon o f al-Khem who is best kno wn as Thoth o r Hermes.64 From al-Khem we get alchemy, the 'Great Work' of the Dragon . Note that the date of 1783 BC was around the period when the Hyksos appeared in Egyp tian history. The most famous book s attributed to Thoth are The Emerald Tablets and The Pymander. The Emerald Tablets of Thoth talk abou t reptiles, specifically shapeshifters, who seek to control the world, as we shall see later. I have mentioned the way that crocodile fat, or messeh, was used in the c oronation o f pharaohs and this beca me part of Celtic mytho logy also. The image of Messeh evolved to b ecome a Dragon , the e mblem of kingship.65 Messeh, the holy crocodile, evolved into what we kno w as Sobek in Egyp t, the c rocodile god, who was Suchos in Greek. 66 The Royal Court of the Dragon continues to this day and is promoted by Sir Laurence Gardner, the a uthor of a number of book s abou t the 'royal bloodline', which, he says, is the bloodline of Jesus. He ca lls it t he \"dragon bloodline\" .. In India, the Budd hist text, the Mahauyu tpatti, lists 80 kings who d escended from the Nagas or \"Serpent Kings\". Hindu legend says that the Nagas could take a human o r reptilian form at will, what is called shape- shifting. This is also a trait of the Chitauri acc ording to Credo Mutwa a nd I shall detail shortly some of the many experiences people have had in the modern world o f this phenomena. The serpent 'sea' or 'fish' god s of Sumer and Babylon were said to b e a ble to change shape a nd look hu man whenever they chose. Shape- shifting is a c omm on theme. Across India the rulers claimed po wer beca use they d escended from the Nagas, who were described as offspring from the interbreeding o f humans with the serpent god s. Accoun ts in the Indian epics also refer to ho w the reptilian Nagas intermingled with the white peoples and although their relationship was often on e of conflict and distrust, the two interbred, the e pics report, to p roduce a reptilian-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 151 mamm al hybrid that beca me ... the Aryan k ings. These serpent bloodlines became the 'Divine' royal bloodlines or 'demi-gods'. The Chinese e mperors were the same. They were kno wn as Lung o r Dragon s and many o f the ea rliest emperors were depicted with reptilian features, very much like the Nagas. They were described as part human, part serpent. One of them, called Huang Ti, was s aid to h ave been bo rn with a \"dragon -like coun tenance\". It was claimed that he was conceived by a ray o f golden light that entered h is .. mother's womb from the Big Dipper constellation. 6b The Big Dipper includes the star Alpha Draconis, the star of the Egyp tian g od, Set. Alpha Draconis is an alleged ho me of the reptilian 'royalty', the e lite leadership, known as the \"Draco\". One Chinese legend says that when he died Huang Ti transformed into an etheric dragon and flew to the realm of the immortals. In Media, now Turkey, the Iranians knew their kings as Mar, which means s nake in Persian. They were ca lled the \"Dragon Dynasty o f Media\" or \"descendants of the dragon \". The e arliest of the royal bloodlines of Central America c laimed g enetic descent from the serpent god s, Quetzalcoatl and Itzamna. The priest kings of the Peruvian Incas were symbolised by the snake a nd they wore bracelets and anklets in the image of a snake. In the Mycenaean age in Greece, the kings were, in the words of author Jane Harrison, \"regarded as being in some sense a snake\".69 Cecrops, the first Mycenaea n king of Athens, was depicted as a human with a serpent tail. Another, Erectheus, who found ed the Eleusinian Mystery School, was worshipped as a live snake a fter his death and, acc ording to legend, King Kadmus s hape-shifted ,into a live snake when h e died. 70 The Sumerian accoun ts tell of flying serpents and dragon s breathing fire (symbolic of their aerial craft?) and ho w the kings of Sumer, going b ack long b efore the deluge to some 240,000 BC , were \"changelings\" seeded by the union o f the god s and h umans. Sargon the Great, that famous ruler of the Sumer / Akkadian Empire, claimed this genetic origin. The very existence of \"kingship\" is reported in the Sumerian Tablets to h ave been a gift of these god s. Equally clear is that they were reptilian g ods with the many references by the Sumerians to their god s as fiery, winged serpents. The a ncient world abou nds with stories of the serpent or dragon race a nd royal kings, queens and emperors who claim their right to rule through their descent from the serpent god s. The kings of the succession in the reptilian bloodlines were kno wn as \"Dragon s\". When many k ingdoms joined together in b attle, or as a group o f kingdoms, they appointed a king o f kings. These were kno wn as the Great Dragon o r ... Draco. I found direct references to this theme in the Indian (formerly Indus Valley) works, like the Book o f Dzyan, one of the oldest of Sanskrit acc oun ts, and the e pics, Mahabharata a nd the Ramayana. The Book o f Dzyan tells of how a reptilian race it calls the Sarpa or Great Dragon s carne from the skies to b ring civilisation to the world. A deluge, the Biblical Great Flood, ended the Golden Age, it says, but the serpent god s s urvived and returned to rule. They are described symbolically as having the face of a human, but the tail of a dragon .71 Their leader was called the Great Dragon and the Illuminati's Ku Klux Klan, created by that infamous Freemasonic 'god ' in America, Albert Pike, still uses the term Grand Dragon today. The Celtic title of Pend ragon , as in Uther Pendragon , the father of \"King Arthur\" in the Grail stories, was also a version o f this. Pendragon = \"Great Dragon \". In the legends, the symbo lic Arthur was a descendant of the dragon s and h is helmet carried a dragon motif. The red d ragon symbol of Wales comes from the c laim by Merlin, Arthur's \"magician\", that the red d ragon symbolised the people of Britain. Merlin was described as only h alf human b eca use he was the c hild o f an und erground b eing and a human woman. The Arthurian stories include a ll the c lassic e lements of the theme, includ ing the c reation o f royal blood lines through the interbreeding b etween hu mans and non -human entities, shape-shifting, the use of holograph ic images to hide a being's true form and b attles between competing d ragon s. Geoffrey o f Monmouth, the twelfth century h istorian, said that Merlin's earlier name had b een \"Ambrosius\", thus possibly associating him with the Greek term for menstrual blood, Ambrosia, which the Reptilians love to d rink.72 There is also the theme of the \"Lady o f the Lake\" and this conn ects with the stories of godd ess-worshipping serpent peoples like the Nagas living in u nderground centres located und er lakes and lochs. Like the Celtic myth and folklore, the a ncient Greek culture was inspired by the Sumerians and Egyp tians and the e arlier Atlanteans and Lemurians and was based almost entirely on their stories and myths und er different names. Through out the Sumer Empire the people worshipped serpent god s and as the Reverend John Bathhu rst Deane wrote in his book, The Worship of the Serpent: \" ... One o f [the] five bu ilders of Thebes [in Egypt] was named after the serpent-god of the Phoenicians, Of hi on ... The firSt altar erected to Cyclops at Athen s was to 'Ops', the serpent deity ... The symbolic worship of the serpent was s o comm on in Greece that Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing it into the mysteries of all their gods.\" 73 The Merovingian b loodline One of the key hu man-reptilian 'royal' bloodlines later became kno wn as the Merovingians, who were kno wn as s orcerers or \"priest kings\", just as the pharaohs were in Egyp t. The Merovingians were the royal line of a people known as the Sicambrian Franks. Francio, who g ave his name to the Franks and d ied in 11"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 152 BC , claimed to b e a descendent of Noah (Sumer). The Franks called themselves Newmage or \"the People of the Covenant\". The Egyp tians also b elieved they were the c hosen p eople a nd h ad a c ovenant with God, a theme transposed by po st-Babylonian Levite scribes to the Egyp tian 'Israelites'. But for 'God' read reptilian 'god s'. The Merovingians/Franks can also trace their bloodline from ancient Troy and the Trojan Wars, up through the Caucasus Moun tains into what is now France, a land to which they g ave their name. Once a gain the Caucasus, this blood line melting pot, was invo lved. At one time the Sicambrian Franks settled in an area west of the Danub e a nd were kno wn as the Scythians, whom the Romans called \"the genuine ones\". Figu re 31 : The state sea l of Utah d omina ted by the beehive. the an cien t symbol of the Meroving ian b loodline tha t crea ted the Mormon 'Chu rch' Legend says that Merovee, the found er of the Merovingians, who died in 458 AD , was seeded by a reptile and this bloodline is related to every royal family in Europe a nd a stream of others in po sitions of influence and control. The foun ding n ames of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young were both Merovingian bloodline a nd that's why the Mormon-controlled state of Utah h as a beehive a t the ce ntre of its seal (Figure 31). The bee or beehive is an ancient symbol of the Meroving ian bloodline, as is the fleur-de- lis, so b eloved o f British Merovingian royalty. The hive is the symbo l of the queen b ee, the Illuminati reptilian g oddess at the heart of their symbolism, and it also relates to the 'hive' mentality o f the Reptilians that they h ave been seeking to transfer to hu mans. The Greek d eity Zeus was depicted as an eagle (pho enix?) and a serpent to whom offerings of hon ey were made and this is a possible c onn ection to the Merovingian b ee symbol.74 The themes of the serpent and hon ey can b e linked to the 'Tribe of Dan', which is claimed to b e one of the ten lost tribes of Israel. But are they really lost or did they n ever exist in the form portrayed by Levite 'history'? The Tribe of Dan also u sed the symbols of the serpent and the ea gle a nd I have written abou t them at some length in The Biggest Secret. I do no t believe they are the Israelites of the Bible. Genesis s ays that the Danites did no t have a kno wn g enealogy and were not related to the ea rly Israelites. 75 They were a sea-faring p eople (the Danun a or Denyen to the Egyp tians) and many settled in northern Europe. The names of Denmark (Danmark), the River Danub e a nd Ireland's Tuatha de Danann o r \"People of the Goddess Danu\", would seem to b e e xpressions of the Danites and this is one reason why there is s uch a North African influence in Irish history. The Egyp t-Sumer-conn ected Phoenicians made the same sea journeys as the Danites and they were a lmost certainly the same people. The Danite c olours were red and white, just li ke the Phoenicians, and these a re the c olours of the Knights Templar that has its famous red cross on the white background displayed as the flag o f England o r the Flag o f St George. This is a Phoenician d eity called George of Cappadocia in what is now Turkey, the same c oun try as Troy. Another strand o f the Oanite-Phoenicians beca me the Meroving ians and, it is s uggested by some researchers, the Khazars in the Caucasus. The works of the Greek po et, Homer, who lived around the 9th o r 8th century BC , are the main source of information abou t ancient Troy and the conflicts that led to its demise. The two epics the Iliad and the Odyssey are ascribed to h im and modern archaeological discoveries have c onfirmed the a ccuracy o f Homer's work. According to the Iliad, the found er of Troy was named Dardanus, who was said to b e the son o f the god Zeus. Not surprising ly then that the symbols of Zeus and the Danites, the serpent, eagle a nd b ees are the same. Dardanus had a son named Erichthon ius and his s on was named Tros, who g ave his name to the Trojans and their capital city, Troy, from whom the bee-symboled Merovingians claim descent. (Trois is the French word for \"three\" and"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 153 this is an extremely important number to the Illuminati, as in the Babylon ian Trinity, and this is symbolised in the three-pointed fleur-de-lis, a symbol of the Merovingian bloodline a nd, therefore, the British royal family). Tros had a son called Assaracus and a prince of the royal hou se of Assaracus is credited with founding the Roman Empire. His name was Aeneas and we will see shortly that this guy is massively important to the Illuminati blood line. The Merovingians are a ssociated with Arcadia in Greece , home of the Spartans, one of the protagon ists in the Trojan Wars. Some Spartans migrated to Troy (in today's Turkey) and up into France, settling in the province of Lorraine. This is a long time major centre for the Illuminati Reptilian bloodlines. In the a pocryph al book 1 Macca bees, a letter fr om Areus, King o f Sparta, tells a Jewish High Priest that the Spartans are\" ... of the race of Abraham\".76 In o ther words - Egyp tian/Sumarian. The Spartan k ing's letter said that his s ymbol was an eagle holding a dragon in its claws/ 7 Here we go again. Fritz Springmeier, a long-time researcher of the Illuminati blood lines, refers to the Merovingians as the \"13th bloodline\" beca use it weaves its DNA through the other 12 major families. 78 It also most appropriate that the a ccoun ts of the Merovingian conn ected Trojan Wars involve the story o f the 'Trojan Horse' and you could no t have better symbolism of the way the blood lines infiltrate their target societies. The Merovingians were suppo sed to h ave died ou t long ago, but in reality on ly the name disappeared, until recently, and no t the bloodline. The genetics continued with the King o f the Franks called Charles, more famously kno wn as Charlemagne, to whom 34 o f the 43 US presidents and so many o ther key figures are related. He vastly extended the Frankish do mains and ruled as Emperor of the West in the papal empire created and controlled by the bloodlines descending from the Roman Empire. These in turn, descended from the royal lines of the Sumer Empire, Babylon and Egyp t, who d escended from the Atlanteans, Lemurians and the hyb rid interbreeding p rogramm es. Charlemagne was a c ontemporary o f the Khazars. The Priory o f Sion (\"Tsion \" in Hebrew means moun tain o r desert monu ment - Zion) claims to b e a n elite secret society created in the twelfth century to serve the Merovingian bloodline or \"Le Serpent Roug e\" (the serpent blood ). It says it was very closely conn ected to the Knights Templar who were officially formed at the French city o f Troyes, named by the Sicambrian Franks (Merovingians) after their former home in Troy. Prince Paris from the Trojan Wars stories also inspired the name of the French capital city. Another of the key figures in Illuminati genealogy is Alexander the Great, an ancestor of Charlemagne a nd all the major Illuminati families today. Alexander descended from the Viking p eoples who settled the Mediterranean and the Aegean after the c ataclysms and may well have become the white peoples of the region, including the Danites. Alexander ruled Troy at one stage a nd, before he died in Babylon in 3 23 BC at the age of 33, his army h ad seized control of an enormous region on ce ruled from Sumer. This included Egyp t, Mesopo tamia and into India. He found ed the c ity o f Alexandria in Egypt and, as he was kno wn as the \"Serpent's Son\", Alexandria beca me the \"City o f the Serpent's Son\".79 Once a gain we see the recurring theme. The legend goes that Alexannr's real father was the serpent god , Ammon, and this mirrors the story o f Merovee, found er of the Meroving ian dyn asty, of whom a similar origin is given. The Meroving ians have been linked with the blood line of 'Jesus' by a number of book s, not least those by Royal Court of the Dragon p romoter, Sir Laurence Gardner. But the 'Jesus' conn ection isn't nece ssary to make the link b etween the \"dragon bloodlines\" of Egypt and Sumer and the Memving ians beca use they were transported to the Mediterranean region, Asia Minor /Turkey and elsewhere long b efore the e ra associated with 'Jesus'. The Illuminati are not going to h ave only on e strand o f the blood line that is s o important to them. The 'Jesus' bloodline is only code for the Babylonian/Serpent bloodline, anyway. Throughou t history, the Reptilians have perpetuated their 'purest' bloodlines by marrying as closely as possible to their own g enetics and through the secret breeding p rogramm es. It is important to remember that these bloodlines do no t just breed through their official partners. They h ave stunn ing n umbers of children out of wedlock. These offspring are then b rough t up with n ames that are different to the major Illuminati families like Rockefeller and Rothschild. So when on e of these c hildren, called Clinton, Roosevelt or whoever, enters a position o f power, the people do no t relate them to the e lite families beca use they have a different name. But, and I can't emphasise this enoug h, they are the same blood line. This is how they h ide the tribe, the reptilian g enetic network. Insider confirmation Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, who now lives in America, claims to b e a n uno fficial offspring o f Philippe de Rothschild o f the French Rothschilds, and worked within the Illuminati Satanic network for most of his life. Phillip told me that the key 'Nefilim' bloodline is conn ected to that figure ca lled Aeneas, the a lleged inspiration o f the Roman Empire through his descendants, Romulus and Remus. The latter are c ode names for the blood line a nd no t real people a nd that may b e the same with Aeneas. The legends of Aeneas fit with the c odes and themes of the Illuminati bloodlines, including his association with Troy. Aeneas is s aid to have been bo rn in Troy, the c ity sacred to the Merovingians and the Knights Templar. In the Hymn to Aphrodite, the goddess proclaims that Aeneas, the son she has conceived by the mortal Anchises, will come"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 154 to rule the Trojans, as will the generations upon g enerations that succeed h im.80 In Homer's Iliad, Aeneas recoun ts his birth and ancestry to h is oppon ent Achilles on the battlefield at Troy. Aeneas says that he descends from \"Divine a nd immortal stock\" through bo th his mother and h is father. This conn ection between Divine imm ortality and the Anunnaki under their various names constantly recurs in ancient acc oun ts. Aeneas says that his mother is the goddess, Aphrodite, and his father is Anchises, and h e can trace his lineage back to Dardanus, the son o f Zeus and legendary found er of the Trojan race . Aeneas is endo wed in the Iliad with a c lose relationship with the god s. The legends of Aeneas are peppered with references and codes abou t his genealogical conn ection to the 'god s' and it is no surprise that he plays s uch an important part in the c odes and symbolism of the Illuminati blood lines today .Phillip Eugene de Rothschild told me that this' Aeneas' bloodline beca me what he ca lled the \"Rothsburg dynasty\" - the union o f the Bauer- Rothschilds (same family, different name) and the Battenbergs. This is the Merovingian bloodline a nd also the line of the Habsburgs, the leading family in the Holy Roman Empire for hund reds of years that again uses the symbol of the ea gle, which follows the bloodline. The Greeks, Romans, Germans, French, Czarist Russia, the United States and many more have a ll displayed the symbo l of the ea gle/pho enix. The Habsburg's Holy Roman Empire was the medieval state that embraced most of central Europe a nd Italy from 962 to 1806 . Philli p Eugene says that this \"Rothsburg\" blood line is kno wn within the Illuminati as the \"Gens\". This is a Latin word meaning \"race \", \"tribe\" or \"male line of descent\" and comes from the term gignere - \"to b eget\". The late Lord Louis Moun tbatten, a famous member of the British royal family, and his nephew, Prince Philip, are Battenbergs. It was Lord Moun tbatten who arranged the marriage between Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II, after which the royal line of the UK became kno wn as Windsor- Moun tbatten. Both the Windsors and the Moun tbattens are German b lood lines formerly kno wn as the House of Saxe-Cobu rg-Gotha a nd the Battenbergs. They anglicised their names during the First World War against Germany for public relations reasons, but both o f these 'fc1milies' suppo rted the Nazis, and Prince Philip was sent to a schoo l in Germany run by the Nazi youth p rogramm e (see And The Truth Sha ll Set You Free and The Biggest Secret). Phillip Eugene, the Rothschild o ffspring, says of this' Aeneas' bloodline: \"Appa rently Aeneas embodies all the various blood lines that must trace their lineage back through Charlemagne because in h im is embod ied the confluence o f the lineage o f both David (Jewish[Egyptian]) and Alexander the Great (Aryan). It is the modern day representatives of these Roman 'Gens' or European monarchs that make up the ruling 'aristocracy' of the revived Roman Empire. These 'royal' families maintain their pedigree through en dogamy (inter-familial marriages). The first prototype of the Antichrist [t he p urest bloodline] was Nimrod, founder of Babylon. The h istorical and seminal nexus of this last Roman Empire is Charlemagne and h is descendants, peop le like [Prince] Philip Mountbatten (Rex Julius Alexander Battenb erg) who is one of the ruling h eads of the Julian Gens.\" 81 Dracula = Draco As I have detailed in other book s, the Illuminati bloodlines are seriously into human sacrifice a nd b lood drinking ritual and h ave been throug hout their existence. They p erform the same rituals today as they d id in Babylon, their ancient headqu arters after the demise of Sumer, although I think there was a much earlier version o f Babylon, also. The story o f Dracula originates from this theme. It was written by the Irish author Bram Stoker and pub lished in 1897 . Stoker probably kn ew the score after years of research into the coun tless vampire legends. As a History Channel documentary abou t Stoker confirmed, there is no p art of the world and no era of history that does not have its myths and legends abou t vampires who feed o ff other people's energy and b lood. Dracula c ontains all the familiar themes. His name is Dracula (the Draco are claimed to b e the 'royal' reptilian bloodlines); he is called \"Coun t\" Dracula (symbolic of the way these Draco b loodlines have been carried by 'human' royalty and aristocracy); he 'shape-shifts' (like the Reptilians) and h e is a vampire (symbolic of the need o f the Draco Reptilians to d rink human blood and feed o ff human energy, as I shall detail shortly). Many famous writers and artists were initiates or dogg ed researchers who told elements of the story through art and 'fiction'. Stoker's character was largely b ased on a man called Dracula or Vlad the Impaler, the fifteenth century ruler of a c oun try called Wallachia, not far from the Black Sea in what is now Romania (Rom = Reptilian blood lines). This region was once called Transylvania, the home of the most famous vampire legends. The Danub e River valley, which runs from Germany to Romania a nd into the Black Sea, comes up v ery o ften in the history o f the bloodlines. These were once the lands of the Khazars and so many strands of the Illuminati blood lines have passed through here, including the Merovingians. Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula, slaughtered tens of thou sands of people a nd impaled many o f them on stakes. He would sit down to eat amid this forest of dead bod ies, dipp ing his bread in their blood . He usually h ad a Borse a ttached to each o f the victim's legs and a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body. The end o f the stake was oiled and care was taken that the stake not be too sharp; he didn't want the victim dying"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 155 too q uickly from shock. Infants were often impaled on the stake forced through their mothers' chests. The records indicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake. Death by impalement was s low and p ainful. Victims s ometimes endu red for hou rs or days. Dracula had the stakes arranged in v arious geometric patterns and the most comm on was a ring o f concentric c ircles. The height of the spear indicated the rank o f the victim, an excellent indication o f the ritual-obsessed Reptilian mind. The deca ying corpses were often left there for months. It was once reported that an invading Turkish army turned b ack in fright when it encoun tered thou sands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the Danub e. In 1461 , Mohammed II, the c onqu eror of Constantinople, a man no t noted for his s queamishness, was sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses rotting outside of Dracula's capital of Tirgoviste. The warrior sultan turned ov er comm and o f the ca mpaign against Dracula to subo rdinates and returned to Constantinople. Ten thou sand were impaled in the Transylvanian city o f Sibiu, where Dracula had on ce lived. On St Bartholomew's Day, 145 9, Dracula had thirty thousand merchants and o thers impaled in the Transylvanian city o f Brasov. One of the most famous wood cuts of the period shows Dracula feasting among st a forest of stakes and their grisly bu rdens outside Brasov while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims. Impalement was Dracula's favou rite technique, but by no means his only method o f inflicting unimaginable horror. The list of tortures employed by this deeply sick man included n ails in h eads, cutting off limbs, blinding, strangulation, burning, cutting o ff noses and ears, mutilation o f sexual organs (especially in the ca se of women), scalping, skinning, expo sure to the e lements or wild animals, and bo iling alive. No on e was imm une to Dracula's attentions. His victims included women and children, peasants and great lords, ambassadors from foreign po wers and merchants. Vlad the Impaler was the son o f Vlad Dracul, who was initiated into the a ncient Order of the Dragon by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1431. Its emblem was a dragon , wings extended, hanging on a c ross. Father Vlad wore this emblem and his coinage bore the dragon symbol. All the members of the order had a dragon on their coat of arms and h e was nicknamed Dracul (the Devil or the Dragon ). Son Vlad signed his name Draculea or Draculya or the \"Devil's Son\" and this later beca me Dracula, a name that translates as something like \"Son o f Him who h ad the Order of the Dragon \". Most appropriate. The a ncient Order of the Dragon b egan in Egypt and expanded through the period o f the Hyksos kings whose symbol was the snake. This is the same Dragon Order that is today p romoted by the British 'Holy Grail' author, Sir Laurence Gardner. By the way, Queen Mary o r Mary o f Teck, the mother of King George VI and therefore grandmother to the present Elizabeth II, was descended from a sister of \"Dracula\". These a re the blood lines and the mentality that seek to conqu er the world today. That's why they h ave no compassion o r empathy with the suffering, death and d estruction they cause. Thinking reptilian Against this background o f the reptilian conn ection, if you study the reptilian mind y ou can und erstand bo th the behaviour of the Illuminati across the ce nturies and the global society they are creating. They h ave distinct character traits and they are, seeking to make humans the same. The most ancient part of the human brain is kno wn by scientists as the R-complex o r \"reptilian b rain\" (Figu re 32). It is the most obvious remnant of our reptilian g enetic history. Most people have no idea of the reptilian h eritage of the human body and its influence on ou r behaviour. Scientists s ay that the reptilian b rain represents a core of the nervou s s ystem, and look at the c haracter traits of the reptilian b rain as agreed by scientists. I quo te here from an Internet article by Skip Largent: \"At least five hu man beha viours originate in the reptilian b rain. Withou t defining them, I shall simply s ay that in hu man a ctivities they find e xpression in: obsessive compulsive beha viour; personal day-to-day rituals and supe rstitious acts; slavish conformance to o ld ways of doing things; ceremonial re-enactments; obe isance to p receden t, as in legal, religious, cultural, and o ther matters and a ll manner of deceptions.\" 82 Add to that the other traits of the reptilian b rain such as cold blooded b ehaviour with no empathy with the victims of your actions; 'territoriality' - controlling the world around you; an ob session with hierarchical structures of rule a nd control; aggression; and the idea that might is right, winner takes all. What you h ave in those c haracter traits of the reptilian b rain are the very characteristics displayed by the Illuminati and their agents for thou sands of years. You could no t describe them better. Racism comes from the reptilian brain and the a ggressive, violent sex that the Illuminati bloodlines indulge in big time - ask Father Bush, Cheney, President Gerald Ford and o ther Illuminati names I expo se in my bo oks. Can it really b e a coincidence that the Illuminati manifest the c lassic traits of the reptilian b rain- while, at the same time, the evidence moun ts that they are reptilian bloodlines? Cosmologist Carl Sagan, who kn ew far more than h e"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 156 was telling, wrote a book called Tile Dragons of Eden 83 to h ighlight the reptilian influences on humanity. He said: \"It does no go od whatsoever to igno re the reptilian component of human nature, particularly ou r ritualistic a nd hierarchical behaviour. On the c ontrary, the model may h elp u s und erstand what human b eings are really abou t.\" Other areas of the human b rain b alance the e xtremes of the reptilian characteristics in most people, but they can still be seen, for instance, in those who live their lives as a daily ritual repeating the same c ycles over and ov er week after week. The Illuminati have sough t to turn society into a c lockwatching, ever- repeating cycle, beca use that locks the people into their reptilian level of perception and further activates the reptilian b rain. Those with the most dominant reptilian g enetics, the Illuminati, obviously express more of the c haracteristics associated with the reptilian b rain and this is why the Illuminati are utterly ob sessed with ritual.

This chapter was already finished. The book was called Blue Blood, True Blood 84 and contained information about the reptilian blood line that matched so much o f my o wn research and my o wn feelings abou t what is going on. Once a gain, I don 't nece ssarily agree with everything in the book, but in theme it matches my o wn v iew very closely. The a uthor is Stewart Swerdlow w ho says he was one of the few survivors of the Illuminati mind control and g enetics programm es at Montauk on Long Island, New Y ork. As a young ster Stewart was kidnapped at night by what he though t were extraterrestrials and taken to Montauk. He later learned that his kidnappers were military o fficials posing as ET s - this has been a c omm on ruse to h ide the truth o f who is doing the a bdu cting. He was forced into the Montauk g enetic e xperiment program and h e found out much later that he was among on ly on e per cent who go t out alive. During his years und er Illuminati control, Stewart says that he learned abou t the a genda for global control and the non -human entities behind it all. These e ntities, he writes, are reptilian. He says he saw reptilian b eings at Montauk and they \"seemed to pop in and ou t of physical reality\".85 The following is a summ ary o f what Stewart says he learned du ring the Montauk y ears and in his research and experiences s ince then. Many and v arious extraterrestrial groups have c ome to this planet and seeded the different races. Atlantis was dominated by a white or Caucasian p eople ca lled the Atlans. They were from the star system kno wn as Lyrae or Lyra while a reptilian race located on Mu o r Lemuria in the Pacific. The original Lyrians were not phy sical as we und erstand that word, but they b eca me trapped in this dimension and their vibrations beca me ever denser. They h ad b lond h air and blue e yes with the occasional red h air and g reen eyes. Credo Mutwa told me a bou t a tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed, extraterrestrial that Africans called the Mzungu . He said that when the white Europeans first arrived in South Africa the tribes people thought they were the returning Mzungu and called them by that name. You can see Credos painting o f the Mzungu in Figu re 33. The Reptilians, Swerdlow says, were c reated by those he c alls the \"transparent people\" who \"canno t really enter into the phy sical dimensions beca use their energy v ibratory rate is s o h igh that it canno t sustain a phy sical bod y\". When they appear, he says, \"It looks like a transparent glass s hell.\" 86 At first, the Reptilians were \"borderline phy sical\" and to function h ere they n eeded a phy sical form. This was achieved by mixing reptilian g enes with those of the Lyrians. This is why, as we shall see, the Reptilians are so ob sessed with blond and blue-eyed p eople - they n eed their genetics to op erate in this reality. There you h ave the reason why the deeply reptilian Windsors wanted the genes of blonde-haired, blue-eyed Princess Diana a nd discarded h er once they had them. Prince William is blond-haired and b lue-eyed while Prince Harry h as red hair. The Windsor line had b ecome so Reptilian with its interbreeding that it needed a massive infusion o f 'Lyrian' genes to maintain an apparently human form. The Reptilians were located in the Draco star system (hence \"Dracula\", Vlad Dracul and the word\" draconian\") and they b egan to expand across the galaxy by the sort of conqu ests we are e xperiencing on this planet. Stewart Swerdlow says they h ave been assisted in this by a race from Sirius, the brightest star seen from Earth. The Reptilians are programm ed to believe they are the superior form and b elieve themselves more \"God-like\" beca use they are a ndrogynou s. They h ave a programm ed . ~ mentality that wants to conqu er everything. The British and Roman Empires are examples of this at work. The fusing o f Reptilian g enes with those of the Lyrians and o thers is why hu mans have so much reptilian DNA , Swerdlow says, and why foetuses go through reptilian-type development in the womb on their way to becoming 'human'.51 The Reptilian-Lyrian h ybrids were designed to b e 'tuned' to the Reptilian frequencies and could, therefore, be c ontrolled by them. They wanted a 50-50 mix o f genetics beca use that would produ ce a body that looked hu man while being able to shape-shift into Reptilian. \"Shape-shifting was acc omplished simply by concentrating on the genetics the hyb rid wished to op en, or lock up , whatever the case may b e\", writes Swerdlow.88 This makes s ense of why Phillip Eugene de Rothschild said that the importance of Charlemagne to the Illuminati (34 o f the 43 American p residents go b ack to him) was that he embodied the mixture of the bloodline of 'King David' (Egyptian/Hyksos/Reptilian) and Alexander the Great (\"Aryan\"). When the genetic domination is too far to the Reptilian side it becomes impossible to h old human form and in these c ases they consume human ho rmones, flesh and b lood to compensate. Human sacrifice a nd b lood d rinking rituals have followed the bloodlines everywhere a nd this is why. Swerdlow says that the domesticated p ig was developed for this purpose a nd thus it is s o close to hu man g enetics. He also explains why royalty b eca me kno wn as the \"Bluebloods\": \"Their blood , because of the increased Reptilian DNA, contained more of a copper content. Since copper- based b lood turns blue-green u pon o xidizing, these Reptilian h ybrids were called 'Blueb loods'.\" 89  "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 158 Figu re 33 : A blond -haired. blue -eyed \"Mzun gu' pa inted by Credo Mutwa. The y loo k very much like the 'Lyrian s' tha t Stewart Swerdlow de scribes When Mu/Lemuria was destroyed, the survivors relocated to Northern India a nd inside the Earth where they built a massive und erground civilisation. I will present evidence of this later. They also re-launched their genetic takeover and the location they chose, says Swerdlow, was ... Sumer. He says the Sumerians beca me kno wn as the Sum-Aryans or simply Aryans and they expanded into North Africa, Central Asia, Northern India a nd the Steppes of Russia. \"The Aryan leaders, all Bluebloods, beca me the Sultans and Rajas of legend\", writes Swerdlow. 90 He says that when the Aryans mixed with the Dravidians (formerly from Lemuria) in India, they created the Hindu religion. \"The ca ste system of India is a direct copy o f the Reptilian division o f function\".91 Once a gain the importance of the Caucasus is confirmed: \" .. . [the Aryans] mostly established themselves in the Caucasus Mountains and [later] became the Khazars. From here, they s pread west towards Europe, seeding the na tional identities for the Vikings, the Franks, the Teutonic peoples and the Russians. Keep in mind that when Atlantis s ank, some o f those refugees went to western Europe a nd d eveloped into the Celts. Some went to Greece and o thers to the Italian Peninsula. These pe oples were he re b efore the h ybrids moved in ... These Blueblood leaders also infiltrated the Middle Eastern peop les, such a s the Biblical Canaanites, Malachites and Kittites.\" 92 So what did h appen in Egypt? This brings us to Egyp t and what really h appened with the Hyksos s tory. Swerdlow says, quite rightly, that the Egyp tians also b eca me kno wn as the Phoenicians and were descendents of Atlantis. This was also the Tribe of Dan, I would suggest. As 'Lyrians', they were blond e-haired and b lue-eyed with some that were green-eyed and red-haired. These were the people who located in the British Isles and the Americas as archaeological evidence a nd o ther finds have shown (see The Biggest Secret). The Sumer-Aryans infiltrated Egyp tian society and implanted their Reptilian blood line into the royal fan1'ilies of the pharaohs. So it is quite c orrect, at least symbolically, that\" Abraham\" is s aid to h ave c ome from the Sumer region that is now Iraq. At the same time it could also b e c orrect, as Ralph Ellis s ays, that the Hyksos \"Shepherd Kings\" or \"Leaders of Foreign Lands\" were a lready in Egyp t and did not invade. The Sumer infiltration b egan b efore the Hyksos period and it could well be that the time of royal and religious conflict was actually the battle for supremacy by the Reptilian Bluebloods in royal and religious affairs. The Hyksos symbol was the snake and their colour was red - highly sign ificant in Reptilian ritual. Remember, their kings wore the Red Crown. The Egyp tian ceremonial title of Moche means, \"He who is anointed with crocodile fat from the Nile River\".93 Swerdlow says the term \"Sun God\" was a Reptilian symbol and so was the lion. Both abound in ancient Egyp t, as they do in the Reptilian religions and royal families to this day. The Royal Court of the Dragon (also kno wn as The Brotherhood o f the Snake) was formed in Egypt to infiltrate the royal and religious centres of power. Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonic historian, summ arises what happened in Egyp t, although for \"black magicians of Atlantis\" read \"Reptilians\" who also infiltrated Atlantis: \"While the e laborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil, there a rose from its perversion several false schoo ls of sorcery, or black magic, [in Egypt] . .. the b lack magicians of Atlantis c ontinued to exercise their superhuman powers until they had completely undermined a nd corrupted the morals of the primitive Mysteries ... t hey usurped the position formerly occupied b y the initiates, and seized the reigns of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 159 spiritual go vernment. \"Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralysed the intellectual ~~ d spiritual activities of the individual by demanding h is c omplete and unhesitating a cquiescence in the d ogma formulated b y the priest craft. The Pharaoh be came a p uppet in the h ands of the Scarlet Council - a comm ittee o f arch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood.\" 94 Note \"Scarlet Coun cil\". This is what happened wherever the Blueblood Reptilians located. Babylon was a prime Reptilian centre, as I have been stressing all these years. It was the place where the Reptilian bloodlines organised the Blueblood blueprint for global conquest, not least through manufactured religions. Swerdlow w rites: \"Bab ylon was the civilization tha t Sumer de velop ed into as it expand ed into Central Asia to be come the Kha zars. In fact, many of the Blueb lood o rga nisations tha t de velop ed throu gh the millen nia called themselves Bab ylon Brotherhoods.

The family qu ickly too k c on trol of the finan cial and trade founda tions of Europe .\" 95 Babylon's modern expression is Lond on and this is referred to by some researchers as Babylon-don. The Babylon god and godd ess, Nimrod and Semiramis, were depicted as half-human, half-reptile, and to enter that Illuminati strong ho ld, the financial district called the City o f London, you p ass flying reptiles on bo th sides of the street. The City's emblem is two flying reptiles holding the Phoenician/Knights Templar symbol of the red cross on the white background (Figu res 34 and 35 , overleaf). This is s ymbolic of the mixed Reptilian/Sum-Aryan g enetics with the Reptilians in control. The British royal crest is a lion and a unicorn (Reptilian and Sum-Aryan) with the unicorn's horn representing the penis. It symbolises the two g enetics that come together to create the royal bloodline represented by the shield. The Reptilian control is emphasised by the unicorn always being tethered (see Figure 36). The crest of the Rothschild family is virtually identical (Figu re 37) and you can see a similar theme with the logo o f the truly appalling Christian television n etwork in the United States called Trinity Broadcasting, which also includes the symbol of the dov e - Babylon's Queen Semiramis (Figure 38). It is the same a s the beliefs of the Reptilian Nazis, who considered the Sum-Aryans to b e the \"Master Race\". Where the City o f Lond on meets the a rea called Temple Bar, named after the Knights Templar, there is another flying reptile in the ce ntre of the road (Figure 39). Temple Bar is the headqu arters of the global legal profession and this area, together with the City o f London, has more e lite secret societies per square mile than almost anywhere e lse on Earth. Stewart Swerdlow says that the Reptilians also d eveloped hyb rid blood lines with a race from Rigel in the Orion system that beca me the royal bloodlines of China a nd Japan and this is another reason why the Caucasus and Eastern Europe a re so significant. It was into this region that the 'Golden Horde' and o thers carne from the Far East to interbreed with the Sumer Reptilian 'royal' bloodlines to create a very important genetics from the Reptilian po int of view. Since those a ncient\" times, the blood lines and the Illuminati secret society n etwork through which they manipu late have worked to p lace their operatives into the positions of power over the pop ulation. As they expanded across the world, they u sed the same techniques of manipulation everywhere to increase their power over the people a nd no w they are seeking to complete their long-term goal- global control. These a re the bloodlines behind the World Wars; September 11th and the 'war on terrorism'; and all the needless s uffering, conflict and d epravation that we see ac ross the world. It doesn't have to b e like this. It is just that the Reptilians want it to b e.

As usual since the mound in Peru, this theme a ppeared sudd enly and I began to walk into a mass of information about the same subject. This has happened so many times. In a period o f abou t 15 d ays in 19 98 I met 12 separate people in different,_ locations around the United States, from very contrasting b ackground s, who told me the same basic story o f seeing a 'human' change or 'shape-shift' into a reptilian form before their eyes. Among them were two television interviewers who saw their guest, a suppo rter of the New World Order agenda, shape-shift from 'human' to reptilian. Afterwards one said h e had b een shocked to see the man's face turn reptilian and the other, equally shocked, said that she had seen h is hands take on a reptilian appearance. A friend o f one of the presenters was a policeman in Denver, Colorado, a major Illuminati and Satanic ce ntre, where reptilian g argoy les (an Illuminati code) and Freemasonic imagery adorn the Denver Airport. The policeman h ad made a routine visit to an o ffice block in Aurora, near Denver, and comm ented to an executive of one of the c ompanies there a bou t the high level of security in the building. She said that he shou ld look at the upp er floors if he wanted to see some real security. She pointed to a lift that only went to the higher floors and she told him of an astonishing experience she had some weeks earlier. The lift had op ened and a strange figure e merged. He was albino- white with a face shaped like a lizard and eyes with pu pils that were vertical like a reptile's. I was to h ear many such d escriptions in the months ahead. This white lizard figure had walked ou t of the restricted lift, she said, and into an o fficial-looking car. The policeman was s o intrigued by the story and the building that he made investigations into the c ompanies in the upp er floors. According to his friend, he said h e found them all to b e fronts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. Another man I met in that 15 d ays used to take large quantities of LSD in the 1960 s and around the third day o f a five-day 'trip', as he put it, the same thing always happened: some people began to look like reptiles and it was always the same people. It never changed. He also b egan to ob serve that his friends who appeared lizard-like in his 'trips' seemed to react the same way to movies, television p rogrammes and so on. \"We used to laugh and say 'here c ome the lizards\"', he told me. Drugs take people into altered states of consciousness and this can cause them to 'retune' their dial to o ther fr equencies of existence. At this point they will see other levels of the people a round them, beyond the five-senses. Look ing b ack from a perspective of greater kno wledge, he believed there is what he ca lls a \"morphog enetic field\" transmitted to the DNA of the lizard p eople a nd this aligned the ce ll structure to the reptilian g enetic blueprint. The Olmec people of Central America, whose whole c ulture was based on serpent worship, used to take hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms that they called \"the flesh o f the Plumed Serpent\", and this took them into o ther- dimensional awareness - the serpent frequency. I will discuss this further in the next chapter. In their rituals to the \"serpent son\" Diony sus (another version o f 'Jesus'), the Greek initiates would d rink strong wine a nd take mind-altering d rugs and mushrooms to \"un ite with their Son o f God\". At the e nd o f those 15 d ays in the United States, when I was s peaking at a Whole Life Expo event in Minneapolis, a gifted p sychic lady told me how she sees people in po wer, like Henry Kissinger, George Bush, and Hillary Clinton, turn into Reptilians all the time. Once a gain she is accessing their fr equency levels beyond the five-senses and beyond the 'cover' of an apparel1Jly 'human' form. I recalled at this s tage that I had read something abou t Reptilians in a book called Tran ce-Formation of America,1 which d etails the life of a remarkable woman called Cathy O'Brien, a recovering victim of US gov ernment mind p rogramm ing. Stewart Swerdlow w as programm ed in on e of the mind and g enetic manipulation centres kno wn as Montauk. For those new to my b ook s, I should explain a little background to this beca use it will be a recurring theme. Since the e arly 19 90s, I have been researching the mind-control technique kno wn as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), and I have written extensively about this and the e xperiences of its victims in The Biggest Secret and Children o f the Matrix. Basically, the mind fractures into a series of apparent 'personalities', each with different attitudes, beliefs and o ften 'ages'. The Illuminati have c reated millions of these 'multiples' through their trauma-based mind-control techniques to serve their agenda. These techniques have been kno wn for thou sands of years, but their use e xpanded rapidly after the Second World War when Reptilian Nazis like the\" Angel of Death, Josef Mengele, perfected the c oncept through mass experimentation on the inmates of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 163 the c oncentration camps. They u se a mechanism of the mind that appears to 'forget' the memory o f extreme trauma in the same way that those involved in a serious road accident do no t remember the impact. Their minds have not actually forgotten the e xperience a nd in fact they h ave retained it in photographic detail. But the memory is held b ehind an amnesic barrier to p revent the horror being re-lived ov er and ov er by the c onscious mind. It is a defence mechanism in its positive form. However, the Illuminati mind do ctors and g eneticists realised that if you could systematically traumatise someone, especially if you b egan b efore the a ge of five or six, you could fragment their minds into an almost endless hon eycomb o f amnesic barriers that they call \"altars\". Each o f these altars believes it is the whole mind and the only 'personality'. The victims are given a 'front altar', the 'personality' that interacts with d aily life, and this is the 'person' that others believe them to b e. But behind the front altar are the multiple a mnesic barriers created by the unimaginable trauma inflicted in the mind-control programmes. This includes violence, sexual abuse a nd Satanic ritual in which they see other children o r animals s acrificed. Think o f anything you would find spine-chilling ly ho rrific - then triple it - and that is what they make these children experience. There a re milli ons of such children and adults around the world. Once a n altar has been created it can b e programm ed with a 'personality' that performs tasks such as assassinating Illuminati targets or being sexually abused by some of the most famous people on Earth. If you don 't think that's true, read the detailed b ackground in my other book s or ask father George Bush. You're a n expert, aren't you , George? Why are so many assassins described as \"lone nutters\"? They are mind-controlled slaves of the Illuminati and they are programm ed to carry ou t the killings and hide the force that was really b ehind it. The front altar - the 'front personality' - of assassins and those who go crazy with g uns is often p rogramm ed to appear less than the full picnic. This means that after the killings people who kn ew them can tell the media how they always did seem to b e strange a nd weird. \"Ahhh, the killer was just a nutter, then, case closed.\" In the same way, children are 'switched' from the front altar to another 'personality' when they are a bused by the rich and famous. Once the trauma is over they are switched b ack again. The front altar has no idea what the other altar has experienced and h as no memory o f the a buse. These people a re a lso u sed to courier drugs for the Illuminati or pass messages between their personn el beca use of the same potential for secrecy. They are switched between altars by the use of hypno tic trigger keys in the form of words, sound s, hand signals or however they may b e programm ed to respond . This was the background o f Cathy O'Brien. Her Satanic father, who h ad abused h er violently and sexually from the time she was a baby in Michigan in the 1950s, handed h er over to Gerald Ford -later President Ford - for use in the Illuminati's global mind-control programm es. Cathy is blond e-haired and b lue-eyed, the genetics of choice for so many mind-control programm es, and I recomm end h er boo k, Trance- Formation o f America, to anyon e who wants to kno w w hat is happening to literally milli ons and millions of children around the world. I looked through the index to find the reptilian references and, although she rationalised the e xperience a s a mind-control illusion, what she describes is the same experience that so many o thers had b een reporting and continue to do so. She described ho w leading US politicians s he worked for in h er mind-controlled state a ppeared to take a reptilian form before her eyes and then return to 'human'. These included President George Bush, father of President George \"Dubya\", of the Anunn aki/Meroving ian bloodline. Father George told h er they were an extraterrestrial race that had taken over the planet, but no on e realised it beca use they look ed human. Cathy relates another important experience she had with Miguel de la Madrid, the President of Mexico du ring father Bush's tenure a t the White House. She writes in TranceFormation of America: \"De La Madrid h ad relayed the 'legend of the Iguana' to me, explaining that lizard-like a liens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan p yramids, their advanced a stronomical techno logy, including sacrifice o f virgins, was s upposedly inspired b y the lizard a liens. He told me that when the a liens interbred with the Mayans to p rodu ce a form of life they c ould inhab it, t hey fluctuated between a human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like ab ilities - 'a p erfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders'. De la Madrid claimed to ha ve Mayan/alien an cestry in h is blood, whereby he transformed 'back into an Iguana a t will'.\" 2 This is exactly the same story in Central America that you find in Africa, Asia a nd around the world and fits with Stewart Swerdlow's information. Researcher James Churchward told in b ooks like The Children o f Mu J that he e stablished the Maya of Central America a nd the Nagas of Asia to b e the same former Lemurian p eoples. The Mayans say the first settlers of the Yucatan in Mexico were the Chanes or \"People of the Serpent\". They were led by the god Itzamna, a name that apparently comes from the word \"itzem\", which translates as lizard o r reptile. The sacred city o f Itzamna, therefore, means \"the place of the lizard\" or \"Iguana House\". I have been told by h undreds of people a ll over the world, from every walk o f life you can imagine, abou t their experiences of seeing well-known and less well kno wn p eople transform into a reptilialian form before their eyes and then go b ack again. Father George Bush is the name that recurs most often in these a ccoun ts. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 164 Shape-shifting Prime M inisters Soon after returning from the USA and the rapid escalation o f my reptilian research, I went to see a woman in Eng land to discuss her kno wledge of Satanic rituals, which, she said, invo lved p eople like Ted Heath, the former Conservative Prime Minister of Britain from 1970 to 19 74. He signed the UK into the Illuminati's European Comm un ity, now U nion, and h as persisted to campaign for our further absorption into this centralised fascist state. Government papers were released after 30 y ears that showed ho w Heath kn ew that entry into the European Comm unity would eventually mean the e nd o f British sovereignty. But at the time he denied this beca use the Reptilians and their clones will say whatever is necessary to achieve their ends. Heath comes up o ften when you speak with the victims of Satanic rituals - those who survive - and their torture a s children. This lady was brough t up by a Scottish family and said she was sexually and ritually abused by the highly significant Scottish Illuminati network. As a result of this background, she beca me the wife of the warden o f an area of wood land called Burnham Beec hes, a few miles from Slough, west of Lond on. It is an ancient site mentioned in the Domesday Book o f the 11th century. Burnham Beeches is not far fr om both the British Prime Minister's coun try residence called Chequers and the former Wycombe home of the Illuminati Hellfire Club with its human sacrifice rituals involving royalty and the American 'hero', Benjamin Franklin (see The Biggest Secret). Burnham Beeches is owned by the City o f London - 'the Crown'. This is the globally-important financial district of the British capital and on e of the most powerful Illuminati operational centres on the planet controlled by the Crown Temple of the Knights Templar (see Append ix I). The c ity o f London do es not mean the whole of the ca pital. It is the a rea surround ing St Paul's Cathedral where the original city stood and after the Great Fire of London in 1666 it was rebuilt by initiates like Sir Christoph er Wren. It is now a sovereign state within the urban sprawl we call London and h as its own gov ernment. As I already h igh lighted, the c oat of arms of the City o f Lond on, an image you find all over Burnham Beeches, is dominated by two flying reptiles holding a shield adorned by the red cross on the white background u sed by the Knights Templar secret society. It is from this Illuminati centre that Burnham Beeches is administered. The lady who told me a bou t this area said that her husband, the warden in charge of the place , was a Satanist. She said h e had to b e to g et the job. They lived in a big h ouse in the wood s and p art of his work was arranging Satanic rituals there. She said that one night in the ea rly 19 70s while Ted Heath was Prime Minister, she was walking through the wood s after dark when she saw some lights. Quietly, she moved forward to see what they were a nd to h er horror she saw a Satanic ritual involving Heath and h is Chancellor of the Exchequer, Anthony Barber. She said that as she watched, hidden among the trees and und ergrowth, Heath b egan to transform into a reptile a nd she said what staggered her was that no o ne in the c ircle look ed the least bit surprised. \"He e ventual1y b eca me a full-bodied reptilioid, growing in size by some two foot, she said. This is a c omm on d escription by witnesses. She said h e was \"slightly scaly\" arid \"spoke fairly naturally\", although it sound ed like \"long distance - if you imagine the short time lapses\". I met Heath on ce in a television station b efore I knew any o f this and I never forgot the c oldness of his eyes or how they turned entirely black as he looked at me. There was no po int where his eyes made c ontact with mine beca use they appeared to go on forever like two b lack h oles into another dimension. I have heard many people describe a similar experience with p eople they claim to h ave seen shape-shift. The woman told me that she had seen o ther reptilian figures in Burnham Beec hes at dusk o r after dark, wearing long robes with hood s. The reptilian Windsors Shortly after this meeting, I was introdu ced through a third p arty to the healer, Christine Fitzgerald, who, as ackno wledged in the tabloid media, was a close c onfidant of Princess Diana for some nine years. You can r'ead the full story o f what she told me in The Biggest Secret. She knew nothing whatsoever of my then unp ub lished reptilian research, but a little way into our conv ersation she told me that Diana ca lled the Windsors \"the Reptiles\" and \"the Lizards\" and u sed to say, \"They're not human\". Christine went on to tell me that the Windsors were a reptilian h ybrid bloodline a nd ho w they h ad treated Diana in ways that were beyond the imagination. At the ce ntre of this circle, she said, was the late Queen Mother, Christine told me that Princess Diana used to call the Queen Mother\" evil\". I can think o f no one on this planet, maybe e ven in history, whose real persona is more a t odd s with h er manufactured image than the Queen Mother. Christine said: \"The Queen Mother ... now that's a serious piece of wizardry. The Queen Mother is a lot older than people think. To be h onest, t he royal family hasn't died for a long time, they have just metamorphosised. It's s ort of cloning, but in a d ifferent way. They take p ieces of flesh a nd rebuild the b ody from one little b it. Because it's lizard, because it's c oldb looded, it's much ea sier to do this Frankenstein shit than it is for us. The d iff erent bod ies are just different electrical vibrations and they have got that secret; t hey've go t the secret of the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 165 micro-currents; it's s o micro, so specific, these radio waves that actually c reate the bodies. These a re the e nergies I work with when I'm healing. \"They k now the vibration o f life and because they're cold-blooded, they are reptiles, they have no wish to make the Earth the p erfect harmony it could be , or to hea l the Earth from the da mage that's been done. The Earth's been a ttacked for zeons by different extraterrestrials. It's been like a football for so long. This place is a bu s s top for many different aliens. All these a liens, they c ould cope with an ything, including the no xious gases. They're landing a ll the time and coming up from the b owels of the Earth. They looked like reptiles originally, but they look like u s when they get out now through the e lectrical vibration, that key to life I talked about. They c an manifest how they want to. All the real knowledge ha s been taken ou t and shredded and put back in ano ther way. The Queen Mother is 'Chief Toad' of this part of Europe and they ha ve p eople like her in every c ontinent. Most peop le, the h angers on, don't know, you know, about the reptiles. They are just in a we o f these p eople be cause they are so p owerful.\" 4 I kno w it is hard to imagine a nd g rasp the scale of the Queen Mother's invo lvement through h er life beca use you r mind tells you she was a little old lady. But, as with all of these people, what you see is just the front 'human' image, not the real being. It is an extreme version o f an agent in a foreign land op erating b ehind a cover story o f why h e is there a nd what he is doing. It's just that these people a lso h ave 'cover bod ies' to hide their real nature from the five-senses of the popu lation. We look at them with ou r five-senses and so that is the level of them that we see _ their 'human' form. But behind that they look v ery different. Christine Fitzgerald was able to see what was going on b eca use of her work with Diana a nd the a ristocracy and h er und erstanding o f energy, vibrations and frequencies through h er healing work. I have had to study an unb elievable number of subjects and research so many d ifferent strands of information b efore it was possible to pu t a picture together. That is one big reason why it has rarely come to light like this before. There is s o much to kno w before you can see the pieces, let alone how they fit. The Illuminati have supp ressed all information that is nece ssary to see the picture a nd you h ave to do so much work to overcome that. You also n eed a mind that is free (or free-er) and willing to go anywhere the e vidence leads. A few weeks after my meeting with Christine Fitzgerald in 1 999, Brian Desboroug h, a scientist friend in California, told me there was a woman that I had to meet as soon as possible. This was Arizona Wilder, a recovering victim of the Illuminati mind-control network, who h ad worked for them at a very h igh level. She said she had condu cted sacrificial rituals as a \"Mother Godd ess\" for the British royal family, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland and at a notorious centre for Satanic ritual known as the Mothers of Darkness Castle in Belgium. This is located in the same region as the headqu arters of the c ult respon sible for the widespread p aedop hilia, murder and child sacrifice that came to light amid enormous public a nger in 1994 . The ring invo lved famous pillars of Belgian society and a massive c over-up h as ensued to k eep it quiet. Belgium is a major Illuminati Satanic ce ntre and that's why the European Union and NA TO are based there. Stewart Swerdlow names s ome other major locations for the rituals as Land's End and Loch Ness in the United Kingdom; Rennes-Le-Chateau and Brittany in France; Bavaria in Germany; Phoenix, Arizona; Montauk Point, New Y ork; the Mojave Desert and Russian River (Bohemian Grove) in California; the e ast coast of Florida; and the Channel Islands. He a lso cites the Great Pyramid (of course) and the great castles of Europe located ov er und erground entrances to the inner-Earth. These, he says, are most comm only found in Scotland (hence the importance of this little c oun try to the Illuminati), France, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and Austria. s One of these castles over an inner-Earth entrance is tt\\ ~ Queen's Scottish residence a t Balmoral and the home of the late Queen Mother called Glamis Castle in the north o f the c oun try. I note there is also a Blair Castle in Scotland, the seat of the Dukes of Atholl. Bilair, Bilar and Bilid are names used for the c hief demon in some rituals. Arizona Wilder's original name had b een Jennifer Greene. She is a blue-eyed b londe from a French aristocratic bloodline witlj significant Irish blood, too. When h er mind and h er memories began to return after the death o f her controller, the Nazi Josef Mengele, she c hanged h er name to Arizona Wilder, she told me. Mengele, and the other leading Nazi geneticists, mind-controllers, scientists and engineers, escaped from Germany as the Allies arrived thanks to a British and American intelligence operation called Project Paperclip. Some very famous names are mentioned with compelling consistency by p eople like Arizona - father George Bush, Henry Kissinger, Dick Cheney, the British royal family, the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and a long list of others detailed in my o ther books. Arizona is one of the many p eople with 'multiple' programm ing who are breaking do wn the c ompartments and remembering their unimaginable e xperiences. In The Biggest Secret and the video Reve lations of a Mother Goddess, she tells her story in d etail and n ames the famous names invo lved on both sides of the Atlantic. She says she was chosen by them beca use of her blood line. The IlluminatiReptilians literally b reed people to condu ct their rituals for them. Such p eople tend to b e very p sychic a nd are able to conn ect easily with energy. They manipulate its vibrational state a nd d raw desired frequencies into rituals. From the moment a c hild o f these 'psychic' bloodlines is born, in fact even in the womb, they are subjected to trauma- based mind-control. The idea is to turn them into compartmentalised p eople who can b e 'triggered' to condu ct the rituals as programm ed, but then 'forget' everything they did un til that compartment is accessed"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 166 again for the next ritual. After the death o f her controller, Josef Mengele, in the 1980s, she said that another infamous mind-controller, Guy d e Rothschild, was brought in to \"take me over\", but it didn't work as before. This often h appens because the victim's mind worships the one who o riginally p rogramm ed them, especially if it was over a long p eriod. When I met her, Arizona had escaped from m ind- control, although there were many compartments s till to b e ac cessed. The e lite Satanists Support for Arizona's theme c omes from Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, another recovering mind-controlled Satanist, who tells part of his s tory on an excellent website highlighting ritual abuse a nd mind-contro1. 6 We also comm un icated d irectly on several occasions. Phillip, who u ses another name in d aily life, explains how his front altar or 'presenter' personality was that of a 'good guy ' Christian. But beyond that his s ubconscious was programm ed as a Satanist as the uno fficial son o f a French Rothschild. His mother was Lula Vieta Pauline Russell Campbell, who was born in 1917 in Farmersville, Texas, and d ied in 1977 . But, he says, his real, biolog ical, father, was not the man h e had kno wn as his father before his compartmentalised mind began to h eal and remember. His genetic father, he says, was Baron Philippe de Rothschild o f the Mouton- Rothschild wine producing estates in France, who d ied in 1 988 at the a ge of 86. Phillip Eugene told me: \"My father was a decadent dilettante a s well as a master Satanist and h ater of God, but how he loved the fields and the wines. He used to say it br01.ight out 'the primitive in him'.\" The e states are now run by Baron Philippe's daugh ter, Baroness Philippine, who, Philli p Eugene says, is/his half sister. He was, he writes, conceived by \"occult i ncest\" and was\" one of the hund reds of thou sands of both legitimate a nd illegitimate offspring o f this powerful financial and o ccult family\". Much o f this is don e a rtificially through Illuminati sperm banks. What Phillip says is confirmation o f my o wn research, as outlined in The Biggest Secret, that the main Reptilian bloodlines conceive c oun tless children to p erpetuate the bloodline a nd o nly a few are given the blood line name a s 'official' children.

She said that he was kno wn as Pindar or \"Penis of the Dragon \". She didn't kno w if the Marquis de Libeaux was his real name. Stewart Swerdlow says that Pindar or \"Pinnacle of the Draco\" is the head o f the Rothschild family who \"reports to the pure-bred Reptilian leader in the inner-Earth\".9 I guess the Marquis de Libeaux could b e c ode for a Rothschild. Swerdlow says in Blue Blood, True Blood that the thirteen leading Illuminati-Reptilian shape-shifter families are: Rothschild (Bauer), Bruce, Cavendish (Kennedy), de Medici, Hanov er, Hapsburg [Habsburg], Krupp s, Plantagenet, Rockefeller, Romanov, Sinclair I St Clair, Warburg (del Banco) and Windsor (the German hou se of Saxe- Cobu rg-Gothe. Other researchers give slightly different names, but families like the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Windsors are a lways named. Arizona told me how the Queen and Queen Mother regularly sacrificed b abies and adults at many ritual centres, includ ing Balmoral Castle in Scotland. This is where they were all staying at the time Diana was ritually murdered in Paris (see The Biggest Secret) and Tony Blair went up to join them. Arizona's accoun ts have been suppo rted by o ther 'multiples' I have met, not least those programm ed and ritually abused within the Merovingian Mormon Church. The royal family involved in human sacrifice was fantastic e noug h, but here a gain came the c onstantly repeated theme. Arizona described ho w, during the rituals, these people shape-shift into reptiles. Diane Gould, head o f the US organisation, Mothers Against Ritual Abuse, also confirms this theme. In a telephon e c onv ersation abou t ritual abuse, Diane a sked me if I could explain why many o f her clients reported that participants in their rituals had turned into reptiles. As I was writing this boo k, another therapist I met in Texas told me of similar acc oun ts by h er clients who h ad suffered in Satanic rituals and she said they h ad mentioned the familiar famous names to h er with regard to the rituals, includ ing Tony Blair. People might want to dismiss all this, but they should know that, while they close their eyes and their minds, children are being sacrificed all over the world. this very d ay by the Reptilian bloodlines - many thou sands of them on the main ritual dates of the Satanic ca lendar like May 1 st and Halloween. Arizona Wilder talked abou t some of her experiences with the Queen and Queen Mother: \"The Queen Mother was c old, cold, cold, a na sty person. None of her cohorts even trusted h er. They have named an a ltar [mind-control programme] after her. They c all it the Black Queen . I have seen h er sacrifice people. I remember her pushing a knife into someone's rectum the n ight that two bo ys were sacrificed. One was 13 and the o ther 18. You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears to be a frail old woman. When she shape-shifts into a Reptilian, she becomes very tall and strong. Some o f them are so strong they c an rip ou t a heart and they all grow by s everal feet when they s hape shift.\" [This is what the lady s aid who saw Edward Heath and it is a comm on theme in witness accoun ts.] Of the Queen, Arizona said: \"I have seen h er sacrifice people and eat their flesh a nd d rink their blood . One time she got so e xcited with blood-lust that she d idn't cut the victim's throat from left to right in the no rmal ritual; she just went crazy, stabb ing and ripping a t the flesh after she h ad shape-shifted into a Reptilian. When she shape-shifts, she has a long reptile face, almost like a bea k and she's an o ff-white colour. [This fits many dep ictions of the god s and 'bird god s' of ancient Egypt and e lsewhere.] The Queen Mother looks basically the same, but there a re d ifferences. She [the Queen] also has like bu mps on her head a nd h er eyes are very frightening. She's very aggressive... I have seen [Prince Charles] shape-shift into a Reptilian a nd do a ll the things the Queen does. I have seen h im sacrifice children. There is a lot of rivalry between them for who ge ts to ea t what part of the b ody and who ge ts to ab sorb the victim's last breath and steal their soul. I ha ve a lso seen Andrew participate and I have seen Prince Philip and Charles' sister [Anne ] at the rituals, but they didn't participate when I was there. When Andrew shape-shifts, he looks more like o ne of the lizards. The royals are some o f the worst, OK, as far as enjoying the killing, enjoying the sacrifice, and ea ting the flesh; they're some o f the worst of all of them. They don't care if you see it. Who a re you go ing to tell, who is going to believe you? They feel that is their birthright and they love it. They love it.\" 10 Stewart Swerdlow describes s imilar scenes from his own experience a nd ho w the sacrifice is terrorised before\" a final thrust of a blade disembowels the victim, resulting in rivers of blood flowing ov er the crowd's bod ies\". He says that the frenzy is s o h igh at this point that many b egin to shape-shift into Reptilians and en attack each o ther mindlessly. If you h ave seen the 1998 film, Blad e, with Wesley Snipes you 'll get the picture. Swerdlow tells how the sacrifices are ripped apart and internal organs and g enitalia are c onsumed. \" ...

He says he has guarded two p residents, two Secretaries of Defense, d two chairmen o f the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( the head o f the US military). He c ontacted me to say that he kno ws from his experience that\" aliens exist\" and that e gov ernment is lying abou t the Roswell 'alien' crash in New Mexico in 1 947. He o told me of a \"crystal skull\" in his possession. But his main reason for making contact was to tell me of an incident that showed to him that shape-shifting reptilians are real. When h e a rrived at a friend's hou se in Texas, he was told that two women gu ests were c oming from New Y ork. They travelled around the c oun try performing h ands-on-healing and they h ad asked if they could d rop b y, he was told. This former chief of police told me in p ersonal correspond ence what happened n ext: \"I arrived b efore the New York people and had a lready s tarted showing my c rystal skull when they arrived. They imm ediately went crazy [because of the skull] and started ho lding their hands up b efore their eyes and screamed 'Get her out of here' over and over. I can tell you that everyone was s hocked b y their actions and I was extremely upset ... I carried the crystal skull out to the car and left it there. After about an hour everyone seemed to ge t over the uproar they made and things s ettled d own to d iscussions. Everyone introduced themselves and the two from New York volunteered to heal someone. Well everyone started telling them to do it to me be cause I had h eart trouble and was recovering from a heart attack. I hesitated, but finally relented and said OK. \"They s prang over to me so fast that it startled me. One got beh ind me and one straddled my legs in front of me. They did this without touching me a nd they both started runn ing their hands around my body aga in without touching me an ywhere. This went on for about a minute then my eyes met the e yes of the lady in front of me. That was s ome e xperience, our eyes meeting. Pay attention to what I say here. I could see imm ediately that she knew that I knew and it broke h er concentration. She lost control and changed into a Reptilipn right before my eyes. No sooner than she lost control, she regained it and shape-shifted back into a hu man. All this took place in the b link of an e ye. They imm ediately jumped up and said that they had to leave a nd left within 30 second s of this happening.\" He said h e did not say anything abou t what he had seen, but when everyon e began to leave, two gu ests stayed b ehind and would not move. Eventually they asked: \"Did you see what we saw?\" He asked them what they meant and they said they h ad seen the lady\" ... change into a reptile a nd then change back\".

The woman said she was a contactee a nd she had a meeting with a spaceship on a ce rtain d ate. She also said that they were taking h er and she would n ever be back on Earth. Odette said she was not conv inced at all and especially when the woman h ad said that if they could o nly see her real self, they would see how beautiful she is, like a princess inside. \"I was think ing, yeah right!

Then she a sked Odette if she would let her reveal her real self because she would n ever have seen anyon e like her. But she said she needed Odette's permission for this. Odette said yes because she thought, \"Poor thing, she's really miserable \".\" The a ccount continues: \"We went to a qu iet room.

Both were formed by members of the Meroving ian blood line like.J:,4e Mormons, Joseph Smith and Brigham Youn g, and Charles Taze Russell of the Watchtower Society. These 'Churches' have been controlled ever since by the Merovingian Reptilian shape-shifters. A lady called Diana Huston told me of her experiences with the Jehov ah's Witness mind-control sect, officially titled the watchtower Bible a nd Tract Society.13 She joined them in 1969 b eca use, after going through the Vietnam War with h er husband, was attracted by the message of paradise on Earth. She was OK for a few years, but then they b ecame more demanding and controlling. In 1987 she said that subliminal drawings began to appear in the a rtwork o f their book s and magazines depicting bizarre faces and trance messages. Some of these a re detailed in the Symbo lism Archives on my website (www .davidicke.com). At a small conv ention in September 198 8, she spok e privately to on e of the gov erning bo dy 'elect'. At that time she though t they were e 'good guy s'. The man was abou t five-foot-ten with d ark h air and was powerfully built.

The membrane dropp ed ov er his eyes when he look ed at her and h e seemed to recogn ise her, although at the time she c ouldn't imagine why. The sense f terrible danger that she felt, and the need to g et away from him, was overwhelming. She went on: \"Eventually I came to u nderstand that the leaders are not fully human, but are the offspring of something alien to this Earth. They are too cunning, lethal, and intelligent to h ave originated from here, and there has to be an over-race of beings guiding them from some d imension. They are he re for one reason on ly. They look at humans as a source of enslavement for their enjoyment to torment and abuse, to misuse p ower and to cruelly pun ish and kill.\" 14 As s he researched the religion's documents and book s, she said she began to un cover a trail of arms and drug-runn ing (which the Illuminati globally controls), and \"plots to d estroy the world and take it for their own\". Diane took h er \"mountains\" of evidence to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and met with them. They said that she was either a genius or totally insane. She said she learned that the Watchtower Society h ad hidden rooms under the streets of Brook lyn, New Y ork, where they h ave their headqu arters over the now abandon ed o ld Brook lyn subway. There they p ractice Satanic ritual, including the sacrifice of human infants, she said, and h ere they also k eep women who are used as \"breeders\" for babies to b e sacrificed. This happens all over the world b eca use the babies are never officially registered and therefore never reported missing. To the system, they h ave never existed. The main Illuminati bloodlines also conceive c hildren in the rituals. Diane wrote that this Watchtower Satanic operation is totally self-sufficient and even u ses blood in the ink o f the magazines. She said that she a nd a friend tried to warn p eople through the media with no succe ss (I am surprised!) and h er friend h ad a nervou s breakdo wn t«>m which she has never fully recovered. One of many accoun ts to come from former members of the Mormon \"Church\" was sent by a woman - 1 will call her \"Jane\" - who claims s he suffered in a Mormon mind-control project from the time she was a you ng child. Cathy O'Brien says that the Mormon Church and especially the operation at Salt Lake City is a major mind-control centre a nd I am produ cing a video called Sa tanism and the Mormon Church with a former Mormon mind-slave, Sharon Jacobs, who h as talked to me a t length abou t the rituals and Reptilian shape-shifters within the Mormon hierarchy. The overwhelming majority o f Mormons have no idea what their organisation is really abou t. Former military sources claim that the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, which is covered in Illuminati symbols like the a ll-seeing eye, stands over a large und erground Reptilian \"hive\" that can b e accessed from the temple. \"Jane\" said she saw her babies s acrificed in Mormon rituals and that is a c omm on theme of such accoun ts. Sharon Jacobs tells a similar story. In h er pursuit of the truth, Jane spok e with another victim of ritual abuse by the Mormon and Roman Catholic Church. This other lady told h er that the Mormon \"Proph et\" (the official head o f the Church) had taken h er baby from her at a ritual and eaten it. Two o ther women raised as Catholics told h er that they h ad seen the a busers shape-shift into Reptilians and eat a human sacrifice. Jane said that Joseph Smith, the found er of the Mormons, was from \"the occult blood lines\" (very true) and the whole official story was a lie. \"The leaders are mostly reptilian\", she said. \"One witness s ays that only on e of the twelve [Mormon] apostles did no t shape-shift at the ritual\". She goes on: \"I was s o mad to find out that the a lien a buse was c onne cted to the ritual abuse in the church when I had believed the church was true. [Now I know that] ... our families are from occult bloodlines of England and Europe. This has gone on for hundreds and thousands of years.\" 15 Sharon Jacobs has confirmed all of this and more a nd she names in the video the major Mormon leaders involved. She tells of horrific sex and b lood rituals under the Salt Lake Temple in which goats and b abies"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 170 are sacrificed and aborted foetuses eaten by the participants. Stewart Swerdlow says that one reason sex is s o important in the rituals is that human semen is considered the most potent boo ster of mamm alian genetics to h old Reptilian form. This often invo lves eating the genitals of the sacrificial victim. l6 For certain, Satanic ritual goes on within the Mormon Church and, in fact, the number of acc oun ts has forced even the Mormon hierarchy to admit it happens. What they d eny, of course, is the scale on which it happens and that it goes right to the top. Indeed, it is orchestrated from there. There are a number of websites expo sing this, includ ing a site set up by former Mormons, one of whom is the same bloodline a s the Mormon h ero Brigham Young.? The Mormon Church is s uch a blatant Illuminati front. Orrin Hatch, the senator for Utah, has appeared a number of times in my books for his s tatements s uppo rting the Illuminati line. He is the man attacking Internet freedom and p ressing for technology that would d estroy computers when p eople download copy righted material. This is not the real reason, obviously. The idea e ventually is to d estroy the computers of those c hallenging the Illuminati agenda. Ironically, Hatch also claims to b e a n advo cate of child p rotection. Well, if he's really serious he should start with the Mormon Church. Do you think he will? Nor me. Rothschild-Bauer-Bush The c onn ection b etween the hyb rid bloodlines and shape-shifting is constantly confirmed. Here is one excellent example. The Rothschilds are a predominant reptilian shape-shifting bloodline a nd they were called Bauer before they changed their name to Rothschild o r \"Red Shield\", when their banking dyn asty began in Frankfurt, Germany. The Bauers (also Bower) were an infamous 'occult' family o f Midd le Ages Germany. Of course they were; they are from the line of \"Sorcerer Kings\". The word \"Roth\" also developed into Roads, Rhoads, or Rhodes, the name of Cecil Rhod es, the Rothschild place man who b rough t devastation and g enocide to southern Africa. The c oun try o f Rhod esia, now Zimbabwe, was named after him. On Rhod es' imm ense memorial in Cape Town, South Africa, there a re lines of lions - a symbol of the serpent cult/Illuminati. Another Reptilian bloodline is the Bush family in the United States, which h as provided two o f the last three US Presidents. I stress that I am not saying that everyon e called Bauer or Bush throug hout the world is like this. I am talking o f these Anunn aki Reptilian blood lines that have taken the name Bauer and Bush. I was sent a letter to my website from a source that did not wish his name to b e published. It pulls together the names Bauer (Rothschild) and Bush in on e story. Before you read it, you need to kno w that FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United States, is a major Illuminati operation, as I have e xplained in d etail in o ther book s. It has the power to take control of every aspect of American life, by law, whenever the President calls a State of Emergency. Anyway, here is a fascinating story connecting FEMA, the Rothschild/Bauer and Bush b loodlines, and shape-shifting: \"A few years ago I became a cquainted with a lovely person with the surname of Bauer. We h ad many varied and wide-ranging d iscussions. During o ne of these talks, the subject of schizophrenia came up. She said it ran in h er family. Asking for more detail, she told me her mother and g reat aun t had been a fflicted b y it. It was the vision hallucination type. The odd thing is that the ha llucinations were incredibly s imilar. Their 'hal1ucinations' were of people 'of royal blood' turning into g iant lizards! \"I had forgotten a bout this experience until I read David's boo k. It was just one o f those o dd things that didn't make sense. Now it does ... I was in qu ite a b it of shock when I finally made a ll the connections: 'So, what more can I say? I don't just believe it's real, I 'know' it is. Unless, of course, I want to den y my own experience and senses.\" 18 \"I was at FEMA training h eadquarters in Fredricks burg, Maryland, attend ing a radiological defense p ilot course in 1982 for the Washington State Department of Emergency Services. During the orientation, Louis Guiffreda, one o f the h ead honchos and a cousin o f [father] George Bush, came in to ob serve. When he sat down I noticed a dark haze a round h im. I kept looking a t him to see if my eyes were p laying tricks on me, but it stayed the same. I was up in the seats alone, as I like to be in these things. Soon , I noticed he was staring a t me! This unnerved me. I closed my eyes and tried to relax. When I opened my eye a gain, I saw him coming toward me. He sat down a few rows beh ind and to the left of me. I glanced back and saw him lean ing forward with h is eyes c losed. I figured he was just tired and decided to take a rest with me. \"While sitting there trying to relax, I heard a strange h issing and swishing sound come from behind me. I opened my eyes, but was afraid to look around. I saw a woman in our group looking up in ou r direction with a look of astonishment and shock on h er face. She kept looking up nervously in ou r direction. Eventually, Guiffreda left with h is bodyguards (waxy-faced suits with sung lasses) and the presentation continued. After the o rientation, I walked ou tside a nd found this woman sobb ing and shaking in the arms of ano ther participant. I intruded a nd said I wanted to know w hy s he was looking up with that look on her face. She didn't want to say, but with repeated a ssurance from m e she told me.

The Oppenheimer family are the c ontrolling bloodline in South Africa on b ehalf of the Rothschilds and they own the diamond and g old indu stries, much o f the media a nd d ictate to the gov ernment. This is a story sent from a c orrespond ent there: \"I was born in South Africa a nd years ago got to know an o ld lady in Johannesburg who h ad for many y ears been the lover of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, t he founder [with Rothschild backing] of the go ld a nd d iamond corporate cartel. She told me that Sir Ernest used to visit her in the afternoons at her flat in Parktown. On one o ccasion a s they were a bout to make love, his body took on the form and p roportions of a g iant lizard with scales and she said the e xperience h ad b een one of the sexual highlights of her life. The story which was s o strange a t the time ha s been in the ba ck of my mind for years and came back to me when I recently read your book.\" 19 Sexual activity seems to b e a time when shape-shifting can h appen as the hormones, blood and energy are affected d ramatically, and when the e xcitement can un lock the mental focus that holds open the 'human' DN A codes. This is one reason for the shapeshifting du ring blood and sacrifice rituals. A businesswoman in Canada told me of her Reptilian experiences. The first was with a Portugu ese man who treated h er terribly and she was little more than an imprisoned slave. She said h e shape-shifted into a reptile. She described how he was s tunn ingly ritualistic, even with the time a nd d ay o f the month h e washed h is clothes. This is a basic reptilian trait. She later had a relationship with another guy who, she said, was nice on the surface, but had a dark side he was battling with. She bough t The Biggest Secret when it was first published b eca use it expo ses in g reat detail the Ri'!ptilian ph enomenon she had experienced. One time when they went into h er bedroom, the book was lying on a shelf abov e the bed. T,he man b ecame very wound up and took a serious aversion to it, she told me. When they b egan to h ave sex, she said h e began to go crazy, becoming violent and rough . Amid this anger, he began to shapeshift into a reptile. Her hand was on the bottom of his back while he lay on top o f her and she felt her hand b eing pu shed up as the guy b egan to sprout a tail! She screamed, threw him off, and h e began to \"morph\" back to hu man form. She told him to g et out of the hou se immediately and, at the time I met her, she had never seen h im since. A Los Angeles jazz singer, Pamela Stonebrook e, has written and spok en pu blicly abou t her sexual encoun ters with a Reptilian b eing. When the very tall Reptilian first appeared in h er bedroom, she says she was terrified. The being forced h er to h ave sex and seemed to g et \"high\" on h er fear, but she says that as these e ncoun ters continued she c onqu ered h er fear and started coming on to him! When h er fear subsided, the Reptilian did no t seem to b e so k een anymore. Pamela c onsiders her Reptilian experience positive overall and talks of a c lose c onn ection with the being. But reports of women b eing raped by Reptilians are far fr om rare. I met Pamela briefly at a c onference in Los Angeles and she is quite a c haracter, very strong willed, and that's just what you n eed in these c ircumstances. She wrote a n op en letter to the 'UFO comm unity' (most of whom are depressingly closed-minded to seeing b eyond their own 'official line'): \"Reptilians are not a po litically c orrect species in the UFO community, and to ad mit to ha ving sex with o ne - much less enjoying it - is beyond the pale a s far as the more conservative members of that comm unity are concerned. But I know from m y extensive reading and research, and from talking personally to do zens of other women (and men), that I am not unique in reporting this k ind of experience. I am the first to ad mit that this is a vastly c omplex s ubject, a kind o f hall of mirrors, where d imensiona l realities are constantly s hifting and changing. Certainly, the Reptilians use sex to control people in various ways. \"They have the ability to shape -shift and to control the mind of the e xperiencer, as well as to g ive tremendous pleasure through their mental powers. I have wrestled with a ll of these implications and the various levels of meaning and possibilities represented b y my encounter experiences. I will say, however, as I have said be fore, that I feel a deep respect for the reptilian entity with whom I interacted, and a profound connection with this being.\" 20 I would stress here that not all Reptilian entities are of ill intent. There are many - those who h ave developed emotionally - who a-\\ ~ not trying to manipulate humanity and would like to h elp to remove the control of the others.

Reptilian un dergroun d There a re endless reports of seeing Reptilians and shape-shifting, but most people have no kno wledge of this beca use 99% of the popu lation g et their 'news' and 'information' from the mainstream m edia. Journalists, in turn, get their 'news' and 'information' overwhelmingly from official sources, which, like the media itself, are owned by the Reptilian bloodlines. After speaking about the Reptilians on the e xcellent Jeff Rense radio show in America, I was sent this accoun t of an experience a t the Dulce und erground facility in New Mexico. These a re the words of an army p rivate e mployed on the surface : \" ... I was working on a routine job when another of the young en listees, a mechanic, came in with a small rush job he wanted at once. He h ad the p rint and p roceeded to show me e xactly what he wanted. We a re both bend ing over the bench in front of the welder when I happened to look directly into h is face. It seemed to sudd enly become covered in a semi-transparent film or cloud . His features faded a nd in their place appeared a 'thing' with bu lging e yes, no ha ir, and scales for skin.\" He later saw the same thing h appen to a guard at the Dulce front gate and witnesses have spok en o f seeing Reptilian shape-shifters at the Madigan Milit ary Hospital near Fort Lewis in Washington State. There are secret und erground facilities throug hout the world and at the deepest levels they op en ou t into the inner- Earth centres of the Reptilians and associated non -human entities like the so-called \"Greys\", who are subo rdinate to the Reptilians. Area 51 in Nevada is the best-kno wn und erground facility in UFO research circles, but there a re many o thers. These facilities are themselves conn ected by a massive tunn el network that has been bu ilt with nu clear boring technology that the public never sees. It can cut tunn els at the rate of seven miles a day and these are a n expansion o f the global tunn el network claimed by legends and acc oun ts to exist und er the United States, Central and South America, Britain, Egypt, Mesopo tamia, Turkey, Asia, China, Malta, pretty much everywhere. The tunn els have state-of-the-art transport systems that move a t astonishing speeds. Insiders describe them as \"magneto-leviton o r mag-lev mono rail trains capable of mach- 2\". Leading Illuminati companies and op erations are involved in the c onstruction and administration. Companies like the Rand Corporation, General Electric, AT & T, Hugh es Aircraft, Northrop Corporation, Sandia Corporation, Stanford Research Institute, Walsh Construction, the Colorado Schoo l of Mines, and the most significant one of all, Bechtel, the major Illuminati corporation that has won a massive c ontract to 'rebuild' Iraq after it was bombed by the ‘liberators'. Workers who experienced the deeper levels of the Dulce base saw scenes so terrifying they h ave refused to talk abou t them. From other sources, however, we ca n imagine some of what they saw. These bases are where many o f the millions, yes milli ons, of children who go missing every y ear worldwide a re taken. I kno w it is hard to stomach, but they are used for slave labou r and eaten by the Reptilians, just like humans eat chickens or cows. Workers at Dulce have reported seeing the most grotesque sights in the lower levels. Researchers Bill Hamilton and TAL L evesque (also kno wn as Jason Bishop III) gathered the following information about Dulce, which they pu blished in UFO Magazine: \"Level number six is privately c alled 'Nightmare Hall'. It holds the g enetic labs. Reports from workers who have seen b izarre e xperimentation a re a s follows: 'I have seen mutilated 'humans' that look like ha lf- human/half octopus. Also reptilian-humans and furry c reatures that have hands like hu mans and cry like a bab y. It mimics human words ... also a huge mixture of lizard-humans in cages. There a re fish, seals, birds and mice that can hardly be considered those species. There a re several cages (and vats) of winged humanoids, grotesque bat-like creatures ... but three and a half to seven feet tall. Gargoyle-like beings and Draco reptoids. \"Level number seven is worse, row after row of thousand s of humans and human mixtures in cold storage.

His information h as also b een circulated as the \"Dulce Papers\". Castello worked for seven y ears with the Rand Corporation, an Illuminati operation in Santa Monica, California, conn ected to the 'neo-cons' runn ing the 'war on terrorism', and h e was transferred to Dulce in 1 977. He estimated there were more than 18 ,000 o f the \"short Greys\" at Dulce and h e had also seen tall Reptilian humanoids. He knew of seven levels, but there c ould h ave been more, and h e said the 'aliens' were on levels five, six and seven. The lower you go , the higher the security clearance you n eed. The only sign in English was abov e the tube shuttle station which said \"to Los Alamos\", another major underground Reptilian b ase in New Mexico, where the H-bombs were developed that were dropp ed on Japan. Most signs at Dulce a re in the \"alien symbol langu age\" and a universal symbol system und erstood by h umans and aliens, he said. The Illuminati communicate a bov e ground in the language of symbolism, as I have detailed in o ther book s. The hieroglyph ics of Sumer, Egyp t and China, would h ave been a Reptilian o r 'alien' language originally. Other tunn el conn ections from Dulce went to und erground facilities at Page, Arizona; Area 51 in Nevada; Taos, Carlsbad and Datil; New Mexico; and Colorado Springs and Creede, Colorado. Castello said there was a network o f tube shuttle c onn ections und er the United States, which extends into a global system of tunn els and sub-cities. He described the imm ense security at Dulce. Below the second level, everyon e is weighed n aked and given a uniform. Any change in weight is noted and p eople a re e xamined and X-rayed if there is a c hange of three pou nds. At the e ntrance to all 'sensitive' areas there a re scales and a person's weight must match with their card and code to g ain entry. Castello also revealed some of the genetic work carried ou t at Dulce. He said that their scientists can separate the \"bioplasmic bod y\" from the phy sical body and place a n \"alien entity\" within a human body after removing the \"soul\" of the human. I have though t for years that some famous people, including p rime ministers and p residents, were taken into such facilities and po ssessed by a Reptilian entity. To the public the famous person look s the same phy sically afterwards, but now a very different force is deciding the behaviour. Ancient legends also tell of people being replace d in the night by \"changelings\" or shape-shifters. The Illuminati hyb rid bloodlines with their higher ratio o f Reptilian DNA makes this possession easier and this is why the Illuminati keep such d etailed g enetic records of family bloodlines. The joint global press announ cement by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in 20 00 abou t the mapping of the human g enome takes on even g reater significance when you think that the US Department of Energy has laboratories at Dulce a nd is closely conn ected to the genome project, along with the National Institute of Health, the National Science Found ation and the Howard Hugh es Medical Institute. All are Illuminati fronts. Researcher Alan Walton writes extensively on the Internet abou t the Reptilian connection under the pseudon ym, \"Branton\". He says: \"Underneath most major cities, especially in the USA in fact, t here e xist subterranean counterpart 'cities' controlled b y the Masonic/hybrid/alien 'elite'. Often surface/ subsurface terminals exist benea th Masonic Lodges, police stations, airports and federal buildings of major cities ... and even no t so 'major' cities. The population ratio is probably c lose to 10 % of the p opulation (the h ybrid military-industrial fraternity 'elite' living below ground a s opposed to the 90 % living ab ove). This doe s not include the full-blood reptilian species who live in even d eeper recesses of the Earth. \"Some o f the major population centers were deliberately established b y the Masonic/hybrid e lite of the Old and New 'worlds' to afford ea sy access to a lread y existing underground levels, some of which a re thou sands of years old. Considering that the Los Alamos Lab s [in New Mexico] had a working p rototype nuclear powered thermol-bore drill that could literally melt tunne ls through the earth a t a rate of 8 mph 40 years ago, you can imagine how extensive these u nderground sys tems have become. These sub-cities also offer close a ccess to o rgan ised criminal syndicates, which o perate on the surface. They ha ve d eveloped a whole science of 'borg-onomics' through which they literally nickle-and-dime u s into slavery via multi-leveled taxation, inflation, sublimation, manipulation, regulation, fines, fees, licenses ... and the en tire debt-credit scam which is run b y the Federal Reserve and Wall Street. \"New York City, I can confirm, is one of the largest draconian nests in the world. Or rather the an cient underground 'Atlantean' sys tems that network beneath that area. They literally c ontrol the en tire Wall Street pyramid from below ... with more than a little he lp from reptilian b loodlines like the Rockefellers, etc. In fact, these reptilian gene tic lines operate in a parasitic manner, the underground society acting a s the 'parasite' society and the surface society operating a s the 'host' society ... \" 22 A w oman kno wn as \"0\" claims to h ave seen the und erground facilities at China Lake Naval Weapon s Center in the California Desert, one of the major mind-control centres of North America.23 It straddles a large a rea a nd y et little ca n b e seen abov e ground . I have twice driven around the outside of the base. On one side the public road runs along side the perimeter fence for a while. The e ntrance to China Lake is in the little town o f Ridgecrest and this is where \"D\" once lived. Ridgecrest is home to many mind-controlled slaves programm ed at China Lake a nd it's not far fr om where the mass murderer Charles Manson and h is \"Family\" used to live. \"D\" said she was chosen by the military for mind-control beca use of her bloodline."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 174 They h ad told h er that before the development of language, humans comm unicated by telepathy thanks to a hormone secreted in the brain. This hormone, she was told, was no longer operating in most people, only in p articular bloodlines, including h ers, and they wanted to u se these a bilities. The period thousands of years ago when this telepathic human b rain function was genetically suppressed was symbolised by the story comm on to most ancient cultures of the god s giving p eople different langu ages to d ivide them and stop them comm unicating. The universal langu age was telepathy and this was replace d by words. The use of telepathy maintained hu man sensitivity to o ther levels of consciousness while words hold p eople in the five-senses because they are a five-sense ac tivity. That was the idea. \"D\" said she was taken und erground at China Lake a nd saw the genetics laboratory and h olding centre for captured hu mans and g enetically engineered mutants. She described seeing ho rrendou s creatures of all types, shapes and sizes at China Lake. She said she was shown these horrors to let her see what would happen to h er if she did n ot coop erate a nd she c laimed h er own son h ad b een murdered. Under China Lake, she said, a Reptilian sexually assaulted her and she saw another cut open the c hest of a \"Grey\". \"D\" said that from her experience the Greys are terrified o f the Reptilian leadership and do whatever they tell them. On another occasion, she said, she was taken to the Reptilian b ase und er the a ppropriately n amed Death Valley, a relatively short drive from China Lake. There she said she saw a Reptilian leader, much taller than the others, who was wearing an Egyp tian h eaddress with a c obra snake motif. Ancient and modern The stories of Reptilians and o ther non -human race s living within the Earth in what we would today call \"bases\", cities, or tunn el networks, can b e found widely d escribed in ancient acc oun ts. The Nagas, or serpent people, in India a nd throughout Asia a nd the Far East, were said to live in two main und erground centres called Patala a nd Bhog avati. From there, acc ording to Hindu legend, they b attle for power with a 'white' race kno wn by UFO researchers as the 'Nordics' (includ ing the 'Lyrians') and located in the und erground kingdoms of Agharta a nd Shambala. Tall, blond -haired, blue-eyed \"extraterrestrials\" are often reported by those c laiming to h ave been abdu cted by \"ET s\". Hindus believe that Patala ca n be e ntered at the Well of Sheshna in Benares, while Bhog avati is believed to b e in the Himalayas. Similar stories of und erground caverns and tunn el systems can b e found in Tibet and China. In the Gilgamesh stories of the Sumerian Tablets, we a re told o f und erground cities. Gilgamesh was a \"demi-god\" and \"semi-divine\" (Reptilian hybrid) who sought the imm ortality o f the 'god s'. The stories s peak o f KI-GAL or \"the Great Below\", which was ruled by the godd ess Ereshkigal and the god Mergal. In the KI-GAL were violent guardians called \"scorpion men\", reanimated hu man b od ies, spirits and the \"und ead\", and robotic beings kno wn as Galatur or Gala, which were used to abdu ct humans from the surface. There \\\\'ere \"eagle-headed\" Reptilians, which were often said to h ave wings. The accoun ts describe a race ca lled the Pazazu, a dog - faced 'human' with reptilian scales and tail. All this s ounds remarkably like the scenes described at Dulce today. Chinese legend claims there is an und erground world entered from the Eastern Moun tain o f Taishan and it is guarded by vicious demons called Men Shen with animal-like faces or masks. This was the Chinese 'Hell' and it is s aid that the Lords of Hell interacted with the Dragon Kings on the surface. The Japanese 'Hell' or und erground n etwork was s imilar, and among the non -human entities were the Kappa, semi-aquatic reptilian h umanoids and o ther shape-shifters who lived in mountains, under the ground o r under the sea. In Viking-Norse legend they h ave the giant serpent, Nidhoggr or Jormungand, that li ved und erground and Ws was similar to the giant serpent Apop his in Egyptian myth. The Scandinavians and Germans had their Huldre or \"Hidden Folk\" who were a lso kno wn as the e lves. One of the codes for the bloodline is \"elven\" and the beings of folklore like trolls, etins, fairies, elves, troglodytes, Nefilim, Brownies or Braunies and the \"lit1le people\" of Ir eland are a ll different names for the subterranean entities described in the modern acc oun ts of 'ET bases'. All the same stories are associated with them - interbreeding with hu mans, unable to go ou t in the sunlight (like 'Dracula'), and all the rest. They even mention the 'missing time' experience of people a bdu cted by the 'fairies' (like modem 'UFO' abdu ctees) and include many stories of these und erground folk killing and mutilating cattle a nd taking the blood. Michael Mott has produ ced an excellent collection o f these stories on und erground d wellers in folklore a nd myth in his book. 25 He writes that England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all have e ndless traditions of und erground p eoples with many similarities and comm on origins between them. It seems to me that Scotland, Ireland and the British Isles in g eneral are such a major centre for the Illuminati bloodlines beca use of the number of entrances to the und erground world there a re in that region. It is the same with o ther parts of the world like France, Germany and ou r old friends, the Caucasus Moun tains. What is really under the Windsors' Balmoral Castle or the Queen Mother's Glamis Castle in Scotland, that highly significant coun try for Illuminati bloodlines? There is a legendary \"secret room\" at Glamis. According to a guest, the writer, Sir Walter Scott and o thers, it is the family's law or custom that the secret is kno wn o nly to three people a t anyon e time. They take a \"terrible oath\" not to reveal the secret. Another guest, Lord Halifax, said that in 1 875 a workman at the ca stle ca me across a doo r leading to a long"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 175 passageway. The man investigated, but then h e saw something that made him run b ack in terror. When the 13th Earl of Strathmore was told what the workman h ad seen h e persuaded h im to acce pt money to emigrate a nd g ive his word n ever to reveal what he saw. Lord Halifax said that after the incident the Earl was a c hanged man, who b eca me silent and moody, with an \"anxious, scared face\". The Norse/Germanic fairies, goblins, trows, knockers, brownies, leprechauns, sidhe (shee), tylwyth teg (terlooeth teig) and so on were either malevolent or indifferent to hu manity, Michael Mott says. They lived, virtually without exception, und er the ground. Mound s, hills, ruins, hill-forts, mountains, cliffs and ancient cities were said to b e the \"rooftops\" of their palace s. Beings that mirror modem reports of the Sasquatch (Big Foot) and the Yeti (Abominable Snowman) can b e found in ancient stories of und erground creatures that come to the surface. Like the Nagas, the serpent people of Asia, European folklore often claimed that these \"fairy\" people e ntered their und erground homes through lakes. Michael Mott continues: \"To remove a ll doubt as to their relationship with Norse h idden-folk and Indian Nagas alike, they s hunned the sunlight [like Dracula], and often seemed interested in crossbreeding their own b loodlines with those o f human be ings, or even in crossbreed ing their 'livestock' or fairy c attle, horses, hounds and so forth with the surface species which were most compatible. The goblin-dwarf, Rumplestiltskin, in h is lust to h ave the human b aby and its genetic bounty, is just one e xample o f this in folklore. The e lves took a regular interest in hu man affairs-weddings, births and d eaths, (bloodlines), the success of crops and livestock, and so forth - but only for their own selfish interests. They s eemed to be overly-concerned with g enetic and b iological diversity, and they pilfered livestock, crops and hu man genes via theft or cross-species liaison whenever they s aw fit to do so. The e lves are generally depicted a s extremely fair-haired and fair-skinned.\" 26 The a ccoun ts even include the idea of being imprisoned und erground waiting for the day o f judgement. Michael Mott summarises the c omm on attributes of the inner-Earth p eoples of global folklore. The a ccoun ts are incredibly consistent over thou sands of years. Mott writes: \"They are mostly reptilian o r reptilian hu mano ids or 'fair' and Nordic; they are telepathic with sup erior mental po wers; they can shape-shift and create illusion s; they want to interbreed with hu mans and n eed hu man b lood , flesh and reprodu ctive materials; they h ave a dv anced techno logy; they h ave the secret of immortality; they can fly, either by themselves or with their techno logy ; they mostly h ave a malevo lent agend a for hu mans; they cannot survive for long in d irect sun ligh t; t hey h ave been b anished from the surface world o r are in h iding from surface peop le a nd /or the Sun ; they want to keep their treasures, kno wledg e a nd true identity a secret; t hey covertly manipu late e vents on the surface world; they h ave surface hu mans working for them through the priesthoods, cults and secret societies; they h ave a pu trid smell like 'sulphu r and b rimston e'.\" 27 \"The reptilian aspect of some und erworlders permeates folklore. One un iversal theme that recurs in the folktales of many , many cultures is that of the snake-hu sband o r snake-wife, who can transform into a 'human' or humano id form and is inv ariably (of cou rse) of roy al blood among h is or her own k ind (talk abou t the ultimate pick-up line!), Often the snake or serpent-man exacts a promise of marriage, or the hand o f an unbo rn hu man child in b etrothal, con sistent with the theme of the sub terranean's interest in maintaining their own g enetic diversity. \"A variant of this s hou ld b e familiar to most readers of fairy tales, in the form of 'The Frog Prince'. The frog -prince is a Hand some Prince, bu t li ke the Japanese sedu cing d ragon , he has a reptilian o r amphibian form. The und erworld link is complete. for fr equ ently the frog lives in a deep well, from which h e is discov ered o r rescued by the female protagonist. A possible c onn ection is evident in the Scand inavian b elief that some dwarves wou ld 'turn into toads\", if caugh t by the Sun , much like Mimoto's lov er turned from a man into a 'dragon ' when the same thing h app ened. Slov enia has its legend s of fairies and 'little peop le', bu t Siov enian fairy tales are a lso p ermeated by the presence of the 'Snake Queen', a great, white, cave-dwelling creature who is part woman and p art serpent. The serpentine-yet-hu man Nagas are still believed by d evout., Hindu s and some Buddh ists to d well beneath Ind ia, Nepal and Tibet.\" 28 The a ncient and modern interconn ecting acc oun ts are overwhelming when you put them together. I have summ arised h ere only a fraction o f what has come to light in my research. You will find far more a bou t the Reptilians in The Biggest Secret. Children o f the Matrix and the Credo Mutwa video s ~ t, The Reptili an Agenda. By the late 1990 s, one thing was clear.

But I began to realise that the c onspiracy was not only a phenomenon of the 'five-sense' level of ality. It was also inter-dimensional. As I have a lready ou tlined, there a re many levels of vibrational reality sharing e same space, just as radio and television frequencies do. Broadcast frequencies only interfere or become a ware of each o ther when they are really close on the dial d the same principle a pplies to the realities and d imensions of existence that are a ring the same space that we a re now occupy ing. When p eople say that infinity is within you o r, symbo lically, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, they are c orrect. All infinity is within u s beca use a ll of infinity shares all space . The point is, however, that we c anno t see a ll of infinity with ou r five-senses, as you canno t hear all the radio stations available by tuning to on e of them. My research led me to the und erstanding that while 'five-sense' non -human entities exist on this planet, the real focus of the global manipulation was with reptilian and o ther non -human entities operating from frequencies a fraction ou tside the frequency range accessible by h uman sight. From there they 'possessed' the 'human' bod ies of the Illuminati blood lines and u sed them as a vehicle to dictate events in ou r reality b ehind the veil of an apparently h uman form. Our five-senses can p erceive only the denser vibrational fields that reflect light. As the vibration increases, it eventually reac hes a point where we ca n no long er see it beca use it has gon e beyond the frequency range of the five-senses. At this s tage, to ou r five-sense reality, it 'disappears'. It has don e no such thing; it has merely left e frequency range of our five-senses. It hasn't 'disappeared' any more than Radio 'disappears' when you retune to Radio 2 . The five-sense range is s o limited that e ca nno t perceive most of what exists in this universe a lone. According to the test research, some 99.5% of the mass in the universe is lost to the five- senses. We only see matter that reflects light, what science ca lls 'luminous matter'. This is why, when you are in complete darkness, you can't see a nything. Only when you traduce light to reflect from the objects around you can they b e seen. Some 99.5% of mass in this universe is called 'dark matter' because it does not reflect light and we can't see it. A friend o f mine, Giuliana Conforto, an Italian who trained as a phy sicist, explains all this in simple terms in h er superb bo oks, Man's Cosmic Game and Giordano Bruno 's Future Science.! We have people making d efinite judg ements and p roclaiming certainties abou t the nature of life and creation when we can't even see 99.5% of our own un iverse! The official scientific e xplanations of life a re blatantly absurd and when it comes to the big qu estions, the contradictions and anomalies, they h ave nowhere to go un less they change their found ation b eliefs and misconceptions. This is now being forced up on establishment science by qu antum physics which is demolishing all the long h eld 'certainties' abou t reality. An edition o f the BBC science series Horizon in 2002 was devoted to the gathering acceptance among scientists of the e xistence of parallel universes or parallel realities, as I prefer to call them. The opening n arrative to the programm e said: \"For almost a h undred years sc ience ha s been ha unted b y a dark s ecret, t hat there might be mysterious, hidden worlds beyond o ur human senses. Mystics have long claimed there were such p laces. They were, they s aid, full of ghosts and spirits - but ever since the 19th century physicists have b een trying to make sense o f an uncomfortable d iscovery. When they tried to p in po int the e xact location o f atomic particles like electrons, they found it was utterly impossible. They had no single location. The on ly explanation that anyone could come up with is that the pa rticles don't just exist in ou r universe. They s lip into e xistence in other universes, too, and there are an infinite nu mber of these p arallel universes, all of them slightly different. I n effect, t here's a parallel universe in which Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo; in a nother the British Empire held on to its American colonies; in o ne you were n ever born. They are even stranger than Elvis being a live.\" Different era, same manipulators Appreciating the e xistence of these other realities is essential to u nderstanding the way ou r 'world' is manipulated. It answers the question o f why p eople would d edicate their lives to a plan for global domination when they kno w they will be dead long b efore the goal was reached.

What if they op erate just beyond the frequency range of the five- senses and u se apparently 'human' phy sical bodies to manipulate the five-sense world and when on e body gives up on them at 'death' they move into another and continue the manipulation, the long-term agenda, for another period o f what we ca ll 'time'? Cathy O'Brien recalls in Trance-Formation o f America her experience with Bill and Bob Bennett, two well-kno wn figures in US politics. Bill Bennett controlled American 'education' during the Reagan-Bush administration and is closely conn ected to the 'neo-cons' behind the Project for the New American Century and the American Enterprise Institute. Cathy says the Bennetts gave her mind-altering d rugs at NA SA's Godd ard Space Flight Center mind-control laboratory. They told h er they were\" alien to this dimension - two b eings from another plane\". Cathy continues: \"The h igh-tech light display around me convinced me I was transforming d imensions with them. A laser of light hit the b lack wall in front of me, which seemed to e xplode into a p anoramic view of a White House cocktail party - as though I had transformed d imensions and stood a mongst them. Not recognising anyone, I frantically asked: 'Who a re these p eople?' \"'They're not people and this isn't a spaceship', [Bill] Benne tt said. As he spoke, the ho lographic s cene chan ged ever so slightly until the p eople appeared to be lizard-like a liens. \"'Welcome to the second level of the u nderground. This is a mere mirror reflection of the first, an a lien dimension. We a re from a trans-dimensional plane that spans and encompasses all dimensions .. . ' I have taken you through my dimension a s a means of establishing stronger holds on your mind than the Earth plane p ermits' Bill Benne tt was s aying. 'Being a lien, I simply make my though ts y our thoughts by projecting them into your mind. My thou ghts are your though ts ... '\" 2 'Heaven' between h eavens Thou ght transfer is another way that people a re c ontrolled and manipulated. The Reptilian mind b ecomes the human mind and you can see this happening all the time a s the Reptilian 'hive' mind b ecomes the human 'hive' mentality. Between d imensions, in this case between the third dimension (the five-senses) and the next one, the fourth dimension, are little 'crevices' of frequency, almost like neutral zones. The Italian phy sicist Giuliana Conforto calls them \"inter-space planes\" and they lie between the dimensions or, as the scientists called them in the Horizon programm e, parallel universes. It is in the inter-space plane, Giuliana sugg ested to me, that the Reptilians and o ther entities reside. This is the realm of the \"demons\" of folklore that have been frightening and manipulating hu mans for as long as ancient accoun ts record. I rang Credo Mutwa, the Zulu Sanusi (shaman) and o fficial historian o f the Zulu n ation, to ask h im if these 'inter-space planes' were part of his und erstanding. \"Oh y es\", he said. \"We ca ll them the heaven b etween h eavens and that's where the reptiles are.\" In frequency terms, the inter-space plane is very close to the range of the five- senses, but a fraction ou tside, just beyond the range that we can see. However, if someone with p sychic sight can extend their vibrational range a little they can conn ect with that frequency range a nd see some of these e ntities and they do . People who h ave taken mind-altering d rugs that break through the vibrational walls of the five-senses and allow their consciousness to see beyond it have had the same experience. Also, if these e ntities lower their vibration o nly slightly to enter the five-sense range they b ecome visible to u s here. As the Horizon science programm e a bou t parallel un iverses said: \"The on ly explanation that anyone could come up with is that the p articles don't just exist in ou r universe. They s lip into e xistence in o ther universes, too, and there a re an infinite number of these parallel universes, all of them slightly different.\" It is possible for particles to move between 'universes' or 'realities' and 'dimensions' and so it is possible for entities to do the same. This is a major reason why the Illuminati bloodlines have taken p art in their rituals from ancient ti mes to the present day. The rituals allow them to conn ect with their masters in the inter-space planes, not least beca use human b lood and the vibrational fields created by the rituals produce the frequency environment in which the Reptilians and o ther entities can manifest in the five-sense frequency range. Credo Mutwa has described to me how he witnessed rituals deca des ago at which p eople in the room shifted from a human to a reptilian form, but there have been coun tless other people from very d ifferent cultures and b ackground s who h ave described the same e xperience of what happens once the blood b egins to flow. \"Far in the past before Atlantis existed, men there were who d elved into d arkness, using dark magic, calling up b eings from the great deep b elow us. Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration, existing un seen by the c hildren o f earth-men. Only through blood could they form being, on ly through man could they live in the world. “ "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 179 The e merald tablets Ancient tablets, alleged to come from beneath a Mayan temple in Mexico, describe the Reptilians, their ability to shape-shift, and ho w they po ssess the bod ies of people in po wer. The accoun ts correlate remarkably with modern experience a nd reports. They are kno wn as the Emerald Tablets of Thoth, who was a deity o f the Egyp tians. It is claimed that they d ate back 36 ,000 y ears and were written by Thoth, an \"Atlantean Priest-King\" who, it is s aid, founded a c olony in Egypt. His tablets, the story go es, were taken to South America by Egyp tian \"pyramid p riests\" and eventually place d und er a Mayan temple to the Sun God in the Yucatan, Mexico. The translator of these tablets, Maurice Doreal, claims to h ave recovered them and completed the translations in 1 925. But only much later was he given \"permission \" for part of them to b e published, he says. You can read the whole tale a nd the c ontent of the tablets on this website: http://crystalinks.com/emerald.html. There is also a book . 3 However, you don 't have to accept all the details of that story to appreciate the synchronicity b etween what these tablets s ay and what is now being uncovered. The tablets tell of the \"children o f the shadows\" manipulating this reality: \"Spea k I of ancient Atlantis, spea k of the days of the Kingdom of Shadows, spea k of the coming o f the children of shadows. Out of the g reat deep were they c alled b y the wisdom of earth-man, called for the purpose of gaining g reat power. \"In a ges past were they c onquered b y the Masters, driven be low to the p lace when ce they c ame. But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces and p lane s unknown to man. Live they in Atlantis as s hado ws, but at times they app eared among men. Aye, when the b lood was offered, forth came they to d well among men. \"In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as are men. Serpent-headed when the g lamour was lifted. but appearing to man a s men a mong men. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like un to men. Slaying b y their arts the chiefs of the kingdo ms, taking their form and ruling o 'er man. Only by magic c ould they be d iscovered, only by s ound could their faces be seen. Sought they from the kingdom of shadows, to de stroy man and rule in h is place. \"But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil from the face of the serpent, able to send h im back to h is place. Came they to man a nd taught him the secret, t he Word that only a man can pronounce; swift then they lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from place a mong men. \"Yet, beware, the serpent still li veth in a p lace that is open , at times, to the world. Unseen they walk among thee in p laces where the rites have been said; again a s time pa sses onward, shall they take the semblance o f men. \"Called, may they be, by the master who knows the white o r the b lack, but only the white master may control and b ind them while in the flesh. \"Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only the master of brightness s hall conq uer the shadow of fear. \"Know ye, 0 my brother, that fear is an ob stacle g reat; be master of all in the b rightness, the shad ow w ill soon d isappear. Hear ye, and heed my wisdom, the voice o f LIGHT is c lear, seek the valley of shadow and light only will appear.\" Within that passage, whatever its origin may b e, you h ave the story o f life on Earth and the source of those who control the world today. The leading po liticians, banking and b usiness leaders, media owners and heads of the military are the \"serpent-headed b eings\" hidden b ehind h uman form (or their puppets and stoog es). They are the ones the Sumerian Tablets called the Anunn aki and the \"sons of the god s\" that the Bible ca lls the Nefilim. The background p resented in the Emerald Tablets is confirmed by modern experience a nd information from the inside of the Illuminati. Here are some e xamples of what I mean: \"Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration, existing un seen by the c hildren o f earth-men.\" This is describing how the Reptilians and o ther non -human entities exist in the same space as we do, but in another \"cycle\" or fr equency that we ca nno t normally p erceive. To op erate and manipulate our reality they needed a five-sense human form. They h ad to create a 'genetic space suit' that they could o ccupy and hide within. Cathy O'Brien says in h er boo k, Trance-Formation of America, that President de la Madrid o f Mexico told h er this was achieved by creating bloodlines that fused their reptilian DNA w ith that of humans. These bloodlines have a genetic, therefore vibrational, compatibility b etween the Reptilians and their five-sense 'human' forms. This makes the possession o r take-over of these bod ies far easier and more effective than with o ther human g enetic streams that do no t have that particular DN A combination. It is to retain this genetic structure that the Illuminati bloodlines have a lways interbred with eac h o ther and"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 180 continue to do so. It means that if they can manipulate these bloodlines into the positions of power, they are putting themselves into those positions through their control of these bod ies from their own frequency. This is the reason that the genealogy o f those in the major seats of global power today can b e traced b ack to the royal lines - the reptilian h ybrids - that ruled Sumer, Babylon, Egypt and so on . The a ncient Book o f Enoch says that those born o f Nefilim blood are, because of their \"ancestral spirit\" (Reptilian possession), destined to \"afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do b attle a nd work d estruction on the Earth\". The Nefilim are associated with hu man sacrifice a nd b lood d rink ing - just like the Illuminati today. The Book o f Enoch describes the behaviour of the Nefilim offspring p roduced with h uman women: \"And they became p regnant, and b ore great giants ... who consumed a ll the a cquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the g iants turned against them and de voured mankind. And they began to sin aga inst birds and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to de vour one a nother's flesh a nd d rink blood. The Earth laid a ccusation aga inst the lawless one s.\" That continues to b e the mentality o f those who manipulate e vents. Sharon Jacobs, who took p art in many blood and sacrifice rituals under the mind-control of the Mormon Church, told me how Reptilians and o ther entities would po ssess the men impregnating women in the rituals. In d oing so they would implant a frequency code in the DNA of the offspring that would conn ect them vibrationally to these inter-space plane e ntities. The vampires The Emerald Tablets also say: \" Only through b lood could they form being, only through man could they live in the world.\" Insiders have told me that Reptilians need to d rink h uman (mamm alian) blood to maintain human form and stop their reptilian vibrational codes from m anifesting their true reptilian state. Accoun ts of the Nefilim also include references to their blood-drink ing activities, as we have seen. All this explains why these bloodlines have a lways taken p art in hu man sacrifice a nd b lood d rink ing rituals from the a ncient world to the present day.

I have been writing for years abou t the a ncient Satanic rituals performed by the e lite of the United States at a place ca lled Bohemian Grove. This is 2,700 acres of secluded and gu arded redwood forest in Northern California. Cathy O'Brien tells in h er book, Tran ce-Formation of America, of how she a nd h er fellow mind-slaves were forced to serve the perversions of their abusers at Bohemian Grove. These include Satanic rituals, child sacrifices, torture a nd b lood d rinking. Cathy says: \"Slaves of advancing age or with failed p rogramming were ritually murdered at rando m in the wood ed g rounds of the Grove a nd I felt it was only a matter of time before it would b e me\".4 She says that the Grove has a number of rooms for different perversions, includ ing a Dark Room, a Leather Room, a Necroph ilia Room and one kno wn as the Underground Loung e, spelt as U.N.derground on the sign. In Figure 40, there is a pho tograph o f robed and ho oded men at the Grove standing along side a large fire while worshipping a 40-foot stone owl- an ancient Illuminati symbo l going b ack to Babylon and b eyond (Figure 41). These world famous Illuminati initiates at Bohemian Grove bum and sacrifice a human 'effigy' und er the owl at the start of their 'summ er camp' every year. This happens during a Babylonian-type ritual called the Cremation o f Care a nd in the year 2000 Alex Jones, an American radio talk show host, took a hidden camera into the Grove a nd filmed the ritual. He was too far aW3Y to see if the sacrifice. was an 'effigy' or real, but the human sacrifice rituals go on among the e lite of the e lite in much more secret and secluded locations during the 'camp', according to insiders. The Jones footage c learly shows the bizarre opening\" ritual and the sound qu ality is particularly good . At one point an 'effigy' is floated on a boat across the lake a t Bohemian Grove where it is place d und er the giant 'owl and set on fire. At this point you h ear very clearly a blood-curdling scream and on e of two things are happening. They are e ither sacrificing a human b eing in the guise of an \"effigy \" or they b roadcast the sound o f the scream of agony as part of the ceremony . Whichever, this is the mentality b ehind the Fourth Reich, just as it was with the Third. President George W. Bush, like his father and g randfather, is a Bohemian Grove a ttendee a nd arrived there shortly after the video was s hot. The Jones footage a ppeared in a television do cumentary on the UK 's Channel 4 in 200 1, a programm e that skimmed the surface of what really goes on at the Grove a nd missed a wond erful oppo rtunity.

Philli p Eugene de Rothschild says he is one of hund reds of thou sands of uno fficial Rothschild o ffspring. He stresses that often the most significant operatives in the Illuminati hide behind apparently 'ordinary' lives while dictating the a genda a nd attending hu man sacrifice rituals. This is my o wn information, too, after talking to Illuminati insiders. But he says that there are many pub lic figures that are very h igh in the Illuminati-Satanic pyramid and h e high lights Prince Philip as a major player in the rituals he has attended: \"I can recall the Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals, but never having the supremacy to lead them. I still regard them as lackeys and no t real brokers of occult power. Except for Alan Greenspan [head of the US Federal Reserve Bank], most of these fellows were camp followers in the o ccult, primarily for the econo mic power and prestige. Greenspan, 1 recall, was a pe rson of tremendous s piritual, occult power and could make the Bushes and the younger Rockefellers c ower with just a g lance. Ex-CIA Director Casey (as were most of the CIA leadership for the past forty y ears), Kissinge r, and Warren Christopher [former US Secretary of State] were in a ttendance a t non-ritual gatherings and some o ccult rituals as well, but well back in the ga llery. \"At the forefront of the rituals were [the royal families of Europe]. Prince Philip a t the p innacle. He stands. like most of the contemporary European monarchy. in the Charlemagne. Merovingian. Aenean b lood line. But he is its c urrent head. I am certain that his maternal chromosomes are in the current ·· antichrist'· Nephilim. Prince Philip ... is the lead ing b iological descendent of the 'Reptilians', as y ou call them. Imm ediately below him are the males of my family line [Rothschilds] like a court of ministers in charge of logistics and op erations. The current monarchs of The Netherlands. Spain, and some of the o ld Austrian nob ility [Habsburgs] are next in o ccult power and in the conspiracy.\" 6 There is a lot of detailed b ackground to Prince Philip and the Windsors in The Biggest Secret. Other information h as come from the victims of the Illuminati mind control programm es, like Stewart Swerdlow, who was held at Montauk Point on Long Island, New Y ork, which h as been the subject of a number of publications. Stewart tells how he witnessed hu man sacrifice ce remonies at Montauk involving William F. Buckley, the well-known American pu blisher and Bohemian Grove member, who, I was told by Arizona Wilder, heads the e lite Janus mind-control operation b ased at NA TO headqu arters in Belgium. Arizona says she has had similar experiences with Buckley. Swerdlow w rites in his book, Blue Blood, True Blood that during his time in captivity at Montauk h e often saw other apparently famous people a t the rituals: \" ... Many well-known p ersona lities c ame to pa rticipate. Some of these were po litical figures. while o thers were in the media or literary world. I remember seeing p ersonages that looked like Sir Laurence Gardner. William F. Buckley. Sean Connery, Spiro Agnew, Henry Kissinge r. John F. Kenn edy, Jr .. t he Shah of Iran. and numerous other actors. military personne l, and Middle Eastern figures. whose na mes I did not know. All, but Kenned y and Connery s hap e-shifted into Reptilian form during the ceremonies. \"On most occasions they gorge on fetuses harvested from abortion clinics. They also had live b abies that they held up b y the ba ck of the ne ck. Then , they s lashed its throat from left to right. ear to ea r. biting d own on the gaping o pening to d rink the b lood. This was an a mazing de licacy to them.\"- Telling tails Swerdlow says that the kno wledge he learned at Montauk showed h im how the Reptilians s hape-shift. He said there a re locked sequences and op en sequences of DNA. Open codes manifest as a phy sical characteristic while c losed codes do no t. The Reptilian h ybrids, he says, have the a bility to lock o ff certain genetic c odings while they op en o thers. When this happens, he says, there is a literal transformation o f the cellular structure, which changes from a mamm alian to a reptilian form. \"So it's not like the human form goes anywhere\", he told me, \"It just shifts, it changes into a reptilian form beca use those sequences are opened. They also h ave the a bility to shift it back\". However much you r mind may b e struggling to cope"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 183 with that, for sure what he says abou t DN A codes in g eneral is correct. Some babies are still being bo rn with tails beca use c odes from our reptilian p ast have opened in those people when they shou ld h ave remained closed and do rmant. These tails are kno wn today as caudal appendages and do ctors usually remove them immediately. But in those a reas of the world where that treatment is not available, people live their whole life with a tail. You o nly h ave to feel the bottom of your spine to see where our tails used to b e and they do no t manifest today, except rarely, purely b eca use the DNA genetic blueprint is closed. Swerdlow is merely claiming that when you know w hat you are doing and u nderstand DNA to a much greater level than h uman scientists currently d o, you can make this code-opening and closing h appen real fast. As the human foetus forms into a baby it goes through many stages that conn ect with major evolutionary po ints in the development of the present phy sical form. These include those that conn ect with non -primate mamm als, reptiles and fish. At one stage, the e mbryo has gills and is very much like those of birds, sheep and p igs until the e ighth week when it goes on its own evolutionary p ath. In the next few chapters we will see that the nature of what we think is 'real' is s uch an illusion that shapeshifting is s mall deal compared with what is possible. In fact, anything, literally an ything, is possible. It could b e no o ther way when you are dealing with an illusion on the scale I will describe in the third section o f the book . As I outlined earlier, Stewart Swerdlow says the Reptilians need mamm alian ho rmonal levels to h old the mamm al codes open and maintain human form beca use their 'base-line' state is reptilian and the mamm alian codes would close if they did no t consume frequent supplies of human blood. They also want an adrenaline that enters the blood stream in large quantities at times of extreme terror. Hence they have victims who kno w they are going to b e sacrificed and they u se the ritual to b uild their terror to the point of death. This allows them to d rink blood full of that adrenaline. Arizona Wilder supplies the same information from her own ho rrific e xperience. She says that the blood type the Reptilians most desire is that of blond-haired, blue-eyed p eople, as I explained earlier, beca use it is the most effective for the purpose of holding human form. She, like a lmost every 'elite' mind controlled slave I have e ncoun tered, is blonde-haired and blue- eyed. They are also the ones most often chosen to b e sacrificed by the Illuminati. Red-haired p eople a lso seem very important to them for the same reason and, most of all, they want the blood o f pre-pub escent children and y oung women who h ave not had sex. This is to do with the purity o f the blood and energy o f children, and the c hanges that take place within the energy field once a person h as experienced sex o r pub erty. Thus the Illuminati sacrifice c hildren and yo ung women more than anyon e a nd this is the origin o f the stories throug hout history o f sacrificing 'young virgins' to the god s. Feeding off f ear Human b lood is not the only target of these vampires. The Reptilians also feed o ff human emotional energy. Physicist Giuliana Conforto says that inter-space planes do no t have a natural energy source like a dimension. They are like neutral zones. Any entities operating there would n eed to create a n energy source for themselves and they h ave. It is human fear in all its forms. When we feel fear we generate a vibration, an energy field. Every time we think and feel, no matter what our state of being may b e, we are sending ou t 'broadcast' waves that vibrate to the frequency o f the particular thoug ht or emotion. We feel these frequencies coming from people in what we call 'vibes'. The low vibration o f fear and its associated emotions like a nger, aggression, stress and gu ilt produ ce frequencies that pou r into the inter-space plane a nd this has become the e nergy source of these Reptilian and o ther entities. The more humanity feels fear in all its forms the more e nergy - power - the Reptilians and o ther inter-space e ntities have to sustain them and u se back against us. The entire Illuminati system has been d esigned to g enerate the e nergy o f fear and turn the human po pu lation into an energy source. In the first of the Matrix movies, the c haracter called Morpheus holds up a battery and says: \"The Matrix is a c omputer-generated d ream world b uilt to k eep u s und er control in o rder to change the human b eing into this.\" That is s ymbo lically correct. The major children's movie ca lled Monsters Inc, released by the Illuminati Disney o rganisation, had the same theme. The 'monster' world did not have a n energy source a nd so they walked through 'doors' (symbolic of the interdimensional gateways) into children's bedrooms in the human world. There they would frighten children and when the kids s creamed with fear the monsters would capture that energy in a tube a nd take it back through the doo r to power their world. This is one major aspect of September 11 th and its aftermath that is not ackno wledged b eca use it is s o far fr om cond itioned reality. But imagine the fear generated as a result of 9/11 and the two world wars, the 'war on terrorism', and a political, financial, business, military and media system that is s pecifically d esigned to maintain h umanity in a c onstant state of fear, worry, stress and anger. Take a nother look at the microchipping p rogramm e from this perspective. Once people a re microchipped they can b e e xternally triggered through the c hip to p roduce fear on d emand. In the light of all this, look at this coded speec h made by George W. Bush after 9/11. The Illuminati use reverse langu age to speak to each o ther, so b lack means white; \"we will\" means \"we won't\"; \"we do\" means \"we don 't\"; and \"them\" and \"their\" means \"us\" and \"ours\":"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 184 \"The h ijackers were instruments of evil who d ied in vain.

The more e motion we can b e manipulated to p roject through fear and all its manifestations the more e nergy they can absorb and recycle a gainst us. Researcher Alan Walton h as uncovered the same themes: \"These vampirial types [of Reptilian] ... actually s eek to feed o ff human e motional energies and life force/essence in order to a cquire the en ergy that they apparently need not only to infiltrate o ur world bu t also ou r dimension. Having g enetically engineered themselves along more 'warrior instinct' lines. what little conne ction they might have had to a 'spiritual' side has been a ll but eliminated, and they are motivated on ly by the p redatory instinct of their collective which ap parently k nows only one agenda : conquer, assimilate, consume! All this has been confirmed b y many abductees. especially in more recent years.\" 8 The whole Illuminati agenda is actually b ased on the terror of not survuv ung and the Reptilian mind equates control and h aving far more than n ecessary with a better chance of survival. Most fund amentally to them their survival in the inter-space plane is dependent on h umans continu ing to b e their energy source a nd their worst nightmare is for humans to d iscover the scam. They h ave a lso created a society in which most people are focussed on phy sical or financial survival and that locks them into the reptilian b rain and the 'hive mind' they wish to impose on the pop ulation. Silent invasion All of these themes can also b e fou nd in the Emerald Tablets, as translated by Maurice Doreal: \"In the form of man moved they amongst us. but only to sight, were they as are men.

Sought they from the kingdom of shadows, to de stroy man and rule in his place.\" This is a superb encapsulation o f what has happened and is s till happening. The Illuminati Reptilians manipulate their bloodlines into po sitions of power - \"the c oun cils\" - and take over those bod ies for themselves. It is what we ca ll possession. The rituals condu cted by the Illuminati-controlled secret societies like the Freemasons, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar, etc., are one way this is don e. The major and ancient Illuminati families know w ho they are and their hyb rid n ature, but there are many o ther offshoo ts within societies all over the world who h ave no idea that they carry what has been d escribed to me by insiders as the hyb rid DNA \"corruption\". Nor are they trying to manipu late a nyon e. From what I have learned ov er the years, the DNA corruption lies dormant un less it is activated and un til that point it has no effect on the person. Such p eople go through life oblivious of their bloodline. However, if they come into contact with the vibrational codes that activate the c orruption then that is a very d ifferent story. They become seriously open to po ssession by the inter-space e ntities. This vibrational code or key is generated at the secret society rituals of the Illuminati network and this is another reason why they h ave performed the same basic rituals s ince a ncient times. They are designed to p roduce the vibrational code that activates the DN A corruption and op ens the vibrational door to the Reptilian entities. The c hildren o f Illuminati families are put through the rituals by their parents in the full knowledge that they are being op ened to po ssession to allow the baton to b e passed on to the next generation. Talk to anyon e who h as been involved in Satanism and they will tell you that its hierarchy is decided by the power of the demonic e ntities that you allow to possess you r body du ring the rituals designed for this end. The theme of 'selling y our soul to the Devil' is a valid one in the sense that Satanists allow their bodies to b e possessed in return for power in the five-sense world. The same a pplies to the Illuminati and, in fact, Satanism is one of the major strands in their web. One way I have found to identify po ssessed p eople is that no matter what their facial expression may b e, includ ing laughter, the e yes never change. They maintain a c old, fixed, emotionless s tare. I have seen few more glaring examples of cold Reptilian eyes than those of Hillary Clinton. Next time you see her, watch her eyes, the same with Bush and Blair. The Illuminati keep d etailed records of who h as the dormant DNA corruption. They h ave used g enealogical libraries like the one a t thg.Il1uminati-controlled Mormon Church in Salt Lake City, Utah, to do this, but the preferred method today is a global DNA database that they are now manipulating into b eing u nder the guise of stopp ing crime a nd terrorism. What happens to these unkno wing 'corruption carriers' is that they are targeted by the Illuminati in the knowledge of who they are.

How many times do we hear former friends and colleagues of those in po wer say that they are not the same people they on ce knew? We are led to b elieve that these c hanges of personality are due to the influences of power - power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Of course, there is s ome validity in this, but the main reason for the personality change is quite simply that they are no long er the same being, let alone the same character. \"Slaying by their arts the c hiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling o 'er man.\" These are the people who b ecome the presidents, prime ministers, banking and bu siness tycoon s, media owners and o thers who run o r administer the Anunn aki agenda, although the most powerfully Reptilian are those who d ictate from behind the scenes: \"Sought they from the Kingdom of Shadows [inter-space plane], to destroy man, and rule in his place .\" Me eting their masters Another reason for the Illuminati obsession with rituals is to allow other dimensional Reptilians and o ther entities to manifest before them. Some researchers s ugg est that the Reptilian faction b ehind the Illuminati was banished from the surface of the Earth and this five-sense reality by closing the interdimensional 'portals', which allowed them to move into this reality o r density v ery easily. These portals are vortex po ints on the Earth where dimensions conn ect and these are often the place s held most sacred by the a ncients. I have been told a number of times over the years that the Caucasus Moun tains are the location o f a major portal. The portals are similar in theme, if not detail, to the one featured in the film Stargate, the story o f an ancient Egyp tian p eople c ontrolled by high-tech, extraterrestrial 'god s'. In their rituals, the Satanists summ on the manipu lating entities into their presence by creating the vibrational 'doorways' that allow them to manifest. Words, colours and symbols all vibrate e nergy and the secret rituals use the c ombinations that have the required vibrational effect. Researcher Alan Walton writes: \"Some c laim that the Crowleyan [Satanic] rituals and Montauk [technology] projects have been v ery u seful to them in ... tearing h oles in the fabric of space-time that separates our dimension from theirs.\"! As the Emerald Tablets s ay: \"Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open, at times, to the world\" and \"Unseen they walk among thee in place s where the rites have been said.\" (Illuminati rituals to open the 'stargates'); \"Again as time passes onward, shall they take the semblance of men\" (which they h ave). This theme of sealing the portals might be described in the Bible's Book o f Revelation, which clearly d escribes the 'Devil' or 'Satan' in reptilian terms. It tells of St Michael, an ancient Sumerian/Phoenician d eity, defeating the dragon: \"And the g reat dragon was c ast down. the o ld serpent, he that is c alled the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was c ast down to Earth a nd h is angels were cast down with h im. \" ... And he laid hold on the d ragon. the o ld serpent. which is the Devil and Satan, and bound h im for a thou sand years, and cast him into the ab yss . and shut it. and sealed it over him, that he should de ceive the nations no more.\" 10 This could also relate to b eing cond emned to live in the inner-Earth. The vibrational veil \"Only by magic c ould they be d iscovered. only by s ound cou ld their faces be seen ... But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil from the face o f the serpent, able to send h im back to h is place. Came they to man and taugh t him the secret, t he Word that only a man can pronounce; swift then they lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from place a mong men.\" I have learned from a number of sources that the key to lifting this \"veil from the face of the serpent\" is a sound frequency that disrobes the illusion o f human form to reveal their reptilian n ature. It resonates a vibration that prevents them from holding their 'human' cover. This s ame theme ca n b e found in the movie, They Live (Alive Films 1988). This was the c reation o f director John Carpenter and it offers a visual portrayal of a non -human race controlling the planet while hiding within human form. Carpenter's entities control in exactly the same way as the Illuminati, through secret societies, mind conditioning and o wnership of the media.

The inter-space plane is home to many misguided, malevolent entities, and this is the origin o f the legends and tales of demons and 'evil' spirits. In fact, the word 'occult' has been g iven an unfairly b ad n ame. It merely means 'hidden' and the same kno wledge ca n b e used for good o r ill. If you u se the 'occult' kno wledge with love in you r heart and po sitive intent, you maintain a high vibration and conn ect with that level of consciousness. If you u se it without und erstanding (like those who play with ou ija boards) or with ill intent, you can conn ect you rself with the malevolent vibrational range that this represents. The emphasis in the Emerald Tablets on living without fear is also a vital point. This is how w e a re c ontrolled and it is the inter-space e nergy source - the fear of what others think o f us; fear of death; fear of being alone; fear of pov erty, fear for our families and children; fear of war. The list is endless. The e motion o f fear resonates to the frequency range of the inter-space e ntities and when we a re consumed by fear we a re much easier for them to influence a nd control. The hidden 'team' With the knowledge that we a re manipulated by 'human' bodies possessed by non human, other-dimensional entities, the a pparently complex, mysterious and contradictory b egins to come into clearer focus. People think that Americans would not slaughter Americans, for example, and g overnment agencies could no t have been involved in the plann ing o f 9/11. But the leaders are not American; they are Reptilians and o ther non - human entities possessing a 'human body ' that was 'born' in America. It is the same with the leaders in Britain, Spain, Pakistan, China, Germany and all the rest. These possessed 'leaders' have no allegiance to the people of these nations, their only allegiance is to themselves as Reptilians that have been manipulating this world for aeons to create a global centralised fascist state through which they can control a microchipped, constantly monitored pop ulation. Their allegiance is to a long -planned conspiracy to create a structure in which every child born into this five-sense world is imm ediately microchipped and turned into an externally manipulated and controlled b attery to p rovide a n energy source for the inter-space e ntities that are running the show by o ccupying phy sical bodies. I have symbolised the structure of this Reptilian control in Figu re 42. The Illuminati manipulate their bloodlines (in o ther words the inter-space e ntities) into the positions of power across the world through their secret-society n etwork in eac h coun try. Most of these leaders in the various coun tries are working to the same goal and they o ften on ly appear to b e in conflict for the purposes of deluding the people into a false reality. There is also g reat rivalry on on e level between d ifferent elements of the Illuminati beca use as one researcher told me years ago: \"They are like a gang o f bank robb ers. They all agree on the job, but then argue a bou t how the spoils are shared ou t.\" Those who are c onsumed by the desire for power and control are not going to switch that off when it comes to h aving po wer over those on the same side. But they all depend on the a genda for their collective power over humanity and that is the ce ment that holds the warring factions together.

They are Reptilian-possessed b eings working to the same agenda a nd what appears on the 'news' is a movie designed to ob scure the truth. They answer to a strictly hierarchical structure a nd anyon e is expendable when the a genda demands it. The Li blood line in China, for example, is one of the major Illuminati bloodlines on the planet and this has been b red into o ther race s over hund reds, perhaps thou sands, of years to the point where it does not manifest as a 'Chinese' bod y, but still maintains the c orrupted DNA. This happened, for example, when the 'Golden Horde' flood ed into the Caucasus and Eastern Europe to interbreed with the blood lines that came from Sumer and Egyp t. A fellow researcher contacted me to say that he had an excellent Chinese source that claimed to h ave seen the Illuminati Li family 'tree' and saw that it· conn ected to Bill Clinton and the Bush family. Funn ily enough, I have a lways though t that Colin Powell looked far more Asian than African- American. The Reptilian blood lines do no t relate to an Earth race, they h ave infiltrated all race s and cultures. The Reptilian entities in the positions of power manipulate the peoples of the world to fight eac h other in the five-sense prison and in do ing so advance their structure of global centralisation while produ cing v ast quar1,tities of fear to feed their own 'world'. The human race has been dup ed all this time and n ever more so than no w. The c ond itioned reality they are programm ed to accept prevents them from seeing the malevolent game that is being played ou t all around them. The idea of Reptilians controlling their lives by hiding within human form is beyond most people's comprehension b eca use it is s o far fr om their conditioned sense of possibility. They h ave never been told the vibrational truths nor had access to the ancient and modem evidence a nd information that would tell them a very d ifferent version o f reality. There is s till much to kno w before we ca n fully understand ho w these a pparently bizarre c oncepts and experiences fit together. But after all these years of travelling and research, I \"can see that one level of this amazing story is that otherdimensional entities with a definite reptilian emphasis are possessing certain hyb rid bloodlines that are manipulated in to the major positions of power. We see only the 'human' level of them with ou r five-senses, but beyond that frequency v eil our world is being controlled by entities that look nothing like we do. What you h ave read so far will appear fantastic beyond words compared with the 'world' sold to u s through 'education' and the media. Shape-shifting Reptilians controlling global society? Are you k idding?? But, as my journey continued, I realised that not even this was the e nd o f the story. Far from it.

Jean Toomer I had long und erstood that our 'real' world was only an illusion g enerated from our minds, but in January 200 3 and the months that •. followed I was to 'see' this for myself in a way that taugh t me so much more abou t the 'Matrix' through which the human family is held in 'disconnected' servitude. I was invited to speak at a gathering o f people a t a location in the Amazon rainforest abou t an hou r's drive or so from Manaus in no rthern Brazil. The e vent, over ten d ays, would o ffer the participants the oppo rtun ity to experience the 'psychoactive' effects of a plant called ayahuasca, which h as been u sed by South American shamans for hund reds of years (at least) to take people into o ther states of consciousness beyond the five-sense realm. Ayahuasca is kno wn as the 'teacher plant' because it allows people to experience these unseen realms where so much can b e learned abou t self, life a nd reality. It is also du bbed the 'plant of the god s', no doub t beca use it can allow you to see those dimensions where the 'god s' of myth reside. In fact, it was the number of times that participants at these e vents had seen reptilian entities and imagery in their altered states of awareness that led the organisers to invite me. Ayahuasca is much u sed in religious ceremonies and rituals in p arts of Brazil and it is quite legal in such circumstances. Around the 'Western World' it is largely illegal to o wn o r take the brew, as it is with p otions in g eneral that can transport our conscious awareness beyond the five-senses. I wond er why?? I jumped at the c hance to accept the Amazon o ffer, although I had some reservations at one point when I learned o f the possible phy sical effects of vomiting and shitting with a vengeance. Once I was assured that the participants would b e made well aware of this before they p roceeded, I agreed to b e there. I knew this was the dimensional doo r I was looking for to take the next step in my journey. I had reached the age of 50 withou t consuming a sing le drug o r potion that was labelled 'psychoactive'; no magic mushrooms, no no thing. But I could go no further in my understanding without taking my conscious awareness to p laces beyond the veil. I also learned that even those who were regular experiencers of mushrooms and o ther such reality changers were a ware that ayahuasca was imm ensely powerful. \"You h ave never taken anything and you are starting with that?\" I was asked. Ayahuasca c ontains many po werful hallucinog enic properties including Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, a naturally o ccurring component of the metabolism of mammals and plants. DMT is kno wn by some a s the 'spirit molecule'. In January 2003 I arrived in the Amazon with my wife, Pamela. In the two weeks before, as we had travelled the Native American lands of northern Arizona, I had b een h earing a c lear 'voice' (though t transference or telepathy) in q uiet moments comm unicating information that proved to b e remarkably acc urate. Some of the detailed messages I was given seemed b latantly at odd s with the way events were looking, but the c ircumstances changed and the 'voice' was confirmed to b e c orrect. When I first arrived at the Amazon location I had some unease a nd I decided, as always, to let synchronicity and intuition gu ide my d ecisions abou t whether and when to take the a yahuasca. I was not going to do anything just beca use others did so o r beca use it was written in the schedule. The night before the first ayahuasca session the 'voice' said that I would no t be taking it with the rest of the group the following evening, but instead I would be taking it on my o wn. This s eemed strange a nd made no sense because the sessions were arranged for every o ther day and all the people were due to experience the effects together in a large round hou se specially b uilt for the purpose. The next day I went back to Manaus to work on the Internet to k eep up with events and p rovide postings for my website, www .davidicke.com. There was plenty o f time to g et there, do the work, and g et back for the ayahuasca session. But two p eople who came with me had p roblems with arrangements they had to make a nd although my work was finished I had to wait for them beca use we were sharing the same vehicle. When at last we a rrived in the darkness at the Manaus ferry for the river crossing on the return journey I saw it was just leaving and we had to wait ages for it to come back. Even when we were within sight of the location our flashing h eadlights did no t for some time a ttract the a ttention o f those who n eeded to b ring a boat to transport us across a river inlet. Add all these delays together and the ayahuasca session h ad already started by the time I returned. I was tired and frustrated and no t in the space I wanted to b e in. So I missed the session and later asked to take the potion o r 'tea' the next night by myself. This is what happened and the voice had b een correct. Around 9 o 'clock in the e vening I took the a yahuasca in the form of a drink in a small glass. I though t it tasted a bit li ke liquorice. I was in the big wood en 'round hou se' building, alone in the darkness, except for Zoe, {me of the organisers, who h as experimented with all kinds of such d rugs and their combinations."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 191 There ca n't be much left of the rainforest that he has not drunk o r smoked! I liked Zoe. We didn't always agree to say the least, but he's a nice man with a big h eart. I have heard it said that the plant takes you h ere or takes you there. I don 't agree with that. I think that ayahuasca opens the c hannels (or rather deludes you into think ing it does) and allows you to take you rself in conscious awareness to where you already are. Some will see dark p laces that reflect subconscious states and o thers will go to p aradise. Where people a re at in their deeper levels may no t be where they appear to b e in their conscious lives. A happy -go- lucky five-sense personality, for example, can b e a front to h ide subconscious emotional trauma that can manifest as a 'dark' ayahuasca experience. By the way, I will state the obv ious beca use sometimes that can b e missed. The subconscious is only subconscious to the c onscious mind. At its own level of awareness, it, too, is conscious and h as a different reality to the five-sense 'conscious mind' that directly experiences this 'world'. Also, what is the subconscious? It is all that is not conscious to the five-sense realm. In o ther words, it is infinite. Like the conscious mind, the subconscious can b e caugh t in the illusion o r be a ware of its infinity. Which level of the infinite subconscious that is comm unicating with the c onscious mind will obviously make a fund amental difference to the way p eople see themselves and their sense of reality. It is the difference between kno wing you are a n expression o f the Infinite One or believing you are a n 'ordinary' and 'powerless' non entity .. I began to feel the e ffects of the a yahuasca pretty qu ickly and I felt nauseous and agitated. I then began to scream out years of pent up frustration and I mean scream. The frustration g oing b ack to the days of the mass ridicule, the supp ressed emotion I didn't know w as there, was unleashed into the darkness. Good riddance. Some people, as I was to learn, can vo mit to Olympian p roportions after taking ayahuasca, while others have no such effect. The idea is to ho ld it back un til at least an hou r after you h ave taken the plant beca use by'1:hen it has 'metabolised' and can do its work. Zoe's announ cement during the sessions of \"One hou r - you may v omit now if you wish b eca me one of my abiding memories of the e vent. Anyway, vomit I did no t and after my screaming session I went back to the mattress on the floor feeling incredibly calm and at peace. When the ayahuasca effects kick in you go into altered states when you close you r eyes and you see bright, swirling colours and images. But as s oon as you op en you r eyes you are back in five-sense reality, albeit in a slightly altered form. I liked that beca use c omparing the two was interesting. The more powerful the e xperience becomes the less you want to op en ' you r eyes and when you do they don 't want to stay op en for long . Anyhow, that is what happened to me, especially on the second n ight. The 'One' I was s oon to und erstand why I was doing this first session by myself beca use I started to speak ou t loud and that would not have been po ssible with everyon e e lse in the room having their own experiences. I remember most of the words and all of the themes quite c learly. As I lay on my b ack looking up at the pitch darkness, my arms s tretched ou t, much as they d id in a standing po sition on the mound in Peru. Out of my mouth, in a very d ifferent voice to 'David Icke', came the words, slowly and po werfully, \"I am love\". I then began to repeat: \"I am everything and everything is me, I am infinite possibility.\" With that I felt a fantastic energy pou r fr om m y h eart chakra a nd fill the room. A strip light on the ce iling b egan to flicker on and o ff. After a few minutes, three of the lights came on full power. I look ed across and though t, \"Why h as Zoe turned the lights on?\" But he hadn't. The lights were a ll switched o ff and they h ad come on by themselves without electricity. Then the e quipment playing music switched o ff and came back on again after ten second s or so. Weird stuff on the face of it, but I could understand why an energy o f the power I was experiencing could effect the electrical circuitry. I clearly felt an energy coming out of my h eart chakra and arching from there to my h ead. The words I was speaking came through this s ource. I even called Zoe over to ask if this was what usually h appened. He said everyon e was different. I began to speak fluently in my altered state. It wasn't that I had though ts and then articulated them in speec h. The words just came from m y mouth and that is the first I knew of them. I will summ arise what they said and what came to me e ven more powerfully in another form the following night. In the following two chapters I will detail some of the gathering wealth o f evidence a mong op en-minded scientists to suppo rt what I was told. Some of the information can't be yet verified 'scientifically' and you will have to use you r intuition to d ecide what you make of it. But much o f it can. I was told in my altered states that all that exists is one infinite c onsciousness, which was referred to as 'The Infinite', 'Oneness' and the 'One'. In our manipulated, illusory, reality we had b ecome detached from the One..(J.n ou r minds, though not in fact) and therefore we viewed everything in terms of division and du ality instead o f seeing that all is conn ected, all is the same Infinite Oneness. This illusory sense of disconn ection is the mind p rison I call the Matrix. The time loop My words in the first ayahuasca session said that the five-sense 'world' that we daily experience is a 'time loop' that goes around and around b asically repeating the same sequence in theme if not detail. What we call"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 192 the 'future' eventually b ecomes the 'past' and spins around to repeat the 'present' over and over. That old Jimmy Ruffin song I've Passed This Way Before shou ld b e the a nthem of the planet, it would seem.

The same e xperiences keep repeating. The c over picture of this book was produ ced by an artist friend, Neil Hague, from a design and information I gave to h im that symbolised what I learned in the a yahuasca sessions (Figu re 43, overleaf). I would emphasise that the picture is on ly symbo lic beca use I was told that the Matrix is a vortex, like a whirlpool in a river, with the Time Loop - our five-sense reality - in the densest part of the spiral. Think o f the Matrix as a whirlpool and the Infinite Oneness as the river. The Matrix. is s till the 'river', the Infinite One, but, like a whirlpoo l or eddy , it is operating in its own little world to its own agenda. What has happened, I was told in my altered states, is that the Matrix h as forgotten it is the Infinite - the whirlpool has forgotten it is the river. Vortices can b e remarkably stable if the c ircumstances don 't change too d rastically. Observe a whirlpoo l in a river and so long as the flow of water continues in a ce rtain direction and speed the vortex will hold indefinitely. In the same way, the Matrix/Time Loop is going around and around in a perpetuating spiral or cycle that has become a prison for the c onsciousness trapped by its s eductions and illusions. The imprisoned consciousness, too, has forgotten it is Infinite Oneness. Conversations with the 'One' On the first night I spok e the words out loud and on the second I heard a powerful female voice a s clear as can b e that added much more detail. This is what I was told over those two n ights in altered states lasting a total of some six to seven hou rs. I will refer to the c omm unicator as 'the voice'. The Time Loop is encased within a Matrix o f 'non -phy sical levels' that have a lso lost contact with Infinite Oneness. These 'non - phy sical' dimensions of the Matrix are symbolised in the c over illustration by the ball of netting that encompasses the Time Loop . The 'nonphy sical' levels are the dimensions to which most 'human' consciousness returns after a 'life' in the five-sense realm at the moment we ca ll 'death'. It is free of the phy sical body, but it is s till caugh t in the Matrix. I will come back to this later. The very fact that we believe in time is confirmation o f the illusion that we take to b e 'real'. Time does not exist, except in ou r minds. What we c all 'time' is the illusion o f passing through something. But if we a re a lready everything, how can we pass or travel through ourselves? So ho w can there be 'time'? If we symbolise the human bo dy as the Infinite, how can you r body travel through you r body ? It is already the whole body to start with and ho w can it travel through itself? When everything is One, there can b e no 'time', only all things existing and expressing in the infinite NOW. 'Past' and 'future' are illusions designed to entrap u s in disconn ection. They are different realities happening at the same moment, in the same infinite NO W. The apparent sequence of one e ra following another in p assing 'time' is an illusion o f the Time Loop . Subconscious mind h ad b ecome imprisoned by fear, the voice said, and this had caused the illusion o f disconnection from the Infinite or Infinite Love, the only 'is' that we a ll are. This had reached such propo rtions that these lower levels of subconscious mind h ad d eveloped a deep and d eepening fear of the unk nown that lay b eyond its 'disconn ected' awareness. It had forgotten that it is Infinite Love a nd that what lay ou tside of its apparent bound aries was also Infinite Love. To ease its fear of the unkno wn, subconscious mind h ad created a c ollective though t projection - a sort of three-D 'movie' - that I refer to as the Matrix. How this is done, collectively and individually, I will discuss when I get to the scientific research into the nature of reality and ho w w e c reate it. The Matrix is a self contained system that has lost contact with the Infinite that exists beyond its illusory reality. In fact, it is the Infinite; everything is and can on ly b e. But it has s imply forgotten. The voice said that the key level of the Matrix is the repeating time loop that we kno w as the five-sense world. This is the 'power station' that feeds the whole system. The loop was created to provide familiarity that eased the fear of the unkno wn and was a very much more pleasant experience a t first than it is in ou r reality. When p eople a re in fear, the voice went on, they find comfort in the familiar and p redictable a nd this had h appened on a c ollective level of subconscious mind. It was a way for consciousness to whistle in the dark, giving itself comfort in the familiar. What is humanity's biggest fear in our daily experience? Fear of the unkno wn. Subconscious mind created a dream world that was to b ecome a nightmare. Seven months after this experience in Brazil, I came across an ancient Hindu myth. It said human consciousness had b egun as a ripple that decided to leave the ocean o f consciousness - the \"timeless, space-less and eternal\" "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 193  Figu re 43 : The Time L oop symbolised by artist, Neil H ague . The five-sen se 'world' is an illusory 'loop ' of manu factured 'time' in which the 'future' be comes the 'pa st'. It is the h uman equ ivalent of a mou se runn ing a round on a whee l in a cage When it awakened to itself in this 'disconn ected' state, the myth said, it forgot that it was part of the infinite ocea n and felt isolated and separated. This is basically what the voice told me had h appened. Wilson Bryan Key d escribed the human attitude to the unkno wn v ery well in The Age of Man ipulation : \"Humans detest uncertainty. Uncertainties produce an xieties.

The Frankenstein Matrix At this point the Matrix and its five-sense Time Loop were still on ly a c ollective mind p rojection o f the type now being identified by the more e nlightened expressions of science. This projection was dependent for its survival on subconscious mind continuing to h old that reality, much like a movie projector beaming on a screen. Once the projector is turned o ff ( in this case the sense of reality changes) the movie disappears too, and another is created to reflect the new sense of what is real. How this is 'don e ca n b e e xplained v ery simply and I will do that in the next chapter. However, the though t projection itself took on a 'life' of its own when it gained acce ss to an energy source independent of that which was projecting it. This energy source, the voice went on, was fear. The Matrix - the projected reality o f subconscious mind - absorbed the energy o f fear generated particularly within the 'five-sense' Time Loop and took on a life a nd agenda of its own. That agenda was to g enerate as much fear as possible to empower itself even further. The Matrix beca me a Frankenstein. The c reated o r projected though t field h ad accessed an energy source to b ecome a creator and p rojector of its own illusory reality. As these words were being spok en, I was shown scenes from the Disney cartoon movie, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in which the sorcerer had created an entity to do all the jobs he didn't want to do , but then the entity h ad taken ov er events and b ecome the sorcerer's controller. Subconscious mind created the Matrix/Time Loop as a predictable, familiar 'world', but it had lost control. Both subconscious and conscious 'five-sense' mind were subject to the manipulation o f this now self-aware 'entity' that the Matrix had b ecome. \"Humanity is controlled by d ece ption?\" the voice said. \"No, humanity is controlled by self- dece ption.\" The subconscious had created the prison from its disconn ected state of self-dece ption and no w it and the c onscious mind were sitting in a cell of their own making, with the 'cell' dictating events. The reason why the Matrix p rojection n eeds the e nergy o f fear to empower itself is beca use it is fear, self-aware fear, the voice said. It had b een created o riginally by the fear of subconscious mind and, as projected fear, this is the only energy source the Matrix entity could acce ss and absorb. The more fear its manipu lations generate through wars, conflict, stress, guilt and aggression etc., the greater its power to increase this cycle of fear produ ction. Reptilian programs The ultimate manipulator of the Matrix and its five-sense Time Loop, the voice said, was the very fabric of the Matrix itself and its power source was the c onsciousness trapped within its vibrational walls. The Matrix was a self-ware e ntity that was kno wing ly manipu lating to ensure its own survival by g enerating the events'- - \" necessary to p rodu ce the fear that empowered it. Humans were indeed 'batteries' or power stations for the Matrix and we were providing the power to maintain our own p rison. The Reptilians did 'exist', said the voice, but they were holographic though t projections of the Matrix v ery much like the a gents or 'sentient programs' that manipulate in the Matrix movies. They could either operate as a reptilian projection o r hide behind an apparently 'human' form, just as the sentient programs morph in and ou t of different human forms in the movies. Either way, the Reptilians and o ther projected agents of the Matrix were not 'real' in consciousness terms; they were projections, though t fields or highly sophisticated software programs. The e xistence of such though t-projected h olographic phenomena is now supported by scientific research and experiment, as we shall see. Holograms are projections of energy o r 'light' that appear to the observer to be a three-dimensional form, but in fact they are a series of codes and wave patters that only take on the illusion o f 3-D w hen a laser is s hon e upon them. Or in the ca se of the holographic projections in the Matrix, when they are observed into illusory reality by the human mind. In the next chapter I will explain how this works. It is s o simple. As I was told with g reat clarity in my second ayahuasca e xperience, the whole of five-sense reality is a holographic illusion that only exists in a 'solid' form beca use the human mind/brain makes it appear that way. The '3-D' world o f landscape, seas, buildings and hu man bodies, only exists in that form when we look at it! Otherwise it is a mass of vibrational fields and codes. In the movies, the Matrix is depicted from the outside as a series of green nu mbers and codes, while inside it is experienced as the sort of world we think we live in - moun tains, streets, cars, people a nd so on . That is a good analogy, I kno w this all sounds fantastic a t first hearing, but these themes are now being confirmed at the c utting edge of scientific research. The voice said that when the Reptilians absorbed hu man fear they were a bsorbing it for the Matrix itself beca use they are projections of the Matrix. But they were not aware of this. Indeed, the Reptilians, other"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 195 'demonic e ntities', and the Illuminati hierarchy were not aware of who their ultimate master really was - the Matrix itself. The manipulators were a lso b eing manipulated. The Reptilian 'sentient programs' did not have human emotion, the voice said, beca use they were just that, 'sentient programs', and are not conscious in the way hu mans are conscious. \"If you p rogramm ed a c omputer to k ill children, would that computer have a ny emotional problems with that?\" the voice a sked. No, it would just follow the programming b eca use c omputers do no t have e motion. They do what they are programm ed to do. It was the same with the Illuminati and the 'Reptilians' - they were, in effect, like highly sophisticated computer software. They were like digital people implanted in the mov ies along side human actors. They appear to b e the same, but they are not. Unemotional computers can p rocess information faster and more efficiently than human conscious minds in a disconn ected state a nd, in the same way, the sentient program projections of the Matrix h ave been able to ou t-fox and ou t-think humans. But this can o nly continue until humanity remembers who it really is and where it really comes from, and reconn ect with its true a nd infinite self. Then the projected ho lographic manipulators will have intelligence a kin to coun ting b eads compared with h uman po tential and, as I was told, that moment is fast approaching. This is what happened symbolically to the Neo character in the first Matrix movie when h e a wakened to the illusion o f life a nd death and the dream world h e had b een living in. Once he reached that point of reconn ected awareness, the agents, the sentient programs, all-powerful until then, were sudd enly no p roblem to ov ercome. \"Love does not abandon\" The voice said that the Matrix, and p articularly the five-sense Time Loop , had b ecome so v ibrationally dense, and the imprisoned consciousness s o lost in the illusion, that the Infinite One was intervening in the 'game'. Control of the Matrix and the Time Loop were in the process of being dismantled so that entrapped consciousness could return 'home\"' to conscious reconn ection with the Infinite. I heard many times in my a1tered ~ but \"self-aware state: \"Love does not abandon .\" There were no chosen on es whom 'God' had selected. There was no 'God' as humans perceived it, on ly the infinity o r 'Oneness' of existence. \"All would be gathered in\", the voice said, \"and no sheep would b e left in the field alone.\" The Infinite was the balance of all things, while the Matrix was calculated and manipulated imbalance, in which Oneness had b een divided into p olarities and du alities of 'light' and 'dark', 'good ' and 'bad', male a nd female a nd all the rest. These polarised states of duality no t only o ffered the massive potential for fear and conflict, they also ensured that such imbalance a nd d ivision would disconn ect mind from a sense of balance a nd Oneness - the Infinite. Without such d ivision and p olarised reality there c ould b e no Matrix. The process of removing the Matrix control was well advanced, the voice said. Expressions of the Infinite had entered the Matrix and especially its densest level, the Time Loop , to anchor the e nergy that would b reak up the fear vibration that held it together. These e xpressions of the Infinite taking h uman form had no t been aware of their role for most of their 'phy sical' lives and many were still not. This was because they h ad to experience the e motional and mental states that held hu manity in disconn ected servitude a nd in d oing so attune themselves to the low vibrational frequencies of these states of being. When this was don e the Infinite c ould feed its energy o f Oneness and b alance through such 'people' and transform those mental and emotional frequencies on which the Matrix and the Time Loop d epend. This is represented in the c over of the book by the hole in the Time Loop /Matrix. After the first session o f ayahuasca in which these matters were a ddressed, I recalled a comm unication I had b een g iven through a psychic in 1990 that said: '\" feel you a re sensing n ow the e nergies c oming in, the en ergies s urroundin g your planet. This is c ausing many of you to a sk que stions. It is c ausing many of you to re-evaluate completely y our way of life, where you feel you wish to go, what you want to do . It is causing tremendous uphea vals. Some o f these u phea vals are very c onfusing, very distressing, very disturbing. Some pe ople in partnerships are finding they c an no longer continue in those p artnerships because their partners c anno t tune into what they are tuning into. It is causing a great dea l of disturbance ... \" ... As the consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those o f you light workers who are working to raise your consciousness, you will be ab le to hold more and more refined vibrations, and so we will be ab le to u se you a s a catalyst to be ab le to feed in more and more en ergies.\" This was a more basic version o f what I learned in these a yahuasca experiences. Valerie Hunt, professor of kinesiology at the University o f California in Los Angeles, has developed the use of techno logy to measure the human energy field and this has confirmed that a person's state of mind affects their vibrational speed o r frequency. Those focussed on ly on five-sense reality are the lowest and the more people a re using their higher senses the higher the frequency o f their energy field. 3 This is the reason for the phrase ... \"As the consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those of you light workers who are working to raise you r consciousness, you will be a ble to h old more a nd more refined v ibrations.\" Or, as the voice told me, the more the Infinite e xpressed itself in the Matrix through its incarnate a spects, the more people would b egin"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 196 to feel its manifestation and b e transformed by its harmony and b alance to awaken and remember who and what they really are. The veil of igno rance would lift from their vibrational 'eyes' and they would remember they were all that exists - the One. This is the transformation - the 'Truth Vibrations' - that I was told about when my mind was first blown in 1990 . As I have travelled the world since then, I have seen ho w this phenomenon h as become so apparent and continues to g ather pace by the day. I was told that the transformation o f entrapped consciousness, from the illusion o f disconn ected limitation to reconn ected infinity, is now happening. The voice e mphasised that this was not a 'maybe' and that we were seeing the last desperate death throes of Matrix control. \"00 you think the Infinite is going to h ave a problem with George Bush?\" it said, laughing. This did no t mean that we just had to sit around and wait for all this to h appen. We were the Infinite a nd we all had roles to p lay in the transformation o f this reality. The Infinite was expressing itself at all levels of the Matrix as those in conscious awareness expo sed its illusions. I was told that the most important level of the Matrix that had to be transformed was the 'five-sense' Tune Loop . This was the densest level and it acted as an 'anchor', or like a light that captivates the moths, and it provided most of the 'fear energy' that sustained the Matrix entity. The transformation was being b rought abou t by infusing Infinite Oneness into the vibrational concrete a nd fear - the 'freeze vibration' I was told abou t in 1990 . This was why p eople were c hanging and this would continue a nd increase a pace until we were experiencing a very d ifferent reality to the one we currently 'see'. Words were only n ece ssary to k eep the five-sense 'mind' occupied while the e nergy infusions did their work, the voice told me. I was shown a scene of myself standing on a stage in a theatre. I was saying nothing the a udience were looking at each o ther in b ewilderment. The voice said, laugh ing : \"You o nly speak words because if you d id no t, the a udience would b e sitting there asking 'when is he going to start?' - not kno wing that you already h ad!\" Unseen energy was the real transformer, not human language. That was only to k eep the five-sense mind happy . More a nd more people a re waking up and this is why: a vibrational change is unfolding ever more quickly. The voice said the reason there was such an effort und erway to imprison h umanity even further in the fast emerging global fascist state or New World Order was a desperate a ttempt to ho ld the game together and stop the awakening p eople - especially through the microchips that are designed to artificially supp ress the quickening vibrations of awakening humanity. What the manipulators did no t realise, I was told, is what they are dealing with. They are igno rant of the true background to the 'game' in which they, too, are pawns. The voice said: \"This transformation is not a maybe, it is not something that might happen o r we hope will happen if things go a ccording to ·plan'. It is happ ening n ow and the power and speed of the change will become ever more profound a J:1d ob vious. What you a re seeing is the last desperate a ttempt of the 'Matrix' to stop the inevitable, that's all. The transformation from prison to p aradise is a do ne d eal.\" Remember who y ou are These words were though t fields decoded by my mind and so the langu age is s omething like I would u se in my o wn speec h. An Italian o r an Egyp tian would d ecode them in their langu age, as I explained earlier. On the second n ight I took an increased do se of ayahuasca a nd at first the feeling o f screaming and n ausea returned. This time I was with the rest of the group , and as I began to enter an altered state, I asked Zoe if he would come with me back to my room to avoid disrupting the others. There I was, screaming ou t more frustration and h eaving without being sick. I stood ou t on the balcony looking ou t at the trees, heaving into the darkness. From out of nowhere I said to my n auseous body \"1 love you\" and with that the nausea left me and the need to scream in frustration lifted from m e a lso. It sound s cheesy, but that is what happened. I felt calm and at peace again and went back to the round hou se to rejoin the others. The most profound night of my life was abou t to b egin. As I lay do wn with my eyes closed, I began to see the swirling colours and images again and for a time they had a very Chinese feel abou t them. Then I began to h ear a voice as clear as can b e. Not some distant 'what did it say?' type of voice, but a loud and po werful one, more so than anything I had experienced. It was female a nd spok e with g reat dignity, assurance a nd clarity. \"David\", it said\" \"We a re going to take you to where you come from, so you can remember who you are.\" With that I was taken to a realm of indescribable bliss. There was no 'time' and there was no 'place ~ . Everything just was. I had no body , I was only consciousness, and I was everything. There were no d ivisions, no p olarities, no black and-white, no u s and them. I was infinite, but I was also completely self-aware, as an 'individual' with my o wn p oint of observation within the whole. This is what we all are a nd if only p eople c ould experience the bliss of Oneness the world o f the five-senses would b e transformed in an instant. The e nergy was not vibrating as it does in the Matrix. I experienced it as either stillness or as the waves of an o cean moving in slow motion and in p erfect harmony . \"This is the Infinite, David\", the voice said, \"This is where you come from and this is where you shall return.\" The following words then b egan to repeat over and ov er in my mind: "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 197 \"Infinite Lo ve is the on ly truth - everything e lse is illusion; Infinite Lo ve is the on ly truth - everything e lse is illusion; Infinite L ove is the only truth - everything e lse is illusion.\" At one point I began to form a question in my mind I was going to say: \"You really mean everything?\" But before the though t could form, the voice interrupted:\"Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion; no buts, no exceptions, that's it.\" This word 'love' has conno tations in which it is often p erceived as weak o r naive. I hear people say, \"You n eed more than love, mate.\" But let me define what is meant by love in the c ontext of Infinite Love. It is the balance of all. Infinite Oneness is the only truth, everything else is illusion would b e a nother way o f saying it. Therefore, Infinite 'Love' is also Infinite Intelligence, Infinite Knowledge, Infinite Everything. I was told how humanity h ad b een manipulated to identify itself with illusory 'personalities' and no t as the Infinite that we a re. This had trapped p eople in the illusions of a disconnected state. The voice would return to this theme, as it comm un icated with me c onstantly through the hou rs that night. “Why do you think y ou n eeded to scream and try to throw Up? ” 11 I was asked. “ Do you feel any frustration o r anger in this place?” No, I did n ot. “ Do you h ave a ny worries or fear or guilt where you are now?” No, I didn't, there was only h armony, peace , love a nd bliss. “Frustration, anger, fear, guilt and p ain are only illusions, figments of disconn ected mind \", the voice said. “ They don 't exist except in you r imagination. II It went on: “ Do you think the Infinite you are now experiencing n eeds to throw Up?” No. “ Do you think the Infinite e ver gets il1?” No o f course not, these states are only illusions of the c onditioned mind. II Later in the night I began to feel a little nauseous again and imm ediately the voice said: \"Where is y our nausea coming from? Do you think the Infinite is feeling nau seou s now? So you must be iden tifying with your body. It's an illusion, David, your body is an illusion, and so must be the n ausea you think y ou a re feeling in your body. If your body does not exist how can nausea o r pain? These a re illusions and they only exist in the minds of those caugh t in the Matrix.\" 'Time' to confuse With that, the nausea left me, never to return. The voice told me more a bou t the Matrix and the Time Loop . It said that the illusion o f 'time' was necessary to maintain imprisoned consciousness in a disconnected state. While people related to the movement.9f 'time', they could not relate to the Infinite One that was 'no time'. The Matrix entity, 'self-aware fear'; had created an illusion o f time to trap its prey, its prisoners, in a state of disconnection in which they would forget who they were. I was told that while the five-sense Time Loop created the illusion o f 'time' moving 'forward' most powerfully within the Matrix, the other 'nonphy sical' levels also h ad v ersions of this. The voice said that human p sychics and mediums may make c ontact with entities that say their realms do no t have 'time', as we kno w it, and those who h ave had so-called 'out-of- body ' and 'near death experiences', may say that in their out-of-body state there was no 'time'. But the very vibrational nature of the Matrix was different to the truly 'no time' state of the Infinite a nd in a sense manipulated 'time' was prevalent throughou t the Matrix. I got the impression that t he \"detail of what was meant here was beyond the a bility o f human langu age t0express. The out-of-body experiencers often spok e of being in a place of 'no time' beca use what they were feeling was s uch a different version o f 'time' to that of the Time Loop . It appeared that they were experiencing 'no time' when it was a different version o f 'time'. The Time Loop p rodu ced the most fear to sustain the Matrix b eca use the five-sense reality most fundamentally identified with time a nd the movement from 'past' to 'future'. Those e xperiencing the Time Loop were the most thoroug hly disconn ected from their no-time self, the Infinite. Everything in the Time Loop was geared to indo ctrinating the 'time' illusion. “ Do you think the Infinite gets old?” a sked the voice. “Human minds are programm ed to b elieve that their bodies age a nd so they do and this s trengthens the illusion more than anything o f passing from past to future.\" Nothing aged in truth b eca use there was no time, no p ast and no future. Only illusion d raws a pension, it said. DNA also carried the programming of aging that the mind accepts as its reality, but DNA was also an illusion. \"Do you think the Infinite has DNA or worries abou t its cancer gene? Illusion !\" At one stage during the night I saw the Moon appearing abov e the c loud s and the voice said: \"Ah the Moon , the Moon , how the p oets wax lyrical abou t the Moon, the Moon. illusion! The Moon is a holograph ic projection to g ive the illusion of the movement from past to future, the passage o f 'time'. That is what it is there for, to capture the mind in the time illusion. Do you think the Infinite ne eds the Sun to survive? Do you see a Sun in this place you a re n ow? You a re the Infinite so why do you need the Sun to sustain you? You are the Infinite a nd a ll is the Infinite. Why do you feel heat from the rays of the Sun? Because that is what the Matrix mind and b ody is' programm ed a nd cond itioned to feel and so it doe s. It is all ill usion. The Sun a nd Moon a re p rojected holograms to p rovide the illusion of night and da y - the movement of 'time'.\" "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 198 I was told that what we c all the universe is a holographic illusion akin to looking up at the 'sky' projected on the ceiling o f a planetarium. The only difference was that in the 'universe' the projections appeared to b e in 3 -D beca use they were '- - ~ holograms. The 'universe' was a figment of our cond itioned imagination, the voice said, and it was only p art of our reality b eca use we believed it was. The universe was also far smaller than p eople perceived. \"Look at the sky in a planetarium and it seems s o v ast, yet it only goes as high as the ce iling.\" Then the voice said: \"Do y ou think that's the Earth you 're lying on no w? Mmmm . Iluuu lsiom!\" As with everything in the Time Loop and throughou t the Matrix, the Earth was a holographic projection and so was its illusory' 'surface'. \"You are lying on the Earth no w only b eca use you think you are\", the voice said. If you are new to all this and think ho w unbelievable a nd fantastic it is, you are going to b e a mazed ho w much scientific e vidence is now coming to light to confirm that this is correct. \"Remember always\", said the voice, \"Infinite Love is the only truth, everything else is illusion everything.\" It went on: \"If it vibrates, it is illusion. The Infinite does not vibrate; it is the harmony and Oneness of all. Only illusion vibrates - that which is created by the imagination and d elusion o f mind.\" Laws of illusion I was told that the 'laws' of phy sics were also illusions. \"There a re no laws of phy sics\", said the voice. \"The scientists create illusory 'laws' to measure an illusory u niverse.\" There were no 'laws' of any k ind b eca use everything just is. \"Do you . think the Infinite needs 'laws' through which to express itself?\" The laws of phy sics and mathematics and all the others that 'gov ern' the phy sical and non -physical worlds were the creations of misguided mind. If the scientists believe in such 'laws' that will be their experience. Not beca use the laws exist, but beca use the scientists, and through them the people in g eneral, believe them to exist. and so they appear to. But this continues only un til someone c omes along and changes the belief, the collective reality, and then such 'laws' cease to apply. It has been shown again and again that the beliefs of the scientists performing an experiment will affect the outcome of the e xperiment. The nearest thing there is to a 'law' is this: what you b elieve is what you will see a nd experience. The voice e xplained ho w w hat we perceive to b e a 'solid' world o nly exists beca use we believe it does. This 'world' is not 'out there', it is 'in here' - in ou r minds. Scientific e xperiments have shown that we do no t see up to 50 %, and more, of what comes 'through ' our eyes because it is filtered ou t by the temporal lobes of the brain on the basis of our conditioned b elief before it gets to .the visual cortex, the point at which we actually 'see'. It is our brain that sees, not our eyes. The eyes only p rov ide information and it is the mind that decides what to make of it. So whatever our mind/brain is conditioned to see or not see, it will. When we think we are in a 'conscious' state going about our lives, we a re, in fact, experiencing a dream every b it as much as those we e xperience in sleep. It's just a different dream. Other levels of me might well be saying to eac h o ther right now that they h ave just had this s trange dream in which they were sitting at a c omputer writing something abou t drink ing a plant and living in a Time Loop ! What we think we 'see' is just a dream infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion. The Illuminati (i.e. ultimately the Matrix entity) use this und erstanding o f the mind to manipu late our sense of reality and maintain the population in ongoing control. They tell peop le what they shou ld see a nd so they do. This is the fund amental role· of the 'norms' (official 'truths') I have spok en and written abou t so widely. It is also why the a uthorities are desperate to remove or discredit those who challenge the norms beca use, in doing so, they o ffer another vision o f possibilit y that allows people to 'see' a different reality. I ain’t got nobody Our bodies are holograph ic illusions that did no t really exist in the way that we think we see and experience them, the voice said. We only h ave to eat and d rink b eca use we a nd ou r bod ies are programm ed (through conditioning and the DNA ) to b elieve that we do. We only h ave to b reathe for the same reason. Yes, if we stopp ed b reathing we would 'die', but this was not because we have to d ie. It only h appened b eca use our conditioned minds and bo dies believe that will be the outcome a nd so that is what they create. “ Do you think the Infinite sits down to dinner?\" the voice said, “ Do you think the Infinite has to b reathe or it will die?\" So why, the voice a sked, do those in the Time Loop ? Answer: because they identify who they are a nd their sense of possibilit y with b eing a phy sical 'personality' subo rdinate to illusory 'laws' and no t with b eing what they really are - the Infinite 'One'. The voice offered an example of the c hasm between p erceived reality and infinite self: \"Why do you ne ed to fly around in a ircraft? You are point A and you a re po int B and you a re everything in between . Why then do you n eed to u se an aircraft to fly through yourself?\" 'Law of the Wild' - iIIuuuu sion!"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 199 The 'laws' of nature were a lso illusions, said the voice. \"Why do p eople have such a problem und erstanding why a 'loving God' would create 'laws' of nature, laws of the wild, in which everything was based on k illi ng and survival?\" There a ppeared to b e such a c ontradiction b etween 'Divine love' and the carnage and fear written into the very fabric of 'nature'. But there was no contradiction, the voice said, beca use the 'laws of nature' were the c reation o f the Matrix, not the Infinite. \"Do y ou think the Infinite, where you are now, would wish to see a nything suffer and live in fear, never mind create a structure in which this happened as a matter of course?\" Nature was another holographic projection that was only 'real' beca use we were conditioned to b elieve it was. The 'laws' of the natural world reflected the state of being o f its creator, the Matrix entity; a state of fear and d esperation to survive. There were, the voice said, some a pparently beautiful expressions of nature on 'Planet Earth' and so long as we realised they were illusions they could b .: enjoyed. But we shou ld b e ca reful not to b ecome mesmerised by what we see-on Earth o r we would b ecome like a moth h ypno tised by a light, trapped by illusions that held u s in a disconn ected state. The message was enjoy what you see, but remember that what you 'see' is merely what you think y ou see. An illusion can only control you when you think it is real. The new age M atrix If you are interested in 'New A ge' though t or some of the Eastern religions and p hilosophies the next bit might be a bit of a surprise. The voice e xplained to me that the vast majority o f 'incarnate( consciousness that left the 'phy sical' body at what \" we c all 'death' did no t consciously reconn ect with the Infinite. Instead it moved to o ther 'non -physical' dimensions of the Matrix. Consciousness may h ave withdrawn from the Time Loop, but it was still in the fly trap; albeit a less dense e xpression o f it. Reincarnation was the c ycle of consciousness moving in and ou t of the Time Loop from other levels of the Matrix. The concept of reincarnation is another creation o f the Matrix entity to h old consciousness in a c ycle of se ~ ih1d e while believing it is 'evolving' through experience in line with the New A ge belief. \"Do you think the Infinite has to reincarnate?\" the voice said. \"Consciousness in the Matrix is also the Infinite, so why do es that have to reincarnate?\" It doesn't, it just believes that it does. As with the saying \"death is no cure for ignorance\", so it was the case that consciousness in o ther levels of the Matrix was also trapped by illusions. When consciousness withdrew from the 'phy sical' body it did n ot become imm ediately re-enlightened. That depended on its reality. In the five-sense realm what we think we should see is what we a ppear to see a nd experience. This, the voice e xplained, is what also h appened in o ther fr equencies of the Matrix. If consciousness left the body b elieving totally that it was going to the heaven o f Jesus and the Christian version o f God, this would b e its experience; that is what it would 'see' because that is what it believed it would see. It was the same with the other religious beliefs and the Matrix maintained a Christian 'heaven', Islamic 'heaven', Hindu 'heaven' and Jewish 'heaven', etc. But these were nothing more than figments of expectation. Only that which was free of cond itioned b elief was able to transcend the vibratory illusions of the Matrix and b ecome c onsciously on e with the Infinite. Belief was the prison and o ther levels of the Matrix were different levels of illusion. This meant that the overwhelming majority o f information 'channelled' through p sychics in the Time Loop was from consciousness s till caugh t in the Matrix. This might know more than those in the Time Loop d ensity, but it was s till in the web o f illusion. I was s hown a picture of people symbolically d ropping from the sky on to a footpath across a field. The voice said that because c onsciousness in the Matrix was caugh t in a c ycle of moving in and ou t of the Time Loop through 'reincarnation', they were not only conditioned by the beliefs of one 'phy sical' lifetime. They were cond itioned by endless experiences in the Time Loop and b etween these 'phy sical' excursions they were in another form of illusory state. So they were a lready cond itioned even as they returned to the Time Loop reality for still more c ondition ing. This was why hu manity d ropped into the c ond itioned, servile state so easily. They h ad b een there many times before. As these words were being spok en, I saw the footpath being worn away by the trampling feet going over the same ground un til the path looked like a sort of record g roov e. It went ever deeper and the figures walking the path went down and do wn into the dark 'groov e' until they disappeared. \"Is it any wond er that humans look up for their God?\" the voice said. \"It is the only place where they can see a ny light!\" The voice told me how 'New A ge' though t and some philosoph ies of the East and n ative peoples were more enlightened than those of the purely Time Loop religions and sciences of mainstream society. The 'New Age' reality understood that the 'phy sical' realm was only on e dimension o f existence a nd there were many more beyond the vibrational walls of human senses. That was good , but what was not und erstood is that these other vibrating dimensions were still levels of the Matrix. They p rovided the c onstant 'supply' of consciousness to inhabit the Time Loop and g enerate the fear necessary to k eep the Matrix 'alive'. New Age beliefs in a 'Great White Brotherhood o r an 'Ashtar Comm and' comm unicating with their chosen p eople were manipulation ~ of the Time Loop from other levels of the Matrix. In fact, some were e ven comm unications from within the Time Loop planted in the minds of the 'psychic' by mind-control and"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 200 forms of techno log ical 'telepathy'. When p sychics, like those in stage shows and television, were comm unicating with the dece ased relatives of the a udience, they were contacting levels of the Matrix v ery close to the Time Loop reality. Their other-fr equency comm unicators may realise that there are other 'worlds' beyond the 'phy sical', but they were still in the realms of Matrix d elusion. They comm unicated abou t going to 'Halls of Learning' in their non-phy sical world and ho w the Earth was a spiritual 'university' where people ca me to learn some tough lessons and work ou t their 'karma'. This was illusion, the voice said, total illuu uuusioll! \"DO you think the Infinite has to go to schoo l to learn anything when it kno ws everything there is to kno w?\" the voice said. As for 'karma', the idea that you experience what you h ave made others experience, the voice a sked: \"Why should the Infinite have to experience what it has made itself experience? \" The idea of karma was a Matrix manipu lation to indoctrinate beliefs in the passage of 'time' - it's my k arma from a past life or I am building k arma for the future - and to maintain p eople in a state of guilt and self loathing. \"Infinite Love does not judge itself or loathe itself - these a re illusions of disconnection.\" What sign are you? Er, all of them The voice then turned to astrology. Yes, it said, astrology appeared to 'work' in the sense that certain types of 'personality' and traits could b e predicted by the illusory 'time' and 'place ' of a person's birth in the 'year' (a c lassic illusion o f the Time Loop). But why was this? Astrology 'read' the vibrational fields of the Time Loop and while it could do this effectively in skilled h ands, it was s till a Matrix illusion that was based on division not Oneness. Astrology, said the voice, was a c reation o f the Matrix to manipulate people to identify still more powerfully with their illusory 'personality' - I am a Taurus, a Leo, a Capricorn o r whatever. It emphasised the idea of division, of parts, not the whole. \"00 you think the Infinite has its astrology read?\" asked the voice. \"00 y ou think it consults a psychic a bou t its 'future' or visits a tarot card reader?\" These were a ll identifications with the 'phy sical' personality and such 'forward' predictions were peering do wn the Time Loop, that's all. Psychics were e xtremely u seful in showing p eop le that 'death' is an illusion and the best of them - those c onn ecting with the Infinite beyond the Matrix - could b ring p rofound and mind-freeing information into the Time Loop , it said. But if people believed what the psychic or tarot reader said would h appen they could make it happen. What people believed was what they 'saw' and experienced. In fact, we all have the power to create whatever reality we c hoo se. As I was hearing these words, I was shown a symbolic scene of the Infinite sitting at a table when someone brough t the morning paper. The Infinite turned to the list of birth signs on the a strology p age a nd said: \"Oh my g oodn ess, this will take me a ll morning b eca use I am all of them.\" Since that time) have refused to identify with my 'astrology ' and instead h ave identified on ly with b eing all that is. If I don 't identify with b eing a 'Taurus' or 'Aries' or 'David Icke' I begin to release myself fr om such influences and limitations. The New A ge a nd mainstream religions have a belief in the e xistence of 'light' and 'dark'. But there was no 'light' or 'dark', the voice said. These were illusions. The belief that light was needed to b alance the darkness was utterly misguided and a belief in the e xistence of 'light' was as divisive a s a belief in the e xistence of 'dark'. To b elieve in the 'light' means you must also b elieve in the 'dark' and so b elief in the 'light' also creates the illusion o f its perceived p olarity, dark. Once more these were figments of disconn ected mind. Light and d ark were illusions of the Matrix d esigned to cause division, conflict and fear. The Infinite was not li ght any more than it was dark. It was the balance of all things. It is not 'good ' nor 'bad', 'light' nor 'dark', black no r white, male nor female, it just is, the Oneness of all. Neither were there a ny 'demons', the voice said. These were projections from the mind o f the Matrix and the c reation o f human minds that accepted their existence. \"Demons only manifest in minds that believe in them.\" If I nfinite Love was the only truth and everything else was illusion, how could d emons be a nything, but il lusions? They were holograms projected from the imagination o f fr ightened and manipulated minds. The idea that the 'light' must 'fight' the 'dark' and the demons only reinforced the belief in their perceived existence. There was no need to 'fight' anything and those who d id so were only giving what they fight more power by confirming it was 'real'. If people didn't like their life e xperience they shou ld p erceive a nother reality and the manifestations of the present one would disappear. You don 't like your dream? Then d ream something else. Why a sk when you know? The voice e mphasised that to free ourselves from the illusions of the Matrix we had to identify with being the Infinite a nd no t a fragment of mind stuffed inside a body . There was no David Icke, only Infinite consciousness. If we relate to b eing the Infinite a nd no t some hologram dreamed into imaginary 'existence', the Matrix will no longer control us. Stop asking qu estions, the voice said, and start kno wing the a nswers. It didn't mean rhetorical questions to illustrate a point, but those that come from the belief that we don 't kno w something. \"You are the Infinite so you know everything; do you think the Infinite a sks questions when it kno ws all there is to kno w?\" Whenever we identified with limitation, ignorance a nd ou r illusory p ersonality"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 201 we were disconn ecting from the Infinite that kno ws all and is all. When we a sk qu estions we a re accepting that we don 't kno w the a nswer. Would the Infinite do that? Stop asking the question and y ou will kno w the a nswer, the voice said, and, modifying a line from the first Matrix movie, it added: \"It's not the question that drives you mad, it is asking it.\" The psychiatrist, R.D. Laing, once said: \"If I do no t know I kno w, I think I do no t know.\" People so lack confidence in themselves that they t09!< to o thers to tell them what to think, but if they could free their minds of such doub t and limitation, they would simply 'kno w'. Don't think it, know it. Don't ask it, know it\" Dreaming our lives away Since Brazil, I have und erstood more a bou t the nature of our dream-world reality. I walked along a beac h on on e occa sion in an altered state on a beautiful sunny d ay thanks to 'magic mushrooms'. It is the only other time I have taken anything to acce ss an altered reality. The voice said to me: \"Look around you, does it not seem like a dream? Does it not feel like a dream that you h ave in sleep?\" It certainly did and later the 'memory' of the e xperience was extremely d ream-like. Did it happen? Was it really all a dream? It was like walking through a painting, a reality 'bub ble', and laugh ter came far easier than it does in the purely five- sense state. What I found interesting was the way that 'this world' phenomena c ould b ring me out of the altered state in an instant. I was walking along enjoying my expanded reality when I saw a police ca r and began to think o f the a uthoritarian system .. Imm ediately I was out of my altered state a nd b ack 'here'. Later I began to think abou t something relating to fear and the same happened. Whenever I checked the 'time' on my watch I was kicked ou t of the a ltered state as I related to the reality o f the Time Loop . This allowed me to und erstand more of how the Time Loop /Matrix h olds us in a manipulated reality and why the system is structured as it is. Interest in p sychoactive substances exploded in the sixties with the use of drugs like LSD, but they largely beca me an escape from this reality rather than a bridge to a new one. I don 't want to escape this reality, I want to change it, and experiencing altered states can h elp u s to und erstand the game we a re dealing with. Those who h ave studied the e ffects of drugs like LSD from this perspective have certainly learned a great deal more a bou t reality than they would o therwise have don e. One is Stanislav Grof, the a uthor of The Holotrop ic Mind,4 and a former professor at John Hopk ins University School of Medicine. He was a found er of the International Transpersonal Association and h as developed a means of taking p eople into Hered states called Holotropic Breathwork. Grof was a conv inced materialist and atheist until he began studying the e ffects of LSD in the 1950 s as he sough t to establish if there were any medical benefits. He was to continue his research for decades to come. In h is first experience on LSD, he had what he ca lled \"an extraordinary encoun ter with my subconscious\". He realised imm ediately that the unyielding 'truth' of the scientific e stablishment, taugh t as fact in the schoo ls and u niversities, was a fantasy: \"Traditional science ho lds the be lief that organic matter and life grew from the chemical ooze of the primeval ocean solely through the random interactions of atoms and molecules. Similarly, it is argued that matter was organized into living cells, and cells into complex multicellular organisms with central nervous sys tems, solely by acciden t and 'natural selection'. And somehow, along with these e xplanations, the assumptions that consciousness is a b y-product of material processes occurring in the b rain has become one of the most important metaph ysical tene ts of the Western worldview . \"As mode rn science d iscovers the p rofound interactions. between creative intelligen ce and a ll levels of reality, this s implistic image o f the un iverse be comes increasingly untenable. The p robability that human consciousness and ou r infinitely c omplex universe could ha ve come into e xistence through random interactions of inert matter has aptly been compared to that of a tornado b lowing through a junkyard and a ccidentally assembling a 7 47 jumbo jet.\" Itzhak Bentov calls this mind set the 'giraffe synd rome' in his book, Stalking the Wild Pendu lum. The term is inspired by the story o f a man who sees a giraffe for the first time with its enormous height, neck and legs. It is s uch a c hallenge to h is reality that he dismisses it as impossible a nd rejects the idea that such an animal could exist. Stanislav Grof conducted some 4,000 LSD sessions and 20 ,000 with his Holotropic Breathwork, which involves a c ombination o f breathing techniques, sound, bodywork and artistic e xpression. This has, Grof says, an \"extraordinary po tential for opening the way for exploring the entire spectrum of the inner world.\" What fascinated h im were the remarkable states of consciousness his subjects and clients have been able to access. They h ave e xperienced what it is like to b e a nimals and plants, and they h ave described intricate details of their genetics and b ehaviour that later proved to b e 100 % correct. They h ave even experienced b eing an atom or a blood cell, seeing inside the Sun, and what it was like for them in the womb and the birth canal. Others have said they b eca me the c onsciousness of the whole cosmos and I kno w exactly what that is like myself. How w as this possible? 'Because we are the cosmos, we a re every cell and atom, and there is no 'past' or 'future'. The five-sense prison - the Time Loop - disconnects us from the und erstanding that we a re all One. Indeed this perception o f division is the prison."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 202 In these a ltered states beyond the five-senses we ca n regain ou r conscious conn ection to the Infinite a nd experience a ny expression o f the Infinite - anything in all existence. Look at the ocean. We give it different names like the Pacific or the Indian, as we give ourselves names like Bill Jones or David Icke. But these 'different' oceans are the same water, as we a re the same c onsciousness. So where is the ocean? Is it crashing on the c oast of India? Is it lapping on a. beach in Jamaica? Is it the Roaring Forties or the South China Sea? It is all of them and so it can experience a ll of them. We a re the infinite c onsciousness that is everything. Where a re we? Are we the tree in the garden? Are we the forest down the road? Are we the Sun or the sky? Are we the reflection we see in the mirror or the raindrops on our face?

When you p lace a droplet back in the water, where does the droplet end and the ocean start? There is no division, the droplet becomes the ocean. This kno wledge has been comm unicated by the e nlightened throughout human existence, but official science has denied its validity. The a ncient Greek ph ilosoph er, Plato, said that human b eings were like people sitting in a cave a lways facing a wall. The universe was the shadows projected on to the wall, illusions that the people mistake for reality. The only.reqlity.9r truth was the light - consciousness - that made the shadows possible the a ncient Vedic works of India make the same point. The e ighth century Hindu mystic Shankara, said: \"This entire universe of which we speak and think is nothing but Brahman [infinite c onsciousness]. Brahman d wells beyond the range of Maya [illusion]. There is nothing else.\" 6 I had k nown this s ince my transformation b egan in Peru, but in the Amazon I experienced it like never before.

In the long run it is far more dangerous to adhere to illusion than to face what the actual fact is. Physicist David Bohm It's funny ho w the public a nd media a re quite willing to acce pt lies pedalled by the politicians without any demand for 'proof' and y et they insist on p roof fr om anyone c hallenging the official version o f reality. The official 'truth' of September 11th is one such case. A schoo lboy could take the story apart. But when faced with o ther explanations for these e vents, and for life itself, the same people who accept this crap withou t question scream: \"Where's the proof?\" \"That's all very well, mate, but how can you conv ince me if you don 't have the e vidence to p rove it? I can't believe what hasn't been p roved, can I?\" Oh, but people do; and they go on d oing so all their lives. Some points to make here. First, why can't we 'feel' and 'kno w' our reality instead o f insisting that the c ond itioned and manipulated mind must be the only arbiter of 'truth' through the production o f evidence that it believes to b e 'proof'? What is 'proof', anyway? Proof is only that which the c onditioned mind acce pts to b e so. Billions are c onv inced that the official version o f 9/11 is true because of the 'proof' revealed by the United States gov ernment. After all, didn't they find a passport from one of the hijackers that had miraculously survived the fireball to b e found in the street? Well, actually, no they didn't beca use that was a ·lie. But the FBI named the 19 h ijackers didn't they? No, they g ave us 19 n ames, at least seven o f which were found to b e still alive. But they p roved Bin Laden did it, surely? I heard them say that. Yes, exactly, we heard them say it and no thing more. They p rodu ced no 'proof' of anything, only the repetition o f their fairy tale that billions accepted as 'proof'. It was those usiI1g their 'hearts', their intuition, who kn ew something was very wrong with the official version even before a ny further investigation h ad b egun. Does what I reported in the last chapter 'feel' right intuitively even withou t 'scientific' suppo rt? Only you k now if it feels right to you o r not; you d on't need some guy with a fancy title a nd letters after his name to tell you what to think. What does you r heart say? That's all that matters. Second , the last thing I am trying to do is convince a nyon e of anything, that's not my intention or desire a t all. So why bo ther doing what I do? I want to und erstand what is going on and I believe it is right that everyon e shou ld h ave a ccess to all information available a nd no t just the version that suits those in power. What people make of it is their business, not mine. Third, even for those who still demand 'proof' for everything, there is an increasingly enormous amoun t of scientific suppo rt for the themes of the last chapter, fantastic a s they may h ave appeared to b e a t first hearing. Seeing is believing? \"I can't believe my eyes\", peop le say. Nor shou ld they b eca use the e yes don 't actually see. They are lenses that pass information to the visual cortex in the brain and o nly there do we 'see'. We 'see' with the brain, not with the e yes. \"I can't believe my b rain\" or \"I saw it with my o wn b rain\", would b e a better way o f putting it. On the way from the e yes to the visual cortex, the temporal lobes edit and reconstruct up to 50 % and more of this information and we only 'see' what the brain, with all its conditioned realities, decides it is seeing. In h is outstanding b ook, The Holographic Universe, Michael Talbot writes abou t the work o f neurophy siologist Karl Pribram and o thers: \"Pribram discovered that the visual information a monkey receives via its optic nerves does not travel directly into its visual cortex, but is first filtered through o ther areas of its brain. Numerous s tudies have shown that the same is true of human vision. Visual information en tering o ur brains is edited and modified by our temporal lobes before it is passed on to o ur visual cortices. Some studies s ugge st that less than 50 per cent of what we 'see' is actually based on information en tering ou r eyes. The remaining 50 p er cent plus is pieced toge ther out of our expectations of what the world shou ld look like (and p erhaps other sources such a s reality fields). The e yes may be the visual organs, but it is the b rain that sees.\" 1 "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 204 This is the journey o f information o r. 'light', as s ome ca ll it, when it passes from eye to b rain: Light enters the e ye by p assing through the outer, transparent layer called the c ornea; it goes on through the pupil, which gets bigger or smaller to allow in more or less light depending on the c ircumstances. This process is controlled by the c oloured p art of the e ye, the iris; from the pup il/iris it goes to the lens to b e focussed; next stop is the vitreous humor, a jelly like substance behind the lens; now the light/information strikes the retina that captures th ~ 'image' like the film in a ca mera. But this image recorded on the retina is upside-down and two-dimensional; it goes on to the optic nerve that sends the image through . the brain to the occipital lobe. Only now does the brain re-assemble the upside-down, two-dimensional image delivered by the e yes into the form we think we a re seeing. Scientists s ay the flip from 2-D to 3 -D is possible beca use the brain takes light/information from both eyes and combines them into one 3-D image, much like one of those 3-D picture viewers you can buy .2 I think it is more soph isticated than that, however. What a journey for everything we 'see'. Given these facts it is clear that our 'phy sical' reality is not constructed 'out there', but 'in h ere'. It is like looking ou t of a windo w and telling someone a version o f what you see that suits you r beliefs rather than what is really h appening. As s tudies have shown, for example, men and women h ave a real problem comm un icating acc urately with eac h o ther because what one says the other does not hear. A process of editing go es on in which they eac h 'hear' whatever suppo rts their conditioned b elief and p rejudice a bou t the other. I have seen television p rogramm es in which they filmed a conv ersation, asked each p articipant what the other had said, and then played b ack the recording. They h ave been stunn ed by ho w inacc urately they h eard what was said to them or the tone in which they spok e to the other. You will find the same in any argument between p eople with rigidly h eld b eliefs. Remember the polls of the American pub lic that revealed ho w many o f them believed b reathtaking nonsense a bou t 9/11, / the Iraq war and the finding and u se of chemical and b iological weapon s? Steve Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University o f Maryland, said the level of misinformation sugg ested that some Americans may b e a voiding h aving an experience of \"cognitive dissonance\". In short, their beliefs were in conflict with the facts and so it is their beliefs, not the facts, which d ictate their reactions and respon ses. Implanting b elief is everything to the Illuminati beca use it is through b elief that we manifest our reality. What we don't 'see', we make up The e yes have a blind spot where the optic nerve c onn ects to the e ye in the midd le of the retina. Whatever we may b e looking at we ca nno t see a nything from that part of the e ye, but the brain weaves the picture together fr om the information available a nd fills in the 'hole ~~ Reality is only what we are programm ed to believe it is. What we believe we are 'seeing' is what we see and it is the same with all five-senses. The phenomena of phantom limb syndrome when p eople have limbs removed bu t can still feel them is another example of the five-senses reacting to the brain's s ense of reality. In the first Matrix movie, the woman kno wn as the 'Oracle' tells the Neo character not to worry abou t the vase. What vase, he asks? As he speaks, a vase falls to the floor next to him. He is very apologetic, but the Oracle says: \"What's really go ing to cook you r noodle is would it have happened if I hadn't said anything?\" We a re being constantly p rogramm ed to accept realities that suit the a genda because once we do those realities can manifest. I wond er how many times people have warned children abou t something to such an ob sessive e xtent that the c hild's mind h as absorbed that reality and created it. \"I was always telling him he would h ave a n accident if he wasn't careful and now he has.\" The same process is used on the c ollective mind o f humanity by the Illuminati to manifest the reality they want us to h ave. When I asked Credo Mutwa why even more people did not see the Reptilian entities, he said it was because they are so at odd s with hu man reality that the mind removes them from what it 'sees'. The mystic, Sri Aurob indo Ghose, also said that most humans possess a \"mental screen\" that keeps us from seeing b ehind lithe veil of matter\". Daughter or no daughter In The Holographic Universe, Michael Talbot reca lls an experience he had that confirms what I am sugg esting h ere. He says that in the mid 1 970s his father hired a professional hypnotist to entertain a group of fr iends. One of those c hosen to b e hypno tised was a man called Tom and this was the first time he had met the hypno tist. What stage hypno tists do is to p rogramme a person to b elieve they are seeing something or doing something that is pure invention. We have a ll seen them m ake people believe they are seeing the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 205 audience naked o r they are a dog o r a mouse or whatever. Michael Talbot recoun ts how this hypno tist made Tom believe there was a giraffe in the room and eat a raw potato b elieving it to b e a n apple. All this is confirmation that the brain sees and experiences what it is programm ed to b elieve it sees and experiences. But the most profound p art of the story came when Tom was brough t back to 'waking' consciousness. Just before the hypno tist ended the formal trance state, he told Tom that when h e a woke he would no t be a ble to see his daugh ter, Laura. The hypno tist asked Laura to stand right in front of her father so that when he opened h is eyes he would b e looking at her stomach. Tom was asked if he c ould see his daugh ter. \"No\", he replied. Laura was even g iggling, but it made no difference. The hypno tist hid b ehind Laura a nd h eld something against the small of her back. To see it, Tom would h ave had to see through h is daughter. The hyp notist asked Tom what he was holding irtl1is hand and, leaning forward looking at the stomach o f his daugh ter, he said: II A watch. II He was asked if he c ould read the inscription and, squinting to read the small writing, he did so. The hyp notist revealed that he was indeed h olding a_ watch with that inscription. 3 Tom's mind h ad b een p rogramm ed to b elieve he c ould no t see his daugh ter and so h e didn't. More than that he c ould see what was behind h er. How is this possible? We construct our reality 'in h ere' not 'out there'. With this knowledge we a re at the c utting edge of und erstanding ho w the Illuminati, and through them, the Matrix, controls billions of people from (illusory) cradle to g rave. They p rogramm e us to b elieve a version of ourselves, life, possibility and the world, and this belief constructs our reality in line with that indoctrinated b lueprint. We only 'see' what we a re cond itioned to see a nd edit out anything that contradicts it. For instance, to advo cates of war the statement \"I want peace\" is s aying \"l want to let 'terrorists' and 'dictators' do what they like.\" Or to suppo rters of unfettered indu strialism the statement, “ We must protect the planet\", is s aying “ We should go b ack to living in tents and caves and working the land with horses and ploughs.\" Each side does not hear what’s being-said b eca use their minds edit the message to fit their beliefs. I have witnessed many exchanges like this and everything b ecomes polarised - just as the Illuminati want. Polarisation = division and conflict; and d ivision and conflict = divide a nd rule. They want conflicting, rigidly h eld b eliefs, for this reason. The Illuminati need the 'Left' as much as they n eed the 'Right' and 'Centre'; they n eed the 'poo r' as they n eed the 'rich'; they n eed the 'black' as they n eed the 'white' and they need the 'fors' as they need the 'againsts'. I have been writing all these years that the Illuminati don 't much care what you fiercely b elieve so long as you fiercely b elieve something b eca use they can then p lay you o ff against others who fiercely b elief the (apparent) oppo site. Holographic illusion The official 'truth' of mainstream 'science' is in disarray. Its ludicrously narrow vision of possibility - this 'world' is all there is - has been face d with so many basic questions it cannot begin to answer that it s credibility is in tatters among anyone with a mind still reporting for duty. The reason it i s silent in the face of such questions (like why they can't locate the mind in the brain) is because its foundation assumptions about consciousness and reality are nonsense. It is obsessed with the five- senses and cannot see beyond them. Given that we are dealing with infinity, five-sense 'science' must always be no-sense 'science'. It is, as Stanislav Grof puts it, \"a c onceptual straigh ~ acket\".4 The so-called 'paranormal' has always been dismissed as a fantasy simply b ecause such phenomena is unexplainable within its arrogant and juvenile view of possibility. Adding to its plight has been the brilliant work of those scientists researching the realms of quantum physics beyond the frequency range of the five-senses. From this research h as come the c onfirmation that what psychics, mystics, native peoples and freethinkers have been saying for thousands of years is correct. There a re infinite reals of existence and they are all part of one indivisible whole. The five- sense reality is only one of them. Most intriguing, g iven what I was told in those ayahuasca sessions, is the fast emerging evidence that what we think we see a s buildings, people, forests and lakes are ac tually three-dimensional holographic illusions conjured into that reality by our own minds. Albert Einstein said: \"We must remember that we do not observe na ture a s it actually exists, but nature e xposed to ou r methods of perception. The theories determine what we can o r cannot observe.\" 5 "},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" 206 Or, as he also said: \"Reality is an illusion, albeit a persistent one.\" Among those a t the forefront of this research are people like David Bohm, the world-renowned' quantum phy sicist at the University o f London, who worked with Einstein, and Karl Pribram, a neurophysiologist at Stanford University. Many o thers have picked up their themes and pu blished their own find ings. Bohm and Pribram came to b asically the same conclusions even though they arrived from different directions and did not correspond un til their original ideas were formed. This research states that our 'phy sical' reality is ~ made up o f holograms that give the illusion o f three-dimensional objects when they are, in fact, nothing more than frequency p atterns. The voice in the a yahuasca session said that our minds create these holographic illusions in a slightly different way to the holograms made by hu man technology, but the principle was the same. Holograms are made by d irecting a laser onto a pho tographic plate (Figure 44). Lasers are used b ecause they p rodu ce a stable, focussed b eam kno wn as 'coherent light' and p roject a single frequency. Coherent light is that which h olds a narrow, even beam over long distances and do es not expand like the light from a torch, for example. The laser is directed at the film through a semi-transparent mirror. Figu re 44 : Holog rams are made by using two parts of the same laser ligh t, O ne ha lf (referen ce be am) goes almost directly to the pho tographic plate and the o the r (working beam) is diverted onto the subject, When this working be am is diverted aga in on to the p rint it forms an \"interferen ce pa ttern\" with the referen ce beam. If a laser is s hone u pon this pa ttern it crea tes a 3-D holog raph ic picture o f the subject Figu re 45 : The wave or 'Interference' pa ttern on a h olog rap hic print, It seems random and mea ningless un til a laser ligh t is shone on the pa ttern and a hologram IS formed, Some of the light is deflected away in another direction and on to the object you want to film, Now you h ave the laser light pointing at the plate (kno wn as the reference beam) and the part deflected away on to the object (kno wn as the working b eam). This working b eam, carrying the vibrational image of the object in question, is then also directed on to the pho tographic plate. When it hits the plate it 'collides' with the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 207 reference beam - its 'other half' and this creates what is kno wn as an interference pattern b etween the two. You can liken the principle to throwing two stones in a pond and seeing ho w the two wave formations collide a nd interfere with eac h o ther. They form a wave pattern that is a wave representation o f the two stones, where they fell and at what speed. The interference pattern imprinted on the pho tographic plate looks much like the waves in the pon d, It is a series of lines that appear to b e rando m and incomprehensible (Figure 45), But when you shine the same type of laser light upon this pattern sudd enly an apparently three- dimensional image of the pho tographed o bject comes into view (Figures 46 and 47 ). Imm ediately when you turn o ff the light the holographic image disappears because it is only an illusion. A point to stress here is that the same type of laser light that creates the interference or wave pattern is also required to manifest the patterns as a three-dimensional holographic illusion. This is what we do with different parts of the mind interacting with eac h o ther. Like the laser, two p arts of the mind interact to form the wave (though t) patterns and the same mind ob serves them into h olographic illusion (Figu re 48). You might call this form of comm unication 'visual telepathy'. Remember, too, how the brain (a 'phy sical' computer for the mind) takes light/information from the e yes and turns a 2-D image on the retina into 3 -D image that we 'see'. It is turning 2 -D w ave patterns into 3 -D holographic illusions that we think is the world 'around ' us. In truth, it is all happening within us as we turn wave patterns into h olograms, as s ymbolised in (Figu re 49). Figu re 46 : A ho log raph ic 3-D picture crea ted by s hining a laser on to the wave pa ttern Figu re 47 : Holog rams c an look as 'solid' as we do , but you can pu t you r hand right through them be cau se the y are illusion s - just like we are! The 'television' brain"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 208 What the voice in Brazil told me was that our beliefs and sense of reality are projected as 'though t fields' that are akin to the interference patterns on a holographic film. Our thought waves create frequency p atterns in the unseen, 'non -phy sical' subconscious realms and by ob serving these patterns with ou r conscious minds We’ve turn them into apparently three-dimensional holographic forms. We both create the frequency patterns and, by ob serving those patterns, manifest the hologram - just as the laser does. Observed and observer are one, created and creator are one. As with the light shining on the holographic film, the '3-D' image only appears to exist when we are observing it ('shining' on it, you might say). When we a re not observing these vibrating thought fields, they are frequency p atterns and no t the a pparently three dimensional images we think we are seeing. It is the same principle a s a television set that turns electromagnetic frequencies broadcast from a transmitter into pictures we ca n recognise. Whenever you think you are seeing something 'real' you are actually watching ho lographic television and you r brain/lower mind is the TV set. I delude myself, therefore I am. When you see a holographic picture it seems to b e 3-D and o ccupy ing 'space ', but it is not. It is a virtual reality: an illusion. The image is not occupying 'space '; it is an interference pattern on a film. What we think we a re seeing with ou r 'eyes' as 3-D images occupy ing 'space' all around u s, are just a virtual reality. There a re no 3 -D images 'out there', only the frequency patterns that our mind and b rain d ecode into h olographic illusions 'in h ere'. I remember the really bo ring hymn they sang at my school called \"God b e in my Head\". Well, symbolically everything is in you r 'head' or, rather, mind. It is like looking out of the windo w, seeing a frequency p attern, and saying: \"Hey, there's Mrs Smith running for the bus.\" Quantum physics has long discovered that atoms, the so-called bu ilding blocks of the 'phy sical' world, are themselves made up o f smaller and smaller 'particles' like e lectrons.

And, get this: they o nly manifest as particles - 'phy sical' when we are looking at them!! Otherwise they are a lways in wave-form. Michael Talbot writes in The Holograph ic Universe: \"For [Karl] Pribram, this sy nthesis made h im realize that the objective world d oes not exist, at least not in the way we a re a ccustomed to believing. What is 'out there' is a vast ocean o f waves and frequencies and reality looks c oncrete to u s only because our brains are able to take this holograph ic blur and convert it into sticks and stone s and o ther familiar objects that make up o ur world ... \" ... In o ther words, the smoothness of a p iece of fine china a nd the feel of beach sand be neath ou r feet are really just elaborate versions of the phantom limb syndrome. \"According to Pribram this does not mean there a ren't china cups and g rains of beach sand ou t there. It simply mean s that a china cup ha s two very different aspects to its reality. When it is filtered through the lens of our brains it manifests as a cup. But if we could ge t rid o f our lenses, we'd e xperience it as an interference pa ttern. Which is real and which is illusion? 'Both are real to me,' says Pribram, 'or, if you want to say, neither of them is real'.\" 6 Appropriately, it was the discoveries by the Frenchman Jean B. J. Fourier in the 18th century that led to television, the discovery o f holograms and the research that revealed ho w the brain is actually a frequency decoder Fourier developed a process called Fourier transforms. This is a mathematical method o f conv erting p atterns into simple wave forms and b ack again, so p roviding the potential for a television camera to conv ert pictures into electromagnetic frequencies and the television to conv ert them back again. Picking up this theme, Dennis Gabor won the Nobel Peace Prize for his development of holographic techno logy, starting in the late 1940 s. He turned a three-dimensional ob ject into a wave/frequency p attern on pho tographic film and then conv erted it back to a 3-D holographic image in the way I have described. At the e nd o f the 1970 s, research by Russell and Karen DeValois, two n europhy siologists at Berkley University, revealed compelling evidence, since suppo rted by coun tless other scientists across the world, that the brain is decoding frequency p atterns and turning them into ho lographic images that we 'see'. The same Fourier system is invo lved. in the way the brain do es this. It was already kno wn that the brain cells in the visual cortex, from where we 'see', react to d ifferent frequency p atterns arid activate a ccording to the type of fr equencies they received. For a century it had b een kno wn that the ea r was a frequency d ecoder and experiments by Georg von Bekesy, another Nobel Prize winner, had long confirmed how the skin respond ed to frequencies. Other research strong ly sugg ests, as the voice in Brazil told me, that all the five- senses are the same. They are decoding frequencies into sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. As the Morpheus character said in the first Matrix movie: "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 210 \"What is real? How do you d efine real? If you a re talking a bout what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see then real is merely electrical signa ls interpreted b y y our brain.\" It goes even further than that. It depends on the point from which you want to ob serve the illusion. At one level, the brain is a hologram acting like a c omputer. interpreting reality. But at a higher point of observation, there is no b rain!! That's just another illusion. The wall i s 'solid'? Sorry, impossible There is no such thing as 'empty space' (unless you b elieve there is!). Physicists calculate that every cubic centimetre of 'empty space' (i.e. that which ou r 'phy sical' senses canno t' see') contains more e nergy than is contained in all the matter of the kno wn ('seen') universe! Some e mpty ~ \"\" space , eh? The a strophy sicist and author, Giuliana Conforto, notes that we c anno t 'see' 99.5% of the mass in the kno wn u niverse. Space only appears 'empty' because the e nergy is beyond the frequency range of the five-senses and it is in these unseen realms that the though t fields are c onstructed that we turn into ho lographic illusions of three dimensional 'solidity'. The realm of the five-senses is like the c rest of a wave, while the unseen realms are the infinite ocea n from which this reality is made manifest through thought. I have quo ted in almost every book the words of the brilliant, and much missed, American comedian, Bill Hicks. He was a man who experienced many times the kind o f 'trip' I experienced in Brazil. Bill said: \"Matter is merely energy cond ensed to a slow vibration; we a re a ll one c onsciousness experiencing itself subjectively; there's no such thing as death, life is just a dream, and we a re the imagination o f ourselves.\" Superb. But while the five-sense reality is dense compared with the rest of the ocean, it is not solid o r anything like. It just appears to b e. The phy sical realm is constructed, scientists s ay, with atoms. These a re named from the work o f an ancient Greek called Democritus, who made the first kno wn claim that matter was made up o f tiny p articles that he called atoms. This was s ome 2,500 y ears ago in ou r measurement of 'time' when the materialist view of the world was found ed. The science establishment did, however, dismiss this idea of atoms for many centuries and it was not revived un til 1808 . Today we kno w that atoms contain even smaller particles consisting o f a nucleus (made of protons and n eutrons) orbited by electrons. The inside of the a tom with the e lectrons orbiting the nucleus while spinning themselves is s imilar to the principle of planets orbiting the Sun, though not the same. The point I am m aking is this: the a toms that comprise 'solid', 'phy sical' matter are not solid o r phy sical at all. They are overwhelmingly 'empty' from a 'phy sical' sense perspective (Figure 50). As one writer put it if the a tom was the size of a ca thedral, the nucleus etc would be abou t the size of a ten cent piece , The rest is 'empty' to the perception o f the five-sense world and is not in the least 'solid'. So ho w can something that is not in any way solid b e the building block o f a solid reality? Of course, it can't. The illusion o f solidity is just that illusion. Amit Goswami writes in The Self Aware Universe “ You can't be sure if all things are made of atoms - it's an assumption, suppose a ll things, including atoms are made of consciousness instead ~ '\" Itzhak Bentov makes this point very well in his book, Stalking the wild Pendulum. He e xplains what would be seen with a microscope capable of observing sing le a toms and the subatomic realm: \"Let us now magnify a p iece o f bone ... we see the a toms wea ving back and forth like a field o f ripe wheat blown b y the wind. They move in un ison a nd in b eautiful rhythm. Acoustical energy is flowing through the crystal. \"Next we focus on the a toms. At first they appe ar as little shad owy balls vibrating a bout fixed po ints in the molecule. As we magnify. we see less and less. The e lectron shell has s omehow dissolved. and we a re looking a t a vacuum. As we further magnify we see something tiny moving ab out. We focus on what we suspect is the nu cleus of the a tom, located in this vast space within the a tom. If we take the d iameter of the nucleus of a h ydrogen a tom to be 1 mm . then the d iameter of the e lectron o rbit will about 10 meters. a ratio of 1 to 10.000. and the intervening space is vacuum. \"As we zero in a nd further magnify the vibrating nu cleus. it seems to be d issolving. We a re looking a t some shad owy pulsation; some more magnification and the nu cleus is almost gone. We a re sensing the pulsation of some en ergy: it seems to be a rapidly pulsating field. But where d id the bone go? We thought that we were looking a t a solid p iece o f matter! "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 211 \"Well. it seems that the real reality - the microreality, that which underlies all our solid, good. comm on-sense reality - is made up, as we h ave just witnessed, of a vast empty s pace filled with o scillating fields! Many different kinds of fields. all interacting with each o ther. The tiniest disturban ce in o ne field carries over into the o thers. It's an interlocked web of fields, each pulsating a t their own rate bu t in harmony with the o thers, their pulsations s preading out farther and farther throughout the cosmos.\" 9 Figu re 50 : The a toms tha t make up ou r 'solid' world a re virtually 'empty' to five-sen se reality. You cou ld ha rdly find an ything less. 'solid' than an a tom. So ho w can .the se be the building blocks of the 'solid' ph ysical world? The y c an't; it's all illusion Nothing adds to the belief in the 'phy sical body ' more than the a pparent solidity o f bone, but bone is not solid at all. Bentov go es on to say that a powerful enough disturbance by on e vibrating field can kno ck others from their harmonious rhythm and the irregularity spreads to d isturb the neighbouring fields. This is how the disharmonious vibrations caused by stress and trauma c an cause 'phy sical' disease dis-ease - by disrupting the vibrational harmony o f the body h ologram. When we are e motionally charged, upset or stressed we stop thinking straight for the same reason. The e motional field disrupts the mental. This also explains why those who work with electromagnetic techno logy, live near or und er power lines, or use mobile phones can suffer more than o thers from certain cancers etc. These techno logy fields disrupt the harmony o f the hologram and the thoug ht fields from which they manifest. Pollution, nuclear waste a nd radiation h ave the same e ffect of vibrationally imbalancing the body ho logram. But, as always, only if we think they do ! The Trinity? Itzhak Bentov p oints out in Stalking the Wild Pendu ilim that the interaction o f two frequencies produ ces a third frequency that is much slower than the other two. Is this the process by which h igher fr equencies of thou ght interact to p rodu ce this lower fr equency, the five-sense world? Is this the real origin o f the obsession with the symbol of the trinity through the a ges, like Christianity's Father, Son and Holy Ghost? Are these really codes for two v ibrations interacting to create a third, denser one - the 'son' of the other two? Maybe a nd ho w appropriate that one of the main characters in the Matrix movies is called Trinity. The Swedish mystic, Emanuel Swedenbo rg, said that our universe is created, and h eld together as a 'phy sical' reality, by two wave-like flows, one from what he called 'heaven' and the other fr om our own 'soul', as he put this. Dr George F. Dole, a professor of theology at the Swedenbo rg Schoo l of Religion in Massachusetts, wrote: \"If we pu t those images toge ther, the resemblance to the hologram is s triking. We-are constituted b y the intersection of two flows - one d irect, from the d ivine. and o ne indirect, from the d ivine via our environment."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 212 We can view ourselves as interference patterns because the inflow is a wave p henomenon , and we a re where the waves meet.\" 11 Reality is created from endless s ources of 'wave' or though t, but the principle is correct. Two forces interact to create a third. This is the trinity. Put another way, father and mother create a denser 'son'. But enough abou t George Bush. Life is but a dream Charles Tart, a professor of psychology at the Davis Campus of the University o f California, asked two skilled hypnotists called Anne a nd Bill to h ypno tise eac h o ther. He was trying to synchronise their two hyp notic realities and that is what happened. The two, both g raduate students, found themselves experiencing the same 'place', a beautiful beac h and o cean. They swam together, studied the same crystalline rocks, and 'talked' to each o ther even though they were not speaking in this reality, from where Tart was observing them. They later recalled that this hyp notic dream was every b it as 'real' as their experience in their 'awakened state' and included five-sense-type sensations although their hypnotic world was more pliable a nd less dense than this one. During their experience they o ften forgot to manifest bod ies for themselves and floated around o nly as faces and heads. On on e occasion when Bill asked Anne to take his hand she had to 'think' her own 'hand' into 'existence' That may sound amazing, but what they experienced was no d ifferent, except in d ensity, from the 'world' we think is 'real'. I experienced something very similar to this when I walked on a beac h in an altered state of consciousness. Interestingly, the nearest psychological state to the hypno tic state is the waking state! We are living in a dream just as much as we a re when we sleep and what we ca ll our memory is our ability to remember our dreams. The difference is whether we kno w it is a dream or believe it to b e real. If you d rive a c ar over a c liff in this five-sense dream world you are dead because that is the accepted reality o f this realm. Do the same in a dream you kno w is a dream and you will wake up unh armed. The interchange between the Neo character and the e nlightened little boy in the first Matrix movie e ncapsulates the nature of our reality: \"Do no t try to be nd the spoon; that is impossible, only try to realise the truth.\" \"What truth?\" \"There is no spoon ... it is not the spoon that bends, it is only y ourself.\" This is like the story o f the two monk s debating abou t the movement of a flag in the wind. \"The flag is moving\", said on e. \"No, the wind is moving\", said the other. A third, passing by and h earing the conv ersation, said: \"The flag is not mov ing. The wind is not moving. Your mind is moving.\" The nature of our 'phy sical' dream is dictated by ou r beliefs, which p roject thou ght fields that we observe into ho lographic illusion, We project the frequency p attern with the though ts of our non phy sical minds and ou r conscious minds decode them into the three-dimensional holographic illusions we take to be real. That's how we create our 'seeing' reality and that's how the illusion works. The Robin Williams movie, Wha t Dreams May Come (PolyGram, 1998), offers an excellent visual portrayal of what I am talking about here. It shows how, after 'death', we c reate our own reality with ou r thoughts and b eliefs. What needs to b e emphasised, however, is that we a re also do ing that in this five-sense realm. What is free will? Something to emphasise here. The conscious mind is not the one ultimately in control of events, except in the way it decodes though t patterns into h olographic 3-D in acc ordance with its s ense of reality. The subconscious is the main source of human respon se a nd b ehaviour, not the c onscious that thinks it is making the decisions. Experiments have revealed that the signals in the brain n ece ssary to move a limb, open the mouth o r take a ny 'phy sical' action, begin some one a nd a half second s before the c onscious mind makes the 'decision' to do it. Benjamin Libet and Bertram Feinstein, neurophysiologists at Moun t Zion Hospital in San Francisco, confirmed this theme in their experiments. They asked p eople to p ress a button when they were touched. The outcome was that the brain reacted to the touch in 0 .0001 o f a second and the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 213 button was pressed in 0 .1 o f a second . The a mazing p art, however, is that the person was not aware of feeling the touch o r pressing the button for a full half a second . Other tests have revealed that the reac tion to stimuli registers in the human energy field (the location o f mind) even b efore it does in the brain. The subconscious makes the decisions and, while the c onscious level can h ave a n inpu t here a nd there, it is basically the observer and experiencer. Psychiatrist Carl Jung coined the word \"synchronicity\" to d escribe the a mazing coincidences that happen to us, which are thou sands or milli ons of times beyond statistical chance. It is as if some 'force' was guiding such events. Well it is. In my view, synchronicity is the c onscious mind ob serving what the subconscious has decided will happen. \"Going with the flow\" is going with the will of the subconscious; fighting the flow is fighting the will of the subconscious. Do we really h ave free-will? Yes, but not nece ssarily at the conscious level of the five-senses, except, that is, for what we c hoo se to ob serve into h olographic illusion from the thou ght fields place d b efore us. The c onscious and subconscious were the two 'different' levels of me, of which I was so aware on that Wogan Sh ow interview in 1991 . My conscious level observer / experiencer was in turmoil while my subconscious was perfectly calm beca use it knew w here it was all leading. I went on the show in the first place , despite the c onsequences my conscious mind knew w ould ensue, beca use my subconscious was making the decisions. Physicist David Bohm says: \"Every action starts from an intention in the implicate [non-'physical'] order. The imagination is already the creation o f the form; it already has the intention and the germs of all the movements needed to carry it out. And it effects the bod y and so on , so that as c reation takes place in that way from the subtler levels of the implicate o rder, it goes through them until it manifests in the e xplicate\" [five-senses],13 This fits the information given to me by the voice in Brazil. It said the Matrix had b een created by the collective subconscious, and the c onscious mind h ad b een imprisoned by the illusions thus created. The Matrix took on a life of its own when it acce ssed an 'energy source' of its own - 'fear' generated by the conscious and subconscious mind that was caugh t in an illusion b elieving it to b e 'real', This 'self-aware fear', the Matrix, then also trapped the c ollective subconscious in illusion, As I have detailed at length in other book s, the Illuminati's s ecret langu age is that of symbolism and metapho r. Global society and the media a re awash with such h idden messages that are ca lled 'subliminal' or 'below threshold', They are the language of the subconscious and the Illuminati know that if they p rogramme the subconscious with a reality they want, the five-sense level will act it out. It is the subconscious that the Illuminati target most of all. Mass hypnosis We are further cond itioned to see what we a re told to see by the very 'norms' of society I have been emphasising in book after book . Hypno sis comes in endless forms. It does not have to stand on a stage or hold a swinging po cket watch. Hypno sis of the type I am talking abou t is the programming o f the c onscious and subconscious mind to b elieve a falsehood to such an extent that this is what it 'sees'. The hypno tist is implanting a false reality into y our mind. Those ten words encapsulate the real motive behind the 'education' system, official 'science', the media, gov ernment pronouncements, and all the other sources of official 'information' with which the human b rain and mind is deluged every d ay - \"the hypno tist is implanting a false reality into your mind \". I have e xpo sed this process in d etail in o ther books and this is what these institutions are: hypno tists. This is especially true of 'education' and the media, and, most particularly, television. These c onstant influences programm e our sense of 'reason' to such an extent that we believe the illusion to b e real. In on e of the book s of Carlos Castaneda, he quo tes his s haman source, Don Juan, as saying: \"We a re p erceivers. We a re a wareness; we are not objects; we h ave no solidity. We a re b oundless ... We. or rather our reason, forget [t his] and thus we en trap the totality of ourselves in a vicious c ircle from which we rarely emerge in our lifetime.\" 14 From the moment we become c onscious as a c hild, the programming o f our reality b egins. In fact it begins in the womb through the mother. We a lready start with a 'body ' that carries its inherited reality programming through the DN A and this usually includes genetic subservience to authority and a sense of \"I am small and insign ificant\". I see the body as like a bucking horse that our consciousness has to subdu e a nd"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 214 harmonise by expressing its reality ov er that inherited g enetically by the body o r 'horse'. I reckon the minds of vast numbers of people a re prisoners of their body 's genetic programming and respon ses. The 'horse' is in control of their actions and reactions, not the 'rider', the mind. In such p eople a n inherited g enetic trait li ke alcoholism will be repeated in their own experience. Those with consciousness more powerful than the genetic programming will be a ble to ov erride it and avoid the repetition. When I was walking in an altered state on the 'magic mushrooms', I came across a horsebox p arked in the street and along side was a horse a nd rider. The voice said to me that the a nalogy o f the horse a nd rider, body and consciousness, was valid. It said that the hologram, the 3-D illusion, has a fantastic capacity for storing information, a fact that science has confirmed. The voice said that 'space', like 'time', was an illusion. Something as 'small' as the DNA had the ca pacity to store a stonishing amounts of information in the form of vibrational codes beca use there is no 'space' in terms of 'big' and 'small'. There is only everywhere. A pin-head and the infinite a re ac tually the same. The voice said that the programm ing o f a body h ologram - its \"library o f experience\" - is passed on through the DN A to its s uccessors in the line. The body h olograms contain all the information acc umulated by all the e xpressions of that DN A since the line 'began'. These genetic 'lines' do no t exist as 'past' to 'future', but in different realities of the infinite NOW. Imagine, the voice said, that the incoming consciousness has to cope with all those inherited p rogramm es, beliefs and assumptions of reality. The voice said: \"Do you wonder any longer why p eople a re so easy to manipulate when they inherit that genetic programming to start with?\" It said that most people e xpended so much energy coping with the inherited respon ses, reactions, desires and d emands of their body h ologram that they h ad little left to look up and see beyond the illusion. With g reat synchronicity as I later walked b ack along the same street, the horse was being led into the horsebox . \"You are look ing at a profound symbol of the human cond ition\", said the voice. \"Human consciousness is trapped in the 'horse' and the 'horse' is trapped in the 'box ' human consciousness is trapped in the 'body ' and the 'body ' is trapped in the Time Loop and the Matrix.\" How w e c an b reak free will be discussed later. This inherited p rogramm ing through the body ho logram and the e ffect of mind on 'body', explains why many p eople who h ave been regressed to 'past lives' have realised that the e xperiences of a previous 'incarnation' are symbolised by traits in their body . Someone who h ad h is throat cut might have a n unexplainable scar-like line on the throat or a person who h ad h is hand smashed by torture might have a deformed h and in this 'life'. These a re mind and bo dy memories manifesting in the hologram. It is important to remember this body p rogramming when you are in altered states of consciousness because you r mind and body might not be on the same page of perceived reality. Your mind may jump o ut of the windo w shou ting \"1 can fly\", but half way do wn you r body says: \"Not with me you bloody can't.\" Aaaaahhhhhhhh ! Inter-generational hypnosis In childhood we are subjected to the programming o f our parents who instil their own conditioned reality upon u s. From the a ge of {our or five this is compound ed massively by school and 'education', which is little more than legalised child abuse. The a buse, that is, of the c hild's mind and sense of reality. What does the 'education' system actually do? It indoctrinates a false reality d ay after day throughou t the most critical period o f a c hild's development by (a) poun ding ou t the official version o f science, history, possibilit y and impossibility, and all the rest; and (b) by insisting that only by repeating b ack this bollocks in exams will you p rogress within the Illuminati system that controls 'education'. For many this indo ctrination at schoo l is followed by college or university 'education' in which the same process is repeated at a higher level. Education is not involved in d evelop ing self-awareness, it merely p repares young p eople to do the jobs that will serve the system. Real 'education' is actually un learning the indoctrination o f official 'education'. Constantly und erpinn ing these false realities through out our lives is the c ondition ing o f the same 'norms' and 'truths' by the media, most powerfully via the resident hyp notist in the c orner of the room. \"Mom, where do I learn abou t the meaning o f life?\" - \"Oh shut up and watch TV.\" - \"OK , mom, Zzzzzzzzzzzz.\" Add to all this the fact that almost everyon e a round you will have been through the same programming and accept the same realities, plus there is the peer pressure throughou t your life to conform to the norms even if you d on't want to. This produ ces a network o f inter-conn ected imposition o f reality that causes all but a few to submit to this collective mind-control. When they accept this hyp notic state, and most do from a very early age, their brains and minds are programm ed to 'see' the reality it has been p rogramm ed to b elieve in. It 'sees' what it is indoctrinated to see, and edits away anything that doesn't fit. This confirms to p eople most"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 215 powerfully o f all that what they b elieve is true! What a web. This mind manipulation is well summ ed up by this observation: \"If a baby from birth is told by loving p arents that 2 + 2 = 3; and later at Sund ay schoo l, kindergarten, preparatory schoo l, public school. and u niversity this you ng mind is again told by apparently clever and often h ighly respected teachers that 2 + 2 = 3; and if this s ame teaching comes through the mass media, backed by the weight of law, is it any wond er that many p eople. often in v ery respon sible positions, seriously b elieve that 2 + 2 = 3?\" 15 The bigger the lie a nd the more it is repeated, the more will believe it. This process of indo ctrinated reality has conv inced six billi on p eop le that 'seeing is believing' and that the 'world' around them is 'real'. It must be, they can see, hear, touch, smell and taste it. That means it has to b e real. Oh y eah? Who says? Consensus reality The vibrational fields we 'decode' into 'phy sical' holographic reality are not only ou r own. They also include the though t projections of the Matrix, including its Illuminati 'agents' and 'Reptilians', and the thou ghts of those who influence our beliefs. The voice in the Amazon told me that the basic landscape of our five-sense universe like the planets and star systems, are the c reations of the Matrix entity. These a re though t fields - vibrational fields - that our minds decode into h olographic '3-D' illusions of phy sicality. There a re many planets and stars 'out there' that we do no t currently see because we are not tuned into their fr equency range and as our 'radio dials' becomes more open and sensitive we will 'see' more of them. \"We have discovered a new planet\", the headlines will say, but we have tuned into a new planet would b e more acc urate. Within this basic Matrix landscape is the c ollective human mind, what I call consensus reality. This adds its reality to the Matrix landscape a nd so life on this planet will be different to life on another, although bo th will exist within the rules of the Matrix. The holographic 'human' body adds its programming to this mix and ou r 'individual' subconscious and conscious minds also tinker with the c ollective song . We might be sing ing from the same basic song sheet manifested through the c ollective mind, but we can change the lyrics around and interpret them differently. Put another way, we may agree on the background to the painting, but we differ on the detail we wish to include. This is where the 'individual' mind can pu t its own spin on consensus reality. We may bo th agree we a re looking at a movie or a ca r, but we will interpret what we see differently - \"nice ca r\", \"awful movie\". In this and more profound ways we are c hanging the detail of the c ollective reality to reflect our uniqueness of view. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung called the c ollective mind the Collective Unconscious, the 'species mind' if you like. I will call this 'consensus reality' (what we are a ll agreed exists). You might symbo lise the 'individual' mind as a personal computer and the c ollective mind as the Internet or World-Wide Web through which all computers can conn ect and comm unicate. The so-called 'hundredth monkey synd rome' is an expression o f the c ollective unconscious, or the c onsensus reality, at work. This is the discovery that when a few members of a species are taugh t something n ew sudd enly all or many o f the species begin to do the same instinctively withou t being shown. It is s uppo sed to b e a mystery, but it isn't. The monk eys or whatever species implant the new kno wledge in the c ollective mind by the very act of learning and realisation. It is like finding n ew information and po sting it on the Web. It becomes available to anyon e conn ected to the Web. When enough monkeys have a dded the new kno wledge to the c ollective mind (and it doesn't take many) it is powerful enough to b e ac cessed by the other 'computers' and they can sudd enly do instinctively what the pioneers had to learn. Unlike humans, animals don 't und ergo a lifetime of conditioning. This makes them m ore sensitive to their multi-levels of being and they can access the collective mind with g reater clarity. But humans do it, too. Every time you think, you are putting that thou ght, belief, knowledge or opinion, into the c ollective mind. If the Illuminati can p rogramm e a sense of reality into billi ons of people they kno w that this will also consequently d ominate the reality o f the collective mind. It becomes a c ycle of 'individual' minds placing their beliefs into the c ollective mind and, in turn, being influenced o r confirmed in their beliefs by the reality o f the c ollective mind. Once a gain we need to b reak the circle. The c ollective mind manifests the c ollective c onsensus reality, the dominant belief in what is 'real'. The c ollective mind is dominated by the belief that the walls around y ou are 'solid' beca use that is what it has been p rogramm ed to b elieve. Even thou gh you may b e a ware that it's not possible for the walls to b e solid, as explained earlier, the c ollective reality to which y ou are c onn ected will go on"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 216 manifesting the illusion that it is. \"I kno w this wall can't be solid, but I still hurt my h and when I smack it.\" When mystics meditate before performing a 'miracle' they are disconn ecting themselves from consensus reality, the c ollective mind, which says the 'miracle' is impossible. The basic landscape of the five-sense world, and all that we a gree is 'real', is generated by the Matrix entity and the though t fields of the c ollective human mind that our conscious minds decodes into a holographic 'world'. To b e truly free to create our own reality and end ou r belief in limitation, we need to d isconn ect our sense of reality from the Matrix and the c ollective c onsensus or, at least, give ourselves the option o f when, and when no t, to tap in. It suits me a t this moment to acce pt the illusion that I am sitting on a solid chair, but there are e ndless other collective realities I do no t wish to acce pt and I want to access the power to make that choice. It is within the c ollective unconscious that much o f the Matrix control will be removed and that is now happening, as I will come to later. I have been writing and talking for years abou t the way we c reate our own reality and live in ou r own personal 'universe' and this is how it is don e. We a re what we think we a re, and what we a llow others to tell us what to think we a re. The two are in fact the same. Physicist David Bohm is one of those who is convinced that reality o nly exists beca use of our though ts, and look at the implications of this in the a bility of the Illuminati/Matrix to feed u s false realities that suit the a genda. We are a lso unk nowingly observing though t fields created to mislead u s and we a re turning them into holographic images we believe to b e 'phy sically' real. \"It must be true, mate, I saw it with my o wn eyes.\" The higher levels of the hierarchy und erstand this process and u se it mercilessly to maintain, through hyp notising human minds, the reality that suits them. The M atrix = consensus reality The Illuminati/Matrix seek to construct a 'consensus reality' in which the c ollective human mind, Jung's collective unconscious, acce pts the prevailing 'truth' it is programm ed to b elieve. The more this happens, the more powerful are the though t patterns holding the manipulated reality together and the denser the holograms will appear. This is the 'freeze vibration' the psychic c omm unications talked abou t in the ea rly 1990 s. It is a form of collective hypnosis, a 'solidified' dream (or nightmare). Remember how the graduate students, Bill and Anne, shared p recisely the same hypno tic reality b eca use they hypno tised eac h other? Their consciousness conn ected to the point where they manifested the same illusion. This is what the consensus reality is. We a re mutually hypnotising eac h o ther through the ac ceptance a nd imposition o f 'norms' to share the same basic illusion. Look around the world and ob serve how diversity is being stamped out by the day and ho w w e c oncede our uniqueness to the global consensus reality we ca ll materialism. You find the same fast food chains, banks, architecture, econo mic a nd po litical systems, and lifestyles wherever you look. The a ssault on diversity is designed to crystallize a nd solidify still further the c onsensus reality and make it even more difficult for people to see beyond it or to recognise that it's only a manipu lated illusion d esigned to imprison them. The a genda is to 'solidify' the c onsensus illusion still further by removing all challenges and alternatives to it. The Matrix reality is constructed from largely imbalanced, deluded thought (fear) that produ ce low vibrational frequency p atterns. Those ca ugh t in the Matrix illusion resonate to these patterns and the more caugh t you are, the slower you r vibration, as the work o f Valerie Hunt with the human energy field h as shown. People a re both caugh t in the vibrational web p rojected by consensus reality and add to the 'stickiness' of the web by contributing their like-vibration to this construct of fear and d isharmony . It is the ultimate vicious circle with p rison and p risoners both contributing to the survival of the Matrix. Until these frequency p atterns are c hallenged by those of Oneness and h armony , the Matrix will prevail beca use fear and d isharmony are the Matrix. That transformation is now und erway. Itzhak Bentov d iscusses the background to such ph enomena in Stalking the Wild Pendulum. He points out that when you pu t two violins together and p luck a string on on e of them, the same string on the other violin b egins to vibrate in what is called sympathetic resonance. Bentov also p resents this example: \"Supp ose we get several old-fashion ed p endu lum-typ e grand father clocks. Let us hang them on a wall and arrang e the pendu lums s o that they will start beating eac h o ther at a different ang le, that is ou t of ph ase with eac h o ther. If we disturb on e of the c locks it "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 217 will get locked [back] into rhy thm qu ite fast. The larger the number of oscillators within such a system, the more stable the system, and the more difficult to d isturb. It will force a wayward o scillator back into line very qu ickly.\"6 See what is happening in the Matrix and ho w it remains s o stable? As the mystic Sri Aurobindo Chose said, phy sical reality is just a mass of stable light. The more stable it is, the denser it appears as its vibrational state slows. This world, it seems, is in a state of extremely stable instability! Humans and everything else within the Matrix are oscillators, symbo lic tuning forks or violin strings beating ou t a frequency that represents their state of being, their reality. When we a ccept the Matrix/Time Loop v ersion o f reality we resonate to its frequency and b ecome one of its vibrational representatives like one of those grandfather clock p endulums in Bentov's example. As he said, the more pendulums or whatever which v ibrate oscillate - to the same pattern the more stable a nd d ifficult to change that pattern b ecomes. That is why the Matrix is a stable vibrational construct held together by the minds that resonate with it by b elieving its illusions to b e real. When we have a though t we a re sending ou t waves of sound at frequencies the five-senses canno t hear (infrasound it is called) and this s ound resonates a frequency p attern. In my v ideo The Freedom Road (Bridge of Love), I show how particles of sand and o ther material on metal plates react to sound frequencies. As the note is played, the particles imm ediately arrange themselves into distinct patterns as they v ibrate to the sound and make a visual image of it. They will stay there in this 'standing wave', as it is called, for as long as the sound continues. When the sound changes - i.e. the frequency pattern - the particles rearrange themselves in an instant into a new pattern that reflects the new frequency. The e ntire five-sense world is, like the body h ologram, a mass of vibrating reality fields held together by sound . Change the sound - the though t, the reality - and the world must change. It would appear that these though t fields take the form of a vortex, a spiral of energy like a whirlpoo l in a river. As I've said, vortices can b e incredibly stable a nd they can continue indefinitely un til the c ircumstances change sufficiently to stop o r redirect the flow through the spiral. The Matrix is a vortex spinning round and round, getting slower and slower, and causing the e nergy to b ecome denser and d enser as the illusion o f phy sicality h as taken an ever more powerful grip on human reality. Vibrated into line This is a view suppo rted by the American p sychiatrist David Shainberg o f the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry in New Y ork. He believes that though ts are vortices that can b ecome fixed and rigid. He sugg ests that these e xpress themselves as fixed o pinions, unchang ing views and a rigid sense of reality that is resistant to change. l7 I am sure he is right. The Matrix itself is a vortex and the Time Loop is the densest level of its s piral. The Time Loop is like a n anchor pulling the rest of the Matrix into g reater density and d isconnection. On this planet alone the best part of six billion p eople resonate to the illusions of the Matrix and that is why the Matrix can continue. Now, what happens when anyon e c hallenges the system and o ffers another reality? They are ridiculed, cond emned, fired, marginalised, attacked financially, jailed or even k illed. We can ob serve the 'phy sical' level of this, the holograph ic projection o f it, as we see the consequences that such people face. But what is really h appening on a vibrational level? It is the five-sense expression o f the Matrix energy p attern \"forcing a wayward o scillator back into line\". We may see the consequences in such rebels being attacked in v arious ways, but to the Matrix they represent a different frequency b eat that needs to b e kicked b ack into vibrational line by the prevailing - Matrix - frequency pattern. We a lso see politicians who start out challeng ing the system and later become a dvo cates of it. Blair cabinet ministers like David Blunkett and Peter Hain, and former Labou r Party leader, Neil Kinno ck, come immediately to mind. They were 'system busters' who joined the system. We ca nno t bring the Matrix p rison to a c onclusion by reac ting 'out there' with gun s, bombs, anger and h atred b ecause that will make the Matrix frequency even strong er by adding to its patterns of disharmony . The a nswer lies 'in h ere' as we change our own frequency p atterns and conn ect with Oneness, harmony and love. If we c hange ourselves, we c hange our 'world', our reality. Only then will the Matrix p attern b e overwhelmed by a mass vibrational change that will undermine the stability o f the frequency fields that hold its imprisoned minds in such servitude to the 'material' illusion. The Matrix is a vibrational construct and that's why it can b e broken do wn into mathematics, numerology and o ther fr equency measurement. To remove the c ontrol of the Matrix reality we have to b reak the vibrational power it has over us. In fact, most of that 'power' is s imply ou r ignorance that such control exists."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 218 Underpinn ing the belief in materialist 'solid' reality h as been the pre-eminence of official (Illuminati) science a nd its demand that everything b e 'proved' through experiments that can b e repeated. Scientists who sugg est conflicting explanations are ostracised o r und ermined to d efend the prevailing (Illuminati-imposed) 'wisdom'. Fund amental to losing sight of our infinite unity is the official policy o f mainstream science to depict the world as unconn ected p arts and this is reflected in the very structure of science with its compartmentalised 'specialities' that rarely, if ever, talk to eac h o ther. But when the beliefs of scientists are affecting the outcome of their experiments, as quantum physics have shown, what the hell use is s uch dog ma? A subatomic particle ca lled an anomalon h as been revealed to h ave different properties in different laboratories, which, as author Michael Talbot points out, is like having a ca r that changes its colour and features depending on who is driving. The 'laws' of 'science' only apply b eca use the scientists believe they do and, thanks to the god-like status of 'science', what it decides is 'real' becomes the c onsensus reality. But it's all illusion. Take a basic 'law' of science kno wn as cause a nd effect, the found ation o f the so-called Law of Karma. For every action there has to b e a re-action. That's true - but only if you b elieve it is. If you believe it's not true then it isn't! People have 'karma' only b eca use they b elieve they do at the level of their 'individual' and collective mind. The Danish phy sicist Niels Bohrone of the great pioneers of quantum phy sics, made the point that if subatomic particles only exist when they are observed ho w w as it possible to say what their characteristics are before they are observed? But that is what mainstream 'science' continues to do - investigate a nd label an illusion. If everything we 'see' is a hologram m anifested by ou r conscious minds from a thou ght field, how can 'science' be any more 'real' than anything else? William Tiller, a phy sicist at Stanford University said: \" ... When we get to the frontiers of our und erstanding, we can in fact shift the laws s o that we're c reating the phy sics as we go along .\" 1'1 would say that is how it has always been. As the voice told me in Brazil, there a re no 'laws', only infinite possibility. What is reality? What do you think it is? Then that is what it is. These areas of kno wledge a re far more 'subv ersive' to the system than simply expo sing the secret society n etwork o r the global agenda beca use they o ffer the means through which we can think the a genda a nd its fascist values out of our existence a nd think a new reality into b eing. This is the transition from the prison to the paradise I have long articulated. Like a ll reality, the transition has to h appen first in the mind - or more accurately the heart - and on ly then can we e xperience it in the 'phy sical' world as manifested ho lograms. Rejecting the c onsensus reality and creating ou r own is the transformation. It's like the story o f the e mperor's new clothes. The c onsensus reality was that he was wearing lovely n ew clothes because the crowd d id no t want to admit that he was naked. It took a small child to b reak the spell and say the obv ious: \"He's got no clothes on.\" 'Miracles' are a different sense of reality The 'laws' of the five-sense world may o nly b e what we think they are, but while we a ccept them as real we are subject to their limitations. In the same way, if we can free our minds of these realities, we a re no longer subject to their 'laws' and limitations. This is what we ca ll 'miracles'. Almost everyon e will have read o f 'unexplainable' feats like walking through fire withou t getting bu rned, having swords pushed through the body without injury o r scar, levitation and all the rest. None of these phenomena a re possible to conv entional materialist science, but that is s imply b eca use c onv entional science is the kno wledge equivalent of a Mickey Mouse movie. A w oman I knew allowed a room in h er house to b e used by serious meditators, those who wanted to meditate for a long time und isturbed. One guy went in and did no t appear for many d ays and she became c oncerned that he was OK . She took h im a c up o f tea a nd slowly op ened the doo r. The next moment the c up h ad crashed on the ground b eca use when she look ed at him the bottom half of his body was 'invisible'. Not possible? Oh y es it is and p erfectly explainable, too, as we'll come to shortly. In 190 5, the psychic, Indridi Indridason, was part of a project by leading scientists in Iceland into the 'paranormal'. When h e went into d eep trance the scientists s aw different parts of his body disappear and reappear. i9 Anything is possible, literally anything, beca use we a re infinite possibility. A w oman I met in Texas told me how she woke up n ext to h er husband on e morning to find him floating six feet abov e the bed still asleep. Apparently, he was a bit of a fly-by-night. Dr William Tufts Brigham, the c urator of the Bishop Museum in Hono lulu, was a keen investigator of the 'paranormal' and h is s tudies included the 'miracles' performed by the Hawaiian shaman, or kahuna. He witnessed on e of them heal a man who h ad b roken h is leg so b adly that piece s of bon e were protruding through the skin.

Brigham also watched a group o f kahun a walk b arefoot across volcanic rock so ho t it had h ardly cooled enough to take their weight. They went through a ritual of 'prayers' and walked across the rocks with no discomfort, let alone severe bums. Brigham was taken through the process and tried h imself, although h e refused to remove his boo ts! When he reached the other side, his boo ts and socks were on fire, but his feet were fine. \"1 h ad a sensation o f intense heat on my face and body , but almost no sensation in my feet\", he said. cl Some 'miracle men' have allowed themselves to b e studied by sceptic scientists and on e was the Dutch author, Jack Schwarz, in the 1970 s. Watched by do ctors and researchers from the University o f California's Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute a nd o ther institutions, he would push six-inch n eedles into his body with no p ain o r bleeding; hold hot coals; and p ress lighted cigarettes against his s kin with no ill effects. In the 1940 s, another Dutchman, Mirin Dajo, performed a stage show in which h e pushed a- fencing foil into his body and ou t the other side. Again, there was no b leeding, no p ain, and o nly a faint red line where the sword entered and exited. He agreed to do this before a host of doctors and journalists at a Zurich ho spital and was X-rayed with the sword inside to p rove that it was no trick. Later he a llowed scientists and do ctors in Basel to impale him. The outcome was the same.'= When King Lou is XIV of France sough t to pu rge the Hugu enots in the 1600 s, his death squads found a group known as the Camisards in the Cevennes Valley who simply would no t die und er any circumstances. Michael Talbot writes: \"In an official report sent to Rome, one of the persecutors, a p rior named Abbe du Chayla, complained that no matter what he d id, he could not succeed in h arming the Camisards. When he ordered them shot, t he musket balls would be found flattened between their clothing a nd their skin. When he closed their hands upon b urning coals, they were not harmed, and when he wrapped them head to toe in cotton soaked with oil and set them on fire, they did not burn.\" 23 Illusions cannot 'die' un less we believe they a re 'real' What goes on h ere? How is all this possible a s it demonstrably is? Quite simply such p eople disconnect their minds from the c onsensus reality and cease to b e subject to the illusory 'rules' of that reality. They manifest a different il lusion, a different dream. How many times do we have dreams in which we experience e vents that shou ld kill us or harm us, but don 't? It is the same principle. If it is you r reality that fire ca nno t burn you r feet then it canno t. Why? Because you r feet don 't exist any more than the fire does!! Hmm ' can an illusion b um an illusion u nless we believe it can and manifest that reality - the illusion o f burning and p ain? When We feel pain it is in the brain and no t in the big toe we have just bashed on the table. The brain manifests the pain from m essages it receives and the c ond itioned b rain feels pain on ly beca use it thinks it should. That is what its computer programm e says and that is what it delivers. When you change the programm e you g et a different reality - no bu rning and no p ain. 'Miracles' are only the withdrawing from consensus reality to where its illusory 'rules' no longer apply. How can you r body b um when you kno w it is only a holographic illusion o f your mind? How can a holographic illusion b e harmed by a sword that is also a holographic illusion? Answer: only when you b elieve it can! The guy who 'lost' half his body meditating in the room went into such another state of consciousness - reality - that his holographic body b egan to follow. In d oing so, it began to disappear, or withdraw, from this one. As for levitation and o ther such 'paranormal' phenomena (paranormal to the c onsensus reality), the principle is the same. The voice in Brazil told me: \"When you levitate, it is not 'you ' that goes 'up', it is your 'world' that goes 'down'.\" Put another way, our minds don 't lift us off the 'ground ' they rearrange our reality by changing the 'world' we believe is around u s. There is no b ed, as there is no spoo n, so ho w can you levitate abov e a bed that is not really there with a body that is not really there? \"It is not the spoon that bends, it is only y ourself.\" But an ob server can lock into the rearranged reality - the tl10ugh t pattern - of the 'levitator' and sl1are the same illusion that he is s ix feet abov e the bed. Oh, I hear, but isn't t he situation the a rt of overcoming g ravity? Only if you think it is beca use gravity is another illusion. If we did no t believe in it we would no t be subject to its rules. There a re no rules unless we believe there a re. Infinite love is the only truth, everything else is illusion. Most of us will have heard accoun ts of people who p rodu ce 'super-human' feats at moments of great challenge a nd emotional stress. Some have lifted cars to free their child. Their mind in that concentrated, highly emotional state, switches realities and they are no longer subject to the 'rules' of this one.

Once a gain she had changed realities in h er stress and focus of mind and could no t be effected by the laws of the reality that was effecting everyon e e lse. How many times do we hear it said that someone surviving an o rdeal that should h ave killed them has had a 'miraculous escape'? They changed realities at the c rucial moment, that's all, no miracles necessary. There is a point I'd like to stress here that I feel people get confused abou t. They equate performing these apparent 'miracles' with spiritual enlightenment and advancement and this can b e a real trap. You are not some 'living god on Earth' because you can do the party tricks that come from kno wing ho w w e c reate reality.

What makes this possible is that the particles are both each o ther and all the 'space' in b etween. They actually don 't have to comm unicate beca use they are the same. Is there a ny n eed for the following conversation b etween two 'particles' that are both the same David Icke? \"Hello, David Icke here, is that David lcke?\" \"Yeah, this is David Icke, nice to talk to y ou, David lcke.\" \"I have a message for you , David, can we manifest as a tea c up, please, someone just looked at me?\" \"I'm already on it David, bone c hina, right?\" \"Thanks David.\" \"That's OK , David.\" . Such a c onv ersation is unn ece ssary and so is comm unication b etween subatomic particles. The hologram is a perfect example of this theme. One of the a mazing traits of the hologram is that every part contains the whole (see Figure 51, look go od, don 't I?). If you cut a holographic film into four piece s and shine the laser on to each o f them, they will not reveal four parts of the picture. Each will show a smaller "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 221 Figu re 51 : Fine figure o f a ho logram. Every pa rt of a ho logram con tains a picture o f the who le and this is why every c ell in the bod y c ontains the inform ation to grow ano ther who le.

Cut the print into as many p iece s as you want and they will always project the same whole image when the laser is s hon e on them. It is beca use the human body is a hologram that every cell contains all the information n ece ssary to 'grow' a whole body ; hence they can clone people a nd animals from a single ce ll. Conv entional 'medicine' sitting in its establishment bunker dismisses alternatives like reflexology and cranial therapy as ridiculous quackery with no b asis in 'science'. If they were not so mesmerised by their Mickey Mouse medicine that serves the Illuminati pharmace utical cartel so wond erfully well, they would realise that the body is a hologram and the basis of such alternatives could no t be simpler. Reflexology is an ancient form of healing that is based on the und erstanding that different parts of the bod y, like the feet, hands and ears are mirrors of the whole body (see the foot and ear chart ~ in"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 222 Figures 52 and 53 ). The a rt goes back at least to the ancient Indian, Egyp tian and Chinese people, but yet again ou r beloved medical establishment decide they kno w best, why? they actually know next to no thing. Reflexology identifies points on the fee( hands, ear, etc., that relate to o rgans of the body and through these points any imbalances in the organs can be treated. This is not on ly p erfectly logical when y ou realise that the body is a hologram, it is how it must be beca use e very p art of a hologram contains the image of the whole. Every cell contains the whole, for goodness sake, as even the medical establishment has had to recogn ise. The a ncient art of acupun cture is based on the holographic sub-systems of the bod y, as is palm reading b eca use the hand contains the whole body. More than that, every p art of every hand, foot and ear also contains the whole a nd so do es every p art of every finger and every p art of every p art of the finger. The body ho logram is an expression o f the hologram that is the universe a nd the c osmos, and so is every p art of the body do wn to every cell, atom and electron. Holographic memory So to the brain, the c omputer-like interface between the mind and the holographic 'body ' of the five-senses. The brain is not the mind, it is a c omputer used by the mind and thus s cientists have never located where in the brain lies the mind. They n ever will beca use it's not there. We don 't think from the brain, but through the brain at the five-sense level of reality. Mainstream science has also b een un able to locate the a rea of the brain that contains the memory b eca use the memory (the c omputer hard d rive) exists throughout the brain. Of course it does, the brain is a hologram and every p art contains the ·whole. Horrible e xperiments on animals have removed massive parts of their brains and still found they could remember the tasks they were set when the whole brain was intact. People who h ave large parts of their brains removed b eca use of tumours do no t lose specific memories. They might not remember in g eneral quite so well beca use they have moved to a smaller level of the holographic memory where there is less clarity than in the whole. But they don 't lose one memory completely and retain another in crystal clarity c1S they would if memory was located in one a rea. The hologram has a staggering capacity to store information. You can store many p ictures on the same piece of holographic film, for instance, and by changing the a ngle a t which you direct the laser you can choo se which on e you want to see. Accessing ou r memory works in b asically the same way. We move our 'laser' to find the information we a re looking for in the hologram and those who can do this high ly efficiently are said to h ave a 'pho tographic memory'. Yes, a holographic pho tographic memory. People ca n 'read' objects like watches or jewellery and g lean from them detailed information abou t their history and owners because the objects are holograms and they h ave recorded that information. Our body ho lograms store memory from all of the senses. When, for instance, we smell something it can trigger a memory just as powerfully as when we see or hear something that recalls an experience. Our memory extends beyond even the brain h ologram and is located throug hout the body h ologram, too. In turn, the body h ologram contains the memory o f the c osmic hologram and so on . Everything is conn ected to everything else. Everything iv everything else. The Matrix canno t literally divide the whole into p arts beca use Oneness is always Oneness, but it can g ive the illusion o f division and p olarity, and this is what it does by manipulating ou r sense of reality. Division and po larity are il1usions beca use all is One. Holographic senses All our five-senses are holographic a nd are located through out the hologram-body . Yes, even ou r sight. It is clear that we don 't need eyes to see when you sift through the e ndless accoun ts of those who h ave experienced the out-of-body o r near-death ph enomena. They leave their bod ies and their 'eyes', but they can still see. This is possible beca use the mind do es not 'see', it decodes frequency p atterns into h olographic illusions it t hinks it sees. It is a virtual reality and y ou don 't need eyes to see what you r mind is think ing beca use it is all happening 'in h ere', not 'out there'. If something can d ecode frequencies into h olograms it can 'see'. As all consciousness can do this, everything can 'see' and every p art of the body ho logram has 'eyes'. Excuse me while 1 look through my big toe a t the inside of my sock. Anyon e got a needle? No really, we ca n see through out the body and that must be the c ase if the body is a hologram. More horrible experiments (I don 't want to kno w that badly, thanks) have shown that rats can continue to see perfectly well with 90 p er cent of their visual cortex in the brain removed, while ca ts continue to see a fter 98 p er cent of their optic nerves have c eased to function. There have been many experiments to show how some people"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 223 can see and read through their hands while their eyes were c overed with a blindfold. The hands and all other parts of the body can send v isual messages to the visual cortex in the brain from where we 'see'. But in fact, we don 't even need the brain to 'see' - that's just another level of the multi-levelled illusion. Does the infinite need eyes or a brain to see?? Paul Bach-y-Rita, a neuroscientist and phy sician at Wisconsin-Madison University, says: \"You don 't see with the e yes. You see with the brain.\" (Beyond that we see with the mind). When an image reaches the eye's retina, he says, it \"becomes nerve pulses no d ifferent from those from the big toe\". Information enters the e yes as a frequency p attern and the brain turns it into a 3-D image. Now, because e very p art of a hologram contains the whole, every p art of the body - the hand, toe, knee - has the a bility to p ass frequency patterns to the brain, which it transforms into h olograms that we ca n 'see'. This means that people really do have e yes in their backsides. I have heard some people speak o f being able to see 360 d egrees when they have e ntered altered states of consciousness that make them m ore a ttuned to these senses by withdrawing their focus from the five-sense c onsensus reality. All this is perfectly explainable from the holographic perspective. Life magazine featured a Russian woman called Rosa Kuleshov a who could read with h er fingertips and o thers have been able to do the same with o ther parts of their bod ies like the nose a nd ear. 2 \" David Eisenberg MD, a c linical research fellow at the Harvard Medical School, highlighted two yo ung Chinese sisters who could read with their armpits! 20 There was also the 'miraculous' discovery by Paul Bach-y-Rita a nd o ther researchers at the University o f Wisconsin-Madison that we can see through ou r tongu es. They h ave developed a device to stimulate the tongu e's ability to 'see' and this has allowed blind people to regain vision. One report said: \"The tongue, an o rgan of taste a nd touch, may s eem like an unlikely s ubstitute for the e yes. After all, it's usually hidden inside the mouth, insensitive to light, and not connected to op tic nerves. However, a growing bod y of research indicates that the tongue may in fact be the second-best place on the body for receiving visual information from the world and transmitting it to the b rain. \"Earlier research h ad u sed the skin a s a route for images to reach the nervous sys tem. That people can decode n erve pu lses as visual information when they come from sources other than the e yes s hows how adaptable, or plastic, the b rain is. says Wisconsin one o f the d evice's inventors.\" 27 Research is und erway to see if other lost senses can b e restored by routing them through o ther parts of the body . They will find that they can for the reasons I have described. Most people ca nno t access these inherent abilities beca use they don 't kno w they h ave them and they don 't believe they h ave them. Until they do, they won't. We a re what we think we a re a nd we ca n do what we believe we ca n do . Every part of the hologram has the senses of the whole a nd is conscious. Michael Talbot tells a story in The Holograph ic Universe that gave him an insight into this. He had b een h aving trouble with his s pleen and h ad b een u sing visualisation to treat the problem, using his mind to rebalance the hologram that is the spleen. One night he beca me frustrated with the process and, in the privacy o f his own thou ghts, gave his s pleen a right rollicking for not respon ding qu ickly enough. A few days later he went to see a psychic a bou t his health. She identified the spleen p roblem and then p aused, looking confused, before saying: \"Your spleen's very up set abou t something ... have you b een y elling at you r spleen?\" She said the spleen b eca me ill beca use it thought that is what Talbot wanted. He had been g iving the wrong messages, she said, and no w the spleen was confused at being scalded. \"Never, never get angry with you r body o r your internal organs\", she said, \"Only send them positive messages.\" 2 ~ Big bang baloney A little observation in the light of all this. Science says that the universe was created by the 'Big Bang'. It says that matter was concentrated in a fireball of enormous density and this was all that existed. Then the fireball, or cosmic e gg, exploded and the matter and space it contained expanded ou t from the ce ntre a nd is still expanding. The official theory says this is why the galaxies etc. are still moving away from each o ther. Out of this cooling explosion o f matter came the universe a s we see it, we a re told. But hold on . If there is no matter because matter is an illusion o f the mind, how could there be a \"Big Bang\" of original matter, except as an illusion? The universe, like e verything in the Matrix, is a mass of vibrational thought fields that our minds decode into a 3-D holographic illusion. As a result of this big b ang explosion and the process that followed, the official story goes, subatomic particles emerged. But if waveforms only b ecome particles when they are observed, how could they b e c reated by a process of 'matter' that followed the e xplosion?"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 224 They could on ly b e 'formed' out of thou ght fields by b eing ob served into h olograms. Maybe someone was looking, eh? The universe is the though t equivalent of a c omputer program and just as a software program does not need to explode to b e seen in Windows 200 0, neither does the universe need to explode to b e formed as though t fields observed into ho lographic illusion. Imagine if there was an explosion o f 'matter' every time a though t field was created. It would b e bloody n oisy, wouldn't it? BOO M! \"Hey Ethel, stop thinking will you, I can't hear the telly.\" \"Sorry d ear, I was just think ing we need some more c heese.\" BOO M! \"And some tomatoes.\" BOOM! \"Etheeeee1!\" There was no n eed for an explosion to create the universe. Once the though t fields are projected it's a don e deal. If the galaxies are still moving away from eac h o ther, that is because the 'program' was written that way, not beca use something h ad to go 'bang'. The infinite 'One' In my altered states in Brazil I entered a 'place ' in which I was consciously 'me', but also everything else. This is a state of being that has been d escribed throughout kno wn 'history' by mystics, meditators, people und er the influence of psychoactive drugs, and those who h ave had 'near death' and 'out-of-body ' experiences - those who h ave expanded their conscious awareness to b eyond the Time Loop 's five-sense-reality where a ll appears to b e divided into independent parts. David Bohm and Karl Pribram, two o f the world's leading researchers into holographic reality, agree these out-of-body experiences s ound like what they call the 'implicate order' - the world the five-senses canno t perceive.2Q Mainstream science, the science of the Illuminati agenda, rejects Oneness and p romotes a belief in unconn ected p arts. This s erves the Matrix magnificently. It conditions this belief in the human mind and we then see what we have been p rogramm ed to see - a world o f parts and no t the seamless 'One'. Such a sense of isolation and disconn ection b rings a perception o f being small, powerless and insignificant. This is what the Matrix n eeds to ho ld u s in its s pell. It also means that we seek 'individual' solutions to p roblems when you can n ever find a 'solution' withou t realising that everything is conn ected. A simple e xample is the way 'Western' gov ernments give 'aid' to p oor coun tries while the translational corporations from the 'West' exploit those c oun tries and b leed them dry o f far more wealth than they ever receive in aid. If you don 't view the world econo my as a whole a nd change the way it functions as a whole, you will never solve the 'ind ividual' prob lems and injustices that such an imbalanced whole is bou nd to cause. Viewing everything as unconn ected p arts and no t as a seamless Oneness is vital to the Matrix/Illuminati agenda. It is no acc ident, therefore, that, as I have detailed in o ther book s, the Royal Society in London, the home of establishment science, was created by h igh d egree Freemasons on b ehalf of the Illuminati. The so-called 'classic phy sics' of the materialists beca me the official line from the 17th century with Isaac Newton and the French mathematician, Rene Descartes, who v iewed the world as a machine. This dogma denied the e xistence of the spirit beca use they b elieved they could explain life without a need for one. But like most of the 'facts' pedalled by mainstream science these were not proofs, but mere a ssumptions. According to the book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail,3° Isaac Newton is reported to h ave been a grand master of an elite secret society in the Illuminati web called the Priory o f Sion (see my o ther book s). It claims to go b ack at least to the 12th century and to h ave been o riginally closely conn ected to the Illuminati Knights Templar. Others dispute this, however. The Priory o f Sion says it seeks to advance the goals and influence of the Merovingian bloodline that today manifests as the royal families of Europe, a long list of US presidents and o thers in po sitions of global banking, business and media power. With the advanced esoteric kno wledge a vailable in the upp er levels of secret societies, there is no chance that Isaac Newton was not aware that his version o f materialism, a world o nly o f matter, was a non sense. But how this has served the Illuminati agenda a s it denied the e xistence of the spirit (when you 're dead, you r dead) and viewed the world as a series of parts and no t as one unified, infinite whole. The basis of mainstream science is baloney and those in control kno w it. Stanislav Grof, writing in The Holotropic Mind, says: \"A true scientist doe s not confuse theory with reality and does not try to d ictate what nature shou ld be like. It is not up to u s to de cide what the human p syc he can do and what it cannot do to fit our neatly organized preconceived ideas. If we a re ever to d iscover how w e can be st cooperate with the p syc he. we h ave to allow it to reveal its true na ture to u s.\" 31 The Illuminati are desperate to p revent this, of course. Others are now challenging this dece ption, however, and p eople like the Danish phy sicist Niels Bohr and London University phy sicist David Bohm say that"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" 225 every 'part' is an expression o f one indivisible whole. A gathering army o f real scientists are saying the same. They are a ccepting what mystics and their like ha\\'e been saying all along. Those with op en h earts and minds are beginning to speak the same langu age of Oneness even though they come to this conclusion from different directions. There is no 'empty space' and there are no 'vacuums'. Everywhere is consciousness that conn ects everything to everything else. David Bohm and o thers have e stablished that not only do two p articles act as if they kno w w hat the other is doing, trillions of them do. In fact, all of them do beca use a ll is all. Everything is everything. Behind the a pparent diversity is one c onsciousness. I have heard this explained as a vibration that is travelling so fast that it appears to b e everything, in the same way that if you o rbited the Earth at fantastic speed you w0uld never kno w w here you were a t any po int and you would seem to b e everywhere on the planet at the same time. I don 't buy that. The Infinite doesn't have to travel at such speeds to b e e verywhere. It doesn't have to travel at all. It is already everywhere. It just is. Why would you h ave to move to appear to b e e verything and everywhere when you are a lways everything and everywhere? Bohm believes that we need to look at the world as a ballet dance a nd no t as a c rowd o f uno rganised p eople. The dance is the prime reality, not the 'individual' dancers. But as the poet William Butler Yeats wrote: \"You canno t tell the dancer fr om the dance.\" Our five-senses can on ly p erceive a n almost immeasurable fraction o f the Infinite a nd y et humanity h as been k idded into b elieving that what it thinks it sees is all there is. On a basic level we talk o f the Pacific, Atlantic a nd Indian o cea ns, but they are the same body o f water. Every subatomic particle, atom, cell, organ, limb, body and mind is a mirror of the cosmos. They are the c osmos and the c osmos is them. It is the same with every d roplet of water, every tree, every tulip and blade of grass. In the words of William Blake: To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And. Eternity in an hour. The imprisoned minds of the Matrix may h ave forgotten they are the Infinite, but they are a nd always shall be. The only difference between the Infinite a nd the Matrix is that the Infinite kno ws it is the Infinite a nd the Matrix h as forgotten. You are not Joe Blogg s or Bill Smith; that is only a programm ed illusion. You are all that is: eve rything. Yes, little old 'insignificant', 'powerless', you . We don 't live life; we are life.

What mysteries? Man is what he believes Anton Chekhov (1860 - 1904) I was once interviewed by a Christian radio host and I made the point that Christianity and o fficial 'science' refused to investigate the mysteries of life unless the outcome c onformed to their belief system. \"Welt maybe there a re mysteries that God do esn't want us to kno w\", he said. This is typical of the little me, BIG G OD , concept of mainstream religion that maintains its followers in life-long slavery to a fairy tale. Investigating mysteries with an op en mind is fatal for both religion and establishment 'science' because dog ma can on ly survive if it remains unchallenged. So, dear child o f the Lord, have faith and shut-the-fuck-up. You too, professor. It is not 'God' that doesn't want us to kno w; it is the Illuminati and the Matrix that invented the whole concept 'Of 'God' to serve their ends. They don 't care what you r rigid b elief may b e, so long as you h ave one, and it has ensured you h ave plenty to choo se from. Rigid d ogma = closed mind = the Matrix h as you . As we have seen, once we begin to und erstand reality and ho w it is made manifest, the mysteries of life, unanswerable by religion and mainstream 'science', become rather less mysterious. Different minds, different faces Since the ea rly 1990 s, I have been researching the mind-control technique kno wn as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). As I outlined earlier, this is when the mind is fractured through trauma a nd p rogramm ing into a series of apparent 'personalities' or 'altars', eac h with different attitudes, beliefs and o ften 'ages'. I have sat in a therapist's office a nd seen a 30year-old woman, who h ad b een ho rrendou sly abused since c hildhood, manifest at least seven d istinct 'personalities' in h alf an hou r, including on e of a baby. In line with all 'multiples', eac h 'personality' had its own n ame, background and characteristics, and eac h was brough t forward in turn by the therapist using the c orrect trigger words and codes. The woman was very n ice in 'front altar' mode, but one of her programm ed b ack altars was pure venom when it was activated. What's more, as one 'personality' was switched to another the woman's face changed. This is one of the many 'mystery' characteristics of multiples; their facial features, including eye colour, can change when they switch p ersonalities and so can their brainwave patterns. One 'personality' may b e drunk o r high on d rugs, but when they are switched to another altar they cease to b e e ffected in any way by the drink o r drugs. I have met such p eople. Features on the skin, like moles and scars, can d isappear when on e a ltar replace s another as the c onscious mind. The same body und er one 'personality' maybe allergic to something, but not when o ther altars are a ctivated; a doctor can p rescribe a drug that will have a n effect on the body und er one a ltar, but have no effect with another. It even extends to the fact that they can overdose if a drug is given to an adult altar and they are then switched into on e of their child p ersonalities. They can b e ill in on e mode a nd p erfectly h ealthy in another and they can be spark ou t und er anaesthesia in one personality, yet wake up on the operating table fully conscious if another altar kicks in. Women with MPD can h ave different menstrual cycles with each p ersonality. Another trait is that often multiples don 't age a nything like a s quickly as the rest of us and they can look older or young er, depending on the a ltar in the driving seat at the time. I remember Cathy O'Brien, one of the be6t-kno wn victims of US gov ernment mind-control, telling me that she was not allowed to kno w the 'time' in h er mental captivity and in this period she did n ot perceptibly age. Mind is body and b ody is mind These a pparently astonishing traits of multiple personality disorder are baffling to mainstream science. But from the perspective outlined h ere it is all quite straightforward. The body is a hologram m anifested by mind and the mind's s ense of reality is gov erned by its belief. When these various 'personalities' take c ontrol"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 228 of the body h ologram it changes to match the new state of mind - belief. This can h appen b eca use the body hologram is an illusion o f the mind and the mind can change it in any way it wants. What are kno wn as altars or 'personalities' are simply different realities and when you change the sense of reality you change its holographic illusion. In fact, the different 'altars' are probably different holograms created by the different versions of reality. These different 'personalities' are different holograph ic 'brains', you might say, and the principle is s imilar to having many ho lographic pictures on the same pho tographic film. When you shine the laser at different angles on the wave patterns, you pick ou t a different picture. This is what the 'trigger' codes are doing that activate the different programm ed p ersonalities of the 'multiple’ They are a ccessing different programm ed holograms. That is what the' altars' are. So let us look again at the 'mysteries' I outlined abov e. How can someone be drunk o r high on d rugs in on e mode, but sober when switched to another? The reality that drinks the a lcohol or takes the drugs, accepts that it will become intox icated o r high b eca use that is it's cond itioned and, through the DNA , inherited b elief. It doesn't have to react in this way b ecause the boo ze a nd d rugs are a n illusion, as is the body , and how can the effect of an illusion on an illusion b e real? Do you think the Infinite gets pissed? When an altar - holographic reality - is s witched, the new altar /hologram does not have the reality o f being d runk o r high. How could it? It was not the reality that popp ed the pills or swigged the liquo r. Why shou ld it be a ffected by them? Skin features like moles and scars appear and d isappear depending on the reality o f the mind hologram in control. Maybe a n altar reality was formed b efore the illusion o f the scar or mole \\\",'as there. If so, it is not go ing to manifest something it does not believe in. It is the same with an allergy. If the a ltar- reality does not believe it has an allergy, it won't have one. Withou t the c oop eration o f the mind-brain (consciousness and computer) it can't. The effect of a drug d epends on whether the prevailing reality believes in it. If it does, the drug will 'work', if it doesn't, it will not. Remember, much o f this is taking place on a non -conscious, as well as a c onscious level. The drug g iven to an 'adult' altar that overdoses the 'child' altar is, once a gain, an example of different realities experiencing what they b elieve on conscious and unconscious levels, and through the inherited DNA programm ing. How can it be a ny o ther way? The difference is not the 'phy sical body'; it is the reality o f the mind. Illness and d isease a re illusions. One reality may b elieve it is ill while a nother may no t. When the switch happens the illness will disappear in a flash b eca use it, was an illusion to start with and the new altar hologram does not believe in it. A multiple ca n feel pain in one a ltar and it will disappear in another, just as some a ltars may n eed spectacles, but others will see 20 /20. If you g ive a n aesthetic to on e brain-hologram, and it acce pts the e ffect, it will be off to the land o f nod. But if \"'. another one takes over, how can it be effected by the ae sthetic when it does not have the reality o f having the shot? It can't. It wakes up with no idea what is going on \"what are you do ing with that bloody k nife, mate?\" It's all illusion, as are the menstrual cycles of women. Does the Infinite have a period? Oh, but the woman must menstruate to release the build up o f blood, right? Oh really? Then why could the bodies of some multiples have a continuous period if the a ltars were activated in the c orrect sequence? Where does all that blood come from? Or, if you structured the sequence in another way, they could n ever have a period. Where does all that blood go ? It goes nowhere a nd it comes from nowhere: it is ILL USION ! Why is it that multiples that are disconn ected from the five-sense version o f 'time' don 't age. or at least age a s fast as everyon e e lse? By no w this answers itself. There is no time, so ho w can time a ge us? When you u se a laser to p roject a holographic picture of ,) human b ody it doesn't age no matter how long you leave it there. You could leave it for a thou sand y ears and it would not age a second . Our bod ies are holograms and we c ould do the same. We only appear to age beca use we believe in 'time' and the illusory p assage from 'past' to 'future'. We a ge because we believe we do. Does the Infinite need Botox? The facial features of multiples change a s they switch b eca use our illusory face s merely reflect our sense of reality. Our bodily features are holographic illusions; change the illusion in y our mind and you change the features you appear to 'see'. You switch ho lographic realities. All this is not confined to those with multiple personality disorder; it applies to everyon e. Now, what is another term for this instant transformation o f facial and body features? Go on you sceptics who h ave laugh ed all these years I kno w it's hard, but do try ... shhhh ... yes, almost there ... shhh -ape ... go on y es, yes ... shape- shifting! Exactly. When you see just how illusory ou r reality is, shape-shifting Reptilians are a small deal indeed. Shape-shifting? That Icke's a nutter."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" 229 Since I began writing and speaking abou t shape-shifting, I have, naturally, been the subject of still more ridicule. I und erstand why p eople have dismissed the idea beca use they are so caugh t in the illusion o f the 'phy sical' and canno t perceive of anything that does not conform to its 'laws'. But there is no 'phy sical', it's illusion; and an illusion can take a ny form its creator wants and shift from one to another at will. Visualise a human b eing now in your mind and watch h im or her shape-shift into a Reptilian entity. See, an illusion is anything you choo se it to b e. Accoun ts of shape-shifting b eings, not least those who shift between 'human' and reptilian form, abound throughout the a ncient world, as we have seen. They feature in the a ccoun ts of the same people who said that all was One a nd this world was 'maya' illusion; the same 'primitive people' who are now being p roved right by the c utting edge of scientific research. Let us get down to some scientific basics here. The scientists s ay this 'phy sical' world is made up o f atoms and subatomic particles such as electrons. This is how Michael Talbot describes their properties in The Holographic Universe: \"The e lectron, like some shape-shifter out of folklore, can manifest as either a particle or a wave .. , This chameleon-like ab ility is c omm on to a ll suba tomic particles. It is also comm on to a ll things once thought to manifest exclusively as waves. Light, gamm a rays, radio waves, X-rays - all can change from waves and back aga in. Toda y physicists believe that suba tomic phenomena should not be classified solely as either waves or particles, but as a single category of some things that are a lways s omehow both. These some things are called quanta, and physicists believe they are the basic s tuff from which the entire universe is made .\" 1 People dismiss the a ncient and modern claims abou t shape-shifters when the whole c osmos down to the tiniest particle is in a c onstant state of shape-shifting! For goodn ess s ake a n electron can appear in on e place and then another withou t passing through the 'space' in b etween, the so-called 'quantum jump', But shape- shifting is not possible? Talbot adds: \"The ca pacity to shape-shift from one kind o f particle to another is just another of a quantum's abilities.\" A particle in the blood called the somatid is \"an astonishing shape-shifter in culture\" and \"in rapid p rogression (less than 90 hou rs) it can b e spore, dou ble spore, bacteria, microbial globular form, yeast, ascii, mycelial form, fibrous thallus, etc.\"2 But how can a person shape-shift from one 'body ' to another when they would h ave to do an instant 'swap' of their heart, lung s, liver and so on ? Surely they would die? No, no. I realise it is a massive leap, but I repeat: the body is an illusion, a figment of the programm ed mind. It is really a frequency field, a thought form, and this is how people ca n appear and disappear just like the guy meditating in the woman's hou se. You don 't need you r organs to survive unless you b elieve you do and create that reality. You d on't need to eat and you don 't need to b reathe if you can override the programming that you do. A w oman called Therese Neumann d id not eat or drink for 35 y ears. She began to d rink on ly liqu ids in 1 923 and four years later even stopp ed that. In on e two week p eriod in July 1927, a medical doctor and four Franciscan nu rses kept a watch on h er 24 hou rs a day. They confirmed that she c onsumed no thing and h ad no ill effects, loss of weight or dehydration. 3 This continued for the rest of her life. Taking h er to d inner would h ave been a cheap d ate, eh? \"What would y ou like to eat, darling?\" \"Er, nothin'.\" The body is a holographic illusion and if you r mind is deprogramm ed enou gh you can turn it into a bus if you want. \"Hey, Ethel, I have decided to b e the number 28 to Oxford Street\" - \"OK dear, mind the traffic.\" Michael Talbot says of extraterrestrial entiti es: \" ... if we a re being visited by b eings who are as insubstantial and plastic in form as the bodies [out-of-body experiencers] find themselves in after they h ave exteriorised, it is not at all surprising that they might appear in a c hameleon-like multitude of shapes.\" 4 I emphasised in Children of the Matrix that what we ca ll 'extraterrestrials' are really 'inter-dimensionals'. Our 'bodies' take a form that reflects our state of being and it could well be that the manipulators (sentient programs) projected by the Matrix o ften take a reptilian form beca use their emotionless s tate a nd survival mentality is an expression o f the same basic though t field blueprint or programm e that we ca n ob serve in the e motion less, survivalist, Reptilian species in the Illuminati on Earth. What people see now as extraterrestrials are the modern expression o f the 'fairies', 'elves' and 'little people' that the a ncients claimed to h ave seen. What we can say with certainty is that extraterrestrials and the 'fairies' do no t exist as s olid 'real' 3-D entities. Why so sure? Because nothing exists in that form, except as illusions. 'Extraterrestrial' holograms "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" 230 The ET s and fairies will be, as with everything in the Matrix, frequency p atterns that can take a ny form they, or their creator, choo ses. This is the basis of shape-shifting on ce a gain. It is the frequency p attern that 'shifts' and it appears to the five-sense level that the phy sical body h as s hifted. It has, but only b eca use its base form, a vibrational pattern, has changed and we have c hanged the way we decode the pattern into a hologram. These frequency 'entities' can take a ny form they wish when they und erstand the process. Also, our sense of reality d ecodes these patterns into h olographic form and it could well be that we 'see' these entities in the form that suits our prevailing reality: i.e. the a ncients would 'see' them as fairies, elves and goblins, while we would d ecode them as high-tech 'ET s'. Many p eople have reported seeing 'angels' or had visions of Jesus or Mother Mary. Sometimes enormous s hrines have been bu ilt as a result and the 'visionary' given sainthood . These a re illusions, creations of belief and manipulated thought projections designed to confirm such b elief. The visions 'see' the classic portrayals of 'Jesus' and 'Mary' when those portrayals are only the result of painters who p resented their own idea of how they looked. One of the most famous Christian 'visions' was at Knock, Ireland, in 1879 when fourteen p eople saw the glowing figures of Jesus, Mary and St John the Evangelist near a church. In line with what I have just said, the vision o f St John look ed v ery much like a statue of him in a local village. The figures were so real that the witnesses could read the letters on the book that 'John ' was holding. But when on e of them, a woman, tried to touch 'Mary', there was nothing to embrace but air. The woman said: \"The figures appeared so full and lifelike I could no t understand why my h ands could no t feel what was so p lain and distinct to my sight.\" , The figures were holograms and were no more real than the 3-D image of a holographic pho tograph of an apple or pear. The only difference between 'Mary' and the bodies we think we have is the illusion o f density. Is it now still so incredible that those in control of our collective reality, the Illuminati, are holographic projections or 'sentient programs' and no t 'human' or even consciousness as we perceive it? What are the 'spaceships' that so many p eople 'see'? They are frequency fields and 3 -D illusions and they can d efy the 'laws' of this reality, just as the firewalker does not burn h is feet. Michael Talbot tells in The Holographic Universe how he saw a holograph ic image of a werewolf form around his body when h e was writing a nov el abou t them: \" ... the holographic-like image that enveloped my bo dy was real enough that when I lifted my arm I could actually see individual hairs in the fur and the way the ca nine nails protruded from the wolfish h and that encased my o wn h and.\" 6 A psychic, Carol Dryer, walked into the room and also saw the-'werewolf', but when h e stopp ed think ing about the nov el the image faded. Psychics often report seeing h olographic objects around p eople a nd these are though t patterns in the person's ayra or energy field that the psychic observes into a 3-D reality. Carol Dryer apparently saw potatoes s wirling around a woman's head on on e occasion and it turned ou t she worked for a potato organisation in Idaho. Living to die? Or dying to live? If our bodies don 't exist, except as though t fields and h olographic illusions, how can they d ie? Only if we, and they, through their DNA programm ing, believe they can. Believe in d eath and you will appear to 'die'. Don't believe in it and you can't. By that I don 't mean that you will be c ond emned to live in the body for all infinity; you can d rop the illusion whenever you choo se. I mean the difference between 'dying' as perceived in the present sense and consciously d eciding to leave the illusion in the full awareness that this is what you are doing. Death h as been described as walking in you r mind and that is all it is, a c hange of perception and point of observation. Even if you b elieve in d eath you still won't die in the sense of ceasing to exist beca use you can't. You are infinite c onsciousness. You can 'believe' you r body into the grave, yes, and b illi ons do. But once that has been un loaded you are still conscious in another reality. This is the transformation p rocess behind the 'mystery' of near-death (ND E) and ou t-of body (OBE) experiences. They are only a mystery beca use establishment science canno t explain them. Incalculable numbers of people have e xperienced leaving their bodies on op erating tables or after heart attacks and road accidents only to learn that they h ad 'died' when it was happening (ND E). Others have experienced a spon taneous disconn ection b etween body and mind without 'phy sically d ying' (OBE). The ND E and OBE have a lso b een d escribed in acc oun ts throughou t known 'history'. Both g roups tell basically the same story. The c omm on theme of these experiences is floating abov e the body with mind and sight intact. They can g ive themselves new 'bod ies' in this s tate simply by think ing o f one a nd sometimes they still look like the body they h ave recently left. This is what was called in the first Matrix movie 'residual self-image'. This is the way you r mind is used to"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" 231 perceiving its form and so it continues to do so. People who h ave returned from these disembodied states have said that they h ad no form until they 'thou ght' and then whatever they though t beca me their reality. This is what is happening in the five-sense world, if we only realised, and it is this process the Illuminati work so h ard to exploit. Robert Monroe, a highly experienced 'OBEer', who found ed the Monroe Institute in America, described h is form in the out-of-body state a s a \"vibrational pattern\" made up o f \"many interacting and resonating frequencies\".7 Yes, that is what we are in ou r Matrix state, but not when we a re truly and consciously at One with the Infinite beca use the Infinite in awareness of itself does not vibrate. Only illusion vibrates. Mind thinks all (vibration). Heart is all (stillness). Those who h ave left their bodies also speak o f the feeling o f Oneness, of being everything. But I wond er how many are ac tually experiencing Oneness in its Infinite sense a nd ho w many are experiencing a state that is s imply far more like Oneness than they experience in the Time Loop, the greatest level of illusory disconnection. Most people judge their level of happiness by their le\\'el of unh appiness. They are not actually h appy, but they are less unh appy than at other times and so they take this to b e happiness. Another constant report from ND Eers and OBEers is that they can go anywhere in an instant. As many h ave said: \"1 on Iv h ad to think it and I was there.\" That may b e the perception, but 1 would d escribe it another way: you only h ave to think it and y ou b ecome c onscious of a 'there' where you already are! How? Because 'there' is you . Everywhere is you . 'You' are e verything and everything is everywhere. Why would you h ave to move when you are e verywhere a lready? Where does the holographic body exist when every p art of the hologram contains the whole a nd is the whole? 'Heaven' and 'Hell' Many o f those who h ave had a near-death experience have described in d etail the ac tivity and conv ersations in the room or operating theatre-while they were 'dead' and floating abov e their body. The wealth o f suppo rting evidence is now so enormous that even mainstream science has had to take it seriously, at least on the surface. I read o f experiments in which certain symbo ls were place d on the top o f light shades in operating theatres that only someone floating abov e them could see. \"Hey, doc, you 've got some funny symbols on your light shades.\" Eureka!! Those who h ave e xperienced life without the body invariably tell of a beautiful world o f love a nd bliss from which they do not want to return. They talk o f going through a 'tunn el', meeting d ead relatives and b eings of light, who tell them it is not their 'time' to d ie a nd they must return. For me, these stories mostly d escribe other dimensions of the Matrix. They are e xperiencing less dense realms of the Matrix vo rtex, but the Matrix still has them. These a re the realities to which most consciousness gravitates between 're-incarnations' back into the Time Loop illusion. Interestingly, in line with what I outlined earlier, those with a Christian b elief tend to see Christian d eities and scenes in these near-death states, while a Hindu and b elievers in o ther religions tend to see their version o f where they expect to go after 'death'. They are free of their Earth body , but not free of the illusion. Death is no cure for ignorance a nd the Matrix is full of these traps because it needs to stop its energy supp ly from leaving the illusion, the vortex, and consciously conn ecting with Infinite Oneness. These Hindu , Christian, Jewish and Muslim 'heavens' are as much an illusion as the reality we e xperience. They are frequency p atterns that the still-' disconn ected' mind observes into its holograph ic version o f reality after death'. Someone who commits s uicide in a dark and d esolate state is likely to experience a n illusion o f that - a 'Hell' of their own making. Those overwhelmed by g uilt, who b elieve that their behaviour will cond emn them to alil eternity stoking the fires for the guy with the horns, will likely create that illusory experience. Heaven is an illusion and Hell is an illusion. They are manipulated p olarities created by the Matrix and in many ways the ultimate ones. The holographic illusion extends throughout the Matrix and o nly the vibrational density differs in these different realities. The idea of 'old souls' and 'new souls' is a myth, I would sugg est. These terms only d escribe levels of illusory disconn ection. Another illusion, I would say, is the 'life review', much recoun ted by n ear death experiencers, in which we a re suppo sed to see a ll that we have e xperienced in a five-sense lifetime to h elp u s und erstand what we still have to 'work on ' and learn. Does the Infinite have to go to schoo l when it kno ws everything? Does the Infinite need to h ave e ndless lives on Earth to b ecome e nlightened? Does the Infinite need a 'life review' to d ecide its future c urriculum? Does the Infinite have a n 'old soul' or a 'new soul'? Does the Infinite have to b e turned b ack at the border by 'beings of light' and told that it still has things to learn? Does the Infinite need a religion? Can the Infinite die? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Right, agreed. Then neither do WE!! I t's all illusion. I am not saying that"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" 232 these things are not experienced by d iscarnate entities in o ther levels of the Matrix. I have no doub t that in their reality they are. I am saying that these a re illusions and no t nece ssary. When d isabled p eople have out-of-body experiences their disability disappears and the 'old' can b e 'young ' if only they choo se to think it. All the 'rules' of limitation they b elieved to exist are seen to b e illusions of the mind/brain. Does the Infinite need a wheelchair? Then n either do we - unless we a nd ou r holograms think we do. Mental handicap is also an illusion o f the body ho logram which identifies who it is and what it can do with the 'phy sical laws' its inherited p rogramm ing b elieves to b e real. Can the Infinite be mentally handicapped? No, then n either can we - unless we and ou r body p rogramm ing b elieve in the possibilit y. When someone dubb ed mentally h andicapped leaves the five-sense realm they are no long er 'handicapped'. It is a programm ed illusion o f mind and bo dy. There is a New A ge belief that 'souls' sometimes choo se to experience disabled b od ies in their journey o f evolutionary experience. I would no t dispute that this can happen, just as I do no t dispute the fact that astrology, tarot card readings, and many o f the other New A ge and Eastern techniques can b e extremely accurate in gifted h ands. I am not saying that these are not valid in the realms of vibration, quite the opposite. I am, however, sugg esting that they are phenomena of the Matrix and, as s uch, illusions that can h elp to trap u s if we are not aware of this. I am not a friggin' Taurus, I am the Infinite All. But if I believe I am a Taurus, I will be, and I will identify with b eing a part and no t the whole. There is no David Icke illusion - so ho w can h e be a Taurus? The souls that re-incarnate into different 'bodies' in the Time Loop, as I'm sure they do , are similarly caugh t in the Matrix illusion o f learning through experience when they already kno w everything. Why 'good' and 'evil' need each other How ironic that the greatest human fear is dying (fear of the unkno wn) when we don 't and canno t die. It is this fear that drives the e ngine of the 'health' indu stry in all its forms and h as turned the doctor into a demi- god . Oh, doctor, please save me, I don 't want to d ie!! I und erstand that in hu manity's conditioned state. But the very fact that you b elieve you can die means, that you will experience the illusion o f it and if you believe that the doctor can make things go right it also means that Y01,t accept that things can go wrong . One polarity creates the other. If people believe in the doctor when h e says he will 'cure' them, they will also b elieve in the doctor when h e tells them he ca n't. They 'die' because they b elieve that is what must happen. They think themselves to d eath. After all, the doctor I believe has cured me in the 'past' now says nothing can be don e. See the polarity? The belief in the doctor's ability to h eal creates a belief in the doctor when h e says he c anno t heal. For this reason, as endless research h as s hown, when a doctor tells s omeone they h ave six months to live that is pretty much how long most of them last. They think themselves to d eath beca use of their belief in the doctor. I would suggest that the key realisation h ere is not that the doctor can cure or not cure, but that there is nothing to cure a nd there is no do ctor! I t is manipu lated illusion. A belief in 'good ' must, by d efinition, create the illusion o f 'evil'. How can there be a belief in good if there is not also a belief in evil? Left needs Right in p olitics for the same reason and the 'pros' need the 'antis'. Vibration is the realm of illusion and to vibrate you n eed to create a rhythm, a beat that oscillates between two po ints, as a pendu lum needs to swing b etween two po ints or it must be still. How can a pendu lum swing if it only h as one point? For every 'to' there has to b e a 'fro' and v ice versa. Withou t the two po ints there can on ly b e still ness (the Infinite). The Matrix is illusory du ality and the division o f the One. Look at the laser beam that has to b e divided into two for the holographic pattern to b e produ ced. Though t, too, is illusion. Thinking is not being, just as believing is not knowing. Our loss of awareness of the One means that we have to recogn ise e verything by differences. We kno w w hat is hot because we kno w w hat is cold; we kno w w hat is loud b eca use we kno w w hat is quiet. Without the dualities to compare, everything would just be. The realm of vibrational illusion d epends for its very existence on p olarity, duality, and the whole a genda of the Matrix is to maintain the illusion o f po larity in all things. People have said to me that I am a 'good man'. But I am not 'good ', I just am. A 'good man' is a polarity. Others ha\\'e said I am a 'bad man'. But I am not 'bad', I just am. A bad man is a polarity that provides the oscillation p oint to vibrate with the good man. Polarities are Matrix illusions.

The trick is going into these other realms withou t external stimulus beca use we can do that if it is our reality. In the second session of the a yahuasca in Brazil the voice said to me: \"Do you think y ou are e xperiencing this because of a p lant? Illusion. Ayahuasca is an illusion because plants are illusions. Your mind a ltered itself because it believed in the p lant. \" This would explain how I was able on the first night to snap ou t of the deeply altered state the moment the voice spok e the words \"it is over for tonight\". The e ffect should h ave lasted for far long er, but my mind intervened in the illusion and changed it. I felt il l when I took the a yahuasca simply b eca use that is the effect I believed it would h ave. In o ther altered states I have been able to return to five-sense reality in a flash. How could this be possible if it was the substance that was really controlling the e xperience? Someone with multiple personality disorder can b e drugg ed in on e mode a nd un affected in another, as we have seen. Funn ily enough, a few minutes after I wrote the abov e I was s kimming through a book when I saw a reference to p eople in LSD trials that were given a fake dose or 'place bo' and y et still 'tripped' for hou rs just li ke those who h ad taken the real LSD. Richard Alpert, a psychologist at Harvard, who later beca me kno wn as the mystic, Ram Dass, told another relevant story on this s ame theme. He was travelling near the Himalayas researching the a ffects of LSD. A 'holy man' in his s ixties asked h im for a large dose of LSD and increased it still further until it was massive, some four times greater than experienced 'trippers'. But he was playing with Alpert. The LSD had no effect on h im beca use he knew it was an illusion and if that was his reality that had to b e his experience.' The place bo is a wond erful example of the power of the mind to make its illusions 'real'. Fake pills are used to p laca te people who d emand d rugs not deemed to b e necessary and they are a lso u sed in trials to test the effect of drugs in what are called 'doub le-blinds' like that LSD experiment. Half the people a re given the 'real' drug and h alf the place bo. The power of the place bo to h eal people is extraordinary and some have even b ecome a ddicted to them! The reason is familiar by no w belief. Another form of place bo is to cut people open in the operating theatre a nd sew them up again withou t do ing anything to them. One such trial in the 1950s on p atients with angina pectoris s howed that the 'open and shut' place bo p atients had as much relief as those who were given the normal surgery. Doctors have 'cured' a stream of complaints with a place bo, includ ing warts that have disappeared when a purple dye was applied to them. The patients thou ght the dye was a treatment, but it wasn't, it was a place bo. Remember how people with multiple personalities can h ave warts in some a ltars and no t in o thers? The a ccoun ts abound o f the place bo effect like the man who was given a drug for asthma a nd improved imm ediately o nly for the doctor to b e told later that he had been sent place bos by mistake a nd no t the real drug. Even the e nthusiasm of the doctor abou t a place bo's effect can make a significant difference to the outcome because it gives the patient more a ssurance that it is going to work. People given a place bo in double-blind tests-for chemotherapy d rugs have lost their hair just like those taking the real thing. One of the most famous place bo stories was recoun ted by a psycholog ist, Bruno Klopfer, abou t a guy called Wright, who was s uffering from an extremely advanced lymphatic ca ncer that was all over his body.

Some women are e ven h aving their perfectly h ealthy breasts removed b ecause they h ave been told they h ave a 'cancer gene' that dramatically increases their likelihood o f breast cancer. How insane ca n you g et? But look at the daily bombardment through the media of scare stories abou t new threats of disease or dangers to ou r health. How many p eople develop these health p roblems beca use the possibility is planted in their minds in this way? Fantastic numbers worldwide, I have no doub t. We must allow human cloning b eca use it can h elp to 'fight' genetic disease, we are told. But there is no n eed. Genetic disease, like a ll the others, is illusion! It is the inherited p rogramming o f the body ho logram and we a re more powerful than that if we c hoo se to access and u se that power. There a re published examples of people being cured o f genetic disease through hy pnosis and o f course that is possible beca use it is rewiring the reality o f the mind and the inherited reality o f the DN A. That is what 'DN A disease' really is - an inherited reality! How many more people suffer and d ie from a genetic disease only beca use some igno rant doctor says they h ave the 'gene' that makes them m ore likely to d evelop the problem? I dread to think. How often do we hear that a disease or complaint \"runs in the family\"? Yes, it runs in the family b eca use the family thinks it runs in them. The inherited p rogramming/ disease that is passed on through the family b ecomes their body / mind reality and so they can manifest that. They are not passing on a genetic flaw to the next generation, they are passing on their DNA 's belief in the genetic flaw. Again, all this is happening at subconscious as well as conscious levels. Look ho w doctors describe to their patients the progno sis of an 'incurable' disease and the e ver-worsening stages through which it will go. What happens? It does - if the patient accepts that belief. Alzheimer sufferers are one e xample of this and the same with Parkinson's disease. If the mind o f the patient believes what the doctor says then that is what will happen. \"See, the doctor was right.\" No! The doctor has often p rogramm ed the patient's mind to b elieve that scenario and therefore it happens. It is s obering to po nder on the e ffect of this process in place s like America where the doctor is held in such un questioning awe. I have met some of these guy s and what havoc they wreak. A little kno wledge may b e a dangerous thing, but no knowledge is lethal. This is the reverse of the place bo - believing ou rselves ill. More mind over 'matter' The 'mystery' of stigmata, when p eople bleed through their hands and feet like 'Jesus' on the c ross, is another potent expression o f the power of the mind ov er the illusory bo dy. Christianity h as presented stigmata a s \"it's a sign, a sign\". A sign o f what, though ? Of 'Jesus'? No, a sign o f the person's belief. In the classic stigmata e xperience the blood flows from holes in the hands beca use that is the way that 'Jesus' has been po rtrayed on the c ross in the paintings and statues, etc. But the hands canno t suppo rt the body -in this way and the Romans banged the nails into the wrists of those they crucified. That is not, however, the reality o f the stigmata e xperiencer and it is their reality that their minds make 'real'. Many times the blood flows down the feet to the toes even when they po int their toes to the sky b eca use their programm ed reality recreates the way they b elieve the blood flowed when 'Jesus' was on the c ross. How can the blood ov ercome the laws of gravity? As I said earlier, gravity is an illusion b eca use there are no laws unless we believe there are. When you h ave a dvanced cancers disappearing b eca use someone believes a useless treatment will work and skin blemishes disappear because the patient believes in the power of a useless purple dye, what is the big d eal any more a bou t people with a profound religious belief manifesting the ce ntral symbols of their religion? It is not mind over matter because there is no matter. It is mind ov er illusion. Once a gain the power of the belief and the manifestation as s tigmata c omes from the subconscious level. Experiments with soldiers and o thers have shown that people do no t get tired b eca use of how far they h ave walked so much as how far they think they h ave walked o r how far they think they still have to go . The mind tells the body it is tired. The body is an illusion and can n ever get tired un til we tell it to b e. Neither do we need sleep. We just believe we do and so we go Zzzz zzz.

Look at how many sporting b arriers, like the four-minute mile, take so long to overcome, but once it has happened many o thers do the same and it becomes comm onplace . The barriers are mental, not phy sical, beca use there is no phy sical. Once someone has shown that a feat is possible, the mental barrier dissolves in o thers and they can also do it. Healthy eating? Speaking o f sports and such, we need exercise to maintain a healthy body and we need to eat a balanced diet, right? Well, yes, but only if we think we do. If the body is a holographic illusion, how can it benefit or otherwise from-exercise or this or that type of food ? But if you eat lots of fatty food you will get heart disease, I've read it many times. First of all that research is not necessarily the 'proven fact' it claims to b e and, second , the heart is an illusion and so are the bacon, egg, sausage a nd fries s wimming in the fat. An illusion canno t affect an illusion u nless we think it can. Of course it can't. But the body must need nu trition, surely? No, only if you b elieve it does. What abou t diets? Do p eople lose weight or not beca use of the diet or beca use they b elieve or disbelieve in its effectiveness? The latter, it has to b e. Whether you r body is a thin illusion o r a fat illusion is down to your own mind and its ability ov ercome its own conditioning and that of its inherited ho logram that carries programm ing through the DN A. \"But I drink lots of beer, eat lots of chips and scoff bars of chocolate, so I am bound to g et fat.\" Why? That is what you are told; that is what you b elieve; and that is what you make 'real'. I am not saying we shou ld eat certain fatty food s for the sake of it or spend ou r days with the feet up on the sofa watching the soaps and sport all day, and un til people ca n d isconn ect from consensus reality and their body p rogramming it is far better to eat well rather than consume the c rap the system bombards us with. I am just saying that food do esn't affect you r health unless you r body /mind b elieves it does and when we can free our minds of that programming it doesn't matter what, or even if, we eat. What abou t Therese Neumann who d idn't eat for 35 y ears and maintained her health and weight? She shou ld h ave died in weeks. She didn't die a nd she didn't become e maciated beca use it was not her reality. Physician h eal thy self There is no n eed for a medical system when we und erstand the full magnitude of who we a re and the way we c reate reality. Why do we need surgery when what is 'inside' of us is a holographic illusion that we ca n cl,1ange a nytime we want? The man called Wright might have been treated for his cancer by removing large a moun ts of his cancerous tissue. Yet when h e believed a useless drug would b e e ffective, the a reas of his body that might have been surgically removed h ealed themselves. The man with the seriously b roken leg h ealed by the kahun a would h ave normally h ad surgery and b een in a plaster cast for months. Instead he was healed in minutes. ,The Illuminati pharmace utical cartel is making multi-billi ons by selling u s drugs that don 't work u nless we believe they do and killing u s by planting the belief that they h ave not yet come up with a c ure for something we think we have a nd \"nothing can b e don e\". Their drugs are a lso h aving unpleasant, often terrible, side e ffects when we believe that they do . How many p eople get the side e ffects after they h ave read abou t them on the side of the bottle or fr om their doctor? How many p eople get addicted to h eroin o r cocaine beca use they are told these a re seriously addictive drugs? They can't be. They are illusions, just like the bodies that become a ddicted. How many smokers die of lung cancer because they are told that is what smoking do es to you ? We will take c ontrol of our own 'health' only when we realise that we are in control of it. Doctors and their masters in the drug cartel need to b e erased from our reality on all levels.

Alternative illusions (but more e nlightened ones!) The gathering distrust of the scalpel and d rug medical system has led to an explosion in those seeking h elp from what is called 'alternative' or 'complementary' medicine. This includes an almost endless list of techniques and therapies. including aromatherapy, reflexology, acupun cture, cranial therapy, Reiki, oxygen therapy, colour therapy, sound h ealing, homoeopathy, crystal therapy. on and on it goes. These method s can by-pass the system in that they aim to rebalance the vibrational fields of the patient that have been imbalanced by their mental and emotional state a nd/ or other vibrational influences. This can b e extremely effective in h ealing dis-ease, but unless the patient's mind, emotions and / or environment changes, the imbalances will return. I have been saying for years that alternate healing therapies, as with an und erstanding o f astrology, psychic phenomena. etc. are stepping-stones to the realisation that they are illusions, too. But they are a vitally important bridge that can lead u s out of the phy sical illusion, the densest and most imprisoning o f all, and h elp p eople to b egin the reality shift. This' \" 'alternative' area ca n, however, also b e a trap if people believe they h ave found it and such is the ca se with thou sands of people' I have met around that' world, is with astrology and much o f the New A ge, these alternative forms of healing work with the realm of vibration. Almost all of them are based on b alancing vibrations and energy by u sing other vibrations and energy. Acupun cture balances energy with its needles; aromatherapy with the vibration of smell; colour therapy with the vibration o f colour; sound h ealing with the vibration o f sound; Reiki with energy through the hands; crystal therapy with the vibration o f the c rystal; and ho moeopathy with the vibration o f plants. This is why the homoeopaths dilute the substance of the plant or flower, It is the vibration they are working with no t its 'phy sical' form. The a lternatives und erstand that everything is a vibrational field and that the phy sical body is vibrating energy. But if it vibrates it is s till illusion, stil1 trapped 1 11 the Matrix. While a lternative therapies are a big advance on the primitive beliefs of the medical establishment, they are only a stepping-stone to the realisation that all is created by though t and so all can b e healed by thou ght. The more people turn to these alternatives and b elieve themselves to h ealth, the more strongly o thers will believe from this evidence that they can b e healed and more will. Belief is s elf perpetuating b eca use it creates an alternative c onsensus reality. In an altered state, I was looking at the vibrant colours around me. \"Do y ou think those c olours are real\", said the voice. \"They are vibrations and so they are illusions,\" Colour. it said. is only what we think we see. \"How can the illusion o f colour affect the illusion o f the body?\" Only if we, at some level, think it can. When I got home I recoun ted this s tory and a few second s after I finished I walked into another room to b e faced with the front cover of a magazine headlined \"Colour Therapy - rainbow remedies\". And what are rainbo ws? Illusions. These a lternatives are doing an important job in teasing p eop le out of the densest illusion, but we need to k eep moving to avoid this alternative trap.

On the Isle of Wight where I live in England there a re gho st stories galore of people who claim to h ave seen figures who come a nd go wearing the c lothes of other centuries. There ca n b e many reasons for this. It could b e a formerly incarnate mind that is s o attached to that experience - that illusion - that it continues to 'live it' even after it's body h ologram has 'died'. It manifests another illusory b ody through residual self- image, just as those who h ave had n ear-death. Switching o ff the trees There is nothing that canno t be e xplained on ce we realise that Infinite Love (Oneness) is the only truth and everything else is illusion; and that we a re creating the illusion o r having the illusion p rogramm ed into to u s by b elieving it to b e real. Lyall Watson, the biologist and author of Sllpematllre, tells of watching an Indon esian woman called Tia, a shaman in training, talking to a small girl in a grove of trees. He looked from a little distance a way and she did n ot kno w he was there. She seemed to be e xplaining something to the girl and a sort of ritual of dance a nd g esture began. To Watson's amazement, the grove of kenari trees disappeared and a few second s later came back again. \"One moment Tia danced in a grove of shady k enari; the next she was standing alone in the hard, bright light of the Sun\", he said.1lJ She procee ded to 'switch' the grove on and o f several times as Watson looked o n incredulously. This is impossible surely? No it's not. The grove is a holographic illusion and those with an und erstanding o f how the process works can disconnect from that reality, the c onsensus dream that agrees the grove e xists. With Lyall Watson ob serving this s cene intently it was easy for him to b ecome part of Tia's reality field and also see the grove a ppear and disappear. Someone e lse might have watched this from the illusion o f consensus reality and the grove would no t have disappeared to them. This is how some people ca n walk through walls - they b elieve they can and that becomes their experience. They d isconn ect their mind and bo dy from the laws of consensus reality that insists this is impossible. When I say 'believe', it is a level of belief that is beyond any words that just say 'I believe'. It is not belief, it is a kno wing, a being. There is that age old saying that says we can 'move moun tains'. They can't mean literally? Why no t? If a tree grove can d isappear, why no t a moun tain? The moun tain is a holographic illusion and ou r minds control the illusion. Why can't we move moun tains? We can, but we don 't, beca use we don 't kno w w e c an. Copsensus, programm ed, reality says the very idea is ridiculous and if we buy that reality, it is and ou t-of-body experiences report doing. These substitute 'bod ies' are much less dense than the five-sense hologram and appear, disappear, and move a round in a way that seems impossible to a five-sense observer. But the observer is seeing another level of reality and possibility. Other gho sts and the sights and sounds of ancient battles that people say they h ave seen and h eard can also be the memory o f the battle, the recording if you like, imprinted as a though t form in the e nergy field. By unk nowingly observing this, their minds bring it into h olographic reality like a laser light shining on the holographic print. They 'see' soldiers fighting in the uniforms of history and h ear the sound s of the ca rnage. Such a place is said to b e 'haunted', but it is better described as the ultimate holographic drive-in movie. Battles and wars are e specially effective in imprinting these vibrational memory fields beca use emotion is a major factor in the c reation o f reality and the power of the illusion. You find many g host stories and acc oun ts of hauntings are c onn ected to murders, violence a nd suffering o f some kind, and o ther events of high emotion. These memory imprints - 'hauntings' - are often ob served at particular times in the year and this s eems to b e c onn ected to o ther energy and v ibrational cycles that..·, activate them and allow them to b e to b e seen and h eard more powerfully. W. Y. Evans-Wentz spent two y ears early in the 20th century travelling through 'Celtic' Britain, Ireland and Brittany in France interviewing p eople who h ad experienced the 'supernatural'. In h is book , The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries he includes'-' dozens of accoun ts from people who h ad seen gho stly conflicts and b attles with soldiers in armour or uniforms from the 'past'. Some scenes were silent, some had the noise of battle a nd o thers were only h eard. Evans-Wentz concluded: \"Nature h erself has a memory. There is s ome indefinable p syc hic element in the Earth's atmosphere u pon which a ll human a nd ph ysical actions or phenomena are photographed or impressed. Under certain inexplicable cond itions, normal persons who are not seers may observe Nature's mental records like pictures c ast upon a screen often like moving p ictures.\" 12 This phenomenon is no longer inexplicable, however.

Poltergeist activity h as been widely reported as families being terrified by some force that moves objects, turns on taps, switches electrical equipment on and o ff, and"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 238 sometimes hurls things around the room. But is this really, or always, an 'evil spirit' at work? Many comm on themes have been identified in po ltergeist activity that have led researchers to believe the 'culprit' is the mind o r minds of those being 'haunted', Often the ac tivity is conn ected to teenagers, especially girls, going through a period o f emotional stress. The external phenomenon is a holographic mirror of what is going on with the person emotionally. Everything is conn ected to everything else because e verything is everything. This applies to apparently 'dead' objects like c ups, lamps and ash trays. They are really vibrational fields and at that level they can b e moved by o ther vibrational influences - the minds of people. In turn, these vibrational fields are turned into 3 -D holographic 'reality' by b eing ob served. The minds of people, say a teenage girl, unknowingly interact with the 'inanimate' objects on the level of the frequency fields as they express their emotional state a t that subconscious level of reality. But they consciously 'see' the result of this at their conscious level of reality - the five-senses - with the objects moving and flying abou t the room. Understandably they scream in terror, but they are doing it to themselves!!! When they calm themselves emotionally, their five-sense reality calms down and the 'poltergeist' moves on! There is an important point to stress here. I have just described ho w the subconscious level of the girl imprints a vibrational field with h er thoug hts and emotions (reality) and h er conscious five-sense level observes that field into h olographic illusion. This is the process by which we a ll constantly create our own reality. Just as the teenage girl doesn't realise in h er conscious awareness that she is creating the poltergeist activity with h er subconscious mind, people in g eneral don't realise that their observed reality - their 'lives' - are only a mirror of their subconscious reality. Me a nd my car are overheating The interaction o f mind and machine is another mystery easily explained when we realise that both are One. The mind and its holographic illusion are the same because observed and ob server is the same. This being so, mind and machine must effect each o ther when they are each o ther. When we a re stressed and anxious to g et somewhere fast and u rgently, how many times does the car break do wn? When we are desperate a nd stressed to finish something on the c omputer how often do es the c omputer go wrong ? The more stressed and emotional we get the more powerfully we a re interacting with the vibrational field blueprint of the 'phy sical' object and the more likely it is that we will pass our imbalance - our sense of reality on to the 'object'. In the years after I bough t my first car I was going through a time of enormous emotional stress. I was in emotional overload. I had a series of cars of different makes and states of mechanical competence over these years and y et everyon e developed the same problem - overheating! It got to the point where every time I went-on a journey o f any distance I would worry abou t the ca r overheating. Of cour ~ , this added to the power of the reality and ... the car overheated. Once 1 p assed through this emotional phase my cars stopp ed ov erheating. I had a ca ll from a friend on ce who said she wanted to come up the motorway to see me a nd o thers because she was so emotionally stressed. Half an hou r later she c alled again. She was delayed b eca use her car had ov erheated on the way ov er. If we a re e motionally and mentally stressed and imbalanced, so must be the 3-D illusion that our minds and emotions in that state a re c reating. That mental and emotional state will symbolise itself in the holographic illusion we manifest and the people a nd experiences involved. A calm and p eaceful consciousness will create a calm and p eace ful illusion. This is why I say that you do no t fight for peace, you p eac e for peace. Got the time, mate? Past, present and future a re happening together? That's ridiculous, surely. But it's not. Unless, of course, you think it is, in which case it will not happen in you r reality. We don 't go b ack to the past or forward to the future. We don 't go anywhere because we' are a lready everywhere. There is no time a nd there is no space. A subatomic particle too 'small' to b e seen can ho ld all the information contained in the c osmos beca use it is not 'small'; it on ly appears to b e. Size is an illusion - just as I tell my wife. The particle is the c osmos, as a cell is the body and contains all the information to 'clone' a replica. Every cell is also everything. How can the Infinite One be travelling from 'past' to 'future' when it is already all that is and can ever be? Past, present and future a re just different realities. You h ave a reality o f the world right now and someone e lse will have a nother. They are different realities, but we have no p roblem acce pting that they are happening simultaneously. All I am saying is that it is the same with the past, present and future. They are different realities happening together. But don 't we travel from past to future e very d ay? No, you 'travel' from reality to reality.

I am writing bo th in the same NOW and you are reading it as I am writing it. It is my awareness of one and no t the other that gives me the impression that one follows the other. My reality changes with my changing focus. When I though t I was writing the last chapter I was actually in the same now that I am in as I write this one.

Wow, I kno w the feeling: \"Hello b ackside here I come.\" This is s omething you h ave to just know. If you think abou t it, you disappear up the orifice. The c oncept of 'memory' is another illusion that accepts the e xistence of past time. How could p ast ti me not exist if we have a memory o f it? But memorv is not reca ll from the 'past', it is accessing information stored in another reality experience in the e ternal NOW. And what is this 'past' and 'future'? How many d ifferent realities of the 'present' exist on Earth 'today'? As many as there are minds. Yes, there is the c onsensus reality, but there a re endless variations on this. It is the same with the 'past' and 'future' realities. So what is real? Whatever you think it is. 'Reincarnation', then, is not a process of coming in and out of this 'world' over 'time'. It is moving in and ou t of different realities all happening at once. It is the same with the 'recording' of the gho stly b attles I was talking abou t. Beca use there is no 'time', the 'recording' or 'memory' is actually the battle happening in another reality in the same NOW as the people observing it 'centuries' later. One of the greatest mysteries is how it is possible to p redict the 'future', which endless s tudies have 'shown to b e the case. One e xample is the' chair test' devised by the Dutch p sychic, Gerard Croiset. Investigators would identify p ub lic e vents in h alls across the world that did no t have pre-assigned seating. People sat wherever they chose when they arrived. The investigator would give Croiset a particular seat to focus on weeks in advance a nd h e would h ave to d escribe the person who would sit there a t the e vent. For some 25 years Croiset described the occupants of the seats with incredible acc uracy. Dr Jule Eisenbud , clinical professor at the University o f Colorado, condu cted on e of these tests in 1969 . More than two weeks before an event in Denver, Colorado, Eisenbud contacted Croiset in Holland and g ave him a seat to 'read'. Croiset said the man who would sit in that chair was abou t five-feetnine a nd worked in indu stry and science. In h is job, said Croiset, he wore a laboratory coat that was s tained by a greenish chemical. He said the man h ad black h air, brushed b ack, a scar on h is big toe a nd a gold tooth in his lower jaw. Seventeen d ays later this very man sat in the seat and Croiset was correct in every d etail, includ ing his height of five feet nine a nd three quarters.]) How is this possible? The man in the c hair and the man 'before' he e ven kn ew he was going to that theatre, were not happening weeks apart. They were happening together. They were different realities of mind in the Infinite NOW. Slaves to the clock To h old u s in the illusion, the Illuminati/Matrix condition u s to b elieve in time. When we fall for this, we disconnect from 'no time' - our Infinite state. The movement of the primets, Sun and Moon, night and d ay and' aging b od ies' are a ll designed to sell the illusion o f mov ing from past to future. Look at the way the clock gov erns our lives and the whole of society. Up at this time, out at that time, leave a t this time, arrive at that time. Have you go t the time? Do you kno w the time? What time does it start? What time does it finish? Thanks for you r time. I could b e some time. I might be a long time. There's not enough 'time'. I have too much time. We a re slaves to time. But what is this 'time'. It is the c reation and measurement of an illusion constructed to fool and control us. The meridian system of 'time' based on the imaginary line through London k nown as 'Greenwich Mean Time' was introdu ced by the Illuminati in 1 884 and it was from the Illuminati controlled Vatican that Pope Gregory XIII commissioned the Gregorian calendar in 1582 (see my o ther book s). This was introdu ced by more a nd more c oun tries who accepted the new measurement, of 'time' until it beca me the 'norm'. To make it fit, the British Calendar Act of 1751 'declared that 12 d ays of the following y ear would not exist and that the day after Wednesday, September 2nd 1752 would b e Thursday, September 14th. See how silly the idea of 'time' really is? However you seek to measure 'time' it will always be a n illusion b eca use the c oncept of time is an illusion. Everyon e has linked their sense of reality to the movement of the Sun and Moon, night and d ay, and almost everyon e to 60 second s in a minute, 60 minutes in an hou r, 24 hours in a day.

It is s o ridiculous that you can go to two events and attend the second before the first by crossing the imaginary international dateline a nd g oing 'backwards' in 'time'. The movement of the Matrix-created p lanets and o ther spheres and ob jects have a powerful influence on ou r belief in time a nd also the frequency o f our vibrational fields. It is well known that people a re effected by the full Moon, but these e ffects go much d eeper, as an experiment by Frank Brown o f Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois confirmed. He shipped live oysters from Long Island Sound, California, a thou sand miles to h is laboratory in Illinois to study the e ffects on their biorhythm. The oysters were excellent subjects beca use they op en and close with the tides. At first they maintained the rhythm of the Long Island tides, but in around two weeks they b egan to change a nd they opened and closed in sync with the passage of the Moon ov er Evanston, Illinois.\" We a re being influenced in the same way by the Sun, Moon and the planets, and this, of course, is the found ation o f astrology. These vibrational fields s erve the Matrix magnificently in imposing their fr equencies on u s and confirming that 'time' exists when it does not. The no-time zone I had an experience as a footballer that made me question the nature of time. I was playing in a game one night in London when a guy smashed a shot from quite c lose range. I can recall the e xperience c learly. I saw him strike the ball in no rmal speed and it was moving so fast I was sure it was going to b eat me. But as I moved--· towards the ball everything went into slow motion and all sound disappeared. I dived to my left and pu shed my h and towards the ball, still in slow-mo. Then, as the ball struck my h and and d eflected ov er the bar, everything surged b ack into 'real' time a nd the noise c rashed b ack also as I returned to five-sense reality. I lay on the ground as my team m ates cong ratulated me, but I was in a daze. What the hell just happened? I now kno w that I entered another reality that was not subject to the 'laws' of this one. Sports people often talk abou t entering the 'zone' when there seems to be no time a nd no n oise. In this s tate, they say, they can p erform at their peak. They access a subconscious s tate that is untroubled by the doubt and fear of failure that is s uch a trait of the five-sense self. We only h ave to ob serve our own experience to see how 'time' is relative a nd no t measurable. Sit in a dentist's waiting room and see how slow 'time' seems to p ass. But do something you really enjoy and it seems to pass s o qu ickly, as it does if you are c hasing a deadline. When I worked at a radio station reading the news live on the hou r, I would o ften still be in the newsroom two minutes before the start writing a story or waiting for one. I realised that if I got stressful and anxious those two minutes would p ass very qu ickly, but if I stayed calm they p assed much slower. In truth, they didn't 'pass' at all and the speed that they appeared to p ass was only an illusion o f my reality. Albert Einstein put it li ke this: \"When y ou spend two hou rs with a nice girl, you think it's only a minute. But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute, you think its two hou rs.\" How often h ave you h ad a 'long d ream' in which a great deal happened, only to find that you have only b een asleep for a few minutes? People who h ave e xperienced the near-death ph enomenon reca ll how they h ad a 'life review' in which they saw everything that happened in their life in an instant. How come? There is no time; it is one of the major illusions that ensnares our reality. Those who h ave left their bodies s peak o f being in a place of 'no time', but others have described o ther realms with different time- tracks. The voice' in Brazil told me that the other levels of the Matrix h ave versions of time that are different to ou rs and can appear to b e no-time when they are not. When I went into the 'zone' in that football match, time slowed d ramatically, but there was still the feeling o f 'time'. Oh yes, I see it now ... From the perspective I am outlining in this book, 'mysteries' of every k ind b ecome perfectly logical even for the c ond itioned mind. Here are a few more examples: Telepathy is one 'mind' attuning with another 'mind', which allows both to link, so think, together. Both minds are a ctually on e a nd there is no space between them, only the Infinite that seamlessly conn ects everything to everything b eca use it is everything. Remote viewing, where people go in their minds to ob serve other locations, is possible beca use the viewer is both here a nd everywhere. Remote viewers don 't 'go' anywhere, like A to B, with their minds. They attune their minds to the reality they wish to ob serve a nd that conn ects with them. Much o f what we ca ll mental illness is when p eople operate in a different reality to the 'norm' and appear strange in their behaviour and un able to relate to the 'world' the rest of the pop ulation think they live in.

Aura reading is comm unication with the human energy field, the c onscious and subconscious mind.

If you attune with the subconscious you can read its reality and predict what is likely to h appen when this becomes five-sense reality.

Wright Mills Control of this reality is control of the mind-game through which reality is created. We c an either give our minds away to the c onstant cond itioning o f our sense of self and the world o r we ca n cease to feed those delusions and manifest our own reality. That is the difference between existing in slavery and living in freedom. Understanding how w e a re programm ed to b elieve in the c onsensus 'Matrix' reality is vital to cutting the chains that bind u s to the prevailing illusion. In this chapter I will explore the techniques used to manipu late that sense of reality. It is testament to the power of consciousness that anyon e a t all has awoken from their manipulated d ream, especially in the 'developed' world o f mass media a nd indoctrination. But they h ave a nd the numbers are exploding across the globe beca use the influence of l1luminati programming is no match for the power of consciousness in awareness of that power. Trance-forming It is essential to the oppo se the l1luminati desire that they maintain the pop ulation in igno rance of our true nature while planting messages into the c onscious, and especially subconscious, to p rogramm e the reality that suits the a genda. It is nothing less than hyp notism. All except a few of the six b illi on p eople on this planet are held in an h ypno tic state, a trance, a spell, as they move zombie-like from· conditioned thought to conditioned respon se a nd the c ond itioning is s o total that they b elieve they are making free decisions and choices. Wilson Bryan Key rightly says in his book, The Age of Manipulation: \"Once the group o r collective unconscious is programm ed into what has been called culture, virtually any bill of goods can b e sold at conscious levels.\"! The Matrix consciousness and its l1luminati manifestation kno w the process of creating reality. Society, therefore, has been structured to maintain the illusion. The subconscious is where the though t patterns. are generated that the conscious mind ob serves into h olographic 'reality'; and the subconscious, with its langu age of symbo lism and metapho r, is the Illuminati's prime target to b e conditioned in many subtle a nd less s ubtle ways. One e xample is the massive increase in the number of speed cameras in Britain. Milli ons of motorists are being caugh t beca use their mind wanders for a moment and they are snapped a few miles an hou r over the limit. This brings in enormous amounts of money in fines that the gov ernment says is being spent on introducing more ca meras. Talk abou t paying for you r own prison. The subconscious message of this s ystem is \"don 't relax for a second b ecause Big Brother's eyes are everywhere\". When the police letter arrives with a picture of you r car and threats for not doing exactly as demanded, the subconscious implant of \"do as we say, we are in control of your life\" is s till further re- enforced. The whole process happens withou t the driver seeing a single human b eing. They send you a leaflet with a list of questions they think y ou might ask. The a nswer to everyon e is basically \"there's nothing you can do \". One of them asks if it makes any d ifference that you h ave a perfect driving record with no previous convictions for car offences of any k ind. Is this taken into acc oun t? The a nswer is: \"Speed cameras do no t discriminate, everyon e is treated the same.\" That is the idea. The Illuminati want to remove a s much human invo lvement as possible so there is no weighing o f the c ircumstances, no taking every case on its merits. This is how it is, end o f story. Doing five· miles an hou r over the speed limit in d ense traffic is treated the same as doing the same speed on the same stretch o f road at three in the morning when there is no o ther vehicle in sight. The letters you receive a re worded to imprint fear to illicit the desired respon se. It sugg ests you could b e fined thousands of pou nds if the ca se goes to court, but they o ffer you the c hance of paying a fixed p enalty o f £60! All the time the subconscious is getting the message \"you are und er our control\" and the idea is to p rogramm e that reality so d eeply that the person ceases to rebel and accepts what"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 244 he or she believes is the inevitable. The obsession with 'political correctness' is also a method o f subconscious thou ght control, as I will discuss later. Political correctness is s aying to the subconscious \"we are watching every word you say\". Looking without seeing The targeting o f the subconscious is behind the bombardment of subliminal messages coming at us from all angles as they aim to manipu late behaviour through hu man 'drives' like survival (hunger, thirst, danger of all kinds); sex, greed, social acce ptance, security and territoriality (a big d rive ottl1e reptilian b rain). Subliminal means 'below threshold' beca use the messages are c omm unicated at a level that the c onscious mind doesn't register, but the subconscious certainly do es. The subconscious s ees all while the c onscious notes only a fraction o f what passes through the e yes and even changes much o f that. Subliminal advertising was expo sed in the 1950 s when some television and movie theatre a ds were found to b e transmitting split- second images that the c onscious mind couldn't see to stimulate a desire for a produ ct. This included a subliminal \"I'm thirsty\" during d rinks comm ercials. But the kno wledge of subliminal programming go es back to ancient times with scholars like Plato and Aristotle mentioning the phenomenon and more than 500 scientific papers have been pub lished confirming the e ffectiveness of subliminals. 2 Produ cers of movies like The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre pub licly admitted that .trey contained violent and frightening subliminals. 3 The use of subliminals is s uppo sed to b e illegal in some c oun tries and the Illuminati controlled Alcohol, Tobacc o and Firearms (ATF) in the United States s ays that subliminals are inherently ~ dece ptive beca use the c onsumer does not perceive them at a normal level of awareness and is given no choice whether to accept or reject the message. Funny then, that nothing is don e a bou t the subliminals that abound in advertising, let alone in p olitical manipulation. The US Federal Comm unications Commission, currently h eaded by Colin Powell's s on, Michael, a Bush appointment, has no regulation barring subliminal advertising, but generally considers it dece ptive, it says. Again, why no action? The picture in Figu re 54 carries a very clear subliminal message, or at least it's clear when it's pointed ou t. Can you see it? Apparently, abou t five per cent seethe subliminal at first sight and the rest are a mazed when it is made c lear to them. If you h aven't seen it, look at the white a reas and no t the plants. Your eyes go to the, plants, but it is most often in the background that subliminals are posted. We c onsciously see the a pparent focus of the a d while the background p asses us by. Look at the lower level of the two p lants on the left and you will see that they combine to make the letter S in the white background . Move your eyes right and you 'll see a n E and an X. Oh y es, of course, I can see it now. Why couldn't I see it before, it's s o ob vious? Until the subliminal was explained, the c onscious mind was not in the game, only the subconscious. Once it is high lighted, the c onscious mind registers the word b ecause it is no long er subliminal or below its threshold. Every time you look at that picture from now on y ou will see that once-subliminal word immediately. It is crucial to comm un icate the manipulation techniques and method s of the Illuminati beca use once people und erstand ho w they work they are no long er subliminal and can b e c learly identified. Hey, and gu ess what they call these subliminal additions to advertisements? Embeds! Yes, the c hoice of the term 'embeds' or 'embedded' for the journalists assigned to milit ary u nits is no acc ident. This is what those journalists really are e mbedded d istorters. They are subliminal embeds planted to give the a ppearance of journalism while merely reporting the official line. I have often said that the Illuminati manipulate the people by manipulating the image they h ave of something, rather than with the detail. They kno w that people don 't retain d etail from the television o r even n ewspapers. They go away with an image, a feeling, abou t a person o r event. Tell the people something ov er and ov er and at the level of the image, the feeling, they will overwhelmingly accept the image to b e a true picture of events even though there is no d etail to back it up. They k eep 'repeating the same mantra over and ov er like 'weapon s of mass destruction', \"al- Qaeda was respon sible\", and “it was Bin Laden\". This is s imple hypnosis."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" 245     Figu re 54 : Can you see the sublimina l message in this image. Appa rently about 5% of peop le see it immediately I see no sex Sexual themes are used in subliminal advertising on a monumental scale. The subliminal word 'sex' is incredibly common in advertisements, as is 'fuck'. Contrary to what many assume, we are not a sexually open society, but a seriously sexually suppressed on e. We a re largely in d enial of our sexuality and ou r desires, but much as people may wish to d eny them they don't go away. Denying something gives it more power over you and can become a n ob session. People hide their sexual feelings beca use they are a t odd s with what the mass hypo crisy dictates is 'moral' and 'decent'. Stuff that. I have a simple philosophy: do what you like so long as everyon e involved h as made a free choice to b e involved and there is no compulsion o r manipulation to do so. Once those criteria a re met, who cares what other people do? It's no on e's business, but theirs. For goodness s ake, it's all an illusion anyway. Is it immoral for an illusion to h ave sex with an illusion, even with more than on e? What? \"Ooh, I think it's disgusting what those people next doo r get up to.\" Well don't do what they do then, darlin'. Most of the time, beyond the denial, they'd actually love to go next doo r and join in. But no, \"that's disgusting my mother said\". You g et those campaigners against pornography who cond emn some video as disgusting and d epraved while watching one a fter the other. It's all in the name of research, see. The tabloid media is full of sexual themes and p ictures designed to attract readers through the genitals while c ond emning p eople in the public e ye for their sexual antics. It is the old carrot and stick technique; pull them in and then pu sh them away. \"Here is s omething you 'd like ... no, no, you can't have it, it's immoral\" Lionel Rubinoff wrote in The Pornography of Power: \"Hypo crisy which takes the form of a denial of hypo crisy is hypo crisy squared.\" 4 What happens as a result of all this' is that the subconscious is drawn to sexual themes while the c onscious is in d enial of them and this is one major reason why advertising subliminals are overwhelmingly sexual. Look at the picture in Figu re 55. The image itself is quite overtly sexual in this case, but I wond er if you can see how much more blatant it is on a subliminal level? Take you r eyes to the waistline of the jeans, just left of centre a nd follow the ca refully d esigned shading upwards from there. See it? You could h ardly miss "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 246 it once it is high lighted! Again, whenever you look at that picture from now on you will spot the subliminal immediately b eca use it has registered with the c onscious mind. You see ads with men n aked from the waist up o r women n aked from the back and such like beca use the mind 'fills in' the rest consciously o r unconsciously. Such subliminal images are n o t ran at all. It is s taggering how comm only they are used in advertising o f all kinds. The Ponald's ad in Figu re 56 is s uppo sed to b e for chicken. Maybe I have lived a sheltered life, but I've never seen any p art of a chicken that look s like that. I have seen d icks that look like that, but not chicken. Maybe it's a rooster. Next time you see a c an o f Diet Coke (for you r sake don 't drink it!) look at the glass on the lower left. Hold the ca n at arms length away from you and you 'll see women's breasts. The subconscious is attracted to the sexual theme while the c onscious mind is s upp ressing its sexuality and, in effect, denies the sexual implants and do esn't see them. To confirm the point, people accessing the subconscious during hy pnosis and those in more sexually op en societies s ee subliminals far more ea sily. The find ings of Viennese neurosurgeon, Otto Poetzle, in 19 17 sugg ested that information implanted subliminally appears in d reams and involves the same denial to hide taboo images. The penis might appear in the Figu re 55 : A sexua l picture, but the subliminal makes this far more blatan t. Can you see it? dream in the form of a banana, for instance, or, if you're not so lucky, an asparagus. At the website of Jim Hagart's Semi Subliminal World, you can find subliminals highlighted in o ther Coca Cola produ cts like Dr Pepper, Lilt and Fanta. s They include distorted faces, 'gremlins' and the usual sexual themes. By the way, the target market of Diet Coke is overwhelming ly women and the subliminal use of women's breasts is an example of the technique of planting subliminals of women's s exual parts in ads aimed at women and men's in those targeting men. Being attracted to p eople of the same sex is even more taboo and the denial of the conscious mind hides the subliminal from view even more e ffectively, while a ttracting the subconscious to the a d. That is why they do it. Wilson Bryan Key is one of the world experts on subliminals and h as produ ced a number of highly recomm ended b ooks on the subject. He writes: \"In a visual perception, as little a s 1/1000 of the total perception registered in the b rain a ctually s urfaces in consciousness. The remainder lies dormant within memory.

Emotionalized, repressed information remains in the memory sys tem for long periods, perhap s for a lifetime. In e mbedded p ictures, nothing is actually hidden - certainly not by the a rtist. Once viewers learn p erceptual flexibility, 'the e mbeds'- are readily available to consciousness. The only thing h idden in embedded media is what viewers or listeners hide from themselves. Repression a ppears to be a compulsive p rocess, probably initiated to protect oneself from unsettling information that would p rovoke anxiety.\" 6 For this very reason, many are in complete denial of the e xistence of the global conspiracy and its other- dimensional expression. It is just too much for them to take e motionally b eca use of the perceived implications for their own lives. Thus people like me a re dismissed as crazy o r dangerous by many withou t any reference to the e ndless detail and evidence a vailable. It is the 'shoo t the messenger' synd rome when you d on't li ke the message. You can g ive these people a s much suppo rting d etail and evidence as you like and they will still be in d enial. I had a guy call in to a South African radio show I was on who went into long-winded Figu re 56 : McDona ld's Chicken Mc Dickets. Ever seen one of the se on a chicken? explanations for why eac h element of the c onspiracy was explainable without a c onspiracy. It was not worth debating with him beca use no matter what scale of evidence you p resented h e would h ave to find a way to deny the c onspiracy. People suppo rt despots like Bush and Hitler beca use they try to p ersuade themselves that their leaders have the people's best interests at heart. To face the fact that they are vicious dictators with a Nazi agenda is too much to b ear. They d eny the obv ious over and ov er until they canno t deny it anymore. By then it's too late. This happened in Nazi Germany and is happening in the United States and Britain today. Frontwards, backwards, upside down The subconscious mind no t only absorbs everything, it perceives what it sees from all angles. There is a whole a rea of research these days into what is called 'reverse speech'. What someone is s aying when their words are played b ackwards also comm unicates with the subconscious. It is claimed that when you p lay sentences backwards you can h ear what the person is really s aying even though in forward speec h they appear to b e saying the oppo site. I have heard some political speec hes played b ackwards to me and there certainly appears to b e truth in this. It is the same with reversed p ictures like the one highlighted in Figu res 57 and 58 . When the picture is the right way up it appears to b e a simple; even bo ring, advertisement for a flooring company.

An advertisement’s to motivate a decision to pu rchase days, weeks, or even months after it has been p ercei v ed for even an instant. The job o f an ad is to sell - not to b e reca lled.\" 8 Key says minds that operate in linear reasoning (deeply entranced by the five-sense reality) appear more susceptible to subliminals. This is s till another motivation o f the Illuminati to maintain the population in the five-sense illusion. You can buy p aper today implanted with subliminal messages of you r desired theme. When you send a letter or circular the person thinks they are only reading the words they can see. In truth, their subconscious is also absorbing the message they can't see hidden in the paper. A class of eighth g raders took a self-esteem test in 1983 on paper implanted with the subliminal message, \"You are loved\". They scored 15 % higher for self-esteem than those who took the test with non -subliminal paper. When the same test was given to und er achievers they scored 34 .7% higher with the subliminal embeds. 9  Figu re 57 and 58 : This appea rs to be a simple. even bo ring ad vertisemen t, un til you turn it up side down.

All of our senses are targeted by the subliminal mc1nlpu lators. Messages are played to u s just outside the frequency range that our hearing can consciously acce ss. These subliminal words byp ass our conscious awareness and enter our minds at a subconscious level. I came across an advertisement on the Internet for subliminal tapes designed to manipulate people to h ave sex with you . “Imagine ... Only 5 -10 minutes use required to program another person's mind and your advances can n ever be rejected!\", said the a d. \"Imagine ...

Thanks.) The recording indu stry includes s ubliminal audio p rogramm ing in its products to manipulate the consciousness and reality o f the buy er. Dr Hal C. Becker patented a black box in the 1960 s to pipe a udio subliminal messages on top o f another audio source. It was used in stores to p lant the message \"don 't steal\" and theft dropp ed by 37 %. Think ho w sophisticated and und etectable such techno logy must be now. If it can tell you sub liminally not to steal, it can also tell you to bu y, buy, buy; who to vo te for; and what to think. Such subliminal instructions are pou ring from our televisions, CDs and the media in all its forms. Even most people involved with the media have no idea this is go ing on. \"Dooo whatever weee saaaay \" In the John Carpenter film, They Live, the main character finds s pecial glasses that allow him to see the subliminals. Without the glasses he sees normal advertisements for Coke or holiday d estinations and articles in magazines, With the glasses he sees the subliminal instructions \"obey\", \"don't question authority\" and 'I do as you are told\", This is happening around u s all the time. With the glasses he also saw similar messages in 'news' magazines and Bryan Wilson Key h as indeed identified subliminals in magazines like Time. In on e example when the US gov ernment was targeting Libya's Colonel Gaddafi his cover picture was embedded with the subliminal words \"sex\" (attraction to the magazine and \"kill\" (to plant negative feelings abou t him) The a nti-Gaddafi propaganda ca mpaign was condu cted by CIA D irector William Casey and op erations officer Vincent M. Cannistraro answering to Secretary o f State, George Shultz, the a dvisor to George W's 'election' campaign and a major player in Bechtul, which h as benefited so h andsomely from the invasion o f Iraq. Time also pu t the word \"sex\" on the forehead o f the Ayatollah Khomeini on the front cover on November 26th 19 79, acc ording to KeyY These are the people telling you what is happening in the world, includ ing who was respon sible for 9/11! Another piece of subliminal kit is the tachistoscope projector that flashes words and images onto the screen for millisecond s, far too qu ick for the c onscious mind to ackno wledge. These are used in film and video produ ction and advertising. People c onn ected to instruments while watching tachistoscope subliminals did not report a c onscious awareness of any stimuli, but the a lpha a nd theta waves in their brains were e ffected and so was their heart rate. The manipulation o f lighting and b ackground sound is also u sed in conjunction with the visuals. Other subliminal techniques include the dou ble meaning o r double e ntendre when a sexual or other meaning could b e taken from a phrase or situation that can h ave a nother more mund ane explanation; and 'dissonance', when something is incongruous or· out of propo rtion to the picture. Lying to ourselves It is not only ou r sexual supp ression and taboo s that subliminals target. They manipulate a ll human emotion, denial and d efence mechanisms. Fear, as always ~ is the main on e: fear of death, fear of aging, fear of anything they think will be e ffective. Wilson Bryan Key writes: \"To avoid anxiety, overload, we construct perceptual defense mechanisms to either limit or distort our perception o f reality.\"13 Repression of our fears and feelings provides the major distortion b eca use we delude ourselves into b elieving ou r own self-dece ption. Psychiatrist R. D. Laing d efines repression as when \"we forget something, then we forget we have forgotten\".14 We believe our own lies beca use we have forgotten we have lied in the first place . Research has revealed ho w emotional security, confirmation o f self worth, gratifying the e go, a sense of power, sense of roots, fear of financial hardship and fear of death o r desire for imm ortality can all be influenced subliminally. This need for security and self worth is manipulated mercilessly by advertisers and gov ernment spinners. The 'war on terrorism' targets almost 100 % the fear of death and the desire for perceived safety and security for self and family. But before you can control people through such fears you"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 250 have to make them fear m the first place . The 9/11 attacks make them fear and you exploit t hat fear consciously and subconsciously to justify the 'war on terrorism'.

The more fearful and insecure you are, the m ore the Matrix h as you . Dr William Sargant, a psychiatrist with the Illuminati Tavistock Institute in Britain, wrote in his 1957 book, The Battle for the Mind: \"Various types of belief can be implanted in pe ople after brain function has been de liberately disturbed b y acciden tally or deliberately indu ced fear, anger, or excitement.

The bloodlines and their Illuminati network are obsessed with symbolism and their symbo ls and codes going b ack thousands of years can clearly b e found throughout American society and the rest of the world, especially the c oun tri e s of the British Empire. The a ncient Illuminati symbol of the pyramid with the ca pstone missing o r the py r amid and all-seeing eye was place d on the dollar bill in'19 ~ 3 by p resident Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the high ly significant front men for the Illuminati in the United States during the 20th century. The most obvious Illuminati symbol is the eternal flame or the lighted torch and this represents the 'Illuminated on es', the' initiates illuminated into kno wledge that the rest of the popu lation is denied. The Illuminati lighted torch is most famously h eld by the Statue of Liberty. This was given to New York by French Freemasons in Paris who kn ew w hat she a nd the torch really symbo lised. There is a virtual mirror image of the Statue of Liberty on an island in the River Seine in Paris (Figures 59 and 60). As the blood lines came up into Europe a nd across the world they naturally b rough t their symbo ls with them. The Statue of Liberty is the symbolic image of the godd ess worshipped by the Illuminati bloodlines s ince they were based in Babylon (and b efore). She goes und er many n ames, includ ing Queen Semiramis, the \"branch b earer\", who was s ymbolised as a dov e. If you look at Figure 61, you can see the image of Queen Semiramis on an ancient coin and compare that with h er representation as the Statue of Liberty. When the Illuminati bloodlines moved their headqu arters to Rome, the godd ess was worshipped as Venus Columba or \"Venus the Dove\". The French word for dov e is s till colombe. This is why a man who signed h is name \"Colon\" is kno wn to o fficial history as \"Columbus\". He was bearing the branch o f the dov e into the Americas in 1492 and was given this s ymbo lic name relating\" the Illuminati godd ess. We have the' centre of US gov ernment located in Washington DC - the District of Columbia, or the dov e, Semiramis. We have British Columbia in Canada, Columbia Broadcasting (CB S), Columbia University, and ' ~ Columbia Pictures with the symbol of the woman and the lighted torch - the symbol of Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz in Babylon. The Illuminati use what I call reverse symbolism. They place their symbols all around u s, but present them with the reverse of their true meaning. The dov e symbolises peace to most people, while to the Illuminati bloodlines it represents their godd ess, Queen Semiramis. The lighted torch means freedom and liberty to the pop ulation, but to the Illuminati it is the very symbol of their agenda a nd control. The Nazis reversed the ancient symbol of the swastika to symbolise the negative a nd Satanists have reversed the pentagram or five- pointed star to po int downwards for the same reason. Everything is s ymbolism and ritual to the Illuminati, and always has been'. After they k illed President Kennedy in Dallas in 1963, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry p lace d an ob elisk In Dealey Plaza with a lighted torch at the top. When they bu ried Kennedy Arlington Cemetery in Washington DC they place d a lighted torch, the Illuminati eternal flame, on his grave. The spot where people leave their tributes to the murdered Princess Diana in Paris is a massive representation o f the flame held by the Statue of Liberty. It is located on top o f the Pont de L' Alma Tunn el where the Illuminati arranged for her to d ie in 1 997 (see The Biggest Secret for the background to Diana's murder and the 'Godd ess Diana' symbolism involved). The name Capitol Hill is also Illuminati symbolism and n amed after Capitoline Hill, a sacred p lace for the Illuminati outside Rome during the Roman Empire. The more that I und erstand abou t the manipulation o f the subconscious, the more the Illuminati obsession with symbolism takes on an even g reater significance. These Illuminati symbols s peak to the subconscious and implant messages relating to control and \"we're watching you \" while the conscious mind is oblivious of what is going o n beyond its perception. The Illuminati use of code words and ph rases are designed to h ave the same e ffect.

Stewart Swerdlow confirms what I have been saying in my book s for years \"the Illuminati love symbolism, dates, name derivatives and dou ble meanings that cryptically tell the truth while hiding it from the general pop ulation \".17 He says that the 'Santa Claus' story is an example of this. The myth o f Father Christmas or St Nicholas is an o ld Pagan tale a nd h e was depicted wearing g reen. It was Coca Cola who g ave him a red suit in a massive a dvertising campaign and h e beca me kno wn as Santa - an anagram of Satan. Swerdlow writes: \"Satanism and Satanic rituals have g rown e xponen tially s ince the media b litz of the Red Santa. This subliminal method instils in the mind-pattern that a mystical, non hu man can en ter peop le's homes. He will be g ood to them only if they behave in a certain way during the year. The red costume speaks for itself - red is the color code for entry into the a stral planes. Red is the color code u sed b y the goddess during Reptilian ritual to invoke a stral entities. \"Of course, Santa 1 ives at the North Pole, which is an en try point into the inner- Earth, and the underground Reptilian society. He ha s s hort little e lves that do h is work, symbolic of the small greys with a g roup mind pattern. The flying reindeer and sled symbolise the inter-dimensional flying craft used to enter there. Children a re a dvised to lea ve Santa a snack for his arrival, representing a sacrificial offering to a p owerful god . In a ddition, the commercialism surrounding this artificial Christmas holiday is designed to e xtract any religious intentions as well as enrich an a lready wealthy global elite.\" 18 All the major symbols of 'Christmas', including the tree, holly and mistletoe, come from Pagan festivals. Swerdlow also h ighlights the en ormous number of television p rogramm es for children that present reptilians as their friends and he says that the bab y in the ~ centre of the Sun, as dep icted in the Tellytubb ies s eries for small children, is a reptilian religious sy mbol. \"The b aby at the centre of the Sun indicates that this bab y is a sacrifice to the Sun God.\" 19 Selling the president All the subliminal techniques used by advertisers to sell products are used by the gov ernment spinners who are, after all, just selling a president, prime minister or policy in the same way that Coca Cola sells canned drinks. One of the more crass and incompetent attempts at subliminal manipu lation came in the Bush presidential campaign in 2000 when a political ad p lace d by the Repub lican National Committee flashed the word 'RATS' over a Gore prescription d rug p roposal (Figu re 62). It was left up too long in the same way that a subliminal flash o f President Francois Mitterrand was s potted in the opening titles of a French n ews programm e when h e was seeking election. The Bush 'RATS' tape only h ad to b e slowed do wn slightly to b e clearly visible. Let no on e kid themselves that subliminal messages (or \"subliminable\" as George Bush"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 253 called them) are not pou ring from po litical advertisements. Note how the background b ehind Bush is always full of pictures of his family when h e is anno uncing the ce rtain d eath o f families in coun tries his masters want to conqu er. It is all aimed at the subconscious. Operation Iraqi Freedom, the title the Pentagon spinners gave to their human slaughter in Iraq, was devised for\" the same reason. The names for these milit ary invasions are designed solely to d epict what the spinners want the pub lic to b elieve the war is all abou t. Any n ews organisation worth associating with the name journalism, would ackno wledge th ~ _ ~ title Operation Iraqi Freedom once when it was first announ ced and then n ever mention it again. To do so is to kno wingly allow you and you r viewers to b e manipulated. Instead, when I was in America during the war, I saw news networks like CNN and Murdoch's Fox News, displaying \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" on the bottom of the screen for much o f the time. That was s peaking constantly to the subconscious while the conscious mind was watching the pictures on the rest of the screen. It was a disgrace , but then most of those that control such o rganisations are intellectual prostitutes anyway, so what do they care? And I'm not sure abou t the intellectual bit. Figu re 62 : G otcha ! The Sub liminal implan t of ‘RATS’ in a Bush comm ercial attacking Al Gore in the 2000 election campa ign . It was no t sub liminal en ough and could be seen b y sligh tly slowing do wn the tape Speaking with forked tongue The manipulation and supp ression o f language is crucial to the mind p rogramm ing o f the people a nd the conditioning o f reality. Words are the method o f comm unication in the five-sense realm and they are targ eted big time by the spinners. The c onn ection b etween the manipulation o f words and the manipulation o f thou ght and p erception is fund amental. This can b e seen\" in the technique ca lled Neuro Lingu istic Programm ing o r NLP in which p olitical leaders and speechwriters, lawyers, salespeople, etc., are trained. I have seen NLP described as \"software for you r brain\" beca use it allows you to \"automatically tap into the kind o f experiences you want to h ave\".2o Maybe, but like a ll knowledge, it can b e used another way to tap into the kind o f experiences you want others to think they are having. Does anyon e believe that politicians, lawyers and salespeople learn the techniques of NLP primarily for personal growth o r beca use they wish to manipulate the pop ulation, judges and juries or potential customers? NLP was developed in the 1970 s from the techniques of people like Dr Milton Erickson o f the Milton Erickson Found ation in Phoenix, Arizona, and the found er of \"Ericksonian Hypno sis\". This involves comm un icating \"with the whole person by utili zing conscious and un conscious levels\" and teac hes \"how to u tili ze a nd byp ass client resistance by embedding therapeutic interventions in seemingly casual conv ersation\".21 Bypass client resistance? Cut the Orwellian language a nd it means mind manipu lation, tapping into the unconscious mind without the person's conscious kno wledge to p lant the though ts you wish them to follow. NLP claims to train students to read o thers by no ting their eye position and choice of langu age a nd so on With the manipulative use of NLP the idea is to pu t you r target into a trance state withou t them realising it, just as a skilled hy pnotist can do. Dick Sutphen, an expert in subliminal programming, said that if a sugg estion o r comm and is given in this s tate, \" ... the sugg estions are not challenged by y our conscious mind, they are a ccepted by you r subconscious, which b egins to create the circumstance necessary to change you r life so it will match you r new beliefs\".23 Or creates the circumstance necessary to change the beliefs of someone e lse. This trance state is vital to mind p rogramming b eca use the c onscious mind stands aside to allow the subconscious to b e accessed, for though ts to b e planted. The trance state is, appropriately, connected to the most ancient part of the human b rain, the R Complex o r reptilian b rain. "},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 254 Newspeak The use of langu age for mind-control was highlighted most famously by George Orwell in his classic, 1984, which was written in 19 48 and pu blished the following y ear. Orwell (real name, Eric Blair) was heavily involved in British p olitical life a nd it was not purely from imagination that he c ould foretell so acc urately the Big Brother society we a re e xperiencing. He c ould see it coming. Orwell used the term, 'Newspeak', for the langu age of manipulation and supp ression. In Orwell's nov el, the state controlled media use Newspeak and o ther linguistic trickery to spread its propaganda a nd b rainwash the pub lic. Orwell explains in his essay Politi cs and the English Language, how \"Political langu age ... is designed to make lies s ound truthful and murder respectable a nd to g ive a n appearance of solidity to pu re wind\".24 Or, as he puts in 198 4: \"War’s peace. Freedom is s lavery. Igno rance is s trength.\" 25 In the society p redicted by Orwell, the names for gov ernment ministries were chosen to p resent the oppo site meaning to their true function. The Ministry o f Truth was there to falsify records; the Ministry o f Peace was the one that orchestrated the wars; the Ministry o f Love was \"the really frightening one\" that questioned and tortured suspects; and the Ministry o f Plenty p roduced fake figures to conv ince the people the ec ono my was doing well when there were major shortages beca use of the endless wars being fought. The forced labou r camp was named the Joycamp. This is what we have today. Ministries of information are there to spread disinformation; ministries of defence launch wars of conqu est; departments of homeland security are there to secure control; \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" was designed to hide the truth that it was really Operation Iraqi Slaugh ter and Conqu est; t he term 'democracy' is used as a c over for dictatorship. Orwell's manipulators, like those manipulating ou r minds today, repeated the same statements over and ov er in the kno wledge that in d oing so it would indoctrinate the people to b elieve them through sheer repetition. The mantra a bou t 'weapon s of mass destruction' was a most obvious example a s the pub lic were prepared to accept the invasion o f Ir aq. Pupp ets like Bush, Blair and Powell knew precisely what they were doing as they b ashed ou t the same phrase hou r after hou r. Watch for the repeated messages and you 'll see what you are being p repared to accept next. Orwell's Ministry o f Truth changed n ews items and do cuments that cast the a uthorities in a bad light. Once the original document was replaced it was destroyed. Orwell writes: \"This process of continuous alteration was app lied not only to n ewspapers, but to b ooks, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets ... Day by day and a lmost minute b y minute the past was brought up to da te. In this way every prediction made b y the Party c ould be shown b y documentary evidence to ha ve b een correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record.\" 26 This is what happens when the present Fourth Reich finds 'documents' that suppo rt their claims and o thers that \"expo se\" those who challenge them. Hiding reality A major aim of Newspeak is to u se words to und erplay the horrors and injustices inflicted by the manipulators and to emphasise their 'victories'. Orwell gives an example of how the policy o f bombing defenceless villages from the a ir and forcing p eople from their homes is called \"pacification\" and milli ons of peasants robb ed o f their farms with no more than they can carry is called \"transfer of pop ulation o r rectification o f fr ontiers\".27 In modern wars, like the invasion o f Ir aq, we hear the constant repetition o f the term \"mopping up op erations\". This disgu ises the reality b ehind \"mopping u p\" - killing anyon e still resisting the tyranny after the main b attle is over. There is also the obscene term \"collateral damage\", which is Newspeak for slaugh tering civilians in the name of fr eeing them. \"Pre-emptive strikes\" is Newspeak for mass murder and conqu est by attacking first. The US Justice (Injustice) Department produ ced a law w ithin the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 to allow the gov ernment to strip American citizenship from anyon e giving \"material suppo rt\" to any g roup d esignated as terrorists. The [In]Justice Department naturally d ecides who are c onsidered terrorists. But how can they take a way someone's US citizenship when this is s pecifically forbidden by the Constitution? By Newspeak. \"Material support\" for terrorists is a Newspeak ph rase that means \"any suppo rt we decide is s uppo rt\" and section 501 o f the ac t says that Americans can vo luntarily give up their rights to citizenship pu rely by their behaviour. To q uote the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 255 Newspeak: \" ... an intent to relinquish n ationality n eed no t be manifested in words, but can b e . inferred from condu ct\". If you , in the opinion o f the [In]Justice Department, give \"material suppo rt\" to terrorists (the designation o f which they d ecide) you are voluntarily giving up you r rights to citizenship. Once that is don e you r constitutional rights are e nded. First they p ass 'anti-terrorist' laws to do what they' like with foreigners they dub terrorists or suppo rters of terrorism, as with those held without charge, trial, or lawyers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and then they u se this all-embracing Newspeak clause to take a way the c itizenship of those Americans they are targeting so they can ho ld them indefinitely without charge, trial or acce ss to a lawyer. Another comm on Newspeak ph rase to justify g rotesque inequality o f wealth distribution is: \"We don 't believe in p un ishing p eop le beca use they are successful.\" You h ear Tony Blair say this a lot. This moves the e mphasise of the \"victim\" of injustice from those working their butts off to make it through another week to those making a fortune e xploiting those working their butts off to make it through another week. When George Bush announ ced tax cuts that benefited p eople like teac hers and firefighters by $350 to $500 a year and multi-milli onaires by $8 8,000, the White House spok esman and master of mendacity, Ari Fleischer, said those very words: \"The-president does not believe in p un ishing p eople beca use they are successful.\" 28 Big brother speaks Here are a few of Orwell's Newspeak terms coined in 19 48 that are so relevant to what is happening today. Crimethink : to even consider that the a uthorities could b e wrong in any way. Crimestop : to instinctively change you r thought processes whenever you are in d anger of breaking the law of crimethink and n ever listening to views that expo se the ruling cabal. This has been d escribed as \"protective stupidity\". Thinkpol : the Though t Police who's role is to eliminate c rimethink through spy ing, surveillance ca meras, etc. Blackwhite : to accept whatever the a uthorities s ay withou t question and, as Orwell, put it \" ... loyal willingness to say b lack is white when p arty [gov ernment] discipline demands this. It also means the a bility to b elieve that black is white, and more, to know black is white, and forget that one has ever believed the contrary\". Duckspeak : to speak withou t thinking, as in quacking like a duck. Facecrime : to show any facial expression that Big Brother surveillance c ould interpret as having something to h ide. This could b e a look o f anxiety o r failing to reac t to o fficial statements or alleged \"victories\" in the correct manner, including not cheering when a war was won. Doublethink: the refusal or inability to see c ontradictions and to h ave two contradictory beliefs in your mind at the same time while believing them both to b e true. This comm ent by boy George Bush is an example: \"See, we love - we love freedom. That's what they d idn't understand. They h ate things; we love things. They act out of hatred; we don 't seek revenge, we seek justice out of love.\" This asks us to b elieve that love = mass murder of civilians. This is an apparently impossible c ontradiction or dou blethink, but tens of milli ons of Americans and o thers 'believe that both are true. Doub lethink, and therefore c rimes top (refusing to think anything ill of the gov ernment) are essential to tyrannies beca use their whole found ation is based on contradictions and lies. The c haracter called Winston in Orwell's 1984 defined d oublethink o r doub lespeak as: \"To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully c onstructed lies, to ho ld simultaneously two op inions which cancelled ou t, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to u se logic against. logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, t o be lieve that democracy was impossible and that the Party [government] was the g uardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, t hen to draw it back into memory aga in a t the moment when it was"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 256 needed! and then p romptly to forget it aga in: and a bo ve a ll, t{)app ly the same process to the p rocess itself. That was the u ltimate subtlety: consciously to indu ce un consciousness, and then, once ag ain, to be come unconscious of the a ct of hypnosis y ou had just performed. Even to u nderstand the word 'doublethink' involved the u se o f doublethink.\" ~ 9 Newspeak today The Orwellian society is now all around u s, gathering p ace by the hou r, and n aturally a vital compon ent of the Illuminati thought control today is, as Orwell envisaged, the manipulation o f language. Here a re some of the real meanings behind modern Newspeak that the spinners constantly work to camouflage. American interest: the interest of those who control the United States and anyon e who resists that control is acting \"against American interests . National security : the security o f the a uthorities to h ide their agenda a nd the c ontrol of the people through increased security to meet manufactured d angers. World comm un ity : you h ear this mantra pou r fr om the mouths of the globalists like Bush, Powell and Blair. It implies that 'free' nations are bound together in pu rsuit of fr eedom, peace a nd morality as a \"world comm unity\" when, as we saw w ith Iraq, this is Newspeak for American and British tyranny on b ehalf of the Illuminati. \"World comm un ity\" is also d esigned to p repare the way for the a cceptance of the world gov ernment Anti-government groups : any o rganisation that seeks to h igh light and challenge gov ernment dictatorship. They are, therefore, dubb ed highly d angerous anarchists or potential terrorists. Extremist : anyon e saying anything different to the gov ernment-supported no rm (see a lso \"militant). Redistributing wealth from m ega rich to starving p oor is considered \"extremism\" by those in po wer. Conspiracy theory : any claim that the gov ernment is lying and following an agenda hidden from the people. Change : a big Newspeak word that means to introdu ce the Illuminati global society by creating p roblems and und ermining the status quo to b ring abou t the perceived n eed for \"change\". The word \"reform\" is used in the same way, not least by Tony Blair, who claims that people a re e ither \"reformers\" (those who accept change in line with the a genda) or \"wreckers\" (those that resist such change).\" Right and Left Conservative and Liberal : terms designed to p resent every issue a s black and white polarities and ob scure the fact that there are more than two sides to every d ebate. Nation bu ilding : after bombing and invading a target coun try you place a pupp et gov ernment in power to represent you r interests while c laiming it is a gov ernment chosen by the native people. This ensures the coun try is run by y our dictat, but withou t your overt control. We don 't want people to realise that a campaign o f global conquest is happening b efore their eyes (or visual cortex). Peacekeeping : occupation o f a c oun try by foreign troop s. Peace process : giving the impression that you are working for peace when it is merely an interlude before launching more c onqu est through war. Terrorist: those who p rotest. through violence, but also anyone who attacks or challenges the interests of the west, especially America, Britain and Israel, or stands in the way o f further conqu est. Liberation : mass murder and terrorism against civilians in the name of stopp ing terrorism that’s nothing whatsoever to do with the people you kill or maim for life. War on terrorism : the c onstant repeat of this process. "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 257 Attack : when America a nd Co are the target. Retaliation : when America a nd Co attack. First-strike : When America a nd Co attack first in retaliation for what America a nd Co claims their target coun try could do to them (see also lies). Self-defence : killi ng the other guy b efore he even thinks of killi ng you. Western values: these a re values you want to impose on o thers, but don 't have you rself. Mythical belief in the 'West' as the good guy s appearing over the ridge to kill them baddy Ind ians. See a lso John Wayne. Campaign contribution : bribe. Affirmative action : racial discrimination that affirmative ac tion is s uppo sed to eliminate. The only way to do achieve racial equality is for everyon e to b e c hosen on their merits irrespective of their colour, creed o r background (see fairness, and justice) and for everyon e to h ave an equal opportunity to d evelop their talents. Edu cation : brainwashing. Tidying up exercise : the phrase you u se when you want to make major changes while disguising them as insignificant. This was used to lie to the British p eople a bou t changes to the c onstitution o f the European Union that pretty much removes what is left of British sovereignty. It was only a \"tidy ing up exercise\" to \"streamline\" existing legislation and make the EU more \"democratic\". Classic Newspeak. Goo d citizens : slaves that do no t protest at being s0 o r even realise that they are. Equ ality : make e veryon e a slave. Democracy : elected, or even un elected, dictatorship in which the majority o ften vo te for the losers. See also tyranny o f the uninformed majority. Crime : breaking a law passed withou t our agreement no' matter how ludicrous it may b e. Freedom of the press : freedom to report the official version o f events . Human rights : the right to do what the gov ernment tells you . Tolerance : do no t criticise or challenge the behaviour of anything and anyone, no matter what the circumstances. Zero-tolerance : tyranny . Free trade : using slave labou r to make you r products in the world's poo rest coun tries for a few cents and expo rting them without tariff charges to the richest coun tries to sell for top-of-the-range prices. Also means to du mp you r products in any coun try you wish and d estroy the local econo my and livelihoods of the world's poo rest people. Competition : translational corporations competing to see which can exploit t he global popu lation most effectively. Capitalism : cartelism. Isolationist : anyon e who do es not want to d ictate to o thers and control the people of other nations. Level playing field : fixing the system in favou r of those you wish to win."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 258 Propagand a : whatever you r oppon ents s ay b ecause you on ly tell the truth, Freedom : slavery The distorted u se of these words arid o thers is designed to plant a false reality into the c onscious, and, especially, subconscious mind. This manipulates peoples to see themselves and the world in a way that suits the a mbitions of their leaders. 'Hate c rime' = Thought Crime One of the most powerful expressions of the Orwellian though t po lice is the so-called h ate c rime. In Canada they h ave a 'Hate Crimes Unit' and there a re other versions of this around the world like the Commission for Racial Equality in Britain that is dominated by . people with their own agendas to pu rsue. Such organisations are in d aily search o f those who are e xpressing a view that the Though t Police deem is inciting racial hatred. You can even b e c harged with a \"hate c rime\" for revealing true information that the thou ght police decide c ould \"create a n atmosphere\" in which racial attacks or \"crimes\" could take place . To sugg est that the official story o f what happened to Jewish p eople in Nazi Germany is not 100% correct is to be branded a \"hatemong er\" and a \"racist\" by reflex action. No further debate is necessary for the psychological fascists; you are an \"historical revisionist\" (Newspeak for \"racist\" beca use you challenge the official version o f history) and you must be ca stigated and cond emned to pu blic vilification. George W. Bush called those who qu estioned his lies abou t Iraq as \"historical revisionists\" in the hop e that the tainting of that term would und ermine his gathering critics. But strangely, if anyon e says that the horrors of the Pol Pot genocide in Cambod ia were e xaggerated o r that the Irish d id n ot suffer as much as they claim from British rule a nd the potato famine, this is not considered racist or a sign o f hatred against Cambodians or the Irish. So isn't that racist to cond emn on e opinion o f history and no t the other? Why shou ld Cambodians or the Irish suffer such d iscrimination by the Hate Crimes Unit? Surely that makes the Hate Crimes Unit guilty of a hate crime? Arrest them, I say. Jewish p eople ca n state they would n ever drink from a bottle of wine that had no t been op ened by a Jew and that's fine, no p roblem. But a white person who says he would no t drink from a bottle of wine that had no t been op ened by a white person is called a racist. Personally I don't care e ither way, just get me a glass. The 'Jewish' press can talk o f the \"plague of Jewish-Arab marriages\" without any consequences (and no r shou ld there be, however repugn ant the c omm ent might be). But if the Arab p ress talked o f the \"plague of Arab- Jewish marriages\" they would b e branded anti-Semitic.30 Jewish p eople ca n say they are the race c hosen by God and abov e a ll other races, but when a white person says that his is the master race he is branded a racist and a \"white supremacist\". There a re no chosen p eople or master races, white, Jewish, or blue with pink spots. There is only on e c onsciousness. The body is a hologram, an illusion, so all claims to racial superiority o r inferiority are the work o f the minddead and the same goes for those so ob sessed with race that they look for racism everywhere. The point I am m aking, however, is that the Onvellian concept of the 'hate c rime' is extremely arbitrary (though give it time) and basically d epends on \"'\" the power wielded by those c ontrolling the policies of the hate c rimes authorities. 'Hate crime' legislation is not abou t protecting minorities from discrimination, that's the movie. The real reason for 'hate crime' laws is to stop legitimate debate a nd the free-flow of information and o pinions that do no t suit the manipulators. \" Once you start making a person's though ts and o pinions a c rime to express you are living in a totalitarian state. It is not racial hatred to sugg est that official history is not correct, just as it is not racist against Americans to say that the official story o f 9/11 is a lie from start to finish. This non sense is exploited to stop proper investigation into p eople and events and h as nothing to do with stopping racial hatred.

In h is book, Legend s of Our Time, this Jewish writer wrote: 'Every Jew, somewhere in h is being, should set apart a zone o f hate hea lthy, virile ha te - for what the German personifies and for what persists in the German'. Not 'the Nazi', but 'the German'. For this s ermon of hate he received the 1 986 Nobel Peace Prize from the Norwegian Academy, in company with the Cambodia- destroyer Henry Kissinge r and the Kana-murderer, Shimon Peres. Armed with this recogn ition of the Norwegians, Elie Wiesel called (at Christmas Eve!): 'War [with Iraq] is the on ly option'. If you n eed to feel guilt, feel guilt for this Nobel Peace Prize. \"This vast difference in the feelings of Norwegians towards their national genius Hamsun and towards Elie Wiesel, the schmaltzy hate-monger, leads us to a conclusion: in p revailing po st-WW II mainstream discourse, the taboo on criticism of Jews has c aused strong b ias and undermined the hu manist idea o f the Equa lity of Man. Pre-war anti-Semitism has been superseded b y ano ther extreme, philo-Semitism, a be lief that Jews c an do no wrong a nd shou ld n ever be referred to e xcept in the most complimentary terms. This equally racist attitude ha s c reated severe misbalance in po litics and d iscourse. It has to be corrected in order to save o ur planet and mankind from the triumphant 'Semitism' of their definition.\" 31 How can it be \"anti-Semitic\" to highlight the number of people loyal to Israel who are behind the wars of American conqu est in the Midd le a nd Near East that transform the Arab lands in line with Israel's desires? Or to state how many p eople loyal to Israel control the media a nd the flow of information? Would it be racist to po int this out if the architects of the Bush po licies were dominated by Arabs and American troop s invaded Israel? If highlighting bias is going to b e denoun ced as racist, we might as well all walk away and let the world burn. Yet when British po litician, Tam Dalyell, notes the obv ious conflict of interest between the number of Israel-supporters in the Bush gov ernment and their po licies favou rable to Israel, he is dubbed an \"anti-Semite\". If you are talking abou t racial inequality, where does it lie in this case? Canadian writer Henry Makow, whose grandp arents were victims of the Nazis, cond emned the a ppalling treatment by the American and Canadian authorities of Ernst Zund el, who was dubb ed a \"hate criminal\" for questioning the official story o f the Holocaust. Civilised societies treat all people the same no matter what their colour, creed, background o r op inion. Tyrannies do no t, and that means Canada and the United States are tyrannies. Makow w rote: \"Zundel's c laims are repugnant, but he ha s a right to be wrong. Society need s people to d ispute the historical record. One may be right. I f spreading false information is a crime, shou ldn't we a lso lock up [US news anchor man] Tom Brokaw? Canada ha s locked up Ernst Zundel. According to h is wife, he is being mistreated in prison. He risks dep ortation a s a 'security ·risk'. Bernie Farber of the Canad ian Jewish Congress c oncede s Zunde l doe sn't 'actually wield the stick' but 'provides oxygen' to e xtremists. That definition would curb eveyone’s freedom of spee ch. \"When q uestioning the truth becomes 'hate', we ha ve en tered Orwell's '1984' era of though t crime. Don't kid yourself. This is the slippe ry s lope to tyranny and Jewish o rganizations are p artly to b lame. We must stand up in d efiance. The charge of hate is used selectively to d isarm legitimate oppo sition. The definition of 'hatred' is very s elective. For example, lesbians s pew hatred of men bu t they are n ever arrested. Feminists teach impressionable g irls that all males are po tentially violent sexual predators. That's OK. The Talmud is full of hatred aga inst Christ and Christians, but that doesn't count either. \" ... Jewish organizations dishonor Holocaust victims by using them for political purposes. It is tasteless to cast Jews as the world's premier victims. Humanity is one family and no g enocide is more important than ano ther. To u se 'hate' to d isarm opposition to the Zionist agenda is also repugnant. It leads to tyrann y and more an ti-Semitism. For Ernst Zundel to den y or understate the Jewish Holocaust is grotesque. But it is no t a crime. In these q uestions, only the truth matters. Let the truth spea k for itself. Let Zundel be judged b y it.\" 32 This is a vital po int if we wish to live in freedom. Either we have freedom of expression o r we don 't. You can't be a little bit free. You either are or you aren't. If you want the freedom to say what you want then you must give the same freedom to all others and d efend that right when it is challenged, even if you don't agree with them.

Look again at what the Nazi Propaganda Minister, Dr Joseph M. Goebbels, said: \"The lie can be maintained on ly for such time a s the State can shield the p eople from the political, econo mic, and/or military c onsequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to u se a ll of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth becomes the g reatest ene my of the State.\" All dictatorships want to curb this basic right to express you r though ts and o pinions, but 'anti-racist' organisations and p eople who h ave targeted me, like Bernie Farber of the Canadian Jewish Cong ress and a Canadian lawyer called Richard Warman, at the a mazingly titled Canadian Human Rights Comm ission, want to d ecide who h as free speech and who do es not. Their like ca n b e found across the world, but the moment their right of expression is challenged they are the first to squeal. Actress Brigitte Bardot was threatened with legal action for' attacking Islam, homosexuals, the unemployed, teac hers and illegal imm igrants, and calling for a return o f the guillotine. She made the c omm ents in her boo k, Un Cri Dans Le Silence. She said g ays were fairground freaks, teac hers arrive a t work with g reasy hair wearing d isgusting jeans and mudd 'y:tr ~ iI1ers, and that 'the professional unemployed' don 't even want to work illegally We may find h er views either appalling and laugh able, but they are her views and she has a right to them. What she does not have a right to do un challenged is force her views on o thers or seek to introduce discrimination on the basis of her views. But would' you rather live in a world in which she c ould express her though ts, unpleasant as they may b e, or one in which the Thought Police dictated to h er - and therefore you - what you could and could not say? Her freedom of speech is actually y ours. If everyon e is not free then no one is. Israel Shamir makes the point very well: \"Millenn ia b efore the Great Cultural Revolution, the Chinese knew the secret of harmony: the n on- Manichean balance of opposing ideas, the principles of Ying and Yang. Properly balanced, Jewish idE!as can be beneficial: anti-Christian zeal would limit Church e xcesses, just as materialism and egoism can keep the feet of Man on the g round while h is head is in h ea ven, feminism can balance male chau vinism, and the sex obsession o f Freud can balance the a sceticism of spiritualists. Balanced, even Zionism will shrink to the humane proportions of Jewish love for Palestine. But balanced it shou ld be . Crackpot correctness The reign o f terror called 'political correctness' (PC) is Orwellian thought control or crimethink. I have yet to work ou t who d ecides what is 'political' and what is 'correct', but it certainly h as nothing to do with anyon e I kno w. Let us just think, or crimethink, abou t this for a moment. We a re a llowing some unknown 'authority' to d ictate what we can and canno t say with ou r own freewill. What?? The vehicles for its imposition are the robo t radicals with their hearts on their sleeves and their brains in the place where the Sun d on't shine. They b elieve that we must remove a ny words, phrases or opinions that might upset anyon e. Unless, of course, you are a target of these people for you r allegedly p olitically correct words, phrases or opinions, in which case they seem to h ave no p roblem with hu rling the very abuse in you r direction that- they would cond emn if it was issued from the mouths of anyon e e lse. The 'PCs', or Purveyors of Claptrap, are yet another Orwellian tyranny . In an article headed \"Politically-Correct Censorship Rampant in US S choo ls\", the Australian Su nday Times reported the insane results of 25 y ears of political correctness. The a rticle focussed on a book by Diane Ravitch, a former American gov ernment official, called The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn.34 A reviewer in the Chicago Sun -Times said the book would cause readers to gnash their teeth as they read o f the outrages against comm on sense. 35 Ravitch says: \"Some of this censorship is trivial, some is ludicrous and some is breathtaking in its power to du mb do wn what children learn in school.\" 36 She reveals that a story entitled The 'Friendly Dolphin was rejected by on e schoo l committee because it discriminates against students who d id n ot li ve near the sea. A story called The Silly Old Lady was rejected b ecause it contained a \"negative stereotype\" of an elderly woman {who pu t too many gadgets on h er bicycle. Another entitled A P erfect Day for Ice-Cream had to b e rewritten withou t reference to ice-cream because of a ban in California on any mention o f junk food. Other concepts banned by the Though t Police included disobedient children, ghosts, parents who qu arrel, ski trips and b irthday p arties. In some schoo ls, dinosaurs canno t be mentioned b eca use they imply a theory o f evolution that not all Americans agree with. Such"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 261 lunacy was being routinely introduced across America, Ravitch said, and the same is happening in Britain and elsewhere. These decisions are being made by the Orwellian \"bias and security\" panels that advise state education bo ards what children should read. Ravitch says that these panels operate \"an increasingly bizarre policy o f censorship\" that has been \"stripping away everything that is potentially thought-provok ing and colourful from the texts children are to encoun ter.\"3? Note that: stripping away anything that is \"potentially thou ght provoking \". That is the idea a nd the a genda behind po litical correctness, as it was in Orwell's Big Brother society. The Official Politi cally Correct Dictionary and Handbook by Henry Beard and Christoph er Cerf38 shows how far down the road we have travelled. A person confined to a wheelchair is called \"differently abled\"; a person without a job is \"unwaged\" (the c onstant use of the prefix 'un' was part of Orwell's Newspeak in 198 4, as in \"ungood \"); to b e disabled is now to b e \"phy sically challenged\"; your partner is you r \"significant other\" to avoid the \"sexual stereotyping\" of boyfriend, girlfriend, husband o r wife; if you are shorter than average you are \"vertically challenged\"; George Bush is not stupid, he's \"mentally challenged\"; a waiter or waitress becomes a waitron; women are wimyn o r wimm in to avoid \"man\". Mailman should b e personp erson then and manhole needs to b e personho le? Then you h ave a bleism, ageism, lookism, sizeism, weightism; all of them straight from. the Orwell dictionary. Political correctness now includes avoiding sports at schoo l that invo lve a nyon e winn ing o r losing. It might upset them, see. But why then don 't they ban all exams to avoid winners and losers in aca demia? Oh, it's OK to win if you excel in the c lassroom, but not if your gift is on the sports field. And that's '!he point. These mind-fascists s ay they want to celebrate the diversity o f people a nd then spend all their time destroying it, not least the diversity o f the language. Yet more dou blethink. When op inions or descriptions deemed un acceptable to these zealots are e rased from use, it forces people into a land o f saqleness, mediocrity and the inabilit y to communicate what they really think and feel. The zealots decide what is right and wrong , acce ptable a nd incorrect. They are mind-police, nothing less, and the ultimate racists, ageists, ableists, lookists, sizeists, weightists and chauvinists beca use they are more obsessed with identifying such p eople than anyon e e lse on the planet. I see a n o ld lady and they see a potential victim of discrimination on the grounds of age. I see a woman and they see a potential victim of discrimination on the grounds of her sex. It is now politically incorrect to say\" that someone is \"crippled\". Why? What are we suppo sed to do , encourage them to b e Olympic c hampion for the one hundred metres? They will have other skills and abilities that an Olympic c hampion will not have. So celebrate those advantages instead o f being ob sessed with the disadvantages. I have a right hand mangled by arthritis that I canno t use e xcept for one finger to type. I am basically disabled in the right hand and no t so g ood in the left, either. So what am I then? Differently abled? No, call me c rippled if you want, I don 't give a damn. It does not matter unless it matters to me. Surely what we shou ld b e doing is encouraging p eop le to see that how others describe them doesn't matter; to free them from being effected by labels, whatever they are. When we impose rigid d escriptions we emphasise the differences by d eveloping a 'special' term for those that want to b e treated like e veryon e e lse. You can't call people mentally h andicapped any longer; they are \"people with learning difficulties\". But why do they h ave learning difficulties? Because they have a mental handicap. What have I got with the phy sical handicap in my h ands then, digit turning difficulties? I worked closely with the mentally handicapped for years and they are incredible people with abilities, not least in the way they can express love, that are a wond er to b ehold. What an insult to them to say that they must be called by some manufactured ph rase because they might be upset or suffer discrimination. They're bigger than that, even if the though t-censors aren't. People have different abilities, bodies and challenges. That's what makes for the glorious diversity o f life. Why do these a gents of discrimination want to h ide that when it should b e a source of celebration? I can't catch footballs any longer like I did when I was a goalkeeper because it's too painful. But I still intend to take Manchester United and the Miami Dolphins to court for the blatant discrimination o f not playing me in their first team just beca use I have a crippled h and. One of the most insane e xamples of political correctness came in my home town o f Leicester when po lice raided a woman's hou se a nd took away h er collection o f china pigs after complaints from local Muslims. They said that the display o f model pigs were \"racially o ffensive\" to them. 39 Not as offensive a s their idiocy is to me, mind. We shou ld b e tackling real discrimination on the grounds of handicap, race , or sex, not inventing a new industry o f nonsensical Newspeak and po litical correctness that insults the intelligence of all invo lved. But, then, from the Illuminati's point of view, it is not crazy at all. "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 262 Method in the madness We shou ld not be kidded by the ridiculous words and terms s pawned by the censors of political correction. Yes, it appears so b reathtaking ly d umb and many o f its igno rant practitioners are. But behind that is a coldly calculated plan that has been long in the making. In 19 84, Orwell's Newspeak changed the langu age to remove the words that described po litical ideas at odd s with the official position and a major· aim was to reduce the number of words available to p eople. This is the true reason for political correctness and the gathering lack o f emphasis on expanding the vocabulary o f children and students. Orwell knew that as you reduce the number of words available, you contract correspond ingly the ability to express you r thoughts as \"Yours. To supp ress words is to supp ress though t, or, as Orwell said: \" ... if thou ght .corrupts language, language ca n also corrupt thou ght\". Listen to p oliticians and. the military in their public statements. They use glib ph rases that lack the c lear meaning that a bigger vocabulary o f words would o ffer. They don 't want to b e specific, that's the idea, and incomprehensible Newspeak jargon is used for the same reason. The further you reduce the words (and through the generations even the awareness of them) the more bland comm unication b ecomes and the desire to write a nd read book s will diminish. Blandn ess is what the manipulators are looking for and any words that make a c lear statement are targeted. Wilson Bryan Key writes in The Age of Man ipu lation abou t his experience of writing a speech with o thers for US President Dw ight Eisenho wer: \"For thirty-six s leep less hours, three writers turned ou t draft after draft, reviewed b y a White House depu ty press s ecretary who offered terse comm ents like, 'Much too specific!' 'Ease up on factual references!' and 'Take it back and fuzz it up!' 'Fuzz it up,' we d iscovered eventually, meant avoid a ll clear, factual statements about anything more specific than the time o f day ... The speech was end lessly discussed for likely aud ience reactions, belief and a ttitude reinforcements, and implied mean ings ... Would an yone take the empty rhetoric s eriously? The speech read smoothly, but said ab solutely nothing a bout anything. This was precisely what it was intended to say. During audience interviews after the o ration, most expressed satisfaction with the g reat man's words. 'Ike really ga ve it to them!' 'He ha s my vote!' 'I like the way he thinks!' Great speech!'\" 40 The manipulators want to reduce the words available to express a though t and, through this, influence what and ho w people think. When the words to express a though t have gon e, so h as the though t beca use in this reality we think in words. The same happens to memory which canno t be c onsciously retained withou t the ~ words to express it. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary d efines Newspeak as: noun , usage: often capitalized; propagandistic language marked by euph emism, circumlocution, and the inversion o f customary meanings. Etymology: Newspeak, a langu age 'designed to diminish the range of though t,' in the nov el 1984 (1949) by- George Orwell.\" There you h ave the key motivation o f Newspeak: \" ... to d iminish the range of though t\". A Newspeak engineer in 19 ~ 4 says they are cutting Newspeak to the bon e a nd every y ear there will be fewer word ~ to u se. \"In the e nd we shall make thou ght crime literally impossible beca use there will be no words in which to express it.\" To do this, the Orwellian controllers targeted what they called .\"Oldspeak\", the language that had d eveloped ov er thou sands of years, and also \"Old think\", those ideas and attitudes resistant to the 'change' and 'reform' demanded by those in po wer. When Donald Rumsfeld d escribed the resistance by Germany and France to the Iraq war as an example of \"Old Europe\" this was another attack on Oldthink. Political correctness is an example of the e nforcement of Newspeak, but mostly it takes over simply by repetition o f use. Orwellian prophecy George Orwell's vision o f the new tomorrow was s uch a mirror of what we see today bo th in the outcome and the techniques used to achieve it. He featured a \"revolutionary g roup\" called the Resistance that the Orwellian authorities claimed was led by the e vil, Emm anuel Goldstein (see Osama bin Laden and endless· others). The Resistance a ppears not to h ave really existed, but they were blamed for every ill. One of the worst crimes a citizen could commit was to read Goldstein's book that laid ou t in simple terms the structure of control under which the people were living. To read the book and to accept the c ontents was the ultimate thou ghtcrime. More than fifty y ears ago Orwell described the techno logy o f control such as the \"Speakwrite\", a voice recogn ition machine, and the \"Telescreen\", twoway television with only one c hannel that pou red ou t the gov ernment propaganda. We a re fast heading for that same situation today. We may"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 263 have e ndless channels, but they are basically the same one c hurning o ut the same unqu estioned g overnment line. Orwell talked o f the \"proles\" or \"proletarians\", which made up around 85 % of the Orwellian pop ulation. They were the unthink ing masses and the a uthorities look ed upon them as cattle, just as they do today. They d idn't suffer the level of surveillance of those c onsidered intellectually d angerous beca use they didn't question anything. Then there was \"prolefeed\", the brain-numbing 'entertainment'. and made-up 'news' for the masses to k eep them dumbed do wn and incapable of fr ee though t. Spot on. There was also the \"unperson\", someone removed from circulation and all files until he or she officially cea sed to exist. To talk abou t an unp erson was a though tcrime, just as to h ighlight the suffering, ind ignity and injustice imposed upon the inmates of Guantanamo Bay is considered to b e \"suppo rting the terrorists\". Anything in any publication that put the Orwellian g overnment in a bad light was described in Newspeak as \"malreported\" or \"malquoted\" beca use the authorities were never wrong . We are a lso no w seeing the Orwellian 'anti- terrorism' programm es being introduced to encourage a nd reward the pub lic to spy on eac h o ther and report their neighbours, workmates, clients and even fellow students to the a uthorities. Orwell's nightmare world is not coming, it's here. Erasing history History may not seem to b e a ll that important to control, but it is. By studying history you can compare the assumptions and v alues of the world y ou are e xperiencing. As Orwell put it: \"Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\" In fact all three a re happening together, but his point is valid in the way h istory is perceived in this reality. The Illuminati have a lways s ough t to re- write history: The destruction and removal of the unique historical treasures and texts in the museums of Iraq was part of that. One of the tasks of the Orwell character called Winston is to invent a biography o f a fictional soldier named Ogilvy, who can then b e honou red by Big Brother in a public a ddress. After writing the description o f Ogilvy's life, Winston marvels at how \"once the ac t of forgery [is] forgotten, [Ogilvy will] exist just as authentically, and u pon the same e vidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar\". It is the same principle a s faking the history o f what happened to Private Jessica Lynch o r the real story o f 9/11, By presenting a false version o f September 11 th, which is now official history, a whole series of events have taken p lace , including mass s laugh ter, beca use the people have overwhelming ly acce pted the lie. Look at American p ropaganda a bou t its own history. The people a re taugh t abou t the glorious victories and ho w their nation h as always been the bastion o f fr eedom, justice a nd morality. This fabrication colours the way many Americans view themselves and the actions of their government today. \"We don 't need telling that we are going to war to liberate Iraq and b ring freedom and justice - that's what we have been do ing since this great nation was formed.\" The true history o f the 'liberators', the United States and Britain, is one of breathtaking, grotesque, exploitation, imposition and mass murder on a scale that beggars belief. The US record on hu man rights is a disgrace a nd y et its official history emphasises its wond erful record o f giving freedom to the opp ressed. Even today, America jails five to ten times more of its people per head o f pop ulation than any o f the developed coun tries - some seven times more than China. The United Nations even removed the US from its Human Rights Committee. Such is the delusion through the faking o f US history that Texas representative, Dick Armey, gave this respon se to the UN decision: \"It reduces the United Nations to a farce when they expel the-champion o f human rights.\"41 No, it reduces you r kno wledge of you r own coun try's history to a farce to b elieve for a moment that this is the c ase. If the truth abou t America a nd Britain was in the official historical record it would b e so much more difficult to sell the lie to the people when another coun try is due to b e 'liberated' by extermination. Replacing Old speak with Newspeak is also d esigned to eventually p revent the reading o f historical acc oun ts through loss of the langu age a nd even the need to censor history will be e liminated. They manipu late the media? No. They own it! The Illuminati have been fast increasing their control of the global media by acquisition and merger, and through d estroying the opposition by d enying non -Illuminati operations the a dvertising that they also, control. This is crucial to their goal of brainwashing the popu lation through hy pnosis, Newspeak and the supp ression o f alterative views.

You also kno w that five-sense behaviour is orchestrated from the subconscious mind and n ot the conscious. This is the e xperiencer and interpreter of reality, not the prime c reator. The subconscious produ ces the though t fields, the wave patterns, and the c onscious observes them into h olographic, illusory, reality. OK . So armed with this kno wledge you target the subconscious with an explosion o f messages designed to p rogramm e its beliefs with the sense of reality that suits you. You are literally h ypnotising the pop ulation. A hypno tist wants to get you relaxed and into a trance-like state that allows powerful acc ess to the subconscious mind. He or she will then implant the messages they want you to follow w hen you think, and I emphasise think, the hypnosis is over. The story o f the man who was told not to see his daugh ter when he ca me 'out' of his hypno tic state is a good example. The human pop ulation is caugh t in the same hypno tic trance, following the c omm ands planted into the subconscious mind. This brings us back to the Reptilian conn ection. At the heart of this cond itioning, appropriately, is the most ancient part of the human b rain kno wn by scientists as the R-complex o r reptilian b rain. It is the result of our reptilian g enetic history. The Reptilians behind the Illuminati naturally k now better than anyon e how to manipulate the reptilian b rain and it is through this that humanity is largely controlled and directed. The human b rain is in two p arts, or hemispheres. We have the right brain and the left-brain that are c onn ected by a mass of nerve fibres. The left side is 'rational', 'log ical' and 'intellectual'. It works closely with the phy sical senses and can b e summ ed up by can I \"touch it\", \"see it\", \"hear it\", \"smell it\" or \"taste it\"? It comm unicates through spok en and written words. The right brain is where we manifest imagination, intuition, instincts, dream-states and the subconscious. It is the a rtist, musician and creative inspiration. It comm un icates through images and symbols, not words. This right side is closely related to the reptilian p art of the brain. Reptiles comm unicate through imagery and symbols -like the Illuminati secret society n etwork - and this makes the reptilian b rain most open to conditioning by mov ies and television. Researcher Skip Largent writes: \"All movies and television a re a p rojection o f the reptilian brain. How so? Movies and television (video games etc.) are a ll undeniably dreamlike, not only in their presentation o f symbolic-reality, but also in that humans experiencing movies, etc., have the same b rain wave pa tterns as when they are dreaming. And gue ss where d reaming originates in your head? In the reptilian b rain (although o ther parts of our brain a re involved). The 'language' of the reptilian brain is visual imagery. All comm unications transferred b y reptiles are done so b y visual symbolic representations, each h aving specific meaning.\" This is what the Illuminati are doing through their subliminals and symbolism. The movie a nd television industries are not only o wned by the Illuminati; they ov erwhelming ly created them. They und erstand ho w visual images can b e used to cond ition the pop ulation. In no rmal circumstance the reptilian-dominated right brain rece ives images through the e yes or the imagination and the left brain d ecodes those images into thou ghts and conclusions. The Illuminati have intervened in this process, however, to control human perception. Their aim is to disconnect the functions of these two d istinct parts of the brain so we c an b e manipulated through the right brain while only b eing aware of the left - or manipulated through the subconscious while only b eing aware of the conscious. They p lant images into the right brain (the dream- state, the non -conscious) using symbo lism, subliminal imagery and pictures, while often telling the left- brain ho w it should interpret those images. This is done through 'education', 'science' and the media."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 266 Television n ews does this all the time. The right brain is s hown pictures and the reporter's voice-over tells the left brain what they mean. Show me some television n ews pictures without words and I'll give you many po ssible e xplanations for what is happening. But the news reporter only tells you abou t one - invariably the one given to them by the a uthorities. The left brain is told by external sources how to d ecode right brain images. What we urgently n eed to do is regain control of our left brains and d ecide for ourselves what we a re seeing. Another aspect of the reptilian mind is the 'hive' mentality and they h ave sough t, very successfully so far, to transfer that hive or herd state to the human pop ulation. This is one reason why they are so d esperate to d estroy individuality o f all kinds. You will find that words like imagination, imagine, dream and suchlike a re used widely in advertising. They kno w that if they can u se those trigger words that encourage the right-brain, non-conscious, daydream state, they can access you r subconscious mind with imagery and then tell you r left brain how to d ecode that into conscious language - I want that car; I think the police should b e given more powers to stop crime; I need Viagra to b e a real man again; we need a world gov ernment to solve our prob lems. Television and movies are produ cing a fantasy world o f make-believe to op en up the unconscious right brain and allow the Illuminati secret access through that to the c onscious mind. Television and mov ies are packed with subliminal messages. Children are most at risk from this and they are being targeted by fantasy images to this end. In early childhood the mental state is controlled almost exclusively by the reptilian b rain and the purveyors of children's 'entertainment', like Disney, exploit this knowledge. I was also interested to find an article in the Los Angeles Times that highlighted another trait of the reptilian b rain - greed and excess. The article was headed ':Living Ever Larger; How Wretched Excess Became a Way o f Life in Southern California\". French anthropologist G. Clotaire Rapaille is quoted as saying: \" ... The desire for excess c omes from the 'reptilian b rain', the earliest, most primitive structures in our mental evolution. The reptilian wants to g rab a s much food a s possible, to be a s big and po werful as possible, because it's focussed on survival. When it comes to a choice be tween the intellect and the rep tilian, the reptilian ways wins .. \"Satisfying that inner lizard ha s its downsides. Our insatiable appetites have left Americans 9 pounds heavier, on average, than we were two decades ago , and more vulnerable than ever to he art disease and diabetes. We're racking up mountains of debt (the late fees we pa y on credit cards have more that tripled since 19 96, to $7 .3 b illion a year) and b urning up fossil fuels like crazy. We de mand things that, deep d own, we don't really want or even u se.\" 45 This is how the reptilian mind sees reality and this is the world we live in b eca use the Illuminati are reptilian. The whole focus is on survival and the Matrix consciousness has perhaps projected these sentient programs in a reptilian form beca use nothing concentrates the mind more than the fear of not surviving. We are their energy source a nd, through them, an energy source for the Matrix itself. They are seeking to control us and maintain the flow of fear energy. Their apparent arrogance is a cover for panic. What completes the c ircle is that once programm ed with an externally implanted reality, the people who h ave built their prison then p olice it to k eep the others in. Anyon e who h as another reality at odd s with the manufactured consensus is ridiculed, cond emned and generally abused for refusing to conform to the prevailing illusion. Newspeak is designed to remove e ven the langu age a vailable to d escribe a ny o ther reality, except the one the Illuminati wish to p erpetuate. Round and round we go, one programmed generation p rogramm ing. the next, eac h more e mphatically than the last. The walls close in by the day. But it doesn't have to b e like this.

These unconsciously reinforced fantasies actually threaten survival.\" Wilson Bryan Key OK , so ho w do we set ourselves free? There are many researchers of the five-sense conspiracy who b elieve the situation we face is now pretty much hop eless. It has gon e too far, I hear some of them say, and the people a re so p rogramm ed with false beliefs they will never wake up and rise up in time. If I were looking at the world pu rely from five-sense reality I would agree with them and I do think that events will need to get even more blatant before the spell is broken. But that is all it is: a spell, a hyp notic state, and that is reversible a nytime we c hoo se. The Illuminati don't orchestrate the daily assault on mind and b ody b eca use they think it's a laugh and a bit of fun. They do it in the und erstanding that consciousness in awareness of its true a nd infinite power could dismantle their manipulated reality in an instant. They are terrified that the human collective mind will wake up and remember what it has been p rogramm ed to forget. The food and' drink additives, genetically modified crops, 'medical' drugs, vacc ines, electromagnetic pollution, subliminals, 'science', 'education', media manipu lation and the supp ression o f alternative ways of healing and thinking are designed with on e aim in mind: to h ypnotise human consciousness and d isconn ect it through mind and b ody from its infinite potential: \"Loo k into my eyeeeeees.

Without the first you can't have the second . A mind in its awakened state would see through the lies before the sentence was even complete, just as we can clearly see subliminals once we a re aware of their existence. If you go b ack to p age 404 and look at the picture of the plants you'll see what I mean. The same a pplies to the manufactured illusion we ca ll the 'world', When we de-programm e a nd unp lug ou rselves from the Matrix illusion, the hypnotists s udd enly lose their power over our sense of '\" reality. What had once been, subliminal now becomes crystal clear. With this und erstanding, the Illuminati have sought to supp ress and d emonise the kno wledge of who we a re a nd the true nature of our infinite self. Those who have talked abou t the other dimensions or fr equency realms within the Matrix h ave been bu rned at the stake or, more latterly, ridiculed, cond emned and filed und er \"freaks\".

Would Israeli soldiers kill an Arab child, or anyone e lse, if they realised that they and the c hild and the tank and the gun were all the same?

But the c ontrol of those illusions comes from the subconscious beliefs that create the though t fields the c onscious mind d ecodes into its daily experience. The Illuminati and their other-dimensional masters kno w that if they can p rogramm e our subconscious beliefs they will be c ontrolling ou r five-sense illusion. That's the level at which the game is played and everything else is manifested from that. The loss of this knowledge has led to a process of perpetual self-delusion that I call \"combing. the mirror\" (Figure We first accept that the world we think we see a round u s is real and we a lso b elieve that this five- sense level of being is who we a re. Already the prison doo r is creaking shut. This delusion leads to the belief that if this world is real and we a re expressions of this world it follows that we must change the five- sense world for our experience to change. Clunk ! Gotcha! Now turn the key b efore they suss they've been had. The five-sense reality is an illusion created by ou r beliefs. If we don 't change our beliefs we ca nno t change the e xperience. That's impossible beca use one is the manifestation o f the other. We c an run around in the five-sense reality all we like, campaigning and complaining, moaning and g roaning about the state of our lives, but nothing will change. It can't. To transform our reality we need to transform our. sense of reality b eca use one c omes from the other. When we look in the mirror and we don 't like our hair style do we try to change it by combing the mirror? No, we c omb ou r hair and the mirror reflects that. Silly Is it may seem to comb a mirror to change you r hair, that is what the human race is doing. It looks through its eyes at a holographic reflection, a mirror of its s ubconscious s ense of reality, and tries to change what it doesn't like by combing the mirror - seeking to change the five-sense illusion within the five-sense illusion. To change a reflection we need to change what is being reflected - our programm ed sense of what is real. Believe small and you will reflect small. Believe no po wer and you will reflect no po wer. Believe ca n't and you will reflect can't. And v ice-versa. Billions are spending their lives thrashing around in a reflection and g etting more a nd more frightened, angry, stressed and frustrated that nothing is changing and things. ~ He. only g etting worse. But of course nothing is changing as they would wish. How can it? It's getting worse because the more frightened, angry, stressed and frustrated p eople become a t aimlessly thrashing around in a reflection, while thinking it's real, the more their mental and emotional state \"gets worse\" and must reflect in the mirror as their world \"gets worse\". It is a vicious circle that can on ly b e broken when we realise that five-sense reality is an il.1usion and we a re c reating it. We can h ave a five-sense illusion that is a prison b eca use inner prisons must become outer prisons; or we can h ave a n illusion that is a paradise. It's our choice, our decision, but whatever we choo se, the five-sense 'world' will still be a n illusion, a reflection. Nailing the norms We are c reating ou r own u niverse, one unique to u s. The more you redefine you r reality in relation to the consensus the more you will 'stand ou t' from the c rowd and b e that nail abov e the rest.

They show there is more than on e possible reality. Visionaries are dangerous people to the Illuminati and they want rid o f them. A maverick is a demon to a manipulator of consensus reality.

What is this 'normal' anyway? Who d efies it and on what basis? What is normal to on e will not be normal to another. What is genius to on e will be insanity to another. 'Norms' are only b eliefs that have solidified through repetition into un questioned acceptance. We shou ld let these rule our lives? Mum's the word The Though t Police have a vast army o f allies with which to p rogramm e a nd control the global population. 'They are called the globa l population. Consensus reality is s o all pervading in the minds of the masses that they are deluded into po licing their own p rison, and p eople c onform to the manufactured consensus because they fear the c onsequences of being different. They might ask themselves a rather important question given the c ircumstances now before us. Are they more fearful of the c onsequences of being d ifferent or those of living in a global fascist state? It is no exaggeration to say that this is the c hoice we are facing b eca use the latter is where the consensus reality is leading u s s o fast. If we are not to travel that road we must disconnect ourselves from the reality that is taking u s there. That means expressing ou r own u niqueness and refusing to b e battered into conforming to another's version o f what we should b e. The fear of expressing our uniqueness of view and lifestyle is generated from the fear of what other people think: our mothers, fathers, friends, neighbours and workmates. If you are in the public e ye there is the a dded fear of mass ridicule a nd what the media will say abou t you. But I went through all this in the ea rly 1990 s and I am still here, strong er than ever. There is nothing that we canno t achieve if we decide that nothing will stop u s. So some brain-doner journalist writes that I am m ad. So some brain-doner reader believes it and laugh s at me in the street. So? It only matters if it is my reality that it matters and it is not. Sod 'em, who cares? I am m e, I am free. Families, friends, neighbours and workmates often serve and po lice the mindprison and we need to stop conceding our uniqueness to these people. I can und erstand ho w difficult it is to do things that are at odd s with the c onsensus reality and the norms as perceived by p arents etc. We don 't want to see them upset and we would like them to b e proud o f us. Or at least most people would. But hold on h ere. Parents may choo se to p rovide the a pparent vehicle for us to experience this illusion, but they do not have the right to b e lifelong mind p rogramm ers an ~ , dictators to their offspring. Their 'children' are the same Oneness that they are. Parents and children are illusory states of the same One consciousness and each h ave a n equal right to express themselves. There needs to b e guardianship and b asic guidance in childhood, but that is different from an imposition o f belief.

But once they seek to manipulate their children to do the same they become unkno wing agents of the Matrix: \"Your mother is s o up set you want to live in a c omm une. Her heart was set on you b eing a banker/doctor/lawyer. I don 't kno w if she'll ever get over this.\" Really? Well tell her to try. How come I didn't get upset beca use she wasn't a striptease a rtist? I set my h eart on that. As always in this illusion o f duality there a re two po ints of osculation h ere, the imposer and the imposed. Both are respon sible for the supp ression- of uniqueness and freedom of though t. Anyone who seeks to impose their reality on another by whatever means is a psycholog ical fascist and servant of th ~ Matrix, but so is anyon e who concedes their uniqueness to such imposition. Step on e on the road to freedom from control is to refuse to h ave a nother tell you what to think and do with y our life. If they don 't like our choice they can do the other thing. It doesn't matter what you r parents or you r fr iends and associates say abou t you r choices. What matters is that you are you and no t what someone e lse is telling you to b e. Why should we concern ou rselves with the reactions of those who don 't even respect our right to b e who we a re? I don 't care what my children do with their lives, as long as it is what they truly want to do and they respect the freedom of others to do the same. It is their choice, not mine. If we focussed on no t allowing others to impose their will on u s and no t imposing ours on o thers, the difference to ou r lives and the world would b e fantastic. So much hu man potential is locked away b ehind the barrier marked: \"What would p eople say if I said o r did this?\" Let it go and let it flow. Just do it!!! Yes, you might see old 'friends' drift away and a whole host of new ones appear. So? Great. Master of illusion An illusion can on ly control you when you think it is real. Once you recogn ise that you r five-sense reality is an illusion it imm ediately loses s o much o f its power over you . You still hurt your toe if you b ang it on the table leg even though the table a nd you r toe a re only h olograms. To kno w intellectually it is an illusion is not to k now it on a level deep enough to disconn ect you from it and there is s till the c onsensus reality, the collective mind, broadcasting the belief that it is real. You can also still get pulled into Matrix thought and reactions after you h ave recogn ised the illusion. I have heard this called \"having a 3-D moment\". \"How dare you say that tome? ... I'm going to ... \" Stop!! Deep b reath. Three-D moment. It's an illusion remember? Yeah, shit, what was I thinking? OK , I'm fine a gain no w. Phew! Naturally this happens as you b egin to unplug, but the c ontrol the Matrix h as over you starts to d iminish. I have found that if you k eep telling you rself it is all an illusion, a dream world, you b egin to 'see' that fact with ever increasing clarity. Another thing I have found interesting is to b e c onsciously aware that you are seeing from you r brain and no t your eyes. It is a c ase of recogn ising that what you think you are seeing is happening in the visual cortex in the brain and no t in you r eyes. I don 't kno w w hat others may experience when they do this, but the world seems very d ifferent to me. As the process of unp lugging continues, things that mattered to you b efore become less important and your outlook on life a nd you rself starts to transform. You b ecome more tolerant of you rself and o thers. When you see it's an illusion and we a re a ll the same Oneness creating ou r experience, what is there to g et worked up abou t? The only time I am interested in what other people do is when they are imposing their will on others, as the Illuminati are on the rest of us. Short of that what people do is entirely up to them and it's non e of my bu siness. Your attitudes to everything change once the recogn ition o f the illusion goes deeper and d eeper and you start to be that awareness rather than just intellectually accept its existence. Don't think it, know it. Don't try to do it, just do it. These a re very d ifferent states of being; When, you b ecome more consciously aware of the illusion, you can b egin to enjoy it withou t it all the hang up s .that imprison u s when we think it is real. We ca n h ave fun and \"express our desires, as long as they don 't impinge on the freedom of others. My ou tlook is that I will try anything I fancy and if I don 't like it I won't do it again. If I do like it I will do it as often as I like. The Matrix illusion u ses fear and gu ilt to h old u s in its grasp, If we have a n experience we don 't like or wish we had no t don e, the guilt and trauma ca n stay with u s for a lifetime e ffecting ou r every reaction.

We might wake up feeling fearful and shocked n <?w and again b eca use the dream seemed so real, but soon the feeling is gon e a nd we can even laugh abou t it. \"It was only a dream\", we say.

We can remove its control by not only seeing, but"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 274 living the fact that this is only a dream that we a re creating. 'Death' is only the a wakening from a dream and nothing to fear. Seeing through the mirror When we observe our daily experience we are looking at a mirror of ourselves. It is a mirror of our belief in what is real. It's no good u s blaming anyone e lse for what we don 't like in ou r lives, the respon sibilit y is ours. Taking that respon sibility and cea sing to blame others - or ourselves come to that - is to take a massive step on the freedom road. The power the Illuminati use to control and manipu late us is only the power we give a way to them and o thers every d ay. The most destructive e xpression o f this is blaming o thers for our plight. To do that is to accept that others have power over our lives and the reality we c reate. In truth, only we have that power if we c hoo se to u se it; but if we believe that others are in control of our destiny we., will create that reality. The Illuminati are not the only on es respon sible for the world as it is. How could they be? There a re only a relative handful of them working in awareness of the goal. A few manipulate a nd billi ons allow themselves to b e manipulated. Where does the real respon sibility lie? We c an't be c ontrolled unless we a llow ourselves to b e and, crucially, insist that others do the same. Divide a nd rule is the bottom line of all dictatorships and th ~ human race has conceded to that on a mega scale. Arab is turned against Jew, black against white, Right against Left, in the way the Matrix must operate to maintain its control by duality and division. Unplugging from the Matrix means refusing to recognise these illusory fault lines. We are a ll One. I refuse to see a Jew as different from an Arab and v ice versa. They are both expressions of the One a nd n eed to b e observed and treated the same, non e more or less important than the other. I refuse to see black p eople in terms that I would no t see white, nor to see the 'Left' as I would not see the 'Right'. How could it be a ny different, except when we believe the illusion o f division is real? If we do that, the Matrix has us. It promotes the illusion o f division and du ality and if we accept that, the trap is triggered. There is no way ou t 'of an' illusion b ased on d ivision if we buy the belief that the division is real. Ditching doublethink Everyon e e lse's freedom is our fr eedom. If one person do es not enjoy the freedom of all others then non e are free. Once again, how can they b e? A little bit of fr eedom is no freedom. This is a simple truth that the robo t radicals of the Left and the robo t righteous at the other polarity canno t seem to g rasp. Freedom of speec h is not only the freedom for others to say what is acceptable to u s. That is tyranny . It is the freedom to express you r though ts, no matter how much we may no t agree with !hem. A truly free society (and those who b elieve in freedom rather than u sing it as· a weapon o f coercion) would campaign as fiercely for the freedom of people with whom they disagree a s they would for those they suppo rt. But what happens? The oppo site. The leadership, and I emphasise the leadership, of the British and Canadian Green Parties have campaigned to stop me speaking in pu blic. The British Green Party b anned me from speaking at their conference years ago, despite a n inv itation from m embers, beca use I was saying things abou t reality and the nature of life that they thou ght would lead to them being ridiculed. The 'Anti-Nazi' League in Britain organised p rotests at some of my events years ago when, iron ically, I have been warning o f the rise of the Fourth Reich (or the overt re-emergence of the Third) since the early 19 90s. Yet ask any o f these people what they think about freedom of expression and they will say it is a fund amental human right. What an example of Orwell's dou blethink, the a bility to h old two contradictory views and b elieve both to b e true. It is possible to encompass the a pparent paradox es of life in that the same e vent can look v ery different from different points of observation and all can b e true from the perspective of the observer. But that is not the same a s doub lethink. Either you b elieve in freedom of speec h o r you don 't. Freedom of speech for one, but supp ression for those you don't like is not freedom of speec h. Anyon e who seeks to p revent the free expression o f thought by anyone e lse is an agent of control and they should k now that before their self- delusion leads to the very fascist Orwellian state they claim to oppo se. Orwell must be squirming at the antics of those people. We need to start focussing on the right to freedom' of expression b eca use what is happening - and what the robo t radicals are seeking to enforce - is the same a s what occurred in Nazi Germany. Book s unacce ptable to the Nazi Party were banned and bu rned; those who tried to speak ou t against the Nazis had their public meetings banned o r disrupted; others were jailed and killed for their views. This is happening today and the robo t radicals are often the vehicle through which it is don e.

So what's the problem? It is not a matter of agreeing o r not agreeing; it is abou t the right to express ones though ts like e veryon e e lse.

Doublethink, doublethink, doub lethink. It is terminal (for fr eedom) self-indu lgence. I hear people a sk abou t those who would u se their fr eedom of speec h to call for violence a gainst others or encourage sexual acts with children. But wouldn't you rather have such people in the open where they can be seen and identified than h ave them doing exactly the same in secret? Why is it fine for George Bush, Tony Blair and Co to call by the hou r for violence a gainst Iraq, Afghanistan and a long list of others to come, and y et it is not fine for others to do the same on a much lesser scale of potential slaughter? It is dou blethink and d ouble standards. If one is illegal, so should b e the other, or rather t' other way round . If someone is calling for violence a gainst others or the a buse of children I want to kno w abou t it, not have it go on b ehind the scenes unexpo sed where nothing can b e don e. This is what happens when you supp ress freedom of expression, you pu sh it und erground where it festers and o ften p rospers beyond ou r awareness. Let's have it out in the open where we c an d eal with it and know w hat we a re dealing with. If you see someone suppo rting sex with children, you kno w to k eep you r children well away from him. If such v iews canno t be e xpressed ho w w ould you k now to p rotect you r kids from him or her? Laws to d efend freedom, the freedom not to b e murdered, abused and subjected to violence e tc., are one thing. Laws to curtail freedom of expression are quite a nother. We only n eed on e 'law': do what you like, but don't do it by removing the freedom of others. If you think about it , no o ther law is nece ssary and it can b e filed u nder a simple heading - the Law of Respect. To pu rge ourselves of the Matrix mentality we need to b e aware of our own doub lethink. This is almost a barometer of our sense of disconn ection b eca use the more we become aware of reality the less dou blethink we manifest. Doub lethink is largely the produ ct of prejudice a nd rigid b elief beca use this colours our judgement of everything. When America a ttacks another coun try in the name of liberation while killing thou sands of civilians and wreaking u tter devastation, the ac ceptance that \"liberation\" and \"mass s laugh ter\" can bo th b e true c omes from (a) the bias most Americans have towards America a nd (b) the belief that their nation is the global home of fr eedom and justice. Once you see e verything as One, there is no 'America' or 'Iraq' and there. is no b ias to on e or the other. Your only measurement is freedom, fairness and justice for all in any given circumstances. You can see how the politicians prepare the people to encompass the dou blethink. George Bush's s peechwriters have had h im say: \"See, we love - we love freedom. That's what they didn't understand. They hate things; we love things. They act out of hatred; we d on't seek revenge: we seek justice ou t of' love . \"You ne ed to tell your loved o nes, the little one s in pa rticular, that when they hear the p resident talking about al-Qaeda , Iraq and o ther places, I do so because I long for peace. \"I want to send the signal to ou r ene my that you ha ve aroused a compassiona te and de cent and mighty nation, and we're going to hun t you down.\" Orwell could h ave written that. Such non sense is designed to p repare the people to accept the dou blethink: love is killing; mass murder of the inno cent is not revenge, it is justice a nd love; endless war is a longing for peace. The reference to a \"compassionate a nd d ecent and mighty n ation\" is there to make the people feel good about themselves and \"mighty\" through the weapon s of destruction wielded by the troop s that will kill thou sands in their name. It is the old John Wayne mentality that is leading v ast tracts of the American psyche like a lamb to the slaugh ter hou se. The dou blethink trap is to give the people the c hoice between the belief they are loving, compassionate, dece nt and mighty o r that their gov ernment is guilty o f mass murder and imperial conqu est. They want to b elieve the first is true, but they are faced with the fact that their troop s have invaded another nation and are killing its civilians (although the scale of this is s upp ressed).

These labels are illusions and why shou ld we be biased in ou r perception o f fairness and justice by favou ring one expression o f the One a gainst another? The murder of a c hild in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Palestine is no more or less important than the murder of a c hild in New Y ork o r Tel Aviv. We are in this together and we need to g row up and realise we a re all the same. United States of Amnesia  The United States is the spiritual home of dou blethink and self-dece ption. It is an Orwellian society that thinks it is the freest coun try in the world and h as the right to impose the same Orwellian 'freedom' on everyon e e lse. Individually they are overwhelmingly lovely p eople, but, as I have said b efore, there is a level of the American collective psyche that is forever John Wayne. Or, as Tom Foley, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, put it: \"Ind ividually, we a re reasonably modest, but collectively, we have been told again and again that we are the greatest thing in the history o f the world.\"2 The former head o f the CIA, Admiral Stansfield Turner, said that if anyon e says the United States is not fit to b e a n imperial power the burden is on them to say why. Well, as this book h as s hown, that doesn't take long . His reasons for why the US is fit to run an empire a re revealing o f the American collective psyche. They \"won\" the Cold War (what has that got to do with it?); they are the most democratic c oun try in the world (with an un elected president); they are the best 'example of \"free e nterprise\" (controlled by a ca rtel of corporations that destroy free enterprise ac ross the globe); and the world n eeds a leader and no on e e lse ca n do it (it doesn't).3 Turner conceded that America knew little a bou t the world it was intending to \"lead\" (control), but \"we believe ours is the right way\".4 His words betray an arrogance and igno rance (the two invariably go together) that you find with Bush-suppo rting Americans. One lady, Bea Kristol from Washington, was interviewed by the UK Daily Telegraph abou t American imperialism and was puzzled and shocked by the very sugg estion : \"But the word 'imperial' implies that there is s omething in it for America.\" 5 Yep, she really said that and no doub t believed it. Taking ov er Ir aqi oil and h anding ou t fantastic c ontracts to US companies to rebuild what the US invasion had d estroyed do es not imply there is s omething in it for America e ven on that level? Doublethink. Robert Joss, the Dean o f Stanford Business Schoo l, said that Americans (though not all by any means) genuinely feel they are \"trying to b ring go odness to everybody else\".6 Tom Foley said Americans had a \"very p ervasive notion o f our good intentions\". This led to an assumption that \"any sort of objective examination o f the United States must result in approval, if not vigorous. applause\".? Michael Ignatieff, director of the Carr centre in the Kennedy Schoo l of Government at Harvard, gave this excellent summ ary of why Americans are so easy to manipulate: \"There is nothing more frightening than American inno cence. It's a fearsome, sometimes murderous inno cence. Our inability to question ou r own motives is truly alarming.\" 8 Failing to qu estion motives is essential to doublethink. Ignatieff said that America was controlled by an ideology, \"but li ke a ll ideologies, it doesn't believe it is one. It just believes that it is the Truth.\" 9 America's ideology b elieves it is fine to spend hund reds of billions a year on weapon s of mass destruction while 43 milli on Americans can't afford h ealth insurance. Doub lethink again. But Orwellian mind-control in America is s o po werful and all-pervading that you can und erstand ho w this mentality is formed. Schoolchildren are told every d ay to face the US flag and say: I pledge a llegiance to the flag o f the United States of America ... one nation u nder God, indivisible a nd with liberty and justice for all. \"I have my three- year-olds doing it\", said Teresa ~ . West, head teacher of the Glen Forest elementary schoo l in Falls Church, Virginia. to Wanda Nelson, deputy h ead o f Lake Anne School-in Reston, said: \"We do it at 8.25 every morning. If one of the c hildren comes late with their parents and the pledge is anno unced ov er the loudspeakers, they stop d ead in their tracks and say it right there, children and p arents alike.\" 11 When she was told that we don 't even h ave flags in British schools, she was shocked. \"You h ave no flags? How on earth do you engender patriotism?\" What she ca n't seem to g rasp is that patriotism should not need to b e engendered. Only false, blind, patriotism needs that. It should come without pressure from a pride in the dece ncy and sense of justice a c oun try truly stands for and no t through the brainwashing o f a lie. One British couple who moved to the US told the Daily Telegraph that only a month at an American schoo l their children were c oming h ome singing p atriotic song s.

This, I'm afraid, is an ignorant and a rrogant nation.\" 12 All these reactions are straight from the pages of 1984 . I have been saying for some years that the United States was created as a mind-control experiment, ultimately controlled from Europe a nd it is clearly working. It is beca use the people see everything as 'parts', like 'Americans' and 'Afghans' or 'Iraqis' that the attitudes expressed abov e a re possible. Only with an und erstanding o f Oneness can the c onflict and injustice wane. Fortunately there a re tens of millions of Americans and g rowing - who do no t fall for the doublethink promoted by their government and it is through them that the c hange is coming. Hypocritic oaths It is worth b eing aware of our respon ses to p eople a nd events and to constantly scan ou r views for dou blethink, as well as the statements of the politicians and manipu lators. This is especially the ca se with those who ho ld strong p olitical or religious views. They are fodd er for doub lethink. Christian dou blethinkers s uppo rt war and ask God to bless the troop s doing the killi ng while c laiming to serve Jesus, the \"Prince of Peace\". Religion and p olitics are the headqu arters of doub lethink. Over thou sands of years, religion h as brilliantly served the structure for human control. They h ave indo ctrinated the pop ulous with prison-of-the-mind b elief systems that shou ld n ever be questioned. They h ave imposed those beliefs through fear, indoctrination, isolation and the a ttempted g enocide of non -believers. They. have fough t each other. for dominance of the human mind, producing an explosion o f opportunity for the Illuminati to divide and rule for millennia. The major religions have their origin in the very region o f the world, the Near and Midd le East, from whence so much o f the Illuminati network emerged. More coincidence? Not a c hance. Religions are c reations of dualism and division. They p romote the dualities of good and evil, God and the people, and while they say \"God is everywhere\", what are really saying is that 'He' is only interested in an exclusive c ontract based on b elieving what the men-in-frocks tell you to b elieve. They say they suppo rt \"right\" against \"wrong\", but then, when it suits them, they d ecide that 'right' and \"wrong \" are the same. They quo te Jesus as saying \"turn the other cheek\", but then b ack wars of conqu est, murder and robb ery. Again, here is the prejudice necessary for doub lethink. These are wars against Muslim coun tries, the non - believers, and surely this is a case of onward Christian soldiers? The war is s erving the desires of 'Jesus', this doublethink go es, beca use it is ridding the world o f a religion that is in competition with their own corporate brand. Also the US president is a Satanic ... er, sorry, Christian, believer and h e is s erving the cause of Jesus. Extreme Islamic fanatics (far fewer in nu mber than the propaganda c laims), believe that they need to rid the world o f the Christian and Jewish non -believers and they suppo rt violence a gainst them in the name of serving the ca use of their religion. Round and round and round. Former House of Representatives Speaker, Tom Foley, talked o f the power that religion h as over the American mind: \"We a re no t a nation which prays in the closet. We e xpect the Presiden t to be our principle p reacher; to express c onstantly the idea that God ha s s howered u s with special blessings and that we, therefore; have a special iden tity, a special mission in the world. It is a mission which is realised in part by just being who we are, but which a lso requires us to en courage o thers to be just like u s.\" 13 "},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" 278 This \"encouragement\" includes dropping bo mbs on p eople.

Watching the words There is a simple 'rule' for seeing through the Newspeak and dou blethink o f politicians and their ilk. It is this: whatever they say they mean the oppo site; whatever they claim, the oppo site is true. \"Will\" means \"won't\" and \"won't\" means \"will\"; ~ 'I do\" means\"1 don't\" and \"1 don't\" means \"1 d o\"; \"1 b elieve in p eace \" means \"1 b elieve in war\"; \"It has not been d ecided\" means that it has; \"It has been d ecided\" means that it hasn't; \"Conflict is not inevitable\" means that it is; \" So and so coun try is dangerous to the world\" means it is no threat to anyon e; \"I never had sexual relations with that woman\" means ... well, you kno w w hat it means. The Illuminati have a n entire spok en and symbolic language on meaning reversal. Writer Michael Ellner described the society that such reversal creates: \"Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy h ealth, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy kno wledge, gov ernments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality.\" Watch the political and military leaders and you will realise that seeing through them really is very straightforward. Most of the time there is no n eed even to read b etween the lines; just reverse the a pparent meaning o f the statement. If we observe the 'news' programm es and po litical outpourings of propaganda from this perspective these one-time instruments of persuasion are imm ediately n eutered. When you u se this technique it can b e frustrating to see the scale of the daily lies that people like Bush, Blair and their cronies are prepared to tell, but it can also b e funny b eca use they're pathetic really. Most importantly, by reversing their statements they are telling y ou what they are planning to do o r what they are saying really means. Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, said that the latest superstate c onstitution o f the European Union \" does not sign ificantly change the relationship b etween the EU and its member sovereign n ations\". Once more the reverse is true. George Bush said the gov ernment \"has taken unp recedented measures to d efend ou r homeland and, more importantly, we will continue to hun t the e nemy do wn b efore he can strike\". This means they h ave taken unp rece dented measures to impose c ontrol of American citizens and will continue to invade a nd conqu er any coun try they choo se e ven though that coun try h as not attacked anyon e\". The principle of meaning reversal and n on-specific blandn ess applies to all Newspeak. Reverse the apparent meaning and y ou see the real meaning. Remember, too, that the line pushed by the mainstream m edia a bou t a person o r event has originated almost every time from gov ernments and their spinners and is aimed at getting you to acce pt their version o f the story. Political incorrectness The other point with regard to language is s imply to d efend it from extinction as we kno w it. We need to ensure that Oldspeak is not replace d inexorably by the smoke and-mirrors of Newspeak that already comprises today's political vocabulary. This means using the language a nd refusing to bo w to the Gulag agents of political correctness or 'PC'. \"You can't use those words\" = you watch me, darlin'. If we refuse to use the ludicrous language of the PC Plods (oop s, reference to the policeman in the Noddy children's s tories with its character called 'Big Ears' that might be seen as a slight against those with v ertically endo wed hearing d evices). I'll try again. If we refuse to u se the ludicrous language of the PC Plods there is nothing they can do , just as if everyon e refused to p ay street parking' fines, the system would collapse.

More e scapology As we have seen, our minds are being assaulted with subliminals to p rogramm e. our reality. But research has found that even if you can't actually see subliminal messages their effectiveness is dramatically reduced when you are a ware they are there. It is worth no ting to y ourself when you read a paper or magazine, watch television o r even walk do wn the street that you kno w you are receiving subliminal and symbolic messages, but you reject them. You can consciously place mental barriers in y our subconscious by visualising a shield, or whatever form you want the barrier to take, blocking the subliminals. Visualisation is simply a way o f focussing the mind on what\" you wish to repel and you can then do so withou t needing to constantly think abou t it. You are using the power of you r mind to block the influence of the subliminals, which d epend on people being unaware of them. Bringing the hidden into conscious awareness dilutes its power, as, again, we ca n see with the e xample of the 'sex' in the picture of the plants. Aw areness is the key. Subliminal techniques are the e xploitation o f human d enial. We don 't see what our denial does not want to see. For this and o ther reasons it is good to b e hon est abou t what we are denying about ourselves. We are a ll in d enial of something and while it is there it eats away at us affecting u s mentally a nd emotionally from beyond the c onscious threshold. We a re what we a re, all glorious expressions of th ~ same Infinite One. What are you h iding from yourself abou t yourself? What am I? True freedom demands that we find ou t, be hon est with ou rselves, and let the denial go. With the denial eliminated, often the desire a lso go es. I have a fetish for being whipped with a garden ho se. There, said it, it's out now, I feel so much b etter. Actually, that's not true (it's really a rubb er thong ). No, no, shut up Icke, while you 're still ahead. The point is though, that if I did g et a thrill, from a garden ho se, so the hell what? Would I be hurting anyone, other than myself, by free c hoice? Would it mean I was a bad p erson o r my work would b e less credible? No, it would no t. Then, why the denial? Answer: \"The fear of what others would think\" - the bottom line reason for denial of self. This does not only apply to sexual themes. People deny that they are frightened o r lack confidence a nd they erect 'front personalities' that appear to exud e c ourage a nd self esteem, to h ide the reality o f how they really feel. These hidden insecurities can then b e e xploited. There is nothing wrong with feeling fear or lacking self esteem. They are potential manifestations of the One, when in a state of illusory disconn ection. Face them and they can b e dealt with. Deny them and you g ive them power over you and you r ability to see through the illusion. We canno t be hon est with o thers until we a re hon est with ou rselves and it is our lack o f self-honesty that the manipulators s o exploit. You're a failure? Oh yeah? W ho says? Insecurity is one of the manipulators' prime weapon s. They g ive us 'role models' in every walk o f life to whom we a re suppo sed to aspire a nd against whom we are e ncouraged to judg e our own 'success'. Ladies, look at these rich and famous actresses and models, aren't they just sensational? Oops, you don 't look like them do you ? What a shame. But don 't despair.

To ho ld u s in the illusion the symbols of succe ss are all related to the five-senses and this is where insecurity comes in.

To elicit this reac tion they h ave to 'succeed' in the terms the people a round them have been cond itioned to p erceive a s s uccess - big car, big hou se, lots of money in the bank. This is the whole basis of the' American: Dream' that has held that nation's collective mind in slavery for centuries. When you don 't 'succee d' in these terms (and the vast majority can't because the system is rigged for the few) they are c onsidered, and o ften consider themselves, a failure. This lack o f self-esteem can then be further exploited and the 'losers' are held up as an example of what happens if you don 't keep chasing the 'dream'. The whole insane system depends in its entirety on consumption and the c onstant expansion o f consumption; people a re pressured and enticed to consume more with every y ear and to consider the amoun t they consume a s a measurement of their 'success'. The obsession to 'succee d' in this way leads to people borrowing more a nd more money to p rov ide the trinkets that display their alleged 'succe ss' while they spend their lives in p erpetual terror of not being able to meet the repayments.

Albert Einstein In the first Matrix movie, Neo (\"The One\"), overcame' death' and transformed h is awareness beyond the illusion in a hotel called the 'Heart 0' the City'. This was clearly no coincidence in such a symbolic produ ction. It is through the heart that we conn ect with the Oneness of all and see through the veil of illusion, the veil of fears. I talk abou t us being disconn ected from Oneness, but I only u se that term to k eep it simple. In fact we are not disconn ected at all. We ca n't be because the Oh-e is always the One. To pu t it more acc urately, we have fallen for the illusion o f disconnection, duality and p olarity, and as s uch we create the holographic appearance of disconn ection. We do no t need to b e reconn ected, we simply h ave to realise that we were never disconn ected. The sense of division is an indoctrinated illusion. The a pparent experience of disconnection comes when we c lose our heart chakra, our direct link to Oneness, and b ecome mesmerised by the illusory world o f the 'head', the mind. The heart chakra or vortex is the balance point for the other six major chakras and that is an expression o f Oneness: the balance of all (Figu re 64, overleaf)· That is what 'love' is: the balance of all. Balance - Oneness in awareness of itself - does not have polarities between which to vibrate. One ca nno t oscillate with One beca use there can b e only on e 'One'. As I experienced myself in the Amazon, Oneness does not vibrate; it is s till. Thus, spiritual people talk abou t the still ness of the heart. They are speaking o f the stillness of Oneness that we e xpress through the heart vortex. What do we say when we see the troub les of the world'? \"It makes my h eart ache\" and \"It breaks my h eart\". These feelings relate to Oneness observing the illusion through the heart and ou r empathy with another expression of the One suffering the c onsequences of illusory disconn ection. My h eart aches because I kno w it does not have to b e like this and I kno w how it could b e if we would o nly remove the c hains that bind u s to illusion. If we experience the world through the heart and no t the head, our whole reality is transformed., Instead o f 'think ing' what to do , we feel it, or know it in the heart; t he place from where you feel love or where you feel you r heart ache. This is our conn ection with the One in ou r Matrix state a nd the Illuminati seek constantly to close the heart vortex through events that trigger fear, resentment and a desire for revenge .. The whole global econo mic system is designed to this end - to g enerate c ompetition and conflict that divides the sense of One; and to create a daily cycle of stress that comes from chasing the material 'dream' and illusory 'success', or seeking to survive on the scraps that are left for those cast aside in the stampede for the pig trough . It is harder to op en you r heart when you h ate the guy in the job that you want or when there is far more week than wages. To g enerate the e nergy o f fear on which their masters depend, the Illuminati have to close the heart chakra; for only then will we be dominated by the e motional states that the heart kno ws are only illusions of mind. Energy flows where a ttention goes, as they say, and we a re pressured to focus our attention on fear, resentment, revenge a nd survival. Frustration is a massive heart supp ressor. It is no surprise that studies have revealed ho w those who score high in ho stility and aggression are seven times more likely to die of a heart attack than those who score low.! These emotions s upp ress the heart chakra and reduce the flow of energy. This creates a compressed field o f energy that manifests through the phy sical heart as a heart attack. There you h ave the basis on which stress causes heart disease. 'But if we do no t concede our reality to these manipu lated emotions, we rise a bov e them and they no longer dictate our health o r how w e see ourselves and o thers. When we feel and kno w from our heart we find empathy with all other expressions of the One. The heart does not identify with b eing American o r British or Jewish o r Arab. It identifies only with Oneness, balance, fairness and justice for all. It does what it believes to b e right, no matter what or who is involved. Those who manipu late the John Wayne mentality in America to g lean suppo rt for their wars of conqu est would h ave no chance if they were speaking to open hearts.

The head b elieves that it is American o r British, Arab o r Jew. It sees only the parts, not the whole. It believes in light and d ark, left and right, good and evil; and such entrenched b elief creates this illusory duality. It edits what it ~ sees' to confirm its beliefs and it sees what it is told to see. One example of this is the belief in God Bless America, Land o f the Free, fulfilling its God- given d estiny to b ring' peace a nd justice to the world by p romoting violence a nd injustice. All ideology is the Matrix at work. Ideology is the illusion that there is only on e way and its advo cates are the z ealots that seek, in their arrogant self obsession, to impose their beliefs on o thers. How can there be only on e way when you are dealing with infinity? There ca n on ly b e infinite ways because the Infinite is all possibility. Wisdom is diversity; ideology is, well, bloody stup id. Wilson Bryan Key writes: \"The moment anyone a ccepts an objective reality, an e ternal truth, they have become vulnerable, manipulable, and e minently exploitable.

The intuitive become the guide that leads us through the maze of manipu lation that entraps the head in illusion it believes to b e real. Seeing is not believing; not even feeling is believing; knowing is believing, or rather kno wing is kno wing. Belief is an illusion o f mind. As we surrender to the heart, the head b egins to view reality from another, greater, perspective. In do ing so, it becomes One with the heart and what we think and feel are the same because they come together and know. When they do , it is Krmistice Day for the soul; the war is over. The inner peace becomes outer peace because the two are but one. The c onflict in the world 'outside' is only a mirror of the war within u s all. If we make peace with ourselves, we make peace with life itself, for we a re life itself. When we do this, the Illuminati will be no more beca use they will be e rased from our sense of reality every bit as much as the man who could not see his daughter. The Illuminati are a lso illusions of our minds, as is the brain that they seek to p rogramm e. Even ou r minds beyond the brain are illusions. So is the heart chakra, albeit a higher level one. It is but a stepping stone to true, all-embracing Oneness, where there is no h eart or soul or head; only the balance of everything, the All Knowing, which simply 'is'. An illusion (mind) is creating an illusion (reality). The Oneness of all is the only truth, everything else is illusion. The mystic, Sri Aurobindo Ghose, brilliantly described the a ntidote to all this: \"We must not only c ut asunde r the snare o f the mind and the senses, but flee a lso from the snare o f ~ e thinker, the snare of the theologian and the church-builder, the meshes of the Word a nd the bondage of the Idea. All these a re within u s waiting to wall in the spirit with form; but we must always go beyond, always renounce the lesser for the g reater, the finite for. the Infinite; we must be prepared to proceed from illumination to illumination, from experien ce to e xperience, from soul state to soul state ... Nor must we attach ou rselves even to the truth we hold most securely, for they are bu t forms and e xpressions of the Ineffable who refuses to limit itself to an y form or expression.\" 3 We are not our bod ies. We a re not our brains. We are not our minds. We a re not even ou r though ts. We a re the silence, the still ness, between them. Even as we think we a re purveyors of illusion. We live in a world that is designed to b e neither silent nor still. There a re keepers at every g ate to the One. We are kept busy, busy, busy, to maintain the c hatter of mind. The development of cities concentrates people a nd stress, movement and n oise. Where is the silent? Where is the still? They are within u s and that is where we must go to experience the One. It is worth making space e very d ay to calm the mind and go into the silence a nd stillness where kno wing is waiting to communicate. Sri Aurobindo said: \"To discover the new coun try within u s, we have to leave the old on e behind.\" Meditation is one way o f achieving this, although I prefer to call it sitting qu ietly. There is a lot of junk talked abou t meditation and this method o r that. I have met many meditation addicts who are no more e nlightened than those who n ever do it. I have met a lot of psychoactive drug junkies in a similar state. It is not the meditation o r the drugs; it is where you allow them to take you o r, more to the point, where you allow you to take you rself. Sitting qu ietly, for me a nyway, is to surrender to you r heart and allow it to take you h ome. If you h ave never don e this, it can b e frustrating trying to stop the c hatterbox in the head. So don 't try. By do ing so y ou are giving it power through attention. Don't try to do anything, just be. This removes the power fr om the mind and with repetition you will find that the c hatter will subside a nd you can go into timeless, Oneness states, where there a re no qu estions, nor even words; there is only kno wing, being.\"\" It is like taking a deep b reath, stepping b ack and looking at life from another perspective. What you b elieved to b e so important becomes ever more irrelevant as the divisions melt away and un ity is all that remains. Within the realm of illusion, visualisation is concentrated though t (like \"prayer'!')and thoug ht creates holographic reality. Visualising what you want to create in h olographic e xperience ca n b e e xtremely effective in the manifestation o f what you d esire. Through this we can experience whatever we c hoo se - pleasant or unpleasant, a nightmare or our wildest dream. Our beliefs decide the e xperience. A television psychic from m y childhood u sed to say: \"Think lucky and you 'll be lucky.\" But it is nothing to do with luck; it is manifestation o f reality by sense of reality. If we kno w w e a re Oneness and the rest is illusion, we ca n enjoy the holographic 'world' and h ave fun with it. We ca n experience a ll that is available to u s - anything. Life is not an \"either or\", it is an \"as well as\". Our limitations are only ou r sense of limitation. Illusion can only control us when we think it is real, just as a magician canno t fool us when we kno w how he does it. From the kno wledge of Oneness and the manifestation o f 'reality' through thought, we ca n create a n illusion that we like in the full knowledge that this is whatever we a re doing. By freeing the mind o f fear, doub t and a sense of limitation, we ca n live' in an illusory p aradise in the kno wledge that we are paradise - the One.

But love is Oneness and so love is the balance of all things. Hatred comes from the illusion o f division. Hate is not the other polarity o f love beca use love is Oneness and Oneness has no polarities. If we hate those who cause the mayhem we a re holding ou rselves in the illusion and, therefore, the c ontrol of those we hate. This is yet another loop . The manipulators are full of hate a nd fear; so do we want to join them?? To love someone is not to stand by and let them impose their will upon y ou o r others. Love stands up for what it believes to b e right no matter what the challenge or intimidation. It is possible to expo se what is going on and change that reality without hating those involved.

Friedrich Nietzsche put it like this: \"He who fights with monsters might take care; lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss , the ab yss gazes also into You.\" How often do we see those who challenge \"evil\" turn into a mirror of those they cond emn? Look at the political Left and Right as one prime e xample. The far Left hates the far Right and vice versa. Yet they are the same in bo th thought and method. Hatred, resentment and a need for revenge a re cancers of the soul. When we feel these e motions, who are the victims? We a re. The targets might be having a great time, unaware of how we feel abou t them, while we c ook in our own stew of seething fury at the e xpense of joy and h appiness. Hatred and resentment are, with fear, the ultimate in self abuse. It's time to let them go and see them for the illusions that they are. We don 't need to fight the Illuminati, but change the reality in which they exist. Scientist\" and p hilosopher Buckminster Fuller said: \"You n ever change things by fighting the existing reality.

But this is, in fact, the final card o f a gambler who forgot the golden rule: don't play with those w):1o kno w more than you do. The Illuminati plays Oneness = four threes plays a full house. The a wakening is challenging the domination o f Illuminati reality in the c ollective unconscious - consensus reality. The 'hund red monkeys' are poo ling their realisations on the human 'Worldwide Web' and there they can b e a ccessed by anyon e a ttuning to that awareness. This is happening at an ever quickening p ace . It can b e seen in the millions on the streets in p rotest at the invasion o f Ir aq - many of whom had n ever don e a nything like that before. It can b e seen in their articulated und erstanding that those in authority are pedalling lies to sell a secret agenda to the people. It can b e seen in the e mpathy with those of other skins and o ther cultures who face the violence of the so-called civilised world. The hund redth monk ey syndrome means that people a re spon taneously awakening with a kno wing that something is seriously no t right with the direction they are being taken.

The government and 'legal' system of the United States is controlled b y the 'Crown'. As explained in chapter two, the Crown is not the British monarch as widely believed, b ut the 'City', an independent state in Londo n. In turn, the 'City' or the 'Crown' is really the Knights Templar Church, also known as the Crown Temple or Crown Templar, and this is located between Fleet Street and Victoria Embankment. The Temple ground s are also home to the Crown Offices at Crown Office Row. The Crown Temple controls the global 'legal' system, including those in the United States and Canada, because all Bar Associations are franchises of the . ~ - International Bar Association at the Inns of Court at Crown Temple based at Chancery Lane in Londo n. All Bar Association)' are franchises of the Crown and all Bar Attorneys throughou t the world p ledge a solemn o ath to the Temple, even thou gh some may not be aware that this is what they are doing. Bar Association 'licensed' Attorneys must keep to their oath, p ledge and terms of allegiance to the Crown Temple if they are to be \"called to Bar\" and work in the 'legal' profession. The 'ruling' monarch is also subordinate to the Crown Temple a nd h as been so since the reign o f King John in the 13th century when royal sovereignty was transferred to the Crown Temple a nd, through that, to the Roman Church. King John (11671216 ) is a key to this story. It was at .the Chancel, or Chancery, of the Crown Inner Temple Court in January 1215 that King John was faced with the demands of the English barons to confirm the rights enshrined in the Magna Carta. When h e signed the Magna Carta in 1 215 h istory records this as an event that extended hu man freedom, bu t the real affect was very different as we \"shall see. The 'governments' of the United States and Canada a re other subsidiaries of the Crown Temple and so is the US 'central bank', the Federal Reserve. Indeed the global banking system is controlled b y the Crown Temple a s well as the 'legal' system. Bar Associations are a warded their franchises by the four Inns of Court at Temple Bar. These are the Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn and they are nothing less than exclusive secret societies without charters or statutes. They are a law unto themselves. The Inner Temple controls the legal system franchise for Canada a nd Britain while the Middle Temple does the same for the United States. Queen Elizabeth II is a member of both temples. I have e xplained earlier in the boo k that the Illuminati always s eek to control both 'sides' in any situation. Thus at least five signatories to the American Declaration of Independence were Temple Bar Attorneys who h ad p ledged allegiance to the Crown! Another Middle Temple a gent during the formation of the United States was Alexander Hamilton who structured the American b anking system in line with the Crown Temple a genda for control of the new United States (a 'State' is a legal entity of the Crown - a Crown Colony!). As Michael Edward points out in an excellent Internet study: \"Americans were fooled into b elieving that the legal Crown Colonies comprising New England were independent nation states, but they never were nor are today. They were a nd still are Colonies of the Crown Temple, through letters patent and charters, who have no legal authority to b e independent from the Rule a nd Order of the Crown Temple. A legal State is a Crown Temple Colony. \"Neither the American people nor the Queen of Britain o wn America. The Crown Temple owns America through the deception of those who h ave worn their allegiance by oath to the Middle Templar Bar. The Crown Bankers and their Middle Templar Attorneys rule America through un lawful contracts, unlawful taxes, and ,contract documents of false e quity through debt deceit, all strictly enforced b y their completely unlawful, but 'legal', Orders, Rules and Codes of the Crown Temple Courts Our so-called 'judiciary' in America. This is because the Crown Temple holds the land titles and estate deeds to all of North America.\" Seven Middle Inn Templars who h ad pledged an o ath o f allegiance to the Crown Temple (including Alexander Hamilton) were a mong the members of the Constitutional Convention who signed the c ompleted 'American Constitution'. How symbolic it is that copies of the American Constitution and the Declaration of Independence hang on the wall of the library of the Middle Temple in London. After all, they were the force behind bo th of them. While Middle Bar Templars were orchestrating the illusion o f freedom from the perceived rule by King George III, the king, too, was a sworn member of the same Middle Temple. Michael Edward continues: \"1776 is the year that will truly live in infamy for all Americans. It is the year that the Crown Colonies became legal Crown States. The Declaration o f Independence was a legal, not lawful, document. It was s igned on bo th sides by representatives of the Crown Temple. Leg ally, it announ ced the status quo o f the Crown Colonies to that of the new legal name c a IIed 'States' as direct possessive e states of the Crown. \"The American p eople were h oodwinked into thinking they were de claring lawful inde pendence from the Crown. Proof that the Colonies are still in Crown possession is the u se o f the word 'State' to signify a 'legal estate o f possession.' Had this been a document of and by the people, both the Declaration of Independ ence and the U.S. Constitution would h ave been written u sing the word 'states'. By the u se of 'State'the significance o f a g overnment of estate possession was legally established. All of the North American States are Crown Templar possessions through their legal do cument, signed by their representation o f both parties to the contract, known a s the Constitution o f the United States of America. \" 2 Britain and Ireland are owned by the Roman Chu rch So the United States, together with Canada, the United Kingdo m and Ireland, are c ontrolled b y the Knights Templar 'Crown', bu t who o wns the Knights Templar 'Crown'? We ll, er, the Pope, or rather the Illumi nati t hat controls him. On May 15th 1213, ou r own fr iend King John, who was a puppet of the Templars, effectively signed away the Kingdo m of England and Ireland to Pope Inno cent III and the Roman Church, witnessed b y the CrownTemplars. As King John said at the time: \"I myself bearing witness in the hou se of the Knights Templars. The King John charter stated: "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"\"We wish it to be known to a ll of you, through this our charter, furnished with our seal ... not indu ced by force o r compelled by fear, but of our own go od and spontane ous will and by the common coun sel of our barons, do offer and freely conced e to God and His holy apo stles Peter and Paul an d to ou r mother the h oly Roman church, and to our-lord p ope Inno cent and to his Catholic s uccessors, the whole kingdo m of England and the whole kingdom Ireland , with all their rights and appurtenances .. : we pe rform and swear fealty for them to h im our aforesaid lord p ope Inno cent, and h is Catholic s uccessors and the Roman church ... binding ou r successors and ou r heirs by our wife forever, in similar manne r to pe rform fealty and sho w homage to h im who shall be chief pon tiff at that time, and to the Roman church without demur.

When King John signed the Magna Carta on June 15th 1 215 h e broke the terms of the c harter with the Pope a nd therefore lost the right to h is kingdom. Pope Innocent III then d eclared the Magna Carter null and void. From this time the 'Crown' passed fr om the monarch to the Knights Templar who, to this day, govern Britain on behalf of the Roman (Illuminati) Church. This means, if we take it a stage further, that ultimately, through the Crown Temple, the Roman Church also o wns the United States, Canada a nd all coun tries and Bar Associations controlled (overtly or covertly) by the Crown! This is why the Peace Treaty between the American Colonies and the British Crown in 1783 , stated: \"It having pleased the Divine Providen ce to d ispose the h earts of the most serene and most potent Prince George the Third, by the grace o f God, king o f Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, duke o f Brunswick and Lunebourg, arch-treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire etc., and of the United States of America ... \" {My emphasis) How ironic that a Roman Catholic is barred from being the British monarch while a ll along the monarch and the 'kingdom' have been owned b y the Roman Church. And the Roman Church is '\" the Church of Babylon .

Why do we raise the Palestinian flag? W hy d o we supp ort the Palestinian cause? \"You are Jews!\" they tell us. \"What are you do ing?\" And ou r response is very simple: \". It is precisely because we are Jews that we march with the Palestinians and raise their flag! It is precisely beca use we are Jews that we demand that the Palestinian p eople? be returned to their homes and p roperties! Yes, hi. our Torah we a re c ommanded to be fair. We a re c alled upon to pursue justice. And, what could b e more unjust then the ce ntury old attempt of the Zionist movement to invade a nother people's land, to drive them out and stealthier property? The early Zionists proclaimed that they were a people without a land going to a land without a people. Inno cent sounding words. But utterly and totally untrue. Palestine was a land with a people. A people that were developing a national consciousness. We have no doub t that would Jewish refugees have c ome to Palestine not with the intention of dominating, not with the intention of aking a Jewish state, not with the intention of dispossessing, not with the intention of depriving the Palestinians of their basic rights, that they would h ave been welcomed by the Palestinians, with the same hospitality that Islam ic peoples have sho wn Jews throughout history. And we would h ave lived together as Jews and M uslim s lived b efore in Palestine in p eace a nd h armon y. To our Islamic a nd Palestinian friends around the world, p lease hear our message. There a re Jews around the world who supp ort your cause. And when we suppo rt your cause we do n ot mean some partition scheme propo sed in 19 47 b y a UN that had no right to offer it. When we say supp ort your cause we do n ot mean the cut off and cut up pieces of the W est Bank offered b y Barak at Camp David together with justice for less than 10 % of the refugees. We do no t mean anything other than returning the entire land, including Jerusalem, to Palestinian sovereignty! At that point justice demands that the Palestinian people should decide if and how many Jews shou ld remain in the Land. This is the only path to true reconciliation. But we demand yet more. WE demand that in returning the land back to its rightful owners we have not yet don e enou gh. There should b e a n apology to the Palestinian people which is clear and p recise. Zionism did you wrong. Zionism stole your homes. Zionism stole your land. \" By so p roclaiming we proclaim before the world that we are the people of the Torah, that our faith d emands that we be honest and fair and good and kind. We have attended hun dreds of pro-Palestinian rallies over the years and everywhere we go the leaders and audience greet us with the warmth of Middle Eastern hospitality. What a lie it i s to say that Palestinians in p articular or Muslims in general hate Jews. You hate injustice. Not Jews. Fear not my friends. Evil cannot long triumph. The Zionist nightmare is at its end. It is exhausted. Its latest brutalities are the death rattle of the terminally ill. We will yet both live to see the day when Jew and Palestinian will embrace in peace under the Palestinian flag in Jerusalem .. And u ltimately when mankind's Redeemer will come the sufferings of the present will l ong be forgotten in the blessings of the future.
