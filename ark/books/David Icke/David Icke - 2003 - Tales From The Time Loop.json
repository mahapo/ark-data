That is especially important today with so many people urgentlyneeding to understand where the world is being led, by whom, and to what end. Ihave structured the book to explore the various levels of the global conspiracyand the manipulation of our reality in this illusion I call the Matrix. Exposureof the Illuminati agenda has mostly focussed on the five-sense ‘world’, thenames, dates, places, people level of the cosmic ‘game’. You will find a lot ofthat in this book, especially with regard to the invasion of Iraq and themanufactured ‘war on terrorism’. This information is important to know, but whatis happening is far bigger than that.To understand the plot and deal with its five-sense expression we need toappreciate from what and from where it all emanates. I have, therefore, writtenthe book in four sections to describe the distinct levels of manipulation andcontrol and how they connect with each other. The main emphasis is on the natureof reality and how we create it because this is the knowledge that will set usfree. Once we know how the game works and how we are being manipulated tomanifest our own prison, we can free ourselves from those chains ofself-delusion.It has been essential to include information that readers of my other works willalready be aware of. They may wish to skip those sections and concentrate onlyon the wealth of new information, but given the way everything fits intoeverything else it might be worth them reminding themselves of what they haveread before to allow the relevance of the new revelations to be seen in itssharpest focus.David Icke"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEWakey, wakey > Sit down before fact like a little child, and be prepared to give up every> preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abyss Nature> leads, or you shall learn nothing. > T.

It is important that we know this information and continue to addto the knowledge of how we are imprisoned by our ‘free world’. But there is moreto know and do: much more. I knew that for me to take the story on andunderstand the even greater context in which this manipulation is unfolding, Iwould have to see into other dimensions of reality beyond the ‘world’ that wedaily experience. This is exactly what happened to me in the Amazon rainforestof Brazil in 2003. What I learned from these journeys of the mind is the majorfocus of this book. Many of those who have been reading my work thus far willfind some of this extremely challenging as we close in, still further, on thenature of the human condition and the force that seeks to control and imprisonus in a manufactured illusion – ‘the Matrix’.Born to be freeWhat happened in the Amazon is the latest stage in a fantastic journey ofdiscovery, or rediscovery, that I consciously began in 1990 when my life andperceptions were transformed by events that at one point threatened to destroyme. But all they were doing was setting me free from the delusions laid out toentrap us in this prison of the mind. I also realised that, while I only becameconsciously aware of a guiding force in 1989, the journey that I continue totravel began from the moment I was born, and in fact, as we measure ‘time’, longbefore. Many people ask me how I became involved in researching and exposing theglobal conspiracy. In this opening chapter I am going to summarise thebackground to what happened to me. It is extremely relevant to my experiences inthe Amazon and the way the information about the conspiracy has been presentedto me day after day with such synchronicity since 1990.I was born in Leicester, England, at around 6.15pm on April 29th 1952. I grew upin what they call in Britain a ‘working class’ family. This is often another wayof saying ‘skint’, and in our case it certainly was. My father was Beric, theproduct of the toughest of lives, and the biggest influence on me in those earlyyears. He was extremely sharp intellectually, but his background of poverty anddaily survival meant that he could never achieve his ambition to be a doctor.Only those with money had any chance of that and my father had to leave schoolto provide an income for his family after his own father did a runner and leftthem. These times left scars with him that he carried for the rest of his lifeand so did his experiences in the Great Depression of the 1930s when once hewalked from London to Blackpool, a distance of some 200 miles, looking for workduring the manufactured ‘slump’ in which unemployment soared while thoseresponsible for it added massively to their wealth.He joined the Army Medical Corps during the Second World War and won the BritishEmpire Medal for pulling airmen out of a blazing plane that crash-landed at theChipping Warden Airbase in Oxfordshire in 1943. He also served in the MiddleEast and moved up through Italy as the fascists retreated. He was stunned to seeRoman Catholic churches with untold wealth in places like Naples surrounded byunbelievable poverty while those in such dire need went on giving to theirmerciless religion. It made him vehemently anti-religion for the rest of hislife, but unfortunately he also rejected any idea of life after ‘death’ becausehe equated that with the view of the religions he so despised. His Naplesstories, and many more that he told me, shaped my outlook on life from a veryearly age. Any expressions of unfairness, injustice and imposition have alwayspressed my buttons. From the start I was a rebel questioning the establishedorder. My mother, Barbara, was the opposite of my father. He was dominating andwanted to control; she went quietly along doing whatever was necessary for herfamily. If you needed someone in a trench with you – she was among the first youshould call.My earliest memory is sitting at an old battered table in a dark and dingy room.On the table was a bottle of sterilised milk, much used by the ‘working class’of the 1950s because it lasted longer than the other sort. That memory has comeflooding back whenever I have smelled the distinctive whiff of sterilised milk.The scene was in a tiny terraced slum of a house in Lead Street, just off WharfStreet, in the run-down centre of Leicester, an industrial city in the EnglishEast Midlands. I lived in Lead Street for the first three years or so of my lifeand the sterilised milk is all I can recall. My second memory is running for thebus when we moved to a big new council estate on the outskirts of Leicester andthe house where my mother and younger brother, Paul, still live some 50 yearson. It is right across the road from the Leicester General Hospital where I wasborn. Money was short, seriously short, throughout my childhood and I remembergoing with my mother around the back of the Gents clock factory on ‘pay day’Thursdays, so my father could sneak out and hand over his wages to buy thatnight’s dinner. Money in the bank? What’s a bank?? As the old joke goes, until Iwas 14 I thought knives and forks were jewellery. On a number of occasions whenthere was a knock on the door my mother would tell me to hide under the windowor behind a chair. There we would stay, still and quiet, until she gave the allclear. I had no idea what this was all about until later when I realised theknock was the council rent man coming to collect the money we didn’t have and,when no one answered, he would walk around the house looking in the windows.This happened many times and it’s funny, I sometimes still get a knot in mystomach when there’s a knock at the door.Throughout my childhood I always felt different, although I didn’t know why. Ifelt there was something I was here to do, but what? I was a loner and I spenthours, day after day, playing by myself with little metal trains on thewindowsill, lost in my own world. My mother has often recalled how I was so shythat I would cross the street to avoid speaking to people I knew. All theseyears and many public professions later, I still prefer my own space and privacyand once a public event is over I just want to get away and disappear from view.This has always been an apparent contradiction with me; in the public eye as aprofessional soccer player, national television presenter, politician and nowauthor and challenger of conventional thought, yet all along I have been aperson who dislikes ‘limelight’ and would prefer to be anonymous. This is nothowever, a contradiction, as I will explain later on. I have always beenextremely sensitive emotionally and from the earliest time I can remember I havebeen scanning the whole spectrum of human emotion, often flipping from one toanother very quickly. Again there is a reason for this, I was later tounderstand.One thing I knew from childhood is that I was not going to be one of the crowd.I was going to be different and if I couldn’t be different I didn’t want to behere. I wasn’t going to accept a future based on the fact that I was ‘workingclass’ and therefore destined for a factory or some low paid job doing whatsomeone else told me to do. I am not knocking those who do that, far from it.Without such people all those things we buy in the shops, including food, wouldnot be there and I think the wages paid in these essential and hugelyundervalued jobs is a disgrace. Keep the streets clean and they pay you apittance; play the casino in Wall Street or the City of London, gambling withthe very survival of millions of people, and they pay you a fortune. So I am notdemeaning those who work in factories and find themselves pawns in a dictatorialand unjust system; it is simply that I decided early in my life that this wasnot going to be for me. How I would escape from such a fate was not exactlyclear, I just knew that I would. I failed the so-called Eleven-Plus exam thatdecided if my latter years at school would be in an elite grammar school (forthe ‘brightest and the best’) or a secondary modern (for all the rest). I had nointerest in school, it bored me rigid, and I only went because I had to and itallowed me to play for the soccer team. I rarely did more than average or lessin exams, not least because I couldn’t care less what grades I achieved. Ireally didn’t give a damn about logarithms or algebra or binary systems or anyof the other stuff they were telling me to absorb or believe. The only time Idid well was one year at primary school when the teacher ridiculed andhumiliated me in front of the class and said I was basically stupid. Immediatelyafter this public put-down the teacher set a spelling test, hardly my bestsubject even to this day. But at the end of the lesson the poor guy had tosomehow announce to the class that the child he had just ridiculed scoredhighest in the test. I can still hear him choking. That year I came top of theclass in the annual exams, but with a point proven to myself and the miserableteacher I went back to snoring through the rest of my time in the appallingschool system, which is not there to educate, but to indoctrinate. It is sosplendidly captured in that superb song by Pink Floyd – “Hey teacher, leavethose kids alone; all in all it’s just another brick in the wall.” I was notgoing to be in the wall. I would have jumped off it first.The soccer playerFootball, or soccer as they call it in the United States, was my salvation, myescape from the net that trawled the schools of ‘working class’ kids and pouredthem into the system’s sausage machine. I was spotted by a teacher at primaryschool playing in the kick-about soccer games in the playground. He asked me togo for a trial for the school team and if he hadn’t asked I wouldn’t have gone.The thought that David Icke would get in the team never occurred to me. Ithought those things happened to others, not me. But I was picked and myself-confidence soared. I was about nine or ten and now I knew what my escaperoute would be. I was going to be a professional footballer. This would seem tohave been a ridiculous ambition because the number of kids who make it to theprofessional game is an infinitesimal fraction of those who want to befootballers. But I was certain from the start that it was going to happen. Iwould spend hours every day with a football. My father would say on manyoccasions that I was never going to earn a living kicking a ball about and Ishould think about what I was really going to do when I left school. I didn’tconsider anything else, not once. I knew I was going to be a professionalfootballer and that was it. I was a goalkeeper, which suited my personalityperfectly. Usually it’s not easy finding kids who want to be goalkeepers becausethey all want to be outfield players scoring the goals. Often it was the lad whowas the worst outfield player who got shoved in goal. But from the beginning Ialways wanted to be the goalkeeper. In many ways it is a loner position, a partof the team, yes, but with a very different role and different skills from theother players. That instinctively appealed to me and so did the responsibilityof being the last line of defence. If outfield players make mistakes they stillhave you to get them out of trouble, but when a keeper makes an error it isinvariably punished with a goal and recorded on the score sheet. I liked thatsense of living on the edge with the difference between hero and villain sofinely balanced.I went on playing for school teams, but by the time I was 13, just two yearsbefore I was to leave for the dreaded adult world, there was still no sign thatI would be heading for a professional football club. Then, right on cue, a‘lucky break’ set me on my way. This has been such a feature of my life. Justwhen I have needed help to achieve something, bingo! There it is, often at alate hour when all seems lost. In those days if you wanted to attract theattention of the professional clubs you had to be playing for your town or cityschools representative side, the best of all the schoolboy players in your area.The big clubs didn’t bother looking below that level because they figured if youwere not good enough to represent your city you would be of no interest to them.I was 13, a crucial time to impress the scouts looking for the best youngtalent, and I was nowhere near playing in the games they were watching. By now Iwas attending Crown Hills Secondary Modern School in Leicester and spending mostof my time staring out of the classroom window daydreaming away the boredom ofthe curriculum, little of which ever registered. Then one day the sports teachertold me he was sending me for a trial for the Leicester schoolboys under-14team, but I would be going as an outfield player. There was a highly-ratedgoalkeeper at the trial that was certain to be selected, he said, and it wasn’tworth me trying to compete with him. This was a lad who was already playing forthe older under-15 Leicester team and so it was taken for granted that he wouldplay for the younger side also. But ‘fate’, as usual in my life, was tointervene.I played outfield in the first trial game and was pretty hopeless. My heart wasnot in it because I only wanted to be a goalkeeper. I was asked to go andkick-around with other rejected boys while the second trial match was played.That’s the end of that, I thought. Then I heard a shout from where the trial wascontinuing. “Hey, can any of you lads play in goal?” bellowed the team manager.“Yes”, I shouted and I ran towards him as quickly as I could before anyone elsecould lay claim. One of the two goalkeepers had been injured and could notcontinue and when I took over I did so well that the manager asked me to come tothe next trial a week later as a reserve goalkeeper to the one so highly rated.That day was to change my life. In the next trial game I played as well as Iever played in my entire career. The teams were seriously uneven and I wasbombarded with shots from every angle. It was one of those days when if I haddived the wrong way the ball would have found the end of my foot and beendeflected away. It was almost as if I could not let in a goal even if I tried. Iwas picked for the team above the lad everyone thought was a certainty. The nextyear I played for the Leicester under-15 team and the professional clubs beganto knock on my door. I signed for Coventry City, then in England’s top division,and I left school to earn my living doing exactly what I wanted to do. I was aprofessional footballer, just as I knew I would always be.Awaking to a nightmareAs it turned out, my football career was soon in trouble when I developed whatthey told me was rheumatoid arthritis at just 15 and a half. It started in theleft knee and progressed to both knees and both ankles. In the years after mycareer ended, the pain and swelling went on to infiltrate my wrists, hands andall my fingers. For years I refused to bow to the doctors’ verdict that I shouldstop playing. Staggeringly when I look back, I continued to play successfullyfor Coventry for four years despite the arthritis before I was told either tostop playing or to face life in a wheelchair. I was 19 when they gave me thatverdict, but still determined to play on. I joined another club, HerefordUnited, and enjoyed a year of great success before the end came literallyovernight. The arthritis was so bad in that final year that every daily trainingsession was agony until the joints were warmed up. I would be limping at thestart of each session and every day I would have some excuse to hide the commoncause. It would be a blister or a stiff calf muscle or something because I knewthat if the club knew the real cause they would be looking for a new goalkeeper.The buzz and adrenalin would get me through the games and I was playing well, sono questions were asked. We won promotion to a higher division, I was playing ina professional league football team at just 20 and some bigger clubs werebeginning to show an interest. Then one night I looked down at my knees before Igot into bed and saw that the swelling in my left knee had disappeared for thefirst time since I was 15. I was elated and thought to myself, “Hey, I’m beatingit.” The following morning as I began to awaken in a half-sleep, I realised thatI could not breathe. I tried for what seemed an age to take in air and I thoughtI was going to die. I tried to nudge my then wife, Linda, lying beside me, but Iwas unable to move a single muscle. Suddenly I gasped a breath and, as my bodycame back to life, I realised that what seemed like every joint in my body wasagony. I could not move on the bed, let alone walk and, although the pain andlack of mobility were to ease with the days, I was never to play football again.Media manI was just turned 21, an ex-professional footballer, virtually crippled at thetime with arthritis, and, to my knowledge, with no other potential skill orprofession to earn my living. Happy days. In such dire straights I did whatanyone would do: I decided I was going to be a network television presenter. Iwas interviewed on a live TV programme about the ending of my soccer career andI loved the atmosphere and the whole deal. This is for me, I thought, and I setmy target of presenting the BBC’s Grandstand, then the biggest and best sportsshow on British television. This was apparently even more ludicrous than myambitions to play soccer for a living. At least there were around a hundredgoalkeepers in professional teams, but you could count the BBC sports presenterson one hand. So now this shy guy, who loves privacy and anonymity, wanted to bea national television anchorman. Bizarre on the face of it, but something justdrove me on and, once again, I knew it was going to happen. I was told that theway to television news and sport would be by first working in newspapers andradio. There was an immediate problem, however. With no academic qualificationsof any shape or form it was not going to be easy finding a paper to take me on.Having worked in the media and seen it from the outside I can safely confirmthat academic qualifications are absolutely no measure of intelligence, butthat’s what the system demands because examination passes confirm that you havepassed successfully through its indoctrination machine. Anyway, eventually I gota job, by ‘coincidence’ back in Leicester, on a weekly newspaper that was justabout read by the people who wrote it. The paper was called the LeicesterAdvertiser and if its circulation had been human it would have been on a lifesupport machine. I got the job because no one else wanted it. But soon I wasmoving on with doors opening and closing to perfection to speed me through toradio and then television.I worked as a news reporter and presenter with BBC regional and national newsbefore, in 1982, becoming a nationally known anchorman with BBC TelevisionSport, the very job I had targeted all those years earlier when I was told mysoccer career was over. The day I first presented Grandstand I remember drivingto the BBC in tears. It was nothing to do with fronting a TV show; it wasachieving what I set out to do when my life and health were in tatters. Myfather used to say to me that you are never finished until you tell yourself youare finished, no matter what others may say. I would recall those words manytimes in the years to come. What he was saying, without knowing he was speakinga profound truth, is that we all create our own reality. What we believe is whatwill manifest in our experience. Later I will discuss the simple process thatallows this to happen.The ‘politician’Soon after I had achieved my long-held ambition to work in television, the joblost its appeal. I found television to be a deeply insincere world full ofinsecure, often shallow and sometimes vicious people. Within a few years Iwanted out. As someone once said to me, media people can get so confused theystab each other in the chest. There were, and are, many exceptions, but they arenot usually in the positions of hire and fire because to make it that far youneed to have no problem with trampling over others or licking arse, often both.I continued to work for the BBC, in body if not in spirit, for another eightyears, but my real focus was now elsewhere. From childhood I had loved ‘nature’and what has now been termed ‘the environment’. I would ride for hours on mybike through the Leicestershire countryside enjoying the beauty and thesolitude. As the 1980s progressed the protection of the environment became thecentre of my life. I began an environmental pressure group on the Isle of Wight,just off England’s south coast, where I have lived for more than 20 years. But Irealised that no matter how good your arguments about an environmental issue theonly thing that mattered was the number of hands in the air at the local councilmeetings when the vote was taken. If you didn’t have the majority supportingyour case, its strength or validity was irrelevant. I also began to understandthat often the councillors’ decisions on which way to vote were being agreed atthe local Freemasons’ temple before the ‘debate’ in the council chamber had evenbeen heard.I decided that the environment needed a voice on the council and my career, ifyou can call it that, in politics had begun. What happened next is anotherexample of the way some unseen force has been weaving my life experience. Irejected all the major political parties because I didn’t trust any of them.Instead, in 1988 I wrote to the little known UK Green Party, which made theprotection of the environment the centre of its policies. They sent me someinformation that seemed to be sensible and I sent off my membership fee andbegan to organise public meetings to start a branch of the Greens on the Isle ofWight. Things began to move very fast. Within a couple of weeks I received aletter from the Green Party’s regional organiser asking us to send arepresentative of the new Isle of Wight branch to their next meeting. I wentalong and at the end it was announced that their regional representative on thenational party council was resigning and they needed nominations for hisreplacement. With no one wanting the job, I said I would do it and even so twopeople voted against me! I think they believed that being in television was‘ungreen’. Anyway, another two weeks later I turned up at my first nationalcouncil meeting in a building near Regents Park in London and found it awashwith naval contemplators who could talk for England while never reaching aconclusion. I could completely understand why the Green Party had been such anonentity in British politics. Just before lunch the ‘chairperson’ said theywere looking for party spokesmen and women, or ‘Party Speakers’ as the Greenscalled them, to represent the party in the media for the coming year, andnominations would be taken during the afternoon. During lunch I was approachedby a guy who said he thought it would be good to have someone well known in themedia to represent the party and would I be interested? I said, “OK, I’ll giveit a try.” An hour or so later I was elected a National Speaker for the UK GreenParty. I had been a member for a matter of weeks.My appointment coincided with a surge of interest in the environment, fuelled bya series of prime-time television programmes highlighting the plight ofrainforests and the consequences of pollution. By the summer of 1989 thisreached a peak of public concern and suddenly the UK Green Party was big newswhen we won 15 % of the national vote in elections to the European Parliament.Up to this point the party had rarely registered more than 1%. From empty pressconferences and empty halls, the party, and its official speakers, were thrustonto the national news and into the political limelight. The Green Party hadarrived, but, as it transpired, not for long. A battle ensued between those inthe party who wanted to be true to its original beliefs (the ‘fundis’ orfundamentalists) and those who liked the success and were pressing to droppolicies they believed were preventing even more support (the ‘realos’ orrealists). I was a ‘fundi-realo’ in that I wanted to stick with the values, butpresent them to the public in a much more effective way. I wrote a book calledIt Doesn’t Have To Be Like This (Green Print, London, 1989) with this end inmind. But the infighting sickened me and more so when it became clear that whilethe Green Party claimed to be the ‘new politics’, it was just another version ofthe old politics with the same old methods, manipulations and reactions. TheGreen Party set out to challenge the system and ended up joining it. Many timesit has been reported that I was “sacked” by the Green Party for what was now tounfold in my life, but the truth is that I never renewed my membership becausethe Greens were clearly not going to change anything. Ironically, another reasonI distanced myself from the party in the months that followed was because somevery strange things were happening to me and I knew that when I spoke about thempublicly I was going to be in for some serious ridicule.I had reached the most pivotal point in my life and what I had experienced thisfar was going to be so important in what was to come. I had felt the emotionaltrauma of seeing my dreams of being a footballer shattered by arthritis. Inpursuing a cure I had been introduced to the ancient Chinese healing art ofacupuncture and that had opened me to an understanding that there is far more tothe human being than just a physical body. Playing in such pain had triggered adetermination to overcome adversity and to keep going, no matter what thechallenges and the odds. Journalism had shown me how the media works and howmuch the ‘news’ is manipulated. I was able to see how the media is structured toconfirm the official version of events and not to question or investigate thisofficial reality. I could see that most journalists are some of the mostuniformed, conditioned and imprisoned people you could ever meet. How can theyreport the world as it is when they have not got a clue how it is? Journalismalso allowed me, through the demands of newspaper space, to develop the abilityto write concisely and communicate to an audience spanning the whole spectrum ofknowledge on the subjects in question. My television career presented insightsinto that medium’s manipulations, techniques and often unbelievable shallowness,both on the screen and off. The national public profile it gave me also ensuredthat I would be widely reported when the time came for me to consciously awakenand see beyond the illusion. My time in the Green Party showed me politics fromthe inside and how it is a game of power not principle, no matter what the nameon the door may be. I saw how many politicians who opposed and condemned eachother in public ‘debate’ were very much closer in private. My life this far hadgiven me all that I needed for what was to come.Wake up callI began to be aware of strange happenings around me from the time I was writingmy environmental book, It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, in 1989. I was writingvery fast, often a chapter a day, and when I read it back each evening I wouldkeep thinking to myself, “Where did this come from?” and “I don’t rememberwriting that line.” It was like I was writing it all in a dream. At this sametime I began to feel a presence around me. When I was in a room alone it felt asif someone else was there and this went on for months as I continued my workwith the BBC. Eventually I was sitting on the side of the bed in a hotel room inLondon in early 1990 and the presence felt so strong that I said out loud: “Ifyou are there will you please contact me because you are driving me up thewall.” Soon afterwards events began to accelerate.In March 1990, I was playing soccer with my son Gareth, then aged eight, on theseafront at Ryde on the Isle of Wight and I said to him we would go for lunch atthe railway station cafe nearby. The cafe was full and as we headed for analternative someone recognised me from the television and began to ask mequestions about soccer. When the conversation was over, I couldn’t see Gareth,but I knew he would be in the newspaper shop at the station looking at booksabout steam trains in which we both have an interest. And so he was. I stood atthe entrance to the shop and said to Gareth that we would go and find anothercafe, but, as I turned to leave, my feet were stuck to the ground as if twomagnets were anchoring them to the floor. It was a very weird feeling, almost asif, as I now understand, another reality had manifested around me. As I stoodthere, my feet fixed to the spot, I heard a very clear voice in my mind say: “Goand look at the books on the far side.” Shit, what was that? What the hell isgoing on here? I knew this news shop very well and the books in that ‘far side’section were of no interest to me. They were invariably romantic fiction of theBarbara Cartland variety. But given what the voice said I went over to see whatwould happen, not least because that was the only direction my feet would move.I was immediately attracted to a book with a woman’s face on the front. It waslike this was the only book I could see, a feeling I have had endless timessince. I turned it over to read the blurb and saw the word psychic. The authorwas a professional psychic and ‘hands on’ healer and I thought at once of thepresence I had been feeling around me for all those months. Would this lady beable to tell me what was going on? I read the book in 24 hours and contacted herto make an appointment. I said nothing about the presence, only that I hadarthritis and I wanted to see if her healing could help. I was not going to sayanything about what had been happening to me unless she picked up the storypsychically.Is anybody there?I only saw her four times and in the first two visits nothing happened of note,except that I talked with her about other dimensions or frequencies of existenceand a much wider vision of life and Creation. I had always rejected religion andalso the absurd idea pedalled by ‘science’ that we are all ‘accidents’ of‘evolution’ who cease to exist at ‘death’. Unbelievable rubbish, but that islargely still the claim of establishment ‘science’ despite the wealth ofevidence and research, including that of open-minded real scientists, whichdemolishes such claptrap. Up to this point I had never really pondered on analternative to this nonsense, but as I talked with the psychic I was immediatelyat one with what she was saying about the multi-dimensional nature of realityand the ability of one dimension to communicate with others. It was as if shewas telling me what I already knew – which is exactly what she was doing. We allknow this information, but we have been conditioned to forget who and what wereally are because that suits the agenda of the manipulators.For those new to such ideas, some background is necessary. We don’t live in a‘world’ so much as a frequency range; the one that our five-senses can accessand perceive and the five-sense range of perception is tiny. Creation is notstructured like a chest of draws, one level on top of another. It is made up offrequencies sharing the same space in the same way that all the radio andtelevision frequencies do. Those broadcast frequencies are not just around yourbody at this moment, they are sharing the same space. This is possible becausethey are operating on a different frequency range or wavelength to your body andeach other. Only when the frequencies are really close do we get ‘interference’and become aware of another station. Apart from that all are oblivious to eachother’s existence because they literally operate in different frequencies,different ‘realities’ or ‘worlds’. When you tune your radio to a station, sayRadio 1, that’s what you get. You don’t hear Radio 2, 3, or 4 because they arenot broadcasting on the wavelength to which your radio is tuned. Move the dialfrom the frequency of Radio 1 to Radio 2 and now, obviously, you hear Radio 2.But Radio 1 did not cease to broadcast when you moved the dial from itswavelength. It goes on broadcasting – existing – while your focus, yourconsciousness, is tuned to something else.This is precisely the principle on which Creation operates, or at least the partthat we are currently experiencing. The five-senses through which we see, hear,smell, touch and taste can perceive an infinitesimal fraction of that whichexists in the space you think you are ‘seeing’ now. This is why animals, likecats, jump around reacting to what appears to us to be ‘empty’ space. To thecats, the space is not empty at all. They have a greater visual frequency rangeand they can see entities and scenes that are beyond the frequency limits of thehuman five-senses. When people say that everything is within you or,symbolically, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, this is correct. All infinityis within us because all of infinity shares all space. The point is, however,that we can’t see all of infinity with our five-senses, just as you cannot hearall the radio stations available by tuning to one of them. We see only that tinypart of infinity that is vibrating to the frequency range of those senses – whatwe see, hear, touch, smell and taste. This is what I call the five-sense prisonbecause most people are so trapped in its manufactured and manipulated illusionsthat they believe that this is all that exists and all that they are. It istheir only reality. This is further ingrained and conditioned by the ‘education’system, the media and ‘science’, all of which are dominated by the belief thatthe ‘world’ of the five-senses is basically all that there is. This is what themanipulators want us to believe for reasons I will explore in due course. Whenenergy is vibrating slowly it appears to us to be ‘dense’ and ‘solid’, but lookat it under a microscope and no matter how ‘solid’ something seems to be it isstill vibrating energy. As the speed of vibration increases the energy becomesless and less dense until it is vibrating so quickly that it leaves thefrequency range of the five-senses and to human perception ‘disappears’. It hasnot disappeared in fact; it has simply left the range that human senses canaccess. This is happening when people say they saw a ghost or a ‘UFO’ and it‘appeared’ out of nowhere and then ‘disappeared’. The conditioned five-sensereality thinks these people must be mad because such things are not possible.Oh, but they are. The ‘nowhere’ from which such manifestations come and go issimply another frequency or wavelength of existence. Understanding all this iscrucial to appreciating that the ‘far out’ world of the so-called ‘paranormal’is perfectly and simply explainable. The longer this book goes on the simpler itwill become.On the third visit to the psychic, I was lying on the couch during the healingsession when I felt like a spider’s web on my face. I had remembered reading inher book that this can happen when ‘spirits’ are trying to make contact. Funnilyenough I have never felt it since. I said nothing to her, but within ten tofifteen seconds she pushed her head back and said: “This is powerful; I’ll haveto close my eyes for this one!” She said she was seeing a Chinese-type figure inher mind, who said that “Socrates is with me”. Socrates (469–399 BC) was theGreek philosopher and genius who’s most famous pupil was Plato. At the age of70, Socrates was charged by the authorities with heresy and corruption of localyouth and he carried out the death sentence himself by drinking hemlock. Among alibrary of famous quotes, Socrates said, “Wisdom is knowing how little we know.”The ‘Chinese figure’ was only a projection from another dimension into the mindof the psychic to give her a familiar image to focus on. The communicator wasconsciousness from beyond the realm of the ‘physical’ body and can take any formit chooses. This is what we all are in our highest form, pure consciousness. The‘physical’ body is only a vehicle for that consciousness to experience thesedense ‘five-sense’ frequencies of existence. The other-dimensional communicatorprojects thought into a psychic’s mind and he or she decodes that into humanlanguage. It is the same principle as the radio programmes that are broadcastfrom the transmitter in wave form and decoded into words by the radio. AnItalian psychic will ‘hear’ the thought projections in Italian, an English onein English and so on. This is how the psychic reported some of what the‘Chinese’ figure had to say to and about me:> He is a healer who is here to heal the Earth and he will be world famous. He> will face enormous opposition, but we will always be there to protect him. > He is still a child spiritually, but he will be given the spiritual riches. > Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from. They will be our> words. Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times he will be led> to knowledge. > He was chosen as a youngster for his courage. He has been tested and has> passed all the tests. > He was led into football to learn discipline, but when that was learned it was> time to move on. He also had to learn how to cope with disappointment,> experience all the emotions and how to get up and get on with it. The> spiritual way is tough and no one makes it easy. > We know he wanted us to contact him, but the time wasn’t right. He was led> here to be contacted, not to be cured. But one day he will be completely> cured. > He will always have what he needs [this could have been “wants”], but no more. In the next session with the psychic the figure appeared to her again and thesewords were given to me:> One man cannot change the world, but one man can communicate the message that> will change the world. > Don’t try to do it all alone. Go hand in hand with others, so you can pick> each other up as you fall. > He will write five books in three years. > Politics is not for him. He is too spiritual. Politics is anti-spiritual and> will make him very unhappy. > He will leave politics. He doesn’t have to do anything. It will happen> gradually over a year [exactly what happened]. > There will be a different kind of flying machine, very different from the> aircraft of today. Time will have no meaning. Where you want to be, you will> be. I was a BBC television presenter introducing the sport and a national spokesmanfor the Green Party. Yet here I was being told that I was a healer who was hereto heal the Earth and that one man cannot change the world, but one man cancommunicate the message that will change the world. Ugh? Come again??? On onelevel it seemed so ridiculous, but something within me knew I had to go withthis and see where it led. What happened as a result of this unstoppable urge towalk this path is that my life went through upheavals that were almost too muchfor my emotions to bear. But, all these years and so much pain later, what I wastold would happen has either happened or is happening. The idea that I wouldwrite five books in three years on subjects about which, at that time, I knewnothing seemed especially ridiculous. But I was to complete those books in threeyears to the very month. When I told some of the Green Party leadership aboutthese experiences, their reaction was just as closed-minded, ignorant anduninformed as you would find anywhere in the system the Greens were claiming tochallenge. “David is going crazy”, said the rumours that began to circulate fromthose I had told. Yeah, right. Welcome to the new politics! It was a very mildprecursor to what was to follow. ‘Coincidence’ would lead me to other psychicsin this early awakening period and they did not know what the others had toldme. Yet the themes were constant. There was a shadow across the world that hadto be lifted, a story that had to be told, and I was going to tell it. Amongthese communications were:> Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only> have to follow the clues … We are guiding you along a set path. You are> learning according to our teaching of you. It was all organised before you> incarnated. > True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, but> it will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you> receive whether you like it or not. Ponder on anything you do not like and see> if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much easier. > He is a solidifier of thought who helps the Word to surface in people he> meets. > So you are being asked to change. You are being asked to change in a total> way. It is not a matter of small changes, of a little thing here, a little> thing there. You are really being asked to turn [yourself] inside out. There> is a massive shadow which must be cleared and it is up to Light Workers such> as [yourself] to focus … on that challenge. > Those of you who are in the forefront of this, you are rather like a> snowplough. You are the thin end of the wedge. You really have, how shall I> put this? To a certain extent, I suppose, you have the shitty end of the job.> You have got to do an awful lot, but nevertheless you are capable of doing an> awful lot. That is why you have chosen to come, that is what you are here for,> to really shovel some shit, and therefore make some space behind you to make> it easier for the others. The theme of great upheavals and a transformation of human consciousness wasanother constant one and it continues to this day as I understand more and moreof its nature and see the effect it is having on increasingly vast numbers ofpeople. I was told that we had been trapped in a “freeze vibration” and thatthis low vibrational ‘solidity’ was being transformed. I learned much later thatmany ancient traditions say that the ‘physical world’ was once far more fluidand less dense than we experience today and the aborigines in Australia say theEarth is destined to return to this higher vibrational state they call‘Dreamtime’. We are certainly in the midst of enormous change that will set this‘world’ free of its subservience, ignorance and density (in every sense).Bye, bye BeebWithin a few weeks of that first contact through the psychic healer, the BBC, orthe ‘Beeb’ as it is known, told me they were not renewing my contract and, ineffect, I was fired. This was a shock given all the letters I had received fromBBC staff commending my work and the fact that I was still very young to bedoing the job and should have had decades ahead of me. The main reason wasclearly pressure from the BBC hierarchy to get rid of me because of my GreenParty activities and especially my refusal to pay the Poll Tax introduced duringthe dictatorial reign of Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. It demanded thatrich and poor pay the same, a blatant injustice, and I was one of millions whowithheld payment in protest at its unfairness. These millions eventually had toappear in court and there was enormous media interest when the first cases wereheard. Now fate stepped in again. The first cases could have reached courtanywhere in the United Kingdom, but where did it happen? At Newport, the littlemarket town of the Isle of Wight, where my case was among those on the list. Iarrived at the court to a blur of television cameras and newspaper reporters andphotographers as they came to record the first Poll Tax protestors beingprosecuted. Except that they weren’t, it was to turn out. I waited for hours asrow after row of protestors were dealt with for their refusal (often inability)to pay. They couldn’t deal with them individually because there were so many.Then, at last, I was called and stood before the magistrates with six or sevenothers to face the charges. But one in the group, a guy I had met at Poll Taxprotest meetings, put his hand in the air and asked a question. He pointed outthe date by which the payments should have been made and the date on which thesummonses were sent out to non-payers ordering them to appear in court. He thenrevealed that, according to the law, the period between the two dates was tooshort and the prosecutions happening that day were illegal. The atmosphere inthe court changed immediately and the magistrates adjourned for discussions.When they returned around half an hour later they had to announce that the manwas correct and all prosecutions that day were invalid and everyone was free togo. I pointed out to the magistrates that it was not that simple. People hadbeen brought to court illegally and had lost a day’s earnings and incurredtransport costs as a result. What about the compensation? The authorities had nochoice, but to agree. Loss of earnings was repaid and I was to receive a chequefor £2.50 for my bus fare. These events were blazed across the television newsand the front pages of all the newspapers and Margaret Thatcher’s Poll Tax was anational joke. From this point, with its credibility demolished, it had nochance of survival and had to be replaced with one more in tune with the abilityto pay.The next morning I arrived at the BBC to see the corporation’s head of sport todiscuss my ‘future’. All across his table were the morning papers recording thePoll Tax fiasco in Newport with my face on most of them. “What I am going to sayhas nothing to do with that”, he said, pointing at the papers. Mmmm. I was toldbasically that I had no future at the BBC and a few weeks later we partedcompany after eleven years with not even a thank-you or a best of luck. The BBCis actually an arrogant and often vicious organisation that treats its stafflike cattle. But then so do most other television companies, that’s the natureof the beast.The new beginningMy old life was over, just as it was meant to be, and while I was now out of ajob with no alternative income, I felt liberated. Working in the soulless mediahad become a daily nightmare and now I was free. I only survived these next fewyears financially because I lived well below my income from television and hadenough money in the bank to see me and my family through – just. It was a timewhen trusting the flow of life was a major challenge with everything I had builtnow falling all around me and it was about to get a whole lot worse. My thenwife Linda and my children were, of course, even more confused than I was. Atleast I had directly experienced the strange happenings; they knew only what Ihad told them. And here was their husband and father, a well-known face onnational television for eight years, suddenly out of a job, talking about weirdevents and ideas and soon to be publicly ridiculed on a scale rarely seen in allBritish media history. The fact that they stood by me and did not once waver intheir support no matter happened, was one of the key factors in my ability tosurvive what was about to unfold. So it was with my television agent, PaulVaughan, who never ceased to support me even when it would have been much easierfor him to walk away.My only desire was to follow the rapidly changing course of my life. Strange itall may have been, but there was a force within me that knew this was the way Ihad to go. Through the latter months of 1990 I wrote my first book about theseevents, Truth Vibrations.1 When it went to the printers just before theChristmas of 1990, the sequence began that led to the explosion in myconsciousness that changed almost everything I had ever thought or believed. Isuddenly had a tremendous urge to go to Peru, although I had no idea where thiscame from. I knew nothing about Peru and had never even thought about the placeuntil now. In this same period I kept seeing the word ‘Peru’ everywhere, onbooks, in newspapers and in travel agent windows. I met another psychic lady whosaid without any prompting from me: “Have you ever thought about visiting Peru?”She said I would be going there and “drinking of the holy waters”. This commentcame back to me a few weeks later when I was drinking water from the UrubambaRiver, the ‘holy river’, which flows through the Sacred Valley of Incas nearPeru’s ancient and formerly ‘lost’ city of Machu Picchu.Everything I was doing since I had those first communications through thepsychic was based purely on intuition. I didn’t know why I was going to Peru,for instance, only that I had to for some reason. My head, my ‘logic’, told methat I should not be spending money I could not afford to make such an expensivetrip, but by now my head was no match for my ‘heart’, from where our intuitive‘knowing’ communicates with us. I don’t mean the physical heart, but thespiritual one that can be felt in the centre of the chest. It is a vortex or‘chakra’ (meaning ‘wheel of light’) that connects the ‘physical’ level with ourhigher consciousness beyond the five-senses. This is the true origin to why thephysical heart is used today to symbolise love. It comes from a lostunderstanding of what the ‘heart’ really means in this context. When you feelgreat love or compassion notice how you feel it in the centre of the chest –that’s the heart chakra or vortex through which we also feel our intuitive‘knowing’. When someone is trying to make a decision we say: “What does yourheart tell you?” or “Does it feel right?” The heart chakra is our connection toour higher consciousness beyond this ‘world’ while our ‘head’, our conditionedmind, is caught in the trap of ‘thinking’ in accordance with the rules andregulations of the five-sense reality. Most people are imprisoned by their‘head’, which is indoctrinated to believe the official version of what is rightand wrong, moral and immoral, sane and insane: the ‘norms’ of society. This isan expression of the Earth-bound consciousness, the ‘lower’ or ‘five-sense’mind, that is daily manipulated to accept a version of reality and possibilitythat suits the agenda of those in control. It is based on limitation, rules andregulations and the “I can’t”, “you can’t”, mentality. It sees why somethingcannot be done or shouldn’t be done and rarely why it can or should. It is alsofrozen by fear and this holds humanity in a mental and emotional prison cell.The ‘heart’, the intuition, however, is our connection with the Infinite selfbeyond the five-senses. The ‘heart’ feels rather than thinks and it has‘knowing’ rather than second-hand ‘knowledge’ gleaned from the indoctrinationmachine. Most people have an inner ‘war’ going on between what they think andfeel – what their head tells them to do and what they intuitively feel to do.Almost every time the head is the winner. It is easier that way, or appears tobe, in a society founded on the imposition of thought and belief. Once the‘norms’ of society are decided and imposed by the system through ‘education’,‘science’, the media and so on, any rebels or freethinkers are subjected toridicule or condemnation (in my case both) for the crime of being different orchallenging this ludicrously limited version of reality and possibility. Thisprocess is captured superbly by a Japanese saying: “Don’t be the nail thatstands out above the rest because that’s the first one to get hit.”Anyone who seriously follows their intuitive ‘knowing’ rather than theirindoctrinated, fearful, head/mind is going to face the ridicule and condemnationof the psychological fascists. These are not only people in jackboots with sillymoustaches; they are our parents, ‘friends’, colleagues at work, and, if you arein the public eye, ‘journalists’ and the public in general. Anyone, in fact, whomakes it difficult or unpleasant to be different. Most of the human race is soutterly indoctrinated by the externally implanted ‘norms’ that bombard theirmind from cradle to grave that they have no comprehension that their ‘normal’thinking is their own individual and collective prison. Such is theirbewilderment they not only contribute minute by minute to the building of theirprison, they defend it ferociously from anyone who questions or challenges thefoundations and assumptions on which it stands. It is what I term the “flatEarth mentality”. When the norm was that the Earth was flat anyone who claimedit was round was subjected to ridicule and condemnation, even imprisonment anddeath. When the norm changed with the deluge of evidence to accept the Earth wasa sphere, the roles immediately reversed and anyone who claimed it was flat thengot the treatment. Norms rule, OK? Set the norms and you control humanperception and behaviour. This is why exposing norms for the nonsense they areis so important.Those who live life through their intuition always attract the attention of theThought Police because the ‘head’ and the ‘heart’, the lower ‘mind’ and thehigher consciousness, view reality from a completely different point ofobservation. I will get into this in detail later, but symbolically you couldput it like this: if the ‘five-sense’ mind was sailing down a river it couldonly see as far as the next bend. But the higher consciousness communicatingthrough the intuition would see the whole river from source to sea. It wouldknow what was coming and the most effective course of action at any given point.It would know if there was bad weather ahead and if it was best to stop whereyou are until it passes. It would know if you were heading for a massivewaterfall or if there were bandits lurking downstream and it could guide you toavoid them. None of this is available to the five-sense mind because it has sucha limited vision and ability to see beyond its perceived ‘norms’. “There is noevidence that there are waterfalls or rapids in this river”, it might say, “anduntil I see the proof we are going ooooon … aaaaaaahhhhh.” The five-sense minddisconnected from its higher consciousness is engaged in a constant and furiousbattle with the intuition because if it surrendered its reality to the higherone it would lose its perceived power over events and behaviour. If someone onthe boat said their intuition told them there were bandits around the corner,the lower minds of the others would ask them for the ‘proof’. They would be toldnot to be so stupid and to stop spoiling the trip. In the same way people haverefused to get on aircraft that were to crash because they had a ‘feeling’ –intuition from their higher consciousness. Even if these people had told theother passengers what they felt most would have still got on the plane becausetheir head would tell them the chances of crashing were miniscule and, anyway,they needed to get to their destination to attend a business meeting or make adinner date. Also, the great breakthroughs in understanding, including those inscience, are invariably the result of an intuition, a ‘gut feeling’, rather thanthe intellect working it all out. The intuitive is the inspiration and theintellect only confirms it.Daring to be differentWhen we follow our intuition we often find ourselves behaving in ways that theconditioned, imprisoned, lower minds of people around us find impossible tounderstand. Because of this they have to rationalise your words and behaviour tothemselves with claims that you are ‘mad’ or ‘dangerous’. In fact you are merelydifferent, viewing reality from a different point of observation. It is likethat scene with Robin Williams in the 1989 movie, Dead Poets Society (TouchstonePictures), when he told his pupils in the ‘norm’-dominated school:> “I stand up on my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things> in a different way.

I have never wavered fromthat to this day. As I was soon to find, this commitment to the intuitive canland you with serious challenges in a world that operates through head and mind.In the midst of such experiences the head is screaming at the heart: “I told youso!! Look what happens when you don’t listen to me!!” This is where most peoplepull back and return to the head, the experiment over. But when you stay with itand continue to follow your intuitive knowing in the face of all theconsequences that may follow, a wonderful, liberating, transformation begins tomanifest. The mind is judging events only by its perspective of seeing to thenext bend, but your intuition is viewing the entire river. It knows that whilethings might seem bad at this point, the experience is leading somewhere reallypositive a little downstream. This has happened to me constantly and never moreso than in the opening years of the 1990s. As a result of staying with myintuition no matter what, my lower or five-sense mind has been able to observe‘logically’ that while following your intuition can throw up enormouschallenges, the experience always turns out to be what was necessary from thebigger perspective. It sees that what seemed to be self destruction actuallyleads to a positive outcome that happens, not despite the ‘self-destructive’experience, but because of it. With this realisation the head/mind moves intoharmony with the intuition and the war between what you think and feel comes toan end. The two become the same. You follow your intuitive ‘knowing’ without thehead symbolically banging its fist on the table.“Did you have any dreams last night?”Purely on intuition I flew to Lima, Peru, at the start of February 1991 for theexperience that transformed my life. I had no idea why I was going, only that Ineeded to. When I walked off the plane at Lima Airport and collected my luggage,I was like a little boy lost. What now? I had a feeling to head for Cusco in theAndes, the centre of the ancient Inca civilisation, and I saw on the departureboard that a plane was leaving for there in around 35 minutes. But the airportwas a mass of people and I had yet to buy a ticket. No chance of getting thatflight, I thought. Then a Peruvian guy speaking pretty good English emergedthrough the crowd and asked me where I was going.“Cusco”, I said.“You have hotel?”“No.”“You have ticket?”“No.”“I get you ticket and hotel.”This he did in very quick time, taking his commission on the way, of course. Bynow the flight was close to leaving and I went to the back of a long linewaiting to check in. Again it was clearly impossible for me to make thedeparture time, now 20 minutes away. But as I prepared for a long wait, my fixersaid: “No, no, follow me.” He took me down to the front of the queue where hisfriend was on the check in. The friend immediately stopped what he was doing andbegan to check me onto the flight. Considerably less than an hour after landingin Lima I was walking back across the tarmac to board the plane to Cusco. Such‘coincidences’ were to be constantly repeated for the next three amazing weeksand, in fact, have continued ever since. I arrived at my rundown hotel and saton the bed wondering what to do next. Someone I had met a few days earlier hadgiven me the telephone number of a friend in Cusco and I made a call to see whatwould happen. She turned out to be the manager of a local travel agency andwithin an hour my basic travel plans and arrangements for the next two weekswere sorted. She also called a Peruvian guide she knew who would show me aroundthe country and the next day I arrived at his home to meet him and begin whatwas to be an incredible adventure. The door was open and I walked in to find himasleep on the floor. As he opened his eyes his first words were not hello orgood morning, but “did you have any dreams last night?” After recovering fromthe surprise of his opening remarks, I said that yes I had. The dream was veryvivid and included one of my front middle teeth falling out.“Is your father or grandfather still alive?” he asked.“Well yes, my father is, why?”“That dream is often symbolic of your father or grandfather dying.”Making an international phone call in Peru outside of Lima is far from easy,certainly then anyway, but a week later when I finally managed to ring home Ifound that my father had died at that time back in England. His funeral hadtaken place before I even knew he had died. I was to stay longer than planned inPeru and for the next three weeks as I travelled around much of the country, adaily sequence began to repeat itself. Each morning I would tell the guide whereI intuitively felt to go and he would invariably tell me it wasn’t possible. Butevery day we would somehow end up there. I went to some stunning locations, notjust the famous tourist sites like the extraordinary Machu Picchu, but manyother unforgettable places. Eventually we arrived in a town in southern Perucalled Puno, not far from Lake Titicaca. The guide had booked us in a hotelcalled the Sillustani, named after an ancient Inca site about an hour’s driveaway. For obvious reasons there were pictures of the place around the hotel andI told the guide I wanted to go there. True to form he said it was not possibleat that time of year without spending a lot of money, but my intuition to go wasso strong that I said I would do whatever was necessary. I had to hire a touristmini-bus for myself (or so the guide told me) and off I went with him and thedriver.“It will be over when you feel the rain”The Sillustani ruins are located on a hill skirted on three sides by a beautifullagoon. The area was uninhabited and surrounded by distant mountains. It wasquiet with only a couple of children waiting with a lama hoping to sellphotographs to tourists. But there weren’t any, apart from me. After I walkedaround the ruins for an hour or so under the piercing Peruvian Sun, I went backto the tourist bus to return to Puno. I thought the trip was over and I feltdeflated and disappointed because, lovely as this place was, what I hadexperienced did not begin to match the power of the intuition I had to go there.About three minutes down the road I was daydreaming out of the window when I sawa mound to the right. It caught my attention and as I looked at the mound, avoice in my head began to repeat: “Come to me, come to me, come to me.” What?That mound is talking to me?? I asked the driver to stop the bus and said I wasgoing to walk up the mound. “I’ll only be a few minutes”, I said. Although Icouldn’t see it from the road, at the top of the mound there was a circle ofstanding stones about waist high and they had clearly been there a long time. Istood in the centre of the circle looking back across to Sillustani and themountains way off in the distance. There was not a cloud in the sky and the Sunwas extremely hot, burning my face. Suddenly, I felt my feet being pulled likemagnets into the ground again. It was the same as in the newspaper shop in Ryde,but this time it was far more powerful. My arms then reached up above my headwithout any conscious decision from me. If you put your arms above your head,slightly outwards at about 45 degrees you’ll see how they start to ache within aminute. My arms were like that for well over an hour and I felt nothing until itwas over and then my shoulders were agony. I felt like a drill sensation in thetop of my head and I could feel a flow of energy going the other way up from theground through my feet and out through the top my head. I heard a voice in mymind that said, “They will be talking about this moment a hundred years fromnow” and then “It will be over when you feel the rain.” What was that aboutrain? What bloody rain? There was not a cloud to be seen anywhere, just abrilliant Sun in a clear blue sky. What was happening to me?I stood there unable to move as the energy increased to the point where my bodywas shaking as if plugged into an electrical socket. Time became meaningless;there was no ‘time’ as we perceive it, no past, no future, only the moment I wasexperiencing. I kept moving in and out of conscious awareness, much like youdrive a car and wonder where the last few miles have gone. The car has beendriven by your subconscious while the conscious was off in a daydream. In one ofmy returns to awareness I saw there was a light grey mist over the distantmountains and as I watched it got darker and darker. My god, it was raining overthere, although far away. Soon the rain clouds emerged from the mountains withridiculous speed. I can only describe it as like pulling a curtain across thesky as a straight line of cloud moved towards me covering the Sun. When it camecloser I was seeing faces in the clouds, billowing like dry ice in a stage show.By now my body was shaking so fiercely from the energy passing through me that Icould hardly stand. Eventually the clouds were overhead and it began to rain. AsI felt the water on my face the surges of energy stopped as if a switch had beenflicked. I staggered forward, my legs like jelly, my shoulder and arm musclesnow stiff and painful. It was only at this point that I noticed that thePeruvian guide was standing next to the circle, tired of waiting for me in thebus. If a facial expression ever said “mad Englishman”, his was it. Energy waspouring from my hands with tremendous power and I went down to the bus to grab acrystal in an effort to diffuse some of it. I only had the crystal because I hadwalked into a shop in Glastonbury, England, two weeks before and the owner hadjust picked it up and given it to me for free. “I think you should have this”,he said. My feet also continued to burn and vibrate for some 24 hours. I couldhardly sleep that night because of it.The next day I arrived at an astonishing place called Sun Island in LakeTiticaca, which spans the Peruvian and Bolivian borders and is claimed to be thehighest navigable lake in the world at some 13,000 feet. According to legend,Sun Island and nearby Moon Island were the birthplace of the Sun and Moon andthese bodies took human form as the first Inca, Manco Capac and his sister-wifeMama Ocllo. There is no electricity on the island and without the visualpollution of neon light the stars appear so close and in such incredibleclarity. I stepped out of the little fishing boat and onto the shore, stilltrying to make sense of what had happened to me on that mound. There I met ablonde Argentine lady who had been in La Paz, Bolivia, the day before when shehad felt strongly that she had to go to Sun Island. She arrived only half anhour before I did. When I shook her hand to say hello she wouldn’t let go and,although she couldn’t speak English, she made gestures to my hand sayingsomething like “What’s this I can feel?” What was she talking about? What couldshe feel? What had happened to me on that mound? For sure in the weeks thatfollowed my life and perceptions went through a transformation that took me tothe limits of mental and emotional survival. It was like a dam had burst in myconsciousness. The five-sense mind was suddenly flooded with new perceptions,thoughts and ideas and it was just too much to process at once, and make anysense of it.“He thinks he’s Jesus”Unfortunately for my short-term self-respect, but perfect for my long-termawakening, my book Truth Vibrations was published in early 1991 in precisely theperiod when I could hardly tell you what planet I was on. The book and my publicbehaviour and statements led to unimaginable national ridicule blasted acrossthe front pages of the newspapers and on television and radio programmes galore.I could literally not walk down any street in Britain without being ridiculed bythe people. I lived my life at this time to the sound of laughter. Going into abar? Forget it. There was uproar. I would stop at traffic lights and look acrossto see whole families laughing at me in the car alongside and televisioncomedians only had to say my name to trigger riotous laughter. My children werelaughed at in the street and at school and they were followed by tabloidjournalists trying to dig the dirt. One freelance ‘journalist’ on the Isle ofWight was especially appalling, gleefully taking money from the tabloids to dotheir dirty work while claiming to be my ‘friend’.The hysteria reached its peak when I appeared on a live prime-time televisionchat show hosted by Britain’s then best-known TV ‘personality’, Terry Wogan. Hehas since said publicly that he regrets how he handled the interview, which wasbig of him, really. But at the time he took the ridicule route. Such was thepublicity in the media that the Wogan show audience were laughing within aminute or so of me sitting down and that pretty much continued for the whole ofthe interview. I became famous for wearing turquoise clothes because after theexperience on the mound I began to want to wear only turquoise, which is a verypowerful and sacred colour to many native and esoteric beliefs. Native Americansare one major example of this. Years later when I met my now great friend, CredoMutwa, a ‘Sanusi’ or shaman and the official historian of the Zulu nation inSouth Africa, he was decked from neck to toe in brilliant turquoise. At the timeI knew nothing of the esoteric meaning of turquoise, only that I felt stronglyto wear it. Funny, some of the media could not even get that right and manyarticles reported my obsession with “purple”. The other foundation of theridicule was that I had supposed to have called myself the Son of God, implyingthat I was Jesus or something. Ironically ‘Jesus’ is a ‘man’ I have no doubt didnot exist as depicted by Christianity, as I have explained in detail in some ofmy books. I used the term ‘Son of God’ in the sense of being an aspect, as Iunderstood it at the time, of the Infinite consciousness that is everything. AsI have written before, we are like droplets of water in an ocean of infiniteconsciousness. We are ‘individual’ on one level, but also part of the infinitewhole. More than that, we are the infinite whole as I shall later explain. I wasnot trying to say I had come to save the world or anything, only that, likeeveryone and everything else in all existence, I was an aspect of the Infiniteand not just a physical ‘personality’.If you call the Infinite consciousness ‘God’, I was trying to say, we are allthe symbolic ‘sons’ and ‘daughters’ of ‘God’. Obviously my awareness of thesematters has increased dramatically since then, but that was the basis of mycomments about being a ‘Son of God’. However, I was both misrepresented in themedia and, with my mind downloading so much information following the mound inPeru, I wasn’t grounded or ‘here’ enough to articulate clearly what I was tryingto say and this led to even greater misrepresentation and misunderstanding amongthose who ridiculed and laughed. All I can say to ‘Jesus’ is that if you arethere, mate, don’t for goodness sake come back because they’ll bloody crucifyyou – Christians as much as anyone. If you do return I would definitely do thecloud trick to give yourself any chance at all. Some comedians were funny ratherthan vindictive, though, and I recall the brilliant British comic, JasperCarrot, saying that I couldn’t be the Son of God because you’d never find threewise men and virgin in Leicester. My children were in hysterics when he wastalking about me because it was done with good humour and wit.In two mindsI remember clearly being aware during the Wogan interview of two very differentlevels of myself, what I now know to have been the lower mind caught in theconditioned illusions of this five-sense ‘world’ and my infinite consciousnessthat was observing these events from a very much higher perspective of knowing.The head/mind is the experiencer of this dense frequency range and, if the headlistens to the heart, the higher consciousness is the intuitive ‘guide’ thatobserves this realm from beyond its prison walls and manipulated illusions. Itis my experiencer level that dislikes the public spotlight and my higherconsciousness that is totally at peace with talking off the cuff for hours toany number of people you care to assemble. While the audience were laughing atme on the Wogan show my five-sense mind, the illusory ‘personality’ called‘David Icke’, was in emotional turmoil and agony. But there was another level ofme I also recall very clearly. It was saying: “It’s OK, everything is fine, thisis leading somewhere, don’t worry.” Many times I had a major problem believingthese words, I must say, but so it has proved to be. I understand why peoplethought I had self-destructed and why, even now with the gathering recognitionmy books are enjoying, that the ‘turquoise’, ‘Son of God’, period is seen as anunfortunate disaster that has made my subsequent work far more difficult interms of public credibility in Britain. But such people miss the point. Thisperiod of unbelievable ridicule did not make my subsequent work more difficult;it made it possible.Ridiculed to freedomHere again we have the two perspectives of the lower conditioned mind and thehigher consciousness that communicates through intuition and knowing. Thefive-sense mind can see a few paragraphs on one page while the higherconsciousness has read the book. In fact, it has written it. To do what I was todo years down the line I had to free myself from the prison that almost everyoneon the planet lives in every day. It is a prison that disconnects lower mindfrom Infinite self and the one that daily holds humanity in slavery to a systemcreated and orchestrated by the few to this very end. It is the fear of whatother people think. Most people are not living the lives they want to lead orspeaking their own undiluted truths because they are frightened of the reactionof others – parents, teachers, ‘friends’ and neighbours if their views andlifestyle are at odds with the ‘norms’ on which this lunatic asylum is founded.They keep their heads down and their mouths shut – “Don’t be the nail thatstands out above the rest because that’s the first one to get hit.” In short,they are not living their truth or expressing their uniqueness and desires; theyare conforming to what society and its parent, teacher, ‘friend’ and neighbourThought Police dictate should be the limits of their lives and views. How couldI write and talk about the challenging and often ‘bizarre’ concepts in my booksif I still cared what anyone thought of me? Impossible. I would be editinginformation, even leaving out great swathes altogether, because of my concernwith what others would think. Thanks to that onslaught of ridicule in the early1990s the prison door opened. I was going to speak my unfiltered truth and ifpeople didn’t like it, well that’s just too bad. They must believe somethingelse then, it’s all the same with me. When you are faced with the level ofridicule that I endured year after year, you either go under and have abreakdown, or you ditch any concern with what other people think of you and havea breakthrough. You walk out of the sheep pen into the light of freedom. Theridicule may have been a nightmare at the time to my insecure lower mind, but myhigher consciousness knew why it had to happen. It was to set me free. As that‘psychic’ communication said in the earliest days of my awakening:> “True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive,> but it will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you> receive whether you like it or not. Ponder on anything you do not like and see> if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much> easier.” So what was going on?It was many months before I began to understand what had happened to me and howit was happening to countless other people away from the public glare. I hadexperienced a monumental ‘kundalini’ explosion. As I said earlier, the‘physical’ body is connected to its other energy ‘bodies’ beyond the five-sensedomain by those spinning vortexes known as ‘chakras’ from the ancient Sanskritword meaning wheels of light. We have these all over the body, but there areseven main ones, as illustrated in Figure 1. Each chakra represents a differentlevel of being. For instance, the one in the solar plexus is the connection toour emotional level and this is why we feel emotions like fear and worry in thebelly. We call it having “butterflies in the tummy” or “getting the shits”, butreally the sensation is coming from the solar plexus chakra. The chakrasinter-connect with the physical body through the endocrine system and thevibrational state of the chakra effects the body in infinite ways. The balancepoint of the three lower (‘physical’) chakras and the three higher (mental andspiritual) ones is the heart chakra. It is from here that we can balance thephysical and non-physical levels of being and this is our connection to ourhighest levels of intuitive knowing. A kundalini experience is when tremendouslypowerful energy is released through the base chakra at the bottom of the spine.This process is described by Itzhak Bentov in his book, Stalking the WildPendulum:2> “The kundalini, as described in yoga literature, is said to be an ‘energy> coiled up, like a serpent, at the base of the spine’. When this energy is> ‘awakened’, it enters the spine, rises up along it, and is seen or perceived> as a luminous serpent by the person having the experience. Once it has risen> into the head, the luminous rod hopefully pierces the top of the head; that> is, the rod-like energy beam is seen as projecting through the skull pointing> upward. When this happens, the person is said to be ‘illuminated’. Eventually,> such a person may become highly intuitive and develop some psychic powers,> such as clairvoyance, clairaudience or healing abilities.”3 Img [../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 1: The human ‘chakra’ or vortex system that interpenetrates our levels ofbeing. The balance point is the heart chakra and when that is closed orimbalanced we disconnect from our Infinite Self and become dominated by the‘five-sense’ mind. This is what happened to me. It was the cause of my ‘dam burst’ and the processbegan on the mound in Peru. The kundalini exploded up through my spine,activating all the chakras and my brain into a higher level of contact with theocean of infinite consciousness. With that initial explosion came the apparentchaos in my mind as I was transforming from one energy state to another. It wasthis activation that caused me to suddenly see the world and myself in a totallydifferent way and my mind was bombarded with information and concepts I couldnot process for months. I felt like a computer that had locked up because toomany keys had been pressed at once. This was my state on the Wogan show andpublic ignorance of these matters led me to be labelled “mad”. This is thenormal defence response to anyone who is significantly different and I was nowseriously different. As Angela Monet said: “Those who danced were thought to bequite insane by those who could not hear the music.” What they called madnesswas really transformation. Itzhak Bentov points out that the psychologicalsymptoms of the more extreme kundalini experience (and mine was) “tend to mimicschizophrenia” and many people are sent to mental institutions because ‘modern’medicine does not understand what is happening. He goes on:> “It is ironic that persons in whom the evolutionary processes of Nature have> begun to operate more rapidly, and who can be considered as advanced mutants> of the human race, are institutionalised as subnormal by their ‘normal’ peers.> I dare to guess, on the basis of discussions with my psychiatrist-friends,> that this process is not as exotic and rare as one would like us to believe,> and possibly 25 to 30 per cent of all institutionalised schizophrenics belong> to this category – a tremendous waste of human potential.” 4 Bentov says that the diagnosis of ‘schizophrenia’ stems from the kundaliniactivation of other levels of awareness:> “The reason for this is that they have been catapulted suddenly into a> situation in which they are functioning in more than one reality. They can see> and hear things occurring in our neighbouring realities, that is the astral or> other higher realities, because their ‘frequency response’ has been broadened> … The onslaught of information may be overwhelming, and they begin to mix and> confuse two or three realities.” 5 I went through this process in public without understanding what the hell washappening to me. When eventually the nature and effects of the kundaliniawakening were explained, it made complete sense of what I had experienced,although the emotional debris around me was no less painful.The inner eyes openFor months after my mental and emotional ‘dam’ exploded, my life was in chaos.On every level there was turmoil and I said and did many things that the DavidIcke people thought they knew would never have contemplated. It was all reportedacross the front pages of the national newspapers and by the end of thisexperience there was little left of my old life and identity. Every bridge tothe ‘past’ was ablaze and there was no going back. Not that I wanted to. A messas my life seemed to be, something inside drove me on. I was not going to run. Iknew that this was all meant to be, but why and to what end? After about threemonths the storm in my mind began to subside and I became ‘normal’ once again.Well, on the surface I did. Inside I was transformed. What happened to me onthat mound in Peru began to integrate with that level known as ‘David Icke’ andI realised that I could see so much that I hadn’t seen before. I was lookingthrough the same eyes and hearing through the same ears, but what I saw andheard were dramatically different. I began to see beyond the movie, theconditioned version of reality that those in power sell us as the ‘truth’. Icould see the manipulation with an increasing clarity and, as my understandingexpanded, I could see that the world was not just a little bit different to whatwe had been led to believe. It was nothing like it. The ‘world’ we thought to bereal was simply a manufactured illusion. But why and by whom or by what?In mid-1991 my feet were back on the ground, but, of course, all the public andmedia remembered were the crazy days of my very public transition. Once you arelabelled and placed in the pigeonhole, that’s it. Once ‘crazy’ always ‘crazy’,black and white, no shades of grey. The ridicule and laughter continued whereverI went and the ‘normal’ course of action would have been to keep my head down.Instead I embarked on a speaking tour of British universities, aware of what myreception would be. Did I want to go? Of course not (five-sense mind). Did Iknow it was necessary? Yes (Infinite consciousness). The events were sold outsometimes weeks in advance because these ‘decision makers of tomorrow’ came tolaugh and ridicule. One night it was 15 minutes before I could start to speakbecause of the uproar, noise and beer cups thrown at the stage. I waited forthis to die down and then I said:“You think I’m mentally ill, don’t you?”“YEEEEESSS,” came the collective reply.“So what does that say about you then? You have paid to ridicule someone youhave been conditioned to believe is mentally ill?”You could hear a pin drop. It had dawned on them that their behaviour was not astatement about me, but about them. It is a revelation we would all do well toremember: what we do and say is not a reflection of those we ridicule andcondemn, but of ourselves. I was heard in respectful silence for the rest ofthat night, apart from a small group at the back near the bar who continued toheckle in the darkness. I asked for the lights to be switched on so everyonecould see where the noise was coming from and I asked for a microphone to betaken to the group so they could say what they wanted to say in the full view ofthe audience. You would have thought the mike was on fire such was the vehemenceof their refusal to take it. These talks to university students showed me somuch about myself and also the conditioned human responses that imprison bothperpetrators and their targets. It confirmed that I had purged my concern withwhat other people thought of me because no matter how I was received I reallydidn’t give a damn any more. What a freedom that is. I began to see what anillusion I was living in and how the entire human race, except for a few, wascaught in a virtual reality game that dictated the rules. I had to smile tomyself in this period whenever I was interviewed by a British TV host calledEamonn Holmes, a guy I knew from my days in television. He could not get hishead around why anyone would give up a successful career in TV to do what I haddone. The fact that television was not the be all and end all of life, or thatsuch a version of ‘success’ was illusory, seemed beyond his comprehension: “Butyou could still be in television”. Yes, Eamonn, but I don’t want to be, mate.“But …”Right ‘time’, right ‘place’Those first ‘psychic’ communications in 1990 have proved to be prophecy indeed,not least the one about “knowledge will be put into his mind, and at other timeshe will be led to knowledge.” I embarked upon a daily journey of oftenstaggering synchronicity in which I would meet people or have experiences thatwould continually increase my appreciation of what was actually going on in theworld and the nature of life itself. Alongside this have been the thoughts thathave suddenly appeared in my mind about people and events that later are shownby hindsight or ‘five-sense’ research to have been correct. I have been guidedwith a synchronistic precision that is often breathtaking. Without this, I couldnever have compiled so much information and made so many connections so quickly.There is a force that wants to open the mind of humanity, that’s for sure. Ithas certainly opened mine and I am passing on what I discover to those who wishto hear.I’ll give you one example of the outrageous ‘coincidences’ that have becomecommonplace since the mound in Peru. By mid-1995 I had completed the manuscriptfor And The Truth Shall Set You Free in which I had mentioned quite extensivelythe background to former US President Jimmy Carter. As the book was about to goto press I travelled to Ireland to see the brilliant show called Riverdance atthe Point Theatre in Dublin. The tickets were bought through the box office likeeveryone else and I walked up the steps into the arena to find my seat. I had afriend who worked on the show and when I reached the top of the steps I wassurprised to see her standing there. She was looking bewildered and bemused. Shesaid she should have been backstage, but had felt intuitively to come and waitfor me. While she waited she had overheard a security guard say the “securityseats” were row S numbers 25, 26, 27 and 28. I could now understand why she wasbemused because she knew from an earlier conversation that the tickets for amutual friend and me were row S 25 and 26. I was in the ‘security’ seats? Whatwas going on? She also said that she had never seen these security people beforebecause they were not the ones that normally worked at the theatre.I decided to go to the seats and see what happened. By now it was only minutesto the start of the show and the arena was packed, but when I reached row S itwas empty from end to end. Spooky. I sat down with the mutual friend andsuddenly the people in front of us began to turn around and look to the back ofthe theatre. When I looked I could see a ring of heavies coming down the stairssurrounding someone and there were flash cameras going off like machine gun fireamong the audience. Clearly someone famous was involved here. This entouragethen stopped at the far end of my empty row and the people inside the circle ofsecurity men began to walk towards me. As they got closer I could see that itwas President Jimmy Carter and his wife who proceeded to sit down beside me inthe other two security seats! Unbelievable. According to the newspapers I readthe next day, Carter was in Ireland to meet with the then Irish President, MaryRobinson, and had taken the opportunity to see Riverdance. And here were he andhis wife sitting next to me in ‘security seats’ when my tickets had been boughtin the same way as every other member of the audience that night and no-one atthe theatre knew who they were for. I stood up and shook Carter’s hand becausesomething urged me to look into his eyes. To my astonishment, and I can onlydescribe this from my own experience, it was like looking into an empty shell.It seemed to me that there was no one home and it was a weird experience. Iresisted the urge to tell him I had a book out soon that he might like to read.I sat there contemplating the hilarious thought that here I was sitting insecurity seats next to an American president I was exposing in my books whilesurrounded by CIA security men. I couldn’t watch the show for a while because Iwas laughing so much. Higher consciousness, as I have experienced many times,has a terrific sense of humour. This is the kind of ‘coincidence’ that hashappened constantly since I began to follow my heart in 1990 and investigatewhat was really happening in this world, who was really in control and to whatend. When people ask how I have compiled so much information on these subjects,this is how. I don’t have to look for it; it comes to me. As I was told in thoseearly days:> “Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only> have to follow the clues … We are guiding you along a set path … It was all> organised before you incarnated.” This is not to say it is easy. It takes a tremendous amount of work andcommitment and some days my head could explode with all the information thatneeds to be processed, assimilated and fitted together. But it is this guidingforce that makes it possible to lift a veil of secrecy that is desperate toremain hidden from public view and has managed to be so for thousands of years.On my part it has been vital that I have followed my intuition at all timesbecause that is the means through which the higher consciousness ‘speaks’ to allof us if we are prepared to listen. If my intuition says I must go here, dosomething or meet a person, this is what I do. No questions, no consultationswith the ‘logical’ head, I just do it. There is always a good reason, eitherobviously at the time or with hindsight, for why that action was necessary.Upward and onwardThe big audiences that came to ridicule me in the immediate aftermath of the‘turquoise period’ soon drifted away once it became clear that there wasactually nothing to laugh at when the information was explained at length. Foryears after that I would speak to a handful of people in small, cold, halls andleave poorer than when I arrived because income from the ‘audience’ rarelymatched the expenses of the event. At the same time I heard people say that Iwas “only doing it for the money”. My determination to continue was seriouslychallenged in this period, I can tell you. It all seemed so pointless, but thatinner ‘knowing’ never left me and constantly assured me that all would be well.So it has turned out. Even when I was earning little or no money through most ofthe 1990s I managed through out-of-the-blue invitations to visit more than 40countries. This helped me to compile an increasingly vast library of informationabout the background, methods and personnel behind the global manipulation thatI had begun to see was no wacky ‘theory’, as portrayed by the media. At firstthe information was mostly about the manipulation of the ‘five-sense’ reality –the one we daily experience. It was about names, dates, people and the secretconnections between the apparently unconnected. Later the journey revealed to methe other-dimensional expression of the manipulation and I realised that themanipulators in physical ‘bodies’ are pawns of a force that most people cannotsee with the severe limitations of the human senses.I have written a long series of books through these years since the publicationof Truth Vibrations. They include Heal the World, Days of Decision, The Robots’Rebellion, And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I Am Me I Am Free, The BiggestSecret, Children of the Matrix and Alice in Wonderland and the World TradeCenter Disaster, Why the Official Story of 9/11 is a Monumental Lie. Especiallysince the publication of The Biggest Secret in 1999, there has been a gatheringof interest in what I am communicating. My website, www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com], attracts millions of visits a month and my talks allover the world enjoy large and rapidly-growing attendances. It is all a long wayfrom the time I spoke at a venue near Chicago to eight people or had to cancelevents to avoid having to talk to myself. People are beginning to wake up and Ihave almost been a barometer of this with the interest in my own work. One ofthe first things I was told about in 1990, in fact the very theme of TruthVibrations, was that a transformation, an awakening, of human consciousness wasupon us and I can now see this manifesting more obviously every day. It is notthe majority yet, but we are getting there. Minds, or more importantly hearts,are opening to a truth that we all know, but have been manipulated to forget.I will now describe the multi-levels of the global and cosmic conspiracy as theyhave been revealed to me since the mound in Peru. Firstly, I was led to thefive-sense information of how the world we see is being manipulated towards aglobal fascist state; this was followed with the revelations about theother-dimensional control of the five-sense manipulators; and then, in theAmazon rainforest in 2003, I was shown how and why our daily experience is onlya dream of our own making. It was in Brazil that my mind was opened to an evengreater appreciation of the human plight and the amazing transformation that isgoing to take us home. This knowledge is the key to our freedom and I will gointo that in considerable detail later.SOURCES > 1 Truth Vibrations was published by Aquarian Press in 1991 and by Gateway> Books from 1993> 2 Itzhak Bentov, Stalking the Wild Pendulum (Destiny Books, Vermont, 1988)> 3 Ibid, p 176> 4 Ibid, p 175> 5 Ibid, p 183"},{"pageContent":"LEVEL ONE The five-senseconspiracy "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOWeb of deception > The most dangerous man, to any government, is the man who is able to think> things out for himself ...

Mencken, American Writer 1880-1956 To understand the background to current and historical world events, includingwhat happened on September 11th 2001, I have had to research and understand somany subjects, some of them considered bizarre or crazy to our conditionedreality.As the puzzle pieces began to emerge, it became clear that a network ofinterbreeding bloodlines going back to the ancient world has expanded itscontrol over the human population, until today a full-blown global dictatorshipis within its sight and within its grasp. Or at least it would be if theawakening of the human heart and mind were not about to blow the house down.Unless people know the real background to what is happening they can easily bedeceived by the official versions of 9/11 and other atrocities, wars, famine andstrife that are daily ‘reported’ by the media. The official story of September11th is a monumental lie, as I reveal in Alice in Wonderland and the World TradeCenter Disaster, but most people have believed it, and the wars of conquest thathave followed have been ‘justified’ by the official version being true. This hasincluded the deaths of at least five thousand Afghan civilians at the time ofwriting. These were men, women and children, like those who live in your street,who were slaughtered by US and British bombing to “get Bin Laden” – the man whowas supposed to have organised 9/11 from a cave in Afghanistan. It’s a lie, butthe lie was believed and, therefore, led to the reaction that killed and maimedstill more people in the name of ‘peace’ and ‘justice’. Some idiot interviewersin the mainstream media have asked me what was the point of people knowing whatis going on. Well, if the public realised who the true perpetrators of 9/11really were we would not have had our freedoms destroyed by the day since thoseplanes hit, and thousands of civilians in Afghanistan would still be with us.Nor would we have had the invasion of Iraq with hundreds of thousands ofcivilians killed and maimed, if the people had known the true background to whythat happened.From Strand to webPeople come into an understanding about the global conspiracy through manydifferent routes. Some begin to investigate the legalised corruption and theftorchestrated through the banking system and go on to see that this is just onestrand of an enormous conspiracy that pervades all areas of human life. Otherscome to this knowledge by researching the suppression of information about‘UFOs’ or the corruption of governments, arms sales, ‘Third World’ debt and theactions of transnational corporations that lead to death, hunger and sufferingacross Africa, Central and South America and elsewhere. If you pursue any ofthese investigations far enough, and with an open mind, it will inevitably leadyou into the enormous spider’s web of inter-connected and coordinatedmanipulation, mass murder and corruption that is the global conspiracy.I was guided into this understanding by the desire to know why alternativeexplanations for life were being suppressed while the versions presented by‘science’ and religion were given free reign. When my awakening began to expressitself I realised there were explanations that challenged those of ‘science’ andreligion and made far more sense in solving the ‘mysteries’ of life. Why wasthis information not made available to children and students in the schools anduniversities? Where were the television programmes about these concepts in themainstream media? Why was anyone who talked about them either ridiculed by‘science’ or condemned by ‘religion’? As my investigations continued a wholeuniverse of knowledge began to be unleashed as I realised that the suppressionof the very nature of our existence was a part, a fundamental part, of a globalconspiracy of simply astonishing proportions. I found myself involved in yearsof highly detailed and painstaking research on which I would often spend eighthours or more a day, week after week, month after month. That’s how well hiddenthe conspiracy has been – but not any longer. Before we move on to the specificsof current events, I will outline the basic background to the five-sensemanipulation. You can find the sources and far more information and detail in mybooks: And The Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret, Children of theMatrix and Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster.‘Illuminated ones’The conspiracy to create a centralised global fascist state is orchestrated inthe five-sense ‘world’ by a secret network known collectively as the Illuminatior ‘Illuminated ones’. They manipulate through secret societies and groupingslike the Freemasons, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar and the Jesuits. Theseand others feed carefully chosen recruits into the Illuminati and they areinstalled in positions of power throughout the world, infesting all colours,races, creeds and countries. It is not that everyone in the secret societies isaware of the plot; the overwhelming majority are not. The Illuminati operatelike a cancer to infiltrate and covertly control other organisations. MostFreemasons never progress higher than the bottom three levels of degree, theso-called Blue Degrees and they don’t realise what their organisation is beingused for. This was confirmed by Albert Pike, one of the most pre-eminent figuresin world Freemasonry who died in 1891. Among his titles were Sovereign GrandCommander of the Supreme Council of the 33rd degree and Supreme Pontiff ofUniversal Freemasonry. In his book, Morals and Dogma,1 written for higher-degreeFreemasons, he reveals the way the lower levels are misled:> “The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of> the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally> misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand> them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them. Their> true implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.” 2 Even most of those who make it to the apparently highest level, like the 33rddegree in the Scottish Rite, can know relatively little unless they are‘chosen’. Only the tiny few, all from particular bloodlines and their offshoots,progress through the official peak of their ‘individual’ secret society into theIlluminati degrees above that. I reckon some 95% of Freemasons are not awarethat these levels exist, never mind who is in them and what happens there.Illuminati operatives are manipulated into the positions of power and influenceto introduce the agenda for global domination. It is actually remarkable how fewpeople you need to directly control in order to dictate your agenda through thewhole system. It can be done if they are (a) in the key positions ofdecision-making and (b) they have the power to appoint those in the importantpositions below them. An example: you control the chief of police who decidesthe policy and he can appoint the heads of the various departments in his force.He introduces Illuminati policy and chooses his major subordinates from secretsociety initiates. They, in turn, can appoint the people within theirdepartments, and can choose more secret society initiates for the positionsbelow them. So it goes on. Once you have control of the top man in anyorganisation, the pyramid is built in his, i.e. the Illuminati’s, image.Governments are structured in the same way, as are ‘security’ organisations likethe FBI, CIA, British Intelligence and those who control the Pentagon.The need for centralisation is obvious. If there are only a relatively fewmanipulators compared with the target population, they have to centralisedecision making affecting the lives and choices of the many. The more diversethe decision making, the less control the few are going to have over what isdecided. It is like a guy on a stage with lots of plates spinning on sticks.Eventually he is going to lose control running around from one to the other andthe plates will begin to crash around him. It would be so much easier if he onlyhad ‘one big plate’ on ‘one big stick’ because he could keep that goingindefinitely. Diversity is the controllers’ nightmare and they have sought tocentralise decision-making and increase their power. The reason thatcentralisation in all areas of our lives, political, economic, business,military and media, has progressed with a faster and faster pace is anothersimple equation. The more you centralise power the more power you have tocentralise even quicker. The Illuminati want a world government, army, centralbank and currency that will dictate to a microchipped population (Figure 2). Theworld government would make all the major decisions politically, financially andmilitarily and enforce their introduction in every country. We are nowwitnessing the formation of this structure through the United Statesdictatorship. This is officially headed by George W. Bush, but it is reallycontrolled by the Illuminati hierarchy. America is their major vehicle forglobal conquest, as it was always planned to be. The ‘war on terrorism’ is amanufactured excuse to take over any country they can demonise through theirtruly pathetic mainstream media. The Left in politics, which has long ridiculedand even condemned what I say about the conspiracy, has now discovered thebrutal policy of ‘globalisation’. This involves bringing down trade barriers toallow the Illuminati multinationals to produce their products for pennies in thepoorest countries by paying the employees poverty wages, and then shipping themto the rich West (rich for some) and selling them at a vast, obscene profit. TheLeft limit their explanations of this to simply greedy giant corporationswanting more power and money. I understand this limitation of vision because theLeft, too, are caught in the system’s game while believing they are rebellingagainst it. But globalisation is really an expression of the Illuminati agendafor the global state in which everything will be dictated by the few at thecentre and any dissenter countries will get the treatment of Afghanistan, Iraqand others as the fodder troops are sent in to ‘liberate’ them.Image [../Images/00007.jpg]Figure 2: The Illuminati structure for global fascist government.‘Globalisation’ and the ‘war on terrorism’ are the agenda advancing to this end Blood brothersThe Illuminati can be traced back thousands of years to Sumer, Babylon, Egyptand still further into what we call pre-history. Through the centuries they havebeen working constantly to centralise global power and complete their ‘GreatWork’ – global dictatorship. Behind the apparent randomness of world events hasbeen the Illuminati secret network that is privy to knowledge the rest of thepeople never hear about. The network is controlled by ancient interbreedingbloodlines and their offshoots headed today by some thirteen ‘elite families’,which are structured in a DNA hierarchy. These include the Rothschilds,Rockefellers, House of Lorraine, Habsburgs and the Thurn und Taxis dynasty fromBergamo, Italy, which expanded into Belgium, Bavaria and wider afield. The Thurnund Taxis bloodline is highly significant to the Illuminati although notmentioned by researchers as often as some of the others. The bloodlines areoften referred to as the Black Nobility. These families that control the systemthat controls the people have a different DNA to the rest of the population. TheDNA is the blueprint for our physical traits and much more. Contacts who haveexperienced some of the inner levels of the conspiracy have described this to meas a DNA ‘corruption’. This ‘corruption’ will be barely, if at all, perceptibleat the level of DNA knowledge currently available because, frankly, humanscience knows damn all about DNA compared with what there is to know. It is thisDNA difference that led to the age-old claims by ‘royal’ bloodlines around theworld of their ‘Divine right to rule’. This ‘Divine right’ is simply the rightto rule by DNA. We have a head of state in Britain to this day who is only therebecause of her DNA and the whole freeloading hierarchy of the royal family isstructured according to a person’s DNA relationship to the king or queen. It isall based on their genetics and this is written into the law of the land thatalso condemns racism and makes it a criminal offence!!! But what is royal ruleby DNA if not outrageous racial and genetic elitism?This ‘Divine’ right to rule has nothing to do with the ‘Divine’ and everythingto do with the real origin of these bloodlines. They claim to descend from the‘gods’ of the ancient world and who or what these ‘gods’ were – and are – I willexplain in detail later. The ‘royal’ families have interbred incessantly witheach other since ancient times because they are seeking to retain the DNAcorruption that can apparently be quickly diluted by breeding outside of itself.How interesting that the families of the Illuminati and the power elite do thesame to this day. Why? They are the same bloodlines. The royal ‘Divine’bloodlines of ancient Sumer and Babylon (now Iraq), Egypt, the Indus Valley andelsewhere expanded into Europe to become the royal and aristocratic familiesthat ruled that continent and most of the world through the British Empire andthose of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and so on. As the peoplebegan to challenge and reject the open dictatorship of royal rule the bloodlinesbegan to move ‘underground’ by operating among the population in all the areasthat control modern society.Some researchers talk of one ‘royal’ bloodline originating from one place –often ancient Egypt. I don’t agree with that. Egypt is enormously important tothe Illuminati bloodlines for sure, but they were seeded in many parts of theworld. They have travelled in all directions and been cross-matched with otherexpressions of the original source. Egypt, Sumer, Babylon, Asia and China arecommon themes for the major Illuminati bloodlines and they do not relate to oneEarth race. Instead, they have impregnated many nations to advance their powerand the main carrier of the ‘Illuminati’ DNA is the female line. History hasconcentrated on the male line when it is the female, ‘the Goddess’ in Illuminatiparlance, which has carried it through the centuries in the so-calledmitochondrial DNA.His Royal Highness, Mr PresidentThese ancient Illuminati bloodlines have since become the presidents of theUnited States, the prime ministers, the leading banking and business families,the media owners and those who control the military. Look at the US presidentsas an example. There are more than 300 million people in the United States todayand many hundreds of millions more have lived there since the leading FreemasonGeorge Washington was inaugurated as the first President in 1789. The Americannation was also formed from a vastly diverse genetic pool from across the world.If it really is the Land of the Free and if, as is claimed, anyone really canbecome the president, you would fairly expect that the 43 presidents from GeorgeWashington to George W. Bush would express that genetic diversity. You’re havinga laugh. The presidents of the United States are as much a royal dynasty asanything in Europe, from whence their bloodlines came. Of those 43 presidents sofar, 34 alone go back genetically to Charlemagne (742-814), an Illuminatibloodline and the most famous monarch of what we now call France. He was leaderof the Franks, after whom we get the name France, and Emperor of the Holy RomanEmpire, an Illuminati operation that controlled Europe for centuries. Burke’sPeerage, the blue-blood ‘bible’ of royal and aristocratic genealogy, is one ofmany genealogical sources to have highlighted the royal connections of USpresidents. In the 1996 presidential election campaign involving Bill Clintonand Bob Dole, Burke’s Peerage revealed that the candidate with the most royalgenes had won every single presidential election in US history. Clinton’svictory over Dole and the illegal election of George W. Bush over Al Gore in2000 have continued this sequence. Burkes Peerage confirmed in a Reuters reporton October 17th 2000 that Bush and Gore had an “unusual” number of royalconnections with Bush the most prominently connected. According to the report,Bush is related to every European monarch on and off the throne and has“kinship” (kingship) with every member of Britain’s royal family. He is a 13thcousin of Britain’s Queen Mother, who died in 2002 at the age of 101, and herdaughter, Queen Elizabeth. Bush is a 13th cousin, once removed, of the heir tothe throne Prince Charles, and has a direct descent from Henry III and fromHenry VIII’s sister, Mary Tudor, who was also the wife of Louis XI of France.Bush is further descended from Charles II of England. Harold Brooks-Baker,publishing director of Burke’s Peerage, said in the Reuters report: “It is nowclear that Mr Gore and Mr Bush have an unusually large number of royal and nobledescents.” After all these years of research it was far from unusual to me.Brooks-Baker said there had always been a significant “royal factor” inpresidential elections with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin andTheodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, among others, all boasting blue-bloodlinks. Bush and Gore are especially well connected, it seems. “In point offact”, said Brooks-Baker, “never in the history of the United States have twopresidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances.” Gore, acousin of former President Richard Nixon, is a descendant of England’s Edward Iwith direct links to the Holy Roman Empire through Emperors Louis II, Charles IIand Louis I. This made him another descendant of Charlemagne and a cousin ofGeorge W. Bush.Gary Boyd Roberts is a genealogist at the New England Historic GenealogicalSociety in Boston and one of the foremost authorities on the royal ancestry ofAmerican presidents. He has confirmed that George W. Bush is descended fromBritish royalty going as far back as the 12th century to King Henry I, the sonof William the Conqueror. It was William who invaded Britain from France and wonthe Battle of Hastings in 1066. Prominent on William’s side were members of theSt Clair family, a major Illuminati bloodline, a strand of which moved toScotland and became known as Sinclair with their base at Roslyn Castle nearEdinburgh. The St Clairs/Sinclairs were major players in the formation of theKnights Templar secret society, one of the most influential vehicles for theIlluminati for the best part of a thousand years. In other books I have detailedmany other royal and aristocratic connections to the Bush family from theirorigins with the powerful Percy family in England that changed their name toPierce when they fled to America after their involvement in the failed‘Gunpowder Plot’ to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605. Both father GeorgeBush and his wife Barbara are from the Pierce line. The Gunpowder Plot wasorganised by the Jesuits, the secret society that controls the Roman CatholicChurch and remains one of the most powerful expressions of the Illuminati tothis day. The Bushes are also related to the aristocratic Anglo-AmericanGrosvenor family from which come the Dukes of Westminster. They own greatswathes of the most valuable real estate in London, much of it in the City ofLondon financial district, a global centre for the Illuminati.In 2002, many years after I began writing about these blood connections of theIlluminati families, a genealogical website, www.Myfamily.com[http://www.Myfamily.com], revealed the bloodline links between the Bush familyand British royalty, the aristocratic Spencer family of Princess Diana, andwartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, who was an offshoot of the elitearistocratic dynasty, the Marlborough family of Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.Another Illuminati front man, US Secretary of State Colin Powell, was revealedto have British royal connections together with Richard Nixon, the cousin ofGore. You will find a similar story all over the world. Credo Mutwa, theofficial historian of the Zulu nation, told me how so many black African leadersthat were placed in power after the colonial masters gave the continent‘independence’, came from the bloodlines of African kings and queens who claimedto descend from the same ‘gods’ as their white counterparts.Hiding the secretsOfficial history has been changed to hide the fact that the world has beencontrolled by the same interbreeding tribe for thousands of years. This is nevermore so than with the major religions. They all have inner and outer levels ofknowledge. The inner level carries the secrets going back to the ancient Mysteryschools of places like Sumer, Babylon and Egypt. These include the secrets ofthe bloodline and only the chosen few are initiated into this awareness. Theouter level is where the secrets are hidden in code and allegory and sold, witha deity, to the masses as the ‘truth’. The New Testament Gospel stories arebased on the initiation ceremonies and esoteric secrets – including astrologyand Sun worship – that were performed and communicated in the Mystery schools.But they are presented as a literal story to fool the people. The religions, notleast Christianity, Judaism and Islam (all spawned from the same source) arecarriers of the secrets (inner) and controllers of the people by hiding thesecrets with allegedly ‘literal’ stories (outer). The same basic ‘Jesus’ tale ofthe Son of God who died for humanity was told around the world thousands ofyears before Christianity. This is related to the winter solstice or midwinterfestival when the Sun is at the least powerful point in its cycle in thenorthern hemisphere. They said that on the solstice, our December 21/22nd, theSun had ‘died’. Three days later – the 25th – they said the Sun was born or bornagain. Thus we have a long line of Sun gods given the ‘birthday’ of December25th. The Jesus of the Gospels in a symbol of the Sun and the stories include ahost of other Mystery school knowledge and esoteric concepts. The theme of theopen tomb or coffin is another example of what I mean. In the ancient Mysteryschools, the chosen would lie in an open tomb to symbolise their death andrebirth into the secrets. This is why they have found a tomb in the GreatPyramid at Giza, but no mummies have been discovered either there or in anyother pyramid. They were not burial chambers, but places of initiation in whichthe tomb/coffin – ‘re-birth’ into the secrets – played a central part.Therefore, you find these tomb themes repeating through history in the secretsocieties and, in allegory form, in religious stories and ceremonies. Longbefore Christianity they had a ritual in Persia in which a young man, apparentlydead, was restored to life. He was called the Saviour and his sufferings weresaid to have ensured the salvation of the people. His priests would shout:“Rejoice, O sacred initiated! Your God is risen. His death and sufferings haveworked your salvation.” The same tale was told in Egypt about Horus, their Sonof God, and in India it was told about Krishna a thousand years beforeChristianity. In the Gospels we have the story of Lazarus lying in his tomb andthen ‘rising from the dead’. The story of Jesus being laid dead in his tomb andthen ‘rising’ is the same allegory for the initiation ceremonies in the Mysteryschools. It is for this reason that the tomb or coffin ritual is performed byFreemasons and other secret societies to this day although it is only the verytop levels of the network that know the real secrets and entry to that innersanctum is by bloodline only.The blood in bloodlineThe bloodline families manipulate through this network of secret societies,ultimately controlled by the Illuminati. Many of these secret inter-connectinggroups are bizarre in the extreme and the infamous Skull and Bones Society isone example of this. This is based in a windowless mausoleum appropriately knownas ‘The Tomb’ alongside Yale University at New Haven, Connecticut and it was theinspiration for the Skulls movies. The Bushes are related to the Tafts, whoprovided President William Howard Taft and it was his father, Alphonso Taft, andanother Illuminati bloodline, William Harrison Russell, who established theSkull and Bones Society. George W. Bush and his father are both members, as wasthe President’s grandfather, the Hitler supporter and funder, Prescott Bush (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free). The Skull and Bones Society initiates 15 Yalestudents (bloodline) into its ranks every year and they pledge allegiance to thesociety above all else for the rest of their lives. When its initiates becomePresident of the United States or enter other positions of power, their firstallegiance is to the agenda of the secret society, not what is best for thepeople or country they are claiming to serve. As I write, one of the Democraticpresidential candidates planning to ‘oppose’ the Skull and Bones initiate,George Bush, is the Skull and Bones initiate, John Kerry. In 2000, Ron Rosenbaumof the New York Observer and a team of others used high-tech night visionequipment to record a Skull and Bones initiation ceremony in the inner courtyardof ‘The Tomb’.3 They witnessed a robed Bonesman posing as George W. Bushharanguing initiates in an “eerily accurate Texas drawl” saying: “I’m gonna reamyou like I reamed Al Gore” and “I’m gonna kill you like I killed Al Gore.”Rosenbaum reported that the Bush sound-alike appeared a bit disgruntled with hisrole and he complained: “I got the power to bomb the crap out of China and theygive me this station?” He also said, “I’m the President of the motha-fuckin’USA”, sounding more and more like Bush, said Rosenbaum. Others were heard toshout, “Take that plunger out of my ass!” and initiates hurled sexual insults ateach other like “lick my bumhole neophyte (new initiate)” as they were forced tokneel and kiss a skull at the feet of the initiators. “Lick my ass, neophyte!”and “Do you like my bum, neophyte?” were also heard. Remember George W. Bush andhis father have been through these rituals. Initiates were witnessed by the NewYork Observer team acting out “the tableau of a throat-cutting ritual murder.” 4One of the Patriarchs of The Order said: “We ought to get better blood than thisfuckin’ syrup, man.” Rosenbaum writes:> “[The initiates] were forced face-to-face with a shocking tableau: a guy> holding what seemed like a butcher’s knife, wearing a kind of animal-skin> ‘barbarian’ look, stood over what seemed to be a woman covered in fake blood> and not much else. The neophyte then approached a skull a few feet away from> the knife-wielder-and-victim tableau. The neophyte knelt and kissed the skull,> at which point the guy with the knife knelt and cut the throat of the prone> figure. (Well, pretended to cut the throat.)” 5 The rituals are full of death imagery and the initiates are told they must ‘dieto the barbarian world’ and be reborn in the Elysian company of the elect ofwhat they call ‘The Order’. The ceremony of ‘re-birth’ includes lying in acoffin (of course) and revealing all your sexual secrets to your fellowinitiates. Another witness said he had seen a figure dressed like the devil,another in a hooded-skeleton costume and others in robes. The ritual alsoincluded the death mantra: “The Hangman equals death! The Devil equals death!Death equals death!” It involved orders for the initiates to fetch bones,including the femur or thigh bone, and this is just one of the black magicsecret societies that provide the personnel that control global events. AsRosenbaum said:> “It’s an initiation ceremony that has bonded diplomats, media moguls, bankers> and spies into a lifelong, multi-generational fellowship far more influential> than any fraternity. It was – and still remains – the heart of the heart of> the American establishment. > “But the relationships are first forged by the rituals and the fact that the> founders of Time Inc. and the CIA, as well as several Secretaries of State and> National Security Advisors – the men who made the decision to drop the> Hiroshima bomb, invade the Bay of Pigs and plunge us into Vietnam, the Tafts,> the Bundys, the Buckleys, the Harrimans, the Lovetts – all took part in this> initiation ritual may have something to do with the real world power of those> bonds. The unspoken understanding, the comfort level with the clandestine, the> nods and winks with which power is exercised.” 6 If you think the Skull and Bones initiation is bizarre, you might consult someof my other books. What you have just read is mild compared with other ritualsin which these people are involved. The Illuminati bloodlines have engaged inhuman sacrifice and blood-drinking ceremonies since ancient times and they stilldo. I am talking about the most famous people on the planet that you see on thenews every day. When you realise what they do in these sacrifice rituals, oftento children, you no longer need to ask how these people can order the slaughterof thousands and think nothing of it.The travelling empireThe bloodlines, and the Illuminati secret society network through which theymanipulate, has been the force behind many of the major empires of history. Inancient times Sumer and Babylon were both headquarters for the ‘Illuminati’ inthe land now called Iraq, and Egypt was extremely important to them also. It wasthe accounts, texts and artefacts from Sumer and Babylon that were burned orlooted from Iraqi museums in the wake of the American and British invasion.After Babylon, the Illuminati bloodline network moved its headquarters to Romeand it was during this time that we had the Roman Empire and the creation of theRoman Church or institutionalised Christianity. The Roman Catholic Churchstructure controlled by the Jesuit secret society remains at the heart ofIlluminati operations. The ‘operational’ headquarters moved into northern Europeafter the fall of the Roman Empire and for a period it was based in Amsterdam,the Netherlands. This was when the Dutch began to build their empire through theDutch East India Company and they settled South Africa. In 1688, William ofOrange, one of the bloodlines, invaded England from the Netherlands and took thethrone as William III in 1689. William ruled jointly with Queen Mary and then byhimself after her death in 1694. In that year William signed the charter thatcreated the Bank of England and the global banking system began to emerge.Banking and manufactured debt has always been one of the main vehicles used bythe bloodlines to control humanity. From this time the bloodlines and theirIlluminati secret society network moved their centre of operation to London andwhat followed, of course, was the ‘great’ and enormous British Empire. This wasnot the Empire of the ‘British’ in truth, but that of the Illuminati bloodlinesbased in Britain.This expansion of the British and other European empires to all parts of theworld exported the bloodlines to every continent, including, most importantlytoday, North America. When the European empires began to recede and collapse,especially in the twentieth century, it appeared that these colony continents,like the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia, had won their ‘independence’.Instead, the Illuminati bloodlines were merely exchanging open control for thefar more effective covert control – manipulation of events by the Hidden Handthat the public has no idea exists. While these empires were apparently beingdismantled, the Illuminati left in their ‘former’ colonies, including the UnitedStates, the bloodline and the secret society network through which they operate.They have continued to control events in these ‘former’ colonies ever since, aspart of a long-planned agenda to impose centralised control of the planet andits people. This is designed to be secured through the structure I have outlined– a world government, army, central bank and currency; a microchipped populationconnected to a global computer; and a society based on constant and totalsurveillance of every man, woman and child. A ridiculous conspiracy ‘theory’?Well have another look around and you’ll see that this is happening now andnever more blatantly than since September 11th.The UK crime prevention charity Nacro says that the British government and localauthorities have spent some £4 billion on surveillance in the last decade andinvolved up to three quarters of the Home Office crime prevention budget in thelate 1990s.7 There are now more than two million cameras and the British are themost watched nation on Earth. But there has been only one Home Office study intotheir effectiveness and that concluded they are not always the best option.8They are not being installed to stop crime, but to track the people. A spokesmanfor campaign group Liberty said: “Our Government has developed an almostobsessive desire to gather and control more and more data on its citizens.” 9 Astepping stone to the microchip is the identity card. These are being planned byBritain’s freedom-destroying government, under the name ‘entitlement card’. Theywant every resident aged 16 and over to have a compulsory card. It will have aphotograph, personal computer-readable identification, including fingerprintsand iris recognition, and a high-tech strip that allows civil servants and thepolice to link it into the Government’s national computer databases.10 Hidingthe real meaning of identity with entitlement is straight from the Orwellianguide to the manipulation of language. This is appropriate because we are seeingunfold by the day the very Big Brother society described by George Orwell (realname Eric Blair) in his famous book, 1984.11 Orwell was well aware that thesociety he described was possible, given the way the world was moving in hislifetime and the connections that he had.Image [../Images/00008.jpg]Figure 3: Pyramids of Manipulation Pyramids within pyramidsThe Illuminati structure can be symbolised as a web or as a pyramid in which thefew at the top dictate to the many at the bottom. The many are kept in ignoranceof what is really going on. The pyramid structure of secret societies ismirrored in government, banking, business and every other organisation andinstitution. Society is structured like Russian dolls with one doll inside abigger one until the biggest doll encompasses them all. The Illuminati replacethe ‘dolls’ with pyramids (Figure 3). Only the few at the top of the pyramidsknow the real agenda and what the organisation is trying to achieve. The furtheryou go down the pyramid the more people are working for the organisation, butthe less they know about its real agenda. They are only aware of the individualjob they do every day. They don’t know how their contribution (apparentlyinnocent in isolation) connects with those of other employees in other areas ofthe company, government or whatever. They are ‘compartmentalised’ and the onlypeople who know how it all fits together are the very few sitting at the top –the bloodline families and their lackeys.The smaller pyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger andbigger pyramids, until eventually you have the pyramid that encompasses all ofthe banks. It is the same with the transnational corporations, politicalparties, secret societies, media empires and the military. If you go high enoughin this structure all the transnational corporations (like the oil cartel),major political parties, secret societies, media empires and the military (viaNATO, for instance), are controlled by the same families who sit atop thebiggest pyramids. In the end there is a global pyramid that includes all theothers, the biggest ‘doll’ if you like. At the capstone of this you will findthe most elite of the Illuminati, the ‘purest’ of their bloodlines. In this way,they can coordinate through apparently unconnected, even ‘opposing’ areas ofsociety, the same policies. All roads lead eventually to them – everything fromthe food we eat; the water we drink; the ‘medical care’ we receive, includingvaccines; the ‘news’ we watch, hear and read; the ‘entertainment’ we are given;the governments that dictate to us; the military that enforces the will of thegovernments; and the drug-running network aimed at destroying young people. Thesame families and their gofers control all of these areas and much more. Thispyramid structure is how they have manipulated the explosion of centralisationin every area of life, government, finance, business, media and military. It isnot by accident or natural occurrence, but by coldly calculated design. Theoutstanding Australian journalist John Pilger produced a rare and excellentexposé of globalisation for British Independent Television in July 2001 in whichhe pointed out that just 200 corporations are now responsible for a quarter ofthe world’s economic activity. But there is another level to this that weurgently need to understand. This pyramid system means that those ‘200’corporations are, in effect, one Corporation controlled by the same force.Globalisation is not just a group of greedy corporations seeking to maximiseprofit, it is far bigger than that.A perfect example of the Illuminati’s compartmentalised pyramids was theinfamous Freemasonry lodge in Rome called Propaganda Masonica Due or P-2. It wasofficially headed by the Mussolini fascist, Licio Gelli, who was a closeconfidant and financial advisor to the Argentina dictator, Juan Peron, and wasinvited to the inaugurations of Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.Gelli called himself a friend of father George Bush, but then he was sure to bean associate of Bush given that he was a fascist orchestrating terror andmurder. When Gelli’s premises were raided by police in March 1981, theydiscovered 962 names on the P-2 membership lists in his office safe and asuitcase. There were three cabinet ministers and 40 other MPs, 43 generals,eight admirals and hundreds of civil servants and diplomats, heads of thesecurity services, the chiefs of police in Italy’s four biggest cities,industrialists, TV stars and 24 journalists.P-2 also had a powerful foreign membership, including one of the most activeIlluminati operatives of the last 40 years, Henry Kissinger, the US Secretary ofState and war criminal. The CIA and Nazi International were also closelyconnected to P-2 (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free for more background).Like the Illuminati structure in every country, P-2 was a state within a state.The names of the P-2 members were only known to Gelli and his closestassociates. Not even the other members knew all of the others. Gelli divided themembership into two divisions and then sub-divided them into a series of smallergroups. Only the leaders of these groups knew who their members were and theydid not know the members of the other groups. P-2 members were controlled by theterror of knowing the horrific penalties of not doing as they were told. In thisway, different Illuminati members and stooges can play a part in events like9/11 without knowing how their contribution connected with those of othercompartmentalised people like themselves. Once the deed is done and they realisewhat has occurred they are too frightened to say anything because they know theconsequences. Incidentally, Silvio Berlusconi, the crook, media tycoon and PrimeMinister of Italy, was a member of P-2.12 His friendship and ‘meeting of minds’with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is, therefore, no surprise at allto me.Manipulating the herdMost people find it impossible to accept that a few people can manipulate thelives of billions and operate through all institutions and countries. Iunderstand that; but once you have the pyramids in place and you know how tocondition the mind and reality of the population, it is relativelystraightforward. When a few people wish to control and direct a mass ofhumanity, there are certain structures that have to be in place. These are thesame whether you are seeking to manipulate an individual, family, tribe, town,country, continent or planet. First you have to impose the ‘norms’, what areconsidered right and wrong, possible or impossible, sane or insane, good andbad. Most of the people will follow those ‘norms’ without question because ofthe baa-baa, herd mentality that has prevailed within the collective human mindfor at least thousands of years. Second, you have to make life very unpleasantfor those few who challenge your imposed ‘norms’. The ‘norms’, or ‘consensusreality’, are essential to our control and, when I get to the main focus of thisbook a little later, this will be even more obvious and placed in an evengreater context.The most effective way to do this in order to ensure compliance with thesenorms, is to make it difficult to be different. You make those who voice adifferent view, version of ‘truth’ and lifestyle, stand out like a black sheepin the human herd. You have already conditioned the herd to accept your norms asits reality and, through arrogance and ignorance, they ridicule or condemn thosewith a different spin on life. This pressurises the black sheep to conform andserves as a warning to those others in the herd who are also thinking ofbreaking away or challenging the prevailing reality. As I outlined earlier, thisfear of being different and voicing a view that challenges the ‘norms’ isoverwhelmingly the fear of what other people will think of us. In reality, thefear of what the sheep around us will say and do if we seek to leave the herdand question its conditioned assumptions. This mentality means that the massesare policing themselves and keeping each other in line. The sheep become thesheepdog for the rest of the herd. This is nothing less than psychologicalfascism – the Thought Police with agents in every home, everywhere. They areagents so deeply conditioned that most have no idea they are unpaidmind-controllers. “I’m just doing what’s right for my children”, I hear themsay. No, what you have been programmed to believe is right for them and thebelief, also, that only you know best.This is all part of the divide and rule strategy so vital to the few controllingthe many. Everyone plays a part in everyone else’s mental, emotional andphysical imprisonment. All the controllers have to do is set the ‘norms’, pullthe right strings at the right time and make their human puppets dance to theappropriate tune. This they do by dictating what is taught in what we bravelycall ‘education’ and controlling what passes for ‘news’ through theIlluminati-owned media. In this way they can dictate to the unthinking,unquestioning herd what it should believe about itself, other people, life,history and current events. Once you set the ‘norms’ there is no need to controlevery journalist or reporter or government official. The media and theinstitutions take their ‘truth’ from those same ‘norms’ and official statements,and ridicule and condemn by reflex action anyone who offers another vision ofreality.Sheeple warsThe self-policing of the human herd goes far deeper than people in uniform oradministrators of government. It starts with conditioned parents who imposetheir conditioning on their children and pressure them to follow theirreligious, political, economic and cultural norms. One extreme example is thosewho insist that their offspring succumb to arranged marriages because of therules of their ludicrous religion. There are the children of Jehovah’s Witnesseswho have been denied life-saving blood transfusions because their brain-deadparents insist on conducting every aspect of their lives according to thecontradictory dictates of a book purveying so many stories of pure fantasy. Thecreation of the mental and emotional sheep pen of norms that imprisons 99% ofhumanity goes on minute by minute in subtle and less subtle ways. There arechildren of Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu parents who don’t accept thereligion, but still follow it because they don’t want to upset their family. Thesheep are keeping the other sheep in line and making life unpleasant for anyonewho tries to escape.It is easy for a small group of interbreeding family bloodlines to control thelives (the minds) of billions, once the major institutions of ‘information’ arein place, as they have been for thousands of years in their various forms. Thereare not enough of these manipulators and their stooges to control the populationphysically and they have had to create a structure in which humans controlthemselves through mental, emotional and, increasingly, physical imposition.Once you have the herd mentality policing itself, there is a third phase in thisentrapment of human consciousness. You create factions within the herd and setthem to war with each other. This is done by creating ‘different’ belief systems(which are not different at all) and bringing them into conflict. These beliefsystems are known as religions, political parties, economic theories and “isms”of endless variety. These beliefs are perceived as ‘opposites’ when, as Ipointed out in my book, I Am Me, I Am Free, they are opposames. Look at theopposames in politics. The far left, as symbolised by Josef Stalin in Russia,introduced centralised control, military dictatorship and concentration camps.The ‘opposite’ of this was the far right, as symbolised by Adolf Hitler. Whatdid he impose? Centralised control, military dictatorship and concentrationcamps. Yet these two opposames were set at war with each other amid propagandathat claimed they were opposites. The only difference between the Soviet Unionand the so-called ‘West’ during the Cold War was that the Soviet Union wasopenly controlled by the few and the West was secretly controlled by the few.When you get to the capstone of the pyramid you find they were the same fewcontrolling both ‘sides’. The same force operating through Wall Street and theCity of London funded all ‘sides’ in the two world wars and that’s provable (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free).So the methods of manipulation can be summarised like this:> •You need to first imprison the human mind with a rigid belief and a> fundamentally limited sense of reality – the sheep pen. It doesn’t much matter> what these beliefs may be, so long as they are rigid and discourage free> thought and open-minded questioning. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism> and all the rest each make their contribution to human servitude while> apparently claiming different ‘truths’.> •You encourage those who follow these rigid beliefs to impose them on others> and make life very difficult and unpleasant for anyone who does not conform.> •You bring these beliefs into conflict to ensure the divide and rule you so> desperately need for control by the few. While the masses are busy fighting> each other, and seeking to impose their beliefs and views on each other, they> don’t see that the Illuminati have strings attached to all of them.Problem – Reaction – SolutionThere are techniques of mass manipulation that people need to understand if theyare to begin to see through the game. The main one I have dubbed‘problem-reaction-solution’. This has been used for thousands of years toadvance the agenda and is one the most effective weapons of the Illuminati.Problem-reaction-solution is the key to understanding what really happened onSeptember 11th 2001 and why. It works like this: you know that if you openlypropose to remove basic freedoms, start a war or centralise power, there will bea public reaction against it. So you don’t openly and honestly propose suchplans, you play the P-R-S scam. At stage one you create a problem. It could be acountry attacking another, a government or economic collapse, or a ‘terroristattack’. Anything in fact that the public will think requires a ‘solution’. Atstage two, you report the ‘problems’ you have covertly created in the way youwish the people to perceive them. Crucially you find someone to blame for theproblem, a ‘patsy’ like Lee Harvey Oswald when President Kennedy wasassassinated, or Osama bin Laden. You spin the background to these events in away that encourages the people to demand that “something must be done”. Theseare the words you want to hear because they allow you to move on to stage three,the sting. At this point you openly offer the solutions to the problems you haveyourself created. These solutions, of course, involve the centralisation ofpower, the sacking of officials or politicians that are getting in your way, andthe removal of more basic freedoms as you advance further to your global fasciststate. Just think of the freedoms that have been removed because of 9/11. A moresubtle part of the technique is to propose far more extreme changes than youexpect to get away with because this allows any opposition to think you havecompromised and met them halfway. But you know that you have other ‘problems’ inthe pipeline to push the agenda on.With this technique you can so manipulate the public mind that people willdemand or at least allow you to introduce what, in normal circumstances, theywould vehemently oppose. The Oklahoma bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Building onApril 19th 1995 was a problem-reaction-solution classic, as I explained in Andthe Truth Shall Set You Free and Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade CenterDisaster. What followed the death and destruction in Oklahoma were‘anti-terrorism’ laws that sailed through Congress without challenge and removedfundamental freedoms from American people. Since September 11th, this agenda hasbeen advanced in gigantic leaps. I don’t share the attitudes of people likeTimothy McVeigh, nor do I defend disturbed people like Osama bin Laden, butthat’s not the point. Establishing the truth of what happened is the point, nomatter what the views and attitudes of those involved. It is called justice. Thetwo most effective problem-reaction-solutions in the twentieth century were thetwo global wars. They changed the face of the world, as wars always do, and ledto a massive centralisation of power. The United Nations, like its predecessorthe League of Nations, was an Illuminati creation to act as a Trojan horse, orstalking horse, for world government.“Journalistic” junkThe media play their part to perfection in these ‘problem-reaction-solution’scenarios. At ownership level, people like Rupert Murdoch of the NewsCorporation know what is going on. The editors they appoint might know somethingabout it, as may certain columnists, but most of the journalists will have noidea. The editor is always there to block anything they write that is againstthe interests of the Illuminati – as directed by the owner – and if they insiston pursuing an unwelcome story they find themselves looking for another job.Most of the ‘information’ that journalists present comes from official(Illuminati) sources anyway. In the immediate aftermath of a major event such asSeptember 11th, where are the reporters getting their information from? Officialsources! Name me a single piece of relevant information broadcast by themainstream media about what happened on 9/11, how it was done, who did it andwhat the retaliation should be, that did not come from official sources. Notone! We are told that White House sources say this, FBI sources say that, andCIA or Pentagon sources say the other. This is how the Illuminati transmitthrough the media the version of events they wish the public to believe. Thesereports are blazed across the front pages of newspapers and the top of radio andtelevision news bulletins throughout the world, and what they say becomes the‘norm’, the official ‘history’. In the weeks and months that follow, researcherswho are interested in the real truth begin to dig away. Over and over theyestablish and document the proof of how the official version was a lie fromstart to finish. But where are their reports published? In small-circulationnewsletters, self-published books, on the Internet and radio stations thatoperate with a fraction of the money and potential audience of the Illuminatiempires. Therefore, years after the official version has been demolished itstill prevails in the public mind. Stop anyone in London, New York, Cape Town,Sydney, anywhere, and ask them what happened on September 11th, or in Oklahoma,the Second World War or Kosovo. Almost every time they will give you theofficial story because that is the only one they have heard. If we had realmainstream journalism the problem-reaction-solution technique could not work.The official version of events would be investigated and shown to have nofoundation. This fact would be communicated to the people and the publicreaction, desired by the authorities, would not be forthcoming. But instead, wehave a media that is little more than a public relations office for the officialversion of life and that makes problem-reaction-solution a breeze for themanipulators.The 9/11 fairytaleWhen I first heard about the attacks of September 11th, 2001, I knew it wasanother problem-reaction-solution. It contained every element of the technique:the ‘problem’ of four airliners hijacked over two hours with no effectiveresponse from the military or government until the deeds were done; theimmediate naming of the ‘villain’, Osama bin Laden, on the basis of no evidencewhatsoever; the reaction of the people in accepting the official story anddemanding that “something must be done”; and the ‘solution’, the destruction ofbasic rights, freedoms and privacy in the name of a ‘war on terrorism’ that hasso far cost the lives of more than a hundred thousand (minimum) civilians inAfghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. From the day those planes crashed I began toinvestigate the official story and not one strand of it fits with another. It isthe Big Lie and I document the background, in great detail, over 500 pages inAlice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster.The mainstream media merely repeated the lies of the US authorities and thisbecame the accepted truth. It is a lie. When a copy of my book was sent to everymajor newspaper, radio and television news and current affairs show in theUnited States and United Kingdom they all ignored it, save for one Scottishnewspaper that interviewed me, but did not report the content. Osama bin Laden,a long-time asset of the CIA, was no more the orchestrator of 9/11 than I was.It was organised through the very agencies that gave the media the officialversion. How many people know that at least seven of the 19 hijackers named bythe FBI are still alive? What did they do, parachute? How many know that theBush family and the Bin Laden family have long been extremely close? Or that theformer head of the family construction business, Salem bin Laden, brother ofOsama, was an investor in President Bush’s first oil company? Or that aninvestor in a later Bush company was Khalid bin Mahfouz, an associate of BinLaden, who was named by the US State Department during the Clintonadministration as a funder of the al-Qaeda terrorist network? Or that al-Qaedawas funded into existence by the CIA during the Soviet occupation ofAfghanistan? Or that the ‘al-Qaeda’ tunnel systems in Afghanistan were built byBin Laden Construction with CIA money funnelled through Pakistan militaryintelligence, the ISI, which is the CIA branch in Pakistan? Yet again it is acase of the same force controlling two apparent ‘sides’ to the same end.President Bashar Assad of Syria has even doubted the continuing existence ofal-Qaeda and I understand that. “Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Wasit in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?” he asked. Assad said Osama bin Laden“cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communicationsto the four corners of the world?” As he pointed out, this is not logical.13The official story of 9/11 is so blatantly preposterous that every effort hasbeen made by the Bush administration to stop any inquiry into what happened.When he was forced into placating such demands, he announced an investigation tobe headed by Henry Kissinger, one of the most prominent Illuminati operatives ofthe last more than 40 years. This was so outrageous even for Bush that Kissingerwas forced by public pressure to stand down when he refused to name the clientsof his Illuminati ‘consulting firm’, Kissinger Associates (see And The TruthShall Set You Free for more about its activities). In May 2003, it was revealedthat Bush and the US intelligence agencies were blocking the release ofsensitive information about the attacks and delaying publication of a 900-pagecongressional report on how the terrorist assault happened.14 “The White Houseis continuing a trend of presenting obstacles to us rather than cooperating withus”, said Tim Roemer, a former House member who participated in thecongressional inquiry.15 They were trying to suppress the findings of a reportthat accepts as its basic premise that the foundations of the official story(Osama bin Laden did it) are true. Not even that level of inquiry is acceptable,never mind one that uncovers the real story – it was planned and carried out byforces within the United States. When the Congressional ‘Inquiry’ into 9/11published its report in July 2003 the content was truly pathetic.‘Anti-terrorist’ terroristsOnce again I emphasise that what appear to be ‘sides’ in a conflict areinvariably controlled or manipulated by the same force (Figure 4). TheIlluminati operate through Islamic terror groups as they do through American andBritish terror groups, i.e. the US and UK governments. They appear to be two‘sides’ on the nightly news, but at the top of the pyramid they answer to thesame masters. As I was writing this book, a report by the United Kingdom’s mostsenior police officer, Sir John Stevens, revealed what researchers had longknown – the British Army and the Northern Ireland police force, the Royal UlsterConstabulary (RUC), had colluded with the largest loyalist terrorist group, theUlster Defense Association (UDA), to murder Catholics. Stevens, the MetropolitanPolice Commissioner, said that British military intelligence informants andagents “were allowed to operate without effective control and to participate interrorist crimes”. He also found that British military intelligence in NorthernIreland had helped to prolong the conflict and murder known as the ‘Troubles’ inthe late 1980s. The Stevens Report detailed how:> •Actions or omissions by ‘security forces’ led to deaths of innocent people.> •Collusion by the ‘security forces’ was involved in the murders of solicitor> Pat Finucane and student Adam Lambert.> •Three official inquiries into these events were wilfully obstructed and> misled by the authorities responsible.Stevens defined collusion as the wilful failure to keep records; absence ofaccountability; withholding intelligence and evidence; and agents involved inmurder. The inquiry established that the British Army’s secret agent handlingteam, the Force Research Unit, recruited a former terrorist paramilitary calledBrian Nelson to return to Northern Ireland and rejoin the terrorist UlsterDefense Association. Nelson, codenamed 6137, became the UDA’s head ofintelligence and supplied the army chiefs with the group’s possible targets.Army Intelligence then basically decided who was murdered. The Stevens teamplanned to arrest Nelson on January 10th 1990. When they returned to theirsecure headquarters before the arrest they found their offices ablaze. Firealarms, telephones and heat-sensitive intruder alarms had been disabled. Thefire destroyed many of their files, but fortunately others had been copied andmoved to England. Brian Nelson fled Northern Ireland, but was later caught andjailed for ten years for conspiracy to murder, despite pleas on his behalf byColonel Gordon Kerr of the British Army’s Force Research Unit. Nelson wasreleased in 1999 and lived at a secret location in England. In April 2003 hedied of a brain haemorrhage only days before the Stevens Report was published.How convenient. Such was the obstruction of the Stevens inquiry that the reporttook 14 years to deliver. Stevens said that he and his team were constantlyspied upon and betrayed by police and army colleagues. He added that he wasstill determined to try to bring Pat Finucane’s killers to justice and he wasstill investigating just how far up the chain of command the collusion mighthave gone. Try the top.Image [../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 4: The same force manipulates through both ‘sides’ to control the outcomeand produce a ‘movie’ version of events to fool the people I highlight these findings because while it may have caused a stir in the UnitedKingdom to know that British Army Intelligence and the Northern Ireland policeauthority were colluding with terrorists to kill people, this is the rule notthe exception across the world. It is happening all the time on a massive scalebecause the Illuminati agenda is the focus of these crackpots, not preventingterrorism and murder. This is what happened on September 11th. The‘anti-terrorist’ organisations like the (top level of) the National SecurityAgency, CIA, FBI, the United States government and military, etc., were theforces through which the 9/11 attacks were both planned and allowed to happen.Genuine FBI agents were incensed to have their inquiries into terror groups inthe United States blocked by FBI headquarters before 9/11 and President Bushordered an end to investigations into the terrorist activities of the Bin Ladenfamily in the United States in the months before the attacks (see Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). Days after September 11th, atleast 11 members of the Bin Laden family in America were allowed to leave forSaudi Arabia in a private jet from Boston Logan Airport. This was at a time whenOsama bin Laden was the world’s most wanted man and thousands of Arabs werebeing arrested and jailed without trial across the country just because of theirname and skin colour. Why did this happen? The Bushes and Bin Ladens arelong-time bosom buddies working to basically the same end. Personnel from themilitary and intelligence community have been placed in key posts in the Bushadministration since 9/11, including General John A. Gordon, former deputy CIAdirector, as White House ‘homeland-security [control] advisor’.The horrors of September 11th have been used, as intended, to further the agendafor global control and the destruction of freedom. Amnesty International’s 2003annual report says: “The ‘war on terror’, far from making the world a saferplace, has made it more dangerous by curtailing human rights, undermining therule of international law and shielding governments from scrutiny.”16 The reportaccused governments of “trampling over human rights in the name of fightingterrorism”. Put another way: problem-reaction-solution. Amnesty’s secretarygeneral, Irene Khan, said: “What would have been unacceptable on September 10th,2001, is now becoming almost the norm. What would have been an outrage inWestern countries during the Cold War – torture, detention without trial,truncated justice – is readily accepted in some countries today for somepeople.” 17 The report continues: “Governments have spent billions to strengthennational security and the ‘war on terror’. Yet for millions of people, the realsources of insecurity are corruption, repression, discrimination, extremepoverty and preventable diseases.” 18 But it does not suit the agenda to addresssuch issues, quite the reverse, and so the suffering goes on.Totalitarian tip-toeThe bedfellow of problem-reaction-solution is the stepping-stones approach orthe totalitarian tip-toe as I call it. You know where you intend to lead people,but you realise that if you gave them the true picture or went there in onegiant leap, you would face substantial opposition. So you travel to yourdestination in little steps and each one is presented in isolation andunconnected to all the others. It is like a drip, drip, drip, to globalcentralisation. This technique was used most obviously with the super-state nowknown as the European Union. After the war if the politicians had suggested acentralised Europe with common laws and currency, there would have been anoutcry. People would have said they had been fighting Hitler to stop just such aEuropean dictatorship and there was no way they were accepting another. Toovercome this, the Illuminati offered a ‘free trade area’ and even used theproblem of their manipulated world wars to encourage more cooperation betweenthe countries of Europe. Once they had the free trade area, their foot in thedoor, they began to expand its powers until it became the fully fledgedpolitical and economic dictatorship that it is today. As I write, the plans havebeen revealed to introduce a new ‘European Constitution’ that would install aPresident of the European Union, a Foreign Secretary, and turn the countries ofEurope into mere regions of the super-state.One of the organisations within the Illuminati web is called the BilderbergGroup and it has had a policy for a centrally-controlled United States of Europesince its official formation in May, 1954. Britain was taken into the Europeanfly-trap by Prime Minister Ted Heath (Bilderberg Group), and this policy wassupported by his ‘opposition’ Labour Party of Harold Wilson (Bilderberg Group),James Callaghan (Bilderberg Group) and Denis Healey (Bilderberg Group). The newEuropean Union constitution was officially proposed by former French presidentValery Giscard d’Estaing (Bilderberg Group) and is supported by Tony Blair(Bilderberg Group). I have been writing for years that one of the reasons TonyBlair was placed in office was to take Britain into the single Europeancurrency, the euro, and a centrally-dictated United States of Europe. This iswhy, no matter what the arguments are against this surrender of freedom, or thepublic feeling about these plans, he has sought to press the changes through. Hehas refused demands for a referendum on the European constitution because heknows he would lose. The referendum he was forced to promise on the euro willinvolve Illuminati operatives from all areas of society, frightening the publicinto agreement with threats of economic disaster if we don’t give up sterling.The same superstate structure is planned to be introduced through the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation(APEC), the ‘free trade area’ for Asia and Australia; and the African Union thatreplaced the Organisation of African Unity in 2001. I said in And The TruthShall Set You Free in 1995 that the NAFTA ‘free trade area’ would be expanded tothe whole of the Americas as the next stepping stone to a centrally controlledAmerican Union. In 2001, George W. Bush attended the Summit of the Americas inQuebec, Canada, at which this expansion of NAFTA throughout the Americas wasagreed.Look at today’s newspapers and television news bulletins and you seeproblem-reaction-solution and the totalitarian tip-toe played out day after day.One extremely effective way to see through this manipulation is to keep askingyourself a simple question when faced with these daily situations: “Who benefitsfrom me believing this version of events, or accepting the solutions and changesbeing offered as a result?” The answer will be almost every time: anyone whowishes to centralise power and suppress more of our freedoms. Politics,economics, big business, the military, the media, religion and all the rest arepart of a vast web of inter-connected manipulation designed to persuade themasses to put themselves in prison and throw away the key. The Illuminati workthrough every belief system – religious, political, economic, racial andcultural – and through every side in the major ‘debates’. If you want to knowthe outcome of a game before the game has even started, you need to control allsides. The manager of a football team cannot dictate the result if he onlycontrols one side. If, however, he is managing both sides, he can ensure theresult he wants before a ball is kicked. So it is with the Illuminati, theHidden Hand behind the events that effect our lives and our world every day. Weshould be aware, when contemplating what happened in New York, Washington andPennsylvania on September 11th, that the Illuminati operate through secretsocieties in the Near and Middle East every bit as much as they do in the UnitedStates and the so-called ‘West’. We see this manipulation of both sides in theprotests against globalisation. To control the public perception of thesegathering protests the Illuminati have organised their own agents provocateur tostart the violence we see on the news broadcasts. Mainstream journalists watchedthe police lines open up at one protest in Spain to allow a group with weaponsand masked faces to walk through to the peacefully protesting crowd. This groupthen started to attack each other, thus ‘justifying’ a police charge on thepeaceful gathering in which people were battered by these uniformed head cases.Once the police intervention had begun, the journalists watched the group whostarted the trouble walk calmly back through the police lines to be driven awayin police vehicles. One was asked if he was a policeman. “Yes” was his firstreply when caught off-guard, but he then denied it.Done dealIt is the totalitarian tip-toe that explains why political leaders push aheadwith policies no matter what the evidence or the views of the people. They arefollowing the agenda and nothing is allowed to get in the way. The invasion ofIraq is an obvious case. This was decided long before it happened, as we shallsee, but George Bush and Tony Blair continued to say that war was not inevitablewhen they knew the date the troops were going in. Public ‘debate’ is just partof the smokescreen to hide the agenda and give the people the illusion that theylive in a free and open society. The European superstate, fluoride in publicdrinking water and genetically modified food are all examples of the ‘done deal’with regard to Britain while Tony Blair tells the people they are not. Themanipulation of the ‘debate’ in the United Kingdom on genetically modified or‘GM’ food is a classic of its kind. Blair said he wanted a public debate on theissue and then delayed all scientific reports into the potential (lethal)dangers of it until after the ‘debate’ had taken place. Michael Meacher, theSecretary of State for the Environment sacked by Blair in 2003, has sincehighlighted the lack of research and the serious risk posed by GM food. He hasalso confirmed that Tony Blair appeared uninterested in the science and wasdetermined that GM food be given the go ahead. Of course that is the case. GMfood worldwide is the Illuminati plan because it will (a) create the health andgenetic changes in humans that they want to introduce; (b) undermine the humanimmune system; and (c) make every grower on the planet, no matter how poor,dependent on the seeds of the transnationals (Illuminati) and the prices theycharge for them. Control and population reduction is what GM food is all about.The corporation behind GM foods is the truly appalling Monsanto in St Louis,Missouri, that has been featured many times in my books. It is Illuminati to itsfingertips and the Bush administration is awash with its personnel.When you question the Blair (Illuminati) line, as with Bush in the UnitedStates, the consequences can be brutal. Dr Arpad Pusztai is considered the worldexpert on GM food with more than 270 published studies relating to the subject.He was working at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, when he wasinterviewed for a World in Action television documentary on August 10th, 1998.What he said was to destroy his career because of the reaction of Tony Blair. DrPusztai told the programme that rats fed on certain GM potatoes had sufferedstunted growth, damage to the immune system and their liver, heart and otherorgans got smaller. He later said this was also the case with the brain, but hehad not mentioned that to avoid being “alarmist”. He said of GM food: “If I hadthe choice I would certainly not eat it.” 19 On the evening the interview wasbroadcast, Dr Pusztai was congratulated for his contribution by Professor PhilipJames, Director of the Rowett Institute. The next morning the Institute issued apress release highlighting that a “range of carefully controlled studiesunderlie the basis of Dr Pusztai’s concerns”.20 Forty eight hours later he wassuspended and ordered to hand over all his data. His research team was disbandedand he was threatened with legal action if he spoke to anyone on the subject.Even his personal assistant was banned from talking to him and he was alerted toan Institute press release that his contract was not being renewed. His wife wasalso sacked. Dr Pusztai was to have two heart attacks and his wife was put onpermanent medication for high blood pressure. The Rowett Institute lied and liedabout the reasons for their disgraceful treatment of Dr Pusztai, as was laterproved. The truth was that his comments on GM food, coming from such a worldclass source, had threatened to blow apart the Illuminati plan. He had to bedestroyed with the usual vindictiveness.Dr Pusztai is certain that his demise was caused by Tony Blair. He says that theday after the World in Action programme, two phone calls were made by Blair’soffice to his boss, Philip James, and the next day he was fired.21 Dr Pusztaisays he was told by a senior manager at Rowett that Blair’s intervention wasprompted by a phone call from United States President Bill Clinton. The storywas confirmed by Professor Robert Orskov, one the Britain’s top nutritionresearchers, who worked for Rowett for 33 years. He said he was told that phonecalls went from Monsanto to Clinton and then to Blair. “Clinton rang Blair andBlair rang James”, he said. “There is no doubt he was pushed by Blair to dosomething. It was damaging the relationship between the United States and theUnited Kingdom because it was going to be a huge blow for Monsanto.” 22 DavidHill, the director of Good Relations, the Monsanto public relations company inthe UK, ran the media campaign for Blair’s Labour Party in the General Electionvictories of 1997 and 2001.23 Another eminent researcher, Stanley Ewen, saidthat he was told the same story by another senior figure at Rowett:> “That conversation is sealed in my mind. My jaw dropped to the floor. I> suddenly saw it all – it was the missing link. Until then, I couldn’t> understand how on Monday Arpad had made the most wonderful breakthrough, and> on Tuesday it was the most dreadful piece of work and rejected out of hand.”> 24 The vicious campaign against Dr Pusztai was as coordinated as it was callous.Reports attacking him were published by the Illuminati Royal Society – thescientific establishment exposed in my other books – and by the Science andTechnology Select Committee of the House of Commons with its pro-Blair majority.Cabinet minister Jack Cunningham, another Blair lapdog, condemned Dr Pusztai’s“wholly misleading results” and said that all GM food in Britain would be safeto eat.25 But how does a prat like Cunningham know that, compared with theworld’s leading authority? It has nothing to do with truth or protecting thepublic. It is political business. GM food is a done deal. The Blair governmentis one of the most corrupt in all British history and it has fundamental ties tothe biotech industry. In its first two years in office GM food companies metgovernment officials and ministers 81 times.26 Blair’s unelected ScienceMinister, Lord Sainsbury, is a dedicated supporter of GM food. When he wasappointed he held large shareholdings in the biotech companies, Diatech andInnotech, which were placed in a ‘blind trust’ so that he could not knowinglybenefit from decisions he makes in government. Oh please. Has he forgotten hehas them then? He made £20 million profit in four years from Innotech and suchwealth allows him to be the biggest single donor to Blair’s Labour Party withpayments of more than £8 million since it came to power.27 But what of ProfessorJames, the head of Rowett, who also felt the wrath of dictator Blair? At thetime he enjoyed good relations with Blair and had been chosen to head theplanned Food Standards Agency. But that changed after Dr Pusztai made hiscomments. “You destroyed me”, he told Dr Pusztai.28 This is how the Illuminatiwork to stifle dissent and mislead the public. You want to advance your career?OK, do what we want and you’ll be fine. Speak your mind and we’ll destroy you.Anyone still wonder why only sycophants surround these people?Fresh air moneyOne of the most important aspects of the bloodline-Illuminati control ofhumanity is the money system. The Illuminati financial sting is very simple andspans the period from Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is based oncreating money that doesn’t exist and lending it to people and businesses inreturn for interest. This creates an enormous debt for governments, business andthe general population and allows you to control them. Vital to this has beenpermitting bankers to lend money they do not have. If you or I have a millionpounds we can lend a million pounds. But if a bank has a million pounds it canlend ten times that and more, and charge interest on it. If even a fraction ofthe people who theoretically have money deposited in a bank went today to removeit, the banks would slam the door in half an hour because they don’t have it.Money in the bank is a myth, another confidence trick. When you go into a bankand ask for a loan, the bank does not print a single new note, nor mint a singlenew coin. It merely types the amount of the loan into your account. From thatmoment you are paying interest to the bank on what is no more than figures typedon a screen. However, if you fail to pay back that non-existent loan, the bankcan come along and quite legally take your wealth that does exist, your home,land, car and possessions, to the estimated value of whatever figure was typedon to that screen – plus interest. More than that, because money is not broughtinto circulation by governments, but by private banks making loans to customers,the banks control how much money is in circulation. The more loans they chooseto make, the more money is in circulation. What is the difference between aneconomic boom (prosperity) and an economic depression (poverty)? One thing only– the amount of money in circulation. Through this system, the private banks,controlled by the same Illuminati families, decide how much money will be incirculation. They can create booms and busts at will. It is the same with thestock markets through which these families are moving trillions of dollars a dayaround the financial and banking system and deciding if they go up or down, soaror crash. Stock market crashes don’t just happen – they are made to happen. Whywould the Illuminati do this when they have so much money invested in thesemarkets? If you know the crash is coming because you are going to cause it, youknow to sell at the highest point and buy back in once the crash has happened.In this way you can increase your holdings massively by acquiring companies at afraction of the cost before your manipulated collapse.Most of the ‘money’ in circulation is not physical money: cash and coins. It isrepresented by figures passing from one computer account to anotherelectronically via money transfers, credit cards and cheque-books. The moremoney, electronic or otherwise, that is in circulation, the more economicactivity can take place and the more products are bought and sold, the moreincome people have and the more jobs are available. But a constant theme of thisIlluminati financial coup has been to create a boom by making lots of loans andthen pulling the plug, causing a depression or crash. Overpaid economists andeconomic correspondents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tellyou that boom and bust is part of some natural ‘economic cycle’. It is not. Itis systematic manipulation by the Illuminati to steal the real wealth of theworld. During a boom many people get themselves into more debt. The vibranteconomic activity means that businesses borrow more for new technology toincrease production to meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger house anda more expensive car because they are so confident of their economic prospects.Then, at the most opportune moment, the major banks, coordinated by theIlluminati network, raise interest rates to suppress the demand for loans andbegin to call in loans already outstanding. They ensure they make far fewerloans than before. This has the effect of taking units of exchange (money in itsvarious forms) out of circulation. This suppresses demand for products and leadsto fewer jobs because there is not enough money in circulation to generate thenecessary economic activity. People and businesses can no longer earn enough torepay their loans and they go bankrupt. The banks then take over their realwealth, their business, home, land, car and other possessions – in return fornon-repayment of a loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen.This has been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the lastfew centuries, and the real wealth of the world has been sucked out of thepopulation and into the hands of those who control the banking system – theIlluminati bloodline families. The same applies to countries. Instead ofcreating their own interest-free money, governments borrow it from the privatebanking cartel and pay the interest and the capital (sometimes) by taxation ofthe people. A fantastic amount of the money that you pay in taxes goes straightto the private banks to pay back loans of ‘money’, which governments couldcreate themselves interest free! Why don’t they do it? The Illuminati controlthe governments as much as they control the banks. What we call ‘privatisation’is the selling of state assets in response to bank-created debt. The world’spoorest countries are handing over control of their land and resources to theIlluminati bankers because they can’t pay back the loans made, on purpose, bythe banks to ensnare them in this very situation. The world does not have to bein poverty and conflict. It is manipulated to be that way because it serves theagenda. ‘Third World’ debt was manufactured to replace physical occupation ofresource-rich or strategically situated countries under colonialism with today’sfinancial occupation. The way they created this situation is told in detail inAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free. Once a country is indebted to foreign banks,even though the money is non-existent credit, they are forced to hand overcontrol of their affairs to the bankers, the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund, which then dictate economic and social policy at every level. Itall leads to the same cabal, the Illuminati, and the same word: control.One other point to emphasise is the way that we are paying for our own prison atevery turn. The Illuminati own the banking system and every time we put money ina bank or borrow from one we are funding the agenda for global dictatorship. Itis the same when we buy from transnational corporations, like the food, fuel anddrugs that people purchase from the food, oil and pharmaceutical cartels. Thinkof everything we buy from the Illuminati global network of companies – includingtelevision and the rest of the media – and every time we are filling the coffersof our prison builders. But it doesn’t stop there. The Illuminati also controlthe governments and how their money is spent. Our tax money funds the agenda andwe are taxed on everything: our income, what we buy, even what we insure. Almostevery human activity is taxed. If you worked out how much of our income weactually keep when we take all this into account we would be staggered at howmuch is taken by those who claim to be serving us. Even sex is taxed – and how.When the rubber is imported for a condom, the government charges a tax. Thecompany making the condom is taxed for buying the rubber and on the profit itmakes from the sale, and the employees are taxed on their wages. The companytransporting the condom to the shops is taxed on the profit and there are taxesfor using their vehicles. The driver is taxed on his income. The shop sellingthe condoms is taxed on the profit and the person who makes the sale is taxed ontheir wages. The customer is then charged sales tax, what we call VAT inBritain, for the privilege of buying the condom. No doubt there will soon be atax on using it. Speeding and parking fines are another form of taxation andon-road parking is a perfect example of how we are manipulated to pay for thesame thing many times. In this case we pay through taxation for the roads to bebuilt and maintained (when often they are not); we pay road tax for the right touse our car; we pay massive tax to the government in the fuel we buy and when wehave our vehicles serviced and repaired; then, having paid out all this, we areforced to pay to park our cars on the very roads we have already paid for. If wedon’t we are fined and that money also goes to the Illuminati governmentalsystem. Speed cameras are not there to stop accidents; they are another sourceof revenue for the authorities to use to further imprison us. Everywhere youlook we are financing our own prison cell.Criminal bankruptcyWhen you begin to look behind the movie screen or more appropriately under thestone, you see a very different world to the one portrayed on CNN. Someresearchers and lawyers reveal that in the 1930s the United States, Britain,France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and many others officially declaredbankruptcy, but somehow forgot to tell the people. This apparently happenedduring the years of the Geneva Conventions in Switzerland between 1928 and 1932,but it seems that they don’t publish the volume containing the details of thebankruptcy declarations. The bankers said that either the countries declaredbankruptcy to the Illuminati banks or there would be no loans to get them out ofthe deep global depression at that time. They accepted official bankruptcy tothe global banking system and this meant, in effect, that the banks have ownedthose countries ever since.29 Actually, I say countries, but the United Statesis not a country, but a corporation, as revealed in my previous books and manyother published works and studies. No doubt we will find that the situation isthe same in other countries too. This bankruptcy is in the United StatesCongressional Record of March 17th 1993 (Vol. 33, page H-1303). James TraficantJr of Ohio told the House:> “Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest> reorganization of any Bankrupt entity in world history, the US Government. We> are setting forth hopefully, a blueprint for our future. There are some who> say it is a coroner’s report that will lead to our demise. > “It is an established fact that the United States Federal Government has been> dissolved by the Emergency Banking Act, March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1, Public Law> 89-719; declared by President Roosevelt, being bankrupt and insolvent.

Our children will inherit this> un-payable debt, and the tyranny to enforce paying it.” James Traficant was later jailed for alleged bribery and corruption because hewas getting too close to the truth on many issues affecting the Illuminatiagenda. The United States Corporation was created behind the screen of a‘Federal Government’ when, after the manufactured ‘victory’ in the American Warof ‘Independence’, the British colonies exchanged overt dictatorship from Londonwith the far more effective covert dictatorship that has been in place eversince. In effect, the Virginia Company, the corporation headed by the BritishCrown that controlled the ‘former’ colonies, simply changed its name to theUnited States and other related pseudonyms. These include the US, USA, UnitedStates of America, Washington DC, District of Columbia, Federal Government and‘Feds’. The United States Corporation is based in the District of Columbia andthe current president of the Corporation is a man called George W. Bush. He isnot the president of the people or the country as they are led to believe,that’s just the smokescreen. This means that Bush launched a ‘war on terrorism’on behalf of a private Corporation to further the goals of that Corporation. Ithad nothing to do with ‘America’ or ‘Americans’ because these are very differentlegal entities. It is the United States Corporation that owns the United Statesmilitary and everything else that comes under the term ‘federal’. This includesthe Federal Reserve, the ‘central bank’ of the United States, which is, inreality, a private bank owned by controlling stockholders (and controllers ofthe US Corporation) that are not even American.This is the bank from which the United States Corporation borrows ‘money’. TheFederal Reserve was manipulated into existence in 1913 and dictates the UnitedStates interest rate that has a massive knock-on effect on the rest of theworld. The Federal Reserve or ‘Fed’ is currently headed by Alan Greenspan, amember of Illuminati front organisations like the Bilderberg Group, Council onForeign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. His predecessor was Paul W.Volker of … the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and theTrilateral Commission (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The United StatesCorporation is owned by families and forces in Europe and the Jesuit-controlledVatican is at the heart of this covert ownership of not only the United States,but major European ‘countries’ like the United Kingdom also (see Appendix I).‘Floating’ courtsThe privately owned Corporation known as the United States is the holdingcompany, if you like, and the 50 states are its subsidiaries. This means thatthese states also declared bankruptcy, or had it declared for them by theholding company, the ‘Federal Government’, but the people never knew and stilldon’t. You can get the detail about this elsewhere and I am only summarising thesituation to give people an idea of how deep this conspiracy really goes. Thesting has been set up so that when you register with the ‘Federal Government’ inany way by accepting a Social Security number, driver’s licence, or any of theother official federal documents, you are, unknowingly, agreeing to become anasset-employee of the United States Corporation. From that moment you becomeresponsible for financing the Corporation’s state of bankruptcy. When you paytaxes or a court or parking fine and such like, you are servicing the bankruptcyby paying that money to ‘government’ agencies that are nothing more thandebt-collecting agencies for the creditor banks. The US court system operatesunder corporate law or the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to administer thebankruptcy and fleece the sheep to pay back the ongoing debt. This is also knownas British Maritime (military) Law and this is why the American flag always hasa gold fringe when displayed in the courts of the United States. You find thesame in government buildings, federally funded schools and on US militaryuniforms. The gold fringe is a legal symbol indicating that the court is sittingunder British Maritime Law and the Uniform Commercial Code – military andmerchant law not common or constitutional law. Under the Admiralty Law of Flags,the flag displayed gives notice of the law under which the ship (in this casethe court) is regulated. Anyone entering that ship (court) accepts by doing sothat they are submitting to the law indicated by that flag. Judges refuse toreplace the flag with one without a fringe when asked by defendants who know thescore because that changes the law under which the court is sitting. If youappear in a court with a gold-fringed flag your constitutional rights aresuspended and you are being tried under British Maritime (military/merchant)Law. The Uniform Commercial Code was approved by the American Bar Association,which is a franchise, a subordinate branch, of the British legal system and itshierarchy based in London’s Temple district (named after the Illuminati KnightsTemplar secret society). As I have been writing for many years, the power thatcontrols America is based in Britain and Europe because that is where the poweris located that owns the United States Corporation. By the way, if you think itis strange that a court on dry land could be administered under Maritime Law,look at US Code, Title 18 B 7. It says that Admiralty Jurisdiction is applicablein the following locations: (1) the high seas; (2) any American ship; (3) anylands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under theexclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased orotherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of thestate. In other words, mainland America. All this is founded on Roman lawbecause the Illuminati have been playing this same game throughout the centurieswherever they have gone. The major politicians know that this is how things areand so do the government administrators, judges, lawyers and insider‘journalists’.Those who realise what is happening and ask the court for the name of the truecreditor or recipients of the fines imposed by the ‘legal system’ are alwaysrefused this information by the judge. The true creditors in such cases, and theultimate recipient of the fines, are the bankers to which the Corporation‘country’ is bankrupt. More and more people in the United States are refusing toregister in any way with the Federal Government, as news and documentation ofthis bizarre situation continues to circulate. If the authorities can keep thisfantastic deceit from the mass of the people since the 1930s, you can appreciatewhy they were confident they could ensure that what really happened on September11th stays comfortably under wraps. Throughout this book I will refer to what isthought to be the government of ‘America’ as the United States or the US, andwhen I talk of the ‘US government’ and similar terms, I am referring to theprivately owned United States Corporation that is masquerading as the‘government’. It is not the government of a nation or country, it is a privateCorporation acting purely in the interests of the families that own and controlit. The ‘American’ president is the Corporation’s chief executive officer.The (shitty) CityIt is the same story in the United Kingdom. When the authorities talk of the‘The Crown’, they are not referring to the King or Queen, but ‘The City’, aprivately owned Corporation (sovereign state) consisting of 677 acres at theheart of the urban sprawl known as ‘Greater London’. ‘The City’ has a populationof 5,000 while Greater London is home to eight million, but in that small areamassive global power is wielded. ‘The Crown’ is actually a committee of 12 to 14men who rule the independent sovereign state known as ‘The City’, which is not apart of England and not subject to the Sovereign nor the rule of Parliament. Itis headed by a Lord Mayor who is elected for one year and is always a Freemason.The sitting monarch has to bow to the Mayor when he or she wishes to enter theCity and must ask for his permission. He meets the monarch at Temple Bar, namedafter the Knights Templar. I have included more background to the City and itssecret society web in The Biggest Secret, but this is where the United Kingdomand much of the wider world is governed from – including the United States andCanada. The British Prime Minister and his or her government are subordinate tothese people just like the monarch. The British monarch is also a subordinaterepresentative of the Pope (in other words the Illuminati network that controlsthe Vatican, especially the Jesuits). One confirmation of this was the PeaceTreaty between the American Colonies and the British ‘Crown’ (‘The City’) in1783, which states the following:> “It having pleased the Divine Providence to dispose the hearts of the most> serene and most potent Prince George the Third, by the grace of God, king of> Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, duke of Brunswick> and Lunebourg, arch-treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire> etc., and of the United States of America …” (My emphasis.) Img [../Images/00010.jpg]Figure 5: Two track reality: the Illuminati agenda hides behind a ‘movie’version of events sold to the people through the media. “Bin Laden did it” and“weapons of mass destruction” are perfect examples The United Kingdom, or rather ‘The City’, controls the United States, yes, butas a vassal of the Roman Church, which owns Great Britain and Ireland (seeAppendix I).There you have a summary of the background and history to the global conspiracyand the techniques used to hoodwink the people into believing they are free whentheir most fundamental rights to freedom of expression and freedom of choice arebeing curtailed by the day. The Illuminati agenda for the centralised globaldictatorship and the ‘movie’ to fool the people are running side by side. Theyare two ‘tracks’ or story boards (Figure 5). Track one is the ‘agenda’ – thesecret agenda for global control; track two is the public ‘movie’ – the versionof events ‘reported’ through the mainstream media that is designed to hide theagenda and justify its introduction. When the ‘agenda’ requires something to bedone, the ‘movie’ is scripted to sell the people a cover story for why thatneeds to happen. When the ‘agenda’ requires the conquest of Iraq, the moviebangs out the mantra of ‘weapons of mass destruction’. When it demands theconquest of Afghanistan, the ‘movie’ tells the populous that Bin Laden wasbehind 9/11 and he is based in Afghanistan supported by the Taliban. The reasonso many lies can be identified in the cover stories is because that is just whatthey are: stories. They are inventions to dupe the people into accepting anotherstage of an agenda they have no idea exists. These ‘double tracks’ also explainwhy you find the people involved with the secret ‘agenda’ are also supplyingweapons to the very dictators they say must be removed because of those weapons.Once you realise how the game works it is no longer a mystery why those offeringthe solutions are those creating the problems in the first place.SOURCES > 1 Albert Pike Morals and Dogma of the Ancient And Accepted Scottish Rite of> Freemasonry (prepared for the Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree for the> Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, Charleston, 1871).

I am going to look in detail at the appallingevents that have followed 9/11, especially the invasion of Iraq and the ‘war onterrorism’, because the Hidden Hand of the Illuminati and their methods ofoperation could not be more obvious. Understanding this is vital to preventing arepeat throughout the world.I have described the background to the invasion of Afghanistan in considerabledetail in Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster. They used theexcuse of their own terrorist attacks on September 11th to invade a stone-agecountry in the middle of a famine and impose their own regime under the puppetleadership of Hamid Karsai. He is reported to be a former advisor to the majorTexas-based oil company, Unocal, which planned to build an oil and gas pipelinefrom the Caspian Sea region across western Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea coastof Pakistan, but could not do so while the Taliban were in power. There is anIlluminati frenzy to control and tap the enormous reserves of oil and gas aroundthe Caspian Sea and, because it is land locked, they need to build pipelines totransport it to world markets. Countries like Afghanistan and Iran are on thepotential pipeline routes (Figure 6). Unocal had no problem negotiating with theTaliban through the 1990s to build their pipelines across Afghanistan and nordid the US State Department. However, public opposition to the deal in the faceof the Taliban’s human rights abuses, not least against women, made the dealimpossible. Unocal pulled out of the project in 1997 saying that the pipelinecould not be built until an internationally recognised regime was in power inAfghanistan. Thanks to 9/11 and the claims that the ‘Afghanistan-located’CIA-asset, Osama bin Laden, was responsible (based on no evidence), theIlluminati-controlled United States and British governments could send in thebombers to remove the Taliban and replace them with Hamid Karsai.Image [../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 6: The pig-trough frenzy to control the massive Caspian Sea oil and gasreserves is one major reason why the US government, supported by Britain’s TonyBlair, targeted Afghanistan after 9/11. This is the approximate route of theUnocal pipeline On December 31st 2002, after the removal of the Taliban, George W. Bushappointed a man called Zalmay Khalilzad as his ‘special envoy’ to Afghanistan tooversee the ‘transition’ to the new post-Taliban regime. Khalilzad, anIlluminati operative, was chief consultant to Unocal on the Afghanistan pipelineproject! He co-wrote in the winter 2000 issue of The Washington Quarterly:“Afghanistan could prove a valuable corridor for this [Caspian Sea] energy aswell as for access to markets in Central Asia.” He had tried to overcome theproblem that the Taliban was not internationally recognised by publicly lobbyingfor the US government to ‘re-engage’ with the regime that caused untold murder,torture and suffering, and he defended the Taliban against allegations ofsponsoring terrorism.1 It was partly on Khalilzad’s advice that the ClintonAdministration funded the Taliban through Pakistan intelligence, even paying thesalaries of high-ranking Taliban officials.2 So long as the Taliban played thegame with the pipeline, who cares what they do to their people? When this planwent pear-shaped and the pipeline had to be shelved, Khalilzad changed hisposition to suit the circumstances. As a State and Defense Department officialduring the Reagan-Bush administration, he helped to supply the Mujahadeen withweapons during Afghanistan’s occupation by the Soviet Union, the period whenOsama bin Laden and al-Qaeda were funded and armed by the United States.As Bush’s special envoy to Afghanistan, it was Khalilzad who helped to overseethe change-over from the ‘transitional’ government led by fellow Unocal frontman, Hamid Karsai, to the fully-fledged ‘Afghanistan’ government with Karsaiagain the puppet president answerable to the United States. As a result of this,the pipeline that Karsai and Khalilzad were both employed to make happen, is nowgoing ahead. Surprised? Khalilzad comes from one of the old ruling elitefamilies in Afghanistan and his father was an aide to King Zahir Shah, who ruledthe country until he went into exile in 1973. Thanks to the installation ofHamid Karsai, a representative of Zahir Shah, the king returned to thePresidential Palace in Kabul in 2002. Since the removal of the Taliban the opiumproduction in Afghanistan has soared to fuel the heroin market, controlled bythe Bush family and their associates and masters, exactly as planned. ZalmayKhalilzad was later appointed by Bush to be his envoy to Iraq, so he could playthe same scam there in arranging for a US- controlled ‘Iraqi’ government toreplace Saddam Hussein. More about Khalilzad shortly – there is plenty to know.According to planThe invasion of Afghanistan, like 9/11, had been planned for a long time and itwas the same with the conquest of Iraq in the spring of 2003. Time magazinereported that during a briefing for three senators by the National SecurityAdvisor, Condoleezza Rice, in March 2002, President Bush poked his head into aWhite House meeting room and bellowed, “Fuck Saddam. We’re taking him out!” 3This was a year before the invasion and yet, only weeks before the troops wentin, we had Bush, Blair and their fellow travellers in government still sayingthat war was not inevitable!! If they ever told the truth they would have aseizure from the shock. The plan to take control of the Gulf region using SaddamHussein as the excuse was in place long before Bush and the rest of hisIlluminati mafia were illegally placed in power against the will of the peoplein late 2000. An article by writer Nicholas Lemann in the New Yorker revealedthat after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, Dick Cheney, now the VicePresident, formed a group to plan a strategy for the 1990s and beyond.4 Thisgroup included the current Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the currentDeputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, the current Secretary of State ColinPowell and Lewis ‘Scooter’ Libby, Cheney’s chief of staff. The aim was to‘shape’ the world in their desired image or, as another member, ZalmayKhalilzad, put it … to “preclude the rise of another global rival for theindefinite future”. Yes, the same Zalmay ‘Unocal’ Khalilzad who would be namedBush’s special envoy to Afghanistan before 9/11 followed by the same role inIraq at the time of the invasion. Lemann says he was shown a copy of thedocument Cheney’s group put together called Defense Strategy for the 1990s: TheRegional Defense Strategy, Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, January 1993. Thiswas the month that Bill Clinton was inaugurated and Cheney and father Bush leftoffice. This ‘strategy’, planned in the early 1990s, is pretty much what the boyBush and Cheney government is doing today – a government controlled by thepeople who put the document together. The ‘war on terrorism’ was a response toSeptember 11th? Sure.Still more confirmation of this came with the publication of a secret documentproduced for the yet-to-be-not-elected Bush administration in September 2000, ayear before 9/11 and two and half years before the troops were sent into Iraq.The document was called Rebuilding America’s Defenses: Strategies, Forces andResources For A New Century, and was produced by the neo-conservative‘think-tank’ called The Project for the New American Century (PNAC). You canread it in full at the PNAC website.5 This organisation was created in 1997 bypeople like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and the report was produced forthemselves and other highly significant names that are today at the heart of theBush administration, including Paul Wolfowitz, now Rumsfeld’s deputy at thePentagon, and Lewis Libby, Cheney’s chief of staff. Bush’s younger brother, Jeb,the governor of Florida during the rigged presidential election, was alsoinvolved. The usual crowd in other words. Details of the document were publishedby the Sunday Herald in Scotland6 and the contents precisely mirror eventsinstigated since Bush and his controllers came to power. It is a blueprint forUS (Illuminati) global domination that reveals how Bush and his cabinet wereplanning to invade Iraq to secure ‘regime change’ even before they entered theWhite House in January 2001. The PNAC report says:> “The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in> Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the> immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in> the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.” 7 Note that phrase “provides the immediate justification”. This is why Bush,Blair, Powell and Co lied and lied and used bogus “intelligence” to desperatelymake a case for the war in Iraq. They didn’t have a reason, so they had toinvent one, as they did with Afghanistan, to follow the hidden agenda. Theirfirst choice was ‘weapons of mass destruction’, a term that was repeated overand over on the basis of the more times you say something the more people arelikely to believe you. As with ‘Bin Laden did it’, there was no proof or evenevidence, only constant repetition of what they want the public to believe (seeAlice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster for the Bin Ladenbackground). When Hans Blix and his UN weapons inspectors found nothing tosupport the claims about weapons of mass destruction, Blair and Powell becameever more desperate, detailing “compelling intelligence” that the weaponsexisted. This ‘evidence’ turned out to be stolen virtually word for word from ananalysis written 12 years earlier by a postgraduate student in California, butit was presented to the public as the work of British intelligence. It waslifted from an article by Ibrahim al Mirashi and even spelling and punctuationerrors from the original were repeated. They did, however, change words to makethem sound more sinister. Iraqi intelligence “monitoring foreign embassies inIraq”, became “spying on foreign embassies in Iraq”. Even that is nothing morethan the CIA and British Intelligence do themselves. “Aiding opposition groupsin hostile regimes”, was upgraded to “supporting terrorist organizations inhostile regimes”.I’m too sexy for my liesAndrew Gilligan, a BBC Defence and Diplomatic correspondent, said he had beentold by a significant source (later confirmed as British weapons inspector, DrDavid Kelly) that a ‘dossier’ on the Saddam ‘threat’ was changed by Blair’soffice on the orders of his minder and Spinner-in-Chief, Alastair Campbell.8 Theintelligence report had not been “very revelatory” when it arrived at DowningStreet, Gilligan says Kelly told him, but it was “transformed to make itsexier”. It was embellished to manipulate the people into supporting the war andincluded the outrageous claim that Saddam could deploy weapons of massdestruction in 45 minutes. Two other BBC reporters were told by Kelly in milderterms that the Blair press office (controlled by Campbell) changed the wordingof the dossier. Blair said the BBC story was “as serious an attack on myintegrity as there could possibly be”.9 But how can you attack something thatdoes not exist? Campbell was ‘cleared’ of the ‘sexing up’ allegation by acommittee of MPs only on the casting vote of the chairman, a member of Blair’sown Labour Party. This was done even though the committee acknowledged that itswork had been “hampered” by the refusal to allow them access to intelligencepapers and security services personnel! Hampered?? How can they make a decisionabout Campbell when they can’t even interview those involved? They have to takehis word for it, basically. Outrageous. Campbell later announced he wasresigning as Blair’s ‘Mr Spin’, but the manipulation of the public mind willcontinue because lies are essential to the cover story.Then came the strange death of Dr Kelly, the source of Gilligan’s report. He was‘outed’ by Geoff Hoon’s Ministry of Defence after he told them that he metGilligan and could be the source of the report that had caused the government tomake concerted attacks on the BBC. Kelly was given a rough time by theBlair-controlled House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee when he appearedbefore them to be questioned about what happened. A few days later he went for awalk in the countryside near his home in Oxfordshire and did not return. He wasfound in a secluded wood with his wrist cut and the official story was that hecommitted suicide and bled to death. The inference was that the pressure hadmade him do it. But this is the same David Kelly who faced the wrath of theSaddam regime as a weapons inspector after the 1991 Gulf War and coped withsomething similar from Russian officials during an investigation there. This guycould stand his ground. Shortly before he left on his ‘suicide walk’ he emailedassociates with “combative” comments about the pressure he was under from “manydark actors playing games”. He said he hoped it would all blow over and he couldget back to Baghdad and get on with the work that really mattered. When he lefthis home, his wife, Janice, was unconcerned. Although she knew her 59-year-oldhusband was deeply upset, his mental state did not seem to be too down. Walkingwas a hobby and he often disappeared for up to two or three hours. Paul Weaver,a local farmer, greeted Kelly as he strode through the fields close to his homeand there was nothing to suggest a suicidal man. “He smiled and said hello”,Weaver recalled.10 Kelly had family matters to look forward to like the marriageof one of his daughters in October. He was devoted to his wife and family and hedid not show signs of someone who was about to kill himself. But then he wasfound dead, the police say, in an isolated wood with his wrist slashed with apen knife. There was no goodbye to his wife and family, nothing. Does this makesense to you? Me neither. He was clearly murdered because of what he knew.Blair’s Ministry of Mendacity also said there was a link between Saddam andal-Qaeda until intelligence sources leaked the news that they had found no suchconnection. Intelligence professionals in the United States have taken a similarline. A group of retired intelligence operatives said in a letter to PresidentBush: “There is one unpardonable sin. Cooking intelligence to the recipe of highpolicy. There is ample evidence that this has been done in Iraq.” 11 A member ofthe Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency told the New York Times: “TheAmerican people were manipulated.” 12 Clare Short, who resigned as Blair’sinternational development secretary in protest at the spin, said he had misledthe public over the scale of the threat posed by Iraq to ensure support for thewar. “I have concluded that the PM decided to go to war in August sometime andhe duped us all along”, she told the Sunday Telegraph. “He had decided forreasons that he alone knows to go to war over Iraq and to create this sense ofurgency and drive it – the way the intelligence was spun was part of thatdrive.” 13 His reasons were to follow the agenda of his unseen masters who puthim into power and can either keep him there or cause his downfall. Short saidthat Blair secretly agreed with George Bush in the autumn of 2002 that theywould invade Iraq the following spring “come what may”.14 The secrecy thatfollowed, in which even Blair’s cabinet was kept out of the loop, hampered theplanning for the aftermath of the war and helped to produce the “chaos andsuffering” that ensued, she said. Decisions were made in Blair’s office in callsto President Bush, Short revealed, and in phone conversations between Blair’sforeign policy advisor, Sir David Manning, and US National Security Advisor,Condoleezza Rice. Short said Blair had lied about wanting a second UnitedNations resolution supporting the invasion; he had lied by claiming that Iraqwas “an immediate threat to us in 45 minutes”; and he lied that French PresidentJacques Chirac would veto a second resolution under any circumstances. This wasnot true, said Short.15 Tony Blair lies more often and more obviously than anyother British politician of modern times (despite the fierce competition) andone reason he gets away with it is because it is beyond the comprehension ofmany that anyone could lie so constantly and blatantly to the people he issupposed to serve. Well, he can and does – every day. So do Bush, Cheney,Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell and their cabal. They are following the techniquesof the Nazis, as outlined by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf:> “All propaganda must be so popular and on such an intellectual level that even> the most stupid of those toward whom it is directed will understand it. People> can be made to perceive paradise as hell, and the other way round, to consider> the most wretched sort of life as paradise.” 16 In the United States, leaked information from the Department of Defense revealedthat a top secret report by the Defense Intelligence Agency in September 2002concluded they could find no evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq. Some CIAofficials distanced themselves from the Bush administration claims that Iraqposed an imminent threat. They said these claims were based on information givendirectly to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld by Ahmed Chalabi, the leader ofthe CIA-funded Iraqi National Congress and the man the Pentagon would like to beleader of Iraqi. More about him later. Reports quoted CIA sources as saying thatChalabi’s ‘information’ was deeply suspect and largely based on hearsay fromother defectors with vested interests in regime change (they made it up). BobGraham, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the mediathat classified evidence that supported the Bush claims about Iraqi weapons wasmade public, but he said that as a member of the Intelligence Committee he sawmuch evidence that didn’t support its case. “That evidence was neverdeclassified”, he said. All this when the United States and Britain have accessto a satellite surveillance system that can read your number plate from spaceand this is how the Airman magazine described the capabilities of the GlobalHawk unmanned surveillance plane deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq:> “On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval> Weapons Center at China Lake, California. The images it gathered were so clear> that an electro-optical image stands out next to an F/A-18 Fighter. An> infrared image showed where concrete had cooled down from the shadow of a> C-130 that had recently taken off.” 17 And they couldn’t locate ‘weapons of mass destruction’? Or find Bin Laden? OrSaddam Hussein?Fakes and fantasyColin Powell and the United States claimed that a document existed to show thatNiger had sold uranium to Iraq for nuclear weapons. This ‘document’ was exposedas a crude fake by the International Atomic Agency. Joseph Wilson, the USambassador to Gabon from 1992 to 1995, wrote in the New York Times how he hadbeen hired by the CIA to investigate the alleged Niger connection and had foundno evidence. He communicated his findings to the US government and he said:“Based on my experience with the administration in the months leading up to thewar, I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence relatedto Iraq’s nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.”18 They lied. Powell told NBC: “It was the information that we had. We providedit. If that information is inaccurate, fine.” 19 No, darlin’, it was informationyou made up to manipulate the people and that’s not fine. Quite simply, you werecaught lying, Mr. Powell, the exposure of which is hardly brain surgery.Remember how Powell presented his ‘evidence’ to the United Nations SecurityCouncil with his make-believe charts, ‘intelligence’ satellite photographs andrecordings of phone calls by Iraqi officials? All bullshit – and he knew it. Itwas the same with the drone aircraft that we were told could attack the eastcoast of the United States. Pure invention to sell a lie. When Bush and Co werecaught out on the ‘Iraq nuclear plans’ fabrication they arranged for the CIAchief, George Tenet, to take the blame to protect them. He said it had been aCIA “error”. At the same time the Americans were distancing themselves from the‘nuclear’ statements, Tony Blair was still saying the intelligence was correct.Mixed up the song sheets there then? Powell told the United Nations in February2003 that Saddam had authorised his field commanders to use chemical weapons. Sowhy weren’t they used when the US and Britain invaded? And why weren’t theweapons he authorised found when the Iraqi ‘army’ was overrun? The United StatesArmy commander in Iraq said after the war that nothing had been found to showthe country’s military was prepared to use them on US forces. Lieutenant-GeneralWilliam Wallace, commander of the army’s 5th Corps, said US forces had uncovered“no evidence of him trying to employ them directly against US troops”.20 Why thehell not? I thought Iraq’s ‘weapons of mass destruction’ were a threat to theworld and yet they aren’t even used to defend their own country from invasionand takeover? Powell was lying, as he was with his claims that Saddam’sweapon-making units were housed in trucks moving from place to place. It wouldbe laughable if the outcome of the mendacity had not been so tragic for thepeople of Iraq. Behind Powell when he made his UN address were blue drapes hungthat morning to cover a massive tapestry reproduction of Picasso’s famousanti-war painting called Guernica. The UN’s Stephane Dujaric, said: “We neededthe right background that would work on television.” Yeah, OK.Powell also said that they had intelligence proof that Saddam had weapons ofmass destruction, but could not give details for fear of exposing the informantsto danger. Excuse me if I fail to believe that people like Powell really give adamn about exposing anyone to danger so long as the agenda is served. And holdon. How would it expose informants to danger if the US had simply told the UNinspectors where to look? With Saddam’s regime removed, there was no danger atall to informants. So why didn’t the Americans immediately follow their‘intelligence proof’ and find the weapons? Years later nothing has been found.The British cabinet minister, David Blunkett, is a former ‘socialist’ and now,in my view, the most right wing Home Secretary of modern times. He said evenwhile the war was going on that no chemical, biological or nuclear weapons ofmass destruction may be found, and yet this was the ‘justification’ for the war.He said that, in any case, he rejoiced at the ‘fall’ of Saddam Hussein and hisregime regardless of whether any weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraqor not.21 Unbelievable.As the lies were exposed, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that Saddam mayhave destroyed the weapons before the war started! Er, so why was there a war?Why didn’t Saddam make this mass destruction very public to avoid being invaded?Rumsfeld’s ‘deputy’ and the real power in the Pentagon, Paul Wolfowitz, toldVanity Fair that the claims about Saddam’s weapons capability were used tojustify the war for “bureaucratic reasons”.22 It was “the one reason everyonecould agree on”, he said. The other factor he described as “huge” was that anattack would allow America to pull its troops from Saudi Arabia and resolve amajor grievance held by al-Qaeda. Oh, so the ‘war on terrorism’ involves givingin to the alleged terrorists, then? What nonsense. Pulling the troops out ofSaudi Arabia is part of a strategy that will eventually send them back in againto take the country over. But the best excuse for not finding weapons of massdestruction came, naturally, from George W. Bush. He said in his weekly radioaddress on Sunday, June 22nd 2003, that they had been looted!! When the allegedweapons were not found in Iraq it was claimed that the finding of mass graveswere justification enough for the war. What they didn’t tell you was that thosegraves were overwhelmingly the result of uprisings being put down by Saddamafter the 1991 Gulf conflict. These rebellions were encouraged by Presidentfather George Bush, who then refused to support them and left the people totheir fate – mass graves.Shooting the messengerThe United Nations’ Hans Blix said that American officials tried to discreditthe work of his weapons inspectors in Iraq to further their own case for war. Hetold the BBC of his “disquiet” at how the documents the International AtomicEnergy Agency “had no great difficulty finding out were fake”, managed to getthrough US and UK intelligence analysis. Also disturbing, he said, was thequestion of who was responsible for the falsification.23 As usual the fakedocuments to make the case for an Illuminati war did not “get through US and UKintelligence analysis”; they faked them in the first place, as per normal. Afterthe invasion the United States and Britain refused to allow Blix and the UNinspectors to return to Iraq to search for the alleged weapons. Instead, the USprovided its own inspection teams. Blix called for experts to return to thecountry to determine whether the weapons allegations had any foundation. Are youkidding? Does he really think the criminals in the US and Britishadministrations are really going to allow him back to prove they have been lyingall along? Tony Blair dismissed demands from members of his own Labour Party foran inquiry into how the public was misled about Saddam’s ‘weapons of massdestruction’ that were cited as the reason why the war was necessary. He knows aproper, truly independent inquiry, would expose his mendacity. Retired CIAintelligence analyst Ray McGovern, a member of Veteran IntelligenceProfessionals for Sanity, said:> “Some of my colleagues are virtually certain that there will be some weapons> of mass destruction found, even though they might have to be planted. I’m just> as sure that some few will be found, but not in an amount that by any stretch> would justify the charge of a threat against the US or anyone else. Even if> the planting was discovered by and by, they’ll say, ‘OK, the weapons were> planted – fine’.” 24 And remember: these genetic liars are the same people who have told the worldwhat happened on September 11th, who did it, and how – the official story of9/11 that has been used to ‘justify’ all that has followed.Coalition of make-believeThe idea that the invasion was about ‘liberating’ Iraqis is a grotesque joke.They were so desperate to sell the idea of an international ‘coalition’ thatthey included in their laughable list of supporting countries the SolomonIslands and Tonga. The Solomon Islands doesn’t even have a military! By March30th 2003, Donald Rumsfeld was telling Fox [propaganda] News that the‘coalition’ had now risen to 66 countries. It was simply another lie. AllanKemakeza, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, said his country was not partof the coalition, despite being listed.25 The Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Ropsaid the same and Croatia was listed even though its president, Stipe Mesic,condemned the war on Iraq as “illegitimate”.26 The Czech Republic was listedwhen its president, Vaclav Klaus, said that anyone who thinks democracy can beimposed on Iraq is “from another universe”.27 Or as investigative journalist,Wayne Madsen wrote in Counter Punch: “Klaus means that people like Bush, TonyBlair, Rumsfeld and the other neo- Crusaders are just plain nuts. Indeed theyare.”28 But if you haven’t got support, invent some. If you haven’t got anenemy, invent one. Author Joseph Schumpeter said of the [Illuminati] RomanEmpire: “There was no corner of the known world where some interest was notalleged to be in danger or under actual attack. If the interests were not Roman,they were those of Rome’s allies; and if Rome had no allies, the allies would beinvented.” 29The Bush message was: “If you support us we are going to war with Iraq, if youdon’t support us we are going to war with Iraq.” It’s the mentality of theplayground bully. People have asked why Bush and Blair would not listen toarguments for allowing UN weapons inspectors more time to search for the alleged‘weapons of mass destruction’ and took no account of the massive global protestsor opinions of other governments. The answer is that they were following theagenda of their unseen masters and nothing was going to divert them from that.They wouldn’t dare.Inmates control the asylumBlair, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw andtheir like, knew they were peddling false information for no other reason thanto provide the “immediate justification” to move into the Gulf in line with theIlluminati’s long-time strategy for global control. The Project for the NewAmerican Century report for the Bush cabal in September 2000 planned a“blueprint for maintaining global US pre-eminence, precluding the rise of agreat power rival, and shaping the international security order in line withAmerican principles and interests”.30 What it calls this “American grandstrategy” must be advanced for “as far into the future as possible” and it saysthat the US must “fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatrewars” as a “core mission”.31 American armed forces are described as “the cavalryon the new American frontier”.32 The report also said:> Allies like the UK are “the most effective and efficient means of exercising> American global leadership”. > Peacekeeping missions demand “American political leadership rather than that> of the United Nations”. > Even should Saddam pass from the scene, bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will> remain permanently, despite domestic opposition in the Gulf regimes to the> stationing of US troops, as “Iran may well prove as large a threat to US> interests as Iraq has”. > North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran are dangerous regimes and their existence> justifies the creation of a “world-wide command-and-control system” [World> Army]. > China should be targeted for “regime change” and the report says “it is time> to increase the presence of American forces in Southeast Asia” that may lead> to “American and allied power providing the spur to the process of> democratisation in China”. > “US Space Forces” should dominate space and it calls for the total control of> cyberspace to prevent “enemies” [anyone exposing the agenda] using the> Internet against the US [Illuminati]. > “The US should consider the use of biological weapons and that “new” methods> of attack – electronic, ‘non-lethal’, biological – will be more widely> available … combat likely will take place in new dimensions, in space,> cyberspace, and perhaps the world of microbes … advanced forms of biological> warfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes may transform biological warfare> from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.” 33 Once again, note the language: “specific genotypes” – the biological targetingof particular races. Who said Hitler was dead? A major target for Illuminatigenocide are the black peoples, especially of Africa, and that is why themanufactured ‘Aids’ plague has been visited on that continent. I found it so sadthat Live Aid’s Bob Geldof could be so naïve as to praise President Bush forhelping Africa when the forces working through Bush are determined to destroyits people. The strings-attached money Bush pledged to “fight Aids” in Africa isa round of drinks compared with the wealth stolen and extorted from thatcontinent by the ‘West’ every year. The sick minds behind this biologicalwarfare targeting “specific genotypes” are the same people who had the nerve tosay that Iraq must be invaded because it had biological weapons or, as theirNewspeak mantra puts it: “Weapons of mass destruction.” The veteran LabourMember of Parliament, Tam Dalyell, said of the PNAC report:> “This is a blueprint for US world domination – a new world order of their> making. These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to> control the world. I am appalled that a British Labour Prime Minister should> have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.” 34 But they are not fantasist Americans as such. They are fantasist initiates andpawns of the Illuminati that have placed their operatives in positions of powerwithin the US government. Their focus is not with being American or what is bestfor Americans, but with using that nation to progress the Illuminati agenda forthe global fascist state. The reason that Tony Blair is so slavishly supportingthe ‘US’ no matter what happens is because he is also an Illuminati placeman whois there to serve his hidden masters, just like Bush. Do as you are told, guys,and you’ll be fine. Fail to deliver and “Houston, we have a problem”. They arefar more terrified of those who control them than they are of the consequencesin public popularity. The Bush group’s blueprint for global dominationsummarised above is clearly unfolding by the month with the Iraq phase underwayand Syria, Iran and North Korea already being targeted by the spinners whodemonise countries as a prelude to invasion. The resistance they are facing inIraq, however, is making their plans far more difficult and the lack of ‘weaponsof mass destruction’ has produced an increasingly sceptical public. Blair’scredibility is in tatters. It’s not as straightforward as they thought it wasgoing to be. People may find the mention of China as a target to be a staggeringsuggestion, but, as I have mentioned in my books, talks and interviews foryears, many different contacts have told me that it was all leading to amanipulated conflict with China. In my book, The Biggest Secret, published twoyears before the Project for the New American Century document, I wrote:> “... The plan is to engineer events, real and staged, that will create> enormous fear in the countdown years to 2012. This includes a plan to start a> third world war either by stimulating the Muslim world into a ‘holy war’> against the West or by using the Chinese to cause global conflict. Maybe> both.” 35 A CIA scientist I met in 1997 was only one of many people who have told me thata conflict with China is where the agenda is leading. They want a global war forthe same reason they wanted the two in the 20th century. A global problem opensthe way to a global solution – the creation of a world government and army to“prevent another war”. With the world economy in a catastrophic state after sucha conflict the way would be open for a world central bank and currency to“rebuild the financial system”. And, of course, we would need to microchip thepeople to protect them from the baddies.Who benefits from 9/11?Now what was the trigger for the ‘war on terrorism’? What has been thefoundation of the cover story for global conquest by what is nothing less thanthe Fourth Reich? Why, of course, it is the attacks of September 11th, whichPresident Bush called “Our Pearl Harbor”. Well, well, well. The Project for theNew American Century (PNAC) document, produced a year before 9/11, says thattheir blueprint for conquest or their “process of transformation” was likely tobe long and slow “absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a newPearl Harbor”. And what happened at just the right moment to advance their plansdramatically? 9/11. The American Free Press asked Christopher Maletz, assistantdirector of the PNAC, what was meant by the need for “a new Pearl Harbor”. Hesaid they needed more money to increase the defence budget for new arms andfuture capabilities. “Without some disaster or catastrophic event thepoliticians and the military would have not have approved this”, Maletz said.36Thanks to 9/11, Congress allocated $40 billion to fund the ‘war on terrorism’and the 2002 military budget alone was $345.7 billion with further massive risesto come. This is exactly what the PNAC document called for and because of 9/11it is happening. Coincidence? Can a whale fit in a matchbox?In truth, this is not an ‘American’ agenda for global conquest, that’s just thecover to hide the fact that what we are seeing happen is the Illuminati agendathat I, and many others, have been exposing all these years. The United Statesis just their vehicle, that’s all. They couldn’t care less about those who callthemselves American any more than they could those in any other country. Neitheris the Project for the New American Century report just the work of a few loonyright-wing fanatics, as is claimed. It is a summary of part of the Illuminatiagenda as it is planned to proceed over the next few years. Look at thepersonnel of the PNAC and the network of connecting organisations. They havebecome known as neo-conservatives or ‘neo-cons’:Donald Rumsfeld (PNAC founding member): Defense Secretary in the ‘war onterrorism’, who is ensuring that the blueprint produced by his own organisationcomes to pass. Rumsfeld visited Baghdad in 1983 to arrange for the shipment ofchemical and biological weapons to Saddam Hussein from the Reagan-Bushadministration and in 2000 he was on the board of the European engineeringcompany, ABB, when it supplied nuclear technology to North Korea. This is yetanother example of the secret agenda and the movie running alongside each other.Rumsfeld was involved in supplying the ‘problems’ that the movie could laterclaim made action necessary against Iraq and North Korea.Paul Wolfowitz (PNAC founding member): Deputy Defense Secretary, whom Bush calls“Wolfie”. He is a far right supporter of the Jewish Institute for NationalSecurity Affairs (JINSA) – a “think-tank that puts Israel and its security atthe heart of US foreign policy”.37 Wolfowitz, who has relatives in Israel, hasalso served as the Bush administration’s liaison to the American Israel PublicAffairs Committee and has extremely close ties to the government of Israel. Thisis just the background you need to be seen as impartial on Middle East policy.Wolfowitz is the real power at the Pentagon, more so than Rumsfeld. Rarely isthe person officially in charge the one who is really in control.Dick Cheney (PNAC founding member): Vice President and on the board of advisorsof the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA). He was DefenseSecretary to father George Bush during the 1991 Gulf War and he’s the real powerin the White House behind the village idiot. Cheney was head of the oil servicesgiant, Halliburton, from 1995 to 2000 when the company enjoyed contracts withSaddam Hussein’s Iraq and worked with other terrorist dictatorships to linetheir pockets. Cheney is a very disturbed entity indeed (see my other books).Lewis Libby (PNAC founding member): Chief of Staff to Cheney, close friend,confidant and protégé of Wolfowitz. He served in father George Bush’s DefenseDepartment and is closely connected with the Illuminati Rand Corporation, oilcompanies, and the defence contractor, Northrop Grumman, which, like the RandCorporation, enjoys massive contracts with the Pentagon. Libby was a lawyer forconvicted felon and Israeli spy Mark Rich, who was pardoned by Illuminati frontman and crook, Bill Clinton, in his last days as president.James Woolsey: another JINSA member and former director of the CIA from 1993-95.Woolsey, a member of the US Policy Defense Board at the Pentagon, said hebelieves the United States is going to be involved for several decades inhelping to “change the face” of the Middle East.38 He also said: “We will make alot of people very nervous and we will hear, for example, the Mubarak regime inEgypt or the Saudi royal family thinking about the idea of these Americansspreading of democracy in this part of the world. They will say you make us verynervous. Our response should be … good.” 39 Woolsey studied at Oxford Universitybetween 1963 and 1965 when he was awarded an Illuminati Rhodes Scholarship (justlike Bill Clinton). See And The Truth Shall Set You Free for more on the RhodesScholar network.John Bolton: served with the State Department, Justice Department and thegovernment’s international ‘aid’ agency, USAID, under father George Bush. He isnow under-secretary for arms control and international security in the StateDepartment. Bolton is a major player in the policy on Iraq and was also one ofBush’s chad-counters during the rigged election in Florida. He is a member ofthe Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) and is avice-president at the far-right American Enterprise Institute as well as beinginvolved with the Project for the New American Century. Bolton is reported tothink the ‘war on terrorism’ is World War Four and could take 40 years tofinish.Jeb Bush: brother of the brain cell and Governor of Florida during the electionfraud that stopped Al Gore becoming president. The Bush family is corrupt to itscore and fundamentally connected into the Illuminati web as my other books haveextensively detailed.Zalmay Khalilzad: the Afghanistan-born American who was made special envoy toAfghanistan before the war that installed his fellow Unocal employee, HamidKarsai, as leader. Khalilzad authored a book on Saddam with Wolfowitz calledOverthrow Him and encouraged his close friend, George ‘Illuminati’ Shultz, theformer Reagan-Bush Secretary of State, to use Iran to bring down Saddam. LikeLewis Libby, he has worked for the Illuminati Rand Corporation and he alsoserved under National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, when she was adirector of Chevron, a company that stands to benefit enormously from theconquest of Iraq and the pipelines across Afghanistan. Khalilzad has closeconnections to both events. Once his job was done in Afghanistan, Khalilzad wasappointed Bush’s ‘special envoy’ to Iraq to play a similar role by installing aUS puppet-government. He was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, an‘intellectual’ centre for the American right wing. He became a special advisorto the State Department under Reagan-Bush when he was very much involved in thearming of the Mujahadeen fighting the Russian occupation and this included Osamabin Laden and what became al-Qaeda. He later became undersecretary of defense tofather George Bush and headed the transition team for the Defense Department,advising Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after boy Bush was manipulated intopower. He was then appointed to the National Security Council and reports to hisold friend at Chevron, Condoleezza Rice.40Elliott Abrams: pleaded guilty on two counts of lying to Congress about theIran- Contra arms-for-drugs scandal, but was pardoned by father George Bush.Abrams tried to cover up the murder of hundreds of civilians at El Mozote by anelite US- trained military unit in El Salvador. In 1993 a UN truth commission,which investigated 22,000 atrocities during the twelve-year El Salvador civilwar, found that 85% of the abuses were the work of theReagan-Bush-Abrams-supported right-wing military. Condoleezza Rice appointedAbrams, as, get this, Senior Director for Democracy, Human Rights, andInternational Operations at the National Security Council in 2001. A year latershe made him Senior Director for Near East and North African Affairs, includingArab-Israel relations and American efforts to promote “peace and security” inthe region. Abrams is on the advisory board of the Media Research Center, anorganization that opposes liberalism on television or in films.John Negroponte: the Bush ambassador to the United Nations with a horrifichistory. He was a major aide to the US embassy in Vietnam from 1964, an advisorto the war criminal Henry Kissinger, and in charge of Vietnam policy on the USNational Security Council. In the 1980s he carried out the covert policy ofReagan- Bush to destroy the elected Sandinista government in Nicaragua and inHonduras he administered a massive increase in US military support for theright-wing government. It soared from $4m to $77m and the country became knownas USS Honduras. Negroponte was also fundamentally involved with the infamousBattalion 3-16 in Honduras that ran a terror campaign of murder and tortureagainst the people.Richard Perle (PNAC founding member): former Assistant Defense Secretary toReagan-Bush, a leading member of the Jewish Institute for National SecurityAffairs (JINSA) and the chairman of the far-right American Enterprise Institute(AEI) on 17th Street in Washington, which has Cheney’s wife, Lynne, among itsmembership. Fourteen members of this AEI organisation are in the Bush cabinetand others are elsewhere in the administration. Bush told an AEI conference onFebruary 26th, 2003: “At the American Enterprise Institute some of the finestminds in our nation are at work in some of the greatest challenges to ournation. You do such good work that my administration has borrowed 20 suchminds.” 41 Perle has so many of his associates in the Bush government that theyare known as the “string of Perles”.42 At the Pentagon, Perle was nicknamed the“Prince of Darkness” for his hard-line beliefs and he introduced a number ofstaunchly pro-Israel activists who dramatically increased weapons sales toIsrael. He is a former employee of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, Soltam.Perle is a member of several other right-wing groups like the Foundation for theDefense of Democracies (along with James Woolsey, the former CIA chief andmember of the Project for the New American Century), and he is referred to asthe “neo-cons political godfather”.43Perle is a former aide to one-time Israeli premier, Benjamin Netanyahu, and in1996 he simultaneously advised both the Bob Dole campaign in the United Statesand the Netanyahu campaign in Israel. Perle was also advisor to the lobbyingfirm run by Douglas J. Feith, the Pentagon’s under-secretary of defense. Beforethe invasion of Iraq, Perle advised clients of the investment house, GoldmanSachs, about investment opportunities in Iraq when the US was in control. He isa director of the software company, Autonomy Corp, which includes the Pentagonamong its clients. Autonomy says it expected its profits to increasedramatically after the war. Perle is a member of the Defense Policy Board thatadvises the Pentagon. Another member is Henry Kissinger, a major Illuminatioperative of the last 40 years. Perle had to resign as chairman of the Boardwhen conflicts of interest were exposed. My god, how many? He resigned after itwas reported he had worked as a consultant to the bankrupt telecommunicationscompany, Global Crossing Ltd., which was trying to get Pentagon approval to besold to Asian investors. The Los Angeles Times revealed that Perle briefed aninvestment seminar on ways to profit from the conflict in Iraq and North Koreajust weeks after he received a top-secret government briefing on the twocountries.44 The Defense Intelligence Agency briefing that Perle attended tookplace in February 2003, the Times reported, and he held his seminar three weekslater. The Times further cited agendas of the meetings and other documents toshow that Perle and fellow advisers received a classified address about militarycommunications systems. Perle runs Trireme Partners, a venture capital firm thathas been exploring such high-tech investments.45 “The guiding principle here isthat you do not give advice in the Defense Policy Board on any particular matterin which you have an interest”, Perle said. “And I don’t do that. I haven’t donethat.” 46 I think old Rich has another guiding principle, myself, althoughprinciple is not the word that comes immediately to mind. Perle told the BBC:“The President of the United States on issue after issue has reflected the viewsof neo-conservatives. I think he comes to his view in his own way and throughhis own experience, but it happens to track very closely with the outlook ofneo-conservatives, especially since 9/11.” 47 Firstly, Bush doesn’t have anyexperience, nor a mind that could assimilate it; and second, the ‘neo-cons’manipulated Bush into the presidency to front their agenda and he does whateverthey tell him.Michael Ledeen: Wow. Another member of the American Enterprise Institute andinvolved in the 1970s in the “shadowy world of right-wing Italian politics”.48Ledeen has close ties to Henry Kissinger, the Illuminati ‘Roman Catholic’ front,Opus Dei, and the Italian P-2 Masonic Lodge involving his associate, LicioGelli, a far, far, right Illuminati operator (see And The Truth Shall Set YouFree).49 As I mentioned earlier, Gelli, a Mussolini fascist and Knight of Malta,was the Grand Master of P-2. It was involved in the murder of the Italianpolitician, Aldo Moro, and other terrorist outrages by the so-called RedBrigade. P-2 and Gelli were behind the Vatican banking scandal featuring “God’sBanker” Roberto Calvi who was silenced by being ritually murdered underBlackfriars Bridge at the entrance to the City of London (And the Truth ShallSet You Free has the background). Francesco Pazienza, who is also reported to beclose to Michael Ledeen,50 was suspected of setting up Calvi for murder and atthe time of his death Calvi’s family said he was killed by Opus Dei. Gelli andPazienza, both associates of Ledeen, were jailed for their crimes, but notbefore Gelli was invited to the inauguration ceremony for President RonaldReagan, the puppet for father George Bush, in 1981. Gelli and P-2 were closelyconnected with the Priory of Sion, the secret society going back with theKnights Templar to the 12th century and dedicated to the advancement of theMerovingian (big-time Illuminati) bloodline (see The Biggest Secret). When theItalian authorities raided Gelli’s Roman villa in 1981, they found files listingmembers of affiliated secret societies that formed a “cabal within a cabal”.These included Opus Dei with its thousands of initiates worldwide and themembership lists of the Knights Templar. Among the P-2 members was the laterPrime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi. Surprised? No, nor me. This is thereal background to those now controlling the American and British governments inthe ‘war on terrorism’.Michael Ledeen also had secret meetings with the Israeli government in the 1980sthat led, “inadvertently” he says, to the Iran-Contra guns for drugs affaircoordinated through the Reagan-Bush White House.51 Now, since 9/11, as the BBCreported, Ledeen’s “shadowy neo-con talents are back in favour”.52 In 2001,Ledeen was co-chair of the US – China Economic and Security Review Commission.This is significant given the neo-Nazi plan for a conflict with China. Ledeensays: “All the great scholars who have studied the American character have cometo the conclusion that we are a war-like people. We love war.” 53 He talks ofthe need to “free” Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Libya and North Korea after theinvasion of Iraq. “No-one would have imagined that the United States could, andmaybe should, consider France and Germany as strategic enemies”, he said, “andyet they have behaved now for several months as if they are strategic enemies.”54 Ledeen, who has a model of Darth Vader on his desk, naturally says he is astudent of the arch manipulator Machiavelli and his attitude was encapsulated bythis remark: “Richard [Perle] says he doesn’t think Americans are vindictive.Well I hope he’s wrong.” 55 Jim Lobe of the Inter Press Service in Washingtonhas been compiling files on the ‘neo-cons’ since the 1970s when he realised howinfluential they could be. He says of Michael Ledeen:> “People were very surprised to see that of the [very few] people who Karl> Rove, Bush’s closest advisor, … talks to … that are knowledgeable in foreign> affairs … one of them is Michael Ledeen and that will be a cause for sleepless> nights for many people I would think. He is a provocateur and he’s written> more than once that the thing he really dislikes about the foreign policy> establishment is that it thinks in terms of stability rather than revolution> and radical change.” 56 As Ledeen told the UK Daily Telegraph: “Undermining the governments of othercountries? No big deal.” 57Douglas J. Feith: under-secretary for policy at the Pentagon, who selects themembers of the Defense Policy Board. He is on the board of advisers of theJewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) and was a lawyer todefense contractors, Northrop Grumman. Feith was given an award by the ZionistOrganisation of America, citing him as a “pro-Israel activist”.58 He is arepresentative of “Israeli armaments manufacturer” Dov Zakheim, who has arrangedfor the US to supply Israel with state-of-the-art weapons.59 I saw Feithinterviewed on British television as I was completing this book and it seemed tome that he had undergone a charisma by-pass.Michael Joyce: the former president of the massively influential BradleyFoundation that created The Project for a New American Century. It has alsoprovided millions in funding for the PNAC, the American Enterprise Institute anda long list of other neo-con organisations and authors. One such writer claimedthat poverty was due to the genetic traits of a sub class of human beings –classic Illuminati racism. Joyce is a close associate of the paedophile WilliamBennett, the Education Secretary to Ronald Reagan, and the paedophile fatherGeorge Bush. Bennett was rumoured to be involved in the education system in Iraqafter the war. God help the kids, then. Joyce claims to be a “moral guardian” ofAmerican family values and he is an advisor to Americans for Victory overTerrorism, a group that wants to prevent criticism of American military policy.A fellow advisor is James Woolsey, the former head of the CIA.Meyrav Wurmser: a neo-Conservative “writer” with the Illuminati HudsonInstitute, who monitors the Arab Press for “anti-Semitic” remarks. Her husband,David, is an advisor at the State Department and both are with the farright-wing, give-war-a-chance, American Enterprise Institute.Joshua Muravchik: a member of the American Enterprise Institute who has noproblem with a devastating war on the Korean peninsular, so long as, like therest of these sad people, they don’t have to take part themselves. Muravchiktold the BBC that removing the “nuclear threat” of North Korea “… might includehaving to try to destroy it by military strikes”.60 He said such a war would be“far worse than in Iraq, it’d be a war in which thousands and thousands ofKoreans would die and maybe thousands of Americans as well”. But who gives ashit, Josh; you won’t be there will you?David Frum: wrote Bush’s “axis of evil” speech that targeted Iraq, Iran andNorth Korea. He is a ‘scholar’ at the American Enterprise Institute. Frum was aBush speech-writer for two years from 2001. He wrote a sycophantic book aboutBush called The Right Man that was hailed on all the television networks as“controversial”. He would then appear and tell the viewers what a wonderfulpresident Bush was. Frum said on the eve of the Iraqi slaughter: “I pray … forthe success of American arms.” 61 Oh, I’m sure the gods will oblige.William Kristol: former chief of staff to Dan Quayle, the vice president tofather Bush, and was known as “Quayle’s brain”. Not much to do there, then. Heorganised the formation of the Project for the New American Century, of which heis chairman, on behalf of the Bradley Foundation. With this background, nowonder he is a political ‘pundit’ on Murdoch’s Fox/Fix News. He is chairman ofthe New Citizenship Project that connects with the Project for the New AmericanCentury. It claims to be a non-profit, “educational” organization promotingAmerican global leadership. Kristol told the BBC: “American power should notjust be used in defence of American interests, but for the promotion of Americanprinciples … we are going to have to bring down a series of regimes who aresponsors of a network of various terrorist organisations.” 62 He names them asIran, Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and North Korea. But was this not atyranny to expand the control of America? “No”, said Kristol, “It is aboutfreedom and democracy, not about capitalism.” “No”, said Icke, it is aboutglobal conquest for the Hidden Hand. Kristol, like Perle, says that theirideological poodle in London, Tony Blair, is a “kind of neo-conservative”.63Kind of?? Kristol said the mass killing in Iraq was “the end of the beginning ofthis part of the war, it is not the end of the end”.64 They would give Iraq anew government “and then really work to remove other dictators with weapons ofmass destruction”.65The neo-cons – neo-Nazis – say that democracies (tyrannies in which you can casta meaningless vote) don’t harbour international terrorists. But what about theWhite House and Downing Street for a start? Kristol runs the RupertMurdoch-financed Weekly Standard in Washington, five floors below the AmericanEnterprise Institute. The publication slavishly supports the Bush and Israelline. A regular contributor to the paper is John Bolton, the Iraq warmanipulator, who loves to attack UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Others includePerle, Wolfowitz, Feith and Woolsey. In 1998, it was Kristol, Bolton, Rumsfeld,Wolfowitz, Khalilzad, Bennett, Woolsey, Perle and later Deputy Secretary ofState, Richard Armitage, who signed a letter calling on President Bill Clintonto instigate military action in Iraq.66 What a bunch these are and they arerunning our world on behalf of forces we never see. Kristol is very close toVice President Cheney and is at the heart of the agenda with regard to the Bushgovernment. In that case it doesn’t look good either for Saudi Arabia or Egypt.Reporting an interview with Kristol, the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, said:> “… his opinion is that it is impossible to let Saudi Arabia just continue what> it is doing. It is impossible to accept the anti-Americanism it is> disseminating. The fanatic Wahhabism that Saudi Arabia engenders is> undermining the stability of the entire region. It’s the same with Egypt, he> says: we mustn’t accept the status quo there. For Egypt, too, the horizon has> to be liberal democracy.” 67 Richard Perle, one of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld’s closest advisers and a vocaladvocate of war against Iraq, has also publicly questioned the “reliability” (weintend to invade) of long-time US ally, Saudi Arabia.68 As I said in Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster, Saudi Arabia has long been apuppet state of the US, but I felt there were plans to move in eventually andtake complete control, as with Iraq. While I was writing this chapter, theUnited States announced it was withdrawing most of its troops from Saudi Arabia.You can bet this is part of a strategy that will include the demonisation ofSaudi Arabia and the return of the troops to take over the country and its oil.As per usual, terrorist bombs exploded in Saudi Arabia killing many people justbefore Colin Powell was due to arrive, providing the backdrop of devastationthat he could exploit with his ‘war on terror’ propaganda. In the predictablestyle of manipulators, William Kristol seeks to present everything as black andwhite. You are either with us or for the terrorists, and so on. He told Haaretzthat the choice was between “extremist Islam, secular fascism or democracy”, andbecause of September 11th, he said, “Americans understood that”. No, America hasbeen told that over and over by people like Kristol since those planes struckthe twin towers. “America is in a position where it has no choice”, Kristolludicrously said. “It is obliged to be far more aggressive in promotingdemocracy, hence this war.” For “democracy” read “American control”. He claimedthat this policy was based on the new American understanding that if the UnitedStates does not shape the world in its image, the world will shape the UnitedStates in its own image. Once again we see that the whole foundation for thejustification of this fascist expansionism of the Fourth Reich is believing theofficial story of the attacks that happened on September 11th to be true. But itis not; the official story is a lie. Who told us what happened, who did it, howthey did it, and why? The same forces that are using their false version of thestory to follow their long-planned agenda for global conquest. CharlesKrauthammer, a columnist for the Washington Post, Time, and Kristol’s WeeklyStandard, is close to the Project for the New American Century and he took thesame line in his interview with Haaretz:> “… the sea-change … took place here on September 11, 2001. Since that morning,> Americans have understood that if they don’t act now and if weapons of mass> destruction reach extremist terrorist organizations, millions of Americans> will die. Therefore, because they understand that those others want to kill> them by the millions, the Americans prefer to take to the field of battle and> fight, rather than sit idly by and die at home.” 69 The familiar technique of frightening the people into acquiescence is all basedon the acceptance that the official story of 9/11 is what really happened. Thesituation is presented as open and shut, black and white, no middle ground, noroom for debate. As always, there is the “Americans have understood”, “Americansknow”, when the truth is that is simply what people like Krauthammer, Kristol,Murdoch, Perle, Rumsfeld, Powell, Cheney and Bush have told them. The New YorkTimes columnist, Thomas Friedman, said:> “Is the Iraq war the great neoconservative war? It’s the war the> neoconservatives wanted. It’s the war the neoconservatives marketed. Those> people had an idea to sell when September 11th came, and they sold it. Oh boy,> did they sell it. So this is not a war that the masses demanded. This is a war> of an elite. I could give you the names of 25 people (all of whom are at this> moment within a five-block radius of this office) who, if you had exiled them> to a desert island a year and a half ago, the Iraq war would not have> happened.” 70 Khalid Saffuri of the Islamic Institute said of the neo-con cabal: “They are adisaster for this country and many members of Congress believe that, but theydon’t dare say it. They’ll take on everyone, it’s like a gang, you know, it’slike a Mafia.” 71 Syria’s deputy US ambassador, Imad Moustapha said: “Sometimesthey are really terrifying in the way they think, the way they would like toshape the world, the way they think they can impose their doctrine on everyoneelse, even if force is needed.” 72 Moustapha said he was not worried about themimplementing their policies because of Syria’s friends and allies. Oh, Imad.Look again, mate. A former US ambassador and White House aide said: “This bunchof interlopers who’ve latched on to George are stark, staring bonkers. Theirpolicies are insane.” 73 And Arthur Schlesinger, the historian and formerspecial assistant to President Kennedy, also referred to them as “lunatics”:“They lack any decent respect for the opinions of the rest of mankind; and castthemselves as the world’s jury, judge and executioner in deciding which countryto attack, which people to bomb.” 74Yes, and it is their basic inhumanity that makes what they do emotionallypossible.SOURCES > 1“USA: Unocal Advisor Named Representative to Afghanistan”, World Socialist> Web Site, January 3rd 2002> 2Ted Rall, author of To Afghanistan and Back, recounting his experiences> covering the Afghan war. http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=12205> [http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=12205]> 3“Berating the Generals, The Siege of Washington”, by Wayne Madsen, a> Washington, DC-based investigative journalist, CounterPunch, March 31st 2003,> http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen03312003.html> [http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen03312003.html]> 4“The Next World Order, The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine> of power”, New Yorker, April 1st 2002> 5http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf> [http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf]> 6“Bush planned Iraq ‘regime change’ before becoming President”, by Neil> Mackay, Sunday Herald, http://www.Sundayherald.com/27735> [http://www.Sundayherald.com/27735]> 7Ibid> 8“I asked my intelligence source why Blair misled us all over Saddam’s WMD.> His response?

The document advised theright-wing Netanyahu to adopt a new strategy “based on an entirely newintellectual foundation, one that restores strategic initiative and provides thenation the room to engage every possible energy on rebuilding Zionism”.2 Itcalled for Israel to abandon any policy of trading land for peace with the Arabsbecause this, it said, was “cultural, economic, political, diplomatic andmilitary retreat”. The Clean Break was a virtual replica of the blueprintproduced four years later for the incoming Bush administration by the Projectfor the New American Century. This is no surprise when you realise that theauthors of the two documents were pretty much the same and they are now at theheart of the Bush government. I will look further at the Clean Break documentand its authors shortly, but first there are some extremely important points tomake about the re-writing of history with relation to Israel and otherinformation the neo-con manipulators wish to suppress. For example, the CleanBreak paper makes this assertion:> “Our claim to the land – to which we have clung for hope for 2,000 years – is> legitimate and noble. Only the unconditional acceptance by Arabs of our> rights, especially in their territorial dimension, ‘peace for peace’, is a> solid basis for the future.” 3 It turns out, however, to be anything but legitimate and noble. The Zionistclaim to the land of Israel is based on Old Testament texts, the true authorshipof which is unknown. Put simply: “God gave the ‘Promised Land’ to us, his‘chosen people’, and so the land is ours.” Er, that’s it. But it gets even moreinsane. As some brave Jewish writers like Arthur Koestler4 have confirmed, theoverwhelming majority of ‘Jewish’ people have no historical connection at all tothe land of Israel. They are not genetically Jewish and they are certainly not‘Semites’!! They don’t originate from Biblical Israel, but from a people calledthe Khazars in what became southern Russia down to the Caucasus Mountains. Thisis why the so-called ‘Jewish nose’ is not a genetic trait of Israel, but theCaucasus. Alfred M. Lilienthal, a former American State Department official,called these facts “Israel’s Achilles heel”, because it destroys Zionist claimsto the land of the Biblical Hebrews.5 Historians believe the Khazars to bedescendents of the Turkik tribe known as the Huns or Hun that invaded andsavaged Europe from Asia around 450 AD. The Huns’ territories stretched at onetime from Central Asia to Central Europe, from Siberia and China to North India.They were a grouping of tribes and bloodlines from the interbreeding with manypeoples, including the Chinese and the Sumerians. The Huns are best rememberedfor their leader, Attila the Hun, who seized power by killing his brother, Buda,after whom the Hungarian city of Budapest was named. Like the Huns, the Khazarsspoke the Turkik language and are believed to be the same people. The Khazarscontrolled a large and powerful ‘Pagan’ empire across most of Russia to the UralMountains in the East and the Caucasus Mountains in the south and they madetheir living as traders and ‘middlemen’, levying taxes on the goods carried onthe trade routes through their lands. Their influence in Eastern Europe extendedwell into the countries we now know as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary,Romania and Bulgaria (Figure 7, overleaf). The Khazars were phallic worshippersand engaged in human sacrifice rituals. In a series of wars, the first from 642to 652 AD, and the second from 722 to 739 AD, some 300,000 Khazar warriorsprevailed against invading Muslims. They saved Russia and Eastern Europe forChristianity, which had also been defended on other fronts by the armies ofCharles Martel (“the Hammer”), the leader of the Merovingian Franks. Martel wasthe grandfather of Charlemagne, to whom 34 of the 43 presidents of the UnitedStates are descended, together with the royal families of Europe.The “circumsised unicorn”In about 740 AD, King Bulan, the King of Khazaria, adopted the religion ofJudaism and the whole nation did the same. Legend says that King Bulan was toldto do this in dreams or visions, but it was clearly a political move to avoidbeing absorbed by the Christian or Islamic world on either side. What is forcertain is that the Khazars, the ancestors of at least 90 per cent of thosecalling themselves ‘Jewish’ today, had nothing whatsoever to do with the landcalled Israel. Their home was not the Dead Sea, but the Caspian Sea, whichbecame known as the ‘Khazar Sea’. This is the area targeted by the Illuminatitoday for its immense oil and gas reserves. Arthur Koestler writes that a“warrior nation of Turkish Jews must have seemed to the rabbis as strange as acircumcised unicorn”.6 There were, apparently, two streams of Khazar known asthe Kara or “black” Khazars and the Ak or “white” Khazars, although ArthurKoestler says this may not have been related to the colour of their skin. But anArab Chronicler, Ibn-Said al-Maghribi, wrote:> “As to the Khazars, they are to the north of the inhabited Earth towards the> 7th clime, having over their heads the constellation of the Plough. Their land> is cold and wet. Accordingly their complexions are white, their eyes blue,> their hair flowing and predominantly reddish, their bodies large and their> natures cold. Their general aspect is wild.” 7 Img [../Images/00012.jpg]Figure 7: The Empire of the Khazars with the Christian and Muslim worlds oneither side. The Khazars converted to Judaism in about 740 AD and these are theorigins of people like the Rothschilds, Henry Kissinger, the ‘neo-con’leadership in the United States and those who have controlled Israel since itwas formed in 1948. They are not Semitic people and do not have any connectionto the land of Israel. Certainly the Caucasus region is so associated with the white race that in NorthAmerica white people are still referred to as “Caucasian”. The Khazars fought,made alliances and interbred with peoples like the Viking Rus (who became theRussians) and the Magyars with whom they had extremely close relations. TheKhazars were instrumental in the creation of the Magyar homeland of Hungary.Names like the Russian Cossack and the Hungarian Hussar came from ‘Khazar’, asdid the German for heretic, Ketzer.8 The Khazars also had close connections withthe Byzantine Christian/Roman Empire and there was interbreeding between them. AKhazar princess married Emperor Constantine V and their son became Emperor LeoIV, known as Leo the Khazar, who ruled Byzantium from 775 to 800. The deposedEmperor Justinian II fled to Khazaria in 705, where the king (the “Khagan” or“Kagan”) gave him shelter and allowed him to marry his sister. She took the nameTheodora and became Empress when Justinian was restored to the Byzantine throne.The Khazar SumeriansThe Khazars and their close associates and subordinates, the Magyars, wererelated to the Sumerians, a people that will become increasingly important inthis story as we progress. The Sumerians were said to be the first settlers ofsouthern Mesopotamia about 5,000 BC and came from the mountainous regions to thenorth and east. There they built what historians call “the cradle ofcivilisation” and an empire that stretched in all directions, including north ofthe Caucasus Mountains where the Khazars were to develop their own empire andhave their mass ‘conversion’ to the Jewish faith. It was believed that theMagyars were a nomadic people from the north with a language of Finnish-Ugrianorigin. But Dr Sandor Nagy writes in The Forgotten Cradle of the HungarianCulture,9 that the people who later became known as Magyars were Sumerians thatwere pushed out of the Fertile Crescent of what is now Iraq. Dr Nagy usesextensive examples to confirm the linguistic similarities between the Sumerian,Old Magyar and the current Magyar language. He also refers to several workswritten during the first millennium, including the Arpad Codices and the DeAdministrando Imperio, and completed 50 years of his own research. He says thatthat while there are only two hundred Magyar words related to the Finno-Ugriclanguage, there are over two thousand words related to the Sumerian. British,French and German archaeologists and linguists concluded that the language ofancient Sumerian inscriptions was not Indo-European nor Semitic, but a languagewhich demonstrated significant similarities with the group of languages known atthe time as the Turanian ethno-linguistic group that included Hungarian, Turkic,Mongolian and Finnic (later referred to as the Ural-Altaic group).10 Researchhas indicated that the Sumerian- Hungarian languages have over a thousand commonword roots and a very similar grammatical structure. Kálmán Gosztony, professorof Sumerian philology at the Sorbonne, demonstrated in Sumerian EtymologicalDictionary and Comparative Grammar that the structure of the Hungarian languageis the closest to that of the Sumerian. Of the 53 characteristics of Sumeriangrammar, 51 matched in the Hungarian, compared with 29 in the Turkic languages,24 in the Caucasian, 21 in the Uralic languages, 5 in the Semitic languages and4 in the Indo-European. The linguistic similarities between Sumerian, Hungarianand other languages are confirmed by the archaeological and anthropologicalevidence.Dr Sandor Nagy says there were two separate migrations of the Sumerian peopleout of Mesopotamia – one through Turkey to the Carpathian Basin and the otherwent east and then north across the Caucasus Mountains into the area between theCaspian and Black Seas. This was the land occupied by the Khazar Empire to suchan extent that the Caspian became known as the Khazar Sea. The Khazars weredescended from the Huns and the Huns are said to be descended, like the Magyars,from the Sumerians. An ancient pre-Christian traditional account of Hungarianorigins says they are the descendents of Nimrod (the legendary founder ofBabylon), the son of Cush. The legend claims that Nimrod and Eneth had two sons,Magor and Hunor. It is said that Magor was the ancestor of the Magyars and Hunorwas the ancestor of the Huns, so providing the common origin of the Magyars andthe Huns (Khazars). Ancient Byzantine sources say the Magyars were also calledthe Sabirs and originated from Mesopotamia, the land of Sumer. Numerous otherancient and medieval sources refer to the Scythians, Huns (Khazars), Avars andMagyars as the same peoples, even though the Hungarian authorities appeardesperate to deny this. In previous books I have highlighted the movement of theformer Sumerians through the Caucasus Mountains under different names, like theScythians. Now we have further confirmation of the importance of the Caucasusregion where, as again I have emphasised before, some highly significantinterbreeding occurred between bloodlines from Sumer and those from the Far Eastand China. This Caucasian- Chinese-Turkish combination produced very importantbloodlines from the Illuminati’s point of view. A writer on a Jewish website,using the name Im nin’alu, says:> “The Huns’ origin is directly connected with two well-known peoples of the> ancient Middle East: the Sumerians and the Scythians, namely, in the kingdom> founded by Nimrod. Even though they belong to the Japhetic stock and their> most creditable ancestor is Magog, the Sumerian heritage has been kept by them> more than by any other people, which implies that they are in fact the result> of a mixed background. According to their own legendary accounts (legends that> are anyway founded on true facts), it is very feasible that … they kept close> ties with Sumerians even for a long time after the Sumerians disappeared from> Mesopotamia as a national entity. Their particular link with ancient Sumerians> was found through the comparison of modern Hungarian (Magyar) and other> related languages with documents of the ancient Middle East that revealed a> possible common origin. > “The ancient Sumerians, that in the dawn of history settled in Southern> Mesopotamia, in the land commonly known as Shin’ar or Chaldea, arrived there> from the north, precisely from the Ararat region [now Turkey], that they> called ‘Subar-Ki’ or ‘Subar-Tu’. This area was also named after one of the> peoples that inhabited there, the Hurri, whose language was agglutinative like> Sumerian and had many words in common, even being a totally different tongue.> Modern Hungarian shares many terms with both Sumerian and Hurrian, as well as> with Elamite.” 11 The other exodusThe Khazar Empire, the first feudal state in Eastern Europe, broke up in aseries of wars and invasions culminating in the arrival of the Mongol ‘GoldenHorde’, best remembered for their inspiration, Genghis Khan. Over the centuriesof waning power and influence, the Khazar peoples began to emigrate in manydirections. S.W. Baron said of Khazaria in A Social and Religious History of theJews:> “Its population was largely absorbed by the Golden Horde which had established> the centre of its empire in Khazar territory. But before and after the Mongol> upheaval the Khazars sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands,> helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centres of Eastern Europe.” 12 Khazars took their Judaistic or Talmudic faith and settled in many East Europeanand Alpine lands, especially Poland-Lithuania. There are many ancient placenames in Poland and the Ukraine inspired by the name “Khazar” or “Zhid”, a termmeaning Jew.13 These include Kozarzewek, Kozara, Kozarzow and Zydowo. As theKhazar Empire collapsed in the period after 960, a number of Slavonic tribes,led by the Polans, formed an alliance that became the state called Poland.‘Jews’ (Khazars) played an important role in the Polish legends about theformation of the country. One says that a ‘Jew’ called Abraham Prokownik waselected by the tribes to rule them.14 Certainly Khazar ‘Jews’ became prominentin many countries of Eastern Europe. Arthur Koestler writes:> “Both the Hungarian and Polish sources refer to Jews employed as mintmasters,> administrators of the royal revenue, controllers of the salt monopoly,> tax-collectors and ‘money-lenders’ – i.e., bankers. This parallel suggests a> common origin of those two immigrant communities; and as we can trace the> origins of the bulk of Hungarian Jewry to the Magyar-Khazar nexus, the> conclusion seems self-evident.” 15 Koestler points out that the traditional garb of Polish Jewry is of unmistakablyEastern origin – “The skull-cap (yarmolka) is worn to this day by orthodox Jewsand by the Uzbeks and other Turkish people in the Soviet Union”. What happenedin this period is that the people formerly known for centuries as the Khazarsbecame known simply as ‘Jews’ and their true origin was lost. In its place theirleaders sold to them – and the rest of the world – a false history. This was thebelief that they were the Biblical Jews and the fallacy continues to this daywith devastating consequences for peace in the Middle East. The Khazar ‘Jews’were confined to ghettos as a result of Papal dictat in the mid-16th century andthis, together with the 17th century Cossack (ironically) massacres in theUkraine, led to another mass exodus into Hungary, Bohemia, Rumania and Germany.There were hardly any Jews in Germany until this time.16 “Thus the great trek tothe West was resumed”, says Koestler, “It was to continue through nearly threecenturies until the Second World War, and became the principle source of theexisting Jewish communities in Europe, the United States and Israel.” 17 So whatdoes all this mean for the official history of the Jewish people? Koestler, whowas himself born in Budapest, writes:> “… [It] would mean that their ancestors came not from the Jordan, but from the> Volga, not from Canaan but from the Caucasus, once believed to be the cradle> of the Aryan race; and that genetically they are more closely connected to the> Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.> Should this turn out to be the case, then the term ‘anti-Semitism’ would be> void of meaning, based on a misapprehension shared by both the killers and> their victims. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it slowly emerges from the> past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax which history has ever> perpetrated.” 18 Benjamin H. Freedman was a one-time Jewish businessman in New York and a longtime ‘insider’ before speaking out vociferously against Zionism after World WarTwo. He was personally acquainted with leading American political figures likeBernard Baruch, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy and John F.Kennedy. Freedman went much further in his assessment of the Khazar revelation:> “What are the facts about the Jews? (I call them Jews to you, because they are> known as Jews. I don’t call them Jews myself. I refer to them as so-called> Jews, because I know what they are.) … There wasn’t one of them [the Khazars]> who had an ancestor who ever put a toe in the Holy Land. Not only in Old> Testament history, but back to the beginning of time. Not one of them! And yet> they come to the Christians and ask us to support their armed insurrections in> Palestine by saying, ‘You want to help repatriate God’s Chosen People to their> Promised Land, their ancestral home, don’t you? It’s your Christian duty. We> gave you one of our boys as your Lord and Saviour … It is as ridiculous to> call them ‘people of the Holy Land,’ as it would be to call the 54 million> Chinese Moslems ‘Arabs’ …” 19 The former Khazar people are known as the Ashkenazi Jews (plural Ashkenazim) andsome writers estimate that perhaps 90% to 95% of those calling themselves‘Jewish’ worldwide are ancestors of the Khazars. Others are known as SephardicJews and they do have an historical connection to the Middle East, although eventhen the idea of a ‘chosen race’ going back to Biblical Israel still doesn’tstand up, as we shall see. The Ashkenazim (‘Khazars’) hold the reins of power inIsrael and have always done so since the country was created in 1948. The nameAshkenazi is said by some to originate from Ashkenaz, the Hebrew word forGermany. In fact, the Bible refers to the Ashkenaz as a people living in theregion of Mount Ararat (now Turkey) and Armenia. That would certainly fit thebasic location of the Khazars.20 There is also a Biblical reference to Ashkenaz,brother of Togarma and nephew of Magog.21 Joseph, the Khazar king in the secondhalf of the tenth century, wrote in correspondence that they were ancestors ofTogarma, who, he said, had ten sons that seeded all the Turkish tribes,including the Huns, Khazars and Bulgars. In the centuries after the demise ofKhazaria, the Ashkenazi as a people did not speak the Semitic language ofHebrew, which is no surprise at all because they are not Hebrews. They developedtheir own tongue called Yiddish. This began as a Germanic language from southeastern dialects of Middle High German and expanded into central and EasternEurope starting in the 12th century. Later it evolved to include elements ofHebrew, Aramaic, Slavic languages and other influences. Once again, Yiddish, thelanguage of the Ashkenazi, did not come from Israel, but from Germany andEastern Europe.22The multiple linguistic influences in their language were also mirrored in thegenes of the former Khazars. By this time they had interbred with so many otherraces that they were a genetic cocktail which included Sumerian, Turkish, FarEastern and northern and western European. But it could well be that among theirleaders, their perceived ‘royalty’, were elite bloodlines that did have ancestryin Egypt and the former Israel, as I explore in chapter nine[../Text/index_split_024.html#filepos903624]. These interbreeding ‘royal’bloodlines, hidden within the ‘Jewish’ masses they look upon with such contempt,could well include the Rothschilds. This dynasty was certainly the prime forcebehind the ‘Jewish’ takeover of ‘Israel’ in the 20th century and they behavelike a royal dictatorship.Heading “home”It was the Ashkenazi (Khazar) ‘Jews’ who were persecuted by theRothschild-controlled Nazis in Germany in the 20th century, a persecution thatled to the support for a ‘Jewish’ homeland in Israel. It was on the spurioushistorical claim that these people originated from Israel, and that ‘God’ hadpromised them the land, that the House of Rothschild orchestrated the takeoverof Palestine that has set the Middle East ablaze with violence ever since (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free for much more on the Rothschilds’ involvement).The Balfour Declaration in 1917, in which the British Foreign Secretary gave hisgovernment’s support for a ‘Jewish’ homeland in Palestine, took the form of aletter from Lord Balfour to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild. The letter was infact drafted by Lord Rothschild and his employee, the banker, Alfred Milner. Itsaid:> “His Majesty’s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a> national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to> facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that> nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of> existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political> status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.” 23 What a sick joke the bit about the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewishcommunities turned out to be. One of the most important secret societies withinthe Illuminati web is called the Round Table. It is based in Britain withbranches across the world, and it is the Round Table that orchestrates thenetwork of the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations, TrilateralCommission and the Royal Institute of International Affairs detailed in my otherbooks. How fascinating then, that Lord Balfour was an inner circle member of theRound Table; Alfred Milner was the Round Table’s official leader after the deathof its founder, Cecil Rhodes; and the Round Table was funded by … Lord LionelWalter Rothschild. These were the very three people involved in the BalfourDeclaration. Two years later, in 1919, came the Versailles Peace Conference nearParis when the elite of the Round Table from Britain and the United States,people like Alfred Milner, Edward Mandel House and Bernard Baruch, wereappointed to represent their countries at the meetings that decided how theworld would be changed as a result of the war these same people had engineered.They decided to impose impossible reparations payments on Germany, so ensuringthe collapse of the post-war Weimar Republic amid unbelievable economic mayhemand thus create the very circumstances that brought Hitler and the Nazis topower. It was at the Versailles conference that these Illuminati front menagreed to support the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and every oneof them was either a Rothschild bloodline or controlled by them. Today it isstill the same. The Rothschilds are extremely close to people in ‘power’ likethe Bushes, Hillary Clinton, British royal family, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown,Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Peter Mandelson, the long-time Blair‘guru’. Evelyn de Rothschild and his wife, the American-born businesswoman, LynnForester, spent their wedding night at the White House at the invitation of Billand Hillary Clinton and Lady de Rothschild has publicly stated her support forBlair and his Labour Party. This includes fundraising. She says she is asupporter of ‘Third Way’ politics, the “balance” (it claims) between Left andRight.24 The Third Way is actually an example of the Illuminati technique calledthe Hegelian Dialectic when you play off one extreme against another and fusethem together.Zionism is a political movement, not a peopleZionism was the creation of the Ashkenazi/Khazar leadership, especially theHouse of Rothschild. What most people don’t realise is that Jewish people andthe political movement called Zionism are not the same thing. It is like sayingthe Republican Party in the United States is the American nation or Blair’sLabour Party is the British nation. Large numbers of Jewish people are deeplyopposed to the goals and claims of Zionism, but their views don’t get reported.An example is the Neturei Karta movement, a grouping of Jewish peoplecampaigning to expose the truth about Zionism. Their spokesman, Rabbi AhronCohen, issued a statement to members of the UK parliament saying that theyexpressed “a religious and humanitarian philosophy held in essence by largenumbers (hundreds of thousands) and possibly the majority of “authentic OrthodoxJews”. It was a philosophy “totally opposed to the attitude adopted by theZionists and to Zionism as a whole”.25 Rabbi Cohen said the Zionist movementfounded about 100 years ago based on secular nationalistic aims, was a “completeabandonment of our religious teachings and faith …” The ideology of Zionism wasto take the law into one’s own hands and to try to force the outcome in the formof a State irrespective of the cost in life and property to anyone who stands inthe way. “The Palestinians stood in the way”, he said. Rabbi Cohen condemned thepractical outcome of Zionism “in the form of the State known as Israel” as“completely alien to Judaism and the Jewish Faith”. It had been, and continuedto be, the cause of untold suffering and bloodshed, both Jewish and non-Jewish:> “The apparent connection between Judaism and Zionism is false. The connection> has been nurtured by the Zionists in order to ensnare as many Jews as possible> within their net.” 26 Many will be surprised at those words because we only hear in the media fromZionist fronts like the Anti-Defamation League, which, in true Orwellianfashion, spends its time defaming people, including me. Is the Illuminati agendaa Jewish plot, as some claim? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. But is the politicalmovement called Zionism involved? Absolutely it is. See the articles by HenryMakow, whose family suffered under the Nazis, for more background to this;27 andthe works of Jewish writers such as Israel Shamir28 and Norman Finkelstein.29The Zionists are furious when such people speak out because they cannot crediblyaccuse them of being anti-Jewish or ‘anti-Semitic’ – the usual defense againstexposure. Finkelstein, the New York-born son of concentration camp survivors,says that Jewish organisations are “huckstering” the Holocaust by extractinghuge sums in compensation through the Zionist-controlled ‘Claims Conference’ andother agencies that the survivors never see. He says his father receivedcompensation from the German government totalling $250,000, yet his mother’scompensation, channelled through American Jewish organisations, came to a totalof just $3,500 and no pension.30 “What they have done, by turning the centraltragedy of Jews in the 20th century into a weapon for shaking down people formoney is pretty disgusting; it’s wretched”, he said.31 Finkelstein writes:> “The reported annual salary of Saul Kagan [‘Kagan’ was the name for the Khazar> king] long-time Executive Secretary of the Claims Conference is $105,000.> Between stints at the Conference, Kagan was convicted of 33 counts of wilfully> misapplying funds and credit while heading a New York bank. (The conviction> was overturned only after multiple appeals.) Alfonse D’Amato, the ex-Senator> from New York, mediates Holocaust lawsuits against German and Austrian banks> for $350 an hour plus expenses. For the first 6 months of his labours, he took> $103,000 … Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of State under President [father]> Bush [and executive of the notorious Kissinger Associates], earns an annual> salary of $300,000 as chair of the International Commission On Holocaust-Era> Insurance Claims … Kagan rings up in 12 days, Eagleburger in 4 days, and> D’Amato in 10 hours what my mother received in suffering six years of Nazi> persecution.” 32 Finkelstein estimates that more than $20 billion has been collected incompensation claims arising from the Holocaust, including the $1.25 billion hesays was extorted from Swiss banks before the evidence to support the claim ofstealing funds from Jewish victims of the Nazis was produced. When an officialinquiry later reported, it did not support the allegations on which the moneyhad been demanded – and paid under the threat of an economic boycott – in acampaign led by Edgar Bronfman, the President of the World Jewish Congress(WJC). Bronfman said the money had to be paid before the inquiry reportedbecause the victims were old and needed the money before they died. Once themoney was in the coffers however, handing it out to the victims was suddenly notnearly so urgent. Bronfman told the US House Banking Committee that the Swissshould “not be allowed to make a profit from the ashes of the Holocaust”. But helater acknowledged that the “WJC treasury has amassed no less than ‘roughly $7billion’ in compensation monies”.33 Readers of my other books will have comeacross the multi-billionaire Bronfman family in Canada who built their media andliquor empire on the back of illegal booze running and organized crime. TheBronfmans are connected to the unbelievably corrupt Anti- Defamation League(ADL), a major Illuminati operation. A taxpayer sued the Canadian government’stax-collecting scam, Revenue Canada, for allowing the Bronfmans to transfer hugesums of money to a cross-border trust fund without paying an estimated $300 to$600 million in taxes. I’m sure the Bronfman ‘influence’ on the Canadiangovernment machine had nothing to do with this.I thoroughly recommend Finkelstein’s book, The Holocaust Industry, if you wishto see the levels to which self-styled, self-appointed ‘Jewish leaders’ can sinkin their unspeakable abuse and manipulation of genuine survivors of NaziGermany. The Israeli writer, Boas Evron, concluded: “Holocaust awareness is anofficial, propagandistic indoctrination, a churning out of slogans and a falseview of the world, the real aim of which is not at all an understanding of thepast, but a manipulation of the present.” 34 Finkelstein emphasises thedifference between what he calls the “Nazi Holocaust” and the extortion rackethe terms, “The Holocaust”, which fills the coffers of Jewish organisations andprojects and not the pockets of those who genuinely suffered. Finkelsteinaccuses Jewish organisations of behaving “like a caricature from Der Sturmer” –the infamous racist magazine of the Nazis. He refers to them as “crooks” and hasdescribed Elie Wiesel, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, as the “residentclown of the Holocaust circus”. He goes on:> “Before June 1967 [the Arab-Israeli war] the universalist message of> concentration camp survivor Bruno Bettelheim resonated among American Jews.> After the June war, Bettelheim was shunted aside in favor of Wiesel. Wiesel’s> prominence is a function of his ideological utility. Uniqueness of Jewish> suffering/uniqueness of the Jews, ever-guilty Gentiles/ever-innocent Jews,> unconditional defense of Israel/unconditional defense of Jewish interests:> Elie Wiesel is The Holocaust.” 35 When the Holocaust museum was planned for Washington DC, Wiesel led the campaignto commemorate only Jewish victims and not the others targeted by the Nazis,including the handicapped.36 Wiesel rebuked Israel’s Shimon Peres for speakingof two holocausts of the 20th century, Auschwitz and Hiroshima.37 Finkelsteinhighlights some of Wiesel’s strange remarks. Wiesel said in his memoirs that heread a book called The Critique of Pure Reason in Yiddish, while saying that hewas “wholly ignorant of Yiddish grammar”.38 Even worse, the book was nevertranslated into Yiddish. Wiesel also told a New York Times reporter that he washit by a car in Times Square at 45th Street and “flew an entire block” to landin 44th.39 He’s definitely a man you can believe. It was Wiesel who wrote in theNew York Times Book Review that a tome called The Painted Bird by “Holocaustsurvivor”, Jerzy Kosinski, was “one of the best indictments of the Nazi era” and“written with deep sincerity and sensitivity”.40 Well not exactly becauseKosinski turned out to be a fraud who made it all up. Another book on the samesubject called Fragments won the Jewish National Book Award before its“Holocaust surviving” author, Binjamin Wilkomirski, was exposed as (a) not beingJewish and (b) spending the entire war in Switzerland. But, as Finkelsteinwrites, questioning is not allowed. It’s racist:> “To question a survivor’s testimony, to denounce the role of Jewish> collaborators, to suggest that Germans suffered during the bombing of Dresden> or that any state except Germany committed crimes in World War II – this is> all [claimed to be] evidence … of Holocaust denial. And to suggest that Wiesel> has profited from the Holocaust Industry, or even to question him, amounts to> Holocaust denial.” 41 Norman Finkelstein has faced the wrath of his targets and says the New YorkTimes gave a more hostile review to his book, The Holocaust Industry, than itdid to Hitler’s Mein Kampf. “I don’t want to play the martyr, but if you look atmy history I didn’t make out so well”, he said, “I’m in exile in [DePaulUniversity] Chicago because I was thrown out of every [university] school in NewYork.” 42 Jewish people as a whole are being conned as much, if not more, thananyone. Jack Bernstein, who is, like Arthur Koestler, an Ashkenazi, confirms thebackground I have highlighted:> “The powerful Zionist propaganda machine has led the American people to> believe that a Jew is a Jew – one race of people and that they are ‘God’s> Chosen People’ … First, it is important for you to understand that Jews are> not one race of people. There are two distinct groups of Jews in the world and> they come from two different areas of the world – the Sephardic Jews from the> Middle East and North Africa, and the Ashkenazi Jews come from Eastern [and> later Western] Europe. The Sephardic is the oldest group and it is they, if> any, who are the Jews described in the Bible. They are blood relatives to the> Arabs – the only difference between them is religion. > “The Ashkenazi Jews, who now comprise 90% of the Jews in the world, had a> rather strange beginning. According to historians, many of them Jewish, the> Ashkenazi Jews came into existence about 1200 years ago … [as the Khazars] …> Some time during the 13th century, the Khazars were driven from their land and> they migrated westward with most of them settling in Poland and Russia. These> Khazars are now known as Ashkenazi Jews. Because these Khazar (Ashkenazi) Jews> merely chose Judaism, they are not really Jews – at least not blood Jews.” 43 ‘The Ashkenazi leadership’ using people who are not Jewish by blood and nothistorically-connected to the lands of Israel, took over Palestine on anhistorical fabrication and have controlled the country ever since!! Sam Hamod, aformer advisor to the US State Department and former editor of Third World Newsin Washington, took up this theme in an Internet article.44 He wrote that“actual genetic Jews” were born in the Middle East and were known as SephardicJews. These Jews did speak a Semitic language, Hebrew, from their earliestincarnation, but later also spoke Aramaic, Arabic and Amharic because of theirlocation in Jerusalem and other Middle Eastern cities like what are now AddisAbaba, Cairo, Baghdad and Damascus. “One rarely hears a Sephardic Jew yelling,‘anti-Semite’”, he said, “because they know better and because he is aware ofhis own history within Semitic language speaking lands.” Hamod continued:> “… most of those Ashkenazim Jews who were born and raised in America, such as> Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Feith, are not even Jews genetically,> because they are descended from Slavic tribes known as the Khazars who> converted to Judaism and whose native language was Slavic and whose first> language in America has been English … I am not saying all Ashkenazim are not> Jews, but the way some of them behave is certainly not in the way Moses> brought Judaism from God through the Torah. One has but to look at the haters> and war-mongers in the Bush circle of influence and this is evident; no God> would want them to be associated with his name. Thus, as a friend of mine,> Rabbi Shmuel Handelman put it, ‘They may call themselves Jews, but I doubt> very much if I’d call them that, and if I did, I’d say they were the worst of> what any person might be. I’d rather not be associated with them’.” 45 Rabbi Handelman is not alone. In an impassioned article headed “Because We AreJews”, Rabbi Mordechi Weberman pledged his support for the just treatment of thePalestinian people. I have included the full text in Appendix III[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1798230] because it is important to knowthat all people calling themselves Jewish do not think the same. But this iswhat the Ashkenazi/Khazar leadership, like the Rothschilds, want the world tothink. If they can sell the belief in ‘one Jewish voice’ it means they canpromote their own ‘voice’ and their own agenda under the banner of the ‘Jewishpeople’. Rabbi Weberman said there were those who asked why they marched withthe Palestinians? Why did they raise the Palestinian flag? Why did they supportthe Palestinian cause? “You are Jews!” they said. “What are you doing?” Hisresponse was simple:> “It is precisely because we are Jews that we march with the Palestinians and> raise their flag! It is precisely because we are Jews that we demand that the> Palestinian peoples be returned to their homes and properties! Yes, in our> Torah we are commanded to be fair. We are called upon to pursue justice. And> what could be more unjust than the century-old attempt of the Zionist movement> to invade another people’s land, to drive them out and steal their property? > “We have no doubt that would Jewish refugees have come to Palestine not with> the intention of dominating, not with the intention of making a Jewish state,> not with the intention of dispossessing, not with the intention of depriving> the Palestinians of their basic rights, that they would have been welcomed by> the Palestinians, with the same hospitality that Islamic peoples have shown> Jews throughout history. And we would have lived together as Jews and Muslims> lived before in Palestine in peace and harmony.” 46 In a message to “our Islamic and Palestinian friends”, Rabbi Weberman said thereare Jews around the world that supported their cause. “There should be anapology to the Palestinian people which is clear and precise”, he wrote.“Zionism did you wrong. Zionism stole your homes. Zionism stole your land.” Hesaid they proclaimed before the world that they are the people of the Torah andthat their faith demanded that they be honest and fair, good and kind:> “We have attended hundreds of pro-Palestinian rallies over the years and> everywhere we go the leaders and audience greet us with the warmth of Middle> Eastern hospitality. What a lie it is to say that Palestinians in particular> or Muslims in general hate Jews. You hate injustice. Not Jews.” 47 Rabbi Ahron Cohen in his statement for the Neturei Karta group said the Zionistshave made themselves appear to be representatives and spokespeople of all Jewsand thus their actions aroused animosity against the Jews. “But, this is simplynot true! Zionism is not Judaism. Zionists cannot speak in the name of Jews.” 48According to the Torah and Jewish faith, he said, the present Palestinian Arabclaim to rule in Palestine was right and just – the Zionist claim was wrong andcriminal:> “One must add to this wrong, the fact that in order to achieve an ill> conceived nationalistic ambition, a shocking contravention of natural and> humanitarian justice was committed by the Zionists in setting up an> illegitimate regime in Palestine completely against the wishes of the> established population, the Palestinians, which inevitably had to be based on> loss of life, killing and stealing.” 49 He said this was a tragedy for the Palestinians and also for the Jewish people.When did you last hear these authentic voices of the Jewish faith express thesevalues in the mainstream media? Of course not, because this view is suppressedby the supporters of the Illuminati political movement called Zionism that mustadvance the lie that they speak for all Jewish people. When non-Jews challengetheir actions they are dubbed an “anti-Semite” and when Jewish people do thesame they are dubbed “self-haters” by these students of Machiavelli andGoebbels. For a Jewish person to speak out for universal justice is to be a“self-hater”? What? These guys are sick.Now that Israel exists, the Israelis and Palestinians will have to live togetherin mutual respect if the violence is to end. However, peace is not wanted by thezealots behind the takeover of the Middle East and their murderous andmanipulating intelligence arm, the Rothschild-controlled Mossad. Only thedestruction of the Arab world is enough for them. To make these points is not“anti-Semitism” – the label used to stop legitimate debate and research. It issimply provable fact as the documents highlighted in this book reveal. The ironyof this abusive term, “anti- Semitic”, is that the overwhelming majority of‘Jewish’ people are not Semitic because they come from southern Russia, not theMiddle East. And, anyway, ‘Semitic’ refers to language-speaking, not genetics.The major Semite peoples of the Middle East are actually the Arabs! Greg Felton,a Canadian writer and specialist on Middle East affairs, said:> “… What we know as the ‘Jewish State’ of Israel is really an ethnocentric> garrison state established by a non-Semitic people for the declared purpose of> dispossessing and terrorizing a civilian Semitic people. In fact from Nov. 27,> 1947, to May 15, 1948, more that 300,000 Arabs were forced from their homes> and villages. By the end of the year, the number was close to 800,000 by> Israeli estimates. Today, Palestinian refugees number in the millions.” 50 Supporting the nazisAnother irony is that those calling themselves Jewish have suffered terriblyover the years from the manipulations and agenda of those who rule them. Look atNazi Germany where the mass of the Ashkenazi people were treated grotesquelywhile their leaders collaborated with their fascist persecutors, who were fundedby Ashkenazi bankers and the British and American elite, including the Bushfamily. President Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, was involved with theHarriman Empire in the funding of the Nazis through a company called the UnionBanking Corporation (UBC) and virtually all the Nazi trade with the UnitedStates was under the control of the Harriman interests and the stewardship ofPrescott Bush. The Union Bank interfaced with the steel and banking empire ofHitler funder, Fritz Thyssen, whose factories built the Nazi war machinery. TheUBC was closed down for trading with the enemy and one might ask whyprofessional ‘Nazi hunters’ like Simon Wiesenthal have never pursued the Bushfamily?? The Bush-Nazi connection has been highlighted by John Loftus, thepresident of the Florida Holocaust Museum, who pointed out that Prescott Bushderived a portion of his personal fortune from his affiliation with the UBC.Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department’s Nazi War Crimes Unit,said that leading Nazi industrialists secretly owned the ‘Harriman/Bush’ bankand they were moving money into the UBC through a second bank in Holland evenafter the United States declared war on Germany. The bank was liquidated in1951, Loftus said, and President Bush’s grandfather and great-grandfatherreceived $1.5 million as part of that dissolution. He said he had a file ofpaperwork linking the bank and Prescott Bush to Nazi money. “That’s where theBush family fortune came from: It came from the Third Reich”, Loftus said in aspeech during the Sarasota Reading Festival.51 The German publishing giant,Bertelsmann, is owned by the Thielens, who are reported to be related to FritzThyssen. Bertelsmann published Hitler’s book, Mein Kampf, and was the biggestprinter for the German army through its close ties to the Nazi PropagandaMinistry of Joseph Goebbels. In 2002, the company was exposed for its Naziconnections and for using Jewish slave labour.52 (See And The Truth Shall SetYou Free and The Biggest Secret for the Illuminati background to the Naziconcentration camps and the Bush family and House of Windsor connections to theThird Reich). A Bertelsmann subsidiary in California has refused to print mybooks on the command of the German headquarters. Good. The majority ofJewish-Americans apparently voted against Bush in 2000 and the number would havebeen even higher had they known the family connections to the Nazis and who andwhat was behind his rise to the presidency. Canadian writer Greg Felton saidthis of the Zionist support for the Nazis:> “Israel would not be possible today if the World Zionist Congress and other> Zionist agencies hadn’t formed common cause with Hitler’s exterminators to rid> Europe of Jews. In exchange for helping round up non-Zionist Jews, sabotage> Jewish resistance movements and betray the trust of Jews, Zionists secured for> themselves safe passage to Palestine. This arrangement was formalized in a> number of emigration agreements signed in 1938. The most notorious case of> Zionist collusion concerned Dr Rudolf Kastner, Chairman of the Zionist> Organization in [Khazar] Hungary from 1943-45. To secure the safe passage of> 600 Zionists to Palestine, he helped the Nazis send 800,000 Hungarian Jews to> their deaths. The Israeli Supreme Court virtually whitewashed Kastner’s crimes> because to admit them would have denied Israel the moral right to exist.” 53 Or, as David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, said in a letter tothe Zionist executive on December 17th 1938:> “The saving of Jewish lives from Hitler is considered here as a potential> threat to Zionism, unless they are brought to Palestine. When Zionism had to> choose between the Jewish people and the Jewish state, it unhesitatingly> preferred the latter.” 54 Alfred Rosenberg, the “intellectual leader” of the Nazi Party, is reported tohave had ‘Jewish’[that is Ashkenazi] ancestry.55 It was Rosenberg who gave theProtocols of the Wise Men of Zion to Hitler. These were purported to revealplans for world domination alleged to have been presented at the Jewish WorldCongress held in Basel in 1897 and were used to ‘justify’ the horrificpersecution of Jews in Germany (although not the Ashkenazi leaders involved withthe Nazi Party). Rosenberg, who was born in Estonia, became editor of theVoelkischer Beobachter, the official Nazi Party newspaper, and he wrote The Mythof the Twentieth Century, which claimed that the Aryan race was the creator ofall values and culture while the Jews were agents of cultural corruption. UnderRosenberg’s command, Jewish libraries throughout Europe were ransacked and thespoils delivered to him in Frankfurt. He also headed a special unit, EinsatzstabRosenberg, which plundered art and furniture belonging to Jews in occupiedWestern Europe.56 Ernst Hanfstaengl, a close friend of US president FranklinRoosevelt, was also a close associate of Hitler before the war. He says he waswarned by the Austrian writer, Rudolf Kommer, that “if any political partyemerges with an anti-Semitic programme directed by Jewish or half Jewishfanatics we shall have to watch out”. Hanfstaengl wrote that later, afterexperiencing the influence that Alfred Rosenberg had over Hitler, he began torealise what that remark really meant:> “I thought back to Rudolf Kommer’s remark about an anti-Semitic programme> directed by Jewish or half Jewish fanatics – Rosenberg was distinctly Jewish> in appearance, although he would have been the first to protest furiously if> anyone had questioned his ancestry. Yet I used to see him most mornings> sitting in a dingy café at the corner of Briennerstrasse and Augustenstrasse> with a Hungarian Jew named Holoschi, who was one of his principle assistants.> The man called himself Hollander in Germany and was another of these Jewish> anti-Semites … I suspected the [alleged] Aryan background of many of the> others. Strasser and Streicher looked Jewish to me as well as figures like> Ley, Frank and even Goebbels, who would have had difficulty in proving their> pedigree.” 57 Rosenberg and Goebbels worked closely together at the Propaganda Ministry. Nevermind Rosenberg’s own ancestry, what was he doing with a “principle assistant”that was Jewish when Rosenberg was one of the major architects of the masterrace madness and the persecution of Jews? This is only one of endless‘anomalies’ that can only be explained when you realise that the Jewish massesand their elite ‘leadership’ are working to very different agendas. The GermanAshkenazi banker, Max Warburg, was a director of I. G. Farben, the chemical andpharmaceutical giant, that ran the concentration camp at Auschwitz and was atthe heart of Hitler’s war machine (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Hisbrother, Paul Warburg, who was behind the creation of the Illuminati’s FederalReserve banking system that controls the American economy, was a director of theUS arm of I.G. Farben. Moshe Gottlieb reveals in his book, American Anti-NaziResistance ’33 – ’41, that Max Warburg’s son, Erich, cabled his cousin,Frederick Warburg, a director of the Union Pacific Railroad, telling him to useall his influence to stop all anti-Nazi propaganda and activity in America,including “atrocity news and unfriendly propaganda in foreign press, massmeetings, etc”. Frederick cabled back to Erich: “No responsible groups here[are] urging [a] boycott [of] German goods, merely excited individuals.” Twodays later, on March 31st 1933, the Warburg-controlled American Jewish Committeeand the B’nai B’rith, heavily influenced by the Sultzbergers of the New YorkTimes, issued an official joint statement saying “no American boycott againstGermany be encouraged” and advised “no further mass meetings be held or similarforms of agitation be employed”. Journalist John L. Spivak exposed the Warburgconnections to the Nazis in an article in 1934 headed “Wall Street’s FascistConspiracy”.58 He revealed that the Warburgs controlled the American JewishCommittee that opposed the anti-Nazi boycott, while their Kuhn Loeb and Co. hadunderwritten Nazi shipping. He further exposed the Warburg financing ofpro-fascist political activities with their partners and allies, many of whomwere major figures in the American Jewish Committee and B’nai B’rith (whichformed the Illuminati Anti- Defamation League in 1913). Support for the Nazis bythe Ashkenazi leadership was fundamental to Hitler’s war machine and this thenled directly to the unimaginable suffering of the Ashkenazi masses in Germany.It was this very suffering that the Ashkenazi ‘leaders’, most notably theRothschilds, used to campaign for a homeland in Israel – a land to which atleast the vast majority had no blood or historical connection whatsoever. Afterthe war, leading Zionist fronts continued to support right-wing groups or ignoretheir actions when it suited them. Norman Finkelstein writes that, “Jewishelites even enlisted in, and financially sustained, right-wing extremistorganisations like the All American Conference to Combat Communism and turned ablind eye as veterans of the Nazi SS entered the country.” 59Why would the Rothschilds and other leading ‘Jewish’ families do all this totheir own people? It is a horrendous thought and doesn’t make sense, surely? Tounderstand why this can happen – and why the Bush family can so abuse ‘fellow’Americans – we need to appreciate that the Illuminati elite have a differentbloodline to the general population. They are a group unto themselves who are‘hiding’ within other races and nations. The Rothschild family and company mayhave come out of the Khazar Empire, but we should not confuse that with the massof the former Khazar, now Ashkenazim, peoples. The Rothschild allegiance is notto them, but to the agenda of their real family, the nature of which I willreveal later. In other words, a Rothschild plot isn’t a ‘Jewish’ plot.Erased from historyThere is another important question that arises from all this. Even without the‘Jewish’- Ashkenazi connection, the Khazar Empire was enormously significant toworld history. As Arthur Koestler says, “The Khazars had their fingers in manyhistoric pies”.60 The way the Khazars secured Eastern Europe from the invadingMuslims alone is of massive significance. But were you ever told the history ofthe Khazars at school or anywhere else? Isn’t it one hell of a coincidence thaton one hand the Khazar story challenges the entire foundation of Zionism and onthe other the Khazars and their background have been pretty much erased fromhistory? Benjamin H. Freedman, the former ‘Jewish’ businessman who campaignedceaselessly against Zionism, said that in 1948, the year that Israel wasfounded, he addressed “a large assembly of the highest ranking officers of theUnited States Army” at the Pentagon and told them about the Khazars and theirrelationship to the people of Israel. Afterwards, he said, he was approached bya Lieutenant Colonel, the head of the history department of “one of the largestand highest scholastic rated institutions of higher education in the UnitedStates”. The man had taught history there for 16 years, Freedman said, but hehad never in all his career as a history teacher or otherwise heard the word‘Khazar’ before that day. Freedman told this story in correspondence with a DrDavid Goldstein in 1954. He went on:> “Research … revealed that [the Khazar ‘Jews’] were never ‘Semites’, are not> ‘Semites’ now, nor can they ever be regarded as ‘Semites’ at any future time> by any stretch of the imagination. Exhaustive research also irrevocably> rejects as a fantastic fabrication the generally accepted belief by Christians> that the so-called or self-styled ‘Jews’ in Eastern Europe are the legendary> ‘Chosen People’ so very vocally publicized by the Christian clergy from their> pulpits. Maybe you can explain to me, my dear Dr Goldstein, the reason why and> just how the origin and the history of the Khazars and Khazar Kingdom was so> well concealed from the world for so many centuries? What secret mysterious> power has been able for countless generations to keep the origin and the> history of the Khazars and Khazar Kingdom out of history text-books and out of> class-room courses in history throughout the world? > “The origin and history of the Khazars and Khazar Kingdom are certainly> incontestable historical facts. These … facts also establish beyond any> question of doubt the origin and history of the so-called or self-styled> ‘Jews’ in Eastern Europe. The origin and history of the Khazars and Khazar> kingdom and their relationship to the origin and early history of the> so-called or self-styled ‘Jews’ in Eastern Europe was one of history’s best> kept secrets until wide publicity was given in recent years to my research on> this subject. Do you not think, my dear Dr Goldstein, that it is time this> whole subject was dragged out of its hiding place?” 61 That was written in 1954. We are still waiting.There is no Jewish ‘race’The evidence insists that we must go even further than suggesting the Ashkenazimare not genetically ‘Jewish’. There is, in fact, no such thing as a Jewish‘race’, just as there is no Aryan ‘race’ in the way it is portrayed by the whitesupremacists. These are fabrications of history. What should ‘race’ matteranyway? It’s all illusion and childish beyond belief. Later in the book, when weexplore the illusory nature of reality, we can appreciate even more profoundlythe nonsense of ‘race’ and how stupid it is to judge people on the genetics oftheir body. In truth, no race exists, except in the minds of the people, as weshall see. It is all illusion. Unfortunately ‘race’ and its related historical‘rights’ and claims are used as a political tool and source of mindmanipulation. This is why I am spending time exposing some of the background.There are people who follow the Jewish faith all over the world. There are white‘Jews’, brown ‘Jews’, black ‘Jews’, Spanish ‘Jews’, Chinese ‘Jews’ etc., etc,that follow that belief system and good luck to them so long as they don’t forceit on anyone else. If they want to call themselves ‘Jewish’ on the basis oftheir faith then please feel free, it’s none of my business. But there is not aJewish ‘race’, let alone a ‘chosen people’. Arthur Koestler points out thatpeople calling themselves ‘Jewish’ across the globe have far more in commongenetically with the “host” population than they do with each other. This washighlighted by Professor Juan Comas in his work, The Race Question in ModernScience, published by UNESCO, and by Raphael Patai in the EncyclopaediaBritannica:> “The findings of physical anthropology show that, contrary to popular view,> there is no Jewish race. Anthropometric measurements of Jewish groups in many> parts of the world indicate that they differ greatly from one another with> respect to all the important physical characteristics – stature, weight, skin> colour, cephalic index, facial index, blood groups, etc.” 62 Harry Shapiro produced the same assessment in his UNESCO work, The JewishPeople: A Biological History:> “The wide range of variation between Jewish populations in their physical> characteristics and the diversity of the gene frequencies of their blood> groups render any unified classification for them a contradiction in terms.> For although modern racial theory admits some degree of polymorphism or> variation within a racial group, it does not permit distinctly different> groups, measured by its own criteria of race, to be identified as one. To do> so would make the biological purposes of racial classification futile and the> whole procedure arbitrary and meaningless. Unfortunately, this subject is> rarely wholly divorced from non-biological considerations, and despite the> evidence efforts continue to be made to somehow segregate Jews as a distinct> racial entity.” 63 The reason for the latter is obvious by now. It is to sell a false history andbiology both to the mass of those who consider themselves ‘Jewish’ and to therest of humanity. How can you claim to be a special race, a ‘chosen people’considered by ‘God’ to be above all others, and with special rights given by‘God’ to own a certain piece of land, when there is no such thing as a ‘Jewishrace’? Even the ‘Jewish nose’ is only a facial feature of a fraction of ‘Jewish’people and, here’s the point, the same “Jewish nose” is found in far greaternumbers today among the Caucasian tribes and the Turks of Asia Minor. Among thetruly Semite peoples it is not seen at all. During the Babylonian exile the‘Israelites’, including members of the priestly families, married Gentiles. AsKoestler says, even before the Diaspora (the ‘Scattering’) the Israelites were a“thoroughly hybridized race”. (There could be one exception to this, as I willexplore in chapter nine [../Text/index_split_024.html#filepos903624].) Such‘hybridization’ applied to most historic nations, writes Koestler, “and thepoint would not need stressing if it were not for the persistent myth of theBiblical Tribe having preserved its racial purity throughout the ages.” 64 Heconcludes his excellent book:> “To sum up, the Jews of our day have no cultural tradition in common, merely> certain habits and behaviour-patterns, derived by social inheritance from the> traumatic experience of the ghetto, and from a religion which the majority> does not practice or believe in, but nevertheless confers on them a> pseudo-national status … the lingering influence of Judaism’s racial and> historical message, though based on illusion, acts as a powerful emotional> break by appealing to tribal loyalty.” 65 This emotion and fear, engendered not least by the events of Nazi Germany, aremercilessly exploited by their self-appointed ‘leaders’ who know the realbackground. The Ashkenazi ‘leaders’ have no more concern for the plight ofJewish people than the Bushes have for Americans. They are following an agendaand all people, no matter what their race or label, are fodder to be used andabused in its name. If those leaders were not so obsessed with race, and specialrights through race, this section of the book would not have been necessary, butthe record needs to be straightened for racist and ‘anti-racist’ alike. To thinkthat what happened in Germany is being used to advance a fascist agenda turns mystomach. But it is. I have detailed some of the background to Israel and itsprominent supporters because the suppression of these facts is being used in themanipulation of the ‘war on terrorism’ and the conquest of the Arab world, theformer empire of Sumer and Babylon.Familiar facesIt was Ashkenazi ancestors of the Khazar people who were behind the Clean Breakdocument produced for Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996 that called for Israel to“shape its strategic environment”, starting with the removal of Saddam Husseinand the installation of a Hashemite monarchy in Baghdad. With Iraq brought underJordanian Hashemite influence, Jordan and Turkey would form an axis along withIsrael to weaken and “roll back” Syria, it said. Jordan could also undermineLebanon by “weaning” the Shia Muslim population away from Syria and Iran andre-establishing their former ties with the Shia in the new Hashemite kingdom ofIraq, the document said. “Israel will not only contain its foes; it willtranscend them.” 66 To achieve this, the document stated, Israel would have towin broad American support for these new policies and it advised Netanyahu topresent them “in language familiar to the Americans by tapping into themes ofAmerican administrations during the Cold War which apply well to Israel”.67 TheGuardian article revealing the contents of the document pointed out that thereis little to distinguish the 1996 Clean Break paper from the outpourings ofother “right-wing and ultra-Zionist think-tanks”.Nor do the similarities end there. The leader of the ‘prominent opinion makers’who wrote the paper for Netanyahu was Richard Perle, now chairman of the DefensePolicy Board at the Pentagon and a major player in the orchestration of the waragainst Iraq (and whoever next). Another author was … Douglas Feith, theneo-conservative lawyer, now under-secretary of policy at the Pentagon, who isalso at the forefront of the US agenda for the conquest of the Middle East. Twoothers were David Wurmser and his wife, Meyrav, who was co-founder of Memri, aWashington-based charity that “distributes articles translated from Arabicnewspapers portraying Arabs in a bad light”.68 David Wurmser worked with Perleat the American Enterprise Institute and is now at the State Department as aspecial assistant to John Bolton, the Under-Secretary for arms control andinternational security. Bolton is yet another front-line manipulator of theinvasion of Iraq, as I mentioned earlier. Meyrav Wurmser told the BBC that theClean Break document was:> “No more than a mental exercise done in a think tank by a group of people.> Yes, many of us [behind the Bush policies] are Jewish, there’s no need to> apologise to anyone for that. Most of us, all of us in fact, are pro-Israel,> some of us more seriously so than others, but we have no problem at all with> criticising Israel.” 69 James Colbert of the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National SecurityAffairs (JINSA) was also an author of the Israeli Clean Break report in 1996.JINSA says that one of its aims is “to inform the American defense and foreignaffairs community about the important role Israel can and does play inbolstering democratic interests in the Mediterranean and the Middle East”. Inpractice, as the Guardian article pointed out, this largely involves “… sendingretired American military brass on jaunts to Israel after which many of themwrite suitably hawkish newspaper articles or letters to the editor”.70 There arealso business relationships between retired US military officers on the JINSAboard and American companies supplying weapons to Israel, but don’t ever mentionIsrael’s massive stockpile of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Shhhhh!They don’t exist, OK? Sam Hamod, a former advisor to the US State Department,said:> “Israel at this time has a huge stock of atomic weapons, thanks to our> assistance. Israel also has major supplies of anthrax and other poison> weapons, again, thanks to the assistance of the US Government who at one time> feared Arab attacks on Israel. These are the reasons that Israel will not> allow atomic inspectors into Israel and will not sign the vaunted,> American-pushed, Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that America wants everyone> else to sign, and uses pressure to achieve this, but never on Israel. > “As to the poison weapons, neither America nor Israel will sign this accord> banning poison weapons because they have so many in their security vaults.> Thus, to many experts in the world, the US attack on Iraq for WMD and poison> weapons, was very much a bald-faced farce, without merit, when two of the> biggest abusers of atomic proliferation and poison weapons were the ones> calling for the war, America and Israel (and of course, followed by the poodle> himself, Tony Blair, who has his own weapons secrets that have not yet seen> the light of day).” 71 When Saddam Hussein offered in 1990 to destroy such weapons, if Israel did thesame with theirs, the United States government said it was not willing tonegotiate on that subject – not least because to publicly accept that Israel hasa massive nuclear capability would make illegal the billions of dollars of USaid to that country every year.72 They all know of Israel’s nuclear stockpile,but if no one officially admits it exists they can go on with business as usual.This was further exposed in a BBC television documentary in the Correspondentseries in 2003 that revealed how this you-don’t-say-anything-and-I-won’tagreement is known as “nuclear expediency”. The programme highlighted theinhuman treatment of Mordechai Vanunu who had already been jailed for 17 years,11 of them in isolation, for warning the world about the production of atomicweapons in Israel. Vanunu worked for ten years in the Dimona ‘Atomic ResearchReactor’ in the Israeli southern desert region and told a reporter from theLondon Sunday Times about the secret production of nuclear weapons inunderground levels under that reactor. The report was published in October 1986and Vanunu was kidnapped in Rome by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad andshipped to Israel, where he was secretly tried and convicted. In retaliation forthe programme, the Israeli government press office, a department of the PrimeMinister’s Office, banned BBC correspondents in Israel from contact withgovernment ministers and officials and from official press conferences.73 DanielSeaman, the head of the press office, said the broadcast had served those who“demonise Israel and anti-Semitic elements”. Here we go, yawn, yawn. The truthis that the behaviour of the Israeli government demonises Israel without anyhelp from anyone else. Seaman also added that the broadcast was something a‘democratic’ [sic] State like Israel cannot tolerate.74The JINSA pincerThe Israeli Clean Break document called for the very agenda that has beenunfolding since the Bush administration came illegally to power. The authors ofthe paper were closely connected with JINSA, the Ashkenazi-controlled JewishInstitute for National Security Affairs. Today, at the heart of the Bushadministration’s policy on the conquest in the Middle East, are: Dick Cheney,Vice-President, JINSA member, formerly on its advisory board; Paul Wolfowitz,Deputy Defense Secretary, and a highly prominent member of JINSA; Richard Perle,Clean Break report author, Iraq war architect, who serves on the Pentagon PolicyBoard, JINSA member; Douglas Feith, Clean Break report author, JINSA member;David Wurmser, Clean Break report author, JINSA member, who is now specialassistant to John Bolton, the under-secretary for arms control and internationalsecurity, another JINSA member; James Woolsey, JINSA member and former directorof the CIA. These, in turn, connect into the far-right “think tanks” in theUnited States like the Project for the New American Century that produced theblueprint for conquest in September 2000. This was a mirror of the Clean Breakdocument and has formed the basis for the Bush administration’s policy of massmurder and acquisition in the Middle and Near East. How can these facts not befundamentally connected and what chance do the Arab nations have of beingtreated justly and with respect given the agenda of those in control of thegathering war against them? These people wanted to see the invasion and takeoverof Iraq, Syria, Iran, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia and that list is now being tickedoff. Tom Neumann, executive director of JINSA, told the Bush-dominated,Moonie-owned Washington Times, how he believed (knew) the face of the MiddleEast would be changed:> “Jordan will likely survive the coming war with US assistance, so will some of> the sheikhdoms. The current Saudi regime will likely not. The Iran dissident> movement would be helped enormously by the demise of Saddam, and the> Palestinians would have to know that the future lies with the West. Syria’s> Ba’athist dictatorship will likely fall unmourned, liberating Lebanon as well.> Israel and Turkey, the only current democracies in the region, will find> themselves in a far better neighbourhood.” 75 As I write, the demonisation of Syria and Iran is underway through people likethe ‘dove’ (you must be bloody joking) ‘Colon’ Powell and JINSA member PaulWolfowitz, the Deputy Defense Secretary. The US government accused the Syrianregime of President Bashar al-Assad of state terrorism, developing weapons ofmass destruction and harbouring fugitive Iraqi officials. Colon said: “We willexamine possible measures of a diplomatic, economic or other nature as we moveforward.” 76 White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer branded Syria a terroriststate; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claimed Syria had carried out achemical weapons test “over the past 12, 15 months”; and Israeli Prime MinisterAriel ‘Khazar’ Sharon joined the offensive, describing Assad as “dangerous”. Heurged Washington to put “very heavy ... political and economic pressure” onSyria.77 It is history repeating, the same technique they used with Iraq: lies,lies, lies. Wolfowitz told the Senate Armed Services Committee:> “The Syrians are behaving badly. They need to be reminded of that, and if they> continue then we need to think about what our policy is with respect to a> country that harbours terrorists or harbours war criminals, or was in recent> times shipping things to Iraq.” 78 You can’t speak the truth – it’s racistIt has all been planned for a long time and they now have to invent the excusesto carry out the agenda of mass slaughter and control. The way this inhumanpolicy was played out against Iraq is due to be repeated over and over on theroad to global domination. But speak or write any of these highly relevant factsand you are labelled (inaccurately from every angle) an anti-Semite. What, fortelling the truth? Yes, especially for telling the truth, that’s the point ofthe smear. Tam Dalyell is a veteran Labour MP who has campaigned againstcountless wars and, like his colleague George Galloway, was a vocal opponent ofthe invasion of Iraq. Dalyell said that Bush and Blair were being undulyinfluenced by Jewish ministers and officials who had an agenda for Israel thatdid not allow fair and equal treatment of the Arab world. He referred to a cabalin the United States based on the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs(JINSA) and later said he was referring to people like Paul Wolfowitz, RichardPerle, John Bolton, Douglas Feith and Ari Fleischer, Bush’s then pressspokesman. “Those people drive this policy”, he said.79 He also highlighted therole of Blair’s unelected Middle East ‘envoy’, Lord Levy, who is not a member ofthe government and cannot be questioned by parliament. Were these fair pointsmade with freedom of speech? Oh no, not in the brave new world. Professor EricMoonman, president of the Zionist Federation, who was a Labour MP from 1966 to1979, said he was seeking advice on whether there was a case for referringDalyell’s remarks to the Commission for Racial Equality under the law ofinciting racial hatred. “I believe there is”, he said.80 Well, let me tell youwhat I believe, Professor Moonman. I believe that if Dalyell had said that Bushand Blair were being unduly influenced by Arab, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Dutch,German or French etc., etc., ministers and officials, Professor Moonman’ssilence would have been deafening. So where’s the real racism? Indeed what canbe more racist than to claim you are the “Chosen People” and above all others?‘Anti-Semitism’ is a smokescreen used to stop legitimate debate and Dalyell’streatment is just another example. It is very enlightening to look into thecesspits in which wallow the major organisations behind the ‘anti-Semitic’ smearcampaigns. The Anti-Defamation League, which has tried hard to stop me having apublic platform in countries like Canada, operates by defaming people in linewith its Orwellian remit. The ADL manipulates unthinking, unquestioningmind-fodder to man the ‘anti- Semite’ protests, most of them gleaned from theludicrous ‘Left’ (as opposed to the ridiculous ‘Right’). Too many on the Leftwear their hearts on their sleeves and their brains in a dark place where theSun don’t shine. They are child’s play for the manipulators. Ironically, theAnti-Defamation League (ADL), the major orchestrator of ‘anti-Semite’ protests,is about as far from the Left as you could imagine. It connects into Mossad andthe global ‘intelligence’ network and to organised crime (mostly the same thing,anyway). The ADL gave Mo Dalitz, the Las Vegas gangster, their ‘Torch ofFreedom’ award in 1985 for donating millions of dollars to Israel. Dalitz was anassociate of the infamous mega-criminal, Meyer Lansky.In 1993, ADL offices were raided by San Francisco police and the evidence cameto light that the ‘anti-racist’ organisation had illegally obtained informationfrom Tom Gerard, a corrupt police officer, and Roy Bullock, a politicalinformant and infiltrator on the ADL payroll since 1960. Bullock was employed asa ‘fact-finder’ or what we would call a spy. He would infiltrate not only openly‘anti-Semitic’ groups, but also labour unions, pro-Palestinian, American Araband anti-apartheid organizations, usually under false pretences. Bullock, whowas not Jewish, would then pass that information to the ADL. What a thought: an‘anti-racist’ organisation keeping files on anti-apartheid campaigners. The ADLeven kept “file upon file” on liberal San Francisco Jews who disagreed withIsraeli policies. The files included Social Security numbers, driver’s licencenumbers, addresses, phone numbers and group memberships. Some of the informationwas sold to foreign governments, including Israeli and South Africanintelligence groups. Pete McCloskey, a former Republican congressman from SanMateo County, was an attorney in the law suits against the ADL. He wants thegovernment to revoke its tax-exempt status (no chance). Since they obviously areworking in conjunction with the Israeli government, he said, they shouldregister as such. “Referring to themselves as an education group is simply asham”, the attorney said.81 Dr Alfred M. Lilienthal, the author of There Goesthe Middle East, The Other Side of the Coin, and The Zionist Connection, saidthe ADL was “ever ready to apply the smear and vilification to censure andsilence, thus building an iron curtain over America that would bar anycriticism, however constructive, of Israel, Zionists, or Jews (Judaism israrely, if ever, involved) …” 82 He said that without exaggeration the ADL wasthe single most influential organization in the United States:> “It works closely with the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, and sometimes> with the FBI or CIA. Through its multi-fold activities and ability to crush> dissent, it is probably more responsible for American attitudes and American> foreign policy toward the Middle East than any other single force … Through> its multiple private and public reports and publications, allegedly directed> against prejudice and bigotry, the ADL can exert enormous influence and> intimidation, often bordering on blackmail, in organizations and individuals,> particularly people in public life. It provides an indispensable backup for …> effective lobbying of the Congress and White House on behalf of an> ever-increasing economic and military aid to Israel … Many ADL charges against> critics of Israel and Zionism are totally inaccurate, questionable, or based> upon half-truths. Its secret and confidential reports, widely distributed in> liberal circles, often attribute the stock quotation, ‘but some of my best> friends are Jews,’ to its subjects, implying anti- Semitism. Odious> impressions are created by twisting or distorting a few words, or the context> in which they were uttered.” 83 I sure know that to be true. After Israel’s attacks on Lebanon in 1996, with themassacre of more than a hundred civilians at Qana, Ari Shavit, a columnist withthe newspaper, Haaretz, said that Israel could act with impunity because “wehave the Anti-Defamation League …” 84 Its key role is to target those who arechallenging the Illuminati agenda by branding them racists and the ADLdefinition of ‘anti-Semitic’ gets wider by the day. The ADL’s Nathan Perlmutterclaimed that the “real anti- Semitism” in America consisted of policyinitiatives “corrosive of Jewish interests”, such as affirmative action, cuts inthe defence budgets, and neo-isolationism, as well as opposition to nuclearpower and even electoral reform.85 Any questioning of the ADL is racist, or, associologist John Murray Cuddihy, put it: “Not only does anything Jews do orrefrain from doing have nothing to do with anti-Semitism, but any attempt toexplain anti-Semitism by referring to the Jewish contribution to anti- Semitismis itself an instance of anti-Semitism!” 86The ADL is headed by an Ashkenazi called Abraham ‘Abe’ Foxman, who claims to bea “Holocaust survivor”, but never saw the inside of a concentration camp orsuffered persecution by the Nazis because they believed he was a Christian.Foxman accepted $100,000 for the ADL from the mega-crook billionaire, Mark Rich,and then advised him to seek a pardon for his crimes. Months later Rich’slawyers filed for a pardon and Foxman wrote to President Bill Clinton on ADLnotepaper in support of the application. The pardon was granted by Clinton inhis last hours in office amid enormous controversy.87 Foxman had suggested thepardon to his friend, Avner Azulay, an agent for Israel’s Ashkenazi spy agency,Mossad, who was head of the Rich Foundation that has donated a total of at least$250,000 to the ADL.88 Rich’s lawyer was Lewis Libby, Cheney’s Chief of Staff,and a member of the Project for the New American Century. The web is enormous.The brilliant Israeli writer, Israel Shamir, highlights the Zionist(Ashkenazi/Khazar) Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in an article on his website.89Shamir says of Foxman and other ‘anti-Semite’ propagandists:> “The chief proponent of this well-endowed movement is an American [Ashkenazi]> Jew, the head of ADL, Abe Foxman. Two years ago he was caught taking large> sums of money from the super-thief Marc Rich, a crook who cheated the American> taxpayer and found refuge in Switzerland. For years Foxman and his> organisation collected dossiers on people who objected to apartheid and sold> them to Mossad and to the South Africa of Forster. They broke into houses,> stole documents and ran professional surveillance of the left activists in> California. > “Last year, Foxman and ADL were found guilty in the US court of law, and paid> millions of dollars to people they intimidated and smeared. Foxman’s best chum> is Ariel Sharon, the mass murderer of Sabra, Shatila, Kibie and Jenin. A new> book by Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon, ‘The Assassination of Robert Maxwell:> Israel’s Super Spy’ confirms the professional philo-Semites [those who brand> their opponents “anti-Semites”] have permanent ties with Mossad, the long arm> of Israeli apartheid, memorable to you by the Lillehammer murders. In brief,> the philo-Semites are sleazy guys taking money from sleazy crooks in order to> cover up the creeping genocide of Palestinians … > “ ... It is not strange, as the very emphasis on ‘anti-Semitism’ is> disgustingly racist, as if it were worse than racism against anyone else.> People who decry ‘anti-Semitism’, instead of ‘racism’ or ‘ethnic-prejudice’,> are actually saying that there is something really special – and particularly> bad – about discrimination against this one particular group. In other words,> they are racists.” 90 Sam Hamod, a former advisor to the US State Department, said the Anti-Defamation League had made a fortune in donations by conning most media networksand most people in the world into believing an untruth about Jewish history andsuppressing the Khazar origins. He said that when the ADL called someonecritical of Israel, Zionists or Zionism, an “anti-Semite”, this was purenonsense. He said he was not “touting for people who are anti-Jewish oranti-Arab, or anti-any ethnic or racial group”. Those who stereotyped orattacked others based on their race or ethnicity were dead wrong and should becondemned, he said.91> “But so too should those who abuse labels and use them wrongly to stop others> from being justifiably critical should also be condemned (and in this case, I> am referring to the ADL and other groups of that sort who label people with> impunity and carelessness, sometimes wrecking their careers, their> reputations, their businesses and their lives!) > “Unfortunately, the misuse of the label, ‘anti-Semitic’ and its consequences> have been so bad that even presidents, senators, congress people, media giants> and all others in the world cringe at being labelled, ‘anti-Semitic’ by some> Zionist, Israeli or ignorant religious, media or social group. Little do they> know they are being victimized by charlatans of the language who have found a> label that they throw around with impunity and for which there has been little> or no come-back.” 92 It was time for media people and non-linguistically literate scholars,politicians, religious leaders and others to become educated about the truthsabout “Semitic” and its misuse, he said. “If not, we’ll continue to allowcharlatans to abuse our language and to continue their name-calling, abusingothers, including Jews, Arabs, Americans, Brits and others by calling them‘anti-Semites’ if they speak against Israel (which is not a Semitic state) orZionists (a political group, not exclusively Jewish and which has nothing to dowith Semitic).” 93 The claims of “anti-Semitism” have served the Ashkenazileadership magnificently. Dr Nahun Goldman, former president of the World JewishCongress, said: “Current decline of overt anti- Semitism might constitute a newdanger to Jewish survival … The disappearance of anti-Semitism in its classicmeaning, while beneficial to the political and material situation of Jewishcommunities, has had a very negative effect on our internal life.” 94 LeoPfeffer of the American Jewish Congress also said it was possible that someanti-Semitism is necessary in order to insure Jewish survival.95 Or rather thesurvival of Zionism. Norman Finkelstein has seen it all before:> “By the 1970s, anti-Semitism was no longer a salient feature of American life.> Nonetheless, Jewish leaders started sounding alarm bells that American Jewry> was threatened by a virulent ‘new anti-Semitism’. The main exhibits of a> prominent ADL study (‘for those who have died because they are Jews’) included> the Broadway show Jesus Christ Superstar and a counterculture tabloid that> ‘portrayed Kissinger as a fawning sycophant, coward, bully, flatterer, tyrant,> social climber, evil manipulator, insecure snob, unprincipled seeker after> power’ – in the event, an understatement. > “For organised American Jewry, this contrived hysteria over a new> anti-Semitism served multiple purposes. It boosted Israel’s stock as the> refuge of last resort if and when American Jews needed one. Moreover, the> fund-raising appeals of Jewish organisations purportedly combating> anti-Semitism [like the ADL] fell on more receptive ears. ‘The anti-Semite is> in the unhappy position’, Sartre once observed, ‘of having a vital need for> the very enemy he wishes to destroy’. For these Jewish organisations the> reverse is equally true. With anti-Semitism in short supply, a cutthroat> rivalry between major Jewish ‘defense’ organisations – in particular, the ADL> and the Simon Wiesenthal Center – has erupted in recent years.” 96 Don’t do as I do – do as I sayThese are the organisations and methods used to stop investigation into those atthe heart of power as I, and many others, have found. Those on the Left who fallfor this are helping to create the very fascist society they claim to beopposing. Here is a definition of fascism: a system of government marked bycentralisation of authority under a dictator, stringent socio-economic controls,suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically apolicy of belligerent nationalism and racism; a political philosophy or movementbased on or advocating such a system of government.; oppressive, dictatorialcontrol. Recognise it? This is the world we are living in now and they havehardly started yet. Fascism is not a race and it is not a body, it is a state ofmind. Anyone of any race is capable of promoting fascism. The Left does not seemable to grasp that simple reality. BBC reporter Steve Bradshaw said in hisPanorama documentary on the ‘neo-cons’:> “By now we had picked up a recurrent theme of insider talk in Washington. Some> leading neo-cons, people whisper, are strongly pro-Zionist and want to topple> regimes in the Middle East to help Israel as well as the US.” But he said he had been told by “a Congressional staffer” to be careful how heused the word neo-conservative because people might say he was being anti-Semitic. We have reached such an the outrageous stage in the destruction of freespeech that it is now ‘anti-Semitic’ to point out that the Bush administrationis carrying out a campaign of conquest that suits Israel perfectly whilecontrolled by people with fundamental loyalties to Israel. Professor EliotCohen, the close friend of his former college dean, Paul Wolfowitz, is on the USDefense Policy Board and involved with both the American Enterprise Instituteand the Project for the New American Century. He took the same old tired linewhen asked by Steve Bradshaw why he was concerned about the suggestion thatAmerican policy was all a conspiracy whipped up by a group of “neo-conservativehawks, who are somehow allied to Israel”. Cohen replied:> “Well sometimes the word neo-conservative is used when what they would really> like to say is Jews.” > “‘They’ being who?” > “People that use that kind of language and as a Jew I find that offensive.> There are two things that are despicable about it. The first the implication> of duel loyalty … and speaking as someone who’s father served in the United> States army, who served the United States army himself, who has a son in the> United States army, I find it deeply, deeply, offensive and untrue. And the> other thing I find deeply offensive about it is it contains anti-Semitic> cadre. Which is that the Jews, this scattered little people around the world,> have these occult powers and are pulling the strings of the naïve and duped> non-Jews. And it wasn’t that long ago that those kind of beliefs led to> hideous things that impinged upon me very directly. So yes, I feel very> strongly about it.” 97 I wonder if Arabs, the truly Semitic people, are deeply, deeply offended byCohen saying that the Third World War was against communism and the Fourth WorldWar is against “militant Islam?” 98 Can you imagine what Cohen would say if theneo-cons were called agents of “militant Zionism?” Or if the Israeli army thathas killed thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians was referred to as“Jewish terrorists”. No, no, that’s “anti-Semitic”. But what is the difference?Rabbi Yaacov Perrin was quoted in the New York Daily News as saying, “Onemillion Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.” 99 That is actuallyanti-Semitism against the truly Semitic people, the Arabs. If anyone said thatabout a person calling themselves Jewish they would be dubbed racist and, insome countries like Canada, arrested under ‘Hate Crime’ laws. Why is it racistto use the words Jewish or Israel, but not when you do the same with Arabs orIslam? Rabbi Ahron Cohen said in a statement for the orthodox Jewish,anti-Zionist, Neturei Karta group: “It must be clear that opposition to Zionismand its crimes does not imply hatred of Jews. On the contrary Zionism itself andits deeds are the biggest threat to Judaism.” 100 But as I write, Rick Santorum,the Republican Senator of Pennsylvania, has proposed a law that, in effect,prohibits the criticism of Israel on American college campuses by threateningthe universities with federal funding cuts if they allow students and staff topublicly criticise Israel.101 Santorum was the guy who supported the ‘SyrianAccountability Act’, which accuses Syria of backing ‘terrorism’ and developingweapons of mass destruction. In true Orwellian fashion, his plan to ban freedomof expression was called “ideological diversity” legislation while actuallyseeking to suppress such diversity. Criticism of Israel would be an act of“anti-Semitism” (impossible when Israel is controlled by people that are notSemitic!). The Kansas Senator, Sam Brownback, who is known as a staunch backerof Israel, called for a federal commission to be established under the HigherEducation Act to investigate any “anti-Semitic” incidents on US campuses.102Better watch criticism of Arab people, then, because they are the Semites.According to the New York Sun, the proposals followed a meeting attended by theIlluminati Anti-Defamation League exposed earlier by Israel Shamir.103 The ADLis the creation of B’nai B’rith that issued a statement in 1933 opposing anyboycott or exposure of the Nazi regime in Germany. Once again, can you imaginewhat would happen if it was proposed that criticism of Arab countries should bebanned from American campuses under the threat of stopping education funding?The same people proposing it with regard to Israel would be screaming andhurling abuse about anti-Semitism. What better example could there be of IsraelShamir’s point? To propose a ban on criticising Israel without demanding thesame for Arab countries and, indeed, every other, is sheer undiluted racism! Itis illusory racism, mind, when there is no such thing as a ‘Jewish race’.Israel’s apartheidThe extreme forms of Jewish or Ashkenazi belief, as outlined, for instance, inthe Babylonian Talmud, are stunningly racist and what can you say aboutstatements like this from Rafael Eitan, a Likud leader of the Tsomet faction:“The only good Arab is a dead Arab ... When we have settled the land, all theArabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like druggedcockroaches in a bottle.” 104 Of course, this is not the view of the people ingeneral, not at all. But this is the view of the extreme group that wasconnected to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and have controlled the State of Israelsince it was terrorised into existence in 1948 by Ashkenazi terror groups likeIrgun and the Stern Gang (also called Lehi) that produced later prime ministerssuch as Yitzhak Shamir and Menachem Begin. Shamir once wrote in Hazit, thejournal of Lehi:> “Neither Jewish morality nor Jewish tradition can be used to disallow terror> as a means of war ... We are very far from any moral hesitations when> concerned with the national struggle. First and foremost, terror is for us a> part of the political war appropriate for the circumstances of today.” 105 So it is more than a bit rich for these same people to issue theirholier-than-thou condemnations of terrorism and racism when Israel was createdthrough terrorism and is based on institutional racism written into the law ofthe land. ‘Jewish’ or Ashkenazi people can travel to Israel, declarecitizenship, and be granted all the privileges that are denied to Palestinianswho have lived in that land for thousands of years. Even the ‘Jewish’ populationis divided into levels of privilege decided by genetic origin. The whiteAshkenazim from Europe and America are by law at the top of the pyramid ofprivilege. Below them in Israel’s genetic caste system are the Sephardic Jews orMizrahim (the “Eastern Ones”), who came from Arab countries and do have anhistorical connection to the Middle East. Sephardic people are descended from‘Jews’ who were expelled from Spain in 1492. They lived in peace with the Arabsfor hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years before the Ashkenazi arrived innumbers from Europe in the mid-20th century under the banner of theRothschild-controlled political movement called Zionism. Rabbi Ahron Cohen saidin a statement for the anti-Zionist Neturei Karta group that the connectionbetween Muslims and Jews goes right back into ancient history. “Mostly therelationship was friendly and mutually beneficial”, he said, “Historically, thesituation frequently was that when Jews were being persecuted in Europe theyfound refuge in the various Muslim countries. Our attitude to Muslims and Arabscan only be one of friendliness and respect.” 106The Sephardic Jews were kept in corrugated iron transit camps where Ashkenaziofficials tried to strip them of their “Arabness” by replacing their“unpronounceable” Arab names with good ‘Jewish’ names. Most had to work ten totwelve hours a day in disease and squalor. Their high death rate was explainedby one Zionist official as a “common and natural thing”.107 Yemeni Jews inparticular faced extraordinary discrimination as they were transported, oftenagainst their wishes, from Yemen to Israel and held in primitive camps. Yemenibabies were stolen from their mothers and given for adoption to Ashkenazifamilies. Doctors, social workers and nurses worked together to kidnap 600Yemeni-Jewish babies, telling their parents they had died and giving them tochildless Ashkenazi couples. In the early 1990s, a high-profile campaign beganto try to reunite some of those shattered families. Professor Ella HabibaShohat, an Iraqi-Jewish Israeli who teaches at City University of New York inManhattan, has highlighted the suppression of Sephardic Jews in Israel. Her 1992book, Israeli Cinema: East/West and the Politics of Representation, shook theIsraeli establishment with its exposure of racism. She said of her upbringing inIsrael:> “It was taboo to speak Arabic in school and whenever teachers wanted to> chastise us, they would refer to us as ‘you Moroccan’ or ‘you Iraqi’ or ‘you> Yemeni’ … Jews from the Middle East were expected to abandon their Middle> Eastern traits, so we grew up without studying our history or culture. It was> all the more tragic for Palestinian Israelis, who couldn’t even read about> Arab history in textbooks.” 108 At the bottom of the genetic pile in the apartheid of ‘free, democratic’ Israel,come the black Jews from Ethiopia, who are treated appallingly. But even theyare placed by law above the Palestinians. Israel is a fundamentally racist statein which the Ashkenazim dominate and dictate to the Sephardic/Arab majority onthe basis of genetic origin. A report by the US organisation, Human RightsWatch, said: “There is no general prohibition of discrimination or guarantee ofequality in any of Israel’s Basic Laws. Indeed, equality was explicitly excludedfrom the Basic Law: Human Freedom and Dignity when it was drafted.” 109A personal storyJack Bernstein, an American Ashkenazi, moved to Israel from the United States,lured by the propaganda about the Jewish homeland. What he experienced sickenedhim and he detailed what he witnessed in an article entitled “The Life Of AnAmerican Jew In Racist-Marxist Israel”.110 He said that Zionist propaganda hasled the American people to believe that Zionism and Judaism are one and the sameand that they are religious in nature. This, he said, was a blatant lie.“Judaism is a religion; but Zionism is a political movement started mainly byEast European (Ashkenazi) Jews who for centuries have been the main force behindcommunism and socialism”, he writes. The ultimate goal of the Zionists, saidBernstein, is a one-world government under the control of the Zionists and theZionist-oriented International Bankers.111 He said that after the l967Arab-Israeli war Jews in America were filled with pride that “our homeland” hadbecome so powerful and successful. They had also been manipulated by falsepropaganda that Jews in America were being persecuted, he said. “So, betweenl967 and l970, approximately 50,000 American Jews fell for this Zionistpropaganda and migrated to Israel. I was one of those suckers”. Bernstein had noemotional conflict with leaving the United States because those callingthemselves Jews are allowed to have citizenship of both Israel and America,although this does not apply to any other Americans. Soon after arriving inIsrael, Bernstein fell in love with Ziva. She was a “Sephardic Jewess from Iraqwho, like myself, had fallen for the Zionist propaganda and had migrated toIsrael”. Jack and Ziva were married and that’s when he realised he was living ina racist state. He said that for the first three years of their marriage theyhad to live with Ziva’s aunt “because of the critical housing shortage in Israeland because of racism”. He said this was the genetic system used to allothousing:> 1)First choice goes to Ashkenazim who have lived in Israel for many years.> 2)Second in line are Ashkenazim from Europe, especially if they marry an> Israel-born Ashkenazi.> 3)Third are Ashkenazim from the United States, even better if they marry an> Israel-born Ashkenazi.> 4)Only after all of the above are housed do Sephardic Jews, with an historical> connection to this region, have a choice of whatever is left.> 5)At the bottom of the list come the Muslims, Druze and Christians.Jack Bernstein writes that even though he was an Ashkenazi from the UnitedStates, he was placed lower on the list for housing because he had married aSephardic Jewess. He said that employment opportunities were allocated in thesame way: the Ashkenazim get the best jobs; Sephardic Jews are next; whileMuslims, Druze and Christians filled the menial jobs with a great many leftunemployed. The Shas Party in Israel was specifically formed to address thediscrimination against Sephardic people by the Ashkenazi elite. Israel isfounded on outrageous racism of the most appalling and sinister nature. It is noless than apartheid and yet Ashkenazi organisations like the Anti-DefamationLeague go around hurling the label “racist” and “anti-Semite” at everyone else.Bernstein dismissed the very idea that Israel is either free or democratic. Itis, he said, a racist state:> “The Ashkenazi Jews, who migrated to Israel from Germany, while sympathetic to> communism and support it, tend to favor the practices of Nazi-style fascism.> During World War II in Germany these elite Zionist Ashkenazi Jews worked> closely with Hitler’s Gestapo in persecuting the lower class German Jews and> delivering them to concentration camps. Now living in Israel, these elite> Zionist Jews, who were well trained in Nazi-style fascism and favor it, have> imposed many facets of fascism on Israel. > “To give the impression that Israel is a democracy, members of the Knesset> (Israel’s Congress) are elected – but it’s an odd kind of election. This is> where Israel’s so-called democracy stops. It doesn’t make any difference which> party wins an election, the Likud or the Labor party, the elite Zionist Jews> rule in a dictatorial manner – giving favors to the elite clique and brutally> suppressing any dissent. > “Concerning Nazism/fascism, please let me clear a point. Germans are an> admirable people – I dare say even great. But in Germany, the general> population were victims of the Nazis who through cunning and brutality gained> power. In Germany, the average Jews were victims of the Zionist elite who> worked hand in hand with the Nazis. Many of those same Zionist Jews, who, in> Germany, had worked with the Nazis, came to Israel and joined hands with the> Zionist/communist Jews from Poland and Russia. It is the two faces of> communism and Nazi-style fascism that rule Israel. Democracy is merely an> illusion. > “Regarding the tie between the elite Ashkenazi Jews and the Nazis, take a look> at the word ‘Ashkenazi’ – look again – ‘AshkeNAZI,’ Interesting isn’t it?” 112 Norman Finklestein, in his book, Image And Reality Of The Israel-PalestineConflict, compares Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians to the apartheid ofSouth Africa and the view of the American settlers to native Americans. Asked ifIsrael was a democracy, he said:> “Was South Africa a democracy in the old days? It was a democracy for whites,> for the ‘superior people’. Similarly, Israel, for the larger part of its> history, has been a society where half the population has all the rights and> half the population has none.” 113 There can be no more blatant example of this in Israel than the ‘wall’, actuallypart-wall, part-fence, cutting off Israel from the Palestinian areas along a 150mile ‘border’ decided by the Israeli government. This has parted Palestinianfamilies, including fathers and mothers, from their wives, husbands andchildren, and destroyed the livelihoods of Palestinian farmers by putting theirland on the Israeli side of the wall. Qalqilya, once known as the West Bank’s“fruit basket”, is cut off on three sides from the farms which supply itsmarkets and the second-largest water sources in the region. Access to the40,000-inhabitant town consists of a single Israeli checkpoint. But don’t sayanything, it’s anti-Semitic.The many defamed by the fewThe terrible potential irony is that the manipulations of the neo-cons inAmerica on Israel’s behalf, and the actions of Israel, are going to be seen as a‘Jewish plot’ when the overwhelming majority of such people on this planet arevictims of the plot, not perpetrators of it. Indeed the Ashkenazi neo-cons andthose in control of Israel are not even Jewish. But all ‘Jewish’ people gettarred by the uninformed and the truly racist with the same label as themanipulating few. Washington journalist Jim Lobe, a long-standing opponent ofanti-Semitism and an investigator of the neo-cons since the 1970s, made thissame point:> “It’s no secret; the majority of neo-conservatives have been and remain> Jewish. That is a fact. They do not represent the view of a majority of the> American Jewish community.” He was asked if it was legitimate to talk about the pro-Israeli politics of somany neo-conservatives.> “Well, I think it’s very difficult to understand them if you don’t begin at> that point. I would think people would want to talk about that rather openly> because to the extent that you suppress it, I think then it festers.” 114 Well said Jim. But how can the Ashkenazim from what is now southern Russia, whoconverted to Judaism and have no genetic or historical connection to the land ofIsrael, really be regarded as ‘Jewish’ in the sense that they claim? How canthey be? Is a German or Russian who converts to the Church of England regardedas English? Of course not. The fact is that the American and Israeli governmentsare currently so close you can’t see the join, but you are a racist if you saythat this relationship is clearly not going to produce a policy that givesjustice to the Palestinians or other Arab nations. John Hamre, who runs theCenter for Strategic and International Studies, was only stating the obviouswhen he pointed out that, “We’re so close to Israel, so one-sided, that peoplein the Middle East don’t take us seriously”.115 A former US ambassador and WhiteHouse aide quoted in the UK Daily Telegraph said:> “One congressman, Jim Moran, said that if it weren’t for Israel, we wouldn’t> have been going to war, and he was accused of anti-Semitism. Because of the> atmosphere of war, deference to the President and the huge power of the> Israeli lobby, we didn’t even have a debate about whether we should go to war.> We simply jumped into it.” 116 Arthur Schlesinger, the former special assistant to President Kennedy, said theUnited States was totally dominant “except in the case of Israel – Israeldominates us”.117 People should be free to makes all these points because it ishighly relevant to what is happening in the Middle East and affects us all. Thisis not a Jewish plot for global control as some suggest. It is a conspiracy by afascist mind-set that can infest the consciousness of anyone no matter whattheir racial or ethnic background. There are white American, British andEuropean fascists; Arab fascists; black African fascists; Chinese fascists;Argentine fascists; and there are Ashkenazi fascists. If we are going to exposethe web that is daily entrapping more of our basic freedoms, we must refuse tohave that fact edited by those who use the smokescreen of ‘racism’ to stop theexposure of those involved in the global dictatorship. The Fourth Reich, or theovert re-emergence of the Third, is now imposing itself on our lives. It is timeto face up and grow up and stop seeing the world in the juvenile polarities ofblack and white, us and them, good guys and bad guys, good race and bad race,that programmes the reality of the political Left, Right and Centre. There areshades of grey and that’s where we need to look if we want to find out what isreally happening.SOURCES > 1 “Playing Skittles with Saddam”, The Guardian, September 3rd 2002> 2 Ibid> 3 Ibid> 4 Arthur Koestler, The Thirteenth Tribe: The Khazar Empire and Its Heritage> (Random House 1976)> 5 “Israel: A monument to anti-Semitism”, by Greg Felton, Media Monitors> Network, August 1st, 2001, http://www.mediamonitors.net/gregfelton2.html> [http://www.mediamonitors.net/gregfelton2.html]> 6 The Thirteenth Tribe, p 81> 7 Ibid, p 19> 8 Ibid, pp 21 to 22> 9 Dr Sandor Nagy, The Forgotten Cradle of the Hungarian Culture (Patria> Publishing Co.

The idea that the conquest of Iraq wasdecided in a matter of weeks because of the imminent danger to the world ofSaddam Hussein should insult the intelligence of a pea. It was part of a longplanned strategy for global conquest.In 2003 we had the Bush family in the White House, Dick Cheney as Vice Presidentand Colin Powell as Secretary of State, and a United States international‘coalition’ went to ‘war’ with Iraq. In 1991 the Bush family was in the WhiteHouse, Cheney was Defense Secretary and Powell was head of the US forces asChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a United States international‘coalition’ went to war with Iraq. If you add together the casualties from theinitial conflict, and the economic sanctions and bombing that followed, the ’91Gulf War cost the lives of a million Iraqi children, even without the childcasualties, immediate and long-term, of the invasion of 2003 and since. The GulfWar of father George Bush, like the latest one fronted by his idiot son, was acoldly manipulated set-up. The apparent cause was a dispute between Iraq andKuwait, a country that has been under British and Illuminati control back to thedays when the economic potential of oil was discovered. Iraq has one of theworld’s largest oil deposits and has attracted the constant attention of the USand British elite. In fact, countries like Kuwait, Iraq and others in the MiddleEast, were created by the British and their fellow European powers drawing linesin the sand. Kuwait is a dictatorship, an unpleasant one, and the idea that theGulf War was to ‘free’ Kuwait is just as ridiculous as the claim that the 2003invasion of Iraq was to ‘liberate’ the people. After the first Gulf conflictwhat happened? Saddam was left in power in Iraq and the Kuwaiti royaldictatorship was brought back with American and British support to continuetheir policy of the murder and torture of ‘dissidents’ who campaign for littleluxuries like freedom and a say in the running of their own country.Saddam Hussein, the designated villain of both conflicts, was in fact one of thegang. He was a member of the elite Safari Club, which began as a consortium alsoinvolving SAVAK, the CIA-connected secret police of the Shah of Iran; AnwarSadat, the later-assassinated President of Egypt; and Saudi ArabianIntelligence. It has been implicated in countless coups in Africa to further itsgoals and is heavily involved in arms trading and supply. Out of the Safari Clubcame the Pinay Circle, or Le Cercle, named after the French Prime Minister,Antoine Pinay. He was a major Illuminati asset who attended the first officialmeeting of the Bilderberg Group at Oosterbeek, Holland, in May 1954. Othersinvolved with Le Cercle included the Habsburg family, a major Illuminatibloodline. To give you an idea of its make-up and range of influence, the LeCercle membership has included Nicholas Elliot, a department head at Britain’sMI6; William Colby, a former director of the CIA; Colonel Botta of SwissMilitary Intelligence; Stefano Della Chiaie, a leading member of the ItalianSecret Service and Giulio Andreotti, Henry Kissinger’s friend, the formerItalian Prime Minister from the notorious P-2 Freemasonry lodge. No doubtneo-con Michael Ledeen knows him well; Silva Munoz, a former minister for thefascist Franco in Spain and a member of the elite secret society within theRoman Catholic network, Opus Dei; Franz Josef Strauss, the German DefenceMinister; and Monsignore Brunello, an agent to the Vatican. In America, one ofthe Le Cercle fronts is alleged to be the CIA-backed Heritage Foundation inWashington. Look at the potential for such an organisation to be a coordinatingforce between apparently different agencies and countries to achieve a commonaim. Le Cercle and the Safari Club are basically the same entity, which is why,as the Wall Street Journal reported on August 16th 1990, it was the CIA whosupported the Ba’ath Party in Iraq and orchestrated a coup that installed SaddamHussein as dictator in 1968, just as they did with Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. Butit is important to remember that everyone is expendable to the cause if theirsubsequent removal best serves the agenda.Bush – Saddam connectionsFather George Bush had more than political associations with Saddam Husseinbefore the 1991 Gulf conflict. Bush had considerable involvement with the Bankof Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), according to the Chicagojournalist, Sherman Skolnick, who made a detailed study of the bank. The BCCI,or the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International as it was rightly dubbed,crashed in 1991 amid an enormous scandal that cost its customers multi-billions.One of the controllers of the bank was Khalid bin Mahfouz. He was named by theClinton State Department as a funder of Osama bin Laden and he was also aninvestor in Harken Energy, one of boy George Bush’s oil companies (see Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). James Bath, a close friend ofGeorge W. Bush for decades, was the Texas representative of Bin Mahfouz. Thepurpose of the BCCI was to wash drug money and provide a channel for the fundingby government agencies like the CIA of the terrorist groups that are used toserve the agenda. Sherman Skolnick has claimed publicly, including an interviewon Radio Free America, that father Bush, Saddam Hussein and others, used theBCCI to split $250 billion in oil ‘kick backs’, the skimming-off of money paidby western oil companies in the Gulf. Other researchers and insiders have saidthe same. Skolnick claims that the records implicating Bush in deals with Saddamand former Panama President Manuel Noriega were in the hands of the Bank ofEngland and that the money was channelled through the BCCI and Banca Nazionaledel Lavoro (BNL) branches in the USA. Henry Gonzales, the chairman of the HouseBanking Committee, identified links between the BCCI and BNL. Skolnick toldinterviewer Tom Valentine on Radio Free America:> “[The BCCI] … was formed in the 1970s with seed money from the Bank of> America, the largest shareholders of which are the Rothschilds of Chicago,> Paris, London and Switzerland …The bank is also linked to the financial> affairs of former President Jimmy Carter and his friend, and one-time budget> director, banker Bert Lance. > “Some of the … Democrats who have been involved in this whole affair have been> published, for example, in the May 3rd issue of the Wall Street Journal.> During the 1988 presidential campaign, additionally, BCCI was one of the major> financiers of the Michael Dukakis campaign … BCCI financed the Democratic> Party in the United States and arranged deals for Republicans outside the> United States.”1 Skolnick said records detailing the alleged Bush-Saddam deals were held in theChicago branch of the BCCI, which was seized by the Federal government in 1988.He went on:> “The same bank has records showing joint business ventures between General> Manuel Noriega, former dictator of Panama, and George Bush. In January of> 1990, the Federal prosecutor in Tampa had former top officials of Florida’s> branch on trial. They were allowed to escape prison with only a slap on the> wrist and a small penalty. Here’s why: they told the Justice Department that> if they were going to prison, they had documents from their bank showing that> George Bush had private business ventures through their bank with a series of> dictators including not only Saddam and Noriega, but others as well … > “… Saddam’s oil was shipped to Texas. In 1985 a Texas jury, at the behest of> Pennzoil, issued the largest damages verdict in American history against> Texaco. Pennzoil claimed that Texaco damaged them in a deal with Getty Oil.> Who owns Pennzoil? [Father] George Bush and his friends … as a result, Texaco> fell under the domination and supervision of Pennzoil. Where did the kickbacks> to Saddam reportedly come from? They came from deals between Texaco and its> subsidiaries purchasing oil from Iraq.”2 Who supplied Saddam’s chemical weapons? The USA – didn’t they Donald?One of the loudest voices calling for the 2003 invasion of Iraq was the DefenseSecretary, Donald Rumsfeld, a man whose inability to tell the truth never ceasesto stagger. Yet this same Rumsfeld was sent to meet Saddam Hussein by theReagan- Bush White House in 1983 to arrange for the supply of chemical andbiological weapons to Iraq for the war against Iran, which Iraq started in 1980and continued for eight devastating years. These US-supplied ‘weapons’ includedanthrax and bubonic plague cultures. Conspiracy theory? No, no, this informationis contained in declassified US State Department documents that came to light inlate 2002. Rumsfeld’s meeting with Saddam, preceded by a warm handshake, waspart of the Reagan-Bush (in other words Bush) policy of close cooperation withthe Iraqi dictator. The documents reveal that the United States increased armssupplies to Saddam even after he had used US-supplied poison gas against theKurds in 1987 and 1988.3 President Boy George Bush and Tony Blair constantlyrepeated in ‘justifying’ the 2003 invasion of Iraq that Saddam had used chemicalweapons “against his own people” when, in truth, the US and Britain had suppliedthe means to do it. This US support for Saddam continued for seven years andonly a week before Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the US ambassador to Baghdadassured him that the then President father George Bush “wanted better and deeperrelations”.An investigation in 1994 by the Senate Banking Committee disclosed that dozensof biological agents were shipped to Iraq in the mid-1980s under licence fromthe US Commerce Department. These included strains of anthrax that Rumsfeld,Bush and Powell cited in 2003 as one of the reasons they must invade Iraq. Amonth before Rumsfeld’s visit to Baghdad, George (Illuminati) Shultz, theSecretary of State, was given intelligence reports showing that Iraqi troopswere resorting to “almost daily use of CW (chemical weapons) against theIranians”.4 Rumsfeld claimed he had “cautioned” Saddam about the use of chemicalweapons at the 1983 meeting. So why supply them in the first place? Once againRumsfeld is lying. Of course he is; he’s speaking isn’t he? When Rumsfeld’s liewas contradicted by the declassified State Department note of his meeting withSaddam, a Pentagon spokesman said that Mr Rumsfeld issued the caution to TariqAziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister. If you are caught out on one lie, what do youdo? You tell another. Howard Teicher, a former National Security Councilofficial during the Reagan Administration, said in a sworn affidavit that theUnited States “actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the Iraqiswith billions of dollars of credits, by providing military intelligence andadvice to the Iraqis, and by closely monitoring third-country arms sales to Iraqto make sure Iraq had the military weaponry required”.5 Teicher said thatWilliam Casey, the former CIA Director, supplied Saddam with cluster bombsthrough a front company in Chile.Who supplied North Korea with nuclear technology? Donald Rumsfeld’s companyBut while we are on the subject of Rumsfeld, there’s more. In the year 2000, hewas a director of the European engineering giant ABB when it sold nuclearreactors to North Korea in a deal worth $200 million and this was the samenuclear capability cited by Rumsfeld, Bush and Co in 2002 as proof that NorthKorea was part of an “axis of evil” that had to be confronted.6 Rumsfeld was onthe ABB board for eleven years until he left to join the Bush administration in2001. At the time of the nuclear deal ABB’s then chief executive, Goran Lindahl,announced a “wide-ranging, long-term cooperation agreement” with the communistgovernment. The type of reactors involved produce plutonium that needs refiningbefore it can be weaponised. One US congressman and critic of the North Koreanregime described the reactors as “nuclear bomb factories”.7 When questionedabout this outrageous hypocrisy, Rumsfeld’s office said that the defensesecretary did not “recall it being brought before the board at any time”.8 Stillmore diplomatic amnesia. Sorry, lying. A spokesman for ABB said that all boardmembers were informed about the deal.It is worth emphasising this again: These liars and cheats are the very samepeople who have told you what happened on September 11th, who did it, and how.Father Bush funded SaddamThe public were also not told that it was the Bush government that had fundedthe very Saddam military that father George sent US troops to fight in 1991.Much of the funding was channelled through a branch of Italy’s Banca Nazionaledel Lavoro (BNL) in Atlanta. Congressman Henry Gonzales exposed the BNL scandalin 1991 after he noticed that this little branch of the Italian government bankhad loaned Iraq $5 billion. This money was dispatched to Saddam after November1989 when the Bush White House guaranteed bank loans to Iraq if they were to beused for the purchase for US farm products. If Saddam defaulted, the UStaxpayers picked up the tab for the loan and, since he was always defaulting,that was obviously going to be the outcome from the start. As planned, Saddamspent the money on arms, including purchases from the Matrix Churchill machinetool company in England. This company was the subject of a court case in whichthe British government was implicated. Although many US investigators warnedBush that the money was being used for arms, the loans were allowed to continue.The aim was obvious when you look at the other evidence. Bush was doing the sameas his father did with Hitler. He was funding an aggressor so he could start awar with him. Some of the money was spent on buying poison gas from a CIA frontcalled Cardeon Industries in Chile.9 When the war started, Saddam defaulted onthe loans and the US taxpayers footed the bill for Iraq to fight their own sonsand daughters. The cover-up of this, as usual, led to the targeting of the smallfry. The whole thing was blamed on the bank manager at the BNL’s Atlanta branch,Christopher P. Drogoul, who could never have sanctioned that sort of moneywithout the highest authorisation.A guy called Peter Kawaja said in an American radio interview that he wasinvolved at one time with Product Ingredient Technology in Boca Raton, Florida,and with Ishan Barbouti International (IBI), the builder of Pharma 150, thechemical and biological weapons complex in Rabta, Libya.10 His experiences ledhim to investigate what was going on. He said he went to the CIA and FBI andoperated for the US government under a code name because they told him thesepeople were international terrorists and that they were going to prosecute them.Kawaja said that he did his own investigation, however, which included “buggingtelephone lines, buildings, and certain other locations throughout the UnitedStates”. He said he intercepted communications to the Commodity CreditCorporation and the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Kawaja said he saw theletters of credit of the BNL, which came from Switzerland, and “a lot of othercommunications regarding the Gulf War that was to come”. He said he recordedcalls going to and coming from Baghdad, to and from the United States andLondon, CIA, FBI, FBI counter-intelligence, US Customs, certain politicians andnumerous other individuals. “This is my information”, he said in the radiointerview. “It is not second-hand.” US District Judge Marvin Shoob said theclaim that the Atlanta branch of the BNL could loan $5 billion to Iraq withoutthe approval of the head office in Rome could only come out of “never-neverland”. The judge said of manager Drogoul and four other employees at the branch:> “… [They] were pawns or bit players in a far larger and wider ranging> sophisticated conspiracy that involved BNL-Rome and possibly large American> and foreign corporations and the governments of the United States, England,> Italy and Iraq … smoke is coming out of every window. I have to conclude that> the building is on fire.” 11 This is the last thing the father Bush administration and the Illuminati wantedto hear. Judge Shoob was removed from the case and replaced by Judge ErnestTidwell, who refused to allow any evidence to be presented about the CIA and theBush-White House involvement in the bank. Drogoul was persuaded to plead guiltyeven though he wasn’t. The funding of the Iraqi arms build-up before the GulfWar and the supplying of weapons involved the Bush administration, the Britishgovernment, the Italian government, the Soviet Union and other leadinggovernments and corporations controlled by the Illuminati. One of the network ofIlluminati private ‘armies’ is called the Wackenhut Corporation andinvestigative journalist John Connolly exposed in a Spy Magazine article12 thatWackenhut had been involved in the arming of Iraq before the first Gulf War bytransporting the means to produce the very chemical weapons that father GeorgeBush and Co were saying posed such a threat to the world. George Wackenhut, aformer FBI operative, started the company with other FBI associates in 1954 andits board has been packed over the years with recruits from the FBI, CIA and themilitary. It has since merged with Group 4 Falck, the world’s second largestprovider of Security Services. George Wackenhut is a long-time friend of fatherGeorge Bush and has contributed generously to his political campaigns and thoseof boy George and Florida governor Jeb Bush. Journalist John Connolly wrote:> “… After a six-month investigation, in the course of which we spoke to more> than 300 people, we believe we know that the [Wackenhut] truck did contain> equipment necessary for the manufacture of chemical weapons and where it was> headed [in the Winter of 1990]: to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. And the Wackenhut> Corporation – a publicly traded company with strong ties to the CIA and> federal contracts worth $200 million a year – was making sure Saddam would be> getting his equipment intact.” 13 The supply of weapons and money involved another familiar name, Henry Kissinger,the former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor to Richard Nixon atthe time of the Watergate scandal and a genocidal maniac who is now threatenedwith arrest in several countries for war crimes. As early as 1984 his companyKissinger Associates was arranging for loans from the BNL to Iraq to finance itsarms purchases from a little-known subsidiary of Fiat, which was headed by majorIlluminati initiate Giovanni Agnelli. Charles Barletta, a former JusticeDepartment investigator, was quoted about this in the US Spotlight newspaper onNovember 9th 1992. The report said:> “Barletta added that Federal probers had collected dozens of such> incriminating case histories about the Kissinger firm. But Henry Kissinger> seems to possess a kind of immunity. I’m not sure how he does it, but> Kissinger wields as much power over the Washington National Security> bureaucracy now as in the days when he was the Nixon administration’s foreign> policy czar. He gets the pay-off; others get the blame. Kissinger will remain> unscathed until Congress finds the courage to convene a full-dress> investigation into this Teflon power broker.” “We love you Sad, go get ’em, boy”Saddam Hussein was encouraged by the American and British governments to go towar with the CIA/British intelligence-imposed regime of the Ayatollah Khomeiniin Iran in 1980. The war dragged on for eight years amid appalling suffering andloss of life. But it was good for the oil, banking and armament cartel (allcontrolled by the Illuminati) and for divide and rule. In 1990-91 Saddam wouldbe used again, knowingly or otherwise, to start another war in the Gulf, anotherconflict planned long before. Author and researcher George C. Andrews reported:> “A little known fact about the Gulf War is that one month before our> Declaration of War on December 15, 1990, Secretary of State James Baker,> signed the US Army Report from the 352nd Civil Affairs Command on the New> Kuwait [unclassified, and therefore available to those interested]. This> report describes in detail how extensively Kuwait will be destroyed, how the> oil wells will be set on fire, and then how it will all be rebuilt ‘better> than before’, with despotism, instead of democracy, even more entrenched than> it had been before. The report includes a list of US corporations who will be> assigned the profitable task of rebuilding Kuwait and extinguishing the oil> fires, as well as the Arab names they will be operating under. [Exactly the> same was done before the ‘war’ in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.] > “Why have none of his political opponents thought of asking the obvious> questions … [such as] … Why are the huge business deals between Bush and> Hussein still off-limits to the public’s right to know?” 14 To readers of my books, the answers to these questions will be obvious.The stingOn July 25th 1990, Saddam Hussein met with the US ambassador in Baghdad, AprilGlaspie, who told him she was acting on the instructions of President Bush. Shesaid the Bush government had “no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflict like yourborder disagreement with Kuwait”. Glaspie added that she had instructions fromthe President to seek better relations with Iraq. She then left for a summerholiday, another indication to Saddam that the Americans were not interested inhis plan to invade Kuwait.15 Timing is everything to the Illuminati. They have aspecific agenda with a specific timescale. As former Blair cabinet ministerClare Short has said, the date of the second invasion of Iraq was known longbefore it happened and events were manipulated to hit the deadline. This was thereason for the weapons inspectors of Hans Blix being denied the time to completetheir inspections. It was the same in 1991. Suddenly father Bush changed hisstance and labelled Saddam “the new Hitler”. He said the Second World War hadshown that appeasement of such people was not the answer. He might have addedthat it is also not the answer to fund both sides in a conflict and to helpfinance Hitler’s war machine, as his father had done. For those who knew thegame plan, it was easy to see what was happening. Bush announced on November 8th1990 that the forces in Saudi Arabia would be substantially increased. The‘defensive’ force was now to switch to offensive mode and the Bush ‘UN forces’attacked on Wednesday, January 16th 1991, as planned all along. 120,000 airsorties were unleashed on Iraq, mostly, it turned out, against civilian areas.Bush’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, who has ancestrallinks with many old American and British families, headed the operation. Thenumber of dead and injured from the bombing of Iraq, the resulting disease andthe economic sanctions can hardly be comprehended. Conditions for the civiliansin Iraq were unimaginable under the economic stranglehold that was imposedthrough the United Nations by America and Britain after the Gulf War.Home of the brave …The ‘wars’ against Iraq, as with Afghanistan, cannot truly be described as warsat all. My understanding of a ‘war’ is that you need two sides and under thatdefinition the Gulf War was not a ‘war’. American soldiers have described it asa “turkey shoot”, which is precisely what it was. The Iraqi army, mainlyconscripts who had no choice, may have been armed by the US and Britain, but notwith the level of firepower that they have. Iraqi men, women and children weresubjected to the most intense bombing blitz in human history. At least tens ofthousands died in the bombardment and while the media were showing us picturesprovided by the US military of ‘smart bombs’ that could target a building and gothrough a toilet window, the truth that was being suppressed daily by themilitary censors was very different. At least 93% of the bombs that rained fromthe Iraqi skies were not ‘smart’ and that’s according to the Pentagon’s ownnumbers, and 70% of them missed their target. Other civilian targets were struckunder the guise of being military or weapon-making centres. A civilian bombshelter was hit because “intelligence told us it was a military headquarters”.Reporter Peter Arnett, then with CNN, visited the civilian bomb shelter in Iraqand found it was ... a bomb shelter. He also visited a milk factory bombedbecause it was a “chemical weapons factory” and found it was … a milk factory.In fact he had been there a year before and it was producing … milk. Mistakes?Please. Look again at how the Airman magazine described the capabilities of theGlobal Hawk unmanned surveillance plane deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq:> “On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval> Weapons Center at China Lake, California. The images it gathered were so clear> that an electro-optical image stands out next to an F/A-18 fighter. An> infrared image showed where concrete had cooled down from the shadow of a> C-130 that had recently taken off.” 16 There are no mistakes about locations when you have that level of surveillancetechnology. Thousands of Iraqi soldiers were buried alive in 1991 as ‘UN’ forcesused bulldozers to fill in their trenches in blatant contravention ofinternational law. But nothing encapsulates the mentality of these deeply sickpeople currently waging the ‘war on terrorism’ better than the almostunimaginable attacks on the “Highway of Death”. The Iraqi army was in retreat inthe wake of the air bombardment and headed out of Kuwait across the border toBasra. With them were civilians and prisoners. US pilots attacked the vehiclesat the front and back of the seven-mile retreating human convoy, so forcing itto a standstill on the open road. They then systematically bombed the convoy,constantly racing back to their aircraft carrier to re-arm and return tocontinue the mass murder. As one pilot said, it was like “shooting fish in abarrel” and thousands died at the hands of the very people who now ‘fightterrorism’ and promote themselves as morally superior to those they target.Barry McCaffrey, one of the generals involved in this mass murder, was laterappointed by President Clinton to head his ‘War on Drugs’. Yet, as he conductedthese crimes against humanity, father George Bush’s approval ratings soared,just as they did, at first, for his son when he continued the long, long, familyassociation with human genocide. The blatant defiance of the Geneva Conventionon the Highway of Death produced no action against the Bush administrationbecause there is one law for America, Britain and other ‘Western’ andEnglish-speaking nations, and a very different one for those they choose tobomb, kill and mutilate. An International War Crimes Tribunal found PresidentGeorge Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Secretaryof State James Baker and military leaders Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf,guilty of war crimes. But what was done as a result? Nothing. These are thepeople who have the audacity to put others on trial for war crimes, like theformer Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.Dark knightsThe Illuminati Queen of England was most grateful to these maniacs, however, andshe made Bush’s military chiefs Colin Powell and “Stormin’” Norman Schwarzkopf,(the commander of Operation Desert Storm), Honorary Knights of the BritishEmpire. Schwarzkopf has lied through his teeth about the ‘mystery’ disease knownas Gulf War Syndrome that has afflicted veterans of that slaughter. His fatherwould have been proud of him. Norman Schwarzkopf senior had been an importantplayer in the British-American Intelligence coup called Operation AJAX, whichremoved the Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953. The Illuminatiwanted him ousted after he nationalised oil production and removed the oilcartel’s power over his people. The British bloodline Prime Minister, WinstonChurchill, was also behind the coup. Mossadegh was replaced by the dictatorshipof the Shah of Iran who reversed the oil nationalisation (see And The TruthShall Set You Free). It is rare for the Queen to give Honorary Knighthoods andother honours to people outside the Commonwealth, but those she has chosen readlike an Illuminati Who’s Who. The titles are dubbed “honorary” because theAmerican Constitution forbids the acceptance of titles from the monarch of aforeign state without the permission of Congress. So few of these honours aregiven because, as a British government official put it: “One must not debase thecurrency.” I wonder if you think the following names debase the currency: GeorgeBush, the paedophile, child killer, mass murderer, Satanist and close friend ofthe Windsors, was made an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath,as was Ronald Reagan, Bush’s lapdog ‘President’; Henry Kissinger, theorchestrator of genocide on a monumental scale worldwide, was made KnightCommander of the Order of St Michael and St George at a ceremony at WindsorCastle; Brent Scowcroft, an executive of Kissinger Associates and top adviser toGeorge Bush, was made an Honorary Knight of the British Empire; and CasperWeinberger, another Bush clone who was charged with offences in the Iran-Contraarms scandal and pardoned by Bush, is another Honorary Knight of the BritishEmpire. After the September 11th atrocities, the insider mayor of New York,Rudolph Giuliani, was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the MostExcellent Order of the British Empire for doing nothing more than the job he waspaid handsomely to do. So why was he such a chosen one? For some more realisticbackground to ‘hero’ Giuliani and his activities see the website of RobertLederman, a street artist in New York and a regular columnist for the GreenwichVillage Gazette.17Burying the truthThe crimes for which the Bush family and their masters and associates areresponsible rarely come to light because the media, at the top level, iscontrolled by the Illuminati and most journalists either don’t realise they arepawns in a game or they accept it to protect their careers. The accounts arelegion of how evidence and footage that expose the lies, especially in wartime,are banned or confiscated. One example during the 1991 Gulf Slaughter was whenthe American TV networks NBC and CBS refused to air pictures shot in Iraq of thedestruction of civilian areas that revealed the Bush government and militaryaccounts to be a grotesque fiction – just as they are in the ‘war on terrorism’.The story was blocked by the President of NBC Michael Gartner and the producersoffered it to CBS, where Tom Bettag, the Executive Editor of the CBS EveningNews, said one of them would appear on the show the following day to tell theirstory. That evening Bettag was sacked and the story buried. This is the realbackground to the TV news.18Footage of the Highway of Death was also suppressed. Father Bush’s lies aboutIraqi troop deployments in Kuwait, provable by satellite images, were also nevershown. This satellite ‘loophole in the lies’ was the reason why the USgovernment purchased all rights to satellite pictures of Afghanistan while thatcountry was subjected to another insane American and British bombing onslaught.We should note, of course, that having said that the CIA-installed dictatorSaddam Hussein was a threat to the world, and with the Iraqi ‘army’ destroyed,father George Bush suddenly called an end to the ‘war’ and pulled the troops outleaving Saddam still intact. As Norman Schwarzkopf said with an air ofdisappointment: “We could have completely closed the door and made it a battleof annihilation … [it was] literally about to become the battle of Cannae, abattle of annihilation.” Ah, never mind Norman, but you see your president andthose who controlled him wanted Hussein to stay put, or at least appear to, sothey could play that card again more than a decade later.Bombing is not enough …The public believe the Gulf War ended in 1991, but in fact it was onlybeginning. Using the ‘threat’ of Saddam, the ‘threat’ Bush chose not to removewhen it was there for the taking, the United States and the United Kingdom, thediabolical duo of world terrorism, led a campaign of ‘sanctions’ against Iraq.They also continued, unreported, the bombing of civilian targets, a policymaintained by the Clinton and boy George Bush administrations. Investigativejournalist John Pilger wrote of a woman he met in northern Iraq who had lost herhusband, children and father-in-law when they were bombed by two US planes whiletending their sheep on open land.19 The sanctions against a country that imports70% of its food were imposed on a people already devastated by the mass bombingof their electricity, water supply, transport and sewer systems, which theBritish and American governments refused to allow them to rebuild. A publichealth team from Harvard University went into Iraq soon after the officialbombing and estimated that over 46,000 children under the age of five hadalready died by August 1991 because of the destruction of Iraq’sinfrastructure.20 But the nightmare was only beginning. Writer Thomas J. Nagyexposed the coldly calculated way the US military targeted the Iraqi watersupply in the full knowledge of the gruesome effect this would have on thepeople, especially children. In an article headed “The Secret Behind theSanctions: How the US Intentionally Destroyed Iraq’s Water Supply”, he wrotethat “the United States knew the cost that civilian Iraqis, mostly children,would pay, and it went ahead anyway.”21 Nagy, who lectures at the School ofBusiness and Public Management at George Washington University, uncovereddocuments from the US Defense Intelligence Agency that reveal a stunningdisregard for human life. A document dated January 22nd 1991 says:> “Iraq depends on importing specialized equipment and some chemicals to purify> its water supply … Failing to secure supplies will result in a shortage of> pure drinking water for much of the population. This could lead to increased> incidences, if not epidemics, of disease … [the] most likely diseases during> [the] next 60-90 days [include]: diarrhoeal diseases (particularly children);> acute respiratory illnesses (colds and influenza); typhoid; hepatitis A> (particularly children); measles, diphtheria and pertussis (particularly> children); meningitis, including meningococcal (particularly children);> cholera (possible, but less likely).” 22 This is a massive violation of the Geneva Convention, which says:> “It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects> indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs,> crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation> works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to> the civilian population or to the adverse party, whatever the motive.” The US/British-led UN sanctions against Iraq have done all of these things. By1995 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was forced to admit on the SixtyMinutes television programme that these sanctions had already cost the lives ofhalf a million Iraqi children and that was only up to then. Albright said onSixty Minutes that she thought the consequences for those children were worth itto stop Saddam. That is stunning enough, but, of course, by invading Iraq asecond time in 2003 they were saying that the sanctions and all that death andsuffering was for nothing. This is the mentality that controls our world. Areport by Richard Garfield of Columbia University concluded that the increase inchild death rates in Iraq was virtually unique in modern health studies.23 DenisHalliday, coordinator of the so-called ‘Oil-for-Food Programme’ resigned inSeptember 1998 and spoke out against the genocidal effects of the sanctions. Hissuccessor, Hans von Sponeck, did the same in February 2000. The US governmentresponse was to try to discredit the two men. The ‘oil for food’ farce providedthe oil cartel with cheap Iraqi oil. Forty per cent of Iraq’s oil, exchanged tobuy food, ended up in the United States at knock-down prices because of thesanctions imposed by the United States and Britain to the immense benefit of theIlluminati oil cartel.The forces of freedom and liberty have also been bombing Iraq with weaponscontaining spent uranium and this has led to the birth of babies with horribledeformities and disease (Figures 8 and 9). Since this bombardment began in 1991,Iraq has developed the world’s highest rate of childhood leukaemia. At the sametime there was an embargo on medicines and technology that would help to reducethe radiation. The genocidal attacks on the Iraqi population began with‘Republican’ father George Bush, continued with ‘Democrat’ Bill Clinton, andwithin a month of taking office at the start of 2001, George W. Bush, another‘Republican’, was ordering (being told to order) more “routine” bombing of Iraq.In truth they are just lackeys for the same one-party state and that’s why thepolicies never change no matter who is in the White House.Image [../Images/00013.jpg]Image [../Images/00014.jpg]Figures 8 and 9: These are just two of the victims of the depleted uraniumdropped on Iraq in 1991. Even more of this poison has been left by the slaughterof 2003 Don’t do as I do …The sanctions were ‘justified’ in part because of the ‘weapons of massdestruction’, including biological weapons, claimed to be stockpiled by SaddamHussein in 2003. But the Iraqi arsenal was funded and supplied by the US andBritish governments and their allies, and the biggest owner of weapons of massdestruction on the planet is the US government. What’s more, by far the greatestuser of them is … the US government. Only one nation has dropped nuclear weaponson another country at the time of writing … the United States. Add to that thevoting record of the United States at the United Nations where it hasconsistently opposed resolutions to limit the production and testing ofbiological and nuclear weapons, as it has on a stream of humanitarian andfreedom issues. While the US government was lying about the threat to the worldfrom Saddam’s chemical weapons, in one location alone in the United States,Anniston, Alabama, were 873,020 pounds of sarin, 1,657,480 pounds of VX nerveagent and 1,976,760 pounds of mustard agent.24 Across America the military isstoring 23,415 tons of liquid sarin nerve agent, blister-causing mustard agent,a deadly nerve liquid called VX and variants – 46,830,000 pounds of chemicals.25A teaspoon is enough to kill or maim. The United States is required byinternational treaty to destroy all chemical weapons by 2007, but nearly 75 percent of the nation’s now-banned arms still exist. The moralising of the UnitedStates government and the brain-dead people who support the continuing death anddestruction is sickening beyond measure. The US is the only country to havebombed more than 20 countries since 1945; the only country to use nuclearweapons; it withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in December2001; refused to support efforts to create a verification process for theBiological Weapons Convention and brought an international conference on thematter to a halt in July 2001; refused to ratify the UN Convention on the Rightsof the Child; it is the only Western country to allow the death penalty forchildren; it refused to sign the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, forbidding the use oflandmines; and joined Israel in opposing a 1987 General Assembly resolutioncondemning international terrorism.26Amnesty International said in 1996:> “Throughout the world, on any given day, a man, woman or child is likely to be> displaced, tortured, killed or ‘disappeared’, at the hands of governments or> armed political groups. More often than not, the United States shares the> blame.” 27 British leaders, too, have an appalling record of mass murder. As far back as1919, when Winston Churchill was Secretary of State at the War Office, they wereusing chemical weapons against Iraq. When poison gas was used to put down anIraqi rebellion against colonial rule, Churchill said: “I do not understand thissqueamishness about the use of gas. I am strongly in favour of using [it]against uncivilised tribes.” 28 A soldier who fought with the British army inthe Gulf War of 1991 told me that chemical weapons were used against the Iraqitroops in that conflict. Robert Cooper, a former diplomat and personal assistantfor foreign affairs to British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, admitted in ThePost-Modern State and the World Order: “We need to get used to the idea ofdouble standards … [in other words] … get over it, we are hypocrites (butpowerful ones).” Cooper said that the 1991 conflict with Iraq was to maintaincontrol of oil supplies and “… the reasons for fighting the Gulf War were notthat Iraq had violated the norms of international behaviour …” Exactly. Theyjust use any excuse to sell a lie to the people to introduce their agenda – asthey have with September 11th and the second ‘war’ with Iraq.Weapons of mass deceptionIt was long planned, as these things are, that ‘weapons of mass destruction’ wasto be the excuse for the second war against Iraq in 2003. Having suppliedSaddam’s chemical and biological arsenal they were not going to let himnegotiate it away or acknowledge it was no longer there. Even so, Scott Ritter,former head of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, made it clear that by the late1990s Saddam’s regime was no threat. Ritter said in the June 2000 edition ofArms Control Today:> “Given the comprehensive nature of the monitoring regime put in place by> UNSCOM, which included a strict export-import control regime, it was possible> as early as 1997 to determine that, from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq had> been disarmed. Iraq no longer possessed any meaningful quantities of chemical> or biological agent, if it possessed any at all, and the industrial means to> produce these agents had either been eliminated or were subject to stringent> monitoring. The same was true of Iraq’s nuclear and ballistic missile> capabilities. > “… By the end of 1998, Iraq had, in fact, been disarmed to a level> unprecedented in modern history, but UNSCOM and the Security Council were> unable – and in some instances unwilling – to acknowledge this> accomplishment.” They were unwilling because it would have destroyed the cover story necessary tocontinue the mass killing and ‘sell’ the planned invasion of 2003. Theconsequences for the people of Iraq of the 1991 war and the sanctions thatfollowed were beyond comprehension. The country was already in a desperate stateeven before the US and British blitzkrieg was visited upon them for the secondtime. Arundhati Roy wrote in the UK Guardian:> “After using the ‘good offices’ of UN diplomacy (economic sanctions and> weapons inspections) to ensure that Iraq was brought to its knees, its people> starved, half a million of its children killed, its infrastructure severely> damaged, after making sure that most of its weapons have been destroyed, in an> act of cowardice that must surely be unrivalled in history, the> ‘Allies’/’Coalition of the Willing’ (better known as the Coalition of the> Bullied and Bought) – sent in an invading army! > “Operation Iraqi Freedom?

It wasback to Iraq or back again to their ancient headquarters in the land of Sumerand Babylon (Figure 10, overleaf).Boy George Bush was given the speech to read (as best he can) for the State ofthe Union (it’s shit) address on January 28th 2002. This contained the phrase,the “axis of evil”, written by neo-con David Frum of the American EnterpriseInstitute. It referred to Iraq, Iran and North Korea, three countriesspecifically named in the September 2000 document produced for Cheney, Rumsfeld,Wolfowitz and Co by the Project for the New American Century. First on the listwas Iraq and the lies began to flood from the White House, the Pentagon andDowning Street in an effort to sell an invasion to the public. They had tojustify the war with spurious claims about ‘weapons of mass destruction’ andalso portray the ‘victory’ as the liberation of grateful Iraqis, freed byAmerican heroes. This was important because the better the spin in Iraq theeasier the next invasion would be to deliver. In this endeavour they weresupported magnificently by the American television networks.Image [../Images/00015.jpg]Figure 10: Returning home: the Babylonian Empire in the very land now targetedby the Illuminati and their ‘neo-cons’ I was watching CNN in America on the day the statue of Saddam Hussein wasfamously pulled to the ground by US troops amid crowds of cheering Iraqis inBaghdad. Or, at least, that is what they told me I was seeing. CNN stayed liveon the statue for some two hours waiting for this event to take place in thesquare right in front of the Palestine Hotel, which just happened to be home tothe international journalists and TV crews. It was all a set up. The TV picturesfocussed on the close-up of the statue and the cheering people, but a wide shotrevealed that only a handful of Iraqis were there and the rest of the square wasempty (Figures 11 and 12). Many of these “cheering Iraqis” were connected to theCIA-funded Iraqi National Congress of Ahmed Chalabi, who was the USpuppet-of-choice to ‘lead’ occupied Iraq. The whole event was carefully plannedand stage-managed to provide a defining moment of the ‘war’ in the minds of themasses: Iraq had been liberated from oppression by the glorious United States(played by John Wayne). Dr Susan Block, an author and sex educator, compared thescene to a rape:> “The supreme victory for the rapist is proof that his victim ‘enjoyed’ it.> Though he may force his way into her property, demolish her home, murder her> loved ones, pillage her belongings, though he may terrify and humiliate her,> beat and batter her, break her bones and tear her flesh, spill her blood,> wound her organs and lay waste to her very soul, if, in the midst of the rape,> between tears and shrieks of agony, if his victim should, for a moment, for> some reason, any reason, if she should smile, or, better yet, orgasm, the> rapist is redeemed; he is even (in his mind) heroic … > “… And still the cozily embedded mainstream media keep playing the image of> the toppling statue and the smiling Iraqis. CNN might as well be anchored by> Ari Fleischer [the White House press spokesman]. The jacked-up newscasters> revel in the soft-core porn of war, ‘tastefully’ showing very little of the> rampant hardcore death and dismemberment, just lots of handsome, stalwart> troops and beguiling, brown-faced grins that communicate: Freedom! Liberation!> Smiles! They love us! We may have brutally, systematically raped their country> (and the rape continues), but they want it! They really want us to bomb the> shit out of them. They like that.” 1 Image [../Images/00016.jpg]Figure 11: The truth about the ‘war’ with Iraq. It was not about “liberation”,but American conquest on behalf of the Illuminati that controls the USgovernment Image [../Images/00017.jpg]Figure 12: Manufactured Illusion: the virtually deserted square as the Saddamstatue is toppled by US troops. Carefully shot close ups gave the impression ofcheering Iraqi crowds. But where are they? Yes, the media fell for the propaganda as usual and, indeed, many US networkexecutives and owners were involved in the plot. Television stations andnewspapers across the world blazed the picture of the toppling Saddam and thecheering Iraqis across their screens and front pages to give the mindmanipulators exactly what they wanted. Spin doctors: 33,666,911,000; the truth:0. On March 19th, just before the slaughter began, I wrote the following on mywebsite, www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com]. It was headed “ThePlayground Bullies”:> “The US and UK have firepower unprecedented in known human history. By> comparison the Iraqis are trying to stop an elephant stampede with a popgun.> The war, therefore, will not be a war at all. It will be a gang of playground> bullies kicking the shit out of the seven-stone weakling with the glasses and> the callipers. The speed by which they do this (and the efficiency with which> they suppress news of civilian casualties) will be presented as a ‘glorious> victory’ as the bullies take over the playground and dictate its rules under> the guise of ‘freeing the people from a brutal dictatorship’. > “The truth is that while Saddam is a brutal dictator, put in place by the very> forces that now seek to remove him, he is not in the class of those who will> now replace him as the dictators to the people. If anyone still believes that> the post-Saddam ‘Iraqi’ regime will not be controlled by the same fascists> behind this ‘war’, I have an antique computer they might like to buy. It was> made in 1593.”2 Of course that is what happened and it hardly took a genius to see it comingbecause the plan is the same every time: emphasise what you want the people tobelieve and suppress or downplay anything that would give them a differentperspective. For this reason it was vital to focus on Saddam’s toppling statuewhile talking as little as possible about the “collateral damage” – dead andhorrifically maimed parents and children. Most of the mainstream media gave thespinners all the support they needed. Would CNN have had a live camera pointingfor two hours at a dead and dismembered child? Or inside a devastated hospitaltrying to treat the children with scorched bodies and missing limbs like thosein Figures 13, 14 and 15? That would have provided the truly defining moment andreality of this mass murder, but that is not the idea. Instead the image thespinners wanted people to remember was the one that got the coverage and Arabstations were condemned for showing the true price of war. Everything is spinand aimed at the cameras and the minds of the people. It has nothing to do withtruth or facts. Journalist Robert Fisk reported on how American troops openedfire on the car of Quiz al-Selman, a Danish engineer in Baghdad. He was carryinghis Danish passport, driving licence and medical records, but that didn’t matterto the troops who approached him. He said he told them he was a scientificresearcher, but they made him lie down in the street, tied his arms behind hisback with plastic-and-steel cuffs and tied his feet before putting him into amilitary vehicle. This is what happened next:> “After 10 minutes in the vehicle, I was taken out again. There were> journalists with cameras. The group of Americans untied me, then made me lie> on the road again. Then, in front of the cameras, they tied my hands and feet> all over again and put me back in the vehicle.” 3 Image [../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 13: The face of war they don’t want you to see … Image [../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 14: … pictures of dead and mutilated children were censored by Westerntelevision … Image [../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 15: … and the true and horrific consequences of the manipulated slaughterwere hidden from the public It’s a mind game.Red write districtThe American television networks like Fox, CNN, NBC and ABC are an affront toall that is considered to be human and those who take their dirty dollar and dotheir bidding are engaged in intellectual prostitution. In Britain, the tabloidSun is owned, like Fox/Fix News and William Kristol’s Weekly Standard, by RupertMurdoch. The Sun ran this headline about the Iraqis: “Show them no pity: theyhave stains on their souls.”4 Better than not having one at all, I guess,because you have sold it to Rupert Murdoch. Sun feature writer Katy Weitz quitin protest at the paper’s coverage of the war. The Sun was supporting theMurdoch line, she said, and no one was going to challenge that. “I want to beproud of the work I help to produce, not shudder in shame at its front-pageblood lust”, she wrote in The Guardian.5 Some of her fellow journalists felt thesame, but they wouldn’t leave because they needed the job, while others said sheshould keep her views to herself. “I can’t bear to hear people knocking theirpaper – it’s like hearing them bad-mouth their family”, one “journalist” toldher. What about the families in Iraq? Katy Weitz is a rare exception. As shesaid, the general reaction from colleagues was: “Goodness me … a journalist withprinciples. Wonders will never cease.”6MSNBC correspondent Ashleigh Banfield angered her employers when she gave alecture at Kansas State University on April 24th 2003 about the war coverage andwhat she called the “big show”.7 She described what the global audience was notallowed to see. Nobody witnessed the real horrors of what happened, she said,and so people could not “seriously revisit the concept of warfare the next timewe have to deal with it”. There had been a lot of dissenting voices before theconflict about the horrors of war, but she was very concerned that the“three-week TV show” may have changed people’s opinions. “It was verysanitized”, she said.8> “You didn’t see where those bullets landed. You didn’t see what happened when> the mortar landed. A puff of smoke is not what a mortar looks like when it> explodes, believe me. There are horrors that were completely left out of this> war. So was this journalism or was this coverage? There is a grand difference> between journalism and coverage, and getting access does not mean you’re> getting the story, it just means you’re getting one more arm or leg of the> story. And that’s what we got, and it was a glorious, wonderful picture that> had a lot of people watching and a lot of advertisers excited about cable> news. But it wasn’t journalism, because I’m not so sure that we in America are> hesitant to do this again, to fight another war, because it looked like a> glorious and courageous and so successful terrific endeavor, and we got rid of> a horrible leader: We got rid of a dictator, we got rid of a monster, but we> didn’t see what it took to do that. > “I can’t tell you how bad the civilian casualties were. I saw a couple of> pictures. I saw French television pictures, I saw a few things here and there,> but to truly understand what war is all about you’ve got to be on both sides.> You’ve got to be a unilateral, someone who’s able to cover from outside of> both front lines, which, by the way, is the most dangerous way to cover a war,> which is the way most of us covered Afghanistan … But we really don’t know> from this latest adventure from the American military what this thing looked> like and why perhaps we should never do it again. The other thing is that so> many voices were silent in this war. We all know what happened to [actress]> Susan Sarandon for speaking out, and her husband, and we all know that this is> not the way Americans truly want to be. Free speech is a wonderful thing, it’s> what we fight for, but the minute it’s unpalatable we fight against it for> some reason.” 9 Banfield said she was often ostracised for simply giving both sides of the storyin the Middle East – “just for going on television and saying, ‘Here’s what theleaders of Hezbollah are telling me and here’s what the Lebanese are telling meand here’s what the Syrians have said about Hezbollah’”. She said that a radiohost on MSNBC called Michael Savage was outraged that she dared to speak withthe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade about why they do what they do; why they areprepared to sacrifice themselves for what they call freedom fighting and otherscall terrorism. Savage, she said, labelled her a slut, a porn star and an“accomplice to the murder of Jewish children”.10 This is unbelievable unless youhave heard some of these American mainstream ‘talk show’ hosts at work. Manyhave mouths the size of the planet and brains the size of a pea, but they aretelling America what to think, or rather not to. In 1991, some called fornuclear attacks on Iraq. “How can you discuss, how can you solve anything”,Banfield said, “when attacks from a mere radio flak is what America hears on aregular basis, let alone at the government level?” If this kind of attitude isprevailing, she added, forget discussion and forget diplomacy. What does thatleave us with? War. Banfield highlighted the truly disgraceful Fox/Fix News ofRupert Murdoch. She talked of the “Fox effect” with its one-sided patriotism andlack of anything remotely resembling journalism. Cable news operators hadwrapped themselves in the American flag and patriotism, she said, and targeted acertain demographic audience. It had been very lucrative and you could alreadysee the effects on the other networks as they hired more and more right wingcontributors. All of this was because of Fox, she said, and its successes intaking viewers from other networks. What she is saying is that next time they goto war the ‘news’ coverage will be even worse.Institutionalised racismI was in America for part of the ‘war’ and I saw the countless emotionallycharged stories about US troops who died in Iraq. “Terrible news”, I heard CNNsay. “Two US soldiers have been killed in a missile attack.” There wereinterviews with the families of troops who would not be coming home alive andthe interviewers said how awful it must be for them. I understand this, butnever did I hear a thought for what the families of dead Iraqi civilians must begoing through. The parents who saw their children blown apart and children whowatched the same happen to their mums and dads. Dead Iraqi civilians are not“terrible news”, it seems; they are unfortunate and unavoidable “collateraldamage”. I saw a Christian TV channel suspend its programming to urge theviewers to “pray for our troops”. No mention of praying for Iraqis. But thenthey are Muslims and why would the Christian god give a shit about them? Itsickens my stomach to see such blatant racism in the way this ‘war’, and allsuch ‘wars’, are portrayed. Do people with brown faces not have emotions everybit as traumatic and unimaginable as the relatives of US troops? The troops madethe choice to go, the Iraqi and Afghan civilians had no such luxury. The UnitedStates is the leader of the ‘free world’? It holds the high ground of morality?Those who believe such blatant nonsense drown in a cesspit of mass murder andself-congratulation.Let’s hear it for the heroes …Those ‘heroic’ troops dropped an estimated 30,000 bombs on Iraqis from the airalone at a fantastic cost in human suffering and financial outlay. This is aworld that has billions living in poverty, yet every Tomahawk cruise missilecosts around a million dollars and the overall military cost is closing in on100 billion dollars. They targeted a land in which some 60 per cent of the 24million people were children. I see nothing heroic in that. The most famousvictim of this fascist carnage was Ali Ismail Abbas, the 12-year-old who lostboth his parents and both arms in the US and British bombing of Baghdad. He alsosuffered appalling burns to his body. “It was midnight when the missile fell onus”, he told Reuters at the Kindi Hospital. Thinking about his uncertain future,he asked whether he could get artificial arms. “Can you help get my arms back?Do you think the doctors can get me another pair of hands?” Abbas asked. “If Idon’t get a pair of hands I will commit suicide”, he said with tears spillingdown his cheeks. The Reuters report continued:> “His aunt, three cousins and three other relatives staying with them were also> killed in this week’s missile strikes on their house in Diala Bridge district> east of Baghdad. ‘We didn’t want war. I was scared of this war’, said Abbas.> ‘Our house was just a poor shack, why did they want to bomb us?’ said the> young boy. With a childhood lost and a future clouded by disaster and> disability, Abbas poured his heart out as he lay in bed with an improvised> wooden cage over his chest to stop his burned flesh touching the bed covers.> ‘I wanted to become an army officer when I grow up, but not anymore. Now I> want to become a doctor, but how can I? I don’t have hands’, he said. His> aunt, Jamila Abbas, 53, looked after him, feeding him, washing him, comforting> him with prayers and repeatedly telling him his parents had gone to heaven.> Abbas’ suffering offered one snapshot of the daily horrors afflicting Iraqi> civilians in the devastating US- led war on Iraq.” 11 Only a public outcry about his plight in the Baghdad hospital, overwhelmed bythe casualties and under supplied with drugs and doctors, led to Ali being flownto a hospital in Kuwait. An Iraqi nurse, Fatin Sharhah, wrote a letter to Bushand Blair that said: “You have all this technology to bomb us … but you cannotspare one aircraft for one day to save a life?” 12 Ah yes, but highlighting thestory of kids like Ali would not support the US and British spin on theirslaughter and so they ignore the suffering until they are forced to act becausethe news is out. Then those who caused the suffering are portrayed as the goodguy heroes helping a little child to ‘live’. As doctors and aid agenciesstressed, Ali was only one of countless children who suffered similarconsequences and for what? To allow Illuminati corporations to take over Iraqand its oil reserves and install themselves as the controlling force in theMiddle East. “Ali’s voice is one among millions of children’s voices we’re nothearing”, said Kathryn Irwin, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF).13 It is they who suffer and die, so people like the Bushes,Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, Perle, Blair and the rest can impose theagenda they slavishly serve for a global fascist state. While the peoplesuffered from their unimaginable injuries, the effects of the bombing closedmost hospitals in Iraq, along with the looting that ensued from the chaos. Thosethat were open had few medicines and no electricity or clean water. UNICEFspokeswoman, Kathryn Irwin said: “Hospitals are having to deal with ill childrenwithout the drugs they need and without water – how can you treat someonewithout clean water?” I am sure Bush and Blair thought of nothing else. TheInternational Committee of the Red Cross spokesman in Baghdad, RolandHuguenin-Benjamin, said an average of 100 civilian casualties a day were beingrecorded at hospitals in the capital.14 Dr Huguenin-Benjamin and his staff werealso shocked by the numbers of dead and injured in a hospital in the town ofHillah: “That hospital where we had a chance of travelling with our own surgeonwas utterly overwhelmed by hundreds of civilian casualties brought in, in justover 48 hours”, he said, “And there were lots and lots of dead bodies that werepractically dismembered by the violence of the explosion they had been subjectedto.” 15 Here is some more of the reality behind the glorious victory that CNN,Fix News and the other mainstream networks fail to mention:> “Just a few weeks ago, Ayesha, a young and fragile Iraqi girl, was looking> forward to her seventh birthday this coming May. Those aspirations were> quickly snuffed out by a US bomb that literally sucked away the insides of her> skull, leaving behind the grotesque remains of a shattered dream. The blood> that flowed from her small, frail body onto the dirt beneath made sure of> that. It was those first images we witnessed that truly reflected the> operation that US President George W. Bush has dubbed ‘freedom’. Yes, Ayesha> is free from further tyranny, and countless other innocent souls have followed> her path towards freedom from Bush; but there are others today who are being> subjected to no less a fate. > “From bombs dropped incessantly on a helpless population, to civilians strafed> by US aircraft, to women and children shredded to pieces by gunning ground> troops, this is not a war. This is the terrorism that is of the worst kind.> For it is purveyed under the cloak of legitimacy, and in the name of a ‘great’> democracy.” 16 And:> “The moaning of Aisha Ahmed, eight, fills the hospital’s emergency ward. One> of hundreds of child victims in the 15-day-old US-led war in Iraq, she lost> one eye and her face and body are peppered with wounds from what must have> been a storm of shrapnel. ‘Mummy! I want my mummy. Where is my mummy?’ Aisha> kept muttering. Yet neither the nurse nor the neighbor trying to comfort her> dared to answer. Her four-year-old brother Mohammad died and her mother and> other brother were in critical condition undergoing surgery for head and chest> injuries. Her father and two sisters were all badly injured and in another> hospital. A neighbor said he saw missiles crash into Radwaniyeh, a remote area> near Baghdad’s airport on Wednesday morning. > “To their misfortune, they live in an area that — apart from their farm — has> a presidential palace complex and military positions. A total of 12 children> and six adults were struck. US war headquarters in Qatar said that a farm at> Radwaniyeh doubled as a military ‘command and control facility.’ Washington> says it seeks to minimize civilian casualties in its war to oust President> Saddam Hussein. Aisha was with her cousin and neighbors playing in the garden> during a lull in the fighting when a missile struck, the neighbor said. ‘We> heard the planes and then the big explosion. We saw these houses in flames,> and ran to rescue them and get them out from under the rubble. We did not> expect them to hit civilians during a lull,’ the neighbor said.” 17 And:> “Doctor Ahmed Abdel Amir said children were bound to make up a large number of> casualties because they are such a big proportion of Iraq’s 26 million> population. Another child, Mohammad Kazem, seven, lay in the next bed with> serum tubes strapped to him. He was hit by shrapnel in the stomach when a> missile crashed near his home west of Baghdad.

The only question he keeps asking is: ‘Mummy when will this banging> stop?’ she added. Such scenes have become part of daily life in Iraq since the> US-led war started with a fierce air attack and a ground invasion on March> 20.” 18 And:> “Mohammad al-Jammal, six, was also screaming from his wounds. He too had been> standing outside his house when a missile struck, killing two people and> sending shrapnel into his stomach, opening it to the intestines.

They say their> children refuse to eat or sleep.” 19 And:> “Amid the wreckage I counted 12 dead civilians, lying in the road or in nearby> ditches. All had been trying to leave this southern town overnight, probably> for fear of being killed by US helicopter attacks and heavy artillery. Their> mistake had been to flee over a bridge that is crucial to the coalition’s> supply lines and to run into a group of shell-shocked young American marines> with orders to shoot anything that moved.

His savings, perhaps. > “Down the road, a little girl, no older than five and dressed in a pretty> orange and gold dress, lay dead in a ditch next to the body of a man who may> have been her father. Half his head was missing. Nearby, in a battered old> Bolga, peppered with ammunition holes, an Iraqi woman – perhaps the girl’s> mother – was dead, slumped in the back seat.

Our guide says they will now wash her body,> drape it in white and before dusk lay her in the ground. It has been one of> the saddest episodes I have ever witnessed in my 26 years reporting for this> newspaper.” 21 And:> “Doctors who treated Iraqi victims of two previous wars say they are taken> aback by the injuries they have seen. Most suffered massive trauma and fatal> wounds, including head, abdominal and limb injuries from lethal weapons, they> said. ‘I’ve been a doctor for 25 years and this is the worst I’ve seen in> terms of the number of casualties and fatal wounds,’ said Duleimi, 48, who> witnessed the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and the 1991 Gulf War. ‘This is a disaster> because they’re attacking civilians. We are receiving a lot of civilian> casualties’, he added. ‘This war is more destructive than all the previous> wars.

The cruise missile that exploded close to her> home in the Radwaniyeh suburb of Baghdad blasted shrapnel into her tiny legs –> they were bound up with gauze – and, far more seriously, into her spine. Now> she has lost all movement in her left leg.” 23 You could fill a library of such stories and when they want to bounce the worldinto a repeat in Iran, Syria or wherever, perhaps it would be worth asking thosesupporting another carnage to read those accounts before they urge the people to“support the troops” in the latest ‘glorious liberation’. Most did not see orhear such stories amid the triumphalism of a US president and vice president whoboth avoided the draft to Vietnam while supporting conscription for others. Thisis the president who said (no, his scriptwriters said) that when Iraqis lookinto the faces of American troops, “they see strength and kindness andgoodwill”.24 No, they see death, destruction and occupation of their land andthey see a vicious, brainless, heartless front man in the White House who caresnothing of their plight. A president who talked about “we” are making progressin the war when “we” were spending most of the time watching sport on the WhiteHouse television as the devastation continued. But when you come from a familywith a truly stupendous record of supporting fascism, abusing and murderingchildren, and removing those who get in your way, the consequences for Iraqicivilians do not enter the equation (it’s a mathematical term, George). In fact,it’s a good laugh to them and I’m not kidding. If anyone has a problem withthat, they should read some of my other books. To confirm the real mindsetbehind this war, I watched Lt General Claudia Kennedy (ret) on CNN responding tothe American tank attack on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad that was home to theinternational journalists. She said she hoped the military would not agoniseover every such incident (no chance of that) because winning the war was allthat really mattered. Once there was small arms fire from the hotel it became a“legitimate military target”, she said, even though it was full of men, womenand children. This is the mentality that is planning more such conquests. Whatwas that Rumsfeld told his heroic troops? “With the liberation of Iraq, you havetransformed the country. But how you did it will transform how we defend ourcountry in the 21st century.” What does it matter to Bush, Cheney, Powell,Rumsfeld or Blair that people like 72-year-old Abid Hassan Hamoodi lostvirtually his entire family when a US/UK ‘coalition’ (demolition) aircraft‘mistakenly’ bombed his home in Basra?> “I lost 10 of my family. I once lived in that house with six other relatives,> now I am alone. Just before the invasion started much of my family came to> stay in my home, it being made of reinforced concrete and very strong.

I remember being on the 702 radio stationin South Africa talking about the background to the war when a guy called “Mike”came on. This was an idiot of unbelievable magnitude. “What planet are you on?”was all he could say, ignoring every opportunity to answer the question: “Whatresearch have you done into these matters?” He even castigated the presenter forhaving me on the programme to say such things. When people ask me how a few cancontrol the world, Moron Mike often gets a mention these days. If it wasn’t forpeople like him – and there are billions of them – none of this would bepossible.Fodder in uniform (brain optional, but not encouraged)Many people of the Mike mentality are in the military or “the cavalry on the newAmerican frontier”, as the Project for the New American Century describes them.They are a mixture of John Wayne wannabes; psychopaths who can hide theirsickness behind the cover of military legitimacy; those who genuinely think theyare serving their country while serving the Illuminati; and others who arebasically dumb and have to be told what to do. Take Tyler Aholt, a member of aNaval construction force called the Seabees, who said this of the peopleprotesting against the war: “If they are not backing up those that are in chargeof us, then in the long run, they’re not backing us up.” Take a deep breath andwait for the punch-line: “I’ve considered if some of the protesters evenunderstand the whole idea of war: without war, how can you have peace?” 26 AsEinstein said: “Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity.And I am not so sure about the former.” Then there was this guy reported in theUK Sunday Times: “The Iraqis are sick people and we are the chemotherapy”, saidCorporal Ryan Dupre. “I am starting to hate this country. Wait till I get holdof a friggin’ Iraqi. No, I won’t get hold of one. I’ll just kill him.” 27Stephen Eagle Funk, a 20-year-old marine reserve who refused to fight in Iraq,said that many of his fellow recruits envied him when they thought he was goingto be sent into battle. “They would say things like, ‘Kill a raghead for me –I’m so jealous,’” he said.28 Another soldier recorded by the BBC said: “We goddaget this cargo up front, the sooner we get [it there], the sooner they can killsome of these people that need killin’, the sooner we can go home.” 29In the same programme came this gem from a boy soldier taking part in the‘liberation’: “We bomb ‘em, you know it’s cool to me because I like explosionsand stuff like that, but, like, I don’t get to see the actual explosion, andthat’s what I want to see, but I guess when we get closer to Baghdad we’ll getto see more of that.” 30 Hey, Cap’n, I just killed 14 of them there brown facesand my machine won’t give me extended play, sir. A British soldier was arrestedafter staff in a photo-processing store gave photographs to the police thatindicate British troops tortured and sexually abused Iraqi prisoners of war. Oneshows a man stripped to the waist while suspended from a rope attached to aforklift truck. A soldier driving the truck is apparently laughing at hisplight. Others appear to show an Iraqi man forced to perform oral sex on a whitesoldier; two others forced to have anal sex; and two naked Iraqis cowering onthe ground. Officers from the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal MilitaryPolice arrested Gary Bartlam, a private in the First Battalion of the RoyalRegiment of Fusiliers. He was on leave from the regiment stationed in Iraq’ssecond city Basra and the port of Umm Qasr. The British army is as brutal as anyof them. Then there were the schoolboy slogans the juveniles would write ontheir tanks and missiles. The brilliant writer, Arundhati Roy, said in the UKGuardian:> “On the steel torsos of their missiles, adolescent American soldiers scrawl> colourful messages in childish handwriting: For Saddam, from the Fat Boy> Posse. A building goes down. A marketplace. A home. A girl who loves a boy. A> child who only ever wanted to play with his older brother’s marbles.” 31 This is the sort of mentality, if you can call it that, which is fighting thesewars of ‘liberation’. Peter Arnett, the veteran war reporter sacked by NBCduring the Iraqi invasion, told in the UK Daily Mirror of his experiences withsuch dumbos. He said that the United States was bringing enormous firepower tobear to grind down the Iraqis and he had seen it all before:> “During the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, I entered a US-held town which had been> totally destroyed. The Viet Cong had taken over and were threatening the> commander’s building so he called down an artillery strike which killed many> of his own men. The Major with us asked: ‘How could this happen?’ A soldier> replied: ‘Sir, we had to destroy the town to save it’.” 32 There were others in Iraq, however, that did allow the reality of war toregister, including this soldier quoted by the Sunday Times: “Did you see allthat?” he asked, his eyes filled with tears. “Did you see that little baby girl?I carried her body and buried it as best I could but I had no time. It reallygets to me to see children being killed like this, but we had no choice.” 33 Anunderstandable reaction, but of course he did have a choice. He had a choice notto be there. Sergeant Ray Simon of the US 3rd Infantry Division put it very wellwhen he said: “We get up in the morning, go and kill people, stop for a lunchbreak, then kill some more, before going to sleep. This thing is gettingridiculous.” 34 There are decent, caring people in the military who do believethey are helping people. But these genuine soldiers are being duped. Tens ofthousands of civilians were killed by US and British forces and hundreds ofthousands injured – people like 20-year-old Akeel Kadhim, a student whose leftleg was amputated. “I was shot by the Americans”, he said, “I was running toanother wounded person, trying to save him … We are innocent. We were notfighting. We were not resisting. I tried to save an innocent person. Why didthey shoot me?” 35Can a ‘smart’ bomb be used by an idiot? Apparently so.Once again the public were manipulated into believing in the invincibility ofthe ‘smart’ bombs that only hit their intended targets and arrogant militaryspokesmen like Brigadier General Vince Brooks, Deputy Commander at CentralCommand, would give journalists a daily dose of this conditioning with videos oftheir accuracy. Meanwhile ‘smart’ bombs aimed for Iraqi towns and cities werelanding in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. Whenever they landed their lethalcargo in civilian areas or the US military shot civilians, Mr. Brooks andcompany became much less talkative and they would immediately muddy the watersby saying, “We don’t know exactly what happened, we are investigating”. The ideais to hope that no one asks again. The cynicism reached new lows when a USmissile landed in a Baghdad market killing more than 60 in the Baghdad districtof Shu’ale and people like Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, GeneralRichard Myers, sought to blame it on the Iraqis. It could have been Iraqianti-aircraft fire, they said, when there was none by this time in the conflict.UK Independent journalist, Robert Fisk, found a fragment of the missile with itscode number and The Guardian newspaper reported:> “ … It has emerged – as a result of detective work on the Internet by a> Guardian reader – that the explosion in a Baghdad market which killed more> than 60 people last Friday was indeed caused by a cruise missile and not an> Iraqi anti-aircraft rocket as the US has suggested. A metal fragment found at> the scene by British journalist Robert Fisk carried various markings,> including ‘MFR 96214 09’. This, our reader pointed out in an email, is a> manufacturer’s identification number known as a ‘cage code’. > “Cage codes can be looked up on the internet (www.gidm.dlis.dla.mil> [http://www.gidm.dlis.dla.mil]), and keying in the number 96214 traces the> fragment back to a plant in McKinney, Texas, owned by the Raytheon Company.> Raytheon, whose headquarters are in Lexington, Massachusetts, aspires ‘to be> the most admired defense and aerospace systems supplier through world-class> people and technology’, according to its website (www.raytheon.com> [http://www.raytheon.com]). It makes a vast array of military equipment,> including the AGM-129 cruise missile which is launched from B-52 bombers.” 36 Lewis Libby, Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, has shares in Raytheon Corp, whichwas selected with Kellogg Brown and Root to destroy ‘weapons of massdestruction’ in Iraq.37 Many defence analysts have agreed that what happened atthe Shu’ale market was almost certainly due to a Harm, which carries a warheaddesigned to explode into thousands of aluminium fragments, hence the injuriesinflicted. In a similar incident, 21 Iraqi civilians were killed by a US/Britishmissile unleashed by the forces of tyranny. A Red Crescent maternity hospitalwas bombed and in al-Janabiy, in the southeast of Baghdad, photographer PatrickBaz, a veteran of the conflict in Beirut in the 1980s, found a farm pulverizedby missiles with at least 20 dead inside, including 11 children.38 Members ofthe US 3rd infantry division shot dead seven women and children travelling intheir car at a checkpoint set up by the occupying force. A Washington Postreporter at the scene said ten were killed, including five children who appearedto be younger than five years old.39 The report described the vehicle as afour-wheel-drive Toyota crammed with the Iraqis’ personal belongings. Themilitary spokesman lied as always, saying the car did not respond to warningshots, but the Washington Post reporter said that Captain Ronny Johnson shoutedat his troops: “You just fucking killed a family because you didn’t fire awarning shot soon enough!”40“We do all we can to protect civilians”The indiscriminate killings of civilians were a constant feature of the invasionand these have continued since the occupation began. When US troops exploded anarms dump close to a civilian area at Hai al-Muallimin on April 26th 2003killing 12 people, they said it had been targeted by Iraqis. This was despitethe fact that the US forces had been exploding Iraqi arms dumps all over thecountry and the people in the area had already asked them to move the one inquestion because any explosion threatened civilians. Sabi Hassoun, a 70-year-oldgreat-grandfather lost six members of his family – a son, three grandsons andtwo of their wives, the BBC reported, and near him a little boy was cryinginconsolably. He lost both his parents in the disaster.41 At least 13 civilianswere killed and scores injured when US troops opened fire on a demonstration inthe town of Falluja, 35 miles from Baghdad. The protestors were demanding thatthe military leave the local school to allow the children to return to theirlessons. The US military, as always, said they had been fired on, but witnessessaid only stones were thrown. Most of the dead and injured were young people andthe next day two more were shot dead by US bullets during a protest against thefirst killings. In another incident, troops opened fire on a crowd opposing theappointment of a new pro-American (of course) governor in the northern city ofMosul. Ten died and around a hundred were injured. Thousands more Iraqis havebeen killed by US troops since the ‘major’ war officially ended and the foddertroops have also continued to be killed almost by the day at the time ofwriting. Civilians were not only hit, they were on many occasions targeted, asthey always are. A Belgian news photographer, Laurent Van der Stockt, workingfor the Gamma agency and under contract for the New York Times Magazine,followed the advance of US Marines (3rd battalion, 4th regiment) for threeweeks, up to the taking of Baghdad on April 9th. Van der Stockt has worked inmany war zones, including the first Gulf War, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Chechnya,Africa and the Occupied Territories. He told the Le Monde newspaper in France ofhis experiences with the same troops that would topple the Saddam statue infront of the world media. Van der Stockt said he saw American troops takingevery opportunity to tear down portraits of Saddam Hussein. “They were doingthis right in front of the local inhabitants, whose elation quickly vanished”,he said. “The soldiers obviously didn’t imagine that it was up to the Iraqis tobe doing this or that it was humiliating for them.” 42 He told Le Monde:> “During the first few days, with colleagues from the New York Times and> Newsweek, I tried to follow the convoys in a SUV by playing hide-and-seek. We> were spending a lot of time then with the 1,500 Marines of the 3/4, commanded> by Colonel Bryan P. McCoy … their motto is ‘Search and Kill’. The ‘Kilo’ unit> is nicknamed ‘Killer Kilo’. The words ‘Carnivore’ or ‘Blind Killer’ are> painted on their tanks. McCoy could snap with a ‘shame on you’, a smile> flashing across his face to the sniper who had just finished telling him:> ‘I’ve got eight, sir, but only five’. Literally meaning: I’ve shot eight, but> only five of them are dead’.” 43 Van der Stockt said he had never seen a war with so few ‘returns’. The Iraqiarmy was like a ghost, it barely existed, he said. Over the three weeks, he onlysaw the Iraqi ‘army’ fire a few short-range rockets and a few shots. He sawdeserted trenches, a dead Iraqi soldier lying next to a piece of bread and someold equipment. There was nothing that really made him feel that there was a realconfrontation going on, nothing comparable to the “massiveness of the means atthe Americans’ disposal”. On April 6th, he and the Marines were at the outskirtsof Baghdad, facing a strategic bridge the Americans called “the Baghdad HighwayBridge”. Residential areas were now much greater in number, but American sniperswere ordered to kill anything coming in their direction. That night a teenagerwho was crossing the bridge was killed. Van der Stockt described to Le Mondewhat followed:> “On the morning of April 7, the Marines decided to cross the bridge. A shell> fell onto an armored personnel carrier. Two marines were killed. The crossing> took on a tragic aspect. The soldiers were stressed, febrile. They were> shouting. The risk didn’t appear to be that great, so I followed their> advance. They were howling, shouting orders and positions to each other. It> sounded like something in-between a phantasm, mythology and conditioning. The> operation was transformed into crossing the bridge over the River Kwai. > “Later, there was some open terrain. The Marines were advancing and taking up> position, hiding behind mounds of earth. They were still really tense. A small> blue van was moving towards the convoy. Three not-very-accurate warning shots> were fired. The shots were supposed to make the van stop. The van kept on> driving, made a U-turn, took shelter and then returned slowly. The Marines> opened fire. All hell broke loose. They were firing all over the place. You> could hear ‘Stop firing’ being shouted. The silence that set in was> overwhelming. Two men and a woman had just been riddled with bullets. So this> was the enemy, the threat. > “A second vehicle drove up. The same scenario was repeated. Its passengers> were killed on the spot. A grandfather was walking slowly with a cane on the> sidewalk. They killed him too. As with the old man, the Marines fired on a SUV> driving along the river bank that was getting too close to them. Riddled with> bullets, the vehicle rolled over. Two women and a child got out, miraculously> still alive. They sought refuge in the wreckage. A few seconds later, it flew> into bits as a tank lobbed a terse shot into it. > “Marines are conditioned to reach their target at any cost, by staying alive> and facing any type of enemy. They abusively make use of disproportionate> firepower. These hardened troops, followed by tons of equipment, supported by> extraordinary artillery power, protected by fighter jets and cutting-edge> helicopters, were shooting on local inhabitants who understood absolutely> nothing of what was going on. With my own eyes I saw about fifteen civilians> killed in two days. I’ve gone through enough wars to know that it’s always> dirty, that civilians are always the first victims. But the way it was> happening here, it was insane.” 44 Van der Stockt said that at the “roughest moment”, the most humane of the troopswas a guy called Doug who gave real warning shots, aiming for tyres or theengine, and saving at least ten lives in two hours, according to thephotographer. Distraught soldiers were saying: “I ain’t prepared for this; Ididn’t come here to shoot civilians.” Van der Stockt continued:> “I drove away a girl who had had her humerus pierced by a bullet. Enrico was> holding her in his arms. In the rear, the girl’s father was protecting his> young son, wounded in the torso and losing consciousness. The man spoke in> gestures to the doctor at the back of the lines, pleading: ‘I don’t> understand, I was walking and holding my children’s hands. Why didn’t you> shoot in the air? Or at least shoot me?’ In Baghdad, McCoy sped up the march.> He stopped taking the time to search houses one-by-one. He wanted to get to> Paradise Place as soon as possible [the location of the Saddam statue and the> long-planned photo opportunity captured by the media]. The Marines were not> firing on the thickening population. The course ended with Saddam’s statue> being toppled. There were more journalists at the scene than Baghdadis. Its> five million inhabitants stayed at home.” 45 Robert Fisk described this cold-blooded murder by an American military sniper inthe UK Independent:> “An American Marine sniper sitting atop the palace gate wounded three> civilians, including a little girl, in a car that failed to halt – then shot> and killed a man who had walked on to his balcony to discover the source of> the firing. Within minutes, the sniper also shot dead the driver of another> car and wounded two more passengers in that vehicle, including a young woman.> A crew from Channel 4 Television was present when the killings took place.” 46 But most of the time in this high-tech warfare the killers never even see theirvictims. MSNBC correspondent Ashleigh Banfield said the tanks and the vehiclesused in the front lines are so high tech that an artillery engineer can pinpointa target on a screen and destroy it without ever seeing a warm body. “Some ofthe soldiers, according to our [embedded reporters], had never seen a dead bodythroughout the entire three-week campaign”, she said, “It was like Game Boy.” 47Toys for the boysThe psychopathic, juvenile and dumb have in their hands the most destructivefirepower in known human history. The latest little gem is the Massive OrdnanceAir Blast Bomb or Moab, the ‘Mother of all Bombs’. The use of the name, Moab,would never be a coincidence to the symbolism-obsessed Illuminati. Moab is aname familiar to readers of the Old Testament as in the Plains of Moab, nearJericho (Numbers 22:1, 26:63, Joshua 13:32), where the Israelites are claimed tohave made their last encampment before they entered the Promised Land aftertheir alleged journey through the wilderness. The Bible says that the charactercalled Moses died in Moab. The location also has associations with Freemasonry.The bomb of the same name is the most powerful non-nuclear weapon on the planet.The Moab detonates 21,000lb of explosives above the ground and is guided by thesatellite-linked global positioning system. It can trigger temperatures of up to538C (1,000F) and has an awesome destructive power. I wonder if this just mightqualify as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’? Imagine that dropping on a civilianarea or anywhere. Wade Frazier’s excellent study of the Gulf ‘War’ reveals thebackground to another weapon used against the Iraqi people:> “The [fuel-air] bomb works thus: there are two detonations; the first spreads> a fine mist of fuel into the air, turning the area [about the size of a> football field] into an explosive mix of vast proportion; then a second> detonation ignites the mixture, causing an awesome explosion. The explosion is> about the most powerful ‘conventional’ explosion we know of. > “At a pressure shock of up to 200 pounds per square inch (PSI), people in its> detonation zone are often killed by the sheer compression of the air around> them. Human beings can typically withstand up to about a 40-PSI shock. The> bomb sucks oxygen out of the air, and can apparently even suck the lungs out> through the mouths of people unfortunate enough to be in the detonation zone.> Our military used it on helpless people [in the 1991 Gulf Slaughter].” 48 Image [../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 16: Would a hungry child spot the difference? The ‘food’ parcels andcluster bomblets were both dropped by US forces and both were the same colouryellow. How sick can you get? Image [../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 17: What cluster bombs do: this is only one of tens of thousands ofvictims mutilated by US cluster bombs in South East Asia. The US and UK droppedthese same weapons on civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq. Still support thetroops, do we? These weapons were used in Afghanistan and the two wars on Iraq. On one end ofthis process is a ‘hero’ in a uniform pressing a button and on the other aremen, women and children exploding into pieces. The Iraqi population weresubjected to a lovely piece of hardware called a ‘Big Blue’, which produces ashock wave only eclipsed by nuclear weapons. Wade Frazier points out that thepower of the shock wave can turn a body into a hamburger. Also deployed were the‘bouncing bombs’ that are designed to ‘bounce’ to waist height before explodingand ensure a better chance of hitting people. There is the ‘Beehive’ bomb thatexplodes 8,800 pieces of razor-edged shrapnel in all directions, tearing peopleapart. The US and British heroes and liberators bombarded Iraq, as they didAfghanistan, with lethal cluster bombs that cause horrendous civilian death andsuffering. Cluster bombs can be delivered by aircraft, artillery or missile.Each one releases dozens, often hundreds of smaller ‘bomblets’ or ‘grenades’. Inturn, each of these contains hundreds of metal fragments. Just one of thesefragments can rupture the spleen or cause the intestines to explode.49 Theseweapons are particularly indiscriminate and if you are there when they fall,that’s just too bad. So many of these bomblets fail to explode initially thattheir use peppers the landscape with landmines waiting to go off when anyunknowing child touches them. In Afghanistan the sick minds at the Pentagondropped “food parcels” that were almost identical in colour and design as thecluster bomblets (Figure 16). In Laos, where there are still an estimated 10million (or more) unexploded American cluster bombs, people are still beingkilled almost every day from these weapons dropped 30 years ago (Figure 17).50During the 1991 Gulf War more than 30 million cluster bomblets were dropped onKuwait and Iraq. Unexploded bombs later killed 1,600 civilians and injuredanother 2,500. A study by the Red Cross revealed that children in Kosovo arefive times more likely to be killed or injured by a NATO-dropped unexplodedcluster bomb than by a Serbian landmine. Today in Afghanistan the killing alsostill continues, as it does in Iraq. Reports in August 2003 suggested that athousand Iraqi children had already died this way. More than 50 internationalorganizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, HumanRights Watch, Amnesty International and the International Committee to BanLandmines have called for a moratorium on cluster bomb use, but the US andBritain go on using them.51 When you think that all these weapons and more weredeployed against Iraq, is it any wonder that people suffered such grotesqueinjuries from this scale of savagery?Cluster bombing BabylonThe outstanding British journalist (yes, a real one), Robert Fisk, detailed inthe UK Independent the consequences for Iraqis from the cluster bombs used bythe US and/or British forces in Iraq. Reporting from villages around the cityonce known as Babylon (how appropriate), he said that the wards of the Hillahteaching hospital contained the proof that “something illegal – something quiteoutside the Geneva Conventions” had occurred: the use of cluster bombs. Hedescribed the wailing children, the young women with breast and leg wounds, theten patients upon whom doctors had to perform brain surgery to remove metal fromtheir heads. They talked of the days and nights when the explosives fell “likegrapes” from the sky. Were they American or British aircraft that showered thesevillages with one of the most lethal weapons of modern warfare? Fisk wanted toknow. The 61 dead who had passed through the Hillah hospital could not say, hewrote, and nor could the survivors who, in many cases, were “sitting in theirhomes when the white canisters opened high above their village, spillingthousands of bomblets into the sky, exploding in the air, soaring throughwindows and doorways to burst indoors or bouncing off the roofs of the concretehuts to blow up later in the roadways … Some died at once, mostly women andchildren, some of whose blackened, decomposing remains lay in the tiny charnelhouse mortuary at the back of the Hillah hospital.” 52 The hospital treated 200wounded, besides the 61 dead, and many others were believed to have died whowere not brought to the hospital. Doctors said about 80 per cent of the victimswere civilians. Robert Fisk wrote:> “Heartbreaking is the only word to describe 10-year-old Maryam Nasr and her> five-year-old sister Hoda. Maryam has a patch over her right eye, where a> piece of bomblet embedded itself, and wounds to the stomach and thighs. I> didn’t realize that Hoda, standing by her sister’s bed, was wounded until her> mother carefully lifted the little girl’s scarf and long hair to show a deep> puncture in the right side of her head, just above her ear, congealed blood> sticking to her hair but the wound still gently bleeding. > “Their mother described how she had been inside her home and heard an> explosion and found her daughters in a pool of blood near the door. The little> girls alternately smiled and hid when I took their pictures. In other wards,> the hideously wounded would try to laugh, to show their bravery. It was a> humbling experience.” 53 Fisk described the mortuary as “a butcher’s shop of chopped-up corpses” andthere was a graphic account of the cluster-bomb carnage in the Asian Times.54 Itquoted Roland Huguenin-Benjamin, a spokesman for the International Committee ofthe Red Cross (ICRC) in Iraq, describing the scene in Hillah as “a horror,dozens of severed bodies and scattered limbs”. Journalists found “babies cut inhalf, amputated limbs, kids with their faces a web of deep cuts caused byAmerican shellfire and cluster bombs”. Nobody in the West saw these images ontheir television screens because they were censored and milder versionsdistributed. The Asia Times report said that an Arab cameramen told how he sawtwo trucks full of bodies – mostly children, and women in flowered dresses –parked outside the Hillah hospital.If you miss the first time – get ’em laterThe mass bombing made enormous additions to the depleted uranium left by theconflict of 1991 that has sent the rates of leukaemia, other cancers, anddeformed babies soaring. The British Ministry of Defence confirmed that troopsreturning from the Gulf were offered tests to assess the levels of depleteduranium in their bodies and establish if they were in danger of suffering kidneydamage and lung cancer.55 Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman of the RoyalSociety working group on depleted uranium, said: “It is highly unsatisfactory todeploy a large amount of a material that is weakly radioactive and chemicallytoxic without knowing how much soldiers and civilians have been exposed to it.”56 He said civilians in Iraq should be protected by checking milk and watersamples for depleted uranium over a prolonged period and that soldiers mightsuffer kidney damage and increased risk of lung cancer if they breathed insubstantial amounts. But, of course, we know the effect of this poison with theconsequences for the Iraqi people since 1991. Within three years of the conflictcancer in Iraq had increased 700% and thousands of troops are suffering fromGulf War Syndrome, which the authorities spent so long trying to dismiss.Despite the clear correlation between health effects and depleted uranium, theUK ‘Defence’ Secretary Geoff Hoon told the House of Commons in 2003 that therewas “not the slightest scientific evidence” to suggest that depleted uraniumleft a poisonous residue.57 This is breathtaking, inhumane, mendacious claptrap,as Hoon must know. He, like Tony Blair, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and HomeSecretary David Blunkett, are, in my view, beyond words. They are an insult tothe principles on which their Labour Party was created and has long-sincediscarded to serve the Illuminati agenda. Professor Doug Rokke is a former USarmy colonel and director of the Pentagon’s depleted uranium project. He saysthat the military cannot just contaminate any other nation, cause harm itspeople and environment and then ignore the consequences of what they have done.He called on the US and UK to “recognise the immoral consequences of theiractions and assume responsibility for medical care and thorough environmentalremediation”.58But they won’t because they don’t care about the consequences for troops orcivilians, only that the outcome suits their plans. The UN Environment Programmefound that the depleted uranium used by the US and UK in the Balkans had reachedthe water table and seven years after the conflict it recommended thedecontamination of buildings to protect the civilian population against cancer.But there’s no evidence is there, Mr Goon? Depleted uranium is standard in anumber of anti-tank weapons and is also contained in bullets, shells and bombs.The so-called bunker busters used in Baghdad contain seven tonnes of depleteduranium alone and one of these was used in the “attempt to kill Saddam Hussein”when a restaurant was targeted. This alone would have contaminated a largecivilian area with depleted uranium and that is just one bomb.59 Experts suggestthat between 1,000 and 2,000 tonnes of depleted uranium were used by thecoalition in the three-week conflict compared with 340 tonnes in 1991 – and lookat the consequences of that.60 Saul Bloom is executive director of Arc Ecology,a San Francisco-based non-profit organisation that has helped foreigngovernments analyse the environmental impacts of US military bases. He says ofthe uranium pollution: “Post-war environmental deaths may exceed direct civiliancasualties.” 61 Thus we can observe both the consequences for the Iraqi peopleof being ‘liberated’ and the almost unimaginable sickness of the soul it takesto plan such suffering simply to increase your own power. Yet these are theminds that control our world. For how much longer are we going to let them??Medal if you kill, jail of you don’tEvents may appear to be topsy-turvy and Alice in Wonderland, but that’s only ifyou are looking for logical explanations based on the world the people areconditioned to believe in. The common theme that finds the logical in theapparently inexplicable is a simple question: is it good for the agenda? Forexample, it does not appear logical or consistent to arm Saddam Hussein withchemical and biological weapons and then for the same people to use his allegedpossession of such weapons to invade his country. But it suited the agenda bothto arm Iraq before the Gulf War in 1991 and then to invade in 2003 using theUS-supplied ‘weapons of mass destruction’ as the excuse. To the manipulatorsthere is nothing contradictory in that at all. It is simply the way the game isplayed. If you kill people while wearing a uniform they give you a medal and ifyou do the same in jeans and a T-shirt they give you a life sentence. Soldiersare called “heroes” for killing civilians and jailed if they refuse to do so.This, again, is perfectly logical because the Illuminati want their troops tokill people. They don’t want their fodder in uniform using their own minds andconscience and refusing to be involved in murder. Two British soldiers faced upto two years in prison for refusing to fight in Iraq because they would not takepart in a conflict in which civilians would be killed. The two men, thought tobe a private and an air technician with the 16 Air Assault Brigade, were sentback to their barracks and a third was preparing for a court martial after hewould not travel to Iraq.Stephen Eagle Funk, a 20-year-old US marine reserve, also refused to be sent toIraq to take part in a war he believed was “immoral because of the deceptioninvolved by our leaders”.62 He said he would rather take the punishment now thanlive with what he would have to do in Iraq for the rest of his life: “I would begoing in knowing that it was wrong and that would be hypocritical.” 63 He faceda possible court martial and time in a military prison for his action. But he isa true military hero. As Mark Twain said: “It is curious that physical courageshould be so common in the world and moral courage so rare.” Like increasingnumbers of young soldiers, Funk only joined the military to have his collegefees paid and because “the ads make the armed forces look so cool – ‘call thisnumber and we’ll send you a free pair of boxer shorts’. A lot of kids had noidea what was involved”, he said.64 He was soon to find out: “Every day incombat training you had to yell out ‘Kill! Kill!’ and we would get into troubleif you didn’t shout it out, so often I would just mouth it so I didn’t get intotrouble.” 65 He said that recruits were encouraged to hurt each other inhand-to-hand combat training. “I couldn’t do that so they would pair me up withsomeone who was very violent or aggressive.” 66 When the instructor told him hehad an attitude problem he could not keep quiet any longer:> “I was a little pissed off and I said, ‘I think killing people is wrong.’ That> was the crystallising moment because I had never said it out loud before. It> was such a relief. It’s a lot easier if you just give in and don’t question> authority.” 67 He said he had spoken out to warn other young people about the manipulations ofthe military:> “War is about destruction and violence and death. It is young men fighting old> men’s wars. It is not the answer; it just ravages the land of the> battleground. I know it’s wrong but other people in the military have been> programmed to think it is OK. All they [the military] want is numbers. What> I’m doing is really trying to educate people to weigh their options – there> are so many more ways to get money for school.” 68 Albert Einstein put it so well: “The pioneers of a warless world are the youthwho refuse military service.”Pawns in uniform, oops, sorry, “our troops”The irony is that the troops who bombard these countries with their lethalweaponry causing such death and destruction are themselves considered to beexpendable fodder by the Illuminati. The war criminal, Henry Kissinger, a majorIlluminati front man for more than 40 years, said: “Military men are dumb,stupid animals to be used as pawns for foreign policy.” 69 They are portrayed asheroes when they go to war and they are hailed as even greater heroes if theydie for the Illuminati, or “the cause of freedom and liberation”. But once theyare dead, or if they are maimed for life or develop war-related disease likeGulf War Syndrome, they will be ignored and cast aside, even publicly condemned.My father served with the Army Medical Corps in the Second World War and he toldme from an early age about the reality of war. He told me how young kids, stillin their teens, would be brought back from battle with horrendous injuriesscreaming for their mothers thousands of miles away. He recalled how they wouldadd ballast inside the coffins to cover the fact that there was so little leftof the person inside. He also told me how military doctors would bend the rulesto get people enlisted into the military at wartime when they had medicalproblems that should have prevented this. Then, when they returned injured inmind or body, the same doctors would follow the rules to the letter to stoplegitimate compensation. I wrote a poem about this that you will find inAppendix II [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1790964].Typical of this attitude was the experience of Lianne Seymour, a mother of ayoung child, whose husband, Ian, died in a helicopter crash in Iraq. Soon afterhis death she received a letter from the British Ministry of ‘Defence’ sayingthat she would have to vacate her military home and repay nine days of hissalary that had been paid since his death. When the story broke in thenewspapers the Blair gang did what they always do when the truth is out. Theylied and blamed it all on the man at the ministry who sent the letter. Theydescribed it as a “mistake” and said it was not policy to do this. It turns outthat this is exactly what the policy is. I don’t know why she should be made tosuffer further, but Lianne Seymour was invited to meet Defence Secretary, GeoffHoon, as he sought to offset the bad publicity. He said she would not have torepay the nine days pay or move out of the house. She said of the meeting: “It’scompletely disappointing. I think his words were that I’m not going to live inluxury but at least I’m not going to be poor, which I just think is terrible.”70 The men who sent her husband to war while never seeing a bullet firedthemselves, will of course, continue to live in luxury. Some 200,000 soldierswho took part in the Gulf War of 1991 complained of pain, sickness, skinproblems, loss of memory and concentration – the symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome.The average payment in compensation for the loss of their long-term health is,according to campaigner Joyce Riley, about $98 a month.71 Some 60,000 have hadcompensation claims rejected by the Pentagon. Riley said the pathetic payment“basically washes the DOD’s hands; they can say ‘look, we are compensating’”.72Major General Smedley Butler was twice awarded the Medal of Honor while servingfor more than 30 years in the United States Marine Corps. He encapsulated thereal nature of war and the military in a speech in July 1933 in which he saidthat war is just a racket conducted by the very few at the expense of masses andthat only a small group on the inside knows what it is really all about. He wenton:> “Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my> own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended> animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with> everyone in the military service. I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico,> safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent> place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the> raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall> Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown> Brothers in 1909—1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American> sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went> its way unmolested.” 73 Nothing changes. The Project for the New American Century document says that theUS must “fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars” asa “core mission”. Put another way, large numbers of US troops are going to bekilled and horrifically injured to give these crackpots their global control.Donald Rumsfeld told the troops involved in the Iraq horror: “With theliberation of Iraq, you have transformed the country, but how you did it willtransform how we defend our country in the 21st century.” Yep, he really said,“defend”. What he means is the policy of “first strike defence” (attack) will beused to invade the neo-Nazi shopping list of target countries and a lot oftroops are going to die and be maimed for life. All the troops cheered when hesaid that and treated Rumsfeld like some sort of god. It’s the same wheneverPresident Village Idiot reads his spinner-prepared speeches to the pawns inuniform. They cheer the ‘leaders’ who see the troops as nothing more than cattleto be used as necessary. It is so pathetic to watch. When Bush talked to troopsabout their colleagues who died in Iraq, he said:> “No one who falls will be forgotten by this grateful nation. We honor their> service to America and we pray their families will receive God’s comfort and> God’s grace.” Those words were delivered by a practicing Satanist who knows that the troopsare only there to be used and abused as required by the agenda he serves. It’sjust another script for the movie. The true scale of military casualties and thenature of their injuries are suppressed for the same reason as civiliancasualties are not emphasised. It’s bad for the movie version of war and thereasons behind it. An American neurosurgeon, Gene Bolles, told his localnewspaper in Boulder, Colorado, how the daily “White House press briefings andfuzzy real-time TV reports fall far short of conveying the brutality of war”.74Bolles treated military casualties at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center inGermany, where he has been chief of neurosurgery for 16 years. He said:> “It really is disgustingly sanitized on television …we have had a number of> really horrific injuries now from the war. They have lost arms, legs, hands;> they have been burned; they have had significant brain injuries and peripheral> nerve damage. These are young kids that are going to be, in some regards,> changed for life. I don’t feel that people realize that … these are young> children; 18, 19, 20 with arms and legs blown off. That is the reality.” 75 A message to “our troops”British Prime Minister Tony Blair had such contempt for the families of two deadsoldiers that he said at a news conference with George Bush that they had beenexecuted by the Iraqis. This was based, as usual with Blair, on no evidencewhatsoever, but it suited the moment to indicate that this had happened. Thefamilies were devastated because the military had told them the men had beenkilled in action and Blair was forced to make a public apology for the grief hisspinning had caused. “Support our troops”, they tell us while they “exploit ourtroops”, even after they are dead. For goodness sake, get out of the forcesbefore you are the next victim of these insane criminals. You are not liberatinganyone; you are helping to complete the global fascist state that you and yourchildren will have to live in. Many former soldiers in the US and British armieshave contacted me over the years to say they now realise how they have been usedand there are multi-millions in the military today who have no earthly clue whythey are killing people. One teenage American soldier in Iraq called “PrivateAJ” told a CNN reporter: “I wanna get in there and get my nose dirty, I wannatake revenge for 9/11.” The reporter pointed out there was no evidence to linkthe Iraqi government with September 11th. Private AJ pushed his tongue out tothe end of his chin and replied: “Yeah, well that stuff’s way over my head.” 76According to a New York Times/CBS News survey, 42 per cent of the Americanpublic also believed that Saddam Hussein was directly responsible for theSeptember 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. An ABC Newspoll said that 55 per cent of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein directlysupports al-Qaeda.77The graphic descriptions in this chapter don’t even begin to portray the truemagnitude of the horror those people suffered and, for the ones who survived,continue to suffer. If people don’t understand what ‘war’ really means behindthe flag waving and victory parades they will go on supporting the sick mindsthat are planning to repeat the experience in country after country across theworld. This is no time for mincing words and playing softly, softly. We need tolook this in the face and deal with it. Those in uniform, “our troops”, who killpeople to order – “three Iraqi’s to go, please, heavy on the ammo” – are not“heroes”. They are paid assassins guilty of mass murder.And it’s time someone said it.SOURCES > 1 “The Rape of Iraq” by Dr Susan Block, http://www.drsusanblock.com> [http://www.drsusanblock.com]> 2 www.davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com]> 3 “The ugly truth of America’s Camp Cropper, a story to shame us all”, by> Robert Fisk, UK Independent, July 22nd 2003,> http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/story.jsp?story=426520> [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/story.jsp?story=426520]> 4 “Why I Quit the Sun”, The Guardian, March 31st 2003> 5 Ibid> 6 Ibid> 7 “MSNBC’s Banfield Slams War Coverage”, April 29th 2003; her full lecture can> be seen at http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=15778> [http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=15778]> 8 Ibid> 9 Ibid> 10 Ibid> 11 “Screams and Cries Echo in Hospitals”, by Samia Nakhoul, Reuters, April 7th> 2003> 12 BBC News Online, April 14th, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2947809.stm> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2947809.stm]> 13 Ibid, April 15th 2003,> http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2945655.stm> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2945655.stm]> 14 ABC News Online, April 3rd 2003,> http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s823972.htm> [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s823972.htm]> 15 Ibid> 16 Arab News, http://www.arabnews.com/ [http://www.arabnews.com/]> 17 “In Iraqi Hospitals, Child War Casualties Mount”, by Samia Nakhoul,> Reuters, April 3rd 2003> 18 Ibid> 19 Ibid> 20 “US Marines Turn Fire On Civilians At ‘The Bridge Of Death’”, by Mark> Franchetti, Sunday Times, March 30th 2003> 21 “The Saddest Story of All”, by Anton Antonowicz, Daily Mirror, April 5th> 2003> 22 “Screams and Cries Echo in Hospitals”, by Samia Nakhoul, Reuters, April 7th> 2003> 23 “This is the reality of war.

The star of one of their Iraqi productions was19-year-old Private Jessica Lynch, from Palestine, West Virginia, who joined themilitary to have her college fees paid because she wanted to be a kindergartenteacher. The college fee sting was highlighted in an excellent BBC documentary Isaw. The military are now so desperate to recruit more troops to “fight anddecisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars as a core mission” thatthey are targeting and militarising schools, especially those of the poor andminorities, and enticing them into the military with the promise of paying theircollege fees. Once they sign on the line, however, these kids become liable tobe deployed in war zones. So it was with Jessica Lynch.Jessica found herself in Iraq working as a supply clerk with the Army’s 507thMaintenance Company. She was captured when her unit made a wrong turn nearNasiriya and was ambushed. Oh, what a frenzy of Hollywood scriptwriting explodedfrom the Pentagon for the media to feed upon. Mitchell Catlin, an Australiancorrespondent, even called her “Private Ryan”, the Demi Moore character, in onereport.1 The mistake was understandable because that was the way she wasportrayed. “Belying her country-girl smile and petite 5-foot-5 frame, Lynch putup a Rambo-worthy fight when her unit, the Army’s 507th Ordnance MaintenanceCo., came under attack, according to a new report”, screamed one paper. Lynchopened fire on the Iraqi assailants, picking them off one by one until she ranout of ammunition, reported the Washington Post. Wow. She had continued shooting– even after she was shot and stabbed and her unit members were killed allaround her. “She was fighting to the death”, a US official told the Post. “Shedid not want to be taken alive.”2 Er, so how come that after doing this to her“assailants”, those nasty Iraqis didn’t kill her when she ran out of ammunition?And how come she had no bullet or stab wounds?? Do you think US troops wouldhave spared her in the same circumstances?The reports said that Lynch had been shot, stabbed and tortured and the publicwere told what a great American little Jessie was. All this happened at a timewhen the authorities were being criticised for the way the war was going.However, the Iraqi doctors who treated her told a very different story about the“gun slinging, shot and stabbed” heroine. They said that she suffered fracturesto her arms and lower limbs and a “small skull wound”, sustained when hervehicle overturned. Her American doctors said she had fractures in her upperright arm, upper left leg, lower left leg and right ankle and foot. Her father,Greg Lynch Sr., told reporters she had no penetration wounds. “It was a roadtraffic accident”, said Haitham Gizzy, a physician at the hospital at Nasiriyawho treated Lynch for her injuries. “There was not a drop of blood … there wereno bullets or shrapnel or anything like that.” Bryan Whitman, the US AssistantSecretary of Defense, said: “I’m not going to get into the specific injuriesthat she sustained; that’s up to her and her doctors to discuss at theappropriate time.”3 Like never. Discussing her injuries was not a problem,however, when they were telling us she was stabbed and shot. At the hospital, DrHaitham Gizzy said, “She was given special care, more than the Iraqi patients.”4Harith al-Houssona, another doctor who treated Lynch, said: “She was veryfrightened when she woke up and she kept saying: ‘Please don’t hurt me, don’ttouch me.’ I told her that she was safe, she was in a hospital and that I was adoctor, and I never hurt a patient.”5 He said he went outside the hospitalduring the bombing to get supplies of her favourite drink, orange juice, andstruggled to persuade her to eat. The doctor said that Iraqi intelligenceofficers told the hospital that Private Lynch would soon be transferred toBaghdad, but instead he told an ambulance driver to deliver her to one of theAmerican outposts that had already been established on the outskirts of thecity. “But when he reached their checkpoint, the Americans fired at him”, hesaid.6You mean the Pentagon told us a pack of lies? Never. But Hollywood wasn’tfinished yet. The day after the Iraqi ambulance driver had tried to deliverPrivate Lynch to US troops only to be fired upon, she was “rescued” from herIraqi hospital bed, we were told, in a daring raid by a team of Navy Seals,Marine commandos, Air Force pilots and Army Rangers working with US SpecialForces. It was the first time an American Prisoner of War was freed from behindenemy lines in half a century, the media trumpeted. But once again the Iraqidoctors who were there tell a rather different tale. “They made a big show”,said Lynch’s doctor, Haitham Gizzy. “It was just a drama, a big, dramaticshow.”7 Gizzy and other doctors said that there were no Iraqi soldiers ormilitiamen at the hospital when the US Special Operations forces arrived intheir helicopters. Most of Saddam’s Fedayeen Fighters and the entire Ba’athParty leadership had fled. There was no one at the hospital when the troopsarrived, he said, only doctors. Dr Hassan and others on duty that evening saidthey heard a “big thumping” near the hospital and the sound of helicopters andtanks before the soldiers began to enter the hospital. He said the doctorsagreed to stay in one room and not to intervene while the soldiers broke downseveral doors in the hospital before locating Lynch. US soldiers videotaped therescue, but among the many scenes not shown to the press at US Central Commandin Doha, Qatar, was one of four doctors who were handcuffed and interrogated,together with two civilian patients, one of whom was immobile and connected to adrip. “They were doctors, with stethoscopes round their necks”, Dr Harith said,“Even in war, a doctor should not be treated like that.”8 Hardly the story thePentagon wanted to pedal. “What the Americans say is like the story of Sinbadthe Sailor – it’s a myth”, said Dr Harith al-Houssona. “They said that there wasno medical care in Iraq and that there was a very strong defence of thishospital, but there was no one here apart from doctors and patients, and therewas nobody to fire at them.”9 The doctor said that the troops cut open a bedspecially designed for patients with bed sores that Private Lynch had beenusing. “They took samples of sand out of it”, Dr Harith said. “It was the onlybed like it that we have, the only one in the governorate.”10 He said he feltsad that he would never see Jessica again, but he felt happy that she was happyand had gone back to her life. “If I could speak to her I would say:‘Congratulations!’” he said. Terrible people these Iraqis aren’t they?Diplomatic amnesiaUnfortunately, according to the US government’s broadcasting arm, Fox/Fix Newsand others, Jessica Lynch could not remember what happened to her either whenshe was captured or during her time at the hospital.11 A US official said: “Shebasically has amnesia, and has mentally blocked out the horrible things westrongly believe she went through.”12 Mmmm. Fox News reported that militarypsychiatrists had been talking to her. I bet they had. It must have been astrangely delayed amnesia because there was apparently no sign of it until shewas in the hands of her fellow Americans at the Walter Reed Army Medical Centerin Washington. According to her doctor, Isadore Rosenfeld, she began to sufferfrom a condition called Total Global Amnesia.13 Later they said that she was notsuffering from amnesia, she just couldn’t remember! It was unlikely, they said,that she ever would.14 Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense,said he knew there was some “conflicting information out there, but in due timethe full story will be told, I’m sure”.15 But not by you, mate. Thankfully, andto her credit, Lynch’s memory did ‘return’ and she said in November 2003 thatthe official version of her capture and rescue was make-believe. What the Iraqidoctors said was true and basically the Pentagon version and the truth was likecomparing the mind of Einstein with that of President Village Idiot. Far from aRambo response, her gun jammed and she did not fire a single bullet. Themilitary awarded Lynch the Bronze Star for meritorious combat service, aPrisoner of War medal and the Purple Heart, which is usually awarded to thosewounded in combat.While Jessica Lynch and her rescuers were being hailed across the front pages,what of her fellow patients in that Iraqi hospital? Among them, the doctorssaid, were many civilians, including children, being treated in crowded wardsfor severed limbs and deep lacerations caused by US tank fire and bombs duringthe opening week of the ‘war’. The doctors estimated that some 300 civilianswere killed in Nasiriya and 1,000 wounded.Not counting the lossesThe war propaganda was not only involved in suppressing the extent of the deathand injury suffered by civilians. It also worked to keep secret the number ofsoldiers who died. This is always the case because the lower the perceivedcasualties, civilian and military, the more support there will be for the nextwar. Dr Waiel S.H. Awwad, a Syrian war correspondent with Al Arabiya television,a part of Middle East Broadcasting Corporation, went missing in Iraq for ninedays before making contact with his family. He told Asian News International howhe was an “embedded” reporter with a US maintenance division when they wereambushed 20 kilometres north of Basra on their way to the town of Zuber. He saidthat he and his film crew were taken to the local headquarters of SaddamHussein’s Ba’ath Party before a compassionate tribal leader arranged for theirescape. While he was there, he said, he saw 20 British troops killed in Zuber,but the authorities only announced two:> “… I saw it with my own eyes, three tanks were blown [up], three vehicles were> blown [up] and six prisoners of war were caught. Now who could give such facts> from the ground if we were not there.” 16 He also described how the fierce fighting the ‘coalition’ forces faced in theearly stages was underplayed by the western media. The lies told by the Americanmilitary and people like Rumsfeld with regard to the unfolding military campaignwere even highlighted by some mainstream organisations like the BBC, so blatantdid they become. How many troops have been killed and injured in Iraq? Wecertainly can’t trust the authorities to tell us, but what happened inAfghanistan might give us an idea. Mohammed Daud Miraki, the author of PerpetualDeath From America,17 claims that American losses in Afghanistan alone are farhigher than admitted. In March 2003, he estimated the number of dead US soldiersin Afghanistan at 1,200 and they are still being killed, as are Afghan civiliansin far greater numbers as that conflict continues out of the headlines. Mirakisays the US does not reveal the military losses in Afghanistan because they wantto appear invincible as a military force. The US wanted to envisage theirmilitary might, he says, as a force that even the great guerrilla fighters fromAfghanistan could not muster the skills needed to hinder their impeccablemilitary machine. But in fact, he claims, the US military had lost many soldiersby March 2003:> “According to various intelligence agencies, the US has lost over 1,200> soldiers in Afghanistan. The Russian intelligence agency put the figure of> dead in the first six months of the war at 373 dead and 585 critically> injured. Meanwhile, reports from other intelligence agencies including Iranian> and Indian among others put the number of dead US soldiers to be over 600 in> the first year, and after 18 months, they report the figure of US losses over> 1,200 and 1,500 critically wounded.” 18 At the start of the war, he wrote, “the corpses of US soldiers were transportedto Jacobabad and Dalbudin Air Bases in Pakistan and the country’s Frontier Postnewspaper reported how 45 US troops were killed on just one day during a landoperation near Kandahar. It further reported that 26 dead commandos have beendelivered to the US-leased military base near the Pakistani town ofJacobabad.”19The IRNA news agency reported on December 2nd 2001 that 124 dead USsoldiers were transported from Pakistan to the US:> “The bodies of 124 American troops have been flown back home in a cargo plane> on November 29 [2001], claimed a local daily here on Sunday … The Pakistan> Observer reported that the troops were killed during clashes with Taliban> Fighters when they had landed in Helmand province to help the ex-governor of> Kandahar Gul Agha’s Lashkar Fighters against Taliban.” 20 Miraki said he was personally aware of the US losses in Helmand in which fourApache Helicopters were also shot down. Andrei Sukhozhilov, a reporter connectedwith the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), wrote how he had obtainedinformation about casualties from Khanabad Air Base in southern Uzbekistan.“Uzbek sources at Khanabad suggest that the real figures of US casualties arefar higher than the Pentagon’s official totals,” 21 he said, and he went on:> “Uzbek army personnel working at the air base said scores of US casualties> have been arriving there. From November 25 to December 2 [2001], an Uzbek> orderly working with American medical staff said he had witnessed the arrival> of four to five US helicopters – carrying between them 10-15 American> casualties – each day … > “… An Uzbek pilot spoke of the death last week of an American soldier who he> had become friendly with while he was on the base. The US serviceman, he said,> had died in the attempt to end the prison riot on the outskirts of> Mazar-e-Sharif two weeks ago. ‘A lot of American troops died there – it was a> real battle’, the pilot said.” 22 For sure you will find the same story in Iraq and all wars orchestrated by thesere-writers of reality.Embedded to deceiveIlluminati control of the mainstream media ensured that pretty much the onlystory the public received was the official version from the Bush cartel. A studyby the Washington-based Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting revealed that 76 percent of the guests on network talk shows in late January and early February 2003were current or former government officials while those speaking against the waraccounted for less than one per cent.23 This is how the game works across theworld. You emphasise the ‘information’ that supports your view and suppress thatwhich challenges it. When you complain that only one side of the debate is beinggiven, the media say: “No, no, we had a guy on speaking against the war a weeklast Thursday.” Very important to the required slant are the news agencies thatsupply ‘news’ to all media outlets throughout the world. These are owned, ofcourse, by the Illuminati. For instance the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, friend ofthe Bushes and owner of the Washington Times, bought the newswire UPI.24 Theconnections are endless. The British media cannot, with some exceptions, beconfused with real journalism, but it is still light years ahead of the Americanversion. The bias on networks like CNN and Murdoch’s Fox News are simplysickening. Robert Fisk, the outstanding journalist on the UK Independent,described American journalism as increasingly “vapid, hopeless, gutless,unchallenging” since 9/11.25 Having spent a great deal of time in the UnitedStates since the mid-1990s, the only point I would question is the bit about“since 9/11”, although it did certainly worsen after that.It was the Pentagon’s idea to have ‘embedded reporters’, in other wordsjournalists assigned to military units during the war. Does anyone believe thatthis was done because the Pentagon wanted the truth to be told? Can elephantsfly? They said the policy had “worked well” or, more accurately, worked well inmanaging the news. Many times I heard reporters talking about “we” did this or“we are doing this” when what they meant was the military with whom they were‘embedded’. The British ITN correspondent, Bill Neely, wearing full militarycombat gear and standing in a transport aircraft, told viewers: “We have justthis second crossed the border into Iraq. We’ll be landing at our target inabout ten minutes time.” Our target? The idea is that you keep the journalistswhere you want them, feed them the story you want them to tell, and you get themso close to the troops on whom they depend to survive that they loseobjectivity. That is largely what happened. NBC News correspondent David Bloom,who died of a blood clot in his lung, told his audience: “[The soldiers] havedone anything and everything that we could ask of them, and we in turn aretrying to return the favor by doing anything and everything that they can ask ofus.”26 The British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, said the imagery the embeddedjournalists broadcast was at least partially responsible for the public’s changeof mood in supporting the war.27 Almost 100 camera crews were ‘embedded’ with USunits and when they needed even more positive images the military shot thepictures themselves and released them to the networks. They showed them like thelap dogs they are. Robert Jensen, a journalism professor at the University ofTexas, pointed out that ‘embedding’ meant following the rules dictated by themilitary:> “Those rules said reporters could not travel independently (which meant they> could not really report independently), interviews had to be on the record> (which meant lower-level service members were less likely to say anything> critical), and officers could censor copy and temporarily restrict electronic> transmissions for ‘operational security’ (which, in practice, could be defined> as whatever field commanders want to censor.” 27 CentConAn excellent BBC documentary in the Correspondent series highlighted themanipulation of journalists by the political and military spinners.28 Itrevealed how journalists assembling with British forces in Kuwait were orderednot to report what they saw. Tom Copetas of Bloomberg Television said:> “We were not allowed to take any pictures or describe British soldiers> carrying guns. I was told that there was a decision made by Downing Street> that the military minders of the journalists down there were to go to any> lengths not to portray the British fighting men and women as fighters. They> wanted to have them there as ‘nation builders’. The media monitors would get> very, very upset with you very fast and threats were levelled against you that> you would be disembedded.”29 The 700 journalists at CentCom military command in Qatar were supposed to bethere to get the ‘big picture’ from those running the war hundreds of miles fromwhere the bullets were flying. Instead they were played like a violin. TheCorrespondent programme showed a list on the wall of the British military mediaoffice at CentCom. The list was headed “Poo Traps” and reminded the spokesmen ofthe subjects to avoid in interviews with journalists. These included “depleteduranium”, “bombing accuracy” and “market bombings”. Don’t talk about anythingthat the public have a right to know; only say what is good for the image youare trying to give them. Paul Hunter of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporationsaid: “At the end of the day when you try to make a news story out of whateverhappens here, you still have to use their message track, the one thing they aregoing to answer to every single question and it has gone on every single day.”30 Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense, said in a briefingpaper to his war spinners that “shaping world opinion was priority numberone”.31 Despite this blatant bias, the British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon,had the audacity to say that people should be sceptical about reports that donot come from official sources.32The American networks were given the front seats in the daily CentCom‘briefings’ (of lies), then came journalists from the ‘allies’, with the othersat the back. The spinners watched from the sidelines gesturing to the spokesmen,usually the unbelievably arrogant General Vincent Brooks. Both the Bush WhiteHouse and Blair’s Downing Street sent representatives to CentCom to spin ontheir behalf. Bush’s guy was Jim Wilkinson. He looked straight out of highschool and was definitely in the Vincent Brooks class of undiluted arrogance.Wilkinson is a civilian, but insisted on prancing around CentCom throughout thewar in a military uniform even though the only action he had any chance ofseeing, was on the bank of TV screens. He looked like a refugee fromMasturbators Anonymous. At one ‘briefing’ Michael Wolf of the New York Magazineasked Brooks “the question that every reporter was asking, not just every day,but literally every minute”.33 It was this: “Why should we stay, what’s thevalue to us of what we learn at this million dollar press centre?” The questionbrought applause from other journalists equally sick of being manipulated.Brooks replied: “It’s your choice; we want to provide information that’struthful from the operational headquarters that is running this war.” A lie, Mr.Brooks, yet another one. Michael Wolf told the Correspondent documentary whathappened next:> “I was approached by a guy named Wilkinson. He was a civilian, also he was> wearing a uniform, which was odd and I said ‘aren’t you a civilian?’ He said> ‘I’m in the Reserves’. I said, ‘but you’re not here in the Reserves’. He said> ‘right, right’. So I said so you’re a kind of paramilitary. So we immediately> got off to the wrong foot. He said ‘this is fucking war asshole. Don’t fuck> around with things you don’t understand’. And then finally it was ‘no more> questions for you, why don’t you just go home?’” 34 This is how journalists are intimidated into line. Play by our rules or you’reout of the loop. The rules included pressure not to ask follow up questions thatwould expose the lies of the official statements by Brooks and General TommyFranks. Wilkinson told the BBC: “If people didn’t like the way we handled it, Iwould think, one part of it, just a plain case of too bad, and the secondprobably a little envy on the part of those who were not embedded. The realsuperstars of this war were the ones who were embedded.” And that is what war isto these idiots: a Hollywood production. The same with many of the ‘superstars’of the television networks. They are more concerned with their parting andprofile than ever they are with facts. True to their Orwellian methodology theCentCom ‘briefings’ – the “platform for truth” in the words of General TommyFranks – were used to tell a stream of lies. As I have been saying for more thana decade, it’s all a mind game and no trick is missed. The backdrop for thisdaily deception was built at a cost to American taxpayers of $200,000 by GeorgeAllison, one of Hollywood’s leading art directors.35 He designed the set forABC’s Good Morning America and has worked with MGM and Disney. He was also freshfrom his latest Michael Douglas film, It Runs in the Family. Allison, who hasdesigned White House backdrops for President Bush and, very appropriately,worked with the illusionist David Blaine, was flown into Qatar as part of areputed one million dollar conversion of a storage hangar into a high-tech hubfor the international media.36 As one report said of the set:> “Gone are the easel and chart, solitary television and VCR machine with which> General Norman Schwarzkopf showed fuzzy images of smart-bomb raids during the> 1991 Gulf War. On a set that will become instantly recognisable, generals will> present updates from two podiums at the front of a stage adorned with five> 50in plasma screens and two 70in television projection screens ready to show> maps, graphics and videos of action. > “Behind them will be a soft-focus elongated map of the world, as if to suggest> that the world is united behind them. The set was built in Chicago and> reputedly shipped over by Federal Express at a cost of $47,000 (£29,000).” 37 While the troops go to war on their victims, their masters go to war on thepublic mind. We are experiencing a world described so eloquently by GeorgeOrwell. It is a world that is about image, not substance, and one in which liesare truth, war is peace and dictatorship is liberation. The Newspeak, the falseenemies, the presentation of fascism as freedom, are all in Orwell’s predictionsfor the society we are now living in.Too dangerous to investigateA number of non-embedded journalists, known as “independents” or “unilaterals”were killed or injured while covering the war independently of the military.This suited the authorities because the fewer of those types of reporters to bedeployed in future conflicts the better it is for those who want to controlinformation. “See, it is very dangerous, so stay with us and you’ll be fine ifyou follow the rules.” US spokesman Jim Wilkinson said of the independentjournalists: “They were a pain in our rear a lot of times. They would turn up onthe battlefield despite our warnings.” Richard Sambrook, head of BBC News, saidhe would have liked more non-embedded journalists, but it was just “toodangerous”. Funny how so many non-embedded reporters died in such a short war.Ten journalists were killed including ITN’s Terry Lloyd, who was shot byAmerican troops in a vehicle clearly marked ‘TV’. Ironically, he was only atthat location because the military spokesmen had lied about the “fall” of theport town of Umm Qasr. That had been Lloyd’s original destination before thefalse information was fed to the media. The town actually “fell” some 17 daysafter the mendacious military claimed it was taken.A US tank attacked the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, the base of the internationaljournalists, killing two cameramen and injuring three others. There is no waythis was a mistake and nor was it, as the ludicrous US military claimed, inretaliation for shots coming from the hotel. Strange how no one in a hotel fullof journalists saw or heard any such shooting. Anyway, are these prats inuniform really saying that in response to small arms fire from a hotel full ofpeople you just blast tank shells at the building? It was planned, of course itwas, and the same with the missile attacks (sorry accidents) on Arab televisionfacilities in Baghdad in which a journalist from al- Jazeera died. Thejournalists were killed and injured in daylight at locations known to thePentagon to be media sites. The manipulation of information through the media istheir greatest weapon for the control of the people and they don’t want anymaverick independents telling the truth they don’t want the public to hear. Two‘non-embedded’ journalists told Arab News of their outrageous treatment at thehands of American troops.38 Luis Castro and Victor Silva, both reporters workingfor RTP Portuguese television, were held for four days. They said they werebeaten, had their equipment, vehicle and video tapes confiscated, and were thenescorted out of Iraq by the 101st Airborne Division. This was despite holdingthe proper Unilateral Journalist accreditation issued by the Coalition ForcesCentral Command. Castro said:> “I have covered 10 wars in the past six years – in Angola, Afghanistan, Zaire> and East Timor. I have been arrested three times in Africa, but have never> been subjected to such treatment or been physically beaten before. The> Americans call themselves liberators and freedom fighters, but look what they> have done to us.” 39 The pair had been to Umm Qasr and Basra and were travelling to Najaf when theywere stopped by the military police. Castro said accredited identification waschecked and they were given the all clear to proceed. “Suddenly, for no reason,the situation changed”, Castro told Arab News.40 The soldiers ordered them tolie on the ground, he said, and they stepped on their hands and backs andhandcuffed them. “The soldiers used our satellite phones to call their familiesat home”, Castro said, “I begged them to allow me to use my own phone to call myfamily, but they refused. When I protested, they pushed me to the ground andkicked me in the ribs and legs.” Castro said he believed they were detainedbecause they were not embedded with the US forces:> “Embedded journalists are always escorted by military minders. What they write> is controlled and, through them, the military feeds its own version of the> facts to the world. When independent journalists such as us come around, we> pose a threat because they cannot control what we write.” 41 Castro said a lieutenant in charge of the military police had told him: “My menare like dogs, they are trained only to attack, please try to understand.” 42What chance do the children in Iraq have, eh? One soldier, who Castro asked notbe identified, wrote out a note, which was shown to Arab News. It said: “I am sosorry that you had to endure such bad conditions, but remember that I care andpray you can forgive.” Castro said the US troops were “totally crazy” and histreatment was typical of the American attitude, as confirmed to him by Britishforces. The attitude was “shoot first and ask questions later.” 43Planting the evidenceOnce the liberation of Iraq had left the people without water or electricity andcaused tens of thousands to be killed and injured beyond words, the inevitablefollowed amid the devastation and chaos. Looting erupted on a massive scale,just as the Illuminati place men knew that it would. Iraqi banks were destroyedand with them went the life savings of untold numbers of Iraqis and theirfamilies. But this suited the manipulators perfectly because the more thefinancial system was dismantled, the easier it would be for the United States toreplace it with one in their own image. Businesses and homes of the Iraqi peoplewere looted and destroyed and the government buildings that had not been hit byUS and British bombing were looted and burned together with the files ofevidence exposing the links between Saddam Hussein’s regime and the very forcesthat had now arrived to take over. But despite all of this, somehow,miraculously, files were found by journalists in these buildings to link SaddamHussein with Osama bin Laden and to claim that the British Labour MP GeorgeGalloway took millions in back-hand payments from Saddam. Galloway just happenedto be one of the most vociferous campaigners against the war. I have never metGalloway and I did not care at all for his public support for Saddam Hussein,but finding the evidence against him so easily in such circumstances isextremely convenient and typical of the way these guys operate. Galloway said:> “… The government enlisted the Murdoch press to launch an assault on me with> the journalistic equivalent of a cluster bomb. The central thrust of their> attacks, that I am a traitor not fit to sit in parliament, was scattered over> the Sun, News of the World, Times and Sunday Times ... That Tony Blair has> taken New Labour into the outer limits of social democratic politics, a kind> of twilight zone where, in the dimness, an axis of Bush, Blair, Berlusconi,> Aznar and Sharon can just be glimpsed, is pretty much a given. But his> alliance with the cheap jingo press, which is spreading racist hatred in this> conflict, is a key development in the war for Labour’s future. This latest> attack on me, for example, was fed to a willing press by Labour sources. I> know this because the national newspaper editor who was first offered the> ‘story’ (a transcript of a translated interview I gave to Abu Dhabi TV) turned> it down and alerted me. It was then given to the Sun. The transcribed words> were mine; the spin was all New Labour’s.” 44 The Arab satellite television company al-Jazeera also sacked its chiefexecutive, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, after his name appeared in a document ‘found’in the same way that appeared to link him with Iraqi intelligence. Al-Jazeerabroadcast horrendous pictures of Iraqi civilian casualties during the war thatwestern stations would not air. Convenient indeed that with so many files burnedand destroyed and amid such chaos, that the ‘evidence’ was found to incriminatepeople that Blair, Bush and Co wanted to destroy. The UK Guardian newspaperreported during the invasion of Afghanistan that journalists had described howthey were directed by the authorities to buildings in Kabul and other locationsto ‘find’ apparent proof of al-Qaeda’s involvement in the 9/11 hijackings. Thisincluded, the paper said, new box cutters still in their packaging and a freshlytorn page from an American magazine detailing Florida flying schools.45 Oh,please. This is what they think about the mentality of the media and, sureenough, these ‘finds’ were reported as if they were genuine. Investigativejournalist Wayne Madsen, a former naval officer and author of The Handbook ofPersonal Data Protection,46 produced an excellent analysis of such ‘evidence’ inthe Online Journal of April 29th 2003.47 He said that after the United Statesand Britain were shown to be providing bogus and plagiarized ‘intelligence’documents to the UN Security Council that supposedly ‘proved’ Saddam Hussein’sweapons of mass destruction programme, the world’s media was now being fed asteady stream of captured Iraqi ‘intelligence’ documents from the rubble ofIraq’s Mukhabarat intelligence headquarters. The problem with these documents,Madsen wrote, was that they were being provided by the US military to a fewreporters working for a “very suspect newspaper”, the London Daily Telegraph.The Sunday edition of the Telegraph on April 27th 2003 had reported how itscorrespondent in Baghdad, Inigo Gilmore, had been invited into the intelligenceheadquarters by US troops and miraculously ‘found’ amid the rubble a documentindicating that Iraq invited Osama bin Laden to visit Iraq in March 1998.Gilmore further reported that the CIA had been through the building severaltimes before he found the document and that the intelligence agency must have‘missed’ the document in their prior searches. This was an astounding claim,said Wayne Madsen, since the CIA must have been intimately familiar with thebuilding from their previous intelligence links with the Mukhabarat dating fromthe Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Also, the CIA and other intelligence agencies,including Britain’s MI-6, had refuted claims of a link between Osama bin Ladenand Iraq. Madsen wrote:> “Gilmore told the BBC that he noticed that on the Mukhabarat documents he> discovered some information that was ‘erased’. The erasures were apparently> made with a combination of black marker ink and correction fluid. He said he> scraped away at the paper with a razor and miraculously found the name bin> Laden in three places. The standard procedure for redacting a classified> document is to only use a black indelible marker to mask classified> information.

If a razor blade were used to scrape> away the markings, the indelible ink and the toner ink would be obliterated.> Gilmore’s claims appear to be spurious.” 48 This Iraqi-al-Qaeda ‘smoking gun’ was blasted across the news with the help ofthe CIA-Pentagon stooge, Ahmed Chalabi, head of the CIA-funded Iraqi NationalCongress. He told Murdoch’s Fox News that the document provided enoughinformation that Saddam Hussein was knowledgeable about the September 11thattacks on the United States. Once again the familiar names appear. Telegraphnewspapers were owned by the Hollinger Corporation of Conrad Black, who has beenfeatured in many of my books. He has been an extremely active member of theIlluminati Bilderberg Group (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and TheBiggest Secret for the detailed background). Hollinger owns the Jerusalem Post,a director of which is Richard Perle, the Pentagon advisor who was heavilyinvolved in plans for the war on Iraq. The National Interest, another pro-Bushpublication, was also funded by Black, who’s star has since fallen dramaticallyamid financial scandal.49 Perle’s friend, William Kristol, the chairman of theProject for the New American Century, appeared on Fox News to support thesignificance of the documents ‘found’ in Iraq. He said the exposure of Gallowayfor accepting money from Saddam Hussein was the “tip of the iceberg” andsuggested with no evidence at all that French President Jacques Chirac, otherWestern politicians and Arab journalists working for such networks asAl-Jazeera, would soon be ‘outed’ by further Iraqi intelligence documents.50 Hewas right about Al-Jazeera, so how did he know that was going to happen? FoxNews also said that Galloway might have given classified satellite imagery toal-Qaeda, again with no evidence presented to support the slander. This wasWayne Madsen’s summary of how he believes the propaganda works:> “Phoney documents are ‘dropped’ into the hands of a right-wing London> newspaper owned by Conrad Black. They are amplified by Black’s other holdings,> including the Jerusalem Post and Chicago Sun-Times. The story is then picked> up by the worldwide television outlets of News Corporation, Time Warner,> Disney and General Electric and echoed on the right-wing radio talk shows of> Clear Channel and Viacom. Political careers are damaged or destroyed. There is> no right of rebuttal for the accused. They are guilty as charged by a whipped> up public that gets its information from the Orwellian telescreens of the> corporate media … The media operating in concert with political vermin to whip> up popular opinion to stamp out criticism is nothing new. It was practiced by> Joseph Goebbels quite effectively in Nazi Germany.”51 The United States was keen to invite Telegraph reporters into the Iraqiintelligence headquarters, Madsen pointed out, and other documents ‘found’ byits reporters ‘revealed’ that Russian intelligence had passed intercepts of TonyBlair’s phone conversations to Iraqi intelligence; that German intelligenceoffered to assist Iraqi intelligence in the lead up to the war; and that Franceprovided Iraq with the contents of US-French diplomatic exchanges. All of these‘finds’ suited the agenda of the United States and Britain. Madsen said it wasamazing that the US military would be so open about letting favoured journalistswalk freely about the Mukhabarat building when the Pentagon has clamped tightsecurity on the Iraqi Oil Ministry. The reason for this was obvious, he wrote.While the Mukhabarat building could be salted with phoney intelligencedocuments, the Oil Ministry was likely to be rife with documents showing thelinks between Saddam Hussein and Dick Cheney’s company, Halliburton (see Alicein Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). Haliburton signed more than$73 million in contracts with Saddam’s government when Cheney was its chiefexecutive officer through two subsidiaries, Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll DresserPump Co, and this was part of the same UN oil-for-food programme involved in theallegations against George Galloway.52Destroying the evidenceThe worst of the (coordinated) looting frenzy after the American forces arrivedtargeted some of the most important and priceless artefacts and manuscriptsanywhere in the world at the Baghdad museums containing relics and documentationof human history going back to ancient Sumer (4000 to 2000 BC). This was alsopart of the information and knowledge spin. I have written extensively over theyears about the Illuminati bloodline connections to Sumer and Babylon and I willlater put that in context with current events. Enough to say for now that theIlluminati do not want their origins exposed and removing the evidence frompublic and academic view would be extremely important to them. Iraq is in theland of ancient Mesopotamia, the ‘Land Between the Rivers’, on the banks of theTigris and Euphrates. The Mesopotamians were the first known people to study thestars, develop the written word and enforce a legal code. It was, sayhistorians, the ‘cradle of civilisation’ and the location of the Biblical Gardenof Eden. The country’s museums, galleries and libraries were looted of theirfantastic contents from these ancient societies and torched into empty shellsalmost overnight while the American forces did nothing. Dr Moayad Damerji, theprofessor of archaeology at Baghdad University and the former director generalof the Iraqi Department of Antiquities, said the objects and artefacts chartinghuman development had vanished and their loss was immeasurable. “The IraqiNational Museum is the only museum in the world which shows all the steps in thehistory of mankind”, he said. “These witnesses to our own development have gone,they are gone.” 53 Among the most priceless treasures missing are the Vase ofUruk and the Harp of Ur, dating back to between 3000 and 2500 BC and the rule ofthe Sumerian kings (who connect into the Illuminati bloodlines, see The BiggestSecret and Children of the Matrix). The exquisite bronze Statue of Basitki fromthe Akkadian kingdom is also gone, removed despite its enormous weight. Theheads of stone statues were decapitated and precious inscribed tablets from thegreat Sumerian libraries lost – the very accounts of human history I havehighlighted in my books in connection to the Illuminati bloodlines. The tabletsrecord Sumerian history, life and belief, and almost certainly the origin of thebloodlines that rule the world today. It was the same story across the country.In Mosul in the north, close to where the Sumerian Tablets were unearthed, thecontents of the museum disappeared. The 2,000-year-old statue of King SaqnatroqII, one of Mesopotamia’s forgotten monarchs, was taken, along with irreplaceableAssyrian antiquities. Assyria followed the Sumerian civilisation. Compoundingthe crime is that the Baghdad museum also lost the card catalogue and computerrecords, making it far more difficult to track the stolen pieces. Lost, too, arethe findings of generations of archaeological study because the details of allexcavations in Iraq by international teams of archaeologists had to be reportedto the museum. In the words of one writer: “It threatens to turn the clock backmore than 150 years to the period before scientific archaeology in Mesopotamia.”54I am sure that some artefacts were removed by museum staff before the invasion,but it was also clear that the looting that followed the bombing was allowed andencouraged to happen by US authorities who wanted to destroy the Iraqi’s spiritand sense of identity, as well as stealing the artefacts that are so importantto them for historical and ritual reasons. People who knew what they werelooking for coldly and deliberately planned much of the looting in the museumsand galleries. In the ruins of the Saddam Arts Center in Baghdad, Iraqi artistMoayad al-Haidari said the looting had been well organised. It was not justtheft; the aim was much bigger than that. “This is to undermine us, ourheritage, our identity, our pride.” 55Tareq Abdulrazak, a 63-year-old scientist, stood outside the charred andsmouldering shell of Iraq’s national library, where every book and manuscripthas been destroyed. “Here was Iraq’s culture, ancient and modern, all inwriting”, he said. “The Americans watched this happen. It is not enough todestroy our buildings, our people? Now our history too?” 56 It was one of thekey aims of the ‘war’ to rape the museums of their priceless contents. MoayadDamerji of the Iraqi National Museum rightly said that the raid on his buildingwas planned in advance. “This was a program, well organized. The Americansprotected the oilfields, but did nothing to protect our museum, but they areobliged to protect these sites”, he said.57Dr Dony George, head of the Museum of History in Baghdad, told the media howprofessional experts had carried out the looting. He showed journalists ahandful of diamond glasscutters found on the premises and believed to have beenused by “the professional antiquity thieves” to cut glass and access delicateexhibits. The thieves had equipment to lift the heaviest objects and keys to thevaults where the most valuable items were stored. Dr George said: “I believethey were people who knew what they wanted. They had passed by the gypsum copyof the Black Obelisk. This means that they must have been specialists. They didnot touch those copies.” 58 He told Britain’s Channel 4 News that among theartefacts that have been stolen were the sacred vase of Warka, a 5,000-year-oldgolden vessel found at Ur, an Akkadian statue base and an Assyrian statue. Thishas been described as like stealing the Mona Lisa. The online version ofBusiness Week magazine said:> “It was almost as if the perpetrators were waiting for Baghdad to fall to make> their move. Gil J. Stein, a professor of archaeology at the University of> Chicago, which has been conducting digs in Iraq for 80 years, believes that> dealers ordered the most important pieces well in advance. ‘They were looking> for very specific artefacts,’ he says. ‘They knew where to look.’” 59 Experts confirmed that the looters also knew what they were looking for at themuseum in Mosul and in less than 10 minutes they had taken several milliondollars worth of Parthian sculpture. Where were the American troops? Shortlybefore the invasion, the American Council for Cultural Policy (ACCP), acoalition of American antiquities collectors and arts lawyers, met withofficials from the US Defense and State Departments to offer their assistance inpreserving Iraq’s archaeological collections.60 This is another pig troughoperation. Within this group are dealers who wanted to see an end to the strictIraqi laws on the ownership and export of antiquities. The group’s treasurer,William Pearlstein, described the laws as ‘retentionist’, (i.e. greedy dealerscouldn’t get their hands on them) and he has said he supported a post-wargovernment that would make it easier to have antiquities dispersed to the US.61Those who care about protecting history rather than profiting from itsexploitation have had deep suspicions about this group, which was only createdin 2001 after the Bush administration came to illegal power. Professor LordRenfrew of Kaimsthorn, a Cambridge archaeologist and director of the McDonaldInstitute for Archaeological Research, said: “Iraqi antiquities legislationprotects Iraq. The last thing one needs is some group of dealer-connectedAmericans interfering. Any change to those laws would be absolutely monstrous.”62 The Archaeological Institute of America agreed, saying that any weakening ofIraq’s strict antiquities laws would be “disastrous”.63 The president, PattyGerstenblith, said: “The [American Council for Cultural Policy] agenda is toencourage the collecting of antiquities through weakening the laws ofarchaeologically-rich nations and eliminate national ownership of antiquities toallow for easier export.” 64News of the meeting with government officials led to fears that restrictions ofexporting Iraqi artefacts would be eased after the war, but what happened waseven far worse than that. The heritage that belongs to all humanity is nowflooding the underground markets in Illuminati hands and the ground is beingprepared to allow their legal importation into the United States. Professor JohnMerryman of Stanford Law School, a member of the American Council for CulturalPolicy, called for a “selective international enforcement of export controls” inUS courts that would make it quite lawful to import objects systematicallylooted from Baghdad if a US court chooses not to recognise Iraqi legislation.65He argues that the fact that an art object had been stolen did not, in itself,bar it from lawful importation into the United States. Among the reasons for theorchestrated looting was to destroy as much of Islamic history as possiblebecause they know they have to dismantle the power of Islam to bring about theirworld state. Washington investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, was right onwhen he wrote:> “Bush and his advisers, previously warned that Iraq’s ancient artifacts and> collection of historical documents and books were in danger of being looted or> destroyed, instead, sat back while the Baghdad and Mosul museums and Baghdad> Library were ransacked and destroyed. Cult leaders have historically attempted> to destroy history in order to invent their own. The Soviets tried to> obliterate Russia’s Orthodox traditions, turning a number of churches into> warehouses and animal barns. Cambodia’s Pol Pot tried to wipe out Buddhism’s> famed Angkor Wat shrine in an attempt to stamp out his country’s Buddhist> history. In March 2001, while they were negotiating with the Bush> administration on a natural gas pipeline, Afghanistan’s Taliban blew up two> massive 1600-year old Buddhas in Bamiyan. The Bush administration, itself run> by fanatic religious cultists, barely made a fuss about the loss of the> relics. It would not be the first time the cultists within the Bush> administration ignored the pillaging of history’s treasures. The ransacking of> Iraq’s historical treasures is explainable when one considers what the blood> cult Christians really think about Islam.” 66 However, they are not “Christians”, they are practicing Satanists (see my otherbooks) and blood cult sums them up.Calculated catrastropheThe American government was given highly detailed information about the museums,their location and contents, and the historic archaeological sites around thecountry. It was supplied by experts who were deeply concerned about theconsequences of the US and British invasion. This included the United Nationsagency, UNESCO, who provided maps specific to these locations. ProfessorElizabeth C. Stone, the head of the Department of Anthropology of the New YorkState University at Stony Brook, who carried out research and excavation in Iraqbetween 1987 and 1990, told Fox News that she had written to the Pentagon and USforces asking them to take all possible measures to safeguard the treasures. Sheespecially emphasised the Museum of History in Baghdad, the world’s onlytreasure of invaluable antiquities dating back to the first civilisations inancient Mesopotamia and Babylonia. Professor Stone said that she receivedassurance from US forces that the museum would be protected as a matter ofutmost importance. But when the museum was raped and ransacked by looters,American troops were nowhere to be seen, exactly as always planned. ProfessorStone rightly compared the looting of the Baghdad Museum with the burning of theGreat Library at Alexandria by the (Illuminati-controlled) Roman Empire or therape of Aztec and Inca cultures by the (Illuminati-controlled) conquistadorsfrom Spain. Iraq, said Stone, is a country “who’s past has been decapitated”.67Yet, as Dr Irving Finkel of the British Museum told Britain’s Channel 4 News,the looting was “entirely predictable and could easily have been stopped”.68British journalist Robert Fisk ran to get US marines in an attempt to save someof the centuries-old illuminated copies of the Koran, other Islamic calligraphy,documents from the Ottoman Empire and other irreplaceable texts when the lootingbegan at the National Library. But the Marines refused to respond. Fisk wrote inthe Independent newspaper:> “I gave the map location, the precise name in Arabic and English. I said the> smoke could be seen from three miles away and it would take only five minutes> to drive there. Half an hour later, there wasn’t an American at the scene and> the flames were shooting 200 feet into the air.” 69 Nothing was done because it wasn’t meant to be done. Fisk told how an “army ofthieves” stormed the headquarters of UNICEF, which has been working to improvethe lives of Iraqi children since the 1980s, “throwing brand new photocopiers ontop of each other and sending cascades of UN files on child diseases, pregnancydeath rates and nutrition across the floors”.70 As the occupying power, wroteFisk, America was responsible for protecting embassies and UN offices in theirarea of control, but he saw US troops driving past the German embassy as looterscarried desks and chairs out of the front gate: “It is a scandal, a kind ofdisease, a mass form of kleptomania that American troops are blithely ignoring.”Where are the troops? Try the oil ministry.American troops allowed the mobs to loot and destroy the Ministry of Planning,Ministry of Education, Ministry of Irrigation, Ministry of Trade, Ministry ofIndustry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Culture and Ministry ofInformation and they refused to stop the looting of Iraq’s priceless historicaltreasures. But hundreds of soldiers were deployed to defend two ministries andthey remained undamaged – the Ministry of Oil and the Ministry of the Interiorwith its vast library of intelligence information about the country. A wholecompany of Marines, along with at least a half-dozen amphibious assault vehicleswas assigned to guard the Ministry of Oil, while the ones responsible for trade,information, planning, health and education (all those the US wants to reform inits own image) were left to their fate. Frank Viviano put it very well in theSan Francisco Chronicle long before the Iraq invasion:> “The hidden stakes in the war against terrorism can be summed up in a single> word: oil. The map of terrorist sanctuaries and targets in the Middle East and> Central Asia is also, to an extraordinary degree, a map of the world’s> principal energy sources in the 21st century … It is inevitable that the war> against terrorism will be seen by many as a war on behalf of America’s> Chevron, Exxon and Arco; France’s TotalFinaElf; British Petroleum; Royal Dutch> Shell and other multinational giants, which have hundreds of billions of> dollars of investment in the region.” 71 Even more so now.American troops “encouraged” looting. No, really?BBC News Online reported on May 6th 2003 how General Tommy Franks was threatenedwith a Belgian war crimes trial alleging that US troops failed to preventlooting in Iraq and the website said it had uncovered information suggestingthat his soldiers even “egged on” some looters. Dr Khalid Majeed described howhe tried in vain to persuade American troops to protect the Nasiriya TechnicalInstitute of higher education from a mob of looters, but they refused everytime. Dr Majeed, a community health lecturer at the college, said the crowdcarried knives and Kalashnikovs and they were shouting, “We need everything fromthis college”. He said he went to an American checkpoint and asked for help, butthey said they could not come. Eventually, he said, a colleague roused someAmericans based near the local fire station. They arrived in five vehicles, butrefused to stop the looters. Instead, the soldiers fired several dozen rounds atthe college’s south wall, Dr Majeed said. “It was a green light to the looters.It told them, ‘We are not going to do anything to stop you.’” Within fiveminutes the Americans had gone and the looters had moved in. The college wassoon little more than a shell. About 100 air conditioning units and 100computers were stolen. Rooms were torched; the science laboratories wrecked; andthe main lecture hall looked “like a hurricane has passed through it”. Butwitnesses said that it was not only that the American troops refused to stop themob, the looting was openly encouraged. Rasool Abdul-Husayn, an unemployedschoolteacher, said he saw an American soldier signalling the crowd to move in,with a repeated wave of the arm. Another eyewitness, Kareem Khattar, who worksin a bread shop across the road from the college, saw the same.> “I saw with my own eyes the Americans signal the people to move in and the> looters started clapping. The Americans waved bye-bye and the looters were> clapping. They started looting quickly and when one man came out with an air> conditioner an American said to him ‘Good, very good’.” 72 In a statement to BBC News Online, CentCom, the United States Central Command inDoha, Qatar, refused to accept responsibility for the event. Nothing new therethen. More confirmation of the encouragement the military gave to looters camefrom Khaled Bayomi in an interview with Dagens Nyheter, Sweden’s largestnewspaper based in Stockholm.73 Khaled Bayomi has taught and researched aboutMiddle Eastern conflicts for ten years at the University of Lund and hadtravelled to Baghdad to be a ‘human shield’ in support of the Iraqis during theconflict. “I happened to be right there just as the American troops encouragedpeople to begin the plundering”, he told the paper. He said he went to see somefriends who live near a dilapidated area on the west bank of the Tigris on April8th and the fighting was so intense he couldn’t get back. In the afternoon itbecame quiet and four American tanks took up places on the edge of the slumarea. The soldiers shot two Sudanese guards, he said, who stood at their postsoutside a local administration building. Then they blasted apart the doors tothe building and from the tanks came “eager calls in Arabic” encouraging peopleto come close to them:> “The entire morning, everyone who had tried to cross the road had been shot.> But in the strange silence after all the shooting, people gradually became> curious. After 45 minutes, the first Baghdad citizens dared to come out. Arab> interpreters in the tanks told the people to go and take what they wanted in> the building. The word spread quickly and the building was ransacked. I was> standing only 300 yards from there when the guards were murdered. Afterwards> the tank crushed the entrance to the Justice Department, which was in a> neighboring building, and the plundering continued there. I stood in a large> crowd and watched this together with them. They did not partake in the> plundering but dared not to interfere. Many had tears of shame in their eyes.> The next morning the plundering spread to the Modern Museum, which lies a> quarter mile farther north. There were also two crowds there, one that> plundered and one which watched with disgust.” He was asked if he was saying that American troops instigated the looting:> “Absolutely. The lack of jubilant scenes meant that the American troops needed> pictures of Iraqis who in different ways demonstrated hatred for Saddam’s> regime.” But what about the people who pulled down a large statue of Saddam? he wasasked.> “Did they? It was an American tank that did that, right beside the hotel where> all the journalists stay. Until lunchtime on April 9, I did not see one> destroyed Saddam portrait. If people had wanted to pull down statues they> could have taken down some of the small ones without any help from American> tanks. If it had been a political upheaval, the people would have pulled down> statues first and then plundered.” 74 Baghdad did not fall – it was handed overIn the opening days of the Iraqi war the American and British forces faced someserious opposition in the southern towns and cities, as they made their waynorth from Kuwait. If they could face that kind of resistance in the south, itwas fairly assumed that they were in for one hell of a battle to take thecapital, Baghdad. But this didn’t happen. Some terrible military decisions weremade that sent Iraq troops into conflict with the ‘coalition’ in the open desertwhere their firepower had not an earthly chance of competing with the state ofthe art technology they faced. However, the most effective use of those troopswould have caused the British and Americans some serious problems. Was thissimply incompetence or was there a deal at the highest levels? Most bizarre wasthat as the Iraqi troops retreated, not a single bridge was destroyed to thwartor slow the British and American advance. Why to goodness not?? It is basicdefensive warfare that you take out bridges your enemy needs to advance once itis clear you can no longer defend them. This is especially true in Iraq, whichis dominated by the two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. Instead, the bridgeswere left for the British and American troops to cross. Why?Robert Fisk in the UK Independent quoted an Iraqi brigadier-general commandingBaghdad’s missile air defences as saying that entire Republican Guard regimentswere withdrawn from the desert west of Baghdad on the orders of Saddam’s son,Qusay. These soldiers that were vital to the city’s defence took off theiruniforms and went home.75 “Our troops were fighting in the south much betterthan around Baghdad”, the general said. “They had help from the people in thevillages. The Americans and the British thought these people would support them,not fight against them.” 76 He said the defence of Baghdad was planned with twobelts of army defenders, one set 100km from the city, the other at 50km. “Oursouthern troops were in real fighting in the south in the first days of the warbut on around 30th or 31st March, the Republican Guard were ordered out of thedeserts and back into Baghdad. We don’t know why. Most had specific orders tostay at home.” 77 When the army in the south heard this news, he said, theirresistance that had prevented the capture of a single city started to collapse.On April 6th the army was ordered to abandon the south of Iraq and redeploy forthe defence of Baghdad.The Tehran Times also highlighted these anomalies.78 It pointed to the pause inUS and British operations amid criticism that the invasion was not turning outto be as easy as it had been sold. Following this pause, the paper said,suspicions rose when US troops, which had been stopped at the Euphrates, wereimmediately able to advance toward into the heart of Baghdad without any furthersignificant resistance by Iraqi forces. “Nobody asked why Tikrit, that was oncecalled the ideological heart of Saddam’s government and the last possible trenchof the Iraqi army, was never targeted by US and British bombs and missiles”, theTimes pointed out. “Or why, when the elite Iraqi forces arrived in eastern Iraqfrom Tikrit, the pace of the invaders advancing toward central Baghdadimmediately increased.” 79 It was also reported in early April that a plane hadbeen authorized to leave Iraq bound for Russia, the paper said. “Who was aboardthis plane?” The Times continued:> “All these ambiguities, the contradictory reports about Saddam’s situation,> and the fact that the highest-ranking Iraqi officials were all represented by> a single individual – Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed [‘Comical Ali’]> al-Sahhaf – and the easy fall of Baghdad shows that the center of collusion> had been Tikrit, where Saddam, his aides, and lieutenants from the Ba’ath> Party had been waiting for al-Sahhaf to join them so that they could receive> the required guarantees to leave the country in a secret compromise with> coalition forces. > “This possibility was confirmed by the Al-Jazeera network, which quoted a> Russian intelligence official as saying that the Iraqi forces and the invaders> had made a deal. The Russian official told Al-Jazeera that the Iraqi leaders> had agreed to show no serious resistance against the US-British troops in> return for a guarantee that Saddam and his close relatives could leave Iraq> unharmed.” 80 The paper pointed to the common theme of Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama binLaden in Afghanistan. “Is there any sign that the US is interested in findingthem and wiping them out?” 81 One should know that these two, as US henchmenover the past decade, provided enough pretexts for the White House to dominateAfghanistan, even though they are still at large, the report went on. Washingtonbenefited from its inability to find the Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. The sameheld true with Saddam. A minor dictator like Saddam was like a puppet that hasdanced for a lifetime to the tune of a certain major dictator like the US andcould not act on his own, the paper said. Saddam did whatever the White Housewanted him to do for years, said the Times. “Therefore, the simple answer to thequestion ‘Where is Saddam?’ is nothing but ‘Wherever the US desires!’” 82 I amfar from convinced that the ‘Saddam’ they eventually ‘caught’ is the real deal.With so many Saddam lookalikes on the payroll, as face recognition experts haveidentified, how would we know? I have heard it said by ‘coalition’ spokesmenthat the Iraqis collapsed so quickly because they were poorly trained andoperating with outdated and unmaintained equipment. But how does that square,then, with Iraq being a threat to the world, including the United States on theother side of the globe? It doesn’t because that was a lie. They lie to coverone question and lie again, using the opposite stance, to cover another.Doubles crossed?The obsession with selling a fable to the public means that we have to becautious about everything we are told – everything, no matter how apparentlyconvincing it may at first appear to be. This includes the deaths of Saddam’ssons, Uday and Qusay, or the ‘capture’ of ‘Saddam’ himself. Like I say, theyhave many doubles, as widely reported now, and Saddam and his brood have been“killed” a number of times before it was confirmed that they had not. The sonswere supposed to have been killed, together with Saddam’s 14-year-old grandsonand a “bodyguard”, in a shoot out with American troops at a house in Mosul. Theofficial story goes that these four guys, one a 14-year-old, held out in afire-fight against 200 heavily armed members of the American 101st AirborneDivision – supported by attack helicopters – for up to six hours until they werestrafed with bullets. Yeah, that makes sense. This residence was a palatialvilla belonging to the local tribal leader. Two months earlier American tankswere parked outside because the residence was requisitioned by the military.83As one Internet report said: “It’s like if Washington has been occupied by theRussians and Bush was hiding in the Oval Office.” 84 The military announced atfirst that the sons were extensively burned, possibly beyond recognition, butthen came the confident confirmations that they had ‘proved’ their identity.Photographs of them were then released after the bodies had undergone “facialreconstruction” before they were shown to journalists. “The two bodies haveundergone facial reconstruction with mortician’s putty to make them resemble asclosely as possible the faces of the brothers when they were alive”, a militaryofficial said.85 What if the authorities say they have confirmed a DNA match insuch circumstances? With their track record, how can you believe them?‘Freedom’ to agreeThe Illuminati manipulation of reality is not only founded on lies. They mustalso suppress the exposure of the lies by attacking the freedom of expression.Nothing highlights the Alice in Wonderland illusion in which we live more, thanthe insane belief that we live in freedom. I am always suspicious when agovernment has to continually tell the people how free they are. If the societywas truly free it would be patently obvious, no words necessary. Instead themantra of the ‘free world’ and the ‘Land of the Free’ are parroted constantlyand there is a good reason for this. The United States is actually a brutaldictatorship. While the slaughter of the innocent was claimed to be the‘liberation’ of Iraq and the replacement of tyranny with ‘freedom’, back home,in the Land of the Fee and Home of the Slave, freedom of expression wasvirtually dead. In truth, it has long been so, but it simply became moreblatant. If you spoke out against the carnage and the dismembering of childrenand their parents you were attacked from all angles. Natalie Maines, a singer inthe country music group, the Dixie Chicks, only said that she was embarrassedthat the president came from Texas and all hell ensued. They were vilified. Amob was organised to smash their CDs and much of the impetus for the boycott oftheir records came from radio stations owned by Clear Channel Communications ofTexas, which has close ties with the Bush family.86 Clear Channel stations alsourged people to arrange pro-war rallies. Roxanne Cordonier, who used the name,Roxanne Walker, as a presenter on the Clear Channel station, WMYI-FM/MY 102.5,alleged in a law suit that she was belittled, reprimanded and ultimately firedfor disagreeing on air with the invasion of Iraq. The suit cites a state lawthat declares a person cannot be fired for political opinions. Cordonier allegesthat some of the Clear Channel officers and directors have financial ties with,and are loyal to, President Bush and his policies. The suit alleges that she wasforced to participate in a pro-war rally. Cordonier, the South CarolinaBroadcasters Association Radio Personality of the Year for 2002, said shebelieves it’s an employer’s right to broadcast what it wants, but that itshouldn’t stifle opposing views. “Either don’t talk about it at all or make itfair”, she said.87 The Dixie Chicks said during a tearful ABC-TV interview thatthey feared for their lives after getting death threats and Maines hasapologised for her opinion about Bush in an effort to limit the damage. Rememberthis is the country that claims to be ‘liberating’ others from tyranny. TheHollywood Reporter told how Ed Gernon, the executive producer of a mini-seriesabout Adolf Hitler, called Hitler: The Rise of Evil, had been fired because hecompared the mood of Americans to that of the Germans who helped Hitler rise topower.88 He had worked for his production company, Alliance Atlantis, for elevenyears, but the paper reported that the association ended when Gernon said in aninterview that the rise of Hitler “basically boils down to an entire nationgripped by fear, who ultimately chose to give up their civil rights and plungedthe whole nation into war”. Gernon added: “I can’t think of a better time toexamine this history than now.” 89 The man was right, of course, but what doesthat matter to the mind-fascists? This is what the Nazi Propaganda Minister, DrJoseph Goebbels, said about suppressing dissent:> “The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the> people from the political, economic, and/or military consequences of the lie.> It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to> repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by> extension, the truth becomes the greatest enemy of the State.” This is what we see today. Actor Tim Robbins and his actress partner, SusanSarandon, were at the forefront of the anti-war protests in Hollywood, alongwith people like Martin Sheen and Sean Penn. Robbins talked about a “climate offear” for lesser-known actors:> “I know we’re lucky. We have money in the bank. We have careers that support> us continuing to work. [But] if I was a mid-range or supporting actor, in this> kind of environment, it would be a lot scarier for me to risk the progression> of my career [by criticising the war]. I know people like that, and they’ve> said thank you to me for saying the things that they can’t.” 90 Actually they can. It’s just that they choose not to because they fear theeffect on their careers. What is more important? It was not only, or indeedprimarily, the rich and famous that faced a backlash for their “unacceptable”views. Armed police targeted public protests against the war and otherdemonstrators were arrested for protesting “without a permit”. Can anyone giveme an example of anyone arrested for backing the war without a permit? The UKGuardian reported how a right-wing ‘talk show host’ on WABC called Curtis Sliwacould hardly speak for laughing when he took a call from a listener describingwhat he saw while carrying an American flag and yelling support for thetroops.91 The caller said he had seen a woman carrying a sign saying, “No bloodfor oil”. “She was wearing black and she was an older lady”, the caller said,“and then our sheriff saw her and she didn’t have a permit. So they put her inthe back of the truck car and hauled her away.” Oh what a hoot. Ain’t it greatto live in the land of freedom? The harassment of those with a different view tothat of the Village Idiot are subjected to harassment and arrest, some peopleeven ordered to leave shopping malls because they were wearing anti-warT-shirts. But it was fine to walk around with badges saying, “Give War a Chance”and “First Iraq, then France”, or pathetically rename French fries “freedomfries” because of the French opposition to the mass murder by American andBritish forces.In Oakland, California, police opened fire with rubber bullets on peopledemonstrating against the war and some 40 were injured, one seriously. DavidSolnit of Direct Action to Stop the War, a network of direct action groups, saidthe police gave an order to disperse, which was unusual, and then they didn’tgive people enough time to leave. “They fired rubber bullets, wooden bullets andbeanbags right into the crowd”, he said. What kind of world is it when thoseopposing the murder of children are abused as “disgusting” and “selfish”, asthey are in the United States? The Minnesota governor even proposed thatarrested activists should cover their own law-enforcement costs and others wereconcerned, wait for this, that disruptive demonstrations might hamper emergencyvehicles from reaching hospitals and compromise security by distracting policeforces from terrorist threats!!92 OK guys, now don’t forget, you have to breatheevery few seconds, come on, in, out, in, out. Write it down, it’ll help youremember. A national survey of television viewers by the media-consulting firmFrank N. Magid Associates said that only 16 per cent of the 2,034 people polledonline felt strongly or somewhat strongly that anti-war coverage should be apriority in local newscasts.93 But then, to be fair, would you believe what apublic survey told you? While the most minor pro-war events and statements werewidely reported, even massive anti-war protests were all, but ignored by theAmerican propaganda networks.This is how the Illuminati agencies in politics, military and media spin humanreality. They tell us what they want us to believe and suppress the people andfacts that challenge the deceit. If we wish to end this Nazi control ofinformation we must refuse to be silenced and give all the support we can tothose who are prepared to speak out. Another simple rule to remember is thatwhen a political or military spokesman is telling you what to believe, you canbe sure of one thing: they are lying to you.

The US and Britishoccupation force talked of “giving the country back to Iraqis” when that, intrue Orwellian style, was the last thing they had in mind. War plans alsoinclude agreeing which of the Illuminati corporations will have the contracts to‘rebuild’ the target country after the same corporations have provided theweaponry and expertise to destroy it. The technique takes the same basic formevery time.The man appointed to control Iraq immediately after the war was LieutenantGeneral Jay Garner, a close friend of Cheney and Rumsfeld. He is a staunch andvocal supporter of the Israeli government and of JINSA, the Jewish Institute forNational Security Affairs. Garner accepted an all-expenses-paid trip to Israelto say how much he admired the “restraint” of the Israeli army in thePalestinian occupied territories. He’s ideal to run an Arab country, then.Garner was brought out of retirement in January 2003 to become director of the‘Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance for Iraq’. This was inpreparation for his role in Iraq after the war that we were told was “still notinevitable”. Garner is president of SY Coleman, the defence firm thatspecialises in Patriot missiles. It was awarded a contract worth in excess of abillion dollars for logistics support to US Special Forces. It is a subsidiaryof L-3 Communications, a major funder of US political parties. Bush laterappointed the former State Department official, Paul Bremer, a close associateof Rumsfeld, to head the American civil service in Iraq with authority even overGarner.1 His job was to oversee the transition to ‘democracy’, the Bush mobsterssaid. Bremer served in the Reagan- Bush years as ‘ambassador-at-large’ forcounter terrorism before joining the notorious ‘consulting firm’, KissingerAssociates, (see my other books ad infinitum). Bremer is yet another insider, ofcourse he is, that’s why he got the job. As I was completing this book, theWashington Post reported that James Baker had been asked to take overall controlof Iraqi ‘reconstruction’.2 This is the same James Baker that was Secretary ofState to father George Bush during the 1991 Gulf conflict; the one who washeavily involved in getting the unelected boy Bush into the White House; and themajor player with father George in the Illuminati subsidiary called the CarlyleGroup with its connections into the Bin Laden family. President Bush also namedReuben Jeffrey III as Washington-based coordinator for Iraq reconstruction. Heis a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs who had been “coordinating thefederal aid aimed to help reconstruct lower Manhattan”.3The Pentagon lawyer, Michael Mobbs, was appointed to control eleven governmentministries in Iraq. This is the man who wants Americans jailed indefinitelywithout charge for ‘terrorist offences’ and he was the defender of freedom whocreated the “legal framework” for the unlimited detention of prisoners withoutcharge or trial at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mobbs is a close friendof Richard Perle and worked for the law firm of under secretary at the DefenseDepartment, the neo-con Douglas Feith. Another major player in post-Saddam Iraqis George Shultz, the Secretary of State to Reagan- Bush, and advisor to boyGeorge’s presidential campaign. He is on the board of Bechtel, a highlysignificant Illuminati company that built the facilities at Guantanamo Bay andhas won major contracts for the ‘reconstruction’ of Iraq. Shultz is chairman ofthe International Council of the Illuminati banking operation, J.P. Morgan Chase(see And The Truth Shall Set You Free), in which Lewis Libby, Cheney’s Chief ofStaff and Project for the New American Century member, has large investments.Morgan Chase lent Saddam’s regime $500 million in 1983 – the year Rumsfeld metthe Iraqi leader to discuss the supply of chemical and biological weapons.During that visit Rumsfeld apparently spent much of his stay negotiating withSaddam’s Ba’ath Party for Shultz’s Bechtel to build an oil pipeline. Shultz wasa member of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq and patron of the AmericanEnterprise Institute, home to Iraqi war architects like Richard Pearle and 14members of the Bush cabinet. William Eagleton is another long-time Bush familyinsider who was wheeled out to ‘rebuild Iraq’. He went to Yale University, thehome of the Skull and Bones Society, with father George Bush. Eagleton was theChief of US Interests in Iraq between 1980 and 1984 – once again the time whenRumsfeld arrived to meet with Saddam over the supply of chemical and biologicalweapons. Robert Reilly, the former director of the government-controlled radiostation, Voice of America, was appointed to create “Radio Free Iraq” andbasically take control of the ‘Iraqi’ media. Reilly is part of the groupplanning a satellite TV station on behalf of the US government to broadcastpropaganda across the Middle East. He is a close friend and business associateof Ahmed Chalabi, a US choice to run the Iraqi government on their behalf. TheJewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) also supports Chalabi,which is great because clearly they have the best interests of the Iraqi peopleat heart and have no hidden agenda, despite their connections to so many peoplebehind the war.4Ahmed “watch your pockets” ChalabiAhmed Chalabi is supported by Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz, aleading light in JINSA, and he’s been described as “Cheney’s protégé”. This ishardly surprising given that Chalabi is connected to the Illuminati AmericanEnterprise Institute. Chalabi comes from an aristocratic Shiite family in Iraqthat was connected to King Faisal II and the Hashemite monarchy installed by theBritish when they drew lines in the sand to create Iraq after the First WorldWar. The Hashemites rule Jordan and claim descent from Hashem, a forebear of theprophet Muhammad. The Clean Break document produced in 1996 for former Israelileader, Benjamin Netanyahu, called for Saddam Hussein to be removed and replacedwith Hashemite royalty, the ruling bloodline of Jordan. One of Chalabi’srelatives, Fadhil Chalabi, was involved in the oil industry for more than 30years and was Deputy Secretary of the Organisation of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) and Under Secretary of Oil at the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum.Chalabi’s family fled to Hashemite-ruled Jordan when the British-imposed Iraqi‘monarchy’ was overthrown in 1958 and he became an extremely wealthy bankerthere before he was found guilty in his absence by a military court in 1989 of amassive fraud. He was sentenced to 22 years, but it appears that he fled in theboot (trunk) of a car with $20 million. The fraud led to the collapse of theJordanian bank he directed, Petra Bank, and the government had to pay out $200million to depositors who faced the loss of their savings.The INC (CIA)Chalabi founded the Iraqi National Congress (INC) in 1992 at a meeting of exilesheld in Vienna, Austria, and James Woolsey, the Director of the CIA and memberof the Project for the New American Century, became Chalabi’s champion. Hesettled in London as leader of the INC that was funded by the CIA to the tune of$325,000 a month and he apparently received some $12 million from the US afterthe 1991 Gulf conflict. It was from Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress thatmuch bogus “intelligence” originated; this was used by Bush and Blair to “prove”the Saddam threat. Chalabi often visited Israel when he was with the Petra Bankand became friendly with the late Albert Wohlstetter, whom he first met while astudent at the University of Chicago – also attended by Zalmay Khalilzad, theBush ‘special envoy’ to Afghanistan and Iraq. Wohlstetter was an inspiration forthe so-called neo-conservative movement in the United States and, through him,Chalabi met … Richard Perle. Yes, the Pentagon advisor at the forefront ofpromoting war in Iraq. At the time Perle was Under-Secretary of Defense forinternational-security policy to Reagan-Bush. Today, Perle backs Chalabi to leadIraq even though he hasn’t lived there since 1958. According to a Glasgow SundayHerald report, Perle’s JINSA associate, Deputy Defense Secretary, PaulWolfowitz, wants other members of the Iraqi National [CIA] Congress involved inthe US puppet government. These include Chalabi’s nephew Salem Chalabi, ArasHabib and Dr Ali Yassin Karim, Habib’s cousin, a former medic with the CIA, whowas retained by the agency despite threats of dismissal after the interventionof former CIA Director, James Woolsey, the member of JINSA and the Project forthe New American Century. Chalabi’s friends, Tamara Daghestani and GoranTalebani, are two others on the Wolfowitz list of US front men in the newgovernment of ‘free’ Iraq.5 Chalabi was named by the Americans on a 25- strong‘council’ to ‘advise’ the US occupiers. The Iraqis have not turned out to be asstupid as the neo-cons would like to believe, however, and the campaign to stopChalabi and the INC taking control has been mobilised to scupper the plan.Returning “home”?On Tuesday, April 15th 2003, Jay Garner and Zalmay Khalilzad hosted a meeting ofIraqi groups in the shadow of the 4,000-year-old ziggurat at Ur. Ziggurats arethe step-pyramid temples of the ancient Sumerians. Those who have read my bookslike The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix will understand the deepsignificance of this for the symbolism-obsessed Illuminati who trace theirbloodlines back to Babylon and Sumer in what is now Iraq. I will add to thissignificance in the next chapter. Ur is also the alleged home of Abraham, theman claimed to have founded Judaism and to be an ancestor to both Jews andArabs. What he is not, of course, is an ancestor of the Ashkenazi/Khazars.Garner, who had just turned 65, said: “What better birthday can a man have thanto begin it not only where civilization began but where a free Iraq and ademocratic Iraq will begin today?”6 I am not sure I would put it that waymyself. Zalmay Khalilzad assured the delegates that the United States had “nointerest, absolutely no interest, in ruling Iraq”. He added: “We want you toestablish your own democratic system based on Iraqi traditions and values.”7 Ifhe had been like that other puppet, Pinocchio, his nose would have immediatelystretched from Baghdad to Washington. Mind you, it’s probably that length, andmore, most of the time. This meeting was supposed to be the start of the processof establishing a new Iraqi-controlled ‘democratic’ government, but that issimply not going to happen. The American-British (Illuminati) agenda is tocontrol the Middle East, not give it back to the people. A front regime will becreated dominated by US place men and they will continue to control the oil andthe country and establish permanent military bases from which they will launchtheir further expansion and control of the region in consort with Israel. AnyIraqi opposition to this US dictatorship, and it has already begun, will bedismissed as agitation manipulated by Iran or “Saddam sympathisers” to underminethe new “free” Iraq, thus offering the excuse to stay in the country and targetIran. The CIA and British intelligence have a long record of manipulating theinternal affairs of Iran and there is no way that the student protests againstthe Iranian government have not been “encouraged” by those sources to supporttheir plans for occupation. As for Syria, I think you are going to be havingsome American tourists at some point and they won’t be bearing gifts. Guidedmissiles, maybe, but not gifts!Snorting in the pig troughThe Illuminati strategy in their manipulated wars is to use their armamentcompanies to supply the weapons to destroy a country (paid for by the taxpayersand loans from Illuminati banks) and then use their construction and othercompanies to rebuild it (paid for by the taxpayer and loans from Illuminatibanks). This tax money from the people is funnelled through many sources,including ‘aid’ from national governments, the United Nations, InternationalMonetary Fund, World Bank and charities funded by support from the sametaxpayers. The Illuminati work to control government aid agencies; they control– indeed create – many ‘charities’; and, as I have detailed in previous books,they set up the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The latter iscurrently headed by James Wolfensohn, a close business associate of the deeplyIlluminati House of Rothschild banking empire that uses Jewish people as pawnsin its horrific game. What a surprise that within days of American troopsentering Baghdad we had Bush calling for the ending of sanctions (imposedthrough the United Nations by the United States and United Kingdom) that hadcost the lives of around a million Iraqi children since 1991. We’re here now, wedon’t want sanctions once we’re in control, and we’ve got money to make. The USgovernment also called on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)to support the reconstruction of Iraq and for countries to write off Iraqidebts. They use taxpayer’s money from every source possible to fill the pocketsof their corporations. US Treasury Secretary John Snow said the internationalinstitutions would have a “vital role to play in the reconstruction of Iraq”8(“Give us your money”) and IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler told the BBC thatit was time for the world’s political leaders “to stop squabbling” and agree apolitical framework for Iraq in order to get on with the task of helping itspeople to rebuild (“agree to what the US wants”).9 Koehler said the IMF hadexperience in post-conflict situations, and could help stabilise Iraq’scurrency, manage its external debt, and help manage its tax system (“give uscontrol of their financial system”).Knock ’em down …The ‘defence’ companies that made multi-multi billions supplying the weapons todevastate Iraq and its people were all Illuminati controlled. The Defense PolicyBoard at the Pentagon is the major route to winning such contracts. It washeaded by Richard Perle, the JINSA member of the far-right American EnterpriseInstitute and Project for the New American Century, until he was forced toresign over conflicts of interest. He remains on the board. Another eight of hisfellow board members have connections to companies that won contracts from thePentagon, among them Northrop Grumman, Bechtel and the Rand Corporation (formeremployees, Lewis Libby and Zalmay Khalilzad). Defense Policy Board membersinclude General Jack Sheehan (connected to Bechtel), former CIA chief, JamesWoolsey and former Republican Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger. NorthropGrumman won contracts worth $8.5 billion in 2002. This is connected to JINSA andthe American Enterprise Institute with its 14 members of the Bush cabinet.Another beneficiary of war and the fantastic increases in military spending byBush, is SY Coleman, headed by … yes, yes … Jay Garner, the man appointed byBush to ‘lead’ Iraq after the war. James Woolsey comes up often, as you willhave noted, and he has been a director of DynCorp, a ‘security’ organisationthat operates wherever the United States chooses to ‘liberate’.10 DynCorp, whichwon a multi-million dollar contract to run the Iraqi police force, is a majordonor to Bush’s Republican Party and its personnel in Bosnia bought and soldgirls as young as twelve and videotaped the rape of a woman. They ran a brotheland competed to see who could own the youngest girl.11 The company was forced topay more than $150,000 in compensation to Kathryn Bolkovac, a former UNInternational Police Force monitor under contract to DynCorp, who was fired forblowing the whistle on their sex ring. Another DynCorp employee, Ben Johnston,who also exposed the scandal, was dismissed and taken into protective custody bythe United States Army Criminal Investigation Unit until they could get himsafely out of the country. Johnston filed a lawsuit, which said:> “In the latter part of 1999 Johnston learned that employees and supervisors> from DynCorp were engaging in perverse, illegal and inhumane behavior [and]> were purchasing illegal weapons, women, forged passports and [participating> in] other immoral acts. Johnston witnessed co-workers and supervisors> literally buying and selling women for their own personal enjoyment and> employees would brag about the various ages and talents of the individual> slaves they had purchased.” 12 Johnson also reported that drinking on the job [while repairing militaryaircraft!], fraud and complete incompetence were “de rigueur” (the rule, not theexception) at DynCorp. This is the operation that has been contracted to operatethe Iraqi police force. DynCorp was among a few companies “quietly invited” tobid for the contract. A State Department official called the process “a limitedcompetition” that was born of urgency. David Isenberg, a senior analyst in theWashington office of the British American Security Information Council, said:“Since you already have a population in Iraq that is highly suspicious of us andour motives, do you really want someone with DynCorp’s baggage doing this sortof work there?” 13 Actually, it’s just the kind of company a Bush administrationwould want, I would have thought. Since 1996, DynCorp’s contract for the Balkanshas been expanded to include police-training and advisory missions in East Timorand Afghanistan and this has earned some $300 million.14 A group of Ecuadoreanpeasants filed a class action against the company alleging that herbicidesspread by DynCorp in Colombia were drifting across the border, killing crops,causing illness and killing children.When we are talking about ‘defence’ contractors and Illuminati companies thatmake billions from government contracts, we must never forget the Carlyle Group,much loved by the Bin Laden family, and headed by former CIA number two, FrankCarlucci, and people like father George Bush and his Secretary of State at thetime of the Gulf War, James Baker, who has been asked by boy Bush to head‘reconstruction’ in Iraq. Carlyle chairman Carlucci is on the Board of Trusteesof the Illuminati Rand Corporation and co-chair of the Rand Center for MiddleEast Public Policy Advisory Board. Carlucci and James Baker are close friendsand associates of the current US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Baker was aclassmate of Rumsfeld at Yale University and Carlucci was Rumsfeld’s roommate atYale.15 Secretary of State Colin Powell has also described Carlucci as his“mentor”. Carlucci admits that in February 2001 he met with Rumsfeld and VicePresident Dick Cheney to talk about military policy. This was at a time whenCarlyle had several defence projects worth billions of dollars underconsideration. How hilarious, therefore, are the comments of Carlucci when hesaid: “I’ve made it clear that I don’t lobby the defense industry. I will giveour Carlyle bankers advice on what they might do and whom they should talk to.But I do not pick up the phone and say you should fund X, Y or Z.” 16 Then thereare the claims of David Rubenstein, one of Carlyle’s founders and a former aideto the Jimmy Carter administration, that was served at the CIA by Carlucci.Rubenstein said: “Mr [father George] Bush gives us no advice on what to do withthe federal government. We’ve gone over backwards to make sure that we do nolobbying.” 17 So funny. But even funnier was this claim by Daniel A. D’Aniello,a Carlyle managing director: “We are greatly assisted by Baker and Bush …[because] … it shows that we are associated with people of the highest ethicalstandards.” That’s about as wrong as any sentence has ever been in all humanhistory. Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Washington-based Centerfor Public Integrity, hit the button when he said:> “Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as they can> possibly be. [Father] Bush is getting money from private interests that have> business before the government, while his son is president. And, in a really> peculiar way, George W. Bush could, some day [some day??] benefit financially> from his own administration’s decisions, through his father’s investments. The> average American doesn’t know that and, to me, that’s a jaw-dropper.” 18 … and build ’em upAs always, having fleeced the people to fund their war on Iraq, the Illuminatifleeced the people still further for ‘Iraqi reconstruction’. USAID is thegovernment agency handing out the contracts to rebuild the country after the USbombing destroyed it and the Iraqi people had no say in this at all. OnlyAmerican companies connected to Bush and his masters need have any thoughts ofwinning a contract. There was no bidding process even among US companies; a fewwere “invited to apply”. International Resources Group of Washington DC, whichwon a $70 million contract for ‘humanitarian aid’, has four vice-presidents whoheld top posts with USAID and half the company’s technical staff worked for theagency. USAID is headed by Andrew Natsios, who was chief executive officer ofthe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority during the infamous and record-breakingcost overrun for a three-mile road tunnel in Boston known as the ‘Big Dig’. Theproject was cost out at $3.5 billion in 1985, but went on to devour $23 billion.The beneficiary of this was George Shultz’s Bechtel. And hey, who got afantastic contract to reconstruct Iraq? Well, well – Bechtel. The contract isworth the best part of a billion dollars and, with an estimated $100 billion tobe spent, this will be just the start. George Shultz, the former Reagan-BushSecretary of State; Casper Weinberger, the former Reagan-Bush Defense Secretarywho was charged over Iran- Contra drugs or arms scandal and pardoned by fatherBush; and General Jack Sheehan of the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board, will bedelighted. All are with Bechtel, a major funder of Bush’s Republican Party.Shultz was boy George’s presidential campaign advisor. Riley Bechtel, thechairman and chief executive officer of the Bechtel Group, is even a member ofthe Bush Administration with his position on the Export Council. Bechtel’scontract is for infrastructure repair work on power generation facilities,electrical grids, municipal water systems, sewage systems, airport facilities,the dredging, repair and upgrading of the Umm Qasr seaport, and includes apossible role in repair and reconstruction of hospitals, schools, selectedgovernment ministry buildings, irrigation facilities and transportation links,all of which were destroyed by the bombs of the Illuminati armament companies.Bechtel has a long history of work in Iraq, not least under the rule ofRumsfeld’s old friend, Saddam Hussein. Tom Hash, the President of BechtelNational, said: “Bechtel is honored to have been selected, through a competitiveprocess, by USAID to help bring humanitarian assistance, economic recovery andinfrastructure to help the Iraqi people.” 19 I love it.The Bin BechtelsBechtel, like the Bush family, has very close connections with the Bin Ladens,as revealed by the New Yorker magazine.20 It said that Osama bin Laden’sextraordinarily wealthy construction empire in Saudi Arabia is a substantialinvestor with a $10 million stake in a private equity firm called the FremontGroup, founded by Bechtel. Both are based in San Francisco. It was a Bechtelsubsidiary until 1986 and, as the Fremont website says, it still “enjoys a closerelationship with Bechtel”. It is, in fact, rather more than that. A Fremontspokesman confirmed to the New Yorker that the majority ownership is in thehands of the Bechtel family. Five of Fremont’s eight directors are alsodirectors of Bechtel and one of them, Riley Bechtel, is the chairman and chiefexecutive officer of the Bechtel Group. George Shultz is a director both ofFremont and the Bechtel Group, where he was once president. Rick Kopf, thegeneral counsel of the Fremont Group, which manages some eleven billion dollarsin assets, confirms that the Bin Laden family invested about ten million dollarsin one of Fremont’s private funds before September 11th. He said the Bin Ladenfamily has not enlarged its stake since then, but declined to discuss furtherthe association of the company to the Bin Ladens. He also chose not to discussthe origin or the nature of the relationship between the Bin Laden and Bechtelfamilies, both of which have made fortunes in huge construction projects in Arabcountries. Kopf said: “Ownership is private and is not disclosed.” 21 What astink would ensue if the ownership of these organisations were revealed.Companies awarded massive contracts paid for by public money should not underany circumstances be allowed to keep their ownership secret. The secrecy notonly makes corruption possible, it ensures it.Root of corruptionHalliburton is the biggest oil services company in the world, thanks to aconsiderable extent to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was CEO from 1995 to 2000when he left to join the Bush campaign. He was given a $34 million ‘retirement’package when he left to nurse maid George W. Bush and remains on the payroll.Halliburton was engaged through its major subsidiary, Kellogg Brown and Root, toextinguish the oil well fires in Iraq (no doubt ignited by US Special Forces)and repair oil facilities at a reported cost of some seven billion dollars,although the contract does not specify a time or cost limit. The company wasawarded the contract by the Army Corps of Engineers under federal laws thatallow negotiations to be conducted in secret and without competition because ofnational security. But it later emerged that the contract involved rather morethan just putting out oil fires. It gave Cheney’s Halliburton the power tocontrol all phases of Iraq’s oil industry.22 Henry Waxman, a Democratrepresentative for California, said he had received a letter from the Army onMay 2nd 2003 confirming that the Halliburton contract can include ‘operation’ ofIraqi oil fields and ‘distribution’ of Iraqi oil. Officials had previously saidthe contract dealt only with putting out oil well fires and performing emergencyrepairs as needed. This was the oil, you recall, that was going to be controlledby the Iraqis in the pre-war propaganda from the White House and Downing Street.Waxman said in a letter to the Army on May 6th 2003: “These new disclosures aresignificant, and they seem at odds with the [Bush] administration’s repeatedassurances that the Iraqi oil belongs to the Iraqi people.” 23Kellogg Brown and Root is nothing to do with breakfast cereal and everything todo with drug running, arms dealing and gorging on government contracts. I havehighlighted the background to this company in Alice in Wonderland and the WorldTrade Center Disaster. It is a major subsidiary of Halliburton, which has aworldwide operation involving 130 countries and is America’s biggest non-unioncompany.24 While Cheney was Defense Secretary (and before and afterwards), Brownand Root has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of constructioncontracts in war zones like Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti after they had beendevastated by US bombing and manipulation. Halliburton has worked closely withsome of the most appalling terrorist dictatorships on the planet. Cheney talksof “constructive engagement” in which you work with such regimes and pass onAmerican values. No need. The values of successive American and Britishgovernments are a mirror of those employed by these very terroristdictatorships. For Cheney, this is nothing to do with “values” – he doesn’t haveany – it is about working with anyone at any price to ensure more money andpower, and the advancement of the Illuminati agenda. Halliburton had connectionsto Permindex, a British intelligence front organisation headed by the CanadianLouis M. Bloomfield, which, it is now well documented, was a centralcoordinating network behind the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in1963. (See also And the Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailed background.)Permindex organised death squads in Europe, Mexico, Central America, theCaribbean and the United States. This is the way the Illuminati families andagents operate. They control the government decisions through the Illuminatione-party state and operate companies, like Halliburton and the Carlyle Group,which benefit from those government decisions and policies. This is how, onceCheney took over, Halliburton was able to expand so rapidly and become the fifthlargest defence contractor in the United States, so benefiting enormously fromconflicts like the ‘war on terrorism’. Cheney was the Defense Secretary in theGulf conflict supposedly aimed at Saddam Hussein in 1991. Yet he made bigprofits for himself and Halliburton after 1998 through deals with … SaddamHussein’s Iraq. The London Financial Times reported that Cheney oversaw $23.8million worth of contracts for the sale of ‘oil industry’ technology andservices to Iraq. He used Halliburton subsidiaries in France, Italy, Germany andAustria to hide the Cheney-Halliburton connection. Among these companies wereDresser Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump.25 These contracts together were worthmore than any other US company doing business with Iraq. The InternationalHerald Tribune reported that “Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll- Dresser Pump Co. …have done work in Iraq on contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq’s oilindustry, under the United Nations’ Oil for Food Program”.26 A Halliburtonspokesman admitted in the Tribune article that the Dresser subsidiaries had soldoil-pumping equipment to Iraq via their European agents.So get this: these contracts for Cheney’s Halliburton group were helping torebuild the oil infrastructure of Iraq destroyed by the bombs dropped by UnitedStates planes commanded from the Pentagon by the then Defense Secretary DickCheney. Now they are at it again after the Bush-Cheney administration re-bombedIraq in 2003! While making money from Iraq for Halliburton, Cheney supportedsanctions against Iraq that produced around a million dead children (so whathappened to “constructive engagement”?). Since the second Iraqi conflict hiscompany is winning more contracts from the same US government, of which he isVice President. You could not make this up. Halliburton has also struck deals inIran and Libya, even though they were on the State Department’s list ofterrorist states. The Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root was fined$3.8 million for violation of US sanctions against Libya. In 2002, they alsoagreed to pay the US government $2 million to settle claims that while Cheneywas in charge it defrauded the military. This involved a lawsuit alleging thecompany made false claims and statements in 224 delivery orders between April1994 and September 1998. This pay-off to avoid the courts has happened on sixother occasions. Cheney has been the biggest shareholder in Halliburton with astake of some $45.5 million and the company’s board includes LawrenceEagleburger, who held State Department posts under President Father George andis an executive of the infamous Kissinger Associates (see And The Truth ShallSet You Free). Paul Bremer, who was appointed to head the American civil servicein Iraq, is a former executive with Kissinger Associates.Paying for the privilegeHalliburton and Brown and Root have long used political patronage and funding toexpand business and profits. Brown and Root’s ticket to the top came through itspolitical contributions to President Lyndon Johnson from the time he ran forSenate in 1948. The Austin Chronicle once called him “the candidate from Brownand Root”.27 Thanks to Johnson they made billions on government contracts,including those relating to the Vietnam War after Johnson reversed the policiesof the assassinated JFK and plunged America deeper into the conflict. DuringVietnam, Johnson gave his personal funders contracts for airports, pipelines andmilitary bases.28 According to biographer Ronnie Dugger, author of ThePolitician: The Life and Times of Lyndon Johnson,29 much of the money he waspaid by Brown and Root came in cash. “It was a totally corrupt relationship andit benefited both of them enormously”, says Dugger, “Brown and Root got rich,and Johnson got power and riches.” Using the same tactics, the contracts haveflowed from government ever since. Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angelespolice narcotics officer, wrote in a study of Brown and Root:> “From Bosnia and Kosovo, to Chechnya, to Rwanda, to Burma, to Pakistan, to> Laos, to Vietnam, to Indonesia, to Iran to Libya to Mexico to Colombia, Brown> & Root’s traditional operations have expanded from heavy construction to> include the provision of logistical support for the U.S. military. Now,> instead of U.S. Army quartermasters, the world is likely to see Brown & Root> warehouses storing and managing everything from uniforms to rations to> vehicles.” 30 In Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster, I expose theappalling background to Halliburton/Brown and Root. This includes the drug andarms running activities that have been highlighted from personal experience byMike Ruppert (see his website at http://www.fromthewilderness.com[http://www.fromthewilderness.com]). The Illuminati control the global drugrunning network and it was no surprise when the Pakistan Interior Minister,Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat, said the poppy cultivation for the production ofopium and heroin has risen to record levels in Afghanistan after the fall of theTaliban, but US-led coalition forces were doing nothing to address the problem.He said:> “Two-thirds of that is on our western borders. We have asked the Americans, we> told the commanders of allied forces — what hampers you, or what restricts you> from totally neutralising this cultivated land? They say that is not within> our mandate. Now, when we are told such things, it certainly is something> which is hard to digest.” 31 Not so hard to understand, though, when you realise that the force behind theinvasion of Afghanistan controls the global drugs market (see Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster and The Biggest Secret for thedrug connections to the Bush family and the present US administration).Increasing the Afghanistan opium supply from the world’s biggest source was allpart of the invasion plan.More snort, snortsA company that works closely with Halliburton is the Parsons Corporation. It hasdonated $152,000 to Bush’s Republican Party and has helped to ‘reconstruct’Kosovo and Bosnia after American and British bombers went to work. Elaine Chao,the US Labour Secretary, was on the Parsons board before joining the Bushgovernment. Parsons is in line for ‘reconstruction’ contracts in Iraq worth $900million. Lucent Technologies, Qualcomm and others have been named in relation tothe one billion dollars on offer to replace Iraq’s telecommunications and thatwill please the Pentagon under-secretary, Douglas J. Feith (member of JINSA whoselects the members of the Defense Policy Board) and Cheney’s Chief of Staff,Lewis Libby (Project for the New American Century). Feith has around half amillion dollars invested in Lucent and Libby is a shareholder at Qualcomm. Libbyalso has shares in another company, Raytheon Corp, which has apparently beenselected with Kellogg Brown and Root to destroy ‘weapons of mass destruction’.Not much money in that though, eh?32 One of the first USAID contracts went tothe union-breaking Stevedore Services of America to ‘manage’ the Umm Qasr Porton Iraq’s Gulf Coast, which was taken early in the conflict. Its president, JohnHemingway, makes contributions to the Republican Party and the contract angeredthe British government and army. (You don’t count guys, you’re just there tosend in the British troop fodder, so get used to it). Robin Cook, who resignedfrom the Blair government in protest at the war, commented:> “The dispute over the management of the port of Umm Qasr is a good example.> British officers sensibly took the view that the best and the most popular> solution would be to find local Iraqis who knew how to do it. Instead the US> has appointed an American company to take over the Iraqi asset. And guess> what? Stevedore Services of America who got the contract have a chairman known> for his donations to the Republican Party.” 33 While all this was going on in Iraq, American companies were being fined (veryquietly and virtually unreported in the media) under the Trading with the EnemyAct for doing business with ‘terrorist regimes’ named by the US government,including Iraq, Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Sudan. Fifty-seven companies wereinvolved and among them were Citigroup, Wal-Mart, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil andChevronTexaco, with connections to the Bushes, Cheney and Condoleezza Rice.ChevronTexaco was charged for trading with Iraq. The biggest fine, a quarter ofa million dollars, was imposed upon Zim American Israeli Shipping Co. ofNorfolk, Virginia., which is half owned by the Israeli government. This companyrelocated from the 16th floor of the World Trade Center just a week before theSeptember 11th attack.What liberation really meansMay 1st is a major day in the Illuminati Satanic ritual calendar in the periodcalled Beltane. It was no coincidence that this was the day when George Bushdeclared ‘victory’ in Iraq. The Vietnam draft-dodger appeared on the aircraftcarrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, off the California coast to use returningtroops as his stage prop. Tony Blair, ritually elected on May 1st 1997, alsospoke of ‘victory’. But what was this ‘victory’? And ‘victory’ for whom? Withthe invasion ‘completed’, this is what the people, who had been ‘liberated’,were left with:A brutal dictator was no longer in charge in Iraq, but a new one was, thinlydisguised as a ‘liberator’. Hundreds of thousands of civilian men, women andchildren were dead or maimed, along with tens of thousands of conscripts who hadno wish to fight anyone. Thousands of children were now orphans. One little boy,Ali, had no parents, no arms and a horrendously burned body because of US andBritish bombing and there were countless others who have suffered similarhorrors. US and British troops were killed and injured taking over a country forthe Illuminati, who see them as “dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns forforeign policy”. Civilians and soldiers in Iraq have died regularly ever since.The number of civilian deaths each month is horrific. Electricity and watersupplies were cut off across the country, including those to hospitals delugedwith casualties. Most hospitals were closed because of the bombing and thedanger for staff of travelling to work, and this when untold thousands neededurgent treatment. Iraq’s financial system was destroyed by the bombing and theorchestrated looting of banks, thus opening the way for a new US-imposed system.Iraqis lost their life savings, jobs and income. Others who spent their livesbuilding their businesses and homes have had them looted in the chaos that hasfollowed ‘liberation’. Depleted uranium and cluster bombs have been left by theUS and British air forces and will cause untold suffering in explosions,leukaemia and deformed births. Museums containing some of the world’s mostpriceless historical artefacts have been looted and burned and the mostimportant items will end up in the United States, some to be used in the humansacrifice rituals of these sick people who trace their bloodlines back to theland of Sumer and Babylon that is now Iraq. The United States oil cartel,through Cheney’s Halliburton, has control of the Iraqi oil, the second biggestreserves in the world. The US multinationals have control of Iraqi governmentadministration, industry and commerce. The US has the foothold in the Gulfregion that was planned in the Project for the New American Century document forthe Bush gang before he was illegally placed in power. Israel is also delightedwith the outcome. The United States are planning to choose a puppet to take overthe ‘civilian government’ and to maintain permanent military bases in Iraq toensure that everything is run their way and the Illuminati that controls theAmerican and British governments plan to use those countries for further massmurder in the Middle East and further afield. So what was this victory in Iraq?It was victory for the Illuminati agenda for a global fascist dictatorship;victory for the real perpetrators of 9/11.Baiting for GodNo exposure of the Illuminati techniques of mass manipulation would be completewithout a mention of religion. I have written at length in other books about theway the Illuminati created the religions and have played them off against eachother ever since to foster their policy of divide and rule and maintain thehuman mind in a state of denial and limitation. What is happening now with thefocus on Islam is but the latest example. As I write, Franklin Graham, son ofChristian fundamentalist, Billy Graham, is in the wings waiting to be ‘called’by ‘Gaaad’. Boy Graham wants to ‘save’ the Iraqis from their Islamic faith,which he calls “evil and wicked …” 34 With Graham rubbing bibles with peoplelike Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson (see Children of the Matrix), I bow to hissuperior talent for bigotry on such matters. Graham is a close friend of Bushand family and delivered the invocation at the idiot president’s illegalinauguration in 2001. Journalist Steven Waldman wrote: “I am not sure any ofthis means that America’s foreign policy objectives are served by having aBush-loving, Islam-bashing, Muslim-converting Christian icon on the ground inIraq tending to the bodies and souls of the grateful but deeply suspiciousMuslim population. Or, to put it more simply, the idea is absolutely loopy.” 35Well, unless you see the agenda it is. Boy Graham was asked to deliver a GoodFriday sermon at the Pentagon to the outrage of the Defense Department’s Muslimemployees and under Bush’s ‘Faith Based Initiative’, Graham’s ‘Samaritan’sPurse’ organisation stands to receive US government (taxpayer) funds for itsextreme form of Christian fundamentalism in Iraq. All the corruption andmanipulation revealed in the last few chapters are connected to the same end:destroying Islam, a unifying force for the Arab people they wish to conquer; andimposing their permanent control of government, military, banking, business,media and ‘education’ in the target countries. This is the blueprint to be usedwith all the nations that the Illuminati – via the British and Americangovernments – intend to absorb into their global empire. The Christianbelief-system is at the heart of so much manipulation of the American collectivemind. After appearing on a North American radio show to expose the agenda andquoting much of the information in these last few chapters, I received an emailfrom a listener. She said I was suffering from “extreme paranoia”. “Instead offocussing on one malevolent group such as the Illuminati – how about studyingthe Scriptures, which teach about the end times, and all that it will mean forus; and getting your heart right with God by accepting his gift of salvation?”She said she was angry that I could suggest that 9/11 was staged or allowed tooccur:> “I trust the present Administration – more than any other Administration that> I have seen in the US. He is a believer like I am, in Christ; and so are many> others in top positions there. Because I know ‘I’ can be trusted, I know that> when they say they aren’t lying to us – then we know that we can believe them.> I am offended by anyone who would attack the characters of Sec. Rumsfeld,> Pres. Bush, Vice Cheney, and others like them, on the White House and State> Dept. Staff.” Born again SatanistsThere are tens of millions like her in the United States unknowingly supportinga fascist dictatorship and believing that the child abusers, rapists, massmurderers and Satanic practitioners leading them to the cliff edge are“Christian”. How do they know? Only because that is what they are told. Thealleged “Christianity” of these people is merely voiced to fool the votersbecause they know that anyone who does not pledge allegiance to that faith willhave no chance of becoming president. I mean Clinton said it for goodness sake.And Blair also claims to be a dedicated Christian believer. Tom Foley, formerSpeaker of the House of Representatives, said:> “We are not a nation that prays in its closet. We expect the president to be> our principal preacher, to express constantly the idea that God has showered> us with special blessings, and that we, therefore, have a special identity, a> special mission in the world. It is a mission which is realised in part just> by being who we are, but which also requires us to encourage others to be just> like us.” 36 What chilling words they are. Here we have yet another nation believing they arethe chosen people of ‘God’, with not only the right, but the “mission”, toimpose, sorry “encourage”, others to be like them. The massive irony is,however, that America is not governed by Christians at all. In a powerfularticle headed “Bush’s ‘Christian’ Blood Cult”, the Washington investigativejournalist Wayne Madsen, rightly points out:> “… Bush and fellow self-anointed neo-Christians like House Majority Leader Tom> DeLay, John Ashcroft, and sports arena Book of Revelations carnival hawker> Franklin Graham appear to wallow in a ‘Christian’ blood lust cult when it> comes to practicing the teachings of the founder of Christianity.” 37 As we shall see, however, when you realise what the “Christian” religion isreally based upon, the term “blood lust cult” becomes perfectly appropriate.While he was Governor of Texas, Bush sanctioned a record 152 executions, 40 ofthem in the year 2000 as he ran for election as president. One of the Texasexecution ‘team’, Fred Allen, quit in disgust at the number of lethal injectionshe had to prepare, according to the Washington Post.38 Madsen says that he wastold by a former Texas Department of Public Safety officer, a devout RomanCatholic, that Bush was more than happy to ignore DNA data and documented casesof misconduct by the prosecution, to send innocent people to the lethalinjection chamber at Huntsville. The officer said the number of executedmentally retarded, African Americans, and those who committed capital crimes asminors, was proof that Bush was insensitive and a “phoney Christian”. Of coursehe is; they all are. Among Bush’s victims as governor was ‘fellow’ born-againChristian, Karla Faye Tucker, who led a prison ministry after being convicted ofmurder. When she asked for clemency, Bush rejected appeals from the Pope and theWorld Council of Churches and just mocked her. In an interview with Talkmagazine, Bush imitated Tucker’s appeal for him to spare her life – pursing hislips, squinting his eyes, and in a squeaky voice, saying, “Please don’t killme”. Former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer, an evangelicalChristian, said: “I think it is nothing short of unbelievable that the governorof a major state running for president thought it was acceptable to mock a womanhe decided to put to death.” 39 Unless you really know the Bush family, that is.I will explain in the next few chapters why these people can act so callouslywith no regard for life or suffering. They do not feel emotion the way most ofthe population does and there are reasons for this. They are involved in a bloodcult long exposed in my other books, but it certainly isn’t “Christian” in theway that word is perceived. The term ‘God’ is just another tool used by Bushspeechwriters to scam the American mind. Wayne Madsen writes:> “Bush has not once prayed for the innocent civilians who died as a result of> the US attack on Iraq. He constantly ‘embeds’ himself with the military at> Goebbels-like speech fests and makes constant references to God when he refers> to America’s ‘victory’ in Iraq, as if God endorses his sordid killing spree.> He makes no mention of the children, women, and old men killed by America’s> ‘precision-guided’ missiles and bombs and trigger-happy US troops. In fact,> Bush revels in indiscriminate blood letting. Since he never experienced such> killing in Southeast Asia, when he was AWOL from his Texas Air National Guard> unit, Bush just does not seem to understand the horror of a parent watching> one’s children having their heads and limbs blown off in a sudden blast of> shrapnel or children witnessing their parents burning to death with their own> body fat nurturing the flames.” 40 This is a man who targeted the Christian vote in a presidential ‘debate’ bysaying Jesus was his favourite philosopher. Or maybe that’s the only one he’sever heard of. The real George Bush, the ‘Christian believer’ in whom so manyput their faith, was eloquently described by Madsen:> “Bush, who fancies himself a ‘born-again’ Christian, is actually a> foul-mouthed and erratic alcoholic. For example, the ‘pretzel’ incident had> nothing to do with a pretzel. While watching a football game at the White> House, the ‘leader of the free world’ got so drunk he fell right on his face> and blamed it on his inability to remember his mother’s missive about chewing> all one’s food before swallowing. Such alibis and ruses are the trademarks of> drunks. During the presidential campaign Bush called a New York Times reporter> a ‘major league asshole.’ In 1986, a clearly drunk and disorderly Bush told> the Wall Street Journal’s Al Hunt, ‘You fucking son of a bitch … I saw what> you wrote. We’re not going to forget this’. The rich frat boy was irate about> an article Hunt wrote about Bush’s father. Time magazine is reporting that> during a March 2002 briefing for three senators by Condoleezza Rice, Bush> poked his head into a White House meeting room and bellowed, ‘Fuck Saddam.> We’re taking him out!’”41 Christianity is massively manipulated by the Illuminati. In fact, as I haveindicated, Christianity is one of the greatest forces of control in the UnitedStates and that makes wars against Muslims, Asians and Chinese so much easier tosell. Gentle Jesus wants us to kill those who do not believe in him as theirsaviour and he wants to subsidise Jewish settlements on Palestinian land inIsrael, as many fundamentalist congregations do. Typical of the hypocrisy thatequates “gentle Jesus” with mass murder, came from Captain Jimmy Nichols, thebattalion chaplain for 2-504 Parachute Infantry Regiment, who held a churchservice for US infantrymen in Afghanistan in which the key hymn was “Keep on theFiring Line”. Dressed in full combat gear, he launched into a sermon aboutSamson who, he said, was the “original tough guy, long before Rambo”, whose“super-strength” was a gift from God. He added that God had given them giftsalso. “You see, the reason that Samson is such a good story for folks like youand me in the military is that Samson is you, Samson is me.” 42 What a prat. Assomeone once said, the Christian world would be so much nicer if only moreChristians were like their Christ.Reich thinkingPro-Bush, pro-war, America is a deeply sick society. It is mentally andemotionally disturbed and mind-controlled to zombie proportions. How can it givefreedom to anyone when it does not have freedom itself? Not even freedom ofthought. A Knight Ridder poll in May 2003 claimed that a third of the Americanpublic believes US forces found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 22 percent thinks the Iraqis used chemical or biological weapons in the war. Beforethe conflict, half of those polled said Iraqis were among the 19 hijackers onSeptember 11th when, in fact, there were none in the FBI’s bogus list. “It’s astriking finding”, said Steve Kull, director of the Program on InternationalPolicy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, which conducted the poll. “Giventhe intensive news coverage and high levels of public attention”, he said, “thislevel of misinformation suggests some Americans may be avoiding having anexperience of cognitive dissonance.” 43 That is a long-winded way of sayingtheir beliefs conflict with the facts. They are mind-controlled, realitycontrolled, by the indoctrination of beliefs, political and religious. I will gointo this at length later because it is the bottom line of human control. WilsonBryan Key says in his book, The Age of Manipulation: “Humans are uniquelydangerous because their conceptual blindness does not allow them to know theyare dangerous.” 44 Today, that applies to America more than anywhere on Earth.Every day it is more obvious that the ‘F’ word is precisely what we are facing:fascism. After the horrors of the mid-20th century they said it could neverhappen again. Well it is happening again and, below the surface, it never wentaway. We are, as I have been predicting for more than a decade, fast heading fora global version of Nazi Germany. Barry Steinhardt, director of the Americancivil liberties union programme on technology and liberty, told the New YorkTimes that the authorities are demanding records from Internet providers andlibraries about what books people are taking out and the websites they’relooking at.45 Under a planned bill called the Domestic Security Enhancement Act,the government could withhold the identity of anyone detained in connection witha ‘terror investigation’ and their names would be exempt from the Freedom ofInformation act, according to the Washington-based advocacy group, the Centrefor Public Integrity.46 I have detailed in books like Alice in Wonderland andthe World Trade Center Disaster the staggering extent to which our freedoms havealready been destroyed since September 11th 2001 and most people have no ideahow far this has gone. Fascists do not have to wear a swastika on their arm. Whosaid this?> “An evil exists that threatens every man, woman, and child of this great> nation. We must take steps to ensure our domestic security and protect our> homeland.” Who was it? Bush? Cheney? Rumsfeld? Powell? Blair? Yes, they have all expressedthose sentiments since September 11th to justify the militarisation of lawenforcement and destruction of freedom under the guise of ‘Homeland Security’.But they did not speak those words. They came from the mouth of Adolf Hitlerwhen he was announcing the creation of the Gestapo in Nazi Germany. Americansociety today is being manipulated into the same mind-controlled state to whichmuch of the German population succumbed in the 1930s and 1940s. “I love Adolf,he’s just the kind of leader Germany needs” – “I love George, he’s just the kindof leader America needs.” There is no difference between them in method oroutcome. But, as with Bush supporters in America today, the Hitler-supportingGermans could not see through the smokescreens and the Orwellian Newspeak untilit was too late to turn the tide of hatred and control. We are such a long waydown the Orwellian road, but although the majority still can’t see it, the firesof freedom are stirring in the hearts of those with minds to call their own.Note that I said “pro-Bush, pro-war” America was a deeply sick society. I knowfrom personal experience that vast millions of Americans are not mentally andemotionally challenged like their president. They are seeing the game and theyare appalled by it, as gathering billions are in Britain and around the world.America is not Bush and Britain is not Blair. Beyond the mesmerised and themind-dead that buy the Bush- Blair lies and delusion, many are waking up andseeking to challenge the Gestapo in Washington and London as their most basicfreedoms are removed by the week in the name of a war on terrorism that isnothing more than a manufactured excuse – like 9/11 – to follow a long-plannedagenda for global dictatorship.There you have just some of the background to the global conspiracy and how ithas played out since September 11th. I have concentrated on the war in Iraqbecause of its relevance to current events and because it is a wonderful exampleof the Illuminati methodology used to manipulate the people every day. There isthe secret agenda and there is the movie to hide that agenda from the people.The agenda is the creation of a global fascist state of centralised dictatorshipand constant control and surveillance, with a world government, central bank,currency and army dictating to a microchipped population. The movie is thatChristian-believers in the White House and Downing Street are fightingterrorism, protecting the people, and freeing the world from tyranny. I havebeen bashing out this message at every opportunity for well over a decade, oftenin the face of enormous ridicule and condemnation. I have been called a“nutter”, a “racist”, a “hatemonger”, and been laughed at in the street all overBritain. But with people looking fascism in the face and seeing that what waspredicted is now coming to pass, far fewer are finding it funny.What I have described in these last few chapters is the five-sense level of theconspiracy, that which directly effects our daily experience in this ‘world’. AsI walked my journey of discovery, however, I was to see that the story is muchbigger than that – vastly so. Bush, Blair and all these other ‘human’ leadersand power brokers are themselves pawns in a much greater game. They are thepieces, not the puzzle.SOURCES > 1 BBC News Online, May 6th 2003> 2 “White House Wants Baker to Head Iraq Reconstruction, Unresolved Whether> Baker or Bremer Would have Final Word”, by Mike Allen and Glenn Kessler,> Washington Post, July 25th 2003> 3 Ibid> 4 “Carving Up The New Iraq”, by Neil Mackay, Sunday Herald, Scotland,> http://www.Sundayherald.com/33021 [http://www.Sundayherald.com/33021]> 5 Ibid> 6 Associated Press, April 16th 2003> 7 Ibid> 8 Statement by Treasury Secretary John Snow in advance of meetings of the G7,> IMF and World Bank, April 10th 2003, issued by US Office of Public Affairs> 9 “US Urges World Bank to Aid Iraq”, BBC News Online, April 11th 2003> 10 “Carving Up The New Iraq”, by Neil Mackay, Sunday Herald, Scotland,> http://www.Sundayherald.com/33021 [http://www.Sundayherald.com/33021]> 11 “Awarding Iraq Policing Contract To Rapists, Sex-Slave Traders, and Frauds,> Let there be peace”, April 17th 2003,> http://www.lettherebepeace.blogspot.com/2003_04_13_lettherebepeace_archive.html> [http://www.lettherebepeace.blogspot.com/2003_04_13_lettherebepeace_archive.html]> 12 Ibid> 13 “U.S. Firms Secretly Bid to Uphold Law in Iraq”, Los Angeles Times, April> 18th 2003,> http://www.latimes.com/classified/jobs/news/la-fi-cops18apr18,0,1704126.story?coll=la-class-employ-jobnews> [http://www.latimes.com/classified/jobs/news/la-fi-cops18apr18,0,1704126.story?coll=la-class-employ-jobnews]> 14 Ibid> 15 “Eyes On America” by Jonathan Ashley, October 9th 2001,> http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/0662.Bush.Saudi.htm> [http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/0662.Bush.Saudi.htm]> http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/0662.Bush.Saudi.htm> [http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/0662.Bush.Saudi.htm])> 16 Ibid> 17 Ibid> 18 http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0141/gray.php> [http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0141/gray.php]> http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0141/gray.php> [http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0141/gray.php]> 19 BBC News Online, April 17th 2003,> http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2957875.stm> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2957875.stm]> 20 “The Contractors”, New Yorker, May 5th, 2003> 21 Ibid> 22 “Halliburton job bigger than thought, Army says $7 B contract to repair> Iraq’s oil fields includes operations and oil distribution”, CNN website, May> 7th 2003> 23 Ibid> 24 http://www.halliburton.com [http://www.halliburton.com]> 25 More details at http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/02.01E.Cheney.Hussein.htm> [http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/02.01E.Cheney.Hussein.htm]> 26 International Herald Tribune, July 2000> 27> http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-08-25/pols_feature2.html> [http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-08-25/pols_feature2.html]> 28 See “The Candidate From Brown and Root” by Robert Bryce, August 28th 2000,> http://multihome.www.desert.net [http://multihome.www.desert.net]> http://multihome.www.desert.net [http://multihome.www.desert.net]> 29 Ronnie Dugger, The Politician: The Life and Times of Lyndon Johnson,> (Norton, 1982)> 30 http://www.nexusmagazine.com/bushcheney.html> [http://www.nexusmagazine.com/bushcheney.html]> 31 Balochistan Post, Pakistan, April 15th 2003> 32 BBC News Online, April 17th 2003,> http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2957875.stm> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2957875.stm]> 33 Sunday Mirror, March 30th 2003> 34 “Franklin Graham’s Mistake”, Christopher Ruddy Monday, November 19th 2001> 35 “Jesus in Baghdad, Why we should keep Franklin Graham out of Iraq”, by> Steven Waldman, April 11th 2003, http://slate.msn.com/ [http://slate.msn.com/]> 36 Daily Telegraph, June 16th 2003> 37 Bush’s ‘Christian’ Blood Cult, Concerns Raised by the Vatican, by Wayne> Madsen> 38 Washington Post, October 2000> 39 Bush’s ‘Christian’ Blood Cult, Concerns Raised by the Vatican, by Wayne> Madsen> 40 Ibid> 41 “Berating the Generals”, The Siege of Washington, by Wayne Madsen,> http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen03312003.html> [http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen03312003.html]> 42 “Afghanistan after the war bodes ill for Iraq, Living in poverty and fear> of abandonment, the barely functioning state that trusted its saviours”, by> Phil Reeves in Kabul The Independent (UK), 24 February 2003> 43 “Poll shows errors in beliefs on Iraq, 9/11.

It was clear to me by then that (a) this conspiracyhad to go back a long way and (b) there obviously had to be some unifying forcethat was coordinating events through the generations.Quite understandably, people ask why, if the conspiracy goes back at leastthousands of years, Illuminati operatives would have given their livesthroughout that period to achieving global control when they knew they would notbe around to see it? There is an answer to that question and I began toappreciate what it was when an apparently bizarre new theme entered my research:reptilian shape-shifters. Yes, I know, but stay with me a while. I began tofollow the conspiracy ‘back’ into history searching for the origin of theIlluminati and their agenda of global conquest. I got comfortably back to thetime of the Crusades in the thirteenth century in the so-called ‘Holy Land’ andthe elite secret societies established in that period like the Knights Templar,Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem, which now hastwo main arms known as the Knights of Malta (official head the Pope) and theKnights or Order of St John of Jerusalem (official head the British monarch).These secret societies are still Illuminati operations with some of the world’smost powerful people among their initiates, including Queen Elizabeth II. Icontinued to go back from the Crusade era and I was thousands of years BC beforeI found anything like a starting point to the Illuminati agenda. It was not, infact, the origin, which lies way back with the advanced civilisations known asAtlantis and Lemuria or Mu, and even earlier. These lands were believed to belocated in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and were destroyed by enormouscataclysmic events that started perhaps some 11,000 years ago (see The BiggestSecret). But there is a later point where you can pick up the story, around4,000 to 2,000 BC in Sumer, now Iraq, in the “Land Between the Rivers” calledMesopotamia.Image [../Images/00023.jpg]Figure 18: The three highly advanced cultures of Sumer, Egypt and the IndusValley. All were part of the Sumer Empire, as documented by L.A. Waddell Sumer or laterSumer is known as the ‘cradle of civilisation’ to conventional history becauseit was so advanced. The Sumerians were the first known people to study thestars, develop the written word and enforce a legal code. It was the artefacts,texts and records from Sumer and its successors in that land, like the Assyriansand Babylonians, that were so professionally and systematically looted or burnedafter the Fourth Reich’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. The British writer andanthropologist, L.A. Waddell, produced a series of brilliant books about Sumerand other ancient cultures. He was an expert in Sumerian and Egyptianhieroglyphics and the Sanskrit language of the Indus Valley in India. This was arare gift indeed and it allowed him to travel these regions, reading the ancientaccounts on the temples and monuments, and see that Sumer, Egypt and the IndusValley were parts of one empire based on Sumer (Figure 18). See The BiggestSecret and Children of the Matrix for more of this background and Waddell’s workis documented in detail in his book, Egyptian Civilisation, Its Sumerian OriginAnd Real Chronology.1 Waddell also shows in his work, Makers of Civilisation,2that the Sumer-centred empire extended not only to the Indus Valley in the east,but to the British Isles in the west and encompassed much in between. It waslarger than that of Alexander the Great or the Romans. The Sumer Empire includeda large part of the world and it is from this same information source that allof the major religions have emerged. From where did Christianity, Judaism,Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and others like Zoroasterism, etc., emerge? The Middleand Near East and the vast region ruled at one time from Sumer; and it continuedto be dominated by that knowledge base and belief system in the thousands ofyears that followed Sumer’s demise. The story of King Sargon, the Akkadian kingwho conquered Sumer, is an excellent example. They said that his mother bore himin secret and floated him in a basket on the River Euphrates, where he was foundand brought up by a royal family.3 The Israelite/Hebrews, or rather theirmanipulating priests, the Levites, later took this ancient story from theMesopotamian accounts and used it in the story of Moses. The Old Testament isfounded on Sumerian and Egyptian accounts, edited and rewritten as required, tocreate a manufactured history and religion called Judaism. The New Testament isbased on literal and symbolic stories repeated over and over in the thousands ofyears before it was compiled and these relate to a large extent to the Sumerianand Egyptian religion of Sun worship and Mystery school rituals. The NewTestament texts, in turn, created a manufactured religion and history calledChristianity. King Sargon was a major Sun worshipper and these rulers of theSumer Empire were given the title, “Son of the Sun”.4 To the Sumerians, the Sunwas a symbol of ‘God’ and from this came the title Son of the Sun or Son of God.Sumerian emperors were also often known as “The One Lord”. You find the samestory in Egypt because the two cultures were so connected.Waddell discovered from the time lines and the descriptions of the leaders andtheir genealogy that the rulers of these three great cultures, Sumer, Egypt andthe Indus Valley were, at least in one period, the same people under differentnames. It is the different names that have obscured the truth to a large extent.Historians have taken different names to mean different people, but this is notcorrect. The endless ‘gods’ in the various cultures also turn out to bedifferent names for the same deities. Once you understand this, wading into thepast becomes a lot less complicated. The advantage that Waddell had overconventional Egyptologists and ‘historians’ (apart from an open mind) was thathe could read Sumerian and could decipher inscriptions in Egypt, which theycould not understand. He could see that early Egyptian hieroglyphics were thoseused by their ruling culture in Sumer. It was only later that they evolved intoan Egyptian system developed more locally. It is the latter that Egyptologistshave been decoding. The earlier Sumerian hieroglyphics in Egypt flummoxed them,but not Waddell. Here is one example of how he proved his point. The Sumeriansrecorded that King “basket on the river” Sargon had a son called Manis, wholater became emperor. At the same time, Waddell shows, the son of the king inthe Indus Valley was known as Manja, and in Egypt he was called Manj(abbreviated to Man) – the guy known to the Greeks as Menes and to EnglishEgyptologists as Mena.5 So we have the ruler’s son, and later ruler, in Sumer,Egypt and the Indus Valley in the same period called variously, Manis, Manj andManja. The reason becomes obvious – it was the same bloke. Even the title givento him was the same or very similar in all three places. In Egypt he was knownas Manj-the-Warrior; in Sumer he was Manis-the-Warrior; and in the Indus Valleyhe was called Manja-the-Shooter.6His father, Sargon the Great, is a Semitic name for the Sumerian-Mesopotamianemperor, King Gin, Gani, or Guni. The Sumer Empire was so large that in thelater Babylonian texts he is called the “King of the Four Quarters of theWorld”. The Incas of South America also used this term “Four Quarters”. In theancient Indian epics, Sargon’s son, Manja, was called “The Royal Eye of Goptaand of the Four Ends of the Earth” when he became emperor.7 In Egypt, India (atthe Taj Mahal, for example) and the Christian world you also find the fourpillar symbolism representing the pillars that hold up the heavens. In the IndusValley clay seal records, Sargon and Manja or Menes also called themselves andtheir dynasty Gut or Got (‘Goth’ to the Romans) and used the titles Bar or Parwhich means ‘pharaoh’, according to Waddell.8 Gut or Got became ‘God’, a termused by the later Goths. All non- Latin languages in Europe are derived from theGothic, including English, and the ancient Swedish language is still called“Sueo-Gothic”.9 The former name for Denmark was “Goth-land” and a derivative wasJut-land.10 Gothic architecture, so beloved of the bloodlines and theIlluminati, comes from the same source and so does the horned headgear worn bythe kings and leaders of European tribes and kingdoms. But these symbols, stylesand customs go back much further to the technologically advanced globalcivilisations known as Atlantis and Lemuria or Mu. The Illuminati KnightsTemplar used the ‘Gothic’ style of architecture when they built the great‘Christian’ cathedrals of Europe, which are full of Pagan symbolism and locatedon ancient Pagan sacred sites. The symbolism of the ‘Eye of Gopta’ may relate tothe widely used Illuminati symbol, the all-seeing eye or Eye of Horus, which youwill find at the top of the pyramid on the US dollar bill and on the reverse ofthe Great Seal of the United States (Figure 19). It certainly represents theforce behind the Illuminati. The symbols used by the ancient Sumerian,Babylonian and Egyptian dynasties are still used by the Illuminati today becausethey are the same bloodlines and are working with the same knowledge, which hasbeen hidden away since ancient times within the Mystery school and secretsociety networks.Image [../Images/00024.jpg]Figure 19: The ancient Illuminati symbol of the Pyramid and All-Seeing-Eye onthe dollar bill. The raised capstone represents the unseen force thatmanipulates the pyramid Origins of the bloodlineI knew by the time I was researching the Sumer period that the Illuminati wasobsessed with genetics and obsessively interbred for some reason. The samebloodlines have been installed in the positions of political and economic powerfor thousands of years. First they were the royalty and nobility of the ancientsand now they are the leading politicians, bankers, businessmen and media ownersof modern society. So what was it with this bloodline stuff? The Sumerianaccounts of their history were to offer an answer.Sumer began at the peak of its powers and then gradually declined, indicating agreat input of knowledge at the start that was later lost. The Sumerians hadtheir own explanations for the origin of this knowledge and their records wererediscovered thousands of years later. In the mid-1800s and later, tens ofthousands of clay tablets were found in the former land of Sumer on the site ofthe Assyrian capital city of Nineveh near what is today Mosul in Iraq. AnEnglishman, Sir Austen Henry Layard, made this first discovery and others havefollowed. The astonishing accounts the tablets contain originated in Sumer andnot with the later Assyrian culture. Therefore, I refer to them as the SumerianTablets. It is estimated that they were buried around 2000bc, but they tell astory that goes back long before to the lost civilisations of Atlantis andLemuria or Mu and even further. In more recent times many books have beenwritten translating the content of the Tablets and you don’t have to delve intothe translations for long to see that much of the Biblical Old Testament is anedited rewrite of these Sumerian stories. Besides the floating basket story ofKing Sargon, the Tablets describe the Great Flood and a place called E.DIN (“TheAbode of the Righteous Ones”). The Bible speaks of Eden, the garden of ‘God’.The story of Genesis is a summary of the same basic story told in the SumerianTablets in far more detail. Interestingly, many of the terms translated into theEnglish version of the Old Testament as ‘God’ come from words that actually mean‘gods’, plural, and the Sumerians said the founders of their civilisation were arace of beings that came to this planet from elsewhere bringing great knowledgeand technology. They called these beings the Anunna. Their later Semitic namewas AN.UNNAK.KI (“Those who from Heaven to Earth Came”) and DIN.GIR (“TheRighteous Ones of the Blazing Rockets”). Anunna means “Sons of An” (later Anu),the ‘king’ of the Anunna/Anunnaki.11 The name for Sumer in the tablets isKI.EN.GIR, which has been translated as “The Land of the Lord of the BlazingRockets” and also “The Land of the Watchers”. The term ‘Watchers’ is often usedto describe ancient ‘gods’. The Egyptian name for their gods, the Neteru,translates literally as ‘Watchers’. The Egyptians said that these Watchers camein their ‘heavenly boats’ and in ancient cultures across the world you have thisconstantly recurring theme of ‘gods’ arriving in some kind of flying machine tofound civilisations and bring knowledge and techniques that were light yearsahead of what existed before.In the Indian culture they called the flying craft Vimanas and there wereseveral designs. Some were cigar-shaped while others were described asdouble-decked with a dome and porthole windows. Both types are regularlydescribed in UFO sightings today. The ancient Indian texts describe anti-gravitytechnology of the type used in ‘flying saucers’. So much so that when theChinese discovered Sanskrit documents in Tibet and sent them to the Universityof Chandrigarh for translation, they were found to contain the knowledge tobuild interstellar spaceships, according to the University’s Dr Ruth Reyna.12Yet the documents are thousands of years old! Dr Reyna revealed that these shipswere known as “Astras” and it was claimed they could fly to any planet. Sometexts talk about them flying to the Moon. Details of building, flying, andoperating the craft are all included. The Chinese, apparently, even used part ofthe contents in their space programme.13The Sumerian Tablets describe planets of the solar system in both number andenvironment in ways that were only confirmed in the twentieth century. Theydescribe how the Anunnaki, later called ‘gods’, created a culture of greatadvancement and technology that was destroyed by Earth catastrophes and flood.The story of the Biblical Great Flood is told at length in the Tablets thousandsof years before the Bible appeared. The Sumerian flood hero, Utnapishtim, wasreplaced by the name, Noah, when the much later texts of Genesis were compiledfrom the Sumerian records. The most astonishing information in the Sumerian claytablets are the detailed descriptions of how the Anunnaki interbred with humansto create a hybrid race, a fusion of the genes of humans and the ‘gods’. Yetagain this is a constantly repeated theme in every part of the world and can beseen in the Old Testament narrative, taken from the Sumerian, of the Sons of God(properly translated, the sons of the gods) who interbred with humanity andcreated a hybrid bloodline. Genesis recounts:> “When men began to increase in number on the Earth and daughters were born to> them, the sons of God [the gods] saw that the daughters of men were beautiful,> and they married any of them they chose … The Nefilim were on the Earth in> those days – and also afterwards – when the sons of God [the gods] went to the> daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, the> men of renown.” 14 The term Nefilim can be translated as “Those Who Descended” or “Those Who FellFrom The Heavens”. The American researcher, David Sielaff, emphasises that theNefilim or Nephilim are not the sons of the gods (beni ha-Elohim), but theoffspring of the interbreeding between the “daughters of men” and the non-humansthe Bible calls the Elohim. The Illuminati bloodlines that rule the world todayare the Nefilim, a race of human/non-human hybrids. They were also known inancient times as the Rephaim, Emim, Zazummim and Anakim, and they were all verytall or ‘giant’ people in those days.15 The Biblical Goliath was a Rephaim andgiant in Hebrew is repha.16 This theme of giants is a constant one. Cavepaintings found in places like Japan, South America and the Sahara Desert,depict giant people with round heads towering over human hunters. Bones of giantpeople between 8 and 12 feet tall have been found in mounds in Minnesota andother locations. The Delaware Indians speak of a race of giants who once livedeast of the Mississippi in enormous cities and the same descriptions of giantsin ancient legends and lore can be found everywhere.17 Scores of giantred-haired mummies were discovered in a cave near Lovelock in Nevada and somewere seven feet tall.18 The Piute Indian legends about these giants say theywere cannibals. They would even dig up the Piute dead from their graves and eatthem, the accounts claim.19 Stories of Atlantis include tales of red-hairedgiants who acted like vampires, and the giant Nefilim were associated withcannibalism and blood drinking – just like the Illuminati bloodlines are today.Most accounts say that these giants were unfriendly, even hostile, to the restof the population. Often associated with the giants are strange craft that soundvery much like the ‘flying saucers’ of modern UFO accounts. Genesis tells usthat the sons of the gods married the daughters of men before the flood, as wellas afterwards, and Numbers calls the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, or descendantsof the Anakim (Anunnaki).20Hero worshipAccording to scholar Zecharia Sitchin, who has written many books on theSumerian Tablets, the term “men of renown” in the Genesis passage should read,from its Sumerian origin, “men of the sky vehicles”. This puts rather adifferent complexion on the whole story and makes a great deal more sense of it.The reference to “heroes of old” is also relevant. The word hero comes from theEgyptian term, heru, which, according to researcher Wallis Budge, was “appliedto the king as a representative of the Sun God on Earth”.21 The precise meaningwas “a human being who was neither a god nor a daemon”.22 The term has theinference of a crossbreed race. The writer Homer (8th-9th century BC) wrote that“the heroes were exalted above the race of common men”. The poet, Pindar,(518-438 BC) used the term, “hero/heru”, to describe a race “between gods andmen”. Flavius Josephus, the first century writer and historian, said this of theGenesis reference to the interbreeding between ‘gods’ and human women:> “… for many angels of God accompanied with women and begat sons that proved> unjust, and despisers of all that was good, on account of the confidence they> had in their own strength; for the tradition is, that these men did what> resembled the acts of those whom the Grecians call giants.” 23 The term ‘angel’, which means messenger, became associated with these non-humanentities that interbred with humans. The Sumerian Tablets go much further thanGenesis in explaining the interbreeding of ‘gods’ and humans. They describe howthe Anunnaki set out to create a slave race, later called Homo sapiens, to servetheir agenda and how they began this quest, amid much trial and error, usingwhat we call today test-tube methods. This is described in the Tablets and youcan read the accounts in detail in the books of Zecharia Sitchin.24 The Tabletstell of how the sperm of Anunnaki males was used to fertilise human eggs beforethey were transplanted to Anunnaki females to be birthed. All this appears tohave first happened hundreds of thousands of years ago, but has continued eversince on various scales. I think many of the stories mentioned in the Tabletsrefer to events in Lemuria and Atlantis. All this makes more understandable thecountless stories told today by people claiming to have been abducted bynon-human entities that forced them to have sex or took their eggs. The babiesthat result often disappear in early pregnancy with no medical explanation. Ofcourse, there are many ‘abduction’ experiences that are simply invented or haveother, more earthly, explanations; but to dismiss them all, given their numberand often consistency of detail around the world, would be just as ridiculous asbelieving every word of every one.Let’s hear it for LuluThe Sumerian Tablets tell of how the original breeding programme was headed bythe chief scientist of the Anunnaki, called Enki, or “Lord of the Earth” (Ki =Earth), and their expert in medicine, Ninkharsag, also known as Ninti (“LadyLife”). Mesopotamian depictions portray her holding a horseshoe-shaped tool usedat that time to cut the umbilical cord. Another name later given to her wasMammi, from which came mama and mother. Mama or ma as a term for mother can befound in various languages all over the world. Ninkharsag would later besymbolised in part by the stream of mother goddess deities with names like QueenSemiramis, Isis, Barati, Artemis, Diana and the Biblical Mary. These were alsoused to symbolise the feminine principle as goddesses of the Moon or waters,which are considered the feminine balance to the masculine Sun.After many failures and some horrendous creations, the Tablets indicate, Enkiand Ninkharsag produced a human hybrid that the Sumerians called a LU.LU (“OneWho Has Been Mixed”) – which appears to be the Biblical “Adam”. This was thesplicing together of the DNA of the Anunnaki with that of the human form knownas Homo erectus. Some of these hybrids were designed to rule as the ‘middle men’or ‘demi-gods’ between the Anunnaki and the people. What the Bible calls “Adam”,the ‘first man’, is likely to be symbolic of “the Adam”, a genetic stream not anindividual. The Biblical “Eve” was supposed to have been created from a rib ofAdam, but the word from which “rib” derived was the Sumerian, TI, which meansboth rib and life according to the translations of Zecharia Sitchin. To becreated from the “life” or life essence of the Adamic race makes rather moresense than a rib. In the same way, the “dust from the ground” from which theBible claims that Adam was created, really translates as “that which is life”from the Sumerian term, TI.IT. So Adam was a bit of a TI.IT. Appropriately, theSumerian name for humans was LU, which has the root meaning of worker or servantand also implies a domesticated animal like a sheep. Does that not describe thenature of human life today and for a long time past? My own research leads me tothink that the claims that the Anunnaki created the human form as we know it allover the world are exaggerated. There have been many examples of interbreedingbetween humanity and the extraterrestrial ‘gods’ of various origins and racesand not just the Anunnaki. It was more that the Anunnaki created DNA streams orbloodlines to suit their agenda and they have continued to infuse their DNA intohuman blood streams. They seek to rewire the DNA to close down humanity’sinterdimensional communication and telepathic powers. This puts us in avibrational prison in which most can perceive only the very narrow frequencyrange accessed by our physical senses. Official history says that certain humanforms died out to be followed by new ones and thus Neanderthal man was followedby Cro-Magnon man and then Homo sapiens or modern man. But archaeologistsworking in the Middle East have discovered evidence to show that all thesephysical forms existed during the same period. The ‘missing link’ that wouldconnect them and explain the sudden and dramatic changes and appearance of theirphysical forms has never been found because the establishment of academia wouldrather stay ignorant than utter the ‘E’ word – extraterrestrial. The theme ofroyal families claiming the right to rule because their bloodline was seeded bythe gods is a constant one all over the world, not least in Sumer and Egypt, andthis is the origin of the Illuminati bloodlines.The ‘Israelite’ pharoahsGiven the significance that the Illuminati gives to ancient Egypt and the GreatPyramid at Giza (not least on the dollar bill), you would expect an Egyptianconnection – and there is. I should stress here, however, that what we callEgypt was not the first civilisation in those lands. In the tens of thousands ofyears before the emergence of the Egypt we know from the official history books,this land was called Khemit (I have seen a number of spellings). Khemitconnected with the advanced civilisations of Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria thatexisted before the vast ‘Great Flood’ cataclysms of around 11,500 BC (see TheBiggest Secret) They were all part of a global society. The word Kh’met inEgyptian means “The Black Land”, and this is said to refer to the dark, richsoil laid down on the banks of the Nile by the yearly floods. (Deshr’et means“The Red Land”, from which comes the word ‘desert’.) I have also heard the viewthat The Black Land refers to a black population. The pharaohs of Egypt claimedthe right to rule because they were children of the gods and they were anotherexpression of the bloodline seeded around the world to rule on behalf of these‘gods’. This Egyptian royal line is seriously important to the Illuminati and ithas survived intact to the modern era. In more recent years the official historyof the Jewish people has been questioned by a number of authors and researcherswho have no motive whatsoever except to establish the truth. In previous books,I have connected a people known as the Hyksos to the Biblical Israelites and, asI was completing this work, I came across a series of extremely interestingbooks by the British author, Ralph Ellis.25 He has focussed especially on theEgypt connection to the ‘royal’ bloodlines and the Hyksos are at the heart ofhis research. The Hyksos are known by history as either the “Shepherd Kings” or“Rulers of Foreign Lands” depending in the translation and are said to haveinvaded Egypt about 1720 to 1650 BC, again depending on which account you read.They produced a number of pharaohs or “priest kings” who were initiated into thesecrets in the Great Pyramid and the Mystery school dedicated to the Sun atHeliopolis (called On in the Bible). The Hyksos Dynasty ruled from Avaris (hencethe word ‘avarice’ meaning greedy) in the eastern delta (see Figure 20). Irecommend Ralph Ellis’s books for a wealth of detail, but in summary he saysthat the great figures of ‘Jewish’ history, like Abraham, King David and KingSolomon were pharaohs of the Egyptian royal line that claimed to be descendedfrom the ‘gods’. I don’t share all of his conclusions and I offer myinterpretation of events at the end of the chapter, but his general themes aresupported very much by my own research: a bloodline and its associated secretknowledge came out of Egypt with the leaders of the Biblical Israelites.Image [../Images/00025.jpg]Figure 20: Ancient Egypt at the time of the Hyksos (courtesy of Ralph Ellis fromhis book, Tempest and Exodus) As I have highlighted before, you search in vain for historical evidence outsidethe Bible for the characters known as Abraham, David, Solomon and Moses. Equallylacking is the archaeological evidence to support the Old Testament tales likethe mass exodus of the Israelite people from bondage in Egypt during the periodit supposed to have happened. This is ludicrous given the scale of the allegedevents and the apparent stature of these people and the feats for which theywere supposed to have been responsible. Quite simply, they did not exist intheir Biblical form. But Ellis presents evidence that the story does start tomake sense if you relocate them to Egypt and the pharaohs of the Hyksos, the“Shepherd Kings” or “Rulers of Foreign Lands”. These were supposed to be apeople from Western Asia, which includes the lands of modern Turkestan in thenorth, Afghanistan in the east, the Mediterranean Sea in the west and thepresent Iran and Iraq in the south – the land of Sumer and Babylon. I think theHyksos bloodline came from Sumer for reasons I will outline later. Two of theSumer monarchs in their king lists were called “Shepherd Kings” and theSumer/Egyptian religions were virtually identical. The Egyptian Sun God calledRa was Shamash in Mesopotamia and both were depicted as a winged Sun-disk (asymbol often used by the Illuminati today). The Hebrew word for Sun is“Shemesh”26 and so were the sons of “Shem” really sons of the Sun? That is aterm you find in ancient Egypt, as in sons of Ra. When we speak of Egypt we arealso speaking of Sumer and Mesopotamia because the two are fundamentallyconnected. As Ralph Ellis writes:> “The historical record of Sumer runs substantially parallel to that of Egypt,> dating back to some 3000 BC, with king lists much the same as to be found in> Egypt. Historically, it would appear that at some point in history, elements> of the Sumerian culture sailed across to Egypt and that the first dynasty> kings of Egypt, therefore, had much in common with the Sumerian peoples.” 27 Bull-sheepEllis’s research leads him to conclude that the Hyksos never invaded Egypt fromanywhere. They were already there. He says that the Hyksos were Egyptians whobegan to follow the religion of the ‘sheep’ when the astrological age of Arieswas proclaimed to have started by the priests at the Mystery school atHeliopolis – the Biblical “On”. He says this caused massive conflict with those,including the reigning Pharaoh, who supported the continuation of the worship ofthe ‘bull’ or the era of Taurus. Ellis writes that this ‘sheep’ v ‘bull’religious conflict is the coded meaning of the “Shepherd Kings” (which hebelieves is the true translation of their title) and the countless references tosheep, shepherds, “good shepherds” and cattle in the symbol-sodden Biblestories. Genesis, for example, says that the patriarch Jacob … “did separate thelambs … and he put all his flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’scattle”.28 In the same way, when the age of Aries gave way to Pisces in theperiod related by the New Testament the codes begin to move from shepherds andsheep to fishes and “fishers of men”. Today we are in the transition from Piscesto Aquarius. Ellis says that Abraham, the Biblical ‘father’ of the Jewish andIslamic peoples, did not come from the lands of Mesopotamia as the Biblecontends, but was instead the son of an Egyptian pharaoh. Abraham became thefirst Hyksos Pharaoh, Ellis suggests, when the Aries followers, or “Arians”, ashe calls them, seized Lower Egypt, which included the Great Pyramid at Giza andthe Mystery school at Heliopolis, the City of the Sun. Upper Egypt continued tofollow the old religion with its centre at Thebes, Ellis says. What is for sureis that the Old Testament stories about the Israelite heroes being poorshepherds are baloney. These were seriously connected people, as Ellis shows,and this royal line that came out of Egypt is the reason for the Old Testamentobsession with genealogy and all those ‘begats’. He says Abraham was a Hyksospharaoh called Sheshi, whose throne name was Mayebre or Mayebra. Switch the Maround, he says, and you have a perfect phonetic match for Abram who becameAbraham of the Bible. M-aye-bra = Ay-bra-ham:> “Neither shall thy name be called Abram, but your name shall be called> Abraham; for a father of many nations I have made thee. And I shall make thee> exceedingly fruitful … and kings shall come out of thee.” 29 Abraham’s son known as Isaac in the Bible was the Hyksos pharaoh called Anather,says Ellis, and Isaac’s son, Jacob, was really the pharaoh whose throne name wasJacobaam. Jacob is the Biblical patriarch who was said to have had twelve sonsthat founded the “twelve tribes of Israel”. Ralph Ellis contends that theBiblical exodus of the ‘Israelites’ was actually a story that combined two massevacuations from Egypt by the Hyksos and their followers. The major one, hesays, happened in the 16th century BC when the conflict between the Upper andLower Egyptian religions, the bull and the sheep, led to the people of ‘Abraham’leaving to settle in Palestine at the time of the Hyksos pharaoh, Yakobaam orJacobaam (Jacob). According to the Egyptian historian, Manetho,30 they numbered240,000 families and the first century Jewish writer, Josephus, described thefleeing Hyksos as “our ancestors”.31 They left for Canaan, disguised by theBiblical texts as Israelites, and sacked Jerusalem.The Hyksos royal line returned to Egypt, says Ellis, with the Biblical ‘Joseph’.He writes that the Genesis “coat of many colours” story, when Joseph was sold byhis jealous brothers and taken to Egypt, is symbolic of the return of thebloodline from exile in Canaan. While ‘Joseph’ was not the first born accordingto the story, he was the first born of his father Jacob’s ‘chief wife’ calledRachel. Thus he was the heir. This relates to the bloodline being passed onthrough the female. It is the DNA of the mother, not the father, who decides the‘purity’ of the genes from the ‘royal’ point of view. The Illuminati follow thesame principle to this day and the ‘chief wife’ or ‘first wife’ symbolismcontinues with titles like ‘First Lady’ for the wife of an American president.The Biblical story goes that Joseph became ‘vizier’ or chief minister to thepharaoh and the Old Testament tells us that he married the daughter of a priestat the Hyksos sacred Mystery school at Heliopolis. His wife was from theEgyptian royal bloodline. Not bad for a humble shepherd who was sold intoslavery by merchants. But, of course, that’s just the Biblical cover story.Joseph was considered to be of the royal line of Hyksos pharaohs. His job, saysEllis, was to regain the throne for the Hyksos and by becoming chief aide to thepharaoh, who did not at first know his background, he was in the perfectposition to begin the process. There are many examples in history of the line of‘chief advisors’ to the royal family eventually taking over the throne. One isthe Stewards in Scotland, chief aides to the kings, who became the StuartDynasty. The Bible claims that Joseph’s brothers came back to Egypt and so, saysEllis, an underground alternative royal line lay in waiting. He says that ittook 200 years before the future pharaoh, Amenhotep III, married a daughter ofthe ‘Joseph’ Hyksos line of royal ‘stewards’ or ‘advisors’. By the way, thetitle of ‘Amen’ used in ancient Egypt, as in Amenhotep, is the origin of the“Amen” used in ‘Christian’ services because the ‘Christian’ religion is based onthe Sun worship of Egypt, Sumer and elsewhere. Ellis writes:> “Both Amenhotep II and Amenhotep III were called ‘hyk’ in their royal title –> meaning ‘Shepherd King’. More interestingly, their origins are also listed in> the record and Amenhotep II’s full title is the ‘Hyksos King of Heliopolis’;> which makes sense as this was the sacred temple and university of the Hyksos> princes. Egyptologists are strangely silent on this fact.” 32 Out of Egypt IIEllis says that a son of Amenhotep III, the “Shepherd King”, was highly likelyto have been the Biblical character called Moses, who was from the Egyptianroyal family of priest-kings and not a “poor Israelite”. “Moses”, writes Ellis,was probably Tuthmoses, brother of Amenhotep IV, the future pharaoh better knownto history as Akhenaton. The Bible story of Moses being found by the pharaoh’sdaughter floating on the Nile in a basket of bulrushes (a later steal from theKing Sargon story) was designed to hide this fact. His brother Akhenaton marriedNefertiti from the ‘vizier’ line going back to ‘Joseph’ because he knew thatthey were both from the same bloodline. The ancient royal families married theirdaughters and sisters to keep the bloodline pure and this continues today amongthe Illuminati families, although it is hidden by having children ‘out ofwedlock’ and bringing them up under other names before reuniting them later inmarriage. Incest is a fundamental part of life for the Illuminati families, asit was for the ancient bloodlines from which they originate. They are obsessedwith maintaining the genetic connection to the ‘gods’. The Hyksos pharaohAmenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaton when he sought to transform thereligion of the country to a worship of “One God” – the Sun, or perhaps moreaccurately, the “power behind the Sun”.33 Akhenaton (remarkably close toAshkenazim) was another priest-king educated at Heliopolis where the centre ofworship was the tower known as the Benben stone. This was a round tower with aconical top – the phallic symbol of the bloodline of the gods. This is the realmeaning of the obelisks all over the world, like the George Washington memorialin Washington DC, the ‘mysterious’ round towers of Ireland and the constant useof the obelisk in memorials instigated by Freemasons. In London, Paris and NewYork you will find original obelisks taken from Egypt because this is still thereligion of the Illuminati families that moved out of the Near and Middle Eastand North Africa to take control of the wider world. The Benben stone atHeliopolis stood within the Temple of the Phoenix and the phoenix or ‘Bennu’bird was in the first design of the Great Seal of United States because thebloodlines were behind the creation of the USA. Later the Phoenix was symbolisedin the seal as the eagle (which also has its own esoteric meaning) and for thisreason you will find the eagle used in national symbolism across the world –including Nazi Germany. No doubt at least some of them represent the phoenix.Akhenaton, an “Arian” or follower of the cult of Aries, says Ralph Ellis, movedthe capital of Egypt to a place called Amarna when he became pharaoh and onceagain there was a furious response from those among the priesthood and thepeople following the religion he wanted to replace. Also in the centre of thisconflict, it seems, was Akhenaton’s brother, Tuthmoses, who, like the Moses inthe Bible, gave up his royal birthright to his brother. Moses gave it to Aaronwhile Tuthmoses did the same for Akhenaton because of wounds that madeMoses/Tuthmoses less than the ‘perfect specimen’ a pharaoh had to be. Moses andTuthmoses and Aaron and Akhenaton appear to be same characters, says Ellis.Anyway, in the religious conflict under Akhenaton he and his followers (theBiblical Israelites that had not left in the first exodus) were exiled to aremote part of Egypt and segregated from the rest of the people in an area ofstone quarries. This is supported by the Biblical narrative in its story ofMoses, Aaron and the ‘Israelites’. Ellis says that Akhenaton’s father, AmenhotepIII, appeared to be a sort of joint-pharaoh operating “co-regency”, but when hedied Akhenaton took over everything. He banned all “graven images” of the oldreligion. The Great Pyramid was obviously a key part of Egyptian religion andRalph Ellis believes that this appears in the Bible under the code name of“Mount Sinai”. Moses was said to have climbed Mount Sinai to receive the MosaicLaw or Ten Commandments from ‘God’. But the Bible actually says that Moses wentinto the mountain to meet with God. Does God live in a cave then? Much morelikely that this is referring to entering a ritual chamber of the pyramid wherethe Egyptian priests went to converse with the gods. Incidentally, the TenCommandments are very similar to the Egyptian Declaration of Innocence in theJudgement of the Dead.34As unrest grew among the people, the Israelites send an army of 200,000 fromJerusalem to Avaris to support their bloodline brothers. The anti-Akhenatonpriesthood had installed his brother (often reported to be his son) Tutankhamenas the eight-year-old boy-king. He had changed his name from Tutankhaton attheir insistence. Eventually came the second and much smaller exodus asAkhenaton and Tuthmoses left to join their Egyptian brothers and sisters inCanaan. This is the exodus referred to in the Bible, but with the magnitude ofthe first one included in the tale, Ralph Ellis concludes. The Bible says thatwhen Moses died he was buried in the land called Moab – the name of the Americanweapon of mass destruction or Mother of all Bombs. Ellis says that Moab (Mera orMerab) was in fact Egypt. No wonder, as I reported earlier, that Moab isassociated with Freemasonry.‘House of David’Ellis goes on to present more compelling evidence that ‘King David’ and his son‘King Solomon’ (for whom there is no mention in the historical record outsidethe Biblical-Jewish accounts) were, in fact, another two Egyptian pharaohscalled Psusennes II (David) and Sheshonq I (Solomon). Psusennes II was the lastpharaoh of the twenty-first dynasty with his court based at Tanis in the easternDelta lands – the true location of the original Temple of Solomon, Ellissuggests. Psusennes II’s official title apparently means something like “My Starthat Appears in His City”. King David, of course, is associated with the ‘Starof David’ and ‘City of David’. Ellis contends that the Hebrew name for KingDavid was “Duad”, which is close to the Egyptian word for star, pronounceddjuat. The full title for the daughter of Psusennes II was Maatkare Mutenhat orMaatkare Mu-Tamhat while King David’s daughter is named in the Bible as MaachahTamar II.35 No archaeological record has been found of King David in the landsattributed to Israel, but references to his real self, Psusennes II, have beendiscovered.36 The suggestion is that Psusennes II of the Hyksos bloodlinearrived with an army to seize the unified monarchy of the Israelite tribes fromKing Saul and he passed this on to his son, Sheshonq I (King Solomon). Onceagain these were priest kings, the bloodline of the ‘gods’, and expert inesoteric ‘magic’ – hence the reputation of Solomon for having such powers. RalphEllis presents an extremely well researched case for this ‘Hyksos kings’scenario and the mass of inter-connecting detail can be found in his manyexcellent books. This is his comparison of the stories told about the Israelitesand the historical record of the Hyksos: > IsraelitesHyksosShepherds and kings“Shepherd Kings”Introduced religious changes into EgyptSameHad a vast armySameAdopted Egyptian names and customsSameSkilled in astronomy and scienceSameThere was a famine in EgyptSameMajor war with EgyptiansSameGreat exodus of about one million from the Nile DeltaSameFleeing Israelites pursued by pharaohSameWent to JerusalemSame 37 Hiding the truth – againThe ‘Israelite’s’ Egyptian origins were written out of the Biblical accountswhen a whole new history was invented by the ruling priesthood, the Levites.This happened most comprehensively after the invasion of the Israelite/Judeanlands by the Babylonian army of King Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BC when most – butnot all – of the former Israelite/Egyptian ‘Tribe of Judah’ were taken intocaptivity in Babylon in the former lands of Sumer. Babylon was a melting pot ofpeoples and bloodlines and a centre for what we would call Satanic ritual andblack magic. The captivity of the Israelites in Babylon did not mean prisoncells. They were not allowed to leave, but they could go about their businessand they came into contact with the religious stories and myths from Sumer andthe Sumer-Babylonian technique of controlling the people through interest onmoney. Cuneiform texts discovered in Babylon show that during the reign of KingKandalanu (648-625 BC) one banker, Jacob Egibi, was charging an interest rate of20 per cent.38 The Illuminati, who largely came out of Babylon, have beenplaying the same scam ever since. Only after the 70-year captivity did theLevite priesthood produce the texts that became the Torah (the law), the firstfive books of the Old Testament also known as the Pentateuch that are officiallyattributed to “Moses”. This was hundreds of years after the events were supposedto have taken place. These texts created new ‘Israelite’ names for formerEgyptian pharaohs and made up stories to provide an official history that suitedtheir interests. The invented name of Solomon includes in every syllable a wordmeaning the Sun – Sol-Om-On. Solomon means Sun-Sun-Sun. Hot stuff. Whenever theywanted the people to do something they wrote that ‘God’ had commanded it. Theyused the basket on the river story of King Sargon in Mesopotamia to cover thetruth about the man they dubbed “Moses” and introduced the character of “StMichael”, the Sumerian Tas Mi-ki-gal, the dragon slayer and Lord ofAgriculture.39 He was later called the Lord of the Air and given wings to fly.There were no ‘angels’ in Israelite belief until the Babylon captivity.40 TheBabylonian holy days were turned into the ‘Jewish’ holy days, including thePassover and Feast of the Tabernacles.41 The Levites relocated the Sumerian andEgyptian stories and themes to lands that they called Israel. The high initiatesthrough the centuries have understood the coded story, but the mass of thepeople who have called themselves Jewish have been sold a lie, a cover story, toimprison their minds and make them slaves to their hierarchy. Even circumcision,so fundamentally associated with the Jewish faith, came from … Egypt. Of courseit did.What really is Zionism?The sacred place of the Jewish faith is Zion, hence Zionism. It is variouslyclaimed to be Jerusalem and apparently Mount Sinai – Mount Zion – which RalphEllis says in his books is code for the Great Pyramid at Giza. But Ellis writes:> “… the nation that built … [Jerusalem] … was primarily influenced by three> pyramids at Giza, which were now regarded as the three symbolic foundations of> the Judaic people and their religion. When, according to the famous song, the> Israelites sat down in Babylon and remembered Zion, they were not just> reminiscing about their lost City of David; they were also remembering the> long-lost days when they could physically visit their primary temple in Egypt> – the Great Pyramid at Giza.” 42 Ellis says that when the scribes reminisced about Giza, they symbolised Zion asa mountain or a desert monument (“Tsion” in Hebrew) and when they weresymbolising Zion as Jerusalem it was described as a castle. But even with thelatter, Egypt is centre stage once again. Ellis makes the following comparisonbetween the Judean Zion of Jerusalem and the Egyptian city of Tchian or Zian(known today as Tanis) where the walls were stamped with the cartouche or codeof the pharaoh, Psusennes II (King David): > Judean ZionEgyptian ZianCalled JebusCalled Jebet (Tchebet)Known as a castleKnown as a fortressIdentified with a rockKnown as the “Rock”Called the City of King DavidCalled the City of King Psusennes II 43 Zionism is not about fulfilling the Biblical text as read by the masses. It isdedicated to the global dictatorship of the Egyptian – Sumerian royal dynastiesseeded by the ‘gods’. They have recaptured Sumer and Babylon (Iraq), so doesthis mean “Look out Egypt”? Alongside the bloodlines is the religion of the SunGod. Ralph Ellis writes that the Hebrew word Eli has the root meaning of“ascension” or to “climb up” – the rising Sun.44 So we have the name,Isra-eli-tes. The name Eli is also used as El. The chief Sun god of Egypt was Raand the Moon goddess was Isis. Thus we have Israel … Is-ra-el. It is theIlluminati Trinity again that constantly recurs. I have highlighted in otherbooks how the Judaic hero, Samson, was a symbol for the Sun and we can see it inhis name. In Hebrew, Samson (Shimshown) means “a representation of the Sun”.45The worship of the Moon is also implied in the name of the Hebrew god, YHWH orYahweh. Ralph Ellis writes:> “Could the ineffable, the unspeakable, name of the Israelite god be etched> into the walls of the great Temple of Karnak perhaps? It may seem incredible,> but I think that this is precisely the case. The first two letters of the> tetragrammaton are YH and the presumed vowel in the middle is an ‘a’, giving> the syllable of ‘yah’. Turning to the Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary of> Wallis Budge, it can be seen that the name Yah can be translated as ‘the> Moon’. Here, at last, is confirmation that the presumptions I have made are> standing on secure foundations. If the word Yahweh was derived from Egypt, it> is highly likely to have had some lunar connotation.” 46 The Rothschild “kings”I have also stressed the key role in the conspiracy of the Rothschild family andit is no surprise that their name Rothschild or “Red Shield” can be traced backto Egypt and the Hyksos kings. Ellis reports that the Hyksos/Israelites woreprotective talismans in the form of a ‘star shield’ that became the ‘Star ofDavid’. This is today displayed on the flag of theRothschild-created-and-controlled State of Is-ra-el (Figure 21). What’s more,the Hyksos kings were closely associated with the colour red. The crown of theHyksos pharaohs in Lower Egypt was the Red Crown, known as the djesher-t(djesher in Egyptian meant red and the first-born sons of Israel were sometimesidentified by a scarlet thread on their wrist).47 The Rothschilds or Redshieldscould well be of the Hyksos royal line from Egypt/Sumer, as are many otherIlluminati families. These are the families who have retained the DNA connectionto the ‘gods’ and this is why they don’t give a damn about the plight of themass of Jewish people in general who are not of this ‘royal’ line. Do mostBritish monarchs give a damn about the ‘common people’ over whom they ‘reign’?Exactly.Image [../Images/00026.jpg]Figure 21: The Star of David or Psusennes II – the Roth (Red) Shield. It is nowon the flag of the Rothschild-created and controlled State of Is-Ra-El Out of Babylon came the coded cover story produced by the Levites that we knowas the Old Testament and the books of the Torah or Pentateuch that are the basisof Judaism. The Levites were the priestly tribe of ‘Moses’ and ‘Aaron’ orAkhenaton and I wonder if the Levites were really the bloodline going back tothe priests at Heliopolis? What also emerged from Babylon was the trulyappalling, unspeakable, Babylonian Talmud on which the more extreme forms of thebelief system are founded. This takes precedence over the Jerusalem Talmud. TheJewish religion that has held the minds of its believers in thousands of yearsof servitude came from these perversions of the truth inspired in Babylon. Itwas this manufactured version of ‘God’ and history into which the Khazars wereconverted about 740 AD, but their elite would have known the real score. Thereis no way in the world that the Roman royal bloodline of Byzantium would havebred with a Khazar princess to produce Emperor Leo the Khazar, for example,unless the lady was from the ‘bloodline of the gods’. Indeed, especially as shewas female, the route through which the crucial DNA is preserved across thegenerations. The Egyptian-Sumerian royal bloodlines expanded throughout theworld and this is why evidence has been discovered, as I outlined in The BiggestSecret and Children of the Matrix, that Egyptians and their associated Sumeriansand Phoenicians settled in Britain and Ireland thousands of years before theChristian era. It was they who built the great monoliths and stone circles likeStonehenge and Avebury. These bloodlines also expanded through the CaucasusMountains and into the lands of the later Khazars.Same origins, different spinIslam is also based on the stories of people like Abraham – the first Hyksospharaoh according to Ralph Ellis. He points out that the name of Allah, theIslamic God, is derived from the Hebrew Eli (the spelling in Hebrew is almostidentical) which means ascension and “to rise up” – the rising Sun. In turn, wehave Heli, the Greek word for Sun, and all go back to Egypt where, for example,the Sun God Aton is almost certainly the origin of another Hebrew name for God,Adhon (plural Adhonai). Christianity, too, came out of Babylon in its structuralform and the world’s three major religions all originated from the fabricatedallegorical stories of the “royal bloodline” of Egypt and its closely associatedbloodlines of Sumer from where Noah is said to have resided and produced hisoffspring of the gods. Noah is another code for the bloodline (see Children ofthe Matrix). To think that these three religions, based on the samemisrepresentations, have been fighting each other all these years! It is thesame with the Hindus and Muslims. It is the common origins of Judaism andChristianity that has led to both Jews and the Pope wearing a skullcap. Itsymbolises the way the priests in the Mystery schools of Egypt and elsewherewould shave their heads in that same place. Christian monks and such like havedone the same. The Pope also holds a shepherd’s crook, a symbol in Egypt of theShepherd Kings, and even the title of Pope could well originate from theEgyptian Hyksos king, Apopis II.48 This can also be pronounced “Apapi” and theoriginal 6th dynasty version of his name was Papi or Popi.49 This could be theroot of Papa, Pop and Pope, all versions of “father”.Christianity may appear to have moved from the ‘Holy Land’ to Rome, but theRoman Church that turned Christianity into the state religion was simply the‘Church’ of Babylon transplanted when the Illuminati moved their headquartersfrom Babylon to Rome. That is why the Christian religion, and its churches, areawash with ancient ‘Pagan’ symbolism (see The Biggest Secret). The Babyloniantrinity of Nimrod (the fish), his ‘son’, Tammuz (who ‘died to save the sins ofhumanity’) and his ‘mother’, Queen Semiramis (the dove), were transformed intoChristianity’s ‘Father, Son and Holy Ghost’. That may seem to have ousted thefemale or goddess from the trinity, but Roman Catholicism venerates Mary, thevirgin ‘Mother of Jesus’, in the same way that the Egyptians did with Isis, thevirgin ‘Mother of Horus’, and the Babylonians did with Semiramis, the virgin‘Mother of Tammuz’. Semiramis, Isis and Mary are all names for the same deity.The ‘virgin’ bit is related to the bloodlines seeded by the gods. QueenSemiramis was said to have had an ‘immaculate conception’ when she wasimpregnated by ‘God’ – the rays of the Sun God Baal/Nimrod. If you look atFigures 22 and 23, you will see the glaringly obvious comparison between theEgyptian portrayal of Isis and Horus and the Christian one of Mary and Jesus.Horus and Jesus were, like Nimrod, both connected to the symbol of the fish. TheGospel stories on which Christianity is founded are a mass ofSumerian/Babylonian/ Egyptian Mystery school symbolism relating to Sun worship,secret rituals and other esoteric concepts, as I detail in The Biggest Secret.The same basic story of ‘born on December 25th, died to save humanity, etc.,etc.’, was widely told thousands of years before Christianity about the exploitsof the Sun gods in many and various cultures, including Rome (Mithra) andBabylon (Tammuz – the ‘Son of the Sun God’). Tammuz and Nimrod are symbolised inendless forms around the ancient and modern world and this includes ‘Jesus’.This is why ‘Christian’ churches always orientate to the east – the direction ofthe rising Sun. Nimrod was worshipped (and still is) as ‘The House of the RisingSun’. This is precisely what ‘Christian’ churches are and thus they are oftentargeted for Satanic rituals. What better place could the Satanists have? Thechurches are full of Babylonian symbolism venerating Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz andsurrounded by dead bodies in the churchyard.Image [../Images/00027.jpg]Image [../Images/00028.jpg]Figures 22 and 23: On the left is how the ancient Egyptians portrayed their‘Virgin Mother’ Isis, and her saviour son, Horus. On the right is the classicpose of the Christian Virgin Mother, Mary, and her saviour son, Jesus, in achurch at Godshill on the Isle of Wight in England. They are the same deitiesunder different names. Horus and Jesus were also both connected to the symbol ofthe fish, as was Nimrod in Babylon The halos used in pictures of the Gospel heroes are inspired by the way theancients portrayed their Sun gods with halos to symbolise what they represented.Jesus is called ‘the Light of the World’ because he is another name for the Sun,and he is symbolised as a fish because that was the symbol of Nimrod in Babylon.When Nimrod was killed it was said that his body was cut into pieces and hiswife/mother, Queen Semiramis, found all the pieces except his penis. Exactly thesame story was told about Osiris and Isis in Egypt. Nimrod was said to have‘ascended’ to the Sun and become the Sun God ‘Baal’ – a major Illuminati deityto this day. As the Sun rose in the morning, the Babylonians believed it wasNimrod/Baal ‘rising again’. At Sunset, they said, he went to fight off evilcreatures in the ocean, only to return again every morning – victorious! QueenSemiramis said that it was Nimrod, as the rays of the Sun, who impregnated herto conceive Tammuz. It was claimed that Tammuz (or Damu and Dammuzi as he isalso known) was the reincarnation of Nimrod and it was said, therefore, that the“Father and son are one”. This is the origin of the same claim by ‘Christianity’that the Father God and his son, ‘Jesus’ (Nimrod/Tammuz), are one. The Gospelstories are actually symbolic tales about Nimrod/Tammuz using the names ‘God’and ‘Jesus’ with ‘Mother Mary’ and ‘Mary Magdalene’ added to represent differentexpressions of Queen Semiramis. Mother Mary is known as the ‘Queen of Heaven’ –exactly the title given to Semiramis in Babylon. Mary Magdalene is portrayed asa prostitute or whore in the Bible – Queen Semiramis is the ‘Whore of Babylon’.Christianity is the Sun religion of Babylon and when Illuminati operatives likeBush, Blair and the British royal family claim to be ‘Christians’ and attend‘Christian’ services, they are, in fact, knowingly worshipping Nimrod/Tammuz/Semiramis, the Babylonian trinity. When others talk about the ‘bloodline ofJesus’ surviving to become the Merovingian kings, this is really code for thebloodline of Nimrod, Tammuz and Semiramis: the bloodline of Babylon/Sumer. The‘Jesus bloodline’ story promoted by people like the British author, Sir LaurenceGardner, claims that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and produced children thatcontinued the bloodline that became Merovingian [Illuminati] royalty. This issimply code representing the bloodline of Nimrod (Jesus) and Queen Semiramis(Mary Magdalene) – the hybrid ‘royal’ line of Sumer.Queen Semiramis proclaimed that Nimrod/Baal would be present on Earth after hisdeath in the form of a flame and that’s the real origin of the Illuminati symbolof the flame or lighted torch. This is what the Statue of Liberty is holding andshe is a mirror of the way the Babylonians portrayed Queen Semiramis! WhenTammuz died, Semiramis said that he had “ascended to his father” and would alsobe worshipped as a flame. The ‘Christian’ festival of Easter comes from the samesource. Easter comes from the Babylonian goddess, Ishtar, (Semiramis again) andit celebrated her son, Tammuz, who was, wait for it, the “only begotten son ofthe Moon goddess and Sun God” – Nimrod and Semiramis. The “Easter” (Ishtar) eggsand the “Easter bunny” also come from Babylon. Queen Semiramis said she camefrom the Moon in a giant egg and this became known as the Ishtar egg. Tammuz wassaid to be very fond of rabbits and so we have the Easter bunny. Oh yes, andthey also ate “sacred cakes” with a T on the top – the origin of our hot crossbuns. The T is a major symbol of Freemasonry, partly because of its associationswith Babylon and Tammuz. The Christian wafer used in Catholic ceremonies comesfrom the Egyptian ta-en-aah – the sacrificial bread of the Moon.50 Christiansthink the bread symbolises the ‘body of Jesus’ when they are really involved ina ritual about the Egyptian Moon god. It doesn’t take much brain power to seethe true meaning behind drinking red wine as the ‘blood of Jesus’. Mine’s a typeA, please barman. Other representations of Semiramis, by the way, include Athena(Greece), Minerva (Egypt and Greece), Astarte (Syria), Cybele (Rome), Ashtoreth(Israel) and Diana (Ephesus). Diana, the great goddess of the Merovingians, issymbolised as the Goddess of the Moon, child birth and hunting. Diana isSemiramis, the ‘goddess who came from the Moon’, who gave birth to Tammuz andwas married to Nimrod, the ‘hunter’. Semiramis is everywhere under differentnames and Princess Diana’s murder in Paris in 1997 was a symbolic ritualsacrifice to Semiramis (see The Biggest Secret). In Illuminati symbolism, PrinceCharles (Sun God/Nimrod) impregnated Princess Diana (Queen Semiramis) to producePrince William (Tammuz), the ‘Son of the Sun God’ who was induced to be bornwhen? On June 21st – the summer solstice, the major day of worship to the Sun.Ralph Ellis believes that behind all this symbolism and make-believe there was aman on whom ‘Jesus’ was based (although very different to the Gospel herodepicted by Christianity). He says that the claim that ‘Jesus’ was of the Houseof David was an indication that he was claiming to be of the Egyptian Hyksosbloodline (pharaohs were called the “Son of God”- bloodline of the gods). I haveheard the ‘Jesus’ bloodline story proposed many times by various authors,especially Sir Laurence Gardner, but I simply don’t buy it. Jesus is code forNimrod/Baal/Tammuz and Mary Magdalene is code for Queen Semiramis. What betterway to justify global domination by the bloodline families to billions ofChristians than to make out it is the sacred bloodline of their Christ? Analternative view to the ‘bloodline of Jesus’ story and its associated secretsociety, the Priory of Sion, can be found athttp://www.alpheus.org/html/articles/esoteric_history/richardson1.html[http://www.alpheus.org/html/articles/esoteric_history/richardson1.html].I would add this point also. I read stories about the bloodline, including theMerovingians, “almost dying out” and that Jesus was the last of the line who hadto pass on his bloodline to keep it alive and so on. Nonsense, I would say.These ancient ‘royal’ lines in their various forms are all over the world and, Istress again, they are passed on through the female line that history largelydoes not record. History follows the men. Large numbers of bloodline births arealso outside marriage and the real parentage is not recorded. The bloodlinedepended on one man? Are you kidding?And the freemasons too …When famous Illuminati names go to church – be it Christian or ‘Jewish’ – theyknow what the symbolism and the texts really mean. They know they are takingpart in an ancient pre-Christian or pre-Jewish ritual celebrating theirbloodline and origins.Image [../Images/00029.jpg]Figure 24: The origins of Freemasonry confirmed in a picture on the wall of theFreemason headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. This secret society goes backto the ancient world and even beyond Sumer and Egypt to Atlantis and Mu orLemuria These religious rituals are the ‘outer’ knowledge presented in code while the‘inner’ knowledge is passed down through the highest levels of the secretsociety network, which is based, once again, on the same bloodline andEgypt-Sumer-Babylon origins as the major religions. Freemasonry is usuallytraced to the 1600s when the guilds of masons who built the cathedrals (usingthe sacred geometry of the ancient pyramid builders and coded architecture)began to allow outsiders to join. The Mother Lodge of Freemasonry was formed inLondon on June 24th 1717. But informed Freemasons know that is not their trueorigin. My wife Pam and I walked into the Freemason headquarters in Boston,Massachusetts, and when we found no one around we decided to keep walking untilwe were stopped. We saw only a builder who thought we were supposed to be thereand took a number of pictures inside as we walked down the corridors and intothe temples. You can see from Figure 24, a picture in one of the corridors, thatthey trace their origins to ancient Egypt and the Middle East. The captionunderneath the picture spoke of Freemasonry passing from “Friend to Friend, fromcenturies past to centuries to come”. It features George Washington, the firstPresident of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, who was so important in thecountry’s creation, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the wartime leader,President Harry S. Truman, who ordered the nuclear strikes on Japan, GeneralDouglas Macarthur of Korean War fame and astronaut Buzz Aldrin.The Freemasons worship the ‘Great Architect’ in their rituals and in Egypt thepharaoh was called the ‘Greatest of Architects’ or the ‘Son of God’. This is whyyou find the symbols of Freemasonry dominated by the tools of the builder orarchitect, like the compass and hammer. The hammers banged on a block by judgesin their courts are also Freemasonic symbols relating to the ‘Great Architect’and Egypt. The Illuminati created and control the ‘justice’ system, as I havelong highlighted. Freemasonry or ‘The Craft’ is focussed on the building andre-building of King Solomon’s Temple that was located, it claims, in Jerusalemon the site of the present El-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Mount. King Solomon =Egyptian King Sheshonq I, says Ralph Ellis. The Freemasonic hero is called HiramAbif (the “widow’s son”), who is claimed to be the chief architect of Solomon’sTemple and the man the Bible refers to as Hiram. But once again Ralph Ellismakes the Egyptian connection. The chief designer for Sheshonq I’s temples inEgypt was called Harem Atif (“Hiram is my father”), he says.51 Harem or Hiramwas a royal/priestly title in Egypt and used by some pharaohs, as with Haremheb.Temple Mount to the Arabs is Harem a-Sharif. The Egyptian and Freemasonicgoddess known as Ma’at was depicted as a symbol of truth and justice and youwill find her on many court buildings with her arms out stretched holding asword and scales. The title of magistrate is derived from Ma’at, who assistedOsiris in the judgment of the dead by weighing their hearts.52 As the Egyptianknowledge and bloodline passed through history, Ma’at became known to the Greeksas Themis and her ability to foresee the future allowed her to become one of theoracles at Delphi and the “goddess of divine justice”.53 The Roman goddess ofjustice was called Justitia and she was often portrayed as balancing both scalesand a sword while wearing a blindfold.One of the major secret societies that carried the knowledge from Egypt andSumer at the time of the Roman Empire was the Comacine Masters, the Romanexpression of the Mystery school known as the Dionysian Artificers. They usedthe same symbols that we see in ‘modern’ Freemasonry, including the black andwhite squares on the floor of their temples. Appropriately, you see this in manychurches and the great cathedrals of Europe. The cathedrals were built to thesacred geometry of Egypt and Sumer by the Knights Templar and their associatedsecret societies and groups. See The Biggest Secret for a vast amount ofinformation about such matters and the symbolism of the Illuminati. I havestressed that the agenda is to create a global fascist state and we can find thesymbol for that in Egypt and the Freemasons. The word for axe in Egypt wasneter, which is very close to neter-kherti, a term that means quarryman orstonemason.54 This is highly likely to be the real meaning of the axe in thesymbol of the fasces (an axe and bundled rods) – the origin of the word fascism.The axe was also associated with the goddess, the key figure in Illuminatiritual. Ma’at was sometimes portrayed holding the fasces in one hand and a flame(the main Illuminati symbol) in the other. The 22nd degree of the Scottish Riteis called a Prince of Libanus or Knight of the Royal Axe. The following is aFreemasonic explanation of this degree and note the mention of the Hyksos:> “This degree teaches that all labor is honorable, and the ‘toiling millions’> should be respected and assisted [sure]. The Phoenicians [of Egypt/Sumer> origin], especially those of the city of Tsidun, are remembered as those who> cut cedars on Mount Libanus (Lebanon) for Noah’s ark, as well as the Ark of> the Covenant and the Temples of Jerusalem. The peoples of Phoenicia, Hiram of> Tyre and Hiram Abif included, were tied to the Israelites by the fact that> they shared the mysteries, and it is even said that the Etrurian and Roman> Colleges of Artificers descended from them via the Hyksos. The Lodge, styled a> College, has two apartments. The first is a plain room which represents a> workshop on Mount Libanus. Here, the Senior Warden, or ‘Master Carpenter,’> presides. The second apartment is hung in red, lighted by 36 lights, and is> called the Council-room of the Round Table. The brethren sit at a round wooden> table, and the altar in the East holds the three great lights and an axe.> Battery: [2-2-2]. The apron is white, bordered in purple, and contains a> three-headed serpent and a table with instruments and plans on it. The jewel> is an axe and handle of gold. On the top of the handle are the initials of> Noah [from the land that became Sumer] and Solomon [from Egypt]. In the middle> of the handle are the initials of Libanus and Tsidun. On the blade are the> initials of Adoniram, Cyrus, Darius, Zerubbabel, Nehemiah, Ezra (on one side),> and Shem, Kham, Yapheth, Moses, Ahaliab, Betselal (on the other).” 55 Freemasons and their connected secret societies (operating under overallIlluminati leadership) have their agents in control of all areas of globalsociety, including politics, business, banking, media, medicine and military.Freemasons controlled both sides in the American War of Independence when theMother Lodge in London made sure the ‘right’ side won to give the illusion thatthe new United States was no longer controlled from England (see The BiggestSecret). Of the 55 signatories of the American Declaration of Independence, atleast 50 were known to be Freemasons and only one known not to be. The GreatSeal of the United States is a mass of ancient Egyptian symbolism with the GreatPyramid and All-Seeing Eye, the eagle (or phoenix), the repetition of theesoterically-sacred number 13 and the motto “Novus Ordo Seclorum”, which isLatin for “New Order of the Ages”. One of the Illuminati code names for theiragenda is “New World Order” or “New Order of the Ages”. The Pyramid andAll-Seeing Eye was put on the dollar bill by President Franklin Delano‘Illuminati’ Roosevelt and his later Vice-President, Henry Wallace, who believedthat America was chosen by God (the gods) to lead the world in establishing theNew World Order. Wallace was a prominent Freemason and he wrote in 1934:> “It will take a more definite recognition of the Grand Architect of the> Universe before the apex stone [capstone of the pyramid] is finally fitted> into place and this nation in the full strength of its power is in position to> assume leadership among the nations in inaugurating ‘the New Order of the> Ages’.” 56 Wallace knew that the United States was always planned to be the vehicle for thefinal push to global dictatorship – exactly what is happening now.The British pharoahsThe Cornonation of the British monarch is inspired by the crowning ceremoniesfor the pharaohs of Egypt passed down through the Old Testament in “Israelite”form. In 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in Westminster Abbey, theArchbishop of Canterbury turned to the north, south, east and west (the fourpoints of the Pagan cross) and the congregation shouted “God save the Queen”.This was symbolic of the story in the Old Testament described the crowning ofSaul as King of Israel when people shouted “God save the King”. This cry can befound eight times in the Old Testament when the kings of Israel are crowned. TheQueen sat in the Coronation Chair, under which was the ancient “Scone Stone”that legend says was brought from Egypt/Israel. In her hands were the Egyptiansymbols, a sceptre and a rod. On the top of the sceptre was a Maltese Cross(symbol of the Illuminati Knights of Malta) and on the rod was a dove (thesymbol of Babylon’s Queen Semiramis). She later held an orb with the MalteseCross on the top, the same as those used by the Dutch (and high-Illuminati)House of Orange. The Queen was anointed with oil, the ancient tradition thatgoes back thousands of the years to the Egypt-Sumer era and beyond. The wordChrist means “Anointed One”. The oil used in the British Coronation is the samemixture as that used in Egypt and Israel. It is carried in a gold vessel calledan ampoule made in the form of an eagle (phoenix) and legends also connect thispart of the ceremony to the dove (Queen Semiramis). The oil is symbolic of the“messeh” fat of the crocodile used in the coronation ceremonies for the pharaohsin ancient Egypt. From this we get “messiah” – the Jewish legend of the coming“messiah” – the one anointed with the fat of the crocodile: the new pharaoh. Theanointing at the Coronation is supposed to elevate the monarch to the rank ofHigh Priest and in this case, appropriately, High Priestess of the Church ofEngland, as well as head of state. While this was happening, the Archbishop ofCanterbury said:> “As king, priests and prophets were anointed: and as Solomon was anointed by> Zadock the priest, Nathan the prophet, so be thou anointed, blessed and> consecrated Queen over the people whom the Lord thy God has given thee to rule> and govern …” The Coronation Crown is set with 12 jewels together with two depictions of theMaltese Cross, one of the most prominent symbols of the Nazis. In theLevite-authored Exodus we hear of the Breastplate of Aaron, which is set with 12stones. The same stones, in the same order, appear on the British crown. And whodoes Ralph Ellis say Aaron was? Akhenaton!! The Archbishop placed his handbetween those of the Queen to pay homage to the new head of his Church and hekissed her right hand. Then he said:> “The Lord Almighty … establish your throne in righteousness, that it may stand> for evermore, like as the Sun before him, and as a faithful witness in> heaven.” This is almost a repeat of the words used in “God’s covenant” with David in theOld Testament. The “Lord Almighty” was called El-Shaddai and we are talkingNimrod/Baal from Babylon. The Cornonation is completed with the “CoronationAnthem” called Zadock the Priest, the man who is said to have performed thecoronation ceremony of King Solomon (Sheshonq I). Wherever you look you find theancient ‘royal’ bloodlines, their rituals and agenda, and their goal is globaldomination as I have been warning all these years.Rep-talesOK, so it is clear that the interbreeding “bloodlines of the gods” who ruled theancient world continue to rule today. But who are these bloodlines and who arethe ‘gods’ that seeded them? The Sumerian Tablets reveal that the Anunnaki werea reptilian race, as widely confirmed when you read other ancient accounts. ASumerian Tablet dating to around 3500 BC leaves us in no doubt as it describesthe arrival of the Anunnaki: “The reptiles verily descend.” 57 In Hebrew myth,the Biblical “Nefilim”, the “sons of the gods”, are called awwim, which meansdevastators or serpents. The symbol of the Hyksos kings was the snake andEgyptian royalty were very much associated with reptilian imagery. Evenacademics like Dr Arthur David Horn, former Professor of Biological Anthropologyat Colorado State University at Fort Collins, have concluded that humanity wasseeded by an extraterrestrial race and that the Anunnaki were reptilian. He,too, believes that these same Reptilians have controlled the world for thousandsof years, as he explains in his book, Humanity’s Extraterrestrial Origins.58 TheIlluminati use reptilian and Anunnaki symbolism all the time, as you can see inThe Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix, and remember how Jay Garner andZalmay Khalilzad hosted a meeting of Iraqi groups in the shadow of the4,000-year-old ziggurat at Ur, the stepped-pyramid temple of the ancientSumerians? Ur was a major centre for the Anunnaki and the ziggurat is believedby some to be a place where communication and interbreeding took place withhumans. What a coincidence that the Illuminati-controlled American governmentshould choose such a location for their first conference after Iraq wasoccupied.The themes of the Sumerian Tablets are supported by Credo Mutwa, one of only twosurviving ‘Sanusi’ left in southern Africa. A Sanusi is the peak of the Africanshamanistic stream. Credo is in his eighties and the other Sanusi, his aunt, isin her nineties. He is the official historian and storyteller of the Zulu nationand the very name “Zulu” means “People from the Stars” because they believe theywere seeded by an extraterrestrial ‘royal’ race. I think many extraterrestrialgroups have been involved in seeding human races for aeons and this has given usthe diversity of forms. With no one for him to pass on his knowledge, and theurgent need for everyone to know the astonishing information he has received ina lifetime of initiations, I produced videos with him called The ReptilianAgenda. They run more than six hours and still that is only a fraction of theknowledge he holds. In the videos he reveals what he once pledged in hisinitiations never to reveal, but he says the situation for humanity is soperilous that it is far more important for them to know what is going on thanfor him to keep such vows of silence. This information went underground when theEuropeans invaded Africa and their Illuminati leaders, in Credo’s words, “milkedthe minds of the shamans and then killed them”. It was suicide to talk openly ofsuch things and secret networks of initiation were formed to keep it alive.Image [../Images/00030.jpg]Figure 25: The Necklace of the Mysteries in the possession of Credo Mutwa thatappears in accounts going back 500 years and Credo believes is at least 1,000years old Image [../Images/00031.jpg]Figure 26: The necklace features a non-human figure with a “come-and-get-me”penis that fits into the earth woman. This symbolises the interbreeding of theChitauri/Anunnaki that created the hybrid bloodline Image [../Images/00032.jpg]Figure 27: Another symbol hanging from the necklace is a ‘flying saucer’ thatthe accounts say were used by the Chitauri/Anunnaki Credo, who has become a great friend, tells the same story of the interbreedingbetween the extraterrestrial Anunnaki and humans to produce a hybrid race. Hehas artefacts like the “Necklace of the Mysteries”, which confirm this story(Figures 25, 26 and 27). It is an extremely heavy copper ‘necklace’ thatactually rests on the shoulders and it has been mentioned in records 500 yearsold. Credo says it goes back at least 1,000 years. The large symbols that hangfrom the necklace tell the story of humanity. In pride of place at the front arean extraterrestrial with a big copper willy and an Earth woman into whom the ET‘fits’, if you follow me. This is symbolic, Credo explains, of the union betweenthe people from the stars and the people of the planet. You find the same themerecorded in virtually every ancient culture. Significantly, he says the copperwilly was once made of gold before it was stolen and replaced with copper. Thismirrors the ancient Egyptian story about the golden penis of their key god,Osiris, which is symbolised by the secret societies today, especially theFreemasons, as an obelisk. The way the extraterrestrial is portrayed on thenecklace, Credo says, is merely symbolic because these ‘gods’ were of a verydistinct and unhuman form (reptilian) and they warned the people of instantdeath if they ever depicted them as they really looked. How often we can observein religious texts the theme of “God (the gods) must not be seen or revealed”.Thus the ‘gods’ were portrayed symbolically. Hanging from the Necklace of theMysteries is a large hand, full of symbols. Among these is the all-seeing eye,which symbolises, Credo says, the “Watchers” (the same as the Illuminati imageon the US dollar bill); there is also the constellation of Orion, which modernresearchers have constantly connected with extraterrestrial activity on Earth;and there is a Star of David, so associated with “King David” (Psusennes II) andnow on the flag of Is-ra-el. As some Jewish historians have stated, it is anancient symbol found all over the world and only became closely associated withthe Jewish faith when the banking and Illuminati bloodline dynasty, theRothschilds or Redshields, began to use it in the eighteenth century. TheNecklace of the Mysteries includes a very clear ‘flying saucer’ which, thelegend says, the extraterrestrials flew from their giant ‘Mothership’ to land onthe Earth. They say the Mothership continued to orbit and it was to there thatthe leaders sheltered during the upheavals of the Great Flood. This is exactlywhat the Sumerian Tablets say. In France, cave paintings dated to between 10,000and 30,000 years ago include oval and disc-shaped objects standing on tripodlegs with ladders coming down from them. A drawing carved in a cliff at Ferganiain Central Asia had a man who appeared to be wearing an “airtight helmet” withsome mechanical device on his back. It was dated to 7000 BC. Whatever the originand nature of ‘flying saucers’ and other such craft, they have been seen andrecorded for thousands of years.Image [../Images/00033.jpg]Figure 28: Credo Mutwa’s painting of a Chitauri reptilian from ancient andmodern accounts. This represents one of the warrior class and not the ‘royal’leadership Reptilian royaltyCredo has painted pictures from ancient and modern descriptions of thesereptilian entities (Figure 28) and describes the various levels of the fiercelyimposed genetic hierarchy. The lower levels are the ‘warriors’, the ‘poor bloodyinfantry’, as we say in Britain. There is another Reptilian as typicallydescribed in Figure 29 (overleaf). How appropriate that British troops weregiven reptile training glasses during their preparations for desert warfare inIraq in 2003 (Figure 30, overleaf). The Reptilians are ruled by the ‘royal’leaders, which have horns and tails, Credo says, and at the very top are beingswith a white, albino-like skin and not the greenish or brownish colour of theothers. Witnesses and abductees have reported seeing reptilian beings withalbino-like skin and these descriptions can also be found in ancient texts. InCredo’s Africa these Reptilians are known as the Chitauri, which translates as“Children of the Serpent” or “Children of the Python”. This is so close to theCentral American term, “People of the Serpent”. Africa, like every othercontinent, is awash with the legend of the serpent race. Credo Mutwa talks forhours on the DVDs, The Reptilian Agenda, about the background and history of theChitauri. He describes how the Earth was once encircled by a canopy of watervapour (the “firmament”) that was destroyed in a cataclysm. This water vapourprotected the planet from the harsh effects of the Sun, and the whole planet wasmoist and humid and had a constant temperature. It was a place of enormousabundance and vast forests. This is a common description of the pre-cataclysmic‘Golden Age’ or the Lemurian/ Muan ‘Garden of Eden’ in the Pacific Ocean. But,he says, when the Chitauri destroyed this canopy (symbolised by the Biblical 40days and 40 nights of rain) the whole climate changed as the Sun’s rays bakedonce green and abundant lands, like Egypt, and began to form the deserts.Scientists agree that Egypt, now part of the Sahara Desert, was once a green andpleasant land. This was in the days when Egypt was ‘Khemit’. The story couldexplain the water erosion found on the Sphinx (which has a face of a woman, nota man). To divide and rule the people, Credo continues, the Chitauri scatteredthem across the Earth and gave them different languages so they could notcommunicate with each other. This is another story repeated all over the worldand not just in the Old Testament version of the Tower of Babel. That was takenfrom many more ancient accounts. The Native American Hopi tribe in Arizona saythat when they came to the surface of the Earth on the orders of “Spider Woman”,a “mocking bird” arrived to confuse their language and make the tribes talk indifferent tongues. Credo, repeating the information passed on to him in alifetime of initiations into this underground knowledge, said the ChitauriReptilians interbred with all races to create the reptilian-mammalian hybridsthrough which they rule. He said that in African culture a person’s genealogy isvery important and that the ‘royal’ bloodlines of the kings of black Africaclaimed descent from the same ‘gods’ as the white ‘royalty’ across the world. Hesaid that these black royal bloodlines (like those in the countries of the‘West’) had largely moved out of the positions of inherited control, the kingsand queens, where they could be identified. Instead they have taken thepositions of ‘appointed’ or ‘elected’ control, like government administrators,bankers, businessmen and political leaders. He reveals, from his knowledge ofblack African genealogy, that many black presidents who came to power after‘independence’ from the white Europeans have been the same royal bloodlines asthe kings and queens of black Africa. He cited Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe as anexample – the same Robert Mugabe who was manipulated into power by theIlluminati’s Henry Kissinger and British Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, asexplained in And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Mugabe has brought poverty,hunger and chaos to black and white alike in a country that should be one of therichest in Africa. At the same time he has made himself a billionaire by‘winning’ rigged elections and stealing the people’s wealth. This is typical ofthe bloodline’s behaviour.Image [../Images/00034.jpg]Figure 29: A painting by artist Hilary Reed of a Reptilian entity as describedby witnesses Image [../Images/00035.jpg]Figure 30: A British soldier wearing the eye protectors issued to the troops asthey prepared for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. How appropriate Recurring storyIn the late nineteenth century, Colonel James Churchward, an ardent researcherinto the existence of Mu or Lemuria, says he was shown some ancient tablets inthe secret vault of a monastery in northern India. They told the story of howthe Naacals or Naga Mayas (“serpents”) from the continent of Lemuria-Mu hadtravelled to India via Burma to establish a colony there. Churchward put thetexts together in years of painstaking work and revealed how they described thedestruction of Mu, the Motherland, and how the Naga Mayas or Nagas had travelledto India.59 The Vedic scholar David Frawley explains how the ancient Hindu holybooks, the Vedas, reveal that the earliest royal bloodlines of India, thepriest-kings, descend from the Bhrigus who arrived from a place across the sea.The Bhrigus were an order of adepts initiated into the ancient knowledge.Frawley says in his book, Gods, Sages, And Kings: Vedic Secrets Of AncientCivilization,60 that the monarchs of these bloodlines included the “SerpentKing” Nahusha. They expanded into the five tribes that populated a large part ofthe Indian population.61 James Churchward wrote a number of books on thecivilisation of Mu and he says the Nagas also populated China, Tibet and partsof Asia. The Naga Maya people, with their mother goddess religion, were also theorigin of the Maya people of Mexico. Researcher Michael Mott writes in Caverns,Cauldrons, And Concealed Creatures:> “The Nagas are described as a very advanced race or species, with a> highly-developed technology. They also harbor a disdain for human beings, whom> they are said to abduct, torture, interbreed with, and even to eat. The> interbreeding has supposedly led to a wide variety of forms, ranging from> completely reptilian to nearly-human in appearance. Among their many devices> are ‘death rays’ and ‘vimana’, or flying, disk-shaped aerial craft. These> craft are described at length in many ancient Vedic texts, including the> Bhagavad-Gita and the Ramayana. The Naga race is related to another underworld> race, the Hindu demons, or Rakshasas. They also possess, as individuals,> ‘magical stones’, or a ‘third eye’ in the middle of their brows, known to many> students of eastern mysticism today as a focal point for one of the higher> chakras, or energy channel-points, of the human(oid) nervous system – the> chakra associated with ‘inner visions’, intuition, and other esoteric> concepts.” 62 For Nagas and Chitauri, read Anunnaki. Different names, same origins.The dragon kings and queensThe theme of ruling ‘royal’ families and emperors who claim descent and theirright to rule from the “serpent gods”, can be found across the ancient world.These bloodlines and connections were symbolised by royal emblems in the form ofa dragon, snake, sphinx, plumed serpent or the tree-cross or Ankh. In Egypt theyhad an order called the Djedhi (Jedi?) and the Dj meant serpent.63 Thus we havepharaohs of the serpent line called Djer, Djoser and Djederfra. The Royal Courtof the Dragon was established in Egypt in 2170 BC under Ankhfnkhonsu, and moreformally by Queen Sobeknefru in 1783 BC, to provide an institution for thepursuit of the work of the Dragon of al-Khem who is best known as Thoth orHermes.64 From al-Khem we get alchemy, the ‘Great Work’ of the Dragon. Note thatthe date of 1783 BC was around the period when the Hyksos appeared in Egyptianhistory. The most famous books attributed to Thoth are The Emerald Tablets andThe Pymander. The Emerald Tablets of Thoth talk about reptiles, specificallyshape-shifters, who seek to control the world, as we shall see later. I havementioned the way that crocodile fat, or messeh, was used in the coronation ofpharaohs and this became part of Celtic mythology also. The image of Messehevolved to become a Dragon, the emblem of kingship.65 Messeh, the holycrocodile, evolved into what we know as Sobek in Egypt, the crocodile god, whowas Suchos in Greek.66 The Royal Court of the Dragon continues to this day andis promoted by Sir Laurence Gardner, the author of a number of books about the‘royal bloodline’, which, he says, is the bloodline of Jesus. He calls it the“dragon bloodline”.In India, the Buddhist text, the Mahauyutpatti, lists 80 kings who descendedfrom the Nagas or “Serpent Kings”. Hindu legend says that the Nagas could take ahuman or reptilian form at will, what is called shape-shifting. This is also atrait of the Chitauri according to Credo Mutwa and I shall detail shortly someof the many experiences people have had in the modern world of this phenomena.The serpent ‘sea’ or ‘fish’ gods of Sumer and Babylon were said to be able tochange shape and look human whenever they chose. Shape-shifting is a commontheme. Across India the rulers claimed power because they descended from theNagas, who were described as offspring from the interbreeding of humans with theserpent gods. Accounts in the Indian epics also refer to how the reptilian Nagasintermingled with the white peoples and although their relationship was oftenone of conflict and distrust, the two interbred, the epics report, to produce areptilian-mammal hybrid that became … the Aryan kings.67 These serpentbloodlines became the ‘Divine’ royal bloodlines or ‘demi-gods’.The Chinese emperors were the same. They were known as Lung or Dragons and manyof the earliest emperors were depicted with reptilian features, very much likethe Nagas. They were described as part human, part serpent. One of them, calledHuang Ti, was said to have been born with a “dragon-like countenance”. It wasclaimed that he was conceived by a ray of golden light that entered his mother’swomb from the Big Dipper constellation.68 The Big Dipper includes the star AlphaDraconis, the star of the Egyptian god, Set. Alpha Draconis is an alleged homeof the reptilian ‘royalty’, the elite leadership, known as the “Draco”. OneChinese legend says that when he died Huang Ti transformed into an ethericdragon and flew to the realm of the immortals. In Media, now Turkey, theIranians knew their kings as Mar, which means snake in Persian. They were calledthe “Dragon Dynasty of Media” or “descendants of the dragon”. The earliest ofthe royal bloodlines of Central America claimed genetic descent from the serpentgods, Quetzalcoatl and Itzamna. The priest kings of the Peruvian Incas weresymbolised by the snake and they wore bracelets and anklets in the image of asnake. In the Mycenaean age in Greece, the kings were, in the words of authorJane Harrison, “regarded as being in some sense a snake”.69 Cecrops, the firstMycenaean king of Athens, was depicted as a human with a serpent tail. Another,Erectheus, who founded the Eleusinian Mystery School, was worshipped as a livesnake after his death and, according to legend, King Kadmus shape-shifted into alive snake when he died.70 The Sumerian accounts tell of flying serpents anddragons breathing fire (symbolic of their aerial craft?) and how the kings ofSumer, going back long before the deluge to some 240,000 BC, were “changelings”seeded by the union of the gods and humans. Sargon the Great, that famous rulerof the Sumer/Akkadian Empire, claimed this genetic origin. The very existence of“kingship” is reported in the Sumerian Tablets to have been a gift of thesegods. Equally clear is that they were reptilian gods with the many references bythe Sumerians to their gods as fiery, winged serpents.The ancient world abounds with stories of the serpent or dragon race and royalkings, queens and emperors who claim their right to rule through their descentfrom the serpent gods. The kings of the succession in the reptilian bloodlineswere known as “Dragons”. When many kingdoms joined together in battle, or as agroup of kingdoms, they appointed a king of kings. These were known as the GreatDragon or … Draco. I found direct references to this theme in the Indian(formerly Indus Valley) works, like the Book of Dzyan, one of the oldest ofSanskrit accounts, and the epics, Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The Book ofDzyan tells of how a reptilian race it calls the Sarpa or Great Dragons camefrom the skies to bring civilisation to the world. A deluge, the Biblical GreatFlood, ended the Golden Age, it says, but the serpent gods survived and returnedto rule. They are described symbolically as having the face of a human, but thetail of a dragon.71 Their leader was called the Great Dragon and theIlluminati’s Ku Klux Klan, created by that infamous Freemasonic ‘god’ inAmerica, Albert Pike, still uses the term Grand Dragon today. The Celtic titleof Pendragon, as in Uther Pendragon, the father of “King Arthur” in the Grailstories, was also a version of this. Pendragon = “Great Dragon”. In the legends,the symbolic Arthur was a descendant of the dragons and his helmet carried adragon motif. The red dragon symbol of Wales comes from the claim by Merlin,Arthur’s “magician”, that the red dragon symbolised the people of Britain.Merlin was described as only half human because he was the child of anunderground being and a human woman. The Arthurian stories include all theclassic elements of the theme, including the creation of royal bloodlinesthrough the interbreeding between humans and non-human entities, shape-shifting,the use of holographic images to hide a being’s true form and battles betweencompeting dragons. Geoffrey of Monmouth, the twelfth century historian, saidthat Merlin’s earlier name had been “Ambrosius”, thus possibly associating himwith the Greek term for menstrual blood, Ambrosia, which the Reptilians love todrink.72 There is also the theme of the “Lady of the Lake” and this connectswith the stories of goddess-worshipping serpent peoples like the Nagas living inunderground centres located under lakes and lochs. Like the Celtic myth andfolklore, the ancient Greek culture was inspired by the Sumerians and Egyptiansand the earlier Atlanteans and Lemurians and was based almost entirely on theirstories and myths under different names. Throughout the Sumer Empire the peopleworshipped serpent gods and as the Reverend John Bathhurst Deane wrote in hisbook, The Worship of the Serpent:> “… One of [the] five builders of Thebes [in Egypt] was named after the> serpent-god of the Phoenicians, Ofhion … The first altar erected to Cyclops at> Athens was to ‘Ops’, the serpent deity … The symbolic worship of the serpent> was so common in Greece that Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing> it into the mysteries of all their gods.” 73 The Merovingian bloodlineOne of the key human-reptilian ‘royal’ bloodlines later became known as theMerovingians, who were known as sorcerers or “priest kings”, just as thepharaohs were in Egypt. The Merovingians were the royal line of a people knownas the Sicambrian Franks. Francio, who gave his name to the Franks and died in11 BC, claimed to be a descendent of Noah (Sumer). The Franks called themselvesNewmage or “the People of the Covenant”. The Egyptians also believed they werethe chosen people and had a covenant with God, a theme transposed bypost-Babylonian Levite scribes to the Egyptian ‘Israelites’. But for ‘God’ readreptilian ‘gods’. The Merovingians/Franks can also trace their bloodline fromancient Troy and the Trojan Wars, up through the Caucasus Mountains into what isnow France, a land to which they gave their name. Once again the Caucasus, thisbloodline melting pot, was involved. At one time the Sicambrian Franks settledin an area west of the Danube and were known as the Scythians, whom the Romanscalled “the genuine ones”. Legend says that Merovee, the founder of theMerovingians, who died in 458 AD, was seeded by a reptile and this bloodline isrelated to every royal family in Europe and a stream of others in positions ofinfluence and control. The founding names of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith andBrigham Young were both Merovingian bloodline and that’s why theMormon-controlled state of Utah has a beehive at the centre of its seal (Figure31). The bee or beehive is an ancient symbol of the Merovingian bloodline, as isthe fleur-de-lis, so beloved of British Merovingian royalty. The hive is thesymbol of the queen bee, the Illuminati reptilian goddess at the heart of theirsymbolism, and it also relates to the ‘hive’ mentality of the Reptilians thatthey have been seeking to transfer to humans. The Greek deity Zeus was depictedas an eagle (phoenix?) and a serpent to whom offerings of honey were made andthis is a possible connection to the Merovingian bee symbol.74 The themes of theserpent and honey can be linked to the ‘Tribe of Dan’, which is claimed to beone of the ten lost tribes of Israel. But are they really lost or did they neverexist in the form portrayed by Levite ‘history’? The Tribe of Dan also used thesymbols of the serpent and the eagle and I have written about them at somelength in The Biggest Secret. I do not believe they are the Israelites of theBible. Genesis says that the Danites did not have a known genealogy and were notrelated to the early Israelites.75 They were a sea-faring people (the Danuna orDenyen to the Egyptians) and many settled in northern Europe. The names ofDenmark (Danmark), the River Danube and Ireland’s Tuatha de Danann or “People ofthe Goddess Danu”, would seem to be expressions of the Danites and this is onereason why there is such a North African influence in Irish history.Image [../Images/00036.jpg]Figure 31: The state seal of Utah dominated by the beehive, the ancient symbolof the Merovingian bloodline that created the Mormon ‘Church’ The Egypt-Sumer-connected Phoenicians made the same sea journeys as the Danitesand they were almost certainly the same people. The Danite colours were red andwhite, just like the Phoenicians, and these are the colours of the KnightsTemplar that has its famous red cross on the white background displayed as theflag of England or the Flag of St George. This is a Phoenician deity calledGeorge of Cappadocia in what is now Turkey, the same country as Troy. Anotherstrand of the Danite-Phoenicians became the Merovingians and, it is suggested bysome researchers, the Khazars in the Caucasus. The works of the Greek poet,Homer, who lived around the 9th or 8th century BC, are the main source ofinformation about ancient Troy and the conflicts that led to its demise. The twoepics the Iliad and the Odyssey are ascribed to him and modern archaeologicaldiscoveries have confirmed the accuracy of Homer’s work. According to the Iliad,the founder of Troy was named Dardanus, who was said to be the son of the godZeus. Not surprisingly then that the symbols of Zeus and the Danites, theserpent, eagle and bees are the same. Dardanus had a son named Erichthonius andhis son was named Tros, who gave his name to the Trojans and their capital city,Troy, from whom the bee-symboled Merovingians claim descent. (Trois is theFrench word for “three” and this is an extremely important number to theIlluminati, as in the Babylonian Trinity, and this is symbolised in thethree-pointed fleur-de-lis, a symbol of the Merovingian bloodline and,therefore, the British royal family). Tros had a son called Assaracus and aprince of the royal house of Assaracus is credited with founding the RomanEmpire. His name was Aeneas and we will see shortly that this guy is massivelyimportant to the Illuminati bloodline. The Merovingians are associated withArcadia in Greece, home of the Spartans, one of the protagonists in the TrojanWars. Some Spartans migrated to Troy (in today’s Turkey) and up into France,settling in the province of Lorraine. This is a long time major centre for theIlluminati Reptilian bloodlines. In the apocryphal book 1 Maccabees, a letterfrom Areus, King of Sparta, tells a Jewish High Priest that the Spartans are “…of the race of Abraham”.76 In other words – Egyptian/Sumerian. The Spartanking’s letter said that his symbol was an eagle holding a dragon in its claws.77Here we go again. Fritz Springmeier, a long-time researcher of the Illuminatibloodlines, refers to the Merovingians as the “13th bloodline” because it weavesits DNA through the other 12 major families.78 It also most appropriate that theaccounts of the Merovingian-connected Trojan Wars involve the story of the‘Trojan Horse’ and you could not have better symbolism of the way the bloodlinesinfiltrate their target societies.The Merovingians were supposed to have died out long ago, but in reality onlythe name disappeared, until recently, and not the bloodline. The geneticscontinued with the King of the Franks called Charles, more famously known asCharlemagne, to whom 34 of the 43 US presidents and so many other key figuresare related. He vastly extended the Frankish domains and ruled as Emperor of theWest in the papal empire created and controlled by the bloodlines descendingfrom the Roman Empire. These, in turn, descended from the royal lines of theSumer Empire, Babylon and Egypt, who descended from the Atlanteans, Lemuriansand the hybrid interbreeding programmes. Charlemagne was a contemporary of theKhazars. The Priory of Sion (“Tsion” in Hebrew means mountain or desert monument– Zion) claims to be an elite secret society created in the twelfth century toserve the Merovingian bloodline or “Le Serpent Rouge” (the serpent blood). Itsays it was very closely connected to the Knights Templar who were officiallyformed at the French city of Troyes, named by the Sicambrian Franks(Merovingians) after their former home in Troy. Prince Paris from the TrojanWars stories also inspired the name of the French capital city. Another of thekey figures in Illuminati genealogy is Alexander the Great, an ancestor ofCharlemagne and all the major Illuminati families today. Alexander descendedfrom the Viking peoples who settled the Mediterranean and the Aegean after thecataclysms and may well have become the white peoples of the region, includingthe Danites. Alexander ruled Troy at one stage and, before he died in Babylon in323 BC at the age of 33, his army had seized control of an enormous region onceruled from Sumer. This included Egypt, Mesopotamia and into India. He foundedthe city of Alexandria in Egypt and, as he was known as the “Serpent’s Son”,Alexandria became the “City of the Serpent’s Son”.79 Once again we see therecurring theme. The legend goes that Alexander’s real father was the serpentgod, Ammon, and this mirrors the story of Merovee, founder of the Merovingiandynasty, of whom a similar origin is given. The Merovingians have been linkedwith the bloodline of ‘Jesus’ by a number of books, not least those by RoyalCourt of the Dragon promoter, Sir Laurence Gardner. But the ‘Jesus’ connectionisn’t necessary to make the link between the “dragon bloodlines” of Egypt andSumer and the Merovingians because they were transported to the Mediterraneanregion, Asia Minor/Turkey and elsewhere long before the era associated with‘Jesus’. The Illuminati are not going to have only one strand of the bloodlinethat is so important to them. The ‘Jesus’ bloodline is only code for theBabylonian/Serpent bloodline, anyway.Throughout history, the Reptilians have perpetuated their ‘purest’ bloodlines bymarrying as closely as possible to their own genetics and through the secretbreeding programmes. It is important to remember that these bloodlines do notjust breed through their official partners. They have stunning numbers ofchildren out of wedlock. These offspring are then brought up with names that aredifferent to the major Illuminati families like Rockefeller and Rothschild. Sowhen one of these children, called Clinton, Roosevelt or whoever, enters aposition of power, the people do not relate them to the elite families becausethey have a different name. But, and I can’t emphasise this enough, they are thesame bloodline. This is how they hide the tribe, the reptilian genetic network.Insider confirmationPhillip Eugene de Rothschild, who now lives in America, claims to be anunofficial offspring of Philippe de Rothschild of the French Rothschilds, andworked within the Illuminati Satanic network for most of his life. Phillip toldme that the key ‘Nefilim’ bloodline is connected to that figure called Aeneas,the alleged inspiration of the Roman Empire through his descendants, Romulus andRemus. The latter are code names for the bloodline and not real people and thatmay be the same with Aeneas. The legends of Aeneas fit with the codes and themesof the Illuminati bloodlines, including his association with Troy. Aeneas issaid to have been born in Troy, the city sacred to the Merovingians and theKnights Templar. In the Hymn to Aphrodite, the goddess proclaims that Aeneas,the son she has conceived by the mortal Anchises, will come to rule the Trojans,as will the generations upon generations that succeed him.80 In Homer’s Iliad,Aeneas recounts his birth and ancestry to his opponent Achilles on thebattlefield at Troy. Aeneas says that he descends from “Divine and immortalstock” through both his mother and his father. This connection between Divineimmortality and the Anunnaki under their various names constantly recurs inancient accounts. Aeneas says that his mother is the goddess, Aphrodite, and hisfather is Anchises, and he can trace his lineage back to Dardanus, the son ofZeus and legendary founder of the Trojan race. Aeneas is endowed in the Iliadwith a close relationship with the gods. The legends of Aeneas are peppered withreferences and codes about his genealogical connection to the ‘gods’ and it isno surprise that he plays such an important part in the codes and symbolism ofthe Illuminati bloodlines today.Phillip Eugene de Rothschild told me that this ‘Aeneas’ bloodline became what hecalled the “Rothsburg dynasty” – the union of the Bauer-Rothschilds (samefamily, different name) and the Battenbergs. This is the Merovingian bloodlineand also the line of the Habsburgs, the leading family in the Holy Roman Empirefor hundreds of years that again uses the symbol of the eagle, which follows thebloodline. The Greeks, Romans, Germans, French, Czarist Russia, the UnitedStates and many more have all displayed the symbol of the eagle/phoenix. TheHabsburg’s Holy Roman Empire was the medieval state that embraced most ofcentral Europe and Italy from 962 to 1806. Phillip Eugene says that this“Rothsburg” bloodline is known within the Illuminati as the “Gens”. This is aLatin word meaning “race”, “tribe” or “male line of descent” and comes from theterm gignere – “to beget”. The late Lord Louis Mountbatten, a famous member ofthe British royal family, and his nephew, Prince Philip, are Battenbergs. It wasLord Mountbatten who arranged the marriage between Prince Philip and QueenElizabeth II, after which the royal line of the UK became known as Windsor-Mountbatten. Both the Windsors and the Mountbattens are German bloodlinesformerly known as the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the Battenbergs. Theyanglicised their names during the First World War against Germany for publicrelations reasons, but both of these ‘families’ supported the Nazis, and PrincePhilip was sent to a school in Germany run by the Nazi youth programme (see AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret). Phillip Eugene, theRothschild offspring, says of this ‘Aeneas’ bloodline:> “Apparently Aeneas embodies all the various bloodlines that must trace their> lineage back through Charlemagne because in him is embodied the confluence of> the lineage of both David (Jewish[Egyptian]) and Alexander the Great (Aryan).> It is the modern day representatives of these Roman ‘Gens’ or European> monarchs that make up the ruling ‘aristocracy’ of the revived Roman Empire.> These ‘royal’ families maintain their pedigree through endogamy> (inter-familial marriages). The first prototype of the Antichrist [the purest> bloodline] was Nimrod, founder of Babylon. The historical and seminal nexus of> this last Roman Empire is Charlemagne and his descendants, people like> [Prince] Philip Mountbatten (Rex Julius Alexander Battenberg) who is one of> the ruling heads of the Julian Gens.” 81 Dracula = DracoAs I have detailed in other books, the Illuminati bloodlines are seriously intohuman sacrifice and blood drinking ritual and have been throughout theirexistence. They perform the same rituals today as they did in Babylon, theirancient headquarters after the demise of Sumer, although I think there was amuch earlier version of Babylon, also. The story of Dracula originates from thistheme. It was written by the Irish author Bram Stoker and published in 1897.Stoker probably knew the score after years of research into the countlessvampire legends. As a History Channel documentary about Stoker confirmed, thereis no part of the world and no era of history that does not have its myths andlegends about vampires who feed off other people’s energy and blood. Draculacontains all the familiar themes. His name is Dracula (the Draco are claimed tobe the ‘royal’ reptilian bloodlines); he is called “Count” Dracula (symbolic ofthe way these Draco bloodlines have been carried by ‘human’ royalty andaristocracy); he ‘shape-shifts’ (like the Reptilians) and he is a vampire(symbolic of the need of the Draco Reptilians to drink human blood and feed offhuman energy, as I shall detail shortly). Many famous writers and artists wereinitiates or dogged researchers who told elements of the story through art and‘fiction’. Stoker’s character was largely based on a man called Dracula or Vladthe Impaler, the fifteenth century ruler of a country called Wallachia, not farfrom the Black Sea in what is now Romania (Rom = Reptilian bloodlines). Thisregion was once called Transylvania, the home of the most famous vampirelegends. The Danube River valley, which runs from Germany to Romania and intothe Black Sea, comes up very often in the history of the bloodlines. These wereonce the lands of the Khazars and so many strands of the Illuminati bloodlineshave passed through here, including the Merovingians.Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula, slaughtered tens of thousands of people andimpaled many of them on stakes. He would sit down to eat amid this forest ofdead bodies, dipping his bread in their blood. He usually had a horse attachedto each of the victim’s legs and a sharpened stake was gradually forced into thebody. The end of the stake was oiled and care was taken that the stake not betoo sharp; he didn’t want the victim dying too quickly from shock. Infants wereoften impaled on the stake forced through their mothers’ chests. The recordsindicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down onthe stake. Death by impalement was slow and painful. Victims sometimes enduredfor hours or days. Dracula had the stakes arranged in various geometric patternsand the most common was a ring of concentric circles. The height of the spearindicated the rank of the victim, an excellent indication of the ritual-obsessedReptilian mind. The decaying corpses were often left there for months. It wasonce reported that an invading Turkish army turned back in fright when itencountered thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the Danube. In1461, Mohammed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, a man not noted for hissqueamishness, was sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses rottingoutside of Dracula’s capital of Tirgoviste. The warrior sultan turned overcommand of the campaign against Dracula to subordinates and returned toConstantinople. Ten thousand were impaled in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu,where Dracula had once lived. On St Bartholomew’s Day, 1459, Dracula had thirtythousand merchants and others impaled in the Transylvanian city of Brasov. Oneof the most famous woodcuts of the period shows Dracula feasting amongst aforest of stakes and their grisly burdens outside Brasov while a nearbyexecutioner cuts apart other victims. Impalement was Dracula’s favouritetechnique, but by no means his only method of inflicting unimaginable horror.The list of tortures employed by this deeply sick man included nails in heads,cutting off limbs, blinding, strangulation, burning, cutting off noses and ears,mutilation of sexual organs (especially in the case of women), scalping,skinning, exposure to the elements or wild animals, and boiling alive. No onewas immune to Dracula’s attentions. His victims included women and children,peasants and great lords, ambassadors from foreign powers and merchants.Vlad the Impaler was the son of Vlad Dracul, who was initiated into the ancientOrder of the Dragon by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1431. Its emblem was a dragon,wings extended, hanging on a cross. Father Vlad wore this emblem and his coinagebore the dragon symbol. All the members of the order had a dragon on their coatof arms and he was nicknamed Dracul (the Devil or the Dragon). Son Vlad signedhis name Draculea or Draculya or the “Devil’s Son” and this later becameDracula, a name that translates as something like “Son of Him who had the Orderof the Dragon”. Most appropriate. The ancient Order of the Dragon began in Egyptand expanded through the period of the Hyksos kings whose symbol was the snake.This is the same Dragon Order that is today promoted by the British ‘Holy Grail’author, Sir Laurence Gardner. By the way, Queen Mary or Mary of Teck, the motherof King George VI and therefore grandmother to the present Elizabeth II, wasdescended from a sister of “Dracula”. These are the bloodlines and the mentalitythat seek to conquer the world today. That’s why they have no compassion orempathy with the suffering, death and destruction they cause.Thinking reptilianAgainst this background of the reptilian connection, if you study the reptilianmind you can understand both the behaviour of the Illuminati across thecenturies and the global society they are creating. They have distinct charactertraits and they are seeking to make humans the same. The most ancient part ofthe human brain is known by scientists as the R-complex or “reptilian brain”(Figure 32). It is the most obvious remnant of our reptilian genetic history.Most people have no idea of the reptilian heritage of the human body and itsinfluence on our behaviour. Scientists say that the reptilian brain represents acore of the nervous system, and look at the character traits of the reptilianbrain as agreed by scientists. I quote here from an Internet article by SkipLargent:> “At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain. Without> defining them, I shall simply say that in human activities they find> expression in: obsessive compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals and> superstitious acts; slavish conformance to old ways of doing things;> ceremonial re-enactments; obeisance to precedent, as in legal, religious,> cultural, and other matters and all manner of deceptions.” 82 Add to that the other traits of the reptilian brain such as cold bloodedbehaviour with no empathy with the victims of your actions; ‘territoriality’ –controlling the world around you; an obsession with hierarchical structures ofrule and control; aggression; and the idea that might is right, winner takesall. What you have in those character traits of the reptilian brain are the verycharacteristics displayed by the Illuminati and their agents for thousands ofyears. You could not describe them better. Racism comes from the reptilian brainand the aggressive, violent sex that the Illuminati bloodlines indulge in bigtime – ask Father Bush, Cheney, President Gerald Ford and other Illuminati namesI expose in my books. Can it really be a coincidence that the Illuminatimanifest the classic traits of the reptilian brain while, at the same time, theevidence mounts that they are reptilian bloodlines? Cosmologist Carl Sagan, whoknew far more than he was telling, wrote a book called The Dragons of Eden83 tohighlight the reptilian influences on humanity. He said: “It does no goodwhatsoever to ignore the reptilian component of human nature, particularly ourritualistic and hierarchical behaviour. On the contrary, the model may help usunderstand what human beings are really about.” Other areas of the human brainbalance the extremes of the reptilian characteristics in most people, but theycan still be seen, for instance, in those who live their lives as a daily ritualrepeating the same cycles over and over week after week. The Illuminati havesought to turn society into a clock-watching, ever-repeating cycle, because thatlocks the people into their reptilian level of perception and further activatesthe reptilian brain. Those with the most dominant reptilian genetics, theIlluminati, obviously express more of the characteristics associated with thereptilian brain and this is why the Illuminati are utterly obsessed with ritual.Image [../Images/00037.jpg]Figure 32: The oldest part of the human brain is known as the R-complex orreptilian brain. From here we get the character traits of cold-bloodedbehaviour, a desire for top-down structures of control, and an obsession withritual. The more reptilian we are in nature, the more these traits will dominate Global conquestWith typical synchronicity since my experience on the mound in Peru, I receiveda book through the mail in the last few days before this manuscript wascompleted. This chapter was already finished. The book was called Blue Blood,True Blood 84 and contained information about the reptilian bloodline thatmatched so much of my own research and my own feelings about what is going on.Once again, I don’t necessarily agree with everything in the book, but in themeit matches my own view very closely. The author is Stewart Swerdlow who says hewas one of the few survivors of the Illuminati mind control and geneticsprogrammes at Montauk on Long Island, New York. As a youngster Stewart waskidnapped at night by what he thought were extraterrestrials and taken toMontauk. He later learned that his kidnappers were military officials posing asETs – this has been a common ruse to hide the truth of who is doing theabducting. He was forced into the Montauk genetic experiment program and hefound out much later that he was among only one per cent who got out alive.During his years under Illuminati control, Stewart says that he learned aboutthe agenda for global control and the non-human entities behind it all. Theseentities, he writes, are reptilian. He says he saw reptilian beings at Montaukand they “seemed to pop in and out of physical reality”.85 The following is asummary of what Stewart says he learned during the Montauk years and in hisresearch and experiences since then.Many and various extraterrestrial groups have come to this planet and seeded thedifferent races. Atlantis was dominated by a white or Caucasian people calledthe Atlans. They were from the star system known as Lyrae or Lyra while areptilian race located on Mu or Lemuria in the Pacific. The original Lyrianswere not physical as we understand that word, but they became trapped in thisdimension and their vibrations became ever denser. They had blond hair and blueeyes with the occasional red hair and green eyes. Credo Mutwa told me about atall, blond-haired, blue-eyed, extraterrestrial that Africans called the Mzungu.He said that when the white Europeans first arrived in South Africa the tribespeople thought they were the returning Mzungu and called them by that name. Youcan see Credo’s painting of the Mzungu in Figure 33. The Reptilians, Swerdlowsays, were created by those he calls the “transparent people” who “cannot reallyenter into the physical dimensions because their energy vibratory rate is sohigh that it cannot sustain a physical body”. When they appear, he says, “Itlooks like a transparent glass shell.” 86 At first, the Reptilians were“borderline physical” and to function here they needed a physical form. This wasachieved by mixing reptilian genes with those of the Lyrians. This is why, as weshall see, the Reptilians are so obsessed with blond and blue-eyed people – theyneed their genetics to operate in this reality. There you have the reason whythe deeply reptilian Windsors wanted the genes of blonde-haired, blue-eyedPrincess Diana and discarded her once they had them. Prince William isblond-haired and blue-eyed while Prince Harry has red hair. The Windsor line hadbecome so Reptilian with its interbreeding that it needed a massive infusion of‘Lyrian’ genes to maintain an apparently human form. The Reptilians were locatedin the Draco star system (hence “Dracula”, Vlad Dracul and the word “draconian”)and they began to expand across the galaxy by the sort of conquests we areexperiencing on this planet. Stewart Swerdlow says they have been assisted inthis by a race from Sirius, the brightest star seen from Earth. The Reptiliansare programmed to believe they are the superior form and believe themselves more“God-like” because they are androgynous. They have a programmed mentality thatwants to conquer everything. The British and Roman Empires are examples of thisat work.Image [../Images/00038.jpg]Figure 33: A blond-haired, blue-eyed “Mzungu” painted by Credo Mutwa. They lookvery much like the ‘Lyrians’ that Stewart Swerdlow describes The fusing of Reptilian genes with those of the Lyrians and others is why humanshave so much reptilian DNA, Swerdlow says, and why foetuses go throughreptilian-type development in the womb on their way to becoming ‘human’.87 TheReptilian- Lyrian hybrids were designed to be ‘tuned’ to the Reptilianfrequencies and could, therefore, be controlled by them. They wanted a 50-50 mixof genetics because that would produce a body that looked human while being ableto shape-shift into Reptilian. “Shape-shifting was accomplished simply byconcentrating on the genetics the hybrid wished to open, or lock up, whateverthe case may be”, writes Swerdlow.88 This makes sense of why Phillip Eugene deRothschild said that the importance of Charlemagne to the Illuminati (34 of the43 American presidents go back to him) was that he embodied the mixture of thebloodline of ‘King David’ (Egyptian/Hyksos/Reptilian) and Alexander the Great(“Aryan”). When the genetic domination is too far to the Reptilian side itbecomes impossible to hold human form and in these cases they consume humanhormones, flesh and blood to compensate. Human sacrifice and blood drinkingrituals have followed the bloodlines everywhere and this is why. Swerdlow saysthat the domesticated pig was developed for this purpose and thus it is so closeto human genetics. He also explains why royalty became known as the“Bluebloods”:> “Their blood, because of the increased Reptilian DNA, contained more of a> copper content. Since copper-based blood turns blue-green upon oxidizing,> these Reptilian hybrids were called ‘Bluebloods’.” 89 When Mu/Lemuria was destroyed, the survivors relocated to Northern India andinside the Earth where they built a massive underground civilisation. I willpresent evidence of this later. They also re-launched their genetic takeover andthe location they chose, says Swerdlow, was … Sumer. He says the Sumeriansbecame known as the Sum-Aryans or simply Aryans and they expanded into NorthAfrica, Central Asia, Northern India and the Steppes of Russia. “The Aryanleaders, all Bluebloods, became the Sultans and Rajas of legend”, writesSwerdlow.90 He says that when the Aryans mixed with the Dravidians (formerlyfrom Lemuria) in India, they created the Hindu religion. “The caste system ofIndia is a direct copy of the Reptilian division of function”.91 Once again theimportance of the Caucasus is confirmed:> “… [the Aryans] mostly established themselves in the Caucasus Mountains and> [later] became the Khazars. From here, they spread west towards Europe,> seeding the national identities for the Vikings, the Franks, the Teutonic> peoples and the Russians. Keep in mind that when Atlantis sank, some of those> refugees went to western Europe and developed into the Celts. Some went to> Greece and others to the Italian Peninsula. These peoples were here before the> hybrids moved in … These Blueblood leaders also infiltrated the Middle Eastern> peoples, such as the Biblical Canaanites, Malachites and Kittites.” 92 So what did happen in Egypt?This brings us to Egypt and what really happened with the Hyksos story. Swerdlowsays, quite rightly, that the Egyptians also became known as the Phoenicians andwere descendents of Atlantis. This was also the Tribe of Dan, I would suggest.As ‘Lyrians’, they were blond-haired and blue-eyed with some that weregreen-eyed and red-haired. These were the people who located in the BritishIsles and the Americas as archaeological evidence and other finds have shown(see The Biggest Secret). The Sumer-Aryans infiltrated Egyptian society andimplanted their Reptilian bloodline into the royal families of the pharaohs. Soit is quite correct, at least symbolically, that “Abraham” is said to have comefrom the Sumer region that is now Iraq. At the same time it could also becorrect, as Ralph Ellis says, that the Hyksos “Shepherd Kings” or “Leaders ofForeign Lands” were already in Egypt and did not invade. The Sumer infiltrationbegan before the Hyksos period and it could well be that the time of royal andreligious conflict was actually the battle for supremacy by the ReptilianBluebloods in royal and religious affairs. The Hyksos symbol was the snake andtheir colour was red – highly significant in Reptilian ritual. Remember, theirkings wore the Red Crown. The Egyptian ceremonial title of Moche means, “He whois anointed with crocodile fat from the Nile River”.93 Swerdlow says the term“Sun God” was a Reptilian symbol and so was the lion. Both abound in ancientEgypt, as they do in the Reptilian religions and royal families to this day. TheRoyal Court of the Dragon (also known as The Brotherhood of the Snake) wasformed in Egypt to infiltrate the royal and religious centres of power. Manly P.Hall, the Freemasonic historian, summarises what happened in Egypt, although for“black magicians of Atlantis” read “Reptilians” who also infiltrated Atlantis:> “While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil,> there arose from its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or black> magic, [in Egypt] … the black magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise> their superhuman powers until they had completely undermined and corrupted the> morals of the primitive Mysteries … they usurped the position formerly> occupied by the initiates, and seized the reigns of spiritual government. > “Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralysed the intellectual> and spiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete and> unhesitating acquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priest craft. The> Pharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council – a committee of> arch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood.” 94 Note “Scarlet Council”. This is what happened wherever the Blueblood Reptilianslocated. Babylon was a prime Reptilian centre, as I have been stressing allthese years. It was the place where the Reptilian bloodlines organised theBlueblood blueprint for global conquest, not least through manufacturedreligions. Swerdlow writes:> “Babylon was the civilization that Sumer developed into as it expanded into> Central Asia to become the Khazars. In fact, many of the Blueblood> organisations that developed through the millennia called themselves Babylon> Brotherhoods. [They] later combined with the secret Atlantean-Egyptian schools> in Europe to become the Freemasons. Some of these immigrants went by the name> of Bauer, now known as the Rothschilds. The family quickly took control of the> financial and trade foundations of Europe.” 95 Babylon’s modern expression is London and this is referred to by someresearchers as Babylon-don. The Babylon god and goddess, Nimrod and Semiramis,were depicted as half-human, half-reptile, and to enter that Illuminatistronghold, the financial district called the City of London, you pass flyingreptiles on both sides of the street. The City’s emblem is two flying reptilesholding the Phoenician/Knights Templar symbol of the red cross on the whitebackground (Figures 34 and 35, overleaf). This is symbolic of the mixedReptilian/Sum-Aryan genetics with the Reptilians in control. The British royalcrest is a lion and a unicorn (Reptilian and Sum-Aryan) with the unicorn’s hornrepresenting the penis. It symbolises the two genetics that come together tocreate the royal bloodline represented by the shield. The Reptilian control isemphasised by the unicorn always being tethered (see Figure 36). The crest ofthe Rothschild family is virtually identical (Figure 37) and you can see asimilar theme with the logo of the truly appalling Christian television networkin the United States called Trinity Broadcasting, which also includes the symbolof the dove – Babylon’s Queen Semiramis (Figure 38). It is the same as thebeliefs of the Reptilian Nazis, who considered the Sum-Aryans to be the “MasterRace”. Where the City of London meets the area called Temple Bar, or “TheTemple”, named after a Knights Templar church, there is another flying reptilein the centre of the road (Figure 39). The Temple is the headquarters of theglobal legal profession and this area, together with the City of London, hasmore elite secret societies per square mile than almost anywhere else on Earth.Image [../Images/00039.jpg]Figure 34: The crest of the City of London, the financial district and sovereignstate within the British capital and one of the major global centres for theIlluminati Reptilian network.

London’s Temple district is the headquarters of the British (andNorth American) ‘legal’ system Stewart Swerdlow says that the Reptilians also developed hybrid bloodlines witha race from Rigel in the Orion system that became the royal bloodlines of Chinaand Japan and this is another reason why the Caucasus and Eastern Europe are sosignificant. It was into this region that the ‘Golden Horde’ and others camefrom the Far East to interbreed with the Sumer Reptilian ‘royal’ bloodlines tocreate a very important genetics from the Reptilian point of view. Since thoseancient times, the bloodlines and the Illuminati secret society network throughwhich they manipulate have worked to place their operatives into the positionsof power over the population. As they expanded across the world, they used thesame techniques of manipulation everywhere to increase their power over thepeople and now they are seeking to complete their long-term goal – globalcontrol.These are the bloodlines behind the World Wars; September 11th and the ‘war onterrorism’; and all the needless suffering, conflict and depravation that we seeacross the world. It doesn’t have to be like this. It is just that theReptilians want it to be.SOURCES > 1L.A.

As usual since themound in Peru, this theme appeared suddenly and I began to walk into a mass ofinformation about the same subject. This has happened so many times.In a period of about 15 days in 1998 I met 12 separate people in differentlocations around the United States, from very contrasting backgrounds, who toldme the same basic story of seeing a ‘human’ change or ‘shape-shift’ into areptilian form before their eyes. Among them were two television interviewerswho saw their guest, a supporter of the New World Order agenda, shape-shift from‘human’ to reptilian. Afterwards one said he had been shocked to see the man’sface turn reptilian and the other, equally shocked, said that she had seen hishands take on a reptilian appearance. A friend of one of the presenters was apoliceman in Denver, Colorado, a major Illuminati and Satanic centre, wherereptilian gargoyles (an Illuminati code) and Freemasonic imagery adorn theDenver Airport. The policeman had made a routine visit to an office block inAurora, near Denver, and commented to an executive of one of the companies thereabout the high level of security in the building. She said that he should lookat the upper floors if he wanted to see some real security. She pointed to alift that only went to the higher floors and she told him of an astonishingexperience she had some weeks earlier. The lift had opened and a strange figureemerged. He was albino-white with a face shaped like a lizard and eyes withpupils that were vertical like a reptile’s. I was to hear many such descriptionsin the months ahead. This white lizard figure had walked out of the restrictedlift, she said, and into an official-looking car. The policeman was so intriguedby the story and the building that he made investigations into the companies inthe upper floors. According to his friend, he said he found them all to befronts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA.Another man I met in that 15 days used to take large quantities of LSD in the1960s and around the third day of a five-day ‘trip’, as he put it, the samething always happened: some people began to look like reptiles and it was alwaysthe same people. It never changed. He also began to observe that his friends whoappeared lizard-like in his ‘trips’ seemed to react the same way to movies,television programmes and so on. “We used to laugh and say ‘here come thelizards’”, he told me. Drugs take people into altered states of consciousnessand this can cause them to ‘retune’ their dial to other frequencies ofexistence. At this point they will see other levels of the people around them,beyond the five-senses. Looking back from a perspective of greater knowledge, hebelieved there is what he calls a “morphogenetic field” transmitted to the DNAof the lizard people and this aligned the cell structure to the reptiliangenetic blueprint. The Olmec people of Central America, whose whole culture wasbased on serpent worship, used to take hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms thatthey called “the flesh of the Plumed Serpent”, and this took them intoother-dimensional awareness – the serpent frequency. I will discuss this furtherin the next chapter. In their rituals to the “serpent son” Dionysus (anotherversion of ‘Jesus’), the Greek initiates would drink strong wine and takemind-altering drugs and mushrooms to “unite with their Son of God”. At the endof those 15 days in the United States, when I was speaking at a Whole Life Expoevent in Minneapolis, a gifted psychic lady told me how she sees people inpower, like Henry Kissinger, George Bush, and Hillary Clinton, turn intoReptilians all the time. Once again she is accessing their frequency levelsbeyond the five-senses and beyond the ‘cover’ of an apparently ‘human’ form.I recalled at this stage that I had read something about Reptilians in a bookcalled Trance-Formation of America,1 which details the life of a remarkablewoman called Cathy O’Brien, a recovering victim of US government mindprogramming. Stewart Swerdlow was programmed in one of the mind and geneticmanipulation centres known as Montauk. For those new to my books, I shouldexplain a little background to this because it will be a recurring theme. Sincethe early 1990s, I have been researching the mind-control technique known asMultiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), andI have written extensively about this and the experiences of its victims in TheBiggest Secret and Children of the Matrix. Basically, the mind fractures into aseries of apparent ‘personalities’, each with different attitudes, beliefs andoften ‘ages’. The Illuminati have created millions of these ‘multiples’ throughtheir trauma-based mind-control techniques to serve their agenda. Thesetechniques have been known for thousands of years, but their use expandedrapidly after the Second World War when Reptilian Nazis like the “Angel ofDeath”, Josef Mengele, perfected the concept through mass experimentation on theinmates of the concentration camps. They use a mechanism of the mind thatappears to ‘forget’ the memory of extreme trauma in the same way that thoseinvolved in a serious road accident do not remember the impact. Their minds havenot actually forgotten the experience and in fact they have retained it inphotographic detail. But the memory is held behind an amnesic barrier to preventthe horror being re-lived over and over by the conscious mind. It is a defencemechanism in its positive form.However, the Illuminati mind doctors and geneticists realised that if you couldsystematically traumatise someone, especially if you began before the age offive or six, you could fragment their minds into an almost endless honeycomb ofamnesic barriers that they call “alters”. Each of these alters believes it isthe whole mind and the only ‘personality’. The victims are given a ‘frontalter’, the ‘personality’ that interacts with daily life, and this is the‘person’ that others believe them to be. But behind the front alter are themultiple amnesic barriers created by the unimaginable trauma inflicted in themind-control programs. This includes violence, sexual abuse and Satanic ritualin which they see other children or animals sacrificed. Think of anything youwould find spine-chillingly horrific – then triple it – and that is what theymake these children experience. There are millions of such children and adultsaround the world. Once an alter has been created it can be programmed with a‘personality’ that performs tasks such as assassinating Illuminati targets orbeing sexually abused by some of the most famous people on Earth. If you don’tthink that’s true, read the detailed background in my other books or ask fatherGeorge Bush. You’re an expert, aren’t you, George? Why are so many assassinsdescribed as “lone nutters”? They are mind-controlled slaves of the Illuminatiand they are programmed to carry out the killings and hide the force that wasreally behind it. The front alter – the ‘front personality’ – of assassins andthose who go crazy with guns is often programmed to appear less than the fullpicnic. This means that after the killings people who knew them can tell themedia how they always did seem to be strange and weird. “Ahhh, the killer wasjust a nutter, then, case closed.” In the same way, children are ‘switched’ fromthe front alter to another ‘personality’ when they are abused by the rich andfamous. Once the trauma is over they are switched back again. The front alterhas no idea what the other alter has experienced and has no memory of the abuse.These people are also used to courier drugs for the Illuminati or pass messagesbetween their personnel because of the same potential for secrecy. They areswitched between alters by the use of hypnotic trigger keys in the form ofwords, sounds, hand signals or however they may be programmed to respond.This was the background of Cathy O’Brien. Her Satanic father, who had abused herviolently and sexually from the time she was a baby in Michigan in the 1950s,handed her over to Gerald Ford – later President Ford – for use in theIlluminati’s global mind-control programs. Cathy is blonde-haired and blue-eyed,the genetics of choice for so many mind-control programmes, and I recommend herbook, Trance-Formation of America, to anyone who wants to know what is happeningto literally millions and millions of children around the world. I lookedthrough the index to find the reptilian references and, although sherationalised the experience as a mind-control illusion, what she describes isthe same experience that so many others had been reporting and continue to doso. She described how leading US politicians she worked for in hermind-controlled state appeared to take a reptilian form before her eyes and thenreturn to ‘human’. These included President George Bush, father of PresidentGeorge “Dubya”, of the Anunnaki/Merovingian bloodline. Father George told herthey were an extraterrestrial race that had taken over the planet, but no onerealised it because they looked human. Cathy relates another importantexperience she had with Miguel de la Madrid, the President of Mexico duringfather Bush’s tenure at the White House. She writes in Trance- Formation ofAmerica:> “De La Madrid had relayed the ‘legend of the Iguana’ to me, explaining that> lizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, their> advanced astronomical technology, including sacrifice of virgins, was> supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens> interbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit, they> fluctuated between a human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like> abilities – ‘a perfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders’. De la> Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he> transformed ‘back into an Iguana at will’.” 2 This is exactly the same story in Central America that you find in Africa, Asiaand around the world and fits with Stewart Swerdlow’s information. ResearcherJames Churchward told in books like The Children of Mu3 that he established theMaya of Central America and the Nagas of Asia to be the same former Lemurianpeoples. The Mayans say the first settlers of the Yucatan in Mexico were theChanes or “People of the Serpent”. They were led by the god Itzamna, a name thatapparently comes from the word “itzem”, which translates as lizard or reptile.The sacred city of Itzamna, therefore, means “the place of the lizard” or“Iguana House”. I have been told by hundreds of people all over the world, fromevery walk of life you can imagine, about their experiences of seeing well-knownand less well-known people transform into a reptilian form before their eyes andthen go back again. Father George Bush is the name that recurs most often inthese accounts.Shape-shifting Prime MinistersSoon after returning from the USA and the rapid escalation of my reptilianresearch, I went to see a woman in England to discuss her knowledge of Satanicrituals, which, she said, involved people like Ted Heath, the formerConservative Prime Minister of Britain from 1970 to 1974. He signed the UK intothe Illuminati’s European Community, now Union, and has persisted to campaignfor our further absorption into this centralised fascist state. Governmentpapers were released after 30 years that showed how Heath knew that entry intothe European Community would eventually mean the end of British sovereignty. Butat the time he denied this because the Reptilians and their clones will saywhatever is necessary to achieve their ends.Heath comes up often when you speak with the victims of Satanic rituals – thosewho survive – and their torture as children. This lady was brought up by aScottish family and said she was sexually and ritually abused by the highlysignificant Scottish Illuminati network. As a result of this background, shebecame the wife of the warden of an area of woodland called Burnham Beeches, afew miles from Slough, west of London. It is an ancient site mentioned in theDomesday Book of the 11th century. Burnham Beeches is not far from both theBritish Prime Minister’s country residence called Chequers and the formerWycombe home of the Illuminati Hellfire Club with its human sacrifice ritualsinvolving royalty and the American ‘hero’, Benjamin Franklin (see The BiggestSecret). Burnham Beeches is owned by the City of London – ‘The Crown’. This isthe globally-important financial district of the British capital and one of themost powerful Illuminati operational centres on the planet controlled by theCrown Temple of the Knights Templar (see Appendix I). The ‘City’ of London doesnot mean the whole of the capital. It is the area surrounding St Paul’sCathedral where the original city stood and after the Great Fire of London in1666 it was rebuilt by initiates like Sir Christopher Wren. It is now asovereign state within the urban sprawl we call London and has its owngovernment. As I already highlighted, the coat of arms of the ‘City’ of London,an image you find all over Burnham Beeches, is dominated by two flying reptilesholding a shield adorned by the red cross on the white background used by theKnights Templar secret society. It is from this Illuminati centre that BurnhamBeeches is administered.The lady who told me about this area said that her husband, the warden in chargeof the place, was a Satanist. She said he had to be to get the job. They livedin a big house in the woods and part of his work was arranging Satanic ritualsthere. She said that one night in the early 1970s while Ted Heath was PrimeMinister, she was walking through the woods after dark when she saw some lights.Quietly, she moved forward to see what they were and to her horror she saw aSatanic ritual involving Heath and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, AnthonyBarber. She said that as she watched, hidden among the trees and undergrowth,Heath began to transform into a reptile and she said what staggered her most wasthat no one in the circle looked the least bit surprised. “He eventually becamea full-bodied reptiloid, growing in size by some two foot”, she said. This is acommon description by witnesses. She said he was “slightly scaly” and “spokefairly naturally”, although it sounded like “long distance – if you imagine theshort time lapses”. I met Heath once in a television station before I knew anyof this and I never forgot the coldness of his eyes or how they turned entirelyblack as he looked at me. There was no point where his eyes made contact withmine because they appeared to go on forever like two black holes into anotherdimension. I have heard many people describe a similar experience with peoplethey claim to have seen shape-shift. The woman told me that she had seen otherreptilian figures in Burnham Beeches at dusk or after dark, wearing long robeswith hoods.The reptilian WindsorsShortly after this meeting, I was introduced through a third party to thehealer, Christine Fitzgerald, who, as acknowledged in the tabloid media, was aclose confidant of Princess Diana for some nine years. You can read the fullstory of what she told me in The Biggest Secret. She knew nothing whatsoever ofmy then unpublished reptilian research, but a little way into our conversationshe told me that Diana called the Windsors “the Reptiles” and “the Lizards” andused to say, “They’re not human”. Christine went on to tell me that the Windsorswere a reptilian hybrid bloodline and how they had treated Diana in ways thatwere beyond the imagination. At the centre of this circle, she said, was thelate Queen Mother. Christine told me that Princess Diana used to call the QueenMother “evil”. I can think of no one on this planet, maybe even in history,whose real persona is more at odds with her manufactured image than the QueenMother. Christine said:> “The Queen Mother … now that’s a serious piece of wizardry. The Queen Mother> is a lot older than people think. To be honest, the royal family hasn’t died> for a long time, they have just metamorphosised. It’s sort of cloning, but in> a different way. They take pieces of flesh and rebuild the body from one> little bit. Because it’s lizard, because it’s cold-blooded, it’s much easier> to do this Frankenstein shit than it is for us. The different bodies are just> different electrical vibrations and they have got that secret; they’ve got the> secret of the micro-currents; it’s so micro, so specific, these radio waves> that actually create the bodies. These are the energies I work with when I’m> healing. > “They know the vibration of life and because they’re cold-blooded, they are> reptiles, they have no wish to make the Earth the perfect harmony it could be,> or to heal the Earth from the damage that’s been done. The Earth’s been> attacked for zeons by different extraterrestrials. It’s been like a football> for so long. This place is a bus stop for many different aliens. All these> aliens, they could cope with anything, including the noxious gases. They’re> landing all the time and coming up from the bowels of the Earth. They looked> like reptiles originally, but they look like us when they get out now through> the electrical vibration, that key to life I talked about. They can manifest> how they want to. All the real knowledge has been taken out and shredded and> put back in another way. The Queen Mother is ‘Chief Toad’ of this part of> Europe and they have people like her in every continent. Most people, the> hangers on, don’t know, you know, about the reptiles. They are just in awe of> these people because they are so powerful.” 4 I know it is hard to imagine and grasp the scale of the Queen Mother’sinvolvement through her life because your mind tells you she was a little oldlady. But, as with all of these people, what you see is just the front ‘human’image, not the real being. It is an extreme version of an agent in a foreignland operating behind a cover story of why he is there and what he is doing.It’s just that these people also have ‘cover bodies’ to hide their real naturefrom the five-senses of the population. We look at them with our five-senses andso that is the level of them that we see – their ‘human’ form. But behind thatthey look very different. Christine Fitzgerald was able to see what was going onbecause of her work with Diana and the aristocracy and her understanding ofenergy, vibrations and frequencies through her healing work. I have had to studyan unbelievable number of subjects and research so many different strands ofinformation before it was possible to put a picture together. That is one bigreason why it has rarely come to light like this before. There is so much toknow before you can see the pieces, let alone how they fit. The Illuminati havesuppressed all information that is necessary to see the picture and you have todo so much work to overcome that. You also need a mind that is free (or free-er)and willing to go anywhere the evidence leads.A few weeks after my meeting with Christine Fitzgerald in 1999, BrianDesborough, a scientist friend in California, told me there was a woman that Ihad to meet as soon as possible. This was Arizona Wilder, a recovering victim ofthe Illuminati mind-control network, who had worked for them at a very highlevel. She said she had conducted sacrificial rituals as a “Mother Goddess” forthe British royal family, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland and at anotorious centre for Satanic ritual known as the Mothers of Darkness Castle inBelgium. This is located in the same region as the headquarters of the cultresponsible for the widespread paedophilia, murder and child sacrifice that cameto light amid enormous public anger in 1994. The ring involved famous pillars ofBelgian society and a massive cover-up has ensued to keep it quiet. Belgium is amajor Illuminati Satanic centre and that’s why the European Union and NATO arebased there. Stewart Swerdlow names some other major locations for the ritualsas Land’s End and Loch Ness in the United Kingdom; Rennes-Le-Chateau andBrittany in France; Bavaria in Germany; Phoenix, Arizona; Montauk Point, NewYork; the Mojave Desert and Russian River (Bohemian Grove) in California; theeast coast of Florida; and the Channel Islands. He also cites the Great Pyramid(of course) and the great castles of Europe located over underground entrancesto the inner-Earth. These, he says, are most commonly found in Scotland (hencethe importance of this little country to the Illuminati), France, Switzerland,Belgium, Germany and Austria.5 One of these castles over an inner-Earth entranceis the Queen’s Scottish residence at Balmoral and the home of the late QueenMother called Glamis Castle in the north of the country. I note there is also aBlair Castle in Scotland, the seat of the Dukes of Atholl. Bilair, Bilar andBilid are names used for the chief demon in some rituals.Arizona Wilder’s original name had been Jennifer Greene. She is a blue-eyedblonde from a French aristocratic bloodline with significant Irish blood, too.When her mind and her memories began to return after the death of hercontroller, the Nazi Josef Mengele, she changed her name to Arizona Wilder, shetold me. Mengele, and the other leading Nazi geneticists, mind-controllers,scientists and engineers, escaped from Germany as the Allies arrived thanks to aBritish and American intelligence operation called Project Paperclip. Some veryfamous names are mentioned with compelling consistency by people like Arizona –father George Bush, Henry Kissinger, Dick Cheney, the British royal family, theRothschilds, Rockefellers and a long list of others detailed in my other books.Arizona is one of the many people with ‘multiple’ programming who are breakingdown the compartments and remembering their unimaginable experiences. In TheBiggest Secret and the video Revelations of a Mother Goddess, she tells herstory in detail and names the famous names involved on both sides of theAtlantic. She says she was chosen by them because of her bloodline. TheIlluminati- Reptilians literally breed people to conduct their rituals for them.Such people tend to be very psychic and are able to connect easily with energy.They manipulate its vibrational state and draw desired frequencies into rituals.From the moment a child of these ‘psychic’ bloodlines is born, in fact even inthe womb, they are subjected to trauma-based mind-control. The idea is to turnthem into compartmentalised people who can be ‘triggered’ to conduct the ritualsas programmed, but then ‘forget’ everything they did until that compartment isaccessed again for the next ritual. After the death of her controller, JosefMengele, in the 1980s, she said that another infamous mind-controller, Guy deRothschild, was brought in to “take me over”, but it didn’t work as before. Thisoften happens because the victim’s mind worships the one who originallyprogrammed them, especially if it was over a long period. When I met her,Arizona had escaped from mind-control, although there were many compartmentsstill to be accessed.The elite satanistsSupport for Arizona’s theme comes from Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, anotherrecovering mind-controlled Satanist, who tells part of his story on an excellentwebsite highlighting ritual abuse and mind-control.6 We also communicateddirectly on several occasions. Phillip, who uses another name in daily life,explains how his front alter or ‘presenter’ personality was that of a ‘good guy’Christian. But beyond that his subconscious was programmed as a Satanist as theunofficial son of a French Rothschild. His mother was Lula Vieta Pauline RussellCampbell, who was born in 1917 in Farmersville, Texas, and died in 1977. But, hesays, his real, biological, father, was not the man he had known as his fatherbefore his compartmentalised mind began to heal and remember. His geneticfather, he says, was Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton-Rothschild wineproducing estates in France, who died in 1988 at the age of 86. Phillip Eugenetold me: “My father was a decadent dilettante as well as a master Satanist andhater of God, but how he loved the fields and the wines. He used to say itbrought out ‘the primitive in him’.” The estates are now run by Baron Philippe’sdaughter, Baroness Philippine, who, Phillip Eugene says, is his half sister. Hewas, he writes, conceived by “occult incest” and was “one of the hundreds ofthousands of both legitimate and illegitimate offspring of this powerfulfinancial and occult family”. Much of this is done artificially throughIlluminati sperm banks. What Phillip says is confirmation of my own research, asoutlined in The Biggest Secret, that the main Reptilian bloodlines conceivecountless children to perpetuate the bloodline and only a few are given thebloodline name as ‘official’ children. The others are hidden behind other namesand brought up by other ‘parents’. Later they find themselves in significantpositions, often not knowing why they got so ‘lucky’. Phillip Eugene says thatfor most of his childhood and adolescence he lived with his Rothschild father onhis estate in France. They had a physical relationship, he says, and he was“held fast in the emotional power of incest, which, in this culture, was normaland to be admired”. He said he observed his Rothschild father’s “lust for power”and began to desire the same. He also confirmed the way the ‘occult’ bloodlinesare controlled by demonic entities. “Being a Rothschild descendant”, he said, “Iwas maximally demonised”. He continues:> “I was present at my father’s death in 1988, receiving his power and the> commission to carry out my destiny in the grand conspiracy of my family. Like> their other children, I played a key role in my family’s revolt from God. When> I watch CNN, it startles me to see so many familiar faces now on the world> stage in politics, art, finance, fashion, and business. I grew up with these> people meeting them at ritual worship sites and in the centers of power.> Financiers, artists, royalty, and even Presidents, all these dissociated> people work and conspire today to bring in a new world order … These people,> like me, are SRA/DID [Satanically ritually abused and Dissociative Identity> Disorder – ‘multiples’]. > “The last non-dissociative President of the United States was Dwight> Eisenhower; except for him, every one since Teddy Roosevelt has had some level> of dissociative disorder and some level of involvement in the occult.> President Clinton has ‘full blown’ multiple personality disorder and is an> active sorcerer in the Satanic mystery religions. This is true of Al Gore, as> well; I have known Misters Clinton and Gore from our childhood as active and> effective Satanists. > “Like the hundreds of thousands of this [Rothschild] occult family’s other> biological children, I had my place and function within this clan’s attempt to> control the world.

Constructed through> ritual but empowered by legions of spirits, I was a human and spiritual focus> of corporate Satanic energy into the ‘Body of Christ’.” 7 The Queen and human sacrificeArizona Wilder told me she had conducted sacrificial rituals involving theBritish royal family, Tony Blair, and famous American Illuminati names likeGeorge Bush, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger and many others.8 Shetold me that the head of the Illuminati, or the highest-ranked she knew, was aman called the Marquis de Libeaux from the key Reptilian bloodline centre ofAlsace-Lorraine in eastern France, which at times had been in German hands. Shesaid that he was known as Pindar or “Penis of the Dragon”. She didn’t know ifthe Marquis de Libeaux was his real name. Stewart Swerdlow says that Pindar or“Pinnacle of the Draco” is the head of the Rothschild family who “reports to thepure-bred Reptilian leader in the inner-Earth”.9 I guess the Marquis de Libeauxcould be code for a Rothschild. Swerdlow says in Blue Blood, True Blood that thethirteen leading Illuminati-Reptilian shape-shifter families are: Rothschild(Bauer), Bruce, Cavendish (Kennedy), de Medici, Hanover, Hapsburg [Habsburg],Krupps, Plantagenet, Rockefeller, Romanov, Sinclair/St Clair, Warburg (delBanco) and Windsor (the German house of Saxe-Coburg-Gothe. Other researchersgive slightly different names, but families like the Rothschilds, Rockefellersand Windsors are always named.Arizona told me how the Queen and Queen Mother regularly sacrificed babies andadults at many ritual centres, including Balmoral Castle in Scotland. This iswhere they were all staying at the time Diana was ritually murdered in Paris(see The Biggest Secret) and Tony Blair went up to join them. Arizona’s accountshave been supported by other ‘multiples’ I have met, not least those programmedand ritually abused within the Merovingian Mormon Church. The royal familyinvolved in human sacrifice was fantastic enough, but here again came theconstantly repeated theme. Arizona described how, during the rituals, thesepeople shape-shift into reptiles. Diane Gould, head of the US organisation,Mothers Against Ritual Abuse, also confirms this theme. In a telephoneconversation about ritual abuse, Diane asked me if I could explain why many ofher clients reported that participants in their rituals had turned intoreptiles. As I was writing this book, another therapist I met in Texas told meof similar accounts by her clients who had suffered in Satanic rituals and shesaid they had mentioned the familiar famous names to her with regard to therituals, including Tony Blair. People might want to dismiss all this, but theyshould know that, while they close their eyes and their minds, children arebeing sacrificed all over the world this very day by the Reptilian bloodlines –many thousands of them on the main ritual dates of the Satanic calendar like May1st and Halloween. Arizona Wilder talked about some of her experiences with theQueen and Queen Mother:> “The Queen Mother was cold, cold, cold, a nasty person. None of her cohorts> even trusted her. They have named an alter [mind-control programme] after her.> They call it the Black Queen. I have seen her sacrifice people. I remember her> pushing a knife into someone’s rectum the night that two boys were sacrificed.> One was 13 and the other 18. You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears> to be a frail old woman. When she shape-shifts into a Reptilian, she becomes> very tall and strong. Some of them are so strong they can rip out a heart and> they all grow by several feet when they shape-shift.” [This is what the lady> said who saw Edward Heath and it is a common theme in witness accounts.] Of the Queen, Arizona said:> “I have seen her sacrifice people and eat their flesh and drink their blood.> One time she got so excited with blood-lust that she didn’t cut the victim’s> throat from left to right in the normal ritual; she just went crazy, stabbing> and ripping at the flesh after she had shape-shifted into a Reptilian. When> she shape-shifts, she has a long reptile face, almost like a beak and she’s an> off-white colour. [This fits many depictions of the gods and ‘bird gods’ of> ancient Egypt and elsewhere.] The Queen Mother looks basically the same, but> there are differences. She [the Queen] also has like bumps on her head and her> eyes are very frightening. She’s very aggressive … > “… I have seen [Prince Charles] shape-shift into a Reptilian and do all the> things the Queen does. I have seen him sacrifice children. There is a lot of> rivalry between them for who gets to eat what part of the body and who gets to> absorb the victim’s last breath and steal their soul. I have also seen Andrew> participate and I have seen Prince Philip and Charles’ sister [Anne] at the> rituals, but they didn’t participate when I was there. When Andrew> shape-shifts, he looks more like one of the lizards. The royals are some of> the worst, OK, as far as enjoying the killing, enjoying the sacrifice, and> eating the flesh; they’re some of the worst of all of them. They don’t care if> you see it. Who are you going to tell, who is going to believe you? They feel> that is their birthright and they love it. They love it.” 10 Stewart Swerdlow describes similar scenes from his own experience and how thesacrifice is terrorised before “a final thrust of a blade disembowels thevictim, resulting in rivers of blood flowing over the crowd’s bodies”. He saysthat the frenzy is so high at this point that many begin to shape-shift intoReptilians and even attack each other mindlessly. If you have seen the 1998film, Blade, with Wesley Snipes you’ll get the picture. Swerdlow tells how thesacrifices are ripped apart as the internal organs and genitalia are consumed.“… The God and Goddess then chant ceremonial invocation to the astral planes. Ihave heard this chant in Latin, Hebrew, Ancient Egyptian, Sumerian, German,English and a guttural, hissing language which I was told is the original Dracolanguage.” 11 These are the people controlling our world.Arizona Wilder has been viciously attacked for what she said in The BiggestSecret and on her video. A campaign of character assassination has been waged,at one time almost daily on the Internet, to discredit her evidence and theReptilian connection in general. Arizona is an immensely brave woman and one ofthe few who will speak openly about her experiences. Most keep quiet becausethey think no one will believe them or they want to remain publicly anonymousbecause they fear the consequences of speaking out. For every person I name,like Arizona and Christine Fitzgerald, there are countless more who confirm thestory on the understanding that their identity and location will not be revealedpublicly, although I know the details. It has been claimed even by otherresearchers who will not leave the five-sense comfort zone that all my Reptilianinformation has come from only one person, Arizona Wilder. This is utternonsense. She is only one source and there are so many more that tell the samebasic tale.“Before my very eyes”One such case is a 57-year-old former chief of police, special agent and memberof the US military. He says he has guarded two presidents, two Secretaries ofDefense, and two chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the head of the USmilitary). He contacted me to say that he knows from his experience that “aliensexist” and that the government is lying about the Roswell ‘alien’ crash in NewMexico in 1947. He also told me of a “crystal skull” in his possession. But hismain reason for making contact was to tell me of an incident that showed to himthat shape-shifting Reptilians are real. When he arrived at a friend’s house inTexas, he was told that two women guests were coming from New York. Theytravelled around the country performing hands-on-healing and they had asked ifthey could drop by, he was told. This former chief of police told me in personalcorrespondence what happened next:> “I arrived before the New York people and had already started showing my> crystal skull when they arrived. They immediately went crazy [because of the> skull] and started holding their hands up before their eyes and screamed ‘Get> her out of here’ over and over. I can tell you that everyone was shocked by> their actions and I was extremely upset … I carried the crystal skull out to> the car and left it there. After about an hour everyone seemed to get over the> uproar they made and things settled down to discussions. Everyone introduced> themselves and the two from New York volunteered to heal someone. Well> everyone started telling them to do it to me because I had heart trouble and> was recovering from a heart attack. I hesitated, but finally relented and said> OK. > “They sprang over to me so fast that it startled me. One got behind me and one> straddled my legs in front of me. They did this without touching me and they> both started running their hands around my body again without touching me> anywhere. This went on for about a minute then my eyes met the eyes of the> lady in front of me. That was some experience, our eyes meeting. Pay attention> to what I say here. I could see immediately that she knew that I knew and it> broke her concentration. She lost control and changed into a Reptilian right> before my eyes. No sooner than she lost control, she regained it and> shape-shifted back into a human. All this took place in the blink of an eye.> They immediately jumped up and said that they had to leave and left within 30> seconds of this happening.” He said he did not say anything about what he had seen, but when everyone beganto leave, two guests stayed behind and would not move. Eventually they asked:“Did you see what we saw?” He asked them what they meant and they said they hadseen the lady “… change into a reptile and then change back”. People all overthe world, and from countless walks of life, have repeated this same experienceto me. This is the modern version of the experience the ancients described.A lady called Odette told of a reptilian experience at a house in Quebec,Canada. She was with a friend when another woman came over and began to talkabout UFOs and contactees. The woman said she was a contactee and she had ameeting with a spaceship on a certain date. She also said that they were takingher and she would never be back on Earth. Odette said she was not convinced atall and especially when the woman had said that if they could only see her realself, they would see how beautiful she is, like a princess inside. “I wasthinking, yeah right! Whatever!!!” Odette recalled. The woman looked around 30years old, tall and strong, light hair, cut to her shoulder, and was “ordinarylooking”. Then she asked Odette if she would let her reveal her real selfbecause she would never have seen anyone like her. But she said she neededOdette’s permission for this. Odette said yes because she thought, “Poor thing,she’s really miserable …” The account continues:> “We went to a quiet room. We sat facing each other, and she grabbed my hands,> told me to relax and just look at her. What I saw was a reptile, taller than> she was, at least 6 feet, green/brown colour, staring at me with its head> turned sideways, and I swear with something that seemed like a grin on its> face. Then she/it asked me ‘Didn’t I tell you I was beautiful?’ I said yes,> and headed for the door … If anybody has had a similar experience or knows of> a book that talks about reptilians please let me know.” 12 Church of Latter Day ReptilesA regular source of information about Reptilian activities and rituals are thosewho have been involved in ‘religious’ organisations, not least the Jehovah’sWitnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints (LDS), betterknown as the Mormons. Both were formed by members of the Merovingian bloodlinelike the Mormons, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and Charles Taze Russell ofthe Watchtower Society. These ‘Churches’ have been controlled ever since by theMerovingian Reptilian shape-shifters. A lady called Diana Huston told me of herexperiences with the Jehovah’s Witness mind-control sect, officially titled theWatchtower Bible and Tract Society.13 She joined them in 1969 because, aftergoing through the Vietnam War with her husband, she was attracted by the messageof paradise on Earth. She was OK for a few years, but then they became moredemanding and controlling. In 1987 she said that subliminal drawings began toappear in the artwork of their books and magazines depicting bizarre faces andstrange messages. At a small convention in September 1988, she spoke privatelyto one of the governing body ‘elect’. At that time she thought they were the‘good guys’. The man was about five-foot-ten with dark hair and was powerfullybuilt. She said that she looked into his eyes and was startled and terrified tosee a thin membrane drop over his human eyes. She didn’t know if the membranecame from the bottom of his eyelid or the top. “I’d never heard of lizardbeings, but I remember thinking how much his eyes looked like those of alizard”, she recalled. The membrane dropped over his eyes when he looked at herand he seemed to recognise her, although at the time she couldn’t imagine why.The sense of terrible danger that she felt, and the need to get away from him,was overwhelming. She went on:> “Eventually I came to understand that the leaders are not fully human, but are> the offspring of something alien to this Earth. They are too cunning, lethal,> and intelligent to have originated from here, and there has to be an over-race> of beings guiding them from some dimension. They are here for one reason only.> They look at humans as a source of enslavement for their enjoyment to torment> and abuse, to misuse power and to cruelly punish and kill.” 14 As she researched the religion’s documents and books, she said she began touncover a trail of arms and drug-running (which the Illuminati globallycontrols), and “plots to destroy the world and take it for their own”. Dianetook her “mountains” of evidence to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and metwith them. They said that she was either a genius or totally insane. She saidshe learned that the Watchtower Society had hidden rooms under the streets ofBrooklyn, New York, where they have their headquarters over the now-abandonedold Brooklyn subway. There they practice Satanic ritual, including the sacrificeof human infants, she said, and here they also keep women who are used as“breeders” for babies to be sacrificed. This happens all over the world becausethe babies are never officially registered and therefore never reported missing.To the system, they have never existed. The main Illuminati bloodlines alsoconceive children in the rituals. Diane wrote that this Watchtower Satanicoperation is totally self-sufficient and even uses blood in the ink of themagazines. She said that she and a friend tried to warn people through the mediawith no success (I am surprised!) and her friend had a nervous breakdown fromwhich she has never fully recovered.One of many accounts to come from former members of the Mormon “Church” was sentby a woman – I will call her “Jane” – who claims she suffered in a Mormonmind-control project from the time she was a young child. Cathy O’Brien saysthat the Mormon Church and especially the operation at Salt Lake City is a majormind-control centre and a former Mormon mind-slave, Sharon Jacobs, has talked tome at length about the rituals and Reptilian shape-shifters within the Mormonhierarchy. The overwhelming majority of Mormons have no idea what theirorganisation is really about. Former military sources claim that the MormonTemple in Salt Lake City, which is covered in Illuminati symbols like theall-seeing eye, stands over a large underground Reptilian “hive” that can beaccessed from the temple. “Jane” said she saw her babies sacrificed in Mormonrituals and that is a common theme of such accounts. Sharon Jacobs tells asimilar story. In her pursuit of the truth, Jane spoke with another victim ofritual abuse by the Mormon and Roman Catholic Church. This other lady told herthat the Mormon “Prophet” (the official head of the Church) had taken her babyfrom her at a ritual and eaten it. Two other women raised as Catholics told herthat they had seen the abusers shape-shift into Reptilians and eat a humansacrifice. Jane said that Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormons, was from“the occult bloodlines” (very true) and the whole official story was a lie. “Theleaders are mostly reptilian”, she said. “One witness says that only one of thetwelve [Mormon] apostles did not shape-shift at the ritual”. She goes on:> “I was so mad to find out that the alien abuse was connected to the ritual> abuse in the church when I had believed the church was true. [Now I know that]> … our families are from occult bloodlines of England and Europe. This has gone> on for hundreds and thousands of years.” 15 Sharon Jacobs has confirmed all of this and more and she names the major Mormonleaders involved. She tells of horrific sex and blood rituals under the SaltLake Temple in which goats and babies are sacrificed and aborted foetuses eatenby the participants. Stewart Swerdlow says that one reason sex is so importantin the rituals is that human semen is considered the most potent booster ofmammalian genetics to hide their reptilian form. This often involves eating thegenitals of the sacrificial victim.16 For certain, Satanic ritual goes on withinthe Mormon Church and, in fact, the number of accounts has forced even theMormon hierarchy to admit it happens. What they deny, of course, is the scale onwhich it happens and that it goes right to the top. Indeed, it is orchestratedfrom there. There are a number of websites exposing this, including a site setup by former Mormons, one of whom is the same bloodline as the Mormon heroBrigham Young.17 The Mormon Church is such a blatant Illuminati front. OrrinHatch, the senator for Utah, has appeared a number of times in my books for hisstatements supporting the Illuminati line. He is the man attacking Internetfreedom and pressing for technology that would destroy computers when peopledownload copyrighted material. This is not the real reason, obviously. The ideaeventually is to destroy the computers of those challenging the Illuminatiagenda. Ironically, Hatch also claims to be an advocate of child protection.Well, if he’s really serious he should start with the Mormon Church. Do youthink he will? Nor me.Rothschild-Bauer-BushThe connection between the hybrid bloodlines and shape-shifting is constantlyconfirmed. Here is one excellent example. The Rothschilds are a predominantreptilian shape-shifting bloodline and they were called Bauer before theychanged their name to Rothschild or “Red Shield”, when their banking dynastybegan in Frankfurt, Germany. The Bauers (also Bower) were an infamous ‘occult’family of Middle Ages Germany. Of course they were; they are from the line of“Sorcerer Kings”. The word “Roth” also developed into Roads, Rhoads, or Rhodes,the name of Cecil Rhodes, the Rothschild placeman who brought devastation andgenocide to southern Africa. The country of Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was namedafter him. On Rhodes’ immense memorial in Cape Town, South Africa, there arelines of lions – a symbol of the serpent cult/Illuminati. Another Reptilianbloodline is the Bush family in the United States, which has provided two of thelast three US Presidents. I stress that I am not saying that everyone calledBauer or Bush throughout the world is like this. I am talking of these AnunnakiReptilian bloodlines that have taken the name Bauer and Bush. I was sent aletter to my website from a source that did not wish his name to be published.It pulls together the names Bauer (Rothschild) and Bush in one story. Before youread it, you need to know that FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency inthe United States, is a major Illuminati operation, as I have explained indetail in other books. It has the power to take control of every aspect ofAmerican life, by law, whenever the President calls a State of Emergency.Anyway, here is a fascinating story connecting FEMA, the Rothschild/Bauer andBush bloodlines, and shape-shifting:> “A few years ago I became acquainted with a lovely person with the surname of> Bauer. We had many varied and wide-ranging discussions. During one of these> talks, the subject of schizophrenia came up. She said it ran in her family.> Asking for more detail, she told me her mother and great aunt had been> afflicted by it. It was the vision hallucination type. The odd thing is that> the hallucinations were incredibly similar. Their ‘hallucinations’ were of> people ‘of royal blood’ turning into giant lizards! > “I was at FEMA training headquarters in Fredricksburg, Maryland, attending a> radiological defense pilot course in 1982 for the Washington State Department> of Emergency Services. During the orientation, Louis Guiffreda, one of the> head honchos and a cousin of [father] George Bush, came in to observe. When he> sat down I noticed a dark haze around him. I kept looking at him to see if my> eyes were playing tricks on me, but it stayed the same. I was up in the seats> alone, as I like to be in these things. Soon, I noticed he was staring at me!> This unnerved me. I closed my eyes and tried to relax. When I opened my eyes> again, I saw him coming toward me. He sat down a few rows behind and to the> left of me. I glanced back and saw him leaning forward with his eyes closed. I> figured he was just tired and decided to take a rest with me. > “While sitting there trying to relax, I heard a strange hissing and swishing> sound come from behind me. I opened my eyes, but was afraid to look around. I> saw a woman in our group looking up in our direction with a look of> astonishment and shock on her face. She kept looking up nervously in our> direction. Eventually, Guiffreda left with his bodyguards (waxy-faced suits> with sunglasses) and the presentation continued. After the orientation, I> walked outside and found this woman sobbing and shaking in the arms of another> participant. I intruded and said I wanted to know why she was looking up with> that look on her face. She didn’t want to say, but with repeated assurance> from me she told me. She had seen Guiffreda ‘turn’ into a lizard! The other> guy said Guiffreda had the nickname of lizard man in the circles around FEMA> and he has a skin disease that makes his skin look like scales. > “I had forgotten about this experience until I read David’s book. It was just> one of those odd things that didn’t make sense. Now it does … I was in quite a> bit of shock when I finally made all the connections. So, what more can I say?> I don’t just believe it’s real, I ‘know’ it is. Unless, of course, I want to> deny my own experience and senses.” 18 Sexual shape-shiftingHere is another example of the way the bloodline names come up in the stories ofshape-shifting. The Oppenheimer family are the controlling bloodline in SouthAfrica on behalf of the Rothschilds and they own the diamond and goldindustries, much of the media and dictate to the government. This is a storysent from a correspondent there:> “I was born in South Africa and years ago got to know an old lady in> Johannesburg who had for many years been the lover of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer,> the founder [with Rothschild backing] of the gold and diamond corporate> cartel. She told me that Sir Ernest used to visit her in the afternoons at her> flat in Parktown. On one occasion as they were about to make love, his body> took on the form and proportions of a giant lizard with scales and she said> the experience had been one of the sexual highlights of her life. The story> which was so strange at the time has been in the back of my mind for years and> came back to me when I recently read your book.” 19 Sexual activity seems to be a time when shape-shifting can happen as thehormones, blood and energy are affected dramatically, and when the excitementcan unlock the mental focus that holds open the ‘human’ DNA codes. This is onereason for the shapeshifting during blood and sacrifice rituals. A businesswomanin Canada told me of her Reptilian experiences. The first was with a Portugueseman who treated her terribly and she was little more than an imprisoned slave.She said he shape-shifted into a reptile. She described how he was stunninglyritualistic, even with the time and day of the month he washed his clothes. Thisis a basic reptilian trait. She later had a relationship with another guy who,she said, was nice on the surface, but had a dark side he was battling with. Shebought The Biggest Secret when it was first published because it exposes ingreat detail the Reptilian phenomenon she had experienced. One time when theywent into her bedroom, the book was lying on a shelf above the bed. The manbecame very wound up and took a serious aversion to it, she told me. When theybegan to have sex, she said he began to go crazy, becoming violent and rough.Amid this anger, he began to shape-shift into a reptile. Her hand was on thebottom of his back while he lay on top of her and she felt her hand being pushedup as the guy began to sprout a tail! She screamed, threw him off, and he beganto “morph” back to human form. She told him to get out of the house immediatelyand, at the time I met her, she had never seen him since.A Los Angeles jazz singer, Pamela Stonebrooke, has written and spoken publiclyabout her sexual encounters with a Reptilian being. When the very tall Reptilianfirst appeared in her bedroom, she says she was terrified. The being forced herto have sex and seemed to get “high” on her fear, but she says that as theseencounters continued she conquered her fear and started coming on to him! Whenher fear subsided, the Reptilian did not seem to be so keen anymore. Pamelaconsiders her Reptilian experience positive overall and talks of a closeconnection with the being. But reports of women being raped by Reptilians arefar from rare. I met Pamela briefly at a conference in Los Angeles and she isquite a character, very strong willed, and that’s just what you need in thesecircumstances. She wrote an open letter to the ‘UFO community’ (most of whom aredepressingly closed-minded to seeing beyond their own ‘official line’):> “Reptilians are not a politically correct species in the UFO community, and to> admit to having sex with one – much less enjoying it – is beyond the pale as> far as the more conservative members of that community are concerned. But I> know from my extensive reading and research, and from talking personally to> dozens of other women (and men), that I am not unique in reporting this kind> of experience. I am the first to admit that this is a vastly complex subject,> a kind of hall of mirrors, where dimensional realities are constantly shifting> and changing. Certainly, the Reptilians use sex to control people in various> ways. > “They have the ability to shape-shift and to control the mind of the> experiencer, as well as to give tremendous pleasure through their mental> powers. I have wrestled with all of these implications and the various levels> of meaning and possibilities represented by my encounter experiences. I will> say, however, as I have said before, that I feel a deep respect for the> reptilian entity with whom I interacted, and a profound connection with this> being.” 20 I would stress here that not all Reptilian entities are of ill intent. There aremany – those who have developed emotionally – who are not trying to manipulatehumanity and would like to help to remove the control of the others. PamelaStonebrooke says that since she began to talk publicly of her experiences, shehas been contacted by hundreds of people telling her of similar encounters withReptilian entities. Credo Mutwa tells of the scores of African women he has metwho have reported the same experience of being forced to have sex with aReptilian or have been artificially impregnated during abduction experiencesonly for the resulting pregnancy to end suddenly when the foetus “disappeared”with no explanation. Most women stay silent because of the obvious publicridicule that would follow and whatever people may think about PamelaStonebrooke, she has the very “couldn’t-give-a-shit” attitude that is vital tomaking suppressed information known to the wider public. In fact, here we have agolden example of the way humanity polices itself and, in doing so, suppressesthe very information that would give us a fix on what is really going on. Whenyou say anything that is different to the norm, the masses either ridicule orcondemn you without doing any research whatsoever to establish if what you saycould be valid. They dismiss it and often direct their bile at the messenger forno other reason than it is different to what they have been programmed tobelieve. Most people when faced with the truth, or a more accurate version ofevents, just laugh in its face or condemn it as evil. Even those who have openedup to some aspects of the truth still can’t expand their mind to encompass theexploding evidence of the Reptilian dimension. One writer, in an otherwise veryinteresting book about ancient extraterrestrials, acknowledges all the serpentsymbolism, names and references surrounding the Anunnaki, but suggests that thiscould have been because they wore reptile clothing or kept snakes. I think therecould be another reason, myself!Reptilian undergroundThere are endless reports of seeing Reptilians and shape-shifting, but mostpeople have no knowledge of this because 99% of the population get their ‘news’and ‘information’ from the mainstream media. Journalists, in turn, get their‘news’ and ‘information’ overwhelmingly from official sources, which, like themedia itself, are owned by the Reptilian bloodlines. After speaking about theReptilians on the excellent Jeff Rense radio show in America, I was sent thisaccount of an experience at the Dulce underground facility in New Mexico. Theseare the words of an army private employed on the surface:> “… I was working on a routine job when another of the young enlistees, a> mechanic, came in with a small rush job he wanted at once.

His> features faded and in their place appeared a ‘thing’ with bulging eyes, no> hair, and scales for skin.” He later saw the same thing happen to a guard at the Dulce front gate andwitnesses have spoken of seeing Reptilian shape-shifters at the Madigan MilitaryHospital near Fort Lewis in Washington State. There are secret undergroundfacilities throughout the world and at the deepest levels they open out into theinner-Earth centres of the Reptilians and associated non-human entities like theso-called “Greys”, who are subordinate to the Reptilians. Area 51 in Nevada isthe best-known underground facility in UFO research circles, but there are manyothers. These facilities are themselves connected by a massive tunnel networkthat has been built with nuclear boring technology that the public never sees.It can cut tunnels at the rate of seven miles a day and these are an expansionof the global tunnel network claimed by legends and accounts to exist under theUnited States, Central and South America, Britain, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Turkey,Asia, China, Malta, pretty much everywhere. The tunnels have state-of-the-arttransport systems that move at astonishing speeds. Insiders describe them as“magneto-leviton or mag-lev monorail trains capable of mach-2”. LeadingIlluminati companies and operations are involved in the construction andadministration. Companies like the Rand Corporation, General Electric, AT & T,Hughes Aircraft, Northrop Corporation, Sandia Corporation, Stanford ResearchInstitute, Walsh Construction, the Colorado School of Mines, and the mostsignificant one of all, Bechtel, the major Illuminati corporation that has won amassive contract to ‘rebuild’ Iraq after it was bombed by the ‘liberators’.Workers who experienced the deeper levels of the Dulce base saw scenes soterrifying they have refused to talk about them. From other sources, however, wecan imagine some of what they saw. These bases are where many of the millions,yes millions, of children who go missing every year worldwide are taken. I knowit is hard to stomach, but they are used for slave labour and eaten by theReptilians, just like humans eat chickens or cows. Workers at Dulce havereported seeing the most grotesque sights in the lower levels. Researchers BillHamilton and TAL Levesque (also known as Jason Bishop III) gathered thefollowing information about Dulce, which they published in UFO Magazine:> “Level number six is privately called ‘Nightmare Hall’. It holds the genetic> labs. Reports from workers who have seen bizarre experimentation are as> follows: ‘I have seen multi-legged ‘humans’ that look like half-human/half> octopus. Also reptilian-humans and furry creatures that have hands like humans> and cry like a baby. It mimics human words … also a huge mixture of> lizard-humans in cages. There are fish, seals, birds and mice that can hardly> be considered those species. There are several cages (and vats) of winged> humanoids, grotesque bat-like creatures … but three and a half to seven feet> tall. Gargoyle-like beings and Draco reptoids. > “Level number seven is worse, row after row of thousands of humans and human> mixtures in cold storage. Here, too, are embryo storage vats of humanoids in> various stages of development. [One worker said] ‘…I frequently encountered> humans in cages, usually dazed or drugged, but sometimes they cried and begged> for help. We were told they were hopelessly insane, and involved in high-risk> drug tests to cure insanity. We were told never to try to speak to them at> all. At the beginning we believed that story. Finally, in 1978, a small group> of workers discovered the truth’ …” 21 A security officer at Dulce called Thomas Castello has described to researcherswhat happens at the Dulce base and his words were reported in the UFO Magazinearticle. His information has also been circulated as the “Dulce Papers”.Castello worked for seven years with the Rand Corporation, an Illuminatioperation in Santa Monica, California, connected to the ‘neo-cons’ running the‘war on terrorism’, and he was transferred to Dulce in 1977. He estimated therewere more than 18,000 of the “short Greys” at Dulce and he had also seen tallReptilian humanoids. He knew of seven levels, but there could have been more,and he said the ‘aliens’ were on levels five, six and seven. The lower you go,the higher the security clearance you need. The only sign in English was abovethe tube shuttle station which said “to Los Alamos”, another major undergroundReptilian base in New Mexico, where the H- bombs were developed that weredropped on Japan. Most signs at Dulce are in the “alien symbol language” and auniversal symbol system understood by humans and aliens, he said. The Illuminaticommunicate above ground in the language of symbolism, as I have detailed inother books. The hieroglyphics of Sumer, Egypt and China, would have been aReptilian or ‘alien’ language originally. Other tunnel connections from Dulcewent to underground facilities at Page, Arizona; Area 51 in Nevada; Taos,Carlsbad and Datil, New Mexico; and Colorado Springs and Creede, Colorado.Castello said there was a network of tube shuttle connections under the UnitedStates, which extends into a global system of tunnels and sub-cities.He described the immense security at Dulce. Below the second level, everyone isweighed naked and given a uniform. Any change in weight is noted and people areexamined and X-rayed if there is a change of three pounds. At the entrance toall ‘sensitive’ areas there are scales and a person’s weight must match withtheir card and code to gain entry. Castello also revealed some of the geneticwork carried out at Dulce. He said that their scientists can separate the“bioplasmic body” from the physical body and place an “alien entity” within ahuman body after removing the “soul” of the human. I have thought for years thatsome famous people, including prime ministers and presidents, were taken intosuch facilities and possessed by a Reptilian entity. To the public the famousperson looks the same physically afterwards, but now a very different force isdeciding the behaviour. Ancient legends also tell of people being replaced inthe night by “changelings” or shape-shifters. The Illuminati hybrid bloodlineswith their higher ratio of Reptilian DNA makes this possession easier and thisis why the Illuminati keep such detailed genetic records of family bloodlines.The joint global press announcement by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in 2000 aboutthe mapping of the human genome takes on even greater significance when youthink that the US Department of Energy has laboratories at Dulce and is closelyconnected to the genome project, along with the National Institute of Health,the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. All areIlluminati fronts. Researcher Alan Walton writes extensively on the Internetabout the Reptilian connection under the pseudonym, “Branton”. He says:> “Underneath most major cities, especially in the USA in fact, there exist> subterranean counterpart ‘cities’ controlled by the Masonic/hybrid/alien> ‘elite’. Often surface/ subsurface terminals exist beneath Masonic Lodges,> police stations, airports and federal buildings of major cities … and even not> so ‘major’ cities. The population ratio is probably close to 10% of the> population (the hybrid military-industrial fraternity ‘elite’ living below> ground as opposed to the 90% living above). This does not include the> full-blood reptilian species who live in even deeper recesses of the Earth. > “Some of the major population centers were deliberately established by the> Masonic/hybrid elite of the Old and New ‘worlds’ to afford easy access to> already existing underground levels, some of which are thousands of years old.> Considering that the Los Alamos Labs [in New Mexico] had a working prototype> nuclear powered thermol-bore drill that could literally melt tunnels through> the earth at a rate of 8 mph 40 years ago, you can imagine how extensive these> underground systems have become.

I have twice driven around the outside of thebase. On one side the public road runs alongside the perimeter fence for awhile. The entrance to China Lake is in the little town of Ridgecrest and thisis where “D” once lived. Ridgecrest is home to many mind-controlled slavesprogrammed at China Lake and it’s not far from where the mass murderer CharlesManson and his “Family” used to live. “D” said she was chosen by the militaryfor mind-control because of her bloodline. They had told her that before thedevelopment of language, humans communicated by telepathy thanks to a hormonesecreted in the brain. This hormone, she was told, was no longer operating inmost people, only in particular bloodlines, including hers, and they wanted touse these abilities. The period thousands of years ago when this telepathichuman brain function was genetically suppressed was symbolised by the storycommon to most ancient cultures of the gods giving people different languages todivide them and stop them communicating. The universal language was telepathyand this was replaced by words. The use of telepathy maintained humansensitivity to other levels of consciousness while words hold people in thefive-senses because they are a five-sense activity. That was the idea.“D” said she was taken underground at China Lake and saw the genetics laboratoryand holding centre for captured humans and genetically engineered mutants. Shedescribed seeing horrendous creatures of all types, shapes and sizes at ChinaLake. She said she was shown these horrors to let her see what would happen toher if she did not cooperate and she claimed her own son had been murdered.Under China Lake, she said, a Reptilian sexually assaulted her and she sawanother cut open the chest of a “Grey”. “D” said that from her experience theGreys are terrified of the Reptilian leadership and do whatever they tell them.On another occasion, she said, she was taken to the Reptilian base under theappropriately named Death Valley, a relatively short drive from China Lake.There she said she saw a Reptilian leader, much taller than the others, who waswearing an Egyptian headdress with a cobra snake motif.Ancient and modernThe stories of Reptilians and other non-human races living within the Earth inwhat we would today call “bases”, cities, or tunnel networks, can be foundwidely described in ancient accounts. The Nagas, or serpent people, in India andthroughout Asia and the Far East, were said to live in two main undergroundcentres called Patala and Bhogavati. From there, according to Hindu legend, theybattle for power with a ‘white’ race known by UFO researchers as the ‘Nordics’(including the ‘Lyrians’) and located in the underground kingdoms of Agharta andShambala. Tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed “extraterrestrials” are often reportedby those claiming to have been abducted by “ETs”. Hindus believe that Patala canbe entered at the Well of Sheshna in Benares, while Bhogavati is believed to bein the Himalayas. Similar stories of underground caverns and tunnel systems canbe found in Tibet and China. In the Gilgamesh stories of the Sumerian Tablets,we are told of underground cities. Gilgamesh was a “demi-god” and “semi-divine”(Reptilian hybrid) who sought the immortality of the ‘gods’. The stories speakof KI-GAL or “the Great Below”, which was ruled by the goddess Ereshkigal andthe god Mergal. In the KI-GAL were violent guardians called “scorpion men”,reanimated human bodies, spirits and the “undead”, and robotic beings known asGalatur or Gala, which were used to abduct humans from the surface. There were“eagle-headed” Reptilians, which were often said to have wings. The accountsdescribe a race called the Pazazu, a dog-faced ‘human’ with reptilian scales andtail. All this sounds remarkably like the scenes described at Dulce today.Chinese legend claims there is an underground world entered from the EasternMountain of Taishan and it is guarded by vicious demons called Men Shen withanimal-like faces or masks. This was the Chinese ‘Hell’ and it is said that theLords of Hell interacted with the Dragon Kings on the surface. The Japanese‘Hell’ or underground network was similar, and among the non-human entities werethe Kappa, semi-aquatic reptilian humanoids and other shape-shifters who livedin mountains, under the ground or under the sea. In Viking-Norse legend theyhave the giant serpent, Nidhoggr or Jormungand, that lived underground and thiswas similar to the giant serpent Apophis in Egyptian myth. The Scandinavians andGermans had their Huldre or “Hidden Folk” who were also known as the elves. Oneof the codes for the bloodline is “elven” and the beings of folklore liketrolls, etins, fairies, elves, troglodytes, Nefilim, Brownies or Braunies andthe “little people” of Ireland are all different names for the subterraneanentities described in the modern accounts of ‘ET bases’.24All the same stories are associated with them – interbreeding with humans,unable to go out in the sunlight (like ‘Dracula’), and all the rest. They evenmention the ‘missing time’ experience of people abducted by the ‘fairies’ (likemodern ‘UFO’ abductees) and include many stories of these underground folkkilling and mutilating cattle and taking the blood. Michael Mott has produced anexcellent collection of these stories on underground dwellers in folklore andmyth in his book.25 He writes that England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all haveendless traditions of underground peoples with many similarities and commonorigins between them. It seems to me that Scotland, Ireland and the BritishIsles in general are such a major centre for the Illuminati bloodlines becauseof the number of entrances to the underground world there are in that region. Itis the same with other parts of the world like France, Germany and our oldfriends, the Caucasus Mountains. What is really under the Windsors’ BalmoralCastle or the Queen Mother’s Glamis Castle in Scotland, that highly significantcountry for Illuminati bloodlines? There is a legendary “secret room” at Glamis.According to a guest, the writer, Sir Walter Scott and others, it is thefamily’s law or custom that the secret is known only to three people at any onetime. They take a “terrible oath” not to reveal the secret. Another guest, LordHalifax, said that in 1875 a workman at the castle came across a door leading toa long passageway. The man investigated, but then he saw something that made himrun back in terror. When the 13th Earl of Strathmore was told what the workmanhad seen he persuaded him to accept money to emigrate and give his word never toreveal what he saw. Lord Halifax said that after the incident the Earl was achanged man, who became silent and moody, with an “anxious, scared face”.The Norse/Germanic fairies, goblins, trows, knockers, brownies, leprechauns,sidhe (shee), tylwyth teg (terlooeth teig) and so on were either malevolent orindifferent to humanity, Michael Mott says. They lived, virtually withoutexception, under the ground. Mounds, hills, ruins, hill-forts, mountains, cliffsand ancient cities were said to be the “rooftops” of their palaces. Beings thatmirror modern reports of the Sasquatch (Big Foot) and the Yeti (AbominableSnowman) can be found in ancient stories of underground creatures that come tothe surface. Like the Nagas, the serpent people of Asia, European folklore oftenclaimed that these “fairy” people entered their underground homes through lakes.Michael Mott continues:> “To remove all doubt as to their relationship with Norse hidden-folk and> Indian Nagas alike, they shunned the sunlight [like Dracula], and often seemed> interested in crossbreeding their own bloodlines with those of human beings,> or even in crossbreeding their ‘livestock’ or fairy cattle, horses, hounds and> so forth with the surface species which were most compatible. The> goblin-dwarf, Rumplestiltskin, in his lust to have the human baby and its> genetic bounty, is just one example of this in folklore. The elves took a> regular interest in human affairs – weddings, births and deaths, (bloodlines),> the success of crops and livestock, and so forth – but only for their own> selfish interests. They seemed to be overly-concerned with genetic and> biological diversity, and they pilfered livestock, crops and human genes via> theft or cross-species liaison whenever they saw fit to do so. The elves are> generally depicted as extremely fair-haired and fair-skinned.” 26 The accounts even include the idea of being imprisoned underground waiting forthe day of judgement. Michael Mott summarises the common attributes of theinner-Earth peoples of global folklore:> “They are mostly reptilian or reptilian humanoids or ‘fair’ and Nordic; they> are telepathic with superior mental powers; they can shape-shift and create> illusions; they want to interbreed with humans and need human blood, flesh and> reproductive materials; they have advanced technology; they have the secret of> immortality; they can fly, either by themselves or with their technology; they> mostly have a malevolent agenda for humans; they cannot survive for long in> direct sunlight; they have been banished from the surface world or are in> hiding from surface people and/or the Sun; they want to keep their treasures,> knowledge and true identity a secret; they covertly manipulate events on the> surface world; they have surface humans working for them through the> priesthoods, cults and secret societies; they have a putrid smell like> ‘sulphur and brimstone’.” 27 The accounts are incredibly consistent over thousands of years. Mott writes:> “The reptilian aspect of some underworlders permeates folklore. One universal> theme that recurs in the folktales of many, many cultures is that of the> snake-husband or snake-wife, who can transform into a ‘human’ or humanoid form> and is invariably (of course) of royal blood among his or her own kind (talk> about the ultimate pick-up line!). Often the snake or serpent-man exacts a> promise of marriage, or the hand of an unborn human child in betrothal,> consistent with the theme of the subterranean’s interest in maintaining their> own genetic diversity. > “A variant of this should be familiar to most readers of fairy tales, in the> form of ‘The Frog Prince’. The frog-prince is a Handsome Prince, but like the> Japanese seducing dragon, he has a reptilian or amphibian form. The underworld> link is complete, for frequently the frog lives in a deep well, from which he> is discovered or rescued by the female protagonist. A possible connection is> evident in the Scandinavian belief that some dwarves would ‘turn into toads”,> if caught by the Sun, much like Mimoto’s lover turned from a man into a> ‘dragon’ when the same thing happened. Slovenia has its legends of fairies and> ‘little people’, but Slovenian fairy tales are also permeated by the presence> of the ‘Snake Queen’, a great, white, cave-dwelling creature who is part woman> and part serpent. The serpentine-yet-human Nagas are still believed by devout> Hindus and some Buddhists to dwell beneath India, Nepal and Tibet.” 28 The ancient and modern interconnecting accounts are overwhelming when you putthem together. I have summarised here only a fraction of what has come to lightin my research. You will find far more about the Reptilians in The BiggestSecret, Children of the Matrix and the Credo Mutwa DVD set, The ReptilianAgenda. By the late 1990s, one thing was clear. The difference between the worldwe live in and the one we are told we live in, was of a magnitude that almostdefied belief.SOURCES > 1 Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips: Trance-Formation of America (Reality> Marketing Inc., Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, 1995)> 2 Trance-Formation of America, pp 209 to 210> 3 Colonel James Churchward, The Lost Continent of Mu (Brotherhood of Life> Inc., USA 1994 edition, first published in 1926).

But I beganto realise that the conspiracy was not only a phenomenon of the ‘five-sense’level of reality. It was also inter-dimensional.As I have already outlined, there are many levels of vibrational reality sharingthe same space, just as radio and television frequencies do. Broadcastfrequencies only interfere or become aware of each other when they are reallyclose on the dial and the same principle applies to the realities and dimensionsof existence that are sharing the same space that we are now occupying. Whenpeople say that infinity is within you or, symbolically, the Kingdom of Heavenis within you, they are correct. All infinity is within us because all ofinfinity shares all space. The point is, however, that we cannot see all ofinfinity with our five-senses, as you cannot hear all the radio stationsavailable by tuning to one of them. My research led me to the understanding thatwhile ‘five-sense’ non-human entities exist on this planet, the real focus ofthe global manipulation was with reptilian and other non-human entitiesoperating from frequencies a fraction outside the frequency range accessible byhuman sight. From there they ‘possessed’ the ‘human’ bodies of the Illuminatibloodlines and used them as a vehicle to dictate events in our reality behindthe veil of an apparently human form.Our five-senses can perceive only the denser vibrational fields that reflectlight. As the vibration increases, it eventually reaches a point where we can nolonger see it because it has gone beyond the frequency range of the five-senses.At this stage, to our five-sense reality, it ‘disappears’. It has done no suchthing; it has merely left the frequency range of our five-senses. It hasn’t‘disappeared’ any more than Radio 1 ‘disappears’ when you retune to Radio 2. Thefive-sense range is so limited that we cannot perceive most of what exists inthis universe alone. According to the latest research, some 99.5% of the mass inthe universe is lost to the five-senses. We can only see matter that reflectslight, what science calls ‘luminous matter’. This is why, when you are incomplete darkness, you can’t see anything. Only when you introduce light toreflect from the objects around you can they be seen. Some 99.5% of mass in thisuniverse is called ‘dark matter’ because it does not reflect light and we can’tsee it. A friend of mine, Giuliana Conforto, an Italian who trained as aphysicist, explains all this in simple terms in her superb books, Man’s CosmicGame and Giordano Bruno’s Future Science.1 We have people making definitejudgements and proclaiming certainties about the nature of life and creationwhen we can’t even see 99.5% of our own universe!The official scientific explanations of life are blatantly absurd and when itcomes to the big questions, the contradictions and anomalies, they have nowhereto go unless they change their foundation beliefs and misconceptions. This isnow being forced upon establishment science by quantum physics which isdemolishing all the long held ‘certainties’ about reality. An edition of the BBCscience series Horizon in 2002 was devoted to the gathering acceptance amongscientists of the existence of parallel universes or parallel realities, as Iprefer to call them. The opening narrative to the programme said:> “For almost a hundred years science has been haunted by a dark secret, that> there might be mysterious, hidden worlds beyond our human senses. Mystics have> long claimed there were such places. They were, they said, full of ghosts and> spirits – but ever since the 19th century physicists have been trying to make> sense of an uncomfortable discovery. When they tried to pin point the exact> location of atomic particles like electrons, they found it was utterly> impossible. They had no single location. The only explanation that anyone> could come up with is that the particles don’t just exist in our universe.> They slip into existence in other universes, too, and there are an infinite> number of these parallel universes, all of them slightly different. In effect,> there’s a parallel universe in which Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo; in> another the British Empire held on to its American colonies; in one you were> never born. They are even stranger than Elvis being alive.” Different era, same manipulatorsAppreciating the existence of these other realities is essential tounderstanding the way our ‘world’ is manipulated. It answers the question of whypeople would dedicate their lives to a plan for global domination when they knowthey will be dead long before the goal was reached. What if the entitiescontrolling the ‘bodies’, the mental and emotional responses of those in powerthrough the centuries, have largely been the same ones all along? What if theyoperate just beyond the frequency range of the five-senses and use apparently‘human’ physical bodies to manipulate the five-sense world and when one bodygives up on them at ‘death’ they move into another and continue themanipulation, the long-term agenda, for another period of what we call ‘time’?Cathy O’Brien recalls in Trance-Formation of America her experience with Billand Bob Bennett, two well-known figures in US politics. Bill Bennett controlledAmerican ‘education’ during the Reagan-Bush administration and is closelyconnected to the ‘neo-cons’ behind the Project for the New American Century andthe American Enterprise Institute. Cathy says the Bennetts gave hermind-altering drugs at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center mind-controllaboratory. They told her they were “alien to this dimension – two beings fromanother plane”. Cathy continues:> “The high-tech light display around me convinced me I was transforming> dimensions with them. A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me,> which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party> – as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them. Not> recognising anyone, I frantically asked: ‘Who are these people?’ > “‘They’re not people and this isn’t a spaceship’, [Bill] Bennett said. As he> spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people> appeared to be lizard-like aliens. > “‘Welcome to the second level of the underground. This is a mere mirror> reflection of the first, an alien dimension. We are from a trans-dimensional> plane that spans and encompasses all dimensions…’ I have taken you through my> dimension as a means of establishing stronger holds on your mind than the> Earth plane permits’ Bill Bennett was saying. ‘Being alien, I simply make my> thoughts your thoughts by projecting them into your mind. My thoughts are your> thoughts …’” 2 ‘Heaven’ between heavensThought transfer is another way that people are controlled and manipulated. TheReptilian mind becomes the human mind and you can see this happening all thetime as the Reptilian ‘hive’ mind becomes the human ‘hive’ mentality. Betweendimensions, in this case between the third dimension (the five-senses) and thenext one, the fourth dimension, are little ‘crevices’ of frequency, almost likeneutral zones. The Italian physicist Giuliana Conforto calls them “inter-spaceplanes” and they lie between the dimensions or, as the scientists called them inthe Horizon programme, parallel universes. It is in the inter-space plane,Giuliana suggested to me, that the Reptilians and other entities reside. This isthe realm of the “demons” of folklore that have been frightening andmanipulating humans for as long as ancient accounts record. I rang Credo Mutwa,the Zulu Sanusi (shaman) and official historian of the Zulu nation, to ask himif these ‘inter-space planes’ were part of his understanding. “Oh yes”, he said.“We call them the heaven between heavens and that’s where the reptiles are.” Infrequency terms, the inter-space plane is very close to the range of thefive-senses, but a fraction outside, just beyond the range that we can see.However, if someone with psychic sight can extend their vibrational range alittle they can connect with that frequency range and see some of these entities– and they do. People who have taken mind-altering drugs that break through thevibrational walls of the five-senses and allow their consciousness to see beyondit have had the same experience. Also, if these entities lower their vibrationonly slightly to enter the five-sense range they become visible to us here. Asthe Horizon science programme about parallel universes said:> “The only explanation that anyone could come up with is that the particles> don’t just exist in our universe. They slip into existence in other universes,> too, and there are an infinite number of these parallel universes, all of them> slightly different.” It is possible for particles to move between ‘universes’ or ‘realities’ and‘dimensions’ and so it is possible for entities to do the same. This is a majorreason why the Illuminati bloodlines have taken part in their rituals fromancient times to the present day. The rituals allow them to connect with theirmasters in the inter-space planes, not least because human blood and thevibrational fields created by the rituals produce the frequency environment inwhich the Reptilians and other entities can manifest in the five-sense frequencyrange. Credo Mutwa has described to me how he witnessed rituals decades ago atwhich people in the room shifted from a human to a reptilian form, but therehave been countless other people from very different cultures and backgroundswho have described the same experience of what happens once the blood begins toflow.The emerald tabletsAncient tablets, alleged to come from beneath a Mayan temple in Mexico, describethe Reptilians, their ability to shape-shift, and how they possess the bodies ofpeople in power. The accounts correlate remarkably with modern experience andreports. They are known as the Emerald Tablets of Thoth, who was a deity of theEgyptians. It is claimed that they date back 36,000 years and were written byThoth, an “Atlantean Priest-King” who, it is said, founded a colony in Egypt.His tablets, the story goes, were taken to South America by Egyptian “pyramidpriests” and eventually placed under a Mayan temple to the Sun God in theYucatan, Mexico. The translator of these tablets, Maurice Doreal, claims to haverecovered them and completed the translations in 1925. But only much later washe given “permission” for part of them to be published, he says. You can readthe whole tale and the content of the tablets on this website:http://crystalinks.com/emerald.html [http://crystalinks.com/emerald.html]. Thereis also a book.3 However, you don’t have to accept all the details of that storyto appreciate the synchronicity between what these tablets say and what is nowbeing uncovered. The tablets tell of the “children of the shadows” manipulatingthis reality:> “Speak I of ancient Atlantis, speak of the days of the Kingdom of Shadows,> speak of the coming of the children of shadows. Out of the great deep were> they called by the wisdom of earth-man, called for the purpose of gaining> great power. > “Far in the past before Atlantis existed, men there were who delved into> darkness, using dark magic, calling up beings from the great deep below us.> Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration,> existing unseen by the children of earth-men. Only through blood could they> form being, only through man could they live in the world. > “In ages past were they conquered by the Masters, driven below to the place> whence they came. But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces and> planes unknown to man. Live they in Atlantis as shadows, but at times they> appeared among men. Aye, when the blood was offered, forth came they to dwell> among men. > “In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as are> men. Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted, but appearing to man as men> among men. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men.> Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling> o’er man. Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their> faces be seen. Sought they from the kingdom of shadows, to destroy man and> rule in his place. > “But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil from> the face of the serpent, able to send him back to his place. Came they to man> and taught him the secret, the Word that only a man can pronounce; swift then> they lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from place among men. > “Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open, at times, to> the world. Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have been> said; again as time passes onward, shall they take the semblance of men. > “Called, may they be, by the master who knows the white or the black, but only> the white master may control and bind them while in the flesh. > “Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only the> master of brightness shall conquer the shadow of fear. > “Know ye, O my brother, that fear is an obstacle great; be master of all in> the brightness, the shadow will soon disappear. Hear ye, and heed my wisdom,> the voice of LIGHT is clear, seek the valley of shadow and light only will> appear.” Within that passage, whatever its origin may be, you have the story of life onEarth and the source of those who control the world today. The leadingpoliticians, banking and business leaders, media owners and heads of themilitary are the “serpent-headed beings” hidden behind human form (or theirpuppets and stooges). They are the ones the Sumerian Tablets called the Anunnakiand the “sons of the gods” that the Bible calls the Nefilim. The backgroundpresented in the Emerald Tablets is confirmed by modern experience andinformation from the inside of the Illuminati. Here are some examples of what Imean:> “Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration,> existing unseen by the children of earth-men.” This is describing how the Reptilians and other non-human entities exist in thesame space as we do, but in another “cycle” or frequency that we cannot normallyperceive. To operate and manipulate our reality they needed a five-sense humanform. They had to create a ‘genetic space suit’ that they could occupy and hidewithin. Cathy O’Brien says in her book, Trance-Formation of America, thatPresident de la Madrid of Mexico told her this was achieved by creatingbloodlines that fused their reptilian DNA with that of humans. These bloodlineshave a genetic, therefore vibrational, compatibility between the Reptilians andtheir five-sense ‘human’ forms. This makes the possession or take-over of thesebodies far easier and more effective than with other human genetic streams thatdo not have that particular DNA combination. It is to retain this geneticstructure that the Illuminati bloodlines have always interbred with each otherand continue to do so. It means that if they can manipulate these bloodlinesinto the positions of power, they are putting themselves into those positionsthrough their control of these bodies from their own frequency. This is thereason that the genealogy of those in the major seats of global power today canbe traced back to the royal lines – the Reptilian hybrids – that ruled Sumer,Babylon, Egypt and so on. The ancient Book of Enoch says that those born ofNefilim blood are, because of their “ancestral spirit” (Reptilian possession),destined to “afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle and work destructionon the Earth”. The Nefilim are associated with human sacrifice and blooddrinking – just like the Illuminati today. The Book of Enoch describes thebehaviour of the Nefilim offspring produced with human women:> “And they became pregnant, and bore great giants … who consumed all the> acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants> turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds> and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another’s flesh and> drink blood. The Earth laid accusation against the lawless ones.” That continues to be the mentality of those who manipulate events. SharonJacobs, who took part in many blood and sacrifice rituals under the mind-controlof the Mormon Church, told me how Reptilians and other entities would possessthe men impregnating women in the rituals. In doing so they would implant afrequency code in the DNA of the offspring that would connect them vibrationallyto these inter-space plane entities.The vampiresThe Emerald Tablets also say:> “Only through blood could they form being, only through man could they live in> the world.” Insiders have told me that Reptilians need to drink human (mammalian) blood tomaintain human form and stop their reptilian vibrational codes from manifestingtheir true reptilian state. Accounts of the Nefilim also include references totheir blood-drinking activities, as we have seen. All this explains why thesebloodlines have always taken part in human sacrifice and blood drinking ritualsfrom the ancient world to the present day. This includes people of the bloodlinelike the Bushes, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, the Rockefellers,Rothschilds, British prime ministers like Tony Blair and Ted Heath, and theBritish royal family. I have been writing for years about the ancient Satanicrituals performed by the elite of the United States at a place called BohemianGrove. This is 2,700 acres of secluded and guarded redwood forest in NorthernCalifornia. Cathy O’Brien tells in her book, Trance-Formation of America, of howshe and her fellow mind-slaves were forced to serve the perversions of theirabusers at Bohemian Grove. These include Satanic rituals, child sacrifices,torture and blood drinking. Cathy says: “Slaves of advancing age or with failedprogramming were ritually murdered at random in the wooded grounds of the Groveand I felt it was only a matter of time before it would be me”.4 She says thatthe Grove has a number of rooms for different perversions, including a DarkRoom, a Leather Room, a Necrophilia Room and one known as the UndergroundLounge, spelt as U.N.derground on the sign.Image [../Images/00045.jpg]Figure: 40: The 40 foot stone owl alongside the sacrificial fire at BohemianGrove in Northern California during the summer camp of the Illuminati. The‘elite’ of America, including President Bush, attend these Babylonian ritualsthat have been performed by the bloodlines since ancient times In Figure 40, there is a photograph of robed and hooded men at the Grovestanding alongside a large fire while worshipping a 40-foot stone owl – anancient Illuminati symbol going back to Babylon and beyond (Figure 41). Theseworld-famous Illuminati initiates at Bohemian Grove burn and sacrifice a human‘effigy’ under the owl at the start of their ‘summer camp’ every year. Thishappens during a Babylonian-type ritual called the Cremation of Care and in theyear 2000 Alex Jones, an American radio talk show host, took a hidden camerainto the Grove and filmed the ritual. He was too far away to see if thesacrifice was an ‘effigy’ or real, but the human sacrifice rituals go on amongthe elite of the elite in much more secret and secluded locations during the‘camp’, according to insiders. The Jones footage clearly shows the bizarreopening ritual and the sound quality is particularly good. At one point an‘effigy’ is floated on a boat across the lake at Bohemian Grove where it isplaced under the giant owl and set on fire. At this point you hear very clearlya blood-curdling scream and one of two things are happening. They are eithersacrificing a human being in the guise of an “effigy” or they broadcast thesound of the scream of agony as part of the ceremony. Whichever, this is thementality behind the Fourth Reich, just as it was with the Third. PresidentGeorge W. Bush, like his father and grandfather, is a Bohemian Grove attendeeand arrived there shortly after the video was shot. The Jones footage appearedin a television documentary on the UK’s Channel 4 in 2001, a programme thatskimmed the surface of what really goes on at the Grove and missed a wonderfulopportunity. Alex Jones’s own video of the Grove footage is far better than theUK Channel 4 version and is available through www.Infowars.com[http://www.Infowars.com].Image [../Images/00046.jpg]Figure 41: An original Babylonian terracotta relief depicting Ishtar (QueenSemiramis), the goddess of Babylon, alongside her owls. This is one reason whythe owl is an Illuminati symbol Among the participants at Bohemian Grove past and present are George Bush;George W. Bush; Al Gore; Ronald Reagan; Richard Nixon; Jimmy Carter; GeraldFord; Dwight D. Eisenhower; Lyndon Johnson; Herbert Hoover; Teddy Roosevelt; DanQuayle; Robert Kennedy (JFK’s brother); Joseph Kennedy (JFK’s father); EarlWarren (head of the Warren Commission, which ‘investigated’ JFK’s murder); DavidRockefeller; Laurance Rockefeller; Nelson Rockefeller; Henry Kissinger; MikhailGorbachev (the Soviet Union and the ‘West’ were always controlled by the sameforce); William F. Buckley, an American publisher and major Illuminatioperative; George Shultz, the former Secretary of State to Reagan-Bush, advisorto the ‘election’ campaign of boy Bush and leading light in Bechtul, the companywith the massive contracts to ‘rebuild’ Iraq; Walter Cronkite, America’s mostfamous news reader; William Randolph Hearst, the American newspaper tycoon;Andrew Knight, a British media executive closely connected to the Rupert MurdochEmpire; Edward Teller (‘Father of the H bomb’); Glenn Seaborg, who developedplutonium; Burt Bacharach, the composer; singer Bing Crosby; Bob Hope, a BritishMI6 operative and handler of mind-controlled ‘multiples’; Ray Kroc, the manbehind the McDonald’s fast-food empire; author Mark Twain; and John Muir,founder of the Illuminati environmental front, the Sierra Club.5 That’s just afew of them. The Kennedys are a major bloodline family in the States, buteveryone is expendable if the Illuminati agenda requires action to be taken.Many recovering mind-controlled slaves have told me how they were brutallysexually abused by Senator Edward Kennedy and one former mind-controlledoperative with the Illuminati, a mind-controller herself, told me: “Senator[Edward] Kennedy and the whole Kennedy family was part of this. I know that theyare political icons in our country, but they are in it up to their eyeballs”.Phillip Eugene de Rothschild says he is one of hundreds of thousands ofunofficial Rothschild offspring. He stresses that often the most significantoperatives in the Illuminati hide behind apparently ‘ordinary’ lives whiledictating the agenda and attending human sacrifice rituals. This is my owninformation, too, after talking to Illuminati insiders. But he says that thereare many public figures that are very high in the Illuminati-Satanic pyramid andhe highlights Prince Philip as a major player in the rituals he has attended:> “I can recall the Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals, but never> having the supremacy to lead them. I still regard them as lackeys and not real> brokers of occult power. Except for Alan Greenspan [head of the US Federal> Reserve Bank], most of these fellows were camp followers in the occult,> primarily for the economic power and prestige. Greenspan, I recall, was a> person of tremendous spiritual, occult power and could make the Bushes and the> younger Rockefellers cower with just a glance. Ex-CIA Director Casey (as were> most of the CIA leadership for the past forty years), Kissinger, and Warren> Christopher [former US Secretary of State] were in attendance at non-ritual> gatherings and some occult rituals as well, but well back in the gallery. > “At the forefront of the rituals were [the royal families of Europe], Prince> Philip at the pinnacle. He stands, like most of the contemporary European> monarchy, in the Charlemagne, Merovingian, Aenean bloodline. But he is its> current head. I am certain that his maternal chromosomes are in the current> “antichrist” Nephilim. Prince Philip … is the leading biological descendent of> the ‘Reptilians’, as you call them. Immediately below him are the males of my> family line [Rothschilds] like a court of ministers in charge of logistics and> operations. The current monarchs of The Netherlands, Spain, and some of the> old Austrian nobility [Habsburgs] are next in occult power and in the> conspiracy.” 6 There is a lot of detailed background to Prince Philip and the Windsors in TheBiggest Secret. Other information has come from the victims of the Illuminatimind-control programmes, like Stewart Swerdlow, who was held at Montauk Point onLong Island, New York, which has been the subject of a number of publications.Stewart tells how he witnessed human sacrifice ceremonies at Montauk involvingWilliam F. Buckley, the well-known American publisher and Bohemian Grove member,who, I was told by Arizona Wilder, heads the elite Janus mind-control operationbased at NATO headquarters in Belgium. Arizona says she has had similarexperiences with Buckley. Swerdlow writes in his book, Blue Blood, True Bloodthat during his time in captivity at Montauk he often saw other apparentlyfamous people at the rituals:> “… Many well-known personalities came to participate. Some of these were> political figures, while others were in the media or literary world. I> remember seeing personages that looked like Sir Laurence Gardner, William F.> Buckley, Sean Connery, Spiro Agnew, Henry Kissinger, John F. Kennedy, Jr., the> Shah of Iran, and numerous other actors, military personnel, and Middle> Eastern figures, whose names I did not know. All, but Kennedy and Connery> shape-shifted into Reptilian form during the ceremonies. > “On most occasions they gorge on fetuses harvested from abortion clinics. They> also had live babies that they held up by the back of the neck. Then, they> slashed its throat from left to right, ear to ear, biting down on the gaping> opening to drink the blood. This was an amazing delicacy to them.” 7 Telling tailsSwerdlow says that the knowledge he learned at Montauk showed him how theReptilians shape-shift. He said there are locked sequences and open sequences ofDNA. Open codes manifest as a physical characteristic while closed codes do not.The Reptilian hybrids, he says, have the ability to lock off certain geneticcodings while they open others. When this happens, he says, there is a literaltransformation of the cellular structure, which changes from a mammalian to areptilian form. “So it’s not like the human form goes anywhere”, he told me, “Itjust shifts, it changes into a reptilian form because those sequences areopened. They also have the ability to shift it back”. However much your mind maybe struggling to cope with that, for sure what he says about DNA codes ingeneral is correct. Some babies are still being born with tails because codesfrom our reptilian past have opened in those people when they should haveremained closed and dormant. These tails are known today as caudal appendagesand doctors usually remove them immediately. But in those areas of the worldwhere that treatment is not available, people live their whole life with a tail.You only have to feel the bottom of your spine to see where our tails used to beand they do not manifest today, except rarely, purely because the DNA geneticblueprint is closed. Swerdlow is merely claiming that when you know what you aredoing and understand DNA to a much greater level than human scientists currentlydo, you can make this code-opening and closing happen real fast. As the humanfoetus forms into a baby it goes through many stages that connect with majorevolutionary points in the development of the present physical form. Theseinclude those that connect with non-primate mammals, reptiles and fish. At onestage, the embryo has gills and is very much like those of birds, sheep and pigsuntil the eighth week when it goes on its own evolutionary path. In the next fewchapters we will see that the nature of what we think is ‘real’ is such anillusion that shape-shifting is small deal compared with what is possible. Infact, anything, literally anything, is possible. It could be no other way whenyou are dealing with an illusion on the scale I will describe in the thirdsection of the book.As I outlined earlier, Stewart Swerdlow says the Reptilians need mammalianhormonal levels to hold the mammal codes open and maintain human form becausetheir ‘base-line’ state is reptilian and the mammalian codes would close if theydid not consume frequent supplies of human blood. They also want an adrenalinethat enters the bloodstream in large quantities at times of extreme terror.Hence they have victims who know they are going to be sacrificed and they usethe ritual to build their terror to the point of death. This allows them todrink blood full of that adrenaline. Arizona Wilder supplies the sameinformation from her own horrific experience. She says that the blood type theReptilians most desire is that of blond-haired, blue-eyed people, as I explainedearlier, because it is the most effective for the purpose of holding human form.She, like almost every ‘elite’ mind-controlled slave I have encountered, isblonde-haired and blue-eyed. They are also the ones most often chosen to besacrificed by the Illuminati. Red-haired people also seem very important to themfor the same reason and, most of all, they want the blood of pre-pubescentchildren and young women who have not had sex. This is to do with the purity ofthe blood and energy of children, and the changes that take place within theenergy field once a person has experienced sex or puberty. Thus the Illuminatisacrifice children and young women more than anyone and this is the origin ofthe stories throughout history of sacrificing ‘young virgins’ to the gods.Feeding off fearHuman blood is not the only target of these vampires. The Reptilians also feedoff human emotional energy. Physicist Giuliana Conforto says that inter-spaceplanes do not have a natural energy source like a dimension. They are likeneutral zones. Any entities operating there would need to create an energysource for themselves and they have. It is human fear in all its forms. When wefeel fear we generate a vibration, an energy field. Every time we think andfeel, no matter what our state of being may be, we are sending out ‘broadcast’waves that vibrate to the frequency of the particular thought or emotion. Wefeel these frequencies coming from people in what we call ‘vibes’. The lowvibration of fear and its associated emotions like anger, aggression, stress andguilt produce frequencies that pour into the inter-space plane and this hasbecome the energy source of these Reptilian and other entities. The morehumanity feels fear in all its forms the more energy – power – the Reptiliansand other inter-space entities have to sustain them and use back against us. Theentire Illuminati system has been designed to generate the energy of fear andturn the human population into an energy source.In the first of the Matrix movies, the character called Morpheus holds up abattery and says: “The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world built to keepus under control in order to change the human being into this.” That issymbolically correct. The major children’s movie called Monsters Inc., releasedby the Illuminati Disney organisation, had the same theme. The ‘monster’ worlddid not have an energy source and so they walked through ‘doors’ (symbolic ofthe interdimensional gateways) into children’s bedrooms in the human world.There they would frighten children and when the kids screamed with fear themonsters would capture that energy in a tube and take it back through the doorto power their world. This is one major aspect of September 11th and itsaftermath that is not acknowledged because it is so far from conditionedreality. But imagine the fear generated as a result of 9/11 and the two worldwars, the ‘war on terrorism’, and a political, financial, business, military andmedia system that is specifically designed to maintain humanity in a constantstate of fear, worry, stress and anger. Take another look at the microchippingprogramme from this perspective. Once people are microchipped they can beexternally triggered through the chip to produce fear on demand. In the light ofall this, look at this coded speech made by George W. Bush after 9/11. TheIlluminati use reverse language to speak to each other, so black means white;“we will” means “we won’t”; “we do” means “we don’t”; and “them” and “their”means “us” and “ours”:> “The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain. Behind them is a> cult of evil that seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering.> Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by> tears.” His speech writer could not have summed it up better: a cruelty that is “fed,not weakened, by tears”. The more emotion we can be manipulated to projectthrough fear and all its manifestations the more energy they can absorb andrecycle against us. Researcher Alan Walton has uncovered the same themes:> “These vampirial types [of Reptilian] … actually seek to feed off human> emotional energies and life force/essence in order to acquire the energy that> they apparently need not only to infiltrate our world but also our dimension.> Having genetically engineered themselves along more ‘warrior instinct’ lines,> what little connection they might have had to a ‘spiritual’ side has been all> but eliminated, and they are motivated only by the predatory instinct of their> collective which apparently knows only one agenda: conquer, assimilate,> consume! All this has been confirmed by many abductees, especially in more> recent years.” 8 The whole Illuminati agenda is actually based on the terror of not surviving andthe Reptilian mind equates control and having far more than necessary with abetter chance of survival. Most fundamentally to them their survival in theinter-space plane is dependent on humans continuing to be their energy sourceand their worst nightmare is for humans to discover the scam. They have alsocreated a society in which most people are focussed on physical or financialsurvival and that locks them into the reptilian brain and the ‘hive mind’ theywish to impose on the population.Silent invasionAll of these themes can also be found in the Emerald Tablets, as translated byMaurice Doreal:> “In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as are> men. Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted, but appearing to man as men> among men. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men.> Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling> o’er man. Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their> faces be seen. Sought they from the kingdom of shadows, to destroy man and> rule in his place.” This is a superb encapsulation of what has happened and is still happening. TheIlluminati Reptilians manipulate their bloodlines into positions of power – “thecouncils” – and take over those bodies for themselves. It is what we callpossession. The rituals conducted by the Illuminati-controlled secret societieslike the Freemasons, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar, etc., are one way thisis done. The major and ancient Illuminati families know who they are and theirhybrid nature, but there are many other offshoots within societies all over theworld who have no idea that they carry what has been described to me by insidersas the hybrid DNA “corruption”. Nor are they trying to manipulate anyone. Fromwhat I have learned over the years, the DNA corruption lies dormant unless it isactivated and until that point it has no effect on the person. Such people gothrough life oblivious of their bloodline. However, if they come into contactwith the vibrational codes that activate the corruption then that is a verydifferent story. They become seriously open to possession by the inter-spaceentities. This vibrational code or key is generated at the secret societyrituals of the Illuminati network and this is another reason why they haveperformed the same basic rituals since ancient times. They are designed toproduce the vibrational code that activates the DNA corruption and opens thevibrational door to the Reptilian entities. The children of Illuminati familiesare put through the rituals by their parents in the full knowledge that they arebeing opened to possession to allow the baton to be passed on to the nextgeneration. Talk to anyone who has been involved in Satanism and they will tellyou that its hierarchy is decided by the power of the demonic entities that youallow to possess your body during the rituals designed for this end. The themeof ‘selling your soul to the Devil’ is a valid one in the sense that Satanistsallow their bodies to be possessed in return for power in the five-sense world.The same applies to the Illuminati and, in fact, Satanism is one of the majorstrands in their web. One way I have found to identify possessed people is thatno matter what their facial expression may be, including laughter, the eyesnever change. They maintain a cold, fixed, emotionless stare. I have seen fewmore glaring examples of cold Reptilian eyes than those of Hillary Clinton. Nexttime you see her, watch her eyes, the same with Bush and Blair.The Illuminati keep detailed records of who has the dormant DNA corruption. Theyhave used genealogical libraries like the one at the Illuminati-controlledMormon Church in Salt Lake City, Utah, to do this, but the preferred methodtoday is a global DNA database that they are now manipulating into being underthe guise of stopping crime and terrorism. What happens to these unknowing‘corruption carriers’ is that they are targeted by the Illuminati in theknowledge of who they are. They might be making a career in politics, the law,the military, the media and so on, and they will find that their careerssuddenly take off and some powerful people begin to support them. At this stagethey are under the impression that this sponsorship by influential people isbecause of their ability or, in the case of politics, because the supportersbelieve in what the target stands for. But in truth it is because of their DNA.At some point the target is invited to join the secret society network as a goodcareer move and they are put through the rituals that activate the DNAcorruption. Still they will have no idea of what is going on, as only a tiny fewFreemasons know what their bizarre initiation rituals really mean and arestructured to achieve. Once the target’s DNA possession code is triggered by therituals the process of possession by the inter-space entities begins to unfold.The person’s thoughts, emotions and attitudes start to change until they are afully possessed being. How many times do we hear former friends and colleaguesof those in power say that they are not the same people they once knew? We areled to believe that these changes of personality are due to the influences ofpower – power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Of course, thereis some validity in this, but the main reason for the personality change isquite simply that they are no longer the same being, let alone the samecharacter. “Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their formand ruling o’er man.” These are the people who become the presidents, primeministers, banking and business tycoons, media owners and others who run oradminister the Anunnaki agenda, although the most powerfully Reptilian are thosewho dictate from behind the scenes: “Sought they from the Kingdom of Shadows[inter-space plane], to destroy man, and rule in his place.”Meeting their mastersAnother reason for the Illuminati obsession with rituals is to allowother-dimensional Reptilians and other entities to manifest before them. Someresearchers suggest that the Reptilian faction behind the Illuminati wasbanished from the surface of the Earth and this five-sense reality by closingthe interdimensional ‘portals’, which allowed them to move into this reality ordensity very easily. These portals are vortex points on the Earth wheredimensions connect and these are often the places held most sacred by theancients. I have been told a number of times over the years that the CaucasusMountains are the location of a major portal. The portals are similar in theme,if not detail, to the one featured in the film Stargate, the story of an ancientEgyptian people controlled by high-tech, extraterrestrial ‘gods’. In theirrituals, the Satanists summon the manipulating entities into their presence bycreating the vibrational ‘doorways’ that allow them to manifest. Words, coloursand symbols all vibrate energy and the secret rituals use the combinations thathave the required vibrational effect. Researcher Alan Walton writes: “Some claimthat the Crowleyan [Satanic] rituals and Montauk [technology] projects have beenvery useful to them in … tearing holes in the fabric of space-time thatseparates our dimension from theirs.” 9 As the Emerald Tablets say: “Yet,beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open, at times, to theworld” and “Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have beensaid.” (Illuminati rituals to open the ‘stargates’); “Again as time passesonward, shall they take the semblance of men” (which they have). This theme ofsealing the portals might be described in the Bible’s Book of Revelation, whichclearly describes the ‘Devil’ or ‘Satan’ in reptilian terms. It tells of StMichael, an ancient Sumerian/Phoenician deity, defeating the dragon:> “And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the> Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to Earth> and his angels were cast down with him. > “… And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and> Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and> shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more.”> 10 This could also relate to being condemned to live in the inner-Earth.The vibrational veil> “Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their faces be> seen … But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil> from the face of the serpent, able to send him back to his place. Came they to> man and taught him the secret, the Word that only a man can pronounce; swift> then they lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from place among> men.” I have learned from a number of sources that the key to lifting this “veil fromthe face of the serpent” is a sound frequency that disrobes the illusion ofhuman form to reveal their reptilian nature. It resonates a vibration thatprevents them from holding their ‘human’ cover. This same theme can be found inthe movie, They Live (Alive Films 1988). This was the creation of director JohnCarpenter and it offers a visual portrayal of a non-human race controlling theplanet while hiding within human form. Carpenter’s entities control in exactlythe same way as the Illuminati, through secret societies, mind conditioning andownership of the media. In the end, the heroes of the movie reveal theconspiracy when they break the vibrational sound frequency that is maintainingthe illusion that those in power are human. Immediately that vibration isdestroyed, the president and others in power and influence shift into their trueform and the people can see who is really ruling them.> “Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only the> master of brightness shall conquer the shadow of fear … Know ye, O my brother,> that fear is an obstacle great; be master of all in the brightness, the shadow> will soon disappear. Hear ye, and heed my wisdom, the voice of light is clear,> seek the valley of shadow and light only will appear.” Those who dabble without knowledge in what has become known as the ‘occult’ openthemselves to manipulation by these entities, Reptilians and otherwise. Theinter-space plane is home to many misguided, malevolent entities, and this isthe origin of the legends and tales of demons and ‘evil’ spirits. In fact, theword ‘occult’ has been given an unfairly bad name. It merely means ‘hidden’ andthe same knowledge can be used for good or ill. If you use the ‘occult’knowledge with love in your heart and positive intent, you maintain a highvibration and connect with that level of consciousness. If you use it withoutunderstanding (like those who play with ouija boards) or with ill intent, youcan connect yourself with the malevolent vibrational range that this represents.The emphasis in the Emerald Tablets on living without fear is also a vitalpoint. This is how we are controlled and it is the inter-space energy source –the fear of what others think of us; fear of death; fear of being alone; fear ofpoverty, fear for our families and children; fear of war. The list is endless.The emotion of fear resonates to the frequency range of the inter-space entitiesand when we are consumed by fear we are much easier for them to influence andcontrol.The hidden ‘team’With the knowledge that we are manipulated by ‘human’ bodies possessed bynon-human, other-dimensional entities, the apparently complex, mysterious andcontradictory begins to come into clearer focus. People think that Americanswould not slaughter Americans, for example, and government agencies could nothave been involved in the planning of 9/11. But the leaders are not American;they are Reptilians and other non-human entities possessing a ‘human body’ thatwas ‘born’ in America. It is the same with the leaders in Britain, Spain,Pakistan, China, Germany and all the rest. These possessed ‘leaders’ have noallegiance to the people of these nations, their only allegiance is tothemselves as Reptilians that have been manipulating this world for aeons tocreate a global centralised fascist state through which they can control amicrochipped, constantly monitored population. Their allegiance is to along-planned conspiracy to create a structure in which every child born intothis five-sense world is immediately microchipped and turned into an externallymanipulated and controlled battery to provide an energy source for theinter-space entities that are running the show by occupying physical bodies.Image [../Images/00047.jpg]Figure 42: The leaders in different countries may appear to be from different‘races’ with an allegiance to their ‘nation’; but they are mostly from thehybrid bloodlines, possessed by Reptilian entities working to the same goal ofglobal domination. There is disagreement and conflict between them over powerand detail, but they are united by the same overall agenda I have symbolised the structure of this Reptilian control in Figure 42. TheIlluminati manipulate their bloodlines (in other words the inter-space entities)into the positions of power across the world through their secret societynetwork in each country. Most of these leaders in the various countries areworking to the same goal and they often only appear to be in conflict for thepurposes of deluding the people into a false reality. There is also greatrivalry on one level between different elements of the Illuminati because as oneresearcher told me years ago: “They are like a gang of bank robbers. They allagree on the job, but then argue about how the spoils are shared out.” Those whoare consumed by the desire for power and control are not going to switch thatoff when it comes to having power over those on the same side. But they alldepend on the agenda for their collective power over humanity and that is thecement that holds the warring factions together. The Reptilian leaders of thevarious countries play out a pre-arranged plan that appears to the public to bethe random result of random events. But in fact, as the Illuminati puppetFranklin Delano Roosevelt said: “Whatever happens in politics you can bet it wasmeant to happen.” The leaders of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan,Russia, China etc … are not American, Arab, Pakistani, Russian and Chinese,except in their outer five-sense form. They are Reptilian-possessed beingsworking to the same agenda and what appears on the ‘news’ is a movie designed toobscure the truth. They answer to a strictly hierarchical structure and anyoneis expendable when the agenda demands it.The Li bloodline in China, for example, is one of the major Illuminatibloodlines on the planet and this has been bred into other races over hundreds,perhaps thousands, of years to the point where it does not manifest as a‘Chinese’ body, but still maintains the corrupted DNA. This happened, forexample, when the ‘Golden Horde’ flooded into the Caucasus and Eastern Europe tointerbreed with the bloodlines that came from Sumer and Egypt. A fellowresearcher contacted me to say that he had an excellent Chinese source thatclaimed to have seen the Illuminati Li family ‘tree’ and saw that it connectedto Bill Clinton and the Bush family. Funnily enough, I have always thought thatColin Powell looked far more Asian than African-American. The Reptilianbloodlines do not relate to an Earth race, they have infiltrated all races andcultures. The Reptilian entities in the positions of power manipulate thepeoples of the world to fight each other in the five-sense prison and in doingso advance their structure of global centralisation while producing vastquantities of fear to feed their own ‘world’. The human race has been duped allthis time and never more so than now. The conditioned reality they areprogrammed to accept prevents them from seeing the malevolent game that is beingplayed out all around them. The idea of Reptilians controlling their lives byhiding within human form is beyond most people’s comprehension because it is sofar from their conditioned sense of possibility. They have never been told thevibrational truths nor had access to the ancient and modern evidence andinformation that would tell them a very different version of reality.There is still much to know before we can fully understand how these apparentlybizarre concepts and experiences fit together. But after all these years oftravelling and research, I can see that one level of this amazing story is thatother-dimensional entities with a definite reptilian emphasis are possessingcertain hybrid bloodlines that are manipulated into the major positions ofpower. We see only the ‘human’ level of them with our five-senses, but beyondthat frequency veil our world is being controlled by entities that look nothinglike we do. What you have read so far will appear fantastic beyond wordscompared with the ‘world’ sold to us through ‘education’ and the media.Shape-shifting Reptilians controlling global society? Are you kidding?? But, asmy journey continued, I realised that not even this was the end of the story.Far from it.SOURCES > 1 Giuliana Conforto, Man’s Cosmic Game (Edizioni Noesis 1998) and Giordano> Bruno’s Future Science (Edizioni Noesis 2000).

Theevent, over ten days, would offer the participants the opportunity to experiencethe ‘psychoactive’ effects of a plant called ayahuasca, which has been used bySouth American shamans for hundreds of years (at least) to take people intoother states of consciousness beyond the five-sense realm. Ayahuasca is known asthe ‘teacher plant’ because it allows people to experience these unseen realmswhere so much can be learned about self, life and reality. It is also dubbed the‘plant of the gods’, no doubt because it can allow you to see those dimensionswhere the ‘gods’ of myth reside. In fact, it was the number of times thatparticipants at these events had seen reptilian entities and imagery in theiraltered states of awareness that led the organisers to invite me.Ayahuasca is much used in religious ceremonies and rituals in parts of Braziland it is quite legal in such circumstances. Around the ‘Western World’ it islargely illegal to own or take the brew, as it is with potions in general thatcan transport our conscious awareness beyond the five-senses. I wonder why?? Ijumped at the chance to accept the Amazon offer, although I had somereservations at one point when I learned of the possible physical effects ofvomiting and shitting with a vengeance. Once I was assured that the participantswould be made well aware of this before they proceeded, I agreed to be there. Iknew this was the dimensional door I was looking for to take the next step in myjourney. I had reached the age of 50 without consuming a single drug or potionthat was labelled ‘psychoactive’; no magic mushrooms, no nothing. But I could gono further in my understanding without taking my conscious awareness to placesbeyond the veil. I also learned that even those who were regular experiencers ofmushrooms and other such reality changers were aware that ayahuasca wasimmensely powerful. “You have never taken anything and you are starting withthat?” I was asked. Ayahuasca contains many powerful hallucinogenic propertiesincluding Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, a naturally occurring component of themetabolism of mammals and plants. DMT is known by some as the ‘spirit molecule’.In January 2003 I arrived in the Amazon with my wife, Pamela. In the two weeksbefore, as we had travelled the Native American lands of northern Arizona, I hadbeen hearing a clear ‘voice’ (thought transference or telepathy) in quietmoments communicating information that proved to be remarkably accurate. Some ofthe detailed messages I was given seemed blatantly at odds with the way eventswere looking, but the circumstances changed and the ‘voice’ was confirmed to becorrect. When I first arrived at the Amazon location I had some unease and Idecided, as always, to let synchronicity and intuition guide my decisions aboutwhether and when to take the ayahuasca. I was not going to do anything justbecause others did so or because it was written in the schedule. The nightbefore the first ayahuasca session the ‘voice’ said that I would not be takingit with the rest of the group the following evening, but instead I would betaking it on my own. This seemed strange and made no sense because the sessionswere arranged for every other day and all the people were due to experience theeffects together in a large round house specially built for the purpose. Thenext day I went back to Manaus to work on the Internet to keep up with eventsand provide postings for my website, www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com]. There was plenty of time to get there, do the work,and get back for the ayahuasca session. But two people who came with me hadproblems with arrangements they had to make and although my work was finished Ihad to wait for them because we were sharing the same vehicle. When at last wearrived in the darkness at the Manaus ferry for the river crossing on the returnjourney I saw it was just leaving and we had to wait ages for it to come back.Even when we were within sight of the location our flashing headlights did notfor some time attract the attention of those who needed to bring a boat totransport us across a river inlet. Add all these delays together and theayahuasca session had already started by the time I returned. I was tired andfrustrated and not in the space I wanted to be in. So I missed the session andlater asked to take the potion or ‘tea’ the next night by myself. This is whathappened and the voice had been correct.Around 9 o’clock in the evening I took the ayahuasca in the form of a drink in asmall glass. I thought it tasted a bit like liquorice. I was in the big wooden‘round house’ building, alone in the darkness, except for Zoe, one of theorganisers, who has experimented with all kinds of such drugs and theircombinations. There can’t be much left of the rainforest that he has not drunkor smoked! I liked Zoe. We didn’t always agree to say the least, but he’s a niceman with a big heart. I have heard it said that the plant takes you here ortakes you there. I don’t agree with that. I think that ayahuasca opens thechannels (or rather deludes you into thinking it does) and allows you to takeyourself in conscious awareness to where you already are. Some will see darkplaces that reflect subconscious states and others will go to paradise. Wherepeople are at in their deeper levels may not be where they appear to be in theirconscious lives. A happy-go-lucky five-sense personality, for example, can be afront to hide subconscious emotional trauma that can manifest as a ‘dark’ayahuasca experience.By the way, I will state the obvious because sometimes that can be missed. Thesubconscious is only subconscious to the conscious mind. At its own level ofawareness, it, too, is conscious and has a different reality to the five-sense‘conscious mind’ that directly experiences this ‘world’. Also, what is thesubconscious? It is all that is not conscious to the five-sense realm. In otherwords, it is infinite. Like the conscious mind, the subconscious can be caughtin the illusion or be aware of its infinity. Which level of the infinitesubconscious that is communicating with the conscious mind will obviously make afundamental difference to the way people see themselves and their sense ofreality. It is the difference between knowing you are an expression of theInfinite One or believing you are an ‘ordinary’ and ‘powerless’ nonentity.I began to feel the effects of the ayahuasca pretty quickly and I felt nauseousand agitated. I then began to scream out years of pent up frustration and I meanscream. The frustration going back to the days of the mass ridicule, thesuppressed emotion I didn’t know was there, was unleashed into the darkness.Good riddance. Some people, as I was to learn, can vomit to Olympian proportionsafter taking ayahuasca, while others have no such effect. The idea is to hold itback until at least an hour after you have taken the plant because by then ithas ‘metabolised’ and can do its work. Zoe’s announcement during the sessions of“One hour – you may vomit now if you wish” became one of my abiding memories ofthe event. Anyway, vomit I did not and after my screaming session I went back tothe mattress on the floor feeling incredibly calm and at peace. When theayahuasca effects kick in you go into altered states when you close your eyesand you see bright, swirling colours and images. But as soon as you open youreyes you are back in five-sense reality, albeit in a slightly altered form. Iliked that because comparing the two was interesting. The more powerful theexperience becomes the less you want to open your eyes and when you do theydon’t want to stay open for long. Anyhow, that is what happened to me,especially on the second night.The ‘One’I was soon to understand why I was doing this first session by myself because Istarted to speak out loud and that would not have been possible with everyoneelse in the room having their own experiences. I remember most of the words andall of the themes quite clearly. As I lay on my back looking up at the pitchdarkness, my arms stretched out, much as they did in a standing position on themound in Peru. Out of my mouth, in a very different voice to ‘David Icke’, camethe words, slowly and powerfully, “I am love”. I then began to repeat: “I ameverything and everything is me, I am infinite possibility.” With that I felt afantastic energy pour from my heart chakra and fill the room. A strip light onthe ceiling began to flicker on and off. After a few minutes, three of thelights came on full power. I looked across and thought, “Why has Zoe turned thelights on?” But he hadn’t. The lights were all switched off and they had come onby themselves without electricity. Then the equipment playing music switched offand came back on again after ten seconds or so. Weird stuff on the face of it,but I could understand why an energy of the power I was experiencing couldeffect the electrical circuitry. I clearly felt an energy coming out of my heartchakra and arching from there to my head. The words I was speaking came throughthis source. I even called Zoe over to ask if this was what usually happened. Hesaid everyone was different.I began to speak fluently in my altered state. It wasn’t that I had thoughts andthen articulated them in speech. The words just came from my mouth and that isthe first I knew of them. I will summarise what they said and what came to meeven more powerfully in another form the following night. In the following twochapters I will detail some of the gathering wealth of evidence amongopen-minded scientists to support what I was told. Some of the information can’tbe yet verified ‘scientifically’ and you will have to use your intuition todecide what you make of it. But much of it can. I was told in my altered statesthat all that exists is one infinite consciousness, which was referred to as‘The Infinite’, ‘Oneness’ and the ‘One’. In our manipulated, illusory, realitywe had become detached from the One (in our minds, though not in fact) andtherefore we viewed everything in terms of division and duality instead ofseeing that all is connected, all is the same Infinite Oneness. This illusorysense of disconnection is the mind prison I call the Matrix.The time loopMy words in the first ayahuasca session said that the five-sense ‘world’ that wedaily experience is a ‘time loop’ that goes around and around basicallyrepeating the same sequence in theme if not detail. What we call the ‘future’eventually becomes the ‘past’ and spins around to repeat the ‘present’ over andover. That old Jimmy Ruffin song I’ve Passed This Way Before should be theanthem of the planet, it would seem. The lyrics say:> Life lends a crushing blow> And once again a heart is broken> And as history repeats itself> These few words are sadly spoken > I’ve passed this way before> And I’ve felt this pain before> A hurt that took so long to end> Has found my poor heart again This is basically what happens in the Time Loop. The same experiences keeprepeating. The cover picture of this book was produced by an artist friend, NeilHague, from a design and information I gave to him that symbolised what Ilearned in the ayahuasca sessions (Figure 43, overleaf). I would emphasise thatthe picture is only symbolic because I was told that the Matrix is a vortex,like a whirlpool in a river, with the Time Loop – our five-sense reality – inthe densest part of the spiral. Think of the Matrix as a whirlpool and theInfinite Oneness as the river. The Matrix is still the ‘river’, the InfiniteOne, but, like a whirlpool or eddy, it is operating in its own little world toits own agenda. What has happened, I was told in my altered states, is that theMatrix has forgotten it is the Infinite – the whirlpool has forgotten it is theriver. Vortices can be remarkably stable if the circumstances don’t change toodrastically. Observe a whirlpool in a river and so long as the flow of watercontinues in a certain direction and speed the vortex will hold indefinitely. Inthe same way, the Matrix/Time Loop is going around and around in a perpetuatingspiral or cycle that has become a prison for the consciousness trapped by itsseductions and illusions. The imprisoned consciousness, too, has forgotten it isInfinite Oneness.Conversations with the ‘One’On the first night I spoke the words out loud and on the second I heard apowerful female voice as clear as can be that added much more detail. This iswhat I was told over those two nights in altered states lasting a total of somesix to seven hours. I will refer to the communicator as ‘the voice’. The TimeLoop is encased within a Matrix of ‘non-physical levels’ that have also lostcontact with Infinite Oneness. These ‘non-physical’ dimensions of the Matrix aresymbolised in the cover illustration by the ball of netting that encompasses theTime Loop. The ‘non-physical’ levels are the dimensions to which most ‘human’consciousness returns after a ‘life’ in the five-sense realm at the moment wecall ‘death’. It is free of the physical body, but it is still caught in theMatrix. I will come back to this later. The very fact that we believe in time isconfirmation of the illusion that we take to be ‘real’. Time does not exist,except in our minds. What we call ‘time’ is the illusion of passing throughsomething. But if we are already everything, how can we pass or travel throughourselves? So how can there be ‘time’? If we symbolise the human body as theInfinite, how can your body travel through your body? It is already the wholebody to start with and how can it travel through itself? When everything is One,there can be no ‘time’, only all things existing and expressing in the infiniteNOW. ‘Past’ and ‘future’ are illusions designed to entrap us in disconnection.They are different realities happening at the same moment, in the same infiniteNOW. The apparent sequence of one era following another in passing ‘time’ is anillusion of the Time Loop.Subconscious mind had become imprisoned by fear, the voice said, and this hadcaused the illusion of disconnection from the Infinite or Infinite Love, theonly ‘is’ that we all are. This had reached such proportions that these lowerlevels of subconscious mind had developed a deep and deepening fear of theunknown that lay beyond its ‘disconnected’ awareness. It had forgotten that itis Infinite Love and that what lay outside of its apparent boundaries was alsoInfinite Love. To ease its fear of the unknown, subconscious mind had created acollective thought projection – a sort of three-D ‘movie’ – that I refer to asthe Matrix. How this is done, collectively and individually, I will discuss whenI get to the scientific research into the nature of reality and how we createit. The Matrix is a self contained system that has lost contact with theInfinite that exists beyond its illusory reality. In fact, it is the Infinite;everything is and can only be. But it has simply forgotten. The voice said thatthe key level of the Matrix is the repeating Time Loop that we know as thefive-sense world. This is the ‘power station’ that feeds the whole system. Theloop was created to provide familiarity that eased the fear of the unknown andwas a very much more pleasant experience at first than it is in our reality.When people are in fear, the voice went on, they find comfort in the familiarand predictable and this had happened on a collective level of subconsciousmind. It was a way for consciousness to whistle in the dark, giving itselfcomfort in the familiar. What is humanity’s biggest fear in our dailyexperience? Fear of the unknown. Subconscious mind created a dream world thatwas to become a nightmare. Seven months after this experience in Brazil, I cameacross an ancient Hindu myth. It said human consciousness had begun as a ripplethat decided to leave the ocean of consciousness – the “timeless, space-less andeternal”.1 When it awakened to itself in this ‘disconnected’ state, the mythsaid, it forgot that it was part of the infinite ocean and felt isolated andseparated. This is basically what the voice told me had happened. Wilson BryanKey described the human attitude to the unknown very well in The Age ofManipulation:Image [../Images/00048.jpg]Figure 43: The Time Loop symbolised by artist, Neil Hague. The five-sense‘world’ is an illusory ‘loop’ of manufactured ‘time’ in which the ‘future’becomes the ‘past’. It is the human equivalent of a mouse running around on awheel in a cage > “Humans detest uncertainty. Uncertainties produce anxieties. To reduce> anxiety, if no factual structure is readily available, humans will simply> invent one or accept a ready-to-wear media reality structure … these> perceptions, of course, are fictional constructs.” 2 The voice said that this emotional state had led collectively to the creation ofthe illusion – the Matrix – that humans believe to be real.The Frankenstein MatrixAt this point the Matrix and its five-sense Time Loop were still only acollective mind projection of the type now being identified by the moreenlightened expressions of science. This projection was dependent for itssurvival on subconscious mind continuing to hold that reality, much like a movieprojector beaming on a screen. Once the projector is turned off (in this casethe sense of reality changes) the movie disappears, too, and another is createdto reflect the new sense of what is real. How this is done can be explained verysimply and I will do that in the next chapter. However, the thought projectionitself took on a ‘life’ of its own when it gained access to an energy sourceindependent of that which was projecting it. This energy source, the voice wenton, was fear. The Matrix – the projected reality of subconscious mind – absorbedthe energy of fear generated particularly within the ‘five-sense’ Time Loop andtook on a life and agenda of its own. That agenda was to generate as much fearas possible to empower itself even further. The Matrix became a Frankenstein.The created or projected thought field had accessed an energy source to become acreator and projector of its own illusory reality.As these words were being spoken, I was shown scenes from the Disney animation,The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, in which the sorcerer had created an entity to do allthe jobs he didn’t want to do, but then the entity had taken over events andbecome the sorcerer’s controller. Subconscious mind created the Matrix/Time Loopas a predictable, familiar ‘world’, but it had lost control. Both subconsciousand conscious ‘five-sense’ mind were subject to the manipulation of this nowself-aware ‘entity’ that the Matrix had become. “Humanity is controlled bydeception?” the voice said. “No, humanity is controlled by self-deception.” Thesubconscious had created the prison from its disconnected state ofself-deception and now it and the conscious mind were sitting in a cell of theirown making, with the ‘cell’ dictating events. The reason why the Matrixprojection needs the energy of fear to empower itself is because it is fear,self-aware fear, the voice said. It had been created originally by the fear ofsubconscious mind and, as projected fear, this is the only energy source theMatrix entity could access and absorb. The more fear its manipulations generatethrough wars, conflict, stress, guilt and aggression etc., the greater its powerto increase this cycle of fear production.Reptilian programsThe ultimate manipulator of the Matrix and its five-sense Time Loop, the voicesaid, was the very fabric of the Matrix itself and its power source was theconsciousness trapped within its vibrational walls. The Matrix was a self-wareentity that was knowingly manipulating to ensure its own survival by generatingthe events necessary to produce the fear that empowered it. Humans were indeed‘batteries’ or power stations for the Matrix and we were providing the power tomaintain our own prison. The Reptilians did ‘exist’, said the voice, but theywere holographic thought projections of the Matrix very much like the agents or‘sentient programs’ that manipulate in the Matrix movies. They could eitheroperate as a reptilian projection or hide behind an apparently ‘human’ form,just as the sentient programs morph in and out of different human forms in themovies. Either way, the Reptilians and other projected agents of the Matrix werenot ‘real’ in consciousness terms; they were projections, thought fields orhighly sophisticated software programs.The existence of such thought-projected holographic phenomena is now supportedby scientific research and experiment, as we shall see. Holograms areprojections of energy or ‘light’ that appear to the observer to be athree-dimensional form, but in fact they are a series of codes and wave patternsthat only take on the illusion of 3-D when a laser is shone upon them. Or in thecase of the holographic projections in the Matrix, when they are observed intoillusory reality by the human mind. In the next chapter I will explain how thisworks. It is so simple. As I was told with great clarity in my second ayahuascaexperience, the whole of five-sense reality is a holographic illusion that onlyexists in a ‘solid’ form because the human mind/brain makes it appear that way.The ‘3-D’ world of landscape, seas, buildings and human bodies, only exists inthat form when we look at it! Otherwise it is a mass of vibrational fields andcodes. In the movies, the Matrix is depicted from the outside as a series ofgreen numbers and codes, while inside it is experienced as the sort of world wethink we live in – mountains, streets, cars, people and so on. That is a goodanalogy. I know this all sounds fantastic at first hearing, but these themes arenow being confirmed at the cutting edge of scientific research.The voice said that when the Reptilians absorbed human fear they were absorbingit for the Matrix itself because they are projections of the Matrix. But theywere not aware of this. Indeed, the Reptilians, other ‘demonic entities’, andthe Illuminati hierarchy were not aware of who their ultimate master really was– the Matrix itself. The manipulators were also being manipulated. The Reptilian‘sentient programs’ did not have human emotion, the voice said, because theywere just that, ‘sentient programs’, and are not conscious in the way humans areconscious. “If you programmed a computer to kill children, would that computerhave any emotional problems with that?” the voice asked. No, it would justfollow the programming because computers do not have emotion. They do what theyare programmed to do. It was the same with the Illuminati and the ‘Reptilians’ –they were, in effect, like highly sophisticated computer software. They werelike digital people implanted in the movies alongside human actors. They appearto be the same, but they are not. Unemotional computers can process informationfaster and more efficiently than human conscious minds in a disconnected stateand, in the same way, the sentient program projections of the Matrix have beenable to out-fox and out-think humans. But this can only continue until humanityremembers who it really is and where it really comes from, and reconnects withits true and infinite self. Then the projected holographic manipulators willhave intelligence akin to counting beads compared with human potential and, as Iwas told, that moment is fast approaching. This is what happened symbolically tothe Neo character in the first Matrix movie when he awakened to the illusion oflife and death and the dream world he had been living in. Once he reached thatpoint of reconnected awareness, the agents, the sentient programs, all-powerfuluntil then, were suddenly no problem to overcome.“Love does not abandon”The voice said that the Matrix, and particularly the five-sense Time Loop, hadbecome so vibrationally dense, and the imprisoned consciousness so lost in theillusion, that the Infinite One was intervening in the ‘game’. Control of theMatrix and the Time Loop were in the process of being dismantled so thatentrapped consciousness could return ‘home’ to conscious reconnection with theInfinite. I heard many times in my altered, but self-aware state: “Love does notabandon.” There were no chosen ones whom ‘God’ had selected. There was no ‘God’as humans perceived it, only the infinity or ‘Oneness’ of existence. “All wouldbe gathered in”, the voice said, “and no sheep would be left in the fieldalone.” The Infinite was the balance of all things, while the Matrix wascalculated and manipulated imbalance, in which Oneness had been divided intopolarities and dualities of ‘light’ and ‘dark’, ‘good’ and ‘bad’, male andfemale and all the rest. These polarised states of duality not only offered themassive potential for fear and conflict, they also ensured that such imbalanceand division would disconnect mind from a sense of balance and Oneness – theInfinite. Without such division and polarised reality there could be no Matrix.The process of removing the Matrix control was well advanced, the voice said.Expressions of the Infinite had entered the Matrix and especially its densestlevel, the Time Loop, to anchor the energy that would break up the fearvibration that held it together. These expressions of the Infinite taking humanform had not been aware of their role for most of their ‘physical’ lives andmany were still not. This was because they had to experience the emotional andmental states that held humanity in disconnected servitude and in doing soattune themselves to the low vibrational frequencies of these states of being.When this was done the Infinite could feed its energy of Oneness and balancethrough such ‘people’ and transform those mental and emotional frequencies onwhich the Matrix and the Time Loop depend. This is represented in the cover ofthe book by the hole in the Time Loop/Matrix. After the first session ofayahuasca in which these matters were addressed, I recalled a communication Ihad been given through a psychic in 1990 that said:> “I feel you are sensing now the energies coming in, the energies surrounding> your planet. This is causing many of you to ask questions. It is causing many> of you to re-evaluate completely your way of life, where you feel you wish to> go, what you want to do. It is causing tremendous upheavals. Some of these> upheavals are very confusing, very distressing, very disturbing. Some people> in partnerships are finding they can no longer continue in those partnerships> because their partners cannot tune into what they are tuning into. It is> causing a great deal of disturbance … > “… As the consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those of you light> workers who are working to raise your consciousness, you will be able to hold> more and more refined vibrations, and so we will be able to use you as a> catalyst to be able to feed in more and more energies.” This was a more basic version of what I learned in these ayahuasca experiences.Valerie Hunt, professor of kinesiology at the University of California in LosAngeles, has developed the use of technology to measure the human energy fieldand this has confirmed that a person’s state of mind affects their vibrationalspeed or frequency. Those focussed only on five-sense reality are the lowest andthe more people are using their higher senses the higher the frequency of theirenergy field.3 This is the reason for the phrase … “As the consciousness levelof your planet raises itself, those of you light workers who are working toraise your consciousness, you will be able to hold more and more refinedvibrations.” Or, as the voice told me, the more the Infinite expressed itself inthe Matrix through its incarnate aspects, the more people would begin to feelits manifestation and be transformed by its harmony and balance to awaken andremember who and what they really are. The veil of ignorance would lift fromtheir vibrational ‘eyes’ and they would remember they were all that exists – theOne.This is the transformation – the ‘Truth Vibrations’ – that I was told about whenmy mind was first blown in 1990. As I have travelled the world since then, Ihave seen how this phenomenon has become so apparent and continues to gatherpace by the day. I was told that the transformation of entrapped consciousness,from the illusion of disconnected limitation to reconnected infinity, is nowhappening. The voice emphasised that this was not a ‘maybe’ and that we wereseeing the last desperate death throes of Matrix control. “Do you think theInfinite is going to have a problem with George Bush?” it said, laughing. Thisdid not mean that we just had to sit around and wait for all this to happen. Wewere the Infinite and we all had roles to play in the transformation of thisreality. The Infinite was expressing itself at all levels of the Matrix as thosein conscious awareness exposed its illusions. I was told that the most importantlevel of the Matrix that had to be transformed was the ‘five-sense’ Time Loop.This was the densest level and it acted as an ‘anchor’, or like a light thatcaptivates the moths, and it provided most of the ‘fear energy’ that sustainedthe Matrix entity. The transformation was being brought about by infusingInfinite Oneness into the vibrational concrete and fear – the ‘freeze vibration’I was told about in 1990. This was why people were changing and this wouldcontinue and increase apace until we were experiencing a very different realityto the one we currently ‘see’.Words were only necessary to keep the five-sense ‘mind’ occupied while theenergy infusions did their work, the voice told me. I was shown a scene ofmyself standing on a stage in a theatre. I was saying nothing and the audiencewere looking at each other in bewilderment. The voice said, laughing: “You onlyspeak words because if you did not, the audience would be sitting there asking‘when is he going to start?’ – not knowing that you already had!” Unseen energywas the real transformer, not human language. That was only to keep thefive-sense mind happy. More and more people are waking up and this is why: avibrational change is unfolding ever more quickly. The voice said the reasonthere was such an effort underway to imprison humanity even further in the fastemerging global fascist state or New World Order was a desperate attempt to holdthe game together and stop the awakening of the people – especially through themicrochips that are designed to artificially suppress the quickening vibrationsof awakening humanity. What the manipulators did not realise, I was told, iswhat they are dealing with. They are ignorant of the true background to the‘game’ in which they, too, are pawns. The voice said:> “This transformation is not a maybe, it is not something that might happen or> we hope will happen if things go according to ‘plan’. It is happening now and> the power and speed of the change will become ever more profound and obvious.> What you are seeing is the last desperate attempt of the ‘Matrix’ to stop the> inevitable, that’s all. The transformation from prison to paradise is a done> deal.” Remember who you areThese words were thought fields decoded by my mind and so the language issomething like I would use in my own speech. An Italian or an Egyptian woulddecode them in their language, as I explained earlier. On the second night Itook an increased dose of ayahuasca and at first the feeling of screaming andnausea returned. This time I was with the rest of the group, and as I began toenter an altered state, I asked Zoe if he would come with me back to my room toavoid disrupting the others. There I was, screaming out more frustration andheaving without being sick. I stood out on the balcony looking out at the trees,heaving into the darkness. From out of nowhere I said to my nauseous body “Ilove you” and with that the nausea left me and the need to scream in frustrationlifted from me also. It sounds cheesy, but that is what happened. I felt calmand at peace again and went back to the round house to rejoin the others. Themost profound night of my life was about to begin.As I lay down with my eyes closed, I began to see the swirling colours andimages again and for a time they had a very Chinese feel about them. Then Ibegan to hear a voice as clear as can be. Not some distant ‘what did it say?’type of voice, but a loud and powerful one, more so than anything I hadexperienced. It was female and spoke with great dignity, assurance and clarity.“David”, it said, “We are going to take you to where you come from, so you canremember who you are.” With that I was taken to a realm of indescribable bliss.There was no ‘time’ and there was no ‘place’. Everything just was. I had nobody, I was only consciousness, and I was everything. There were no divisions,no polarities, no black and white, no us and them. I was infinite, but I wasalso completely self-aware, as an ‘individual’ with my own point of observationwithin the whole. This is what we all are and if only people could experiencethe bliss of Oneness the world of the five-senses would be transformed in aninstant. The energy was not vibrating as it does in the Matrix. I experienced itas either stillness or as the waves of an ocean moving in slow motion and inperfect harmony. “This is the Infinite, David”, the voice said, “This is whereyou come from and this is where you shall return.” The following words thenbegan to repeat over and over in my mind:> “Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion; Infinite Love> is the only truth – everything else is illusion; Infinite Love is the only> truth – everything else is illusion.” At one point I began to form a question in my mind. I was going to say: “Youreally mean everything?” But before the thought could form, the voiceinterrupted: “Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion; nobuts, no exceptions, that’s it.” This word ‘love’ has connotations in which itis often perceived as weak or naïve. I hear people say, “You need more thanlove, mate.” But let me define what is meant by love in the context of InfiniteLove. It is the balance of all. Infinite Oneness is the only truth, everythingelse is illusion would be another way of saying it. Therefore, Infinite ‘Love’is also Infinite Intelligence, Infinite Knowledge, Infinite Everything. I wastold how humanity had been manipulated to identify itself with illusory‘personalities’ and not as the Infinite that we are. This had trapped people inthe illusions of a disconnected state. The voice would return to this theme, asit communicated with me constantly through the hours that night.“Why do you think you needed to scream and try to throw up?” I was asked. “Doyou feel any frustration or anger in this place?” No, I did not. “Do you haveany worries or fear or guilt where you are now?” No, I didn’t, there was onlyharmony, peace, love and bliss. “Frustration, anger, fear, guilt and pain areonly illusions, figments of disconnected mind”, the voice said. “They don’texist except in your imagination.” It went on: “Do you think the Infinite youare now experiencing needs to throw up?” No. “Do you think the Infinite evergets ill?” No. “Of course not, these states are only illusions of theconditioned mind.” Later in the night I began to feel a little nauseous againand immediately the voice said:> “Where is your nausea coming from? Do you think the Infinite is feeling> nauseous now? So you must be identifying with your body. It’s an illusion,> David, your body is an illusion, and so must be the nausea you think you are> feeling in your body. If your body does not exist how can nausea or pain?> These are illusions and they only exist in the minds of those caught in the> Matrix.” ‘Time’ to confuseWith that, the nausea left me, never to return. The voice told me more about theMatrix and the Time Loop. It said that the illusion of ‘time’ was necessary tomaintain imprisoned consciousness in a disconnected state. While people relatedto the movement of ‘time’, they could not relate to the Infinite One that was‘no time’. The Matrix entity, ‘self-aware fear’, had created an illusion of timeto trap its prey, its prisoners, in a state of disconnection in which they wouldforget who they were. I was told that while the five-sense Time Loop created theillusion of ‘time’ moving ‘forward’ most powerfully within the Matrix, the other‘non-physical’ levels also had versions of this. The voice said that humanpsychics and mediums may make contact with entities that say their realms do nothave ‘time’, as we know it, and those who have had so-called ‘out-of-body’ and‘near death experiences’, may say that in their out-of-body state there was no‘time’. But the very vibrational nature of the Matrix was different to the truly‘no time’ state of the Infinite and in a sense manipulated ‘time’ was prevalentthroughout the Matrix.I got the impression that the detail of what was meant here was beyond theability of human language to express. The out-of-body experiencers often spokeof being in a place of ‘no time’ because what they were feeling was such adifferent version of ‘time’ to that of the Time Loop. It appeared that they wereexperiencing ‘no time’ when it was a different version of ‘time’. The Time Loopproduced the most fear to sustain the Matrix because the five-sense reality mostfundamentally identified with time and the movement from ‘past’ to ‘future’.Those experiencing the Time Loop were the most thoroughly disconnected fromtheir no-time self, the Infinite. Everything in the Time Loop was geared toindoctrinating the ‘time’ illusion. “Do you think the Infinite gets old?” askedthe voice. “Human minds are programmed to believe that their bodies age and sothey do and this strengthens the illusion more than anything of passing frompast to future.” Nothing aged in truth because there was no time, no past and nofuture. Only illusion draws a pension, it said. DNA also carried the programmingof aging that the mind accepts as its reality, but DNA was also an illusion. “Doyou think the Infinite has DNA or worries about its cancer gene? Illusion!” Atone stage during the night I saw the Moon appearing above the clouds and thevoice said:> “Ah the Moon, the Moon, how the poets wax lyrical about the Moon, the Moon.> Illuuusion! The Moon is a holographic projection to give the illusion of the> movement from past to future, the passage of ‘time’. That is what it is there> for, to capture the mind in the time illusion. Do you think the Infinite needs> the Sun to survive? Do you see a Sun in this place you are now? You are the> Infinite so why do you need the Sun to sustain you? You are the Infinite and> all is the Infinite. Why do you feel heat from the rays of the Sun? Because> that is what the Matrix mind and body is programmed and conditioned to feel> and so it does. It is all illusion. The Sun and Moon are projected holograms> to provide the illusion of night and day – the movement of ‘time’.” I was told that what we call the universe is a holographic illusion akin tolooking up at the ‘sky’ projected on the ceiling of a planetarium. The onlydifference was that in the ‘universe’ the projections appeared to be in 3-Dbecause they were holograms. The ‘universe’ was a figment of our conditionedimagination, the voice said, and it was only part of our reality because webelieved it was. The universe was also far smaller than people perceived. “Lookat the sky in a planetarium and it seems so vast, yet it only goes as high asthe ceiling.” Then the voice said: “Do you think that’s the Earth you’re lyingon now? Mmmm. Illuuusion!” As with everything in the Time Loop and throughoutthe Matrix, the Earth was a holographic projection and so was its illusory‘surface’. “You are lying on the Earth now only because you think you are”, thevoice said. If you are new to all this and think how unbelievable and fantasticit is, you are going to be amazed how much scientific evidence is now coming tolight to confirm that this is correct. “Remember always”, said the voice,“Infinite Love is the only truth, everything else is illusion – everything.” Itwent on:> “If it vibrates, it is illusion. The Infinite does not vibrate; it is the> harmony and Oneness of all. Only illusion vibrates – that which is created by> the imagination and delusion of mind.” Laws of illusionI was told that the ‘laws’ of physics were also illusions. “There are no laws ofphysics”, said the voice. “The scientists create illusory ‘laws’ to measure anillusory universe.” There were no ‘laws’ of any kind because everything just is.“Do you think the Infinite needs ‘laws’ through which to express itself?” Thelaws of physics and mathematics and all the others that ‘govern’ the physicaland non-physical worlds were the creations of misguided mind. If the scientistsbelieve in such ‘laws’ that will be their experience. Not because the lawsexist, but because the scientists, and through them the people in general,believe them to exist and so they appear to. But this continues only untilsomeone comes along and changes the belief, the collective reality, and thensuch ‘laws’ cease to apply. It has been shown again and again that the beliefsof the scientists performing an experiment will affect the outcome of theexperiment. The nearest thing there is to a ‘law’ is this: what you believe iswhat you will see and experience. The voice explained how what we perceive to bea ‘solid’ world only exists because we believe it does. This ‘world’ is not ‘outthere’, it is ‘in here’ – in our minds. Scientific experiments have shown thatwe do not see up to 50%, and more, of what comes ‘through’ our eyes because itis filtered out by the temporal lobes of the brain on the basis of ourconditioned belief before it gets to the visual cortex, the point at which weactually ‘see’. It is our brain that sees, not our eyes. The eyes only provideinformation and it is the mind that decides what to make of it. So whatever ourmind/brain is conditioned to see or not see, it will. When we think we are in a‘conscious’ state going about our lives, we are, in fact, experiencing a dreamevery bit as much as those we experience in sleep. It’s just a different dream.Other levels of me might well be saying to each other right now that they havejust had this strange dream in which they were sitting at a computer writingsomething about drinking a plant and living in a Time Loop! What we think we‘see’ is just a dream. Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else isillusion. The Illuminati (i.e. ultimately the Matrix entity) use thisunderstanding of the mind to manipulate our sense of reality and maintain thepopulation in ongoing control. They tell people what they should see and so theydo. This is the fundamental role of the ‘norms’ (official ‘truths’) I havespoken and written about so widely. It is also why the authorities are desperateto remove or discredit those who challenge the norms because, in doing so, theyoffer another vision of possibility that allows people to ‘see’ a differentreality.image [../Images/00049.jpg] I ain’t got no body image [../Images/00049.jpg]Our bodies are holographic illusions that did not really exist in the way thatwe think we see and experience them, the voice said. We only have to eat anddrink because we and our bodies are programmed (through conditioning and theDNA) to believe that we do. We only have to breathe for the same reason. Yes, ifwe stopped breathing we would ‘die’, but this was not because we have to die. Itonly happened because our conditioned minds and bodies believe that will be theoutcome and so that is what they create. “Do you think the Infinite sits down todinner?” the voice said, “Do you think the Infinite has to breathe or it willdie?” So why, the voice asked, do those in the Time Loop? Answer: because theyidentify who they are and their sense of possibility with being a physical‘personality’ subordinate to illusory ‘laws’ and not with being what they reallyare – the Infinite ‘One’. The voice offered an example of the chasm betweenperceived reality and infinite self:> “Why do you need to fly around in aircraft? You are point A and you are point> B and you are everything in between. Why then do you need to use an aircraft> to fly through yourself?” ‘Law of the Wild’ – illuuuusion!The ‘laws’ of nature were also illusions, said the voice. “Why do people havesuch a problem understanding why a ‘loving God’ would create ‘laws’ of nature,laws of the wild, in which everything was based on killing and survival?” Thereappeared to be such a contradiction between ‘Divine love’ and the carnage andfear written into the very fabric of ‘nature’. But there was no contradiction,the voice said, because the ‘laws of nature’ were the creation of the Matrix,not the Infinite. “Do you think the Infinite, where you are now, would wish tosee anything suffer and live in fear, never mind create a structure in whichthis happened as a matter of course?” Nature was another holographic projectionthat was only ‘real’ because we were conditioned to believe it was. The ‘laws’of the natural world reflected the state of being of its creator, the Matrixentity; a state of fear and desperation to survive. There were, the voice said,some apparently beautiful expressions of nature on ‘Planet Earth’ and so long aswe realised they were illusions they could be enjoyed. But we should be carefulnot to become mesmerised by what we see on Earth or we would become like a mothhypnotised by a light, trapped by illusions that held us in a disconnectedstate. The message was enjoy what you see, but remember that what you ‘see’ ismerely what you think you see. An illusion can only control you when you thinkit is real.The new age MatrixIf you are interested in ‘New Age’ thought or some of the Eastern religions andphilosophies the next bit might be a bit of a surprise. The voice explained tome that the vast majority of ‘incarnate’ consciousness that left the ‘physical’body at what we call ‘death’ did not consciously reconnect with the Infinite.Instead it moved to other ‘non-physical’ dimensions of the Matrix. Consciousnessmay have withdrawn from the Time Loop, but it was still in the flytrap, albeit aless dense expression of it. Reincarnation was the cycle of consciousness movingin and out of the Time Loop from other levels of the Matrix. The concept ofreincarnation is another creation of the Matrix entity to hold consciousness ina cycle of servitude while believing it is ‘evolving’ through experience in linewith the New Age belief. “Do you think the Infinite has to reincarnate?” thevoice said. “Consciousness in the Matrix is also the Infinite, so why does thathave to reincarnate?” It doesn’t, it just believes that it does. As with thesaying “death is no cure for ignorance”, so it was the case that consciousnessin other levels of the Matrix was also trapped by illusions. When consciousnesswithdrew from the ‘physical’ body it did not become immediately re-enlightened.That depended on its reality. In the five-sense realm what we think we shouldsee is what we appear to see and experience. This, the voice explained, is whatalso happened in other frequencies of the Matrix. If consciousness left the bodybelieving totally that it was going to the heaven of Jesus and the Christianversion of God, this would be its experience; that is what it would ‘see’because that is what it believed it would see. It was the same with the otherreligious beliefs and the Matrix maintained a Christian ‘heaven’, Islamic‘heaven’, Hindu ‘heaven’ and Jewish ‘heaven’, etc. But these were nothing morethan figments of expectation. Only that which was free of conditioned belief wasable to transcend the vibratory illusions of the Matrix and become consciouslyone with the Infinite. Belief was the prison and other levels of the Matrix weredifferent levels of illusion. This meant that the overwhelming majority ofinformation ‘channelled’ through psychics in the Time Loop was fromconsciousness still caught in the Matrix. This might know more than those in theTime Loop density, but it was still in the web of illusion.I was shown a picture of people symbolically dropping from the sky onto afootpath across a field. The voice said that because consciousness in the Matrixwas caught in a cycle of moving in and out of the Time Loop through‘reincarnation’, they were not only conditioned by the beliefs of one ‘physical’lifetime. They were conditioned by endless experiences in the Time Loop andbetween these ‘physical’ excursions they were in another form of illusory state.So they were already conditioned even as they returned to the Time Loop realityfor still more conditioning. This was why humanity dropped into the conditioned,servile state so easily. They had been there many times before. As these wordswere being spoken, I saw the footpath being worn away by the trampling feetgoing over the same ground until the path looked like a sort of record groove.It went ever deeper and the figures walking the path went down and down into thedark ‘groove’ until they disappeared. “Is it any wonder that humans look up fortheir God?” the voice said. “It is the only place where they can see any light!”The voice told me how ‘New Age’ thought and some philosophies of the East andnative peoples were more enlightened than those of the purely Time Loopreligions and sciences of mainstream society. The ‘New Age’ reality understoodthat the ‘physical’ realm was only one dimension of existence and there weremany more beyond the vibrational walls of human senses. That was good, but whatwas not understood is that these other vibrating dimensions were still levels ofthe Matrix. They provided the constant ‘supply’ of consciousness to inhabit theTime Loop and generate the fear necessary to keep the Matrix ‘alive’. New Agebeliefs in a ‘Great White Brotherhood’ or an ‘Ashtar Command’ communicating withtheir chosen people were manipulations of the Time Loop from other levels of theMatrix. In fact, some were even communications from within the Time Loop plantedin the minds of the ‘psychic’ by mind-control and forms of technological‘telepathy’. When psychics, like those in stage shows and television, werecommunicating with the deceased relatives of the audience, they were contactinglevels of the Matrix very close to the Time Loop reality. Their other-frequencycommunicators may realise that there are other ‘worlds’ beyond the ‘physical’,but they were still in the realms of Matrix delusion. They communicated aboutgoing to ‘Halls of Learning’ in their non-physical world and how the Earth was aspiritual ‘university’ where people came to learn some tough lessons and workout their ‘karma’. This was illusion, the voice said, total illuuuuusion! “Doyou think the Infinite has to go to school to learn anything when it knowseverything there is to know?” the voice said. As for ‘karma’, the idea that youexperience what you have made others experience, the voice asked: “Why shouldthe Infinite have to experience what it has made itself experience?” The idea ofkarma was a Matrix manipulation to indoctrinate beliefs in the passage of ‘time’– it’s my karma from a past life or I am building karma for the future – and tomaintain people in a state of guilt and self-loathing. “Infinite Love does notjudge itself or loathe itself – these are illusions of disconnection.”What sign are you? Er, all of themThe voice then turned to astrology. Yes, it said, astrology appeared to ‘work’in the sense that certain types of ‘personality’ and traits could be predictedby the illusory ‘time’ and ‘place’ of a person’s birth in the ‘year’ (a classicillusion of the Time Loop). But why was this? Astrology ‘read’ the vibrationalfields of the Time Loop and while it could do this effectively in skilled hands,it was still a Matrix illusion that was based on division not Oneness.Astrology, said the voice, was a creation of the Matrix to manipulate people toidentify still more powerfully with their illusory ‘personality’ – I am aTaurus, a Leo, a Capricorn or whatever. It emphasised the idea of division, ofparts, not the whole. “Do you think the Infinite has its astrology read?” askedthe voice. “Do you think it consults a psychic about its ‘future’ or visits atarot card reader?” These were all identifications with the ‘physical’personality and such ‘forward’ predictions were peering down the Time Loop,that’s all. Psychics were extremely useful in showing people that ‘death’ is anillusion and the best of them – those connecting with the Infinite beyond theMatrix – could bring profound and mind-freeing information into the Time Loop,it said. But if people believed what the psychic or tarot reader said wouldhappen they could make it happen. What people believed was what they ‘saw’ andexperienced. In fact, we all have the power to create whatever reality wechoose. As I was hearing these words, I was shown a symbolic scene of theInfinite sitting at a table when someone brought the morning paper. The Infiniteturned to the list of birth signs on the astrology page and said: “Oh mygoodness, this will take me all morning because I am all of them.” Since thattime I have refused to identify with my ‘astrology’ and instead have identifiedonly with being all that is. If I don’t identify with being a ‘Taurus’ or‘Aries’ or ‘David Icke’ I begin to release myself from such influences andlimitations.The New Age and mainstream religions have a belief in the existence of ‘light’and ‘dark’. But there was no ‘light’ or ‘dark’, the voice said. These wereillusions. The belief that light was needed to balance the darkness was utterlymisguided and a belief in the existence of ‘light’ was as divisive as a beliefin the existence of ‘dark’. To believe in the ‘light’ means you must alsobelieve in the ‘dark’ and so belief in the ‘light’ also creates the illusion ofits perceived polarity, dark. Once more these were figments of disconnectedmind. Light and dark were illusions of the Matrix designed to cause division,conflict and fear. The Infinite was not light any more than it was dark. It wasthe balance of all things. It is not ‘good’ nor ‘bad’, ‘light’ nor ‘dark’, blacknor white, male nor female, it just is, the Oneness of all. Neither were thereany ‘demons’, the voice said. These were projections from the mind of the Matrixand the creation of human minds that accepted their existence. “Demons onlymanifest in minds that believe in them.” If Infinite Love was the only truth andeverything else was illusion, how could demons be anything, but illusions? Theywere holograms projected from the imagination of frightened and manipulatedminds. The idea that the ‘light’ must ‘fight’ the ‘dark’ and the demons onlyreinforced the belief in their perceived existence. There was no need to ‘fight’anything and those who did so were only giving what they fight more power byconfirming it was ‘real’. If people didn’t like their life experience theyshould perceive another reality and the manifestations of the present one woulddisappear. You don’t like your dream? Then dream something else.Why ask when you know?The voice emphasised that to free ourselves from the illusions of the Matrix wehad to identify with being the Infinite and not a fragment of mind stuffedinside a body. There was no David Icke, only Infinite consciousness. If werelate to being the Infinite and not some hologram dreamed into imaginary‘existence’, the Matrix will no longer control us. Stop asking questions, thevoice said, and start knowing the answers. It didn’t mean rhetorical questionsto illustrate a point, but those that come from the belief that we don’t knowsomething. “You are the Infinite so you know everything; do you think theInfinite asks questions when it knows all there is to know?” Whenever weidentified with limitation, ignorance and our illusory personality we weredisconnecting from the Infinite that knows all and is all. When we ask questionswe are accepting that we don’t know the answer. Would the Infinite do that? Stopasking the question and you will know the answer, the voice said, and, modifyinga line from the first Matrix movie, it added: “It’s not the question that drivesyou mad, it is asking it.” The psychiatrist, R.D. Laing, once said: “If I do notknow I know, I think I do not know.” People so lack confidence in themselvesthat they look to others to tell them what to think, but if they could freetheir minds of such doubt and limitation, they would simply ‘know’. Don’t thinkit, know it. Don’t ask it, know it.Dreaming our lives awaySince Brazil, I have understood more about the nature of our dream-worldreality. I walked along a beach on one occasion in an altered state on abeautiful sunny day thanks to ‘magic mushrooms’. It is the only other time Ihave taken anything to access an altered reality. The voice said to me: “Lookaround you, does it not seem like a dream? Does it not feel like a dream thatyou have in sleep?” It certainly did and later the ‘memory’ of the experiencewas extremely dream-like. Did it happen? Was it really all a dream? It was likewalking through a painting, a reality ‘bubble’, and laughter came far easierthan it does in the purely five-sense state. What I found interesting was theway that ‘this world’ phenomena could bring me out of the altered state in aninstant. I was walking along enjoying my expanded reality when I saw a policecar and began to think of the authoritarian system. Immediately I was out of myaltered state and back ‘here’. Later I began to think about something relatingto fear and the same happened. Whenever I checked the ‘time’ on my watch I waskicked out of the altered state as I related to the reality of the Time Loop.This allowed me to understand more of how the Time Loop/Matrix holds us in amanipulated reality and why the system is structured as it is.Interest in psychoactive substances exploded in the sixties with the use ofdrugs like LSD, but they largely became an escape from this reality rather thana bridge to a new one. I don’t want to escape this reality, I want to change it,and experiencing altered states can help us to understand the game we aredealing with. Those who have studied the effects of drugs like LSD from thisperspective have certainly learned a great deal more about reality than theywould otherwise have done. One is Stanislav Grof, the author of The HolotropicMind,4 and a former professor at John Hopkins University School of Medicine. Hewas a founder of the International Transpersonal Association and has developed ameans of taking people into altered states called Holotropic Breathwork. Grofwas a convinced materialist and atheist until he began studying the effects ofLSD in the 1950s as he sought to establish if there were any medical benefits.He was to continue his research for decades to come. In his first experience onLSD, he had what he called “an extraordinary encounter with my subconscious”. Herealised immediately that the unyielding ‘truth’ of the scientificestablishment, taught as fact in the schools and universities, was a fantasy:> “Traditional science holds the belief that organic matter and life grew from> the chemical ooze of the primeval ocean solely through the random interactions> of atoms and molecules. Similarly, it is argued that matter was organized into> living cells, and cells into complex multicellular organisms with central> nervous systems, solely by accident and ‘natural selection’. And somehow,> along with these explanations, the assumptions that consciousness is a> by-product of material processes occurring in the brain has become one of the> most important metaphysical tenets of the Western worldview. > “As modern science discovers the profound interactions between creative> intelligence and all levels of reality, this simplistic image of the universe> becomes increasingly untenable. The probability that human consciousness and> our infinitely complex universe could have come into existence through random> interactions of inert matter has aptly been compared to that of a tornado> blowing through a junkyard and accidentally assembling a 747 jumbo jet.” 5 Itzhak Bentov calls this mindset the ‘giraffe syndrome’ in his book, Stalkingthe Wild Pendulum. The term is inspired by the story of a man who sees a giraffefor the first time with its enormous height, neck and legs. It is such achallenge to his reality that he dismisses it as impossible and rejects the ideathat such an animal could exist. Stanislav Grof conducted some 4,000 LSDsessions and 20,000 with his Holotropic Breathwork, which involves a combinationof breathing techniques, sound, bodywork and artistic expression. This has, Grofsays, an “extraordinary potential for opening the way for exploring the entirespectrum of the inner world.” What fascinated him were the remarkable states ofconsciousness his subjects and clients have been able to access. They haveexperienced what it is like to be animals and plants, and they have describedintricate details of their genetics and behaviour that later proved to be 100%correct. They have even experienced being an atom or a blood cell, seeing insidethe Sun, and what it was like for them in the womb and the birth canal. Othershave said they became the consciousness of the whole cosmos and I know exactlywhat that is like myself. How was this possible? Because we are the cosmos, weare every cell and atom, and there is no ‘past’ or ‘future’. The five-senseprison – the Time Loop – disconnects us from the understanding that we are allOne. Indeed this perception of division is the prison.In these altered states beyond the five-senses we can regain our consciousconnection to the Infinite and experience any expression of the Infinite –anything in all existence. Look at the ocean. We give it different names likethe Pacific or the Indian, as we give ourselves names like Bill Jones or DavidIcke. But these ‘different’ oceans are the same water, as we are the sameconsciousness. So where is the ocean? Is it crashing on the coast of India? Isit lapping on a beach in Jamaica? Is it the Roaring Forties or the South ChinaSea? It is all of them and so it can experience all of them. We are the infiniteconsciousness that is everything. Where are we? Are we the tree in the garden?Are we the forest down the road? Are we the Sun or the sky? Are we thereflection we see in the mirror or the raindrops on our face? We are all of thembecause we are an expression of the seamless One and we can experience anyaspect of the seamless One that we are. We have been manipulated to believe weare isolated ‘individual’ droplets when we are the ocean. We are not even partof the ocean, we are the ocean. When you place a droplet back in the water,where does the droplet end and the ocean start? There is no division, thedroplet becomes the ocean. This knowledge has been communicated by theenlightened throughout human existence, but official science has denied itsvalidity. The ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, said that human beings were likepeople sitting in a cave always facing a wall. The universe was the shadowsprojected onto the wall, illusions that the people mistake for reality. The onlyreality or truth was the light – consciousness – that made the shadows possible.The ancient Vedic works of India make the same point. The eighth century Hindumystic, Shankara, said: “This entire universe of which we speak and think isnothing but Brahman [infinite consciousness]. Brahman dwells beyond the range ofMaya [illusion]. There is nothing else.” 6I had known this since my transformation began in Peru, but in the Amazon Iexperienced it like never before. People often say that the more they know, themore they realise there is to know. But once you reach the threshold ofunderstanding, the opposite is the case. The more you know, the less you need toknow, because it is all so simple: Infinite Love is the only truth – everythingelse is illusion.SOURCES > 1 Quoted from the Lankavatara Sutra by Ken Wilbur in the New Holographic> Paradigm (New Science Library, Boulder, Colorado, 1982), p 161> 2 Wilson Bryan Key, The Age of Manipulation (Madison Books, USA, 1989), p216> 3 Michael Talbot, The Holographic Universe (HarperPerennial, New York, 1992),> p 176> 4 Stanislav Grof, The Holotropic Mind (HarperSanFrancisco, 1990)> 5 The Holotropic Mind, p 5> 6 Shankara’s Crest Jewel of Discrimination (Vedanta Press, Hollywood,> California, 1975)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENOK, prove it! > In the long run it is far more dangerous to adhere to illusion than to face> what the actual fact is. > Physicist David Bohm It’s funny how the public and media are quite willing to accept lies pedalled bythe politicians without any demand for ‘proof’ and yet they insist on proof fromanyone challenging the official version of reality. The official ‘truth’ ofSeptember 11th is one such case. A schoolboy could take the story apart. Butwhen faced with other explanations for these events, and for life itself, thesame people who accept this crap without question scream: “Where’s the proof?”“That’s all very well, mate, but how can you convince me if you don’t have theevidence to prove it? I can’t believe what hasn’t been proved, can I?”Oh, but people do; and they go on doing so all their lives. Some points to makehere. First, why can’t we ‘feel’ and ‘know’ our reality instead of insistingthat the conditioned and manipulated mind must be the only arbiter of ‘truth’through the production of evidence that it believes to be ‘proof’? What is‘proof’, anyway? Proof is only that which the conditioned mind accepts to be so.Billions are convinced that the official version of 9/11 is true because of the‘proof’ revealed by the United States government. After all, didn’t they find apassport from one of the hijackers that had miraculously survived the fireballto be found in the street? Well, actually, no they didn’t because that was alie. But the FBI named the 19 hijackers didn’t they? No, they gave us 19 names,at least seven of which were found to be still alive. But they proved Bin Ladendid it, surely? I heard them say that. Yes, exactly, we heard them say it andnothing more. They produced no ‘proof’ of anything, only the repetition of theirfairy tale that billions accepted as ‘proof’. It was those using their ‘hearts’,their intuition, who knew something was very wrong with the official versioneven before any further investigation had begun. Does what I reported in thelast chapter ‘feel’ right intuitively even without ‘scientific’ support? Onlyyou know if it feels right to you or not; you don’t need some guy with a fancytitle and letters after his name to tell you what to think. What does your heartsay? That’s all that matters. Second, the last thing I am trying to do isconvince anyone of anything, that’s not my intention or desire at all. So whybother doing what I do? I want to understand what is going on and I believe itis right that everyone should have access to all information available and notjust the version that suits those in power. What people make of it is theirbusiness, not mine. Third, even for those who still demand ‘proof’ foreverything, there is an increasingly enormous amount of scientific support forthe themes of the last chapter, fantastic as they may have appeared to be atfirst hearing.Seeing is believing?“I can’t believe my eyes”, people say. Nor should they because the eyes don’tactually see. They are lenses that pass information to the visual cortex in thebrain and only there do we ‘see’. We ‘see’ with the brain, not with the eyes. “Ican’t believe my brain” or “I saw it with my own brain”, would be a better wayof putting it. On the way from the eyes to the visual cortex, the temporal lobesedit and reconstruct up to 50% and more of this information and we only ‘see’what the brain, with all its conditioned realities, decides it is seeing. In hisoutstanding book, The Holographic Universe, Michael Talbot writes about the workof neurophysiologist Karl Pribram and others:> “Pribram discovered that the visual information a monkey receives via its> optic nerves does not travel directly into its visual cortex, but is first> filtered through other areas of its brain. Numerous studies have shown that> the same is true of human vision. Visual information entering our brains is> edited and modified by our temporal lobes before it is passed on to our visual> cortices. Some studies suggest that less than 50 per cent of what we ‘see’ is> actually based on information entering our eyes. The remaining 50 per cent> plus is pieced together out of our expectations of what the world should look> like (and perhaps other sources such as reality fields). The eyes may be the> visual organs, but it is the brain that sees.” 1 This is the journey of information or ‘light’, as some call it, when it passesfrom eye to brain: Light enters the eye by passing through the outer,transparent layer called the cornea; it goes on through the pupil, which getsbigger or smaller to allow in more or less light depending on the circumstances.This process is controlled by the coloured part of the eye, the iris; from thepupil/iris it goes to the lens to be focussed; next stop is the vitreous humor,a jelly-like substance behind the lens; now the light/information strikes theretina that captures the ‘image’ like the film in a camera. But this imagerecorded on the retina is upside-down and two-dimensional; it goes on to theoptic nerve that sends the image through the brain to the occipital lobe. Onlynow does the brain re-assemble the upside-down, two-dimensional image deliveredby the eyes into the form we think we are seeing. Scientists say the flip from2-D to 3-D is possible because the brain takes light/information from both eyesand combines them into one 3-D image, much like one of those 3-D picture viewersyou can buy.2 I think it is more sophisticated than that, however.What a journey for everything we ‘see’. Given these facts it is clear that our‘physical’ reality is not constructed ‘out there’, but ‘in here’. It is likelooking out of a window and telling someone a version of what you see that suitsyour beliefs rather than what is really happening. As studies have shown, forexample, men and women have a real problem communicating accurately with eachother because what one says the other does not hear. A process of editing goeson in which they each ‘hear’ whatever supports their conditioned belief andprejudice about the other. I have seen television programmes in which theyfilmed a conversation, asked each participant what the other had said, and thenplayed back the recording. They have been stunned by how inaccurately they heardwhat was said to them or the tone in which they spoke to the other. You willfind the same in any argument between people with rigidly held beliefs. Rememberthe polls of the American public that revealed how many of them believedbreathtaking nonsense about 9/11, the Iraq war and the finding and use ofchemical and biological weapons? Steve Kull, director of the Program onInternational Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, said the level ofmisinformation suggested that some Americans may be avoiding having anexperience of “cognitive dissonance”. In short, their beliefs were in conflictwith the facts and so it is their beliefs, not the facts, which dictate theirreactions and responses. Implanting belief is everything to the Illuminatibecause it is through belief that we manifest our reality.What we don’t ‘see’, we make upThe eyes have a blind spot where the optic nerve connects to the eye in themiddle of the retina. Whatever we may be looking at we cannot see anything fromthat part of the eye, but the brain weaves the picture together from theinformation available and fills in the ‘hole’. Reality is only what we areprogrammed to believe it is. What we believe we are ‘seeing’ is what we see andit is the same with all five-senses. The phenomena of phantom limb syndrome whenpeople have limbs removed but can still feel them is another example of thefive-senses reacting to the brain’s sense of reality. In the first Matrix movie,the woman known as the ‘Oracle’ tells the Neo character not to worry about thevase. What vase, he asks? As he speaks, a vase falls to the floor next to him.He is very apologetic, but the Oracle says: “What’s really going to cook yournoodle is would it have happened if I hadn’t said anything?” We are beingconstantly programmed to accept realities that suit the agenda because once wedo those realities can manifest. I wonder how many times people have warnedchildren about something to such an obsessive extent that the child’s mind hasabsorbed that reality and created it. “I was always telling him he would have anaccident if he wasn’t careful and now he has.” The same process is used on thecollective mind of humanity by the Illuminati to manifest the reality they wantus to have. When I asked Credo Mutwa why even more people did not see theReptilian entities, he said it was because they are so at odds with humanreality that the mind removes them from what it ‘sees’. The mystic, SriAurobindo Ghose, also said that most humans possess a “mental screen” that keepsus from seeing behind “the veil of matter”.Daughter or no daughterIn The Holographic Universe, Michael Talbot recalls an experience he had thatconfirms what I am suggesting here. He says that in the mid 1970s his fatherhired a professional hypnotist to entertain a group of friends. One of thosechosen to be hypnotised was a man called Tom and this was the first time he hadmet the hypnotist. What stage hypnotists do is to programme a person to believethey are seeing something or doing something that is pure invention. We have allseen them make people believe they are seeing the audience naked or they are adog or a mouse or whatever. Michael Talbot recounts how this hypnotist made Tombelieve there was a giraffe in the room and eat a raw potato believing it to bean apple. All this is confirmation that the brain sees and experiences what itis programmed to believe it sees and experiences. But the most profound part ofthe story came when Tom was brought back to ‘waking’ consciousness. Just beforethe hypnotist ended the formal trance state, he told Tom that when he awoke hewould not be able to see his daughter, Laura. The hypnotist asked Laura to standright in front of her father so that when he opened his eyes he would be lookingat her stomach. Tom was asked if he could see his daughter. “No”, he replied.Laura was even giggling, but it made no difference. The hypnotist hid behindLaura and held something against the small of her back. To see it, Tom wouldhave had to see through his daughter. The hypnotist asked Tom what he washolding in his hand and, leaning forward looking at the stomach of his daughter,he said: “A watch.” He was asked if he could read the inscription and, squintingto read the small writing, he did so. The hypnotist revealed that he was indeedholding a watch with that inscription.3 Tom’s mind had been programmed tobelieve he could not see his daughter and so he didn’t. More than that he couldsee what was behind her. How is this possible? We construct our reality ‘inhere’ not ‘out there’.With this knowledge we are at the cutting edge of understanding how theIlluminati, and through them, the Matrix, controls billions of people from(illusory) cradle to grave. They programme us to believe a version of ourselves,life, possibility and the world, and this belief constructs our reality in linewith that indoctrinated blueprint. We only ‘see’ what we are conditioned to seeand edit out anything that contradicts it. For instance, to advocates of war thestatement “I want peace” is saying “I want to let ‘terrorists’ and ‘dictators’do what they like.” Or to supporters of unfettered industrialism the statement,“We must protect the planet”, is saying “We should go back to living in tentsand caves and working the land with horses and ploughs.” Each side does not hearwhat is being said because their minds edit the message to fit their beliefs. Ihave witnessed many exchanges like this and everything becomes polarised – justas the Illuminati want. Polarisation = division and conflict; and division andconflict = divide and rule. They want conflicting, rigidly held beliefs, forthis reason. The Illuminati need the ‘Left’ as much as they need the ‘Right’ and‘Centre’; they need the ‘poor’ as they need the ‘rich’; they need the ‘black’ asthey need the ‘white’ and they need the ‘fors’ as they need the ‘againsts’. Ihave been writing all these years that the Illuminati don’t much care what youfiercely believe so long as you fiercely believe something because they can thenplay you off against others who fiercely belief the (apparent) opposite.Holographic illusionThe official ‘truth’ of mainstream ‘science’ is in disarray. Its ludicrouslynarrow vision of possibility – this ‘world’ is all there is – has been facedwith so many basic questions it cannot begin to answer that its credibility isin tatters among anyone with a mind still reporting for duty. The reason it issilent in the face of such questions (like why they can’t locate the mind in thebrain) is because its foundation assumptions about consciousness and reality arenonsense. It is obsessed with the five-senses and cannot see beyond them. Giventhat we are dealing with infinity, five-sense ‘science’ must always be no-sense‘science’. It is, as Stanislav Grof puts it, “a conceptual straightjacket”.4 Theso-called ‘paranormal’ has always been dismissed as a fantasy simply becausesuch phenomena is unexplainable within its arrogant and juvenile view ofpossibility. Adding to its plight has been the brilliant work of thosescientists researching the realms of quantum physics beyond the frequency rangeof the five-senses. From this research has come the confirmation that whatpsychics, mystics, native peoples and freethinkers have been saying forthousands of years is correct. There are infinite realms of existence and theyare all part of one indivisible whole. The five-sense reality is only one ofthem. Most intriguing, given what I was told in those ayahuasca sessions, is thefast emerging evidence that what we think we see as buildings, people, forestsand lakes are actually three-dimensional holographic illusions conjured intothat reality by our own minds. Albert Einstein said:> “We must remember that we do not observe nature as it actually exists, but> nature exposed to our methods of perception. The theories determine what we> can or cannot observe.” 5 Or, as he also said: “Reality is an illusion, albeit a persistent one.” Amongthose at the forefront of this research are people like David Bohm, theworld-renowned quantum physicist at the University of London, who worked withEinstein, and Karl Pribram, a neurophysiologist at Stanford University. Manyothers have picked up their themes and published their own findings. Bohm andPribram came to basically the same conclusions even though they arrived fromdifferent directions and did not correspond until their original ideas wereformed. This research states that our ‘physical’ reality is made up of hologramsthat give the illusion of three-dimensional objects when they are, in fact,nothing more than frequency patterns. The voice in the ayahuasca session saidthat our minds create these holographic illusions in a slightly different way tothe holograms made by human technology, but the principle was the same.Holograms are made by directing a laser onto a photographic plate (Figure 44).Lasers are used because they produce a stable, focussed beam known as ‘coherentlight’ and project a single frequency. Coherent light is that which holds anarrow, even beam over long distances and does not expand like the light from atorch, for example. The laser is directed at the film through a semi-transparentmirror. Some of the light is deflected away in another direction and onto theobject you want to film. Now you have the laser light pointing at the plate(known as the reference beam) and the part deflected away onto the object (knownas the working beam). This working beam, carrying the vibrational image of theobject in question, is then also directed onto the photographic plate. When ithits the plate it ‘collides’ with the reference beam – its ‘other half’ and thiscreates what is known as an interference pattern between the two. You can likenthe principle to throwing two stones in a pond and seeing how the two waveformations collide and interfere with each other. They form a wave pattern thatis a wave representation of the two stones, where they fell and at what speed.The interference pattern imprinted on the photographic plate looks much like thewaves in the pond. It is a series of lines that appear to be random andincomprehensible (Figure 45). But when you shine the same type of laser lightupon this pattern suddenly an apparently three-dimensional image of thephotographed object comes into view (Figures 46 and 47). Immediately when youturn off the light the holographic image disappears because it is only anillusion. A point to stress here is that the same type of laser light thatcreates the interference or wave pattern is also required to manifest thepatterns as a three-dimensional holographic illusion. This is what we do withdifferent parts of the mind interacting with each other. Like the laser, twoparts of the mind interact to form the wave (thought) patterns and the same mindobserves them into holographic illusion (Figure 48). You might call this form ofcommunication ‘visual telepathy’. Remember, too, how the brain (a ‘physical’computer for the mind) takes light/information from the eyes and turns a 2-Dimage on the retina into 3-D image that we ‘see’. It is turning 2-D wavepatterns into 3-D holographic illusions that we think is the world ‘around’ us.In truth, it is all happening within us as we turn wave patterns into holograms,as symbolised in Figure 49.Image [../Images/00050.jpg]Figure 44: Holograms are made by using two parts of the same laser light. Onehalf (reference beam) goes almost directly to the photographic plate and theother (working beam) is diverted onto the subject. When this working beam isdiverted again onto the print it forms an “interference pattern” with thereference beam. If a laser is shone upon this pattern it creates a 3-Dholographic picture of the subject Image [../Images/00051.jpg]Figure 45: The wave or ‘interference’ pattern on a holographic print. It seemsrandom and meaningless until a laser light is shone on the pattern and ahologram is formed. Image [../Images/00052.jpg]Figure 46: A holographic 3-D picture created by shining a laser onto the wavepattern Image [../Images/00053.jpg]Figure 47: Holograms can look as ‘solid’ as we do, but you can put your handright through them because they are illusions – just like we are! The ‘television’ brainWhat the voice in Brazil told me was that our beliefs and sense of reality areprojected as ‘thought fields’ that are akin to the interference patterns on aholographic film. Our thought waves create frequency patterns in the unseen,‘non-physical’ subconscious realms and by observing these patterns with ourconscious minds we turn them into apparently three-dimensional holographicforms. We both create the frequency patterns and, by observing those patterns,manifest the hologram – just as the laser does. Observed and observer are one,created and creator are one. As with the light shining on the holographic film,the ‘3-D’ image only appears to exist when we are observing it (‘shining’ on it,you might say). When we are not observing these vibrating thought fields, theyare frequency patterns and not the apparently three dimensional images we thinkwe are seeing. It is the same principle as a television set that turnselectromagnetic frequencies broadcast from a transmitter into pictures we canrecognise. Whenever you think you are seeing something ‘real’ you are actuallywatching holographic television and your brain/lower mind is the TV set. Idelude myself, therefore I am.Image [../Images/00054.jpg]Figure 48: Subconscious mind creates the wave or thought patterns and theconscious mind ‘observes’ them into the holographic illusions that we take to bethe ‘real’ world. It is only an illusion, a figment of our implanted belief andimagination Image [../Images/00055.jpg]Figure 49: If we could see the ‘world’ before it enters our eyes it would be amass of wave patterns – thought fields. Through the collective mind we transformthese fields into an agreed ‘reality’ – the landscape we think we see all aroundus. In fact, it is within us, within our own minds When you see a holographic picture it seems to be 3-D and occupying ‘space’, butit is not. It is a virtual reality: an illusion. The image is not occupying‘space’; it is an interference pattern on a film. What we think we are seeingwith our ‘eyes’ as 3-D images occupying ‘space’ all around us, are just as mucha virtual reality. There are no 3-D images ‘out there’, only the frequencypatterns that our mind and brain decode into holographic illusions ‘in here’. Iremember a really boring hymn they sang at my school called “God be in my Head”.Well, symbolically everything is in your ‘head’ or, rather, mind. It is likelooking out of the window, seeing a frequency pattern, and saying: “Hey, there’sMrs Smith running for the bus.” Quantum physics has long discovered that atoms,the so-called building blocks of the ‘physical’ world, are themselves made up ofsmaller and smaller ‘particles’ like electrons. Scientists have established thatelectrons and other sub-atomic particles can either express themselves as a‘wave’ form (non-physical) or as a particle (apparently ‘physical’). And, getthis: they only manifest as particles – ‘physical’ – when we are looking atthem!! Otherwise they are always in wave-form. Michael Talbot writes in TheHolographic Universe:> “For [Karl] Pribram, this synthesis made him realize that the objective world> does not exist, at least not in the way we are accustomed to believing. What> is ‘out there’ is a vast ocean of waves and frequencies and reality looks> concrete to us only because our brains are able to take this holographic blur> and convert it into sticks and stones and other familiar objects that make up> our world … > “ … In other words, the smoothness of a piece of fine china and the feel of> beach sand beneath our feet are really just elaborate versions of the phantom> limb syndrome. > “According to Pribram this does not mean there aren’t china cups and grains of> beach sand out there. It simply means that a china cup has two very different> aspects to its reality. When it is filtered through the lens of our brains it> manifests as a cup. But if we could get rid of our lenses, we’d experience it> as an interference pattern. Which is real and which is illusion? ‘Both are> real to me,’ says Pribram, ‘or, if you want to say, neither of them is real’.”> 6 Appropriately, it was the discoveries by the Frenchman Jean B. J. Fourier in the18th century that led to television, the discovery of holograms and the researchthat revealed how the brain is actually a frequency decoder. Fourier developed aprocess called Fourier transforms. This is a mathematical method of convertingpatterns into simple wave forms and back again, so providing the potential for atelevision camera to convert pictures into electromagnetic frequencies and thetelevision to convert them back again. Picking up this theme, Dennis Gabor won aNobel Prize for his development of holographic technology, starting in the late1940s. He turned a three-dimensional object into a wave/frequency pattern onphotographic film and then converted it back to a 3-D holographic image in theway I have described. At the end of the 1970s, research by Russell and KarenDeValois, two neurophysiologists at Berkley University, revealed compellingevidence, since supported by countless other scientists across the world, thatthe brain is decoding frequency patterns and turning them into holographicimages that we ‘see’. The same Fourier system is involved in the way the braindoes this. It was already known that the brain cells in the visual cortex, fromwhere we ‘see’, react to different frequency patterns and activate according tothe type of frequencies they received. For a century it had been known that theear was a frequency decoder and experiments by Georg von Bekesy, another NobelPrize winner, had long confirmed how the skin responded to frequencies. Otherresearch strongly suggests, as the voice in Brazil told me, that all thefive-senses are the same. They are decoding frequencies into sight, hearing,taste, smell and touch. As the Morpheus character said in the first Matrixmovie:> “What is real? How do you define real? If you are talking about what you can> feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see then real is merely> electrical signals interpreted by your brain.” It goes even further than that. It depends on the point from which you want toobserve the illusion. At one level, the brain is a hologram acting like acomputer interpreting reality. But at a higher point of observation, there is nobrain!! That’s just another illusion.Image [../Images/00056.jpg]Figure 50: The atoms that make up our ‘solid’ world are virtually ‘empty’ tofive-sense reality. You could hardly find anything less ‘solid’ than an atom. Sohow can these be the building blocks of the ‘solid’ physical world? They can’t;it’s all illusion The wall is ‘solid’? Sorry, impossibleThere is no such thing as ‘empty space’ (unless you believe there is!).Physicists calculate that every cubic centimetre of ‘empty space’ (i.e. thatwhich our ‘physical’ senses cannot ‘see’) contains more energy than is containedin all the matter of the known (‘seen’) universe.7 Some empty space, eh? Theastrophysicist and author, Giuliana Conforto, notes that we cannot ‘see’ 99.5%of the mass in the known universe. Space only appears ‘empty’ because the energyis beyond the frequency range of the five-senses and it is in these unseenrealms that the thought fields are constructed that we turn into holographicillusions of three dimensional ‘solidity’. The realm of the five-senses is likethe crest of a wave, while the unseen realms are the infinite ocean from whichthis reality is made manifest through thought. I have quoted in almost everybook the words of the brilliant, and much missed, American comedian, Bill Hicks.He was a man who experienced many times the kind of ‘trip’ I experienced inBrazil. Bill said: “Matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration; weare all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively; there’s no suchthing as death, life is just a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.”Superb. But while the five-sense reality is dense compared with the rest of theocean, it is not solid or anything like. It just appears to be.The physical realm is constructed, scientists say, with atoms. These are namedfrom the work of an ancient Greek called Democritus, who made the first knownclaim that matter was made up of tiny particles that he called atoms. This wassome 2,500 years ago in our measurement of ‘time’ when the materialist view ofthe world was founded. The science establishment did, however, dismiss this ideaof atoms for many centuries and it was not revived until 1808. Today we knowthat atoms contain even smaller particles consisting of a nucleus (made ofprotons and neutrons) orbited by electrons. The inside of the atom with theelectrons orbiting the nucleus while spinning themselves is similar to theprinciple of planets orbiting the Sun, though not the same. The point I ammaking is this: the atoms that comprise ‘solid’, ‘physical’ matter are not solidor physical at all. They are overwhelmingly ‘empty’ from a ‘physical’ senseperspective (Figure 50). As one writer put it: if the atom was the size of acathedral, the nucleus etc., would be about the size of a ten cent piece. Therest is ‘empty’ to the perception of the five-sense world and is not in theleast ‘solid’. So how can something that is not in any way solid be the buildingblock of a solid reality? Of course, it can’t. The illusion of solidity is justthat – illusion. Amit Goswami writes in The Self Aware Universe: “You can’t besure if all things are made of atoms – it’s an assumption. Suppose all things,including atoms, are made of consciousness instead!” 8 Itzhak Bentov makes thispoint very well in his book, Stalking the Wild Pendulum. He explains what wouldbe seen with a microscope capable of observing single atoms and the subatomicrealm:> “Let us now magnify a piece of bone … we see the atoms weaving back and forth> like a field of ripe wheat blown by the wind. They move in unison and in> beautiful rhythm. Acoustical energy is flowing through the crystal. > “Next we focus on the atoms. At first they appear as little shadowy balls> vibrating about fixed points in the molecule. As we magnify, we see less and> less. The electron shell has somehow dissolved, and we are looking at a> vacuum. As we further magnify we see something tiny moving about. We focus on> what we suspect is the nucleus of the atom, located in this vast space within> the atom. If we take the diameter of the nucleus of a hydrogen atom to be 1> mm. then the diameter of the electron orbit will about 10 meters, a ratio of 1> to 10,000, and the intervening space is vacuum. > “As we zero in and further magnify the vibrating nucleus, it seems to be> dissolving. We are looking at some shadowy pulsation; some more magnification> and the nucleus is almost gone. We are sensing the pulsation of some energy;> it seems to be a rapidly pulsating field. But where did the bone go? We> thought that we were looking at a solid piece of matter! > “Well, it seems that the real reality – the microreality, that which underlies> all our solid, good, common-sense reality – is made up, as we have just> witnessed, of a vast empty space filled with oscillating fields! Many> different kinds of fields, all interacting with each other. The tiniest> disturbance in one field carries over into the others. It’s an interlocked web> of fields, each pulsating at their own rate but in harmony with the others,> their pulsations spreading out farther and farther throughout the cosmos.” 9 Nothing adds to the belief in the ‘physical body’ more than the apparentsolidity of bone, but bone is not solid at all. Bentov goes on to say that apowerful enough disturbance by one vibrating field can knock others from theirharmonious rhythm and the irregularity spreads to disturb the neighbouringfields. This is how the disharmonious vibrations caused by stress and trauma cancause ‘physical’ disease – dis-ease – by disrupting the vibrational harmony ofthe body hologram. When we are emotionally charged, upset or stressed we stopthinking straight for the same reason. The emotional field disrupts the mental.This also explains why those who work with electromagnetic technology, live nearor under power lines, or use mobile phones can suffer more than others fromcertain cancers etc. These technology fields disrupt the harmony of the hologramand the thought fields from which they manifest. Pollution, nuclear waste andradiation have the same effect of vibrationally imbalancing the body hologram.But, as always, only if we think they do!The Trinity?Itzhak Bentov points out in Stalking the Wild Pendulum that the interaction oftwo frequencies produces a third frequency that is much slower than the othertwo.10 Is this the process by which higher frequencies of thought interact toproduce this lower frequency, the five-sense world? Is this the real origin ofthe obsession with the symbol of the trinity through the ages, likeChristianity’s Father, Son and Holy Ghost? Are these really codes for twovibrations interacting to create a third, denser one – the ‘son’ of the othertwo? Maybe and how appropriate that one of the main characters in the Matrixmovies is called Trinity. The Swedish mystic, Emanuel Swedenborg, said that ouruniverse is created, and held together as a ‘physical’ reality, by two wave-likeflows, one from what he called ‘heaven’ and the other from our own ‘soul’, as heput this. Dr George F. Dole, a professor of theology at the Swedenborg School ofReligion in Massachusetts, wrote:> “If we put those images together, the resemblance to the hologram is striking.> We are constituted by the intersection of two flows – one direct, from the> divine, and one indirect, from the divine via our environment. We can view> ourselves as interference patterns because the inflow is a wave phenomenon,> and we are where the waves meet.” 11 Reality is created from endless sources of ‘wave’ or thought, but the principleis correct. Two forces interact to create a third. This is the trinity. Putanother way, father and mother create a denser ‘son’. But enough about GeorgeBush.Life is but a dreamCharles Tart, a professor of psychology at the Davis Campus of the University ofCalifornia, asked two skilled hypnotists called Anne and Bill to hypnotise eachother. He was trying to synchronise their two hypnotic realities and that iswhat happened. The two, both graduate students, found themselves experiencingthe same ‘place’, a beautiful beach and ocean. They swam together, studied thesame crystalline rocks, and ‘talked’ to each other even though they were notspeaking in this reality, from where Tart was observing them. They laterrecalled that this hypnotic dream was every bit as ‘real’ as their experience intheir ‘awakened state’ and included five-sense-type sensations although theirhypnotic world was more pliable and less dense than this one. During theirexperience they often forgot to manifest bodies for themselves and floatedaround only as faces and heads. On one occasion when Bill asked Anne to take hishand she had to ‘think’ her own ‘hand’ into ‘existence’.12 That may soundamazing, but what they experienced was no different, except in density, from the‘world’ we think is ‘real’. I experienced something very similar to this when Iwalked on a beach in an altered state of consciousness. Interestingly, thenearest psychological state to the hypnotic state is the waking state! We areliving in a dream just as much as we are when we sleep and what we call ourmemory is our ability to remember our dreams. The difference is whether we knowit is a dream or believe it to be real. If you drive a car over a cliff in thisfive-sense dream world you are dead because that is the accepted reality of thisrealm. Do the same in a dream you know is a dream and you will wake up unharmed.The interchange between the Neo character and the enlightened little boy in thefirst Matrix movie encapsulates the nature of our reality:> “Do not try to bend the spoon; that is impossible, only try to realise the> truth.” > “What truth?” > “There is no spoon … it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.” This is like the story of the two monks debating about the movement of a flag inthe wind. “The flag is moving”, said one. “No, the wind is moving”, said theother. A third, passing by and hearing the conversation, said: “The flag is notmoving. The wind is not moving. Your mind is moving.” The nature of our‘physical’ dream is dictated by our beliefs, which project thought fields thatwe observe into holographic illusion. We project the frequency pattern with thethoughts of our non-physical minds and our conscious minds decode them into thethree-dimensional holographic illusions we take to be real. That’s how we createour ‘seeing’ reality and that’s how the illusion works. The Robin Williamsmovie, What Dreams May Come (PolyGram, 1998), offers an excellent visualportrayal of what I am talking about here. It shows how, after ‘death’, wecreate our own reality with our thoughts and beliefs. What needs to beemphasised, however, is that we are also doing that in this five-sense realm.What is free will?Something to emphasise here. The conscious mind is not the one ultimately incontrol of events, except in the way it decodes thought patterns intoholographic 3-D in accordance with its sense of reality. The subconscious is themain source of human response and behaviour, not the conscious that thinks it ismaking the decisions. Experiments have revealed that the signals in the brainnecessary to move a limb, open the mouth or take any ‘physical’ action, beginsome one and a half seconds before the conscious mind makes the ‘decision’ to doit. Benjamin Libet and Bertram Feinstein, neurophysiologists at Mount ZionHospital in San Francisco, confirmed this theme in their experiments. They askedpeople to press a button when they were touched. The outcome was that the brainreacted to the touch in 0.0001 of a second and the button was pressed in 0.1 ofa second. The amazing part, however, is that the person was not aware of feelingthe touch or pressing the button for a full half a second. Other tests haverevealed that the reaction to stimuli registers in the human energy field (thelocation of mind) even before it does in the brain. The subconscious makes thedecisions and, while the conscious level can have an input here and there, it isbasically the observer and experiencer.Psychiatrist Carl Jung coined the word “synchronicity” to describe the amazingcoincidences that happen to us, which are thousands or millions of times beyondstatistical chance. It is as if some ‘force’ was guiding such events. Well itis. In my view, synchronicity is the conscious mind observing what thesubconscious has decided will happen. “Going with the flow” is going with thewill of the subconscious; fighting the flow is fighting the will of thesubconscious. Do we really have free-will? Yes, but not necessarily at theconscious level of the five-senses, except, that is, for what we choose toobserve into holographic illusion from the thought fields placed before us. Theconscious and subconscious were the two ‘different’ levels of me, of which I wasso aware on that Wogan Show interview in 1991. My conscious levelobserver/experiencer was in turmoil while my subconscious was perfectly calmbecause it knew where it was all leading. I went on the show in the first place,despite the consequences my conscious mind knew would ensue, because mysubconscious was making the decisions. Physicist David Bohm says:> “Every action starts from an intention in the implicate [non-’physical’]> order. The imagination is already the creation of the form; it already has the> intention and the germs of all the movements needed to carry it out. And it> effects the body and so on, so that as creation takes place in that way from> the subtler levels of the implicate order, it goes through them until it> manifests in the explicate” [five-senses].13 This fits the information given to me by the voice in Brazil. It said the Matrixhad been created by the collective subconscious, and the conscious mind had beenimprisoned by the illusions thus created. The Matrix took on a life of its ownwhen it accessed an ‘energy source’ of its own – ‘fear’ generated by theconscious and subconscious mind that was caught in an illusion believing it tobe ‘real’. This ‘self-aware fear’, the Matrix, then also trapped the collectivesubconscious in illusion. As I have detailed at length in other books, theIlluminati’s secret language is that of symbolism and metaphor. Global societyand the media are awash with such hidden messages that are called ‘subliminal’or ‘below threshold’. They are the language of the subconscious and theIlluminati know that if they programme the subconscious with a reality theywant, the five-sense level will act it out. It is the subconscious that theIlluminati target most of all.Mass hypnosisWe are further conditioned to see what we are told to see by the very ‘norms’ ofsociety I have been emphasising in book after book. Hypnosis comes in endlessforms. It does not have to stand on a stage or hold a swinging pocket watch.Hypnosis of the type I am talking about is the programming of the conscious andsubconscious mind to believe a falsehood to such an extent that this is what it‘sees’. The hypnotist is implanting a false reality into your mind. Those tenwords encapsulate the real motive behind the ‘education’ system, official‘science’, the media, government pronouncements, and all the other sources ofofficial ‘information’ with which the human brain and mind is deluged every day– “the hypnotist is implanting a false reality into your mind”. I have exposedthis process in detail in other books and this is what these institutions are:hypnotists. This is especially true of ‘education’ and the media, and, mostparticularly, television. These constant influences programme our sense of‘reason’ to such an extent that we believe the illusion to be real. In one ofthe books of Carlos Castaneda, he quotes his shaman source, Don Juan, as saying:> “We are perceivers. We are awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity.> We are boundless … We, or rather our reason, forget [this] and thus we entrap> the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in> our lifetime.” 14 From the moment we become conscious as a child, the programming of our realitybegins. In fact it begins in the womb through the mother. We already start witha ‘body’ that carries its inherited reality programming through the DNA and thisusually includes genetic subservience to authority and a sense of “I am smalland insignificant”. I see the body as like a bucking horse that ourconsciousness has to subdue and harmonise by expressing its reality over thatinherited genetically by the body or ‘horse’. I reckon the minds of vast numbersof people are prisoners of their body’s genetic programming and responses. The‘horse’ is in control of their actions and reactions, not the ‘rider’, the mind.In such people an inherited genetic trait like alcoholism will be repeated intheir own experience. Those with consciousness more powerful than the geneticprogramming will be able to override it and avoid the repetition. When I waswalking in an altered state on the ‘magic mushrooms’, I came across a horseboxparked in the street and alongside was a horse and rider. The voice said to methat the analogy of the horse and rider, body and consciousness, was valid. Itsaid that the hologram, the 3-D illusion, has a fantastic capacity for storinginformation, a fact that science has confirmed. The voice said that ‘space’,like ‘time’, was an illusion. Something as ‘small’ as the DNA had the capacityto store astonishing amounts of information in the form of vibrational codesbecause there is no ‘space’ in terms of ‘big’ and ‘small’. There is onlyeverywhere. A pin-head and the infinite are actually the same. The voice saidthat the programming of a body hologram – its “library of experience” – ispassed on through the DNA to its successors in the line. The body hologramscontain all the information accumulated by all the expressions of that DNA sincethe line ‘began’. These genetic ‘lines’ do not exist as ‘past’ to ‘future’, butin different realities of the infinite NOW. Imagine, the voice said, that theincoming consciousness has to cope with all those inherited programmes, beliefsand assumptions of reality. The voice said: “Do you wonder any longer why peopleare so easy to manipulate when they inherit that genetic programming to startwith?” It said that most people expended so much energy coping with theinherited responses, reactions, desires and demands of their body hologram thatthey had little left to look up and see beyond the illusion. With greatsynchronicity as I later walked back along the same street, the horse was beingled into the horsebox. “You are looking at a profound symbol of the humancondition”, said the voice. “Human consciousness is trapped in the ‘horse’ andthe ‘horse’ is trapped in the ‘box’ – human consciousness is trapped in the‘body’ and the ‘body’ is trapped in the Time Loop and the Matrix.” How we canbreak free will be discussed later.This inherited programming through the body hologram and the effect of mind on‘body’, explains why many people who have been regressed to ‘past lives’ haverealised that the experiences of a previous ‘incarnation’ are symbolised bytraits in their body. Someone who had his throat cut might have an unexplainablescar-like line on the throat or a person who had his hand smashed by torturemight have a deformed hand in this ‘life’. These are mind and body memoriesmanifesting in the hologram. It is important to remember this body programmingwhen you are in altered states of consciousness because your mind and body mightnot be on the same page of perceived reality. Your mind may jump out of thewindow shouting “I can fly”, but half way down your body says: “Not with me youbloody can’t.” Aaaaahhhhhhhh!Inter-generational hypnosisIn childhood we are subjected to the programming of our parents who instil theirown conditioned reality upon us. From the age of four or five this is compoundedmassively by school and ‘education’, which is little more than legalised childabuse. The abuse, that is, of the child’s mind and sense of reality. What doesthe ‘education’ system actually do? It indoctrinates a false reality day afterday throughout the most critical period of a child’s development by (a) poundingout the official version of science, history, possibility and impossibility, andall the rest; and (b) by insisting that only by repeating back this bollocks inexams will you progress within the Illuminati system that controls ‘education’.For many this indoctrination at school is followed by college or university‘education’ in which the same process is repeated at a higher level. Educationis not involved in developing self-awareness, it merely prepares young people todo the jobs that will serve the system. Real ‘education’ is actually unlearningthe indoctrination of official ‘education’. Constantly underpinning these falserealities throughout our lives is the conditioning of the same ‘norms’ and‘truths’ by the media, most powerfully via the resident hypnotist in the cornerof the room. “Mom, where do I learn about the meaning of life?” – “Oh shut upand watch TV.” – “OK, mom, Zzzzzzzzzzzz.” Add to all this the fact that almosteveryone around you will have been through the same programming and accept thesame realities, plus there is the peer pressure throughout your life to conformto the norms even if you don’t want to. This produces a network ofinter-connected imposition of reality that causes all but a few to submit tothis collective mind-control. When they accept this hypnotic state, and most dofrom a very early age, their brains and minds are programmed to ‘see’ thereality it has been programmed to believe in. It ‘sees’ what it is indoctrinatedto see, and edits away anything that doesn’t fit. This confirms to people mostpowerfully of all that what they believe is true! What a web. This mindmanipulation is well summed up by this observation:> “If a baby from birth is told by loving parents that 2 + 2 = 3; and later at> Sunday school, kindergarten, preparatory school, public school, and university> this young mind is again told by apparently clever and often highly respected> teachers that 2 + 2 = 3; and if this same teaching comes through the mass> media, backed by the weight of law, is it any wonder that many people, often> in very responsible positions, seriously believe that 2 + 2 = 3?” 15 The bigger the lie and the more it is repeated, the more will believe it. Thisprocess of indoctrinated reality has convinced six billion people that ‘seeingis believing’ and that the ‘world’ around them is ‘real’. It must be, they cansee, hear, touch, smell and taste it. That means it has to be real. Oh yeah? Whosays?Consensus realityThe vibrational fields we ‘decode’ into ‘physical’ holographic reality are notonly our own. They also include the thought projections of the Matrix, includingits Illuminati ‘agents’ and ‘Reptilians’, and the thoughts of those whoinfluence our beliefs. The voice in the Amazon told me that the basic landscapeof our five-sense universe like the planets and star systems, are the creationsof the Matrix entity. These are thought fields – vibrational fields – that ourminds decode into holographic ‘3-D’ illusions of physicality. There are manyplanets and stars ‘out there’ that we do not currently see because we are nottuned into their frequency range and as our ‘radio dials’ becomes more open andsensitive we will ‘see’ more of them. “We have discovered a new planet”, theheadlines will say, but we have tuned into a new planet would be more accurate.Within this basic Matrix landscape is the collective human mind, what I callconsensus reality. This adds its reality to the Matrix landscape and so life onthis planet will be different to life on another, although both will existwithin the rules of the Matrix. The holographic ‘human’ body adds itsprogramming to this mix and our ‘individual’ subconscious and conscious mindsalso tinker with the collective song. We might be singing from the same basicsong sheet manifested through the collective mind, but we can change the lyricsaround and interpret them differently. Put another way, we may agree on thebackground to the painting, but we differ on the detail we wish to include. Thisis where the ‘individual’ mind can put its own spin on consensus reality. We mayboth agree we are looking at a movie or a car, but we will interpret what we seedifferently – “nice car”, “awful movie”. In this and more profound ways we arechanging the detail of the collective reality to reflect our uniqueness of view.The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung called the collective mind the CollectiveUnconscious, the ‘species mind’ if you like. I will call this ‘consensusreality’ (what we are all agreed exists). You might symbolise the ‘individual’mind as a personal computer and the collective mind as the Internet orWorld-Wide-Web through which all computers can connect and communicate. Theso-called ‘hundredth monkey syndrome’ is an expression of the collectiveunconscious, or the consensus reality, at work. This is the discovery that whena few members of a species are taught something new suddenly all or many of thespecies begin to do the same instinctively without being shown. It is supposedto be a mystery, but it isn’t. The monkeys or whatever species implant the newknowledge in the collective mind by the very act of learning and realisation. Itis like finding new information and posting it on the Web. It becomes availableto anyone connected to the Web. When enough monkeys have added the new knowledgeto the collective mind (and it doesn’t take many) it is powerful enough to beaccessed by the other ‘computers’ and they can suddenly do instinctively whatthe pioneers had to learn. Unlike humans, animals don’t undergo a lifetime ofconditioning. This makes them more sensitive to their multi-levels of being andthey can access the collective mind with greater clarity. But humans do it, too.Every time you think, you are putting that thought, belief, knowledge oropinion, into the collective mind. If the Illuminati can programme a sense ofreality into billions of people they know that this will also consequentlydominate the reality of the collective mind. It becomes a cycle of ‘individual’minds placing their beliefs into the collective mind and, in turn, beinginfluenced or confirmed in their beliefs by the reality of the collective mind.Once again we need to break the circle. The collective mind manifests thecollective or consensus reality, the dominant belief in what is ‘real’. Thecollective mind is dominated by the belief that the walls around you are ‘solid’because that is what it has been programmed to believe. Even though you may beaware that it’s not possible for the walls to be solid, as explained earlier,the collective reality to which you are connected will go on manifesting theillusion that it is. “I know this wall can’t be solid, but I still hurt my handwhen I smack it.” When mystics meditate before performing a ‘miracle’ they aredisconnecting themselves from consensus reality, the collective mind, which saysthe ‘miracle’ is impossible.The basic landscape of the five-sense world, and all that we agree is ‘real’, isgenerated by the Matrix entity and the thought fields of the collective humanmind that our conscious minds decodes into a holographic ‘world’. To be trulyfree to create our own reality and end our belief in limitation, we need todisconnect our sense of reality from the Matrix and the collective consensus or,at least, give ourselves the option of when, and when not, to tap in. It suitsme at this moment to accept the illusion that I am sitting on a solid chair, butthere are endless other collective realities I do not wish to accept and I wantto access the power to make that choice. It is within the collective unconsciousthat much of the Matrix control will be removed and that is now happening, as Iwill come to later.I have been writing and talking for years about the way we create our ownreality and live in our own personal ‘universe’ and this is how it is done. Weare what we think we are, and what we allow others to tell us what to think weare. The two are in fact the same. Physicist David Bohm is one of those who isconvinced that reality only exists because of our thoughts, and look at theimplications of this in the ability of the Illuminati/Matrix to feed us falserealities that suit the agenda. We are also unknowingly observing thought fieldscreated to mislead us and we are turning them into holographic images we believeto be ‘physically’ real. “It must be true, mate, I saw it with my own eyes.” Thehigher levels of the hierarchy understand this process and use it mercilessly tomaintain, through hypnotising human minds, the reality that suits them.The Matrix = consensus realityThe Illuminati/Matrix seek to construct a ‘consensus reality’ in which thecollective human mind, Jung’s collective unconscious, accepts the prevailing‘truth’ it is programmed to believe. The more this happens, the more powerfulare the thought patterns holding the manipulated reality together and the denserthe holograms will appear. This is the ‘freeze vibration’ the psychiccommunications talked about in the early 1990s. It is a form of collectivehypnosis, a ‘solidified’ dream (or nightmare). Remember how the graduatestudents, Bill and Anne, shared precisely the same hypnotic reality because theyhypnotised each other? Their consciousness connected to the point where theymanifested the same illusion. This is what the consensus reality is. We aremutually hypnotising each other through the acceptance and imposition of ‘norms’to share the same basic illusion. Look around the world and observe howdiversity is being stamped out by the day and how we concede our uniqueness tothe global consensus reality we call materialism. You find the same fast foodchains, banks, architecture, economic and political systems, and lifestyleswherever you look. The assault on diversity is designed to crystallize andsolidify still further the consensus reality and make it even more difficult forpeople to see beyond it or to recognise that it’s only a manipulated illusiondesigned to imprison them. The agenda is to ‘solidify’ the consensus illusionstill further by removing all challenges and alternatives to it.The Matrix reality is constructed from largely imbalanced, deluded thought(fear) that produce low vibrational frequency patterns. Those caught in theMatrix illusion resonate to these patterns and the more caught you are, theslower your vibration, as the work of Valerie Hunt with the human energy fieldhas shown. People are both caught in the vibrational web projected by consensusreality and add to the ‘stickiness’ of the web by contributing theirlike-vibration to this construct of fear and disharmony. It is the ultimatevicious circle with prison and prisoners both contributing to the survival ofthe Matrix. Until these frequency patterns are challenged by those of Onenessand harmony, the Matrix will prevail because fear and disharmony are the Matrix.That transformation is now underway. Itzhak Bentov discusses the background tosuch phenomena in Stalking the Wild Pendulum. He points out that when you puttwo violins together and pluck a string on one of them, the same string on theother violin begins to vibrate in what is called sympathetic resonance. Bentovalso presents this example:> “Suppose we get several old-fashioned pendulum-type grandfather clocks. Let us> hang them on a wall and arrange the pendulums so that they will start beating> each other at a different angle, that is out of phase with each other. If we> disturb one of the clocks it will get locked [back] into rhythm quite fast.> The larger the number of oscillators within such a system, the more stable the> system, and the more difficult to disturb. It will force a wayward oscillator> back into line very quickly.” 16 See what is happening in the Matrix and how it remains so stable? As the mysticSri Aurobindo Ghose said, physical reality is just a mass of stable light. Themore stable it is, the denser it appears as its vibrational state slows. Thisworld, it seems, is in a state of extremely stable instability! Humans andeverything else within the Matrix are oscillators, symbolic tuning forks orviolin strings beating out a frequency that represents their state of being,their reality. When we accept the Matrix/Time Loop version of reality weresonate to its frequency and become one of its vibrational representatives likeone of those grandfather clock pendulums in Bentov’s example. As he said, themore pendulums or whatever which vibrate – oscillate – to the same pattern themore stable and difficult to change that pattern becomes. That is why the Matrixis a stable vibrational construct held together by the minds that resonate withit by believing its illusions to be real.When we have a thought we are sending out waves of sound at frequencies thefive-senses cannot hear (infrasound it is called) and this sound resonates afrequency pattern. In my video The Freedom Road (Bridge of Love), I show howparticles of sand and other material on metal plates react to sound frequencies.As the note is played, the particles immediately arrange themselves intodistinct patterns as they vibrate to the sound and make a visual image of it.They will stay there in this ‘standing wave’, as it is called, for as long asthe sound continues. When the sound changes – i.e. the frequency pattern – theparticles rearrange themselves in an instant into a new pattern that reflectsthe new frequency. The entire five-sense world is, like the body hologram, amass of vibrating reality fields held together by sound. Change the sound – thethought, the reality – and the world must change. It would appear that thesethought fields take the form of a vortex, a spiral of energy like a whirlpool ina river. As I’ve said, vortices can be incredibly stable and they can continueindefinitely until the circumstances change sufficiently to stop or redirect theflow through the spiral. The Matrix is a vortex spinning round and round,getting slower and slower, and causing the energy to become denser and denser asthe illusion of physicality has taken an ever more powerful grip on humanreality.Vibrated into lineThis is a view supported by the American psychiatrist David Shainberg of theWilliam Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry in New York. He believes thatthoughts are vortices that can become fixed and rigid. He suggests that theseexpress themselves as fixed opinions, unchanging views and a rigid sense ofreality that is resistant to change.17 I am sure he is right. The Matrix itselfis a vortex and the Time Loop is the densest level of its spiral. The Time Loopis like an anchor pulling the rest of the Matrix into greater density anddisconnection. On this planet alone the best part of six billion people resonateto the illusions of the Matrix and that is why the Matrix can continue. Now,what happens when anyone challenges the system and offers another reality? Theyare ridiculed, condemned, fired, marginalised, attacked financially, jailed oreven killed. We can observe the ‘physical’ level of this, the holographicprojection of it, as we see the consequences that such people face. But what isreally happening on a vibrational level? It is the five-sense expression of theMatrix energy pattern “forcing a wayward oscillator back into line”. We may seethe consequences in such rebels being attacked in various ways, but to theMatrix they represent a different frequency beat that needs to be kicked backinto vibrational line by the prevailing – Matrix – frequency pattern. We alsosee politicians who start out challenging the system and later become advocatesof it. Blair cabinet ministers like David Blunkett and Peter Hain, and formerLabour Party leader, Neil Kinnock, come immediately to mind. They were ‘systembusters’ who joined the system. We cannot bring the Matrix prison to aconclusion by reacting ‘out there’ with guns, bombs, anger and hatred becausethat will make the Matrix frequency even stronger by adding to its patterns ofdisharmony. The answer lies ‘in here’ as we change our own frequency patternsand connect with Oneness, harmony and love. If we change ourselves, we changeour ‘world’, our reality. Only then will the Matrix pattern be overwhelmed by amass vibrational change that will undermine the stability of the frequencyfields that hold its imprisoned minds in such servitude to the ‘material’illusion. The Matrix is a vibrational construct and that’s why it can be brokendown into mathematics, numerology and other frequency measurement. To remove thecontrol of the Matrix reality we have to break the vibrational power it has overus. In fact, most of that ‘power’ is simply our ignorance that such controlexists.Underpinning the belief in materialist ‘solid’ reality has been the pre-eminenceof official (Illuminati) science and its demand that everything be ‘proved’through experiments that can be repeated. Scientists who suggest conflictingexplanations are ostracised or undermined to defend the prevailing(Illuminati-imposed) ‘wisdom’. Fundamental to losing sight of our infinite unityis the official policy of mainstream science to depict the world as unconnectedparts and this is reflected in the very structure of science with itscompartmentalised ‘specialities’ that rarely, if ever, talk to each other. Butwhen the beliefs of scientists are affecting the outcome of their experiments,as quantum physics have shown, what the hell use is such dogma? A subatomicparticle called an anomalon has been revealed to have different properties indifferent laboratories, which, as author Michael Talbot points out, is likehaving a car that changes its colour and features depending on who is driving.The ‘laws’ of ‘science’ only apply because the scientists believe they do and,thanks to the god-like status of ‘science’, what it decides is ‘real’ becomesthe consensus reality. But it’s all illusion. Take a basic ‘law’ of scienceknown as cause and effect, the foundation of the so-called Law of Karma. Forevery action there has to be a re-action. That’s true – but only if you believeit is. If you believe it’s not true then it isn’t! People have ‘karma’ onlybecause they believe they do at the level of their ‘individual’ and collectivemind. The Danish physicist Niels Bohr, one of the great pioneers of quantumphysics, made the point that if subatomic particles only exist when they areobserved how was it possible to say what their characteristics are before theyare observed? But that is what mainstream ‘science’ continues to do –investigate and label an illusion. If everything we ‘see’ is a hologrammanifested by our conscious minds from a thought field, how can ‘science’ be anymore ‘real’ than anything else? William Tiller, a physicist at StanfordUniversity said: “… When we get to the frontiers of our understanding, we can infact shift the laws so that we’re creating the physics as we go along.” 18 Iwould say that is how it has always been. As the voice told me in Brazil, thereare no ‘laws’, only infinite possibility. What is reality? What do you think itis? Then that is what it is. These areas of knowledge are far more ‘subversive’to the system than simply exposing the secret society network or the globalagenda because they offer the means through which we can think the agenda andits fascist values out of our existence and think a new reality into being. Thisis the transition from the prison to the paradise I have long articulated. Likeall reality, the transition has to happen first in the mind – or more accuratelythe heart – and only then can we experience it in the ‘physical’ world asmanifested holograms. Rejecting the consensus reality and creating our own isthe transformation. It’s like the story of the emperor’s new clothes. Theconsensus reality was that he was wearing lovely new clothes because the crowddid not want to admit that he was naked. It took a small child to break thespell and say the obvious: “He’s got no clothes on.”‘Miracles’ are a different sense of realityThe ‘laws’ of the five-sense world may only be what we think they are, but whilewe accept them as real we are subject to their limitations. In the same way, ifwe can free our minds of these realities, we are no longer subject to their‘laws’ and limitations. This is what we call ‘miracles’. Almost everyone willhave read of ‘unexplainable’ feats like walking through fire without gettingburned, having swords pushed through the body without injury or scar, levitationand all the rest. None of these phenomena are possible to conventionalmaterialist science, but that is simply because conventional science is theknowledge equivalent of a Mickey Mouse movie. A woman I knew allowed a room inher house to be used by serious meditators, those who wanted to meditate for along time undisturbed. One guy went in and did not appear for many days and shebecame concerned that he was OK. She took him a cup of tea and slowly opened thedoor. The next moment the cup had crashed on the ground because when she lookedat him the bottom half of his body was ‘invisible’. Not possible? Oh yes it isand perfectly explainable, too, as we’ll come to shortly. In 1905, the psychic,Indridi Indridason, was part of a project by leading scientists in Iceland intothe ‘paranormal’. When he went into deep trance the scientists saw differentparts of his body disappear and reappear.19 Anything is possible, literallyanything, because we are infinite possibility. A woman I met in Texas told mehow she woke up next to her husband one morning to find him floating six feetabove the bed still asleep. Apparently, he was a bit of a fly-by-night.Dr William Tufts Brigham, the curator of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, was akeen investigator of the ‘paranormal’ and his studies included the ‘miracles’performed by the Hawaiian shamans, or kahuna. He witnessed one of them heal aman who had broken his leg so badly that pieces of bone were protruding throughthe skin. The female kahuna ‘prayed’ (concentrated thought) and meditated besidethe man and straightened his leg, pushing on the broken bones. After a fewminutes she said the healing was complete and the man stood up and walked aroundwith no sign of the severe injuries of only minutes earlier.20 This is possiblebecause as we have seen, there is no ‘bone’ – it’s an illusion. Brigham alsowatched a group of kahuna walk barefoot across volcanic rock so hot it hadhardly cooled enough to take their weight. They went through a ritual of‘prayers’ and walked across the rocks with no discomfort, let alone severeburns. Brigham was taken through the process and tried himself, although herefused to remove his boots! When he reached the other side, his boots and sockswere on fire, but his feet were fine. “I had a sensation of intense heat on myface and body, but almost no sensation in my feet”, he said.21 Some ‘miraclemen’ have allowed themselves to be studied by sceptic scientists and one was theDutch author, Jack Schwarz, in the 1970s. Watched by doctors and researchersfrom the University of California’s Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Instituteand other institutions, he would push six-inch needles into his body with nopain or bleeding; hold hot coals; and press lighted cigarettes against his skinwith no ill effects. In the 1940s, another Dutchman, Mirin Dajo, performed astage show in which he pushed a fencing foil into his body and out the otherside. Again, there was no bleeding, no pain, and only a faint red line where thesword entered and exited. He agreed to do this before a host of doctors andjournalists at a Zurich hospital and was X-rayed with the sword inside to provethat it was no trick. Later he allowed scientists and doctors in Basel to impalehim. The outcome was the same.22 When King Louis XIV of France sought to purgethe Huguenots in the 1600s, his death squads found a group known as theCamisards in the Cevennes Valley who simply would not die under anycircumstances. Michael Talbot writes:> “In an official report sent to Rome, one of the persecutors, a prior named> Abbe du Chayla, complained that no matter what he did, he could not succeed in> harming the Camisards. When he ordered them shot, the musket balls would be> found flattened between their clothing and their skin. When he closed their> hands upon burning coals, they were not harmed, and when he wrapped them head> to toe in cotton soaked with oil and set them on fire, they did not burn.” 23 Illusions cannot ‘die’ unless we believe they are ‘real’What goes on here? How is all this possible as it demonstrably is? Quite simplysuch people disconnect their minds from the consensus reality and cease to besubject to the illusory ‘rules’ of that reality. They manifest a differentillusion, a different dream. How many times do we have dreams in which weexperience events that should kill us or harm us, but don’t? It is the sameprinciple. If it is your reality that fire cannot burn your feet then it cannot.Why? Because your feet don’t exist any more than the fire does!! How can anillusion burn an illusion unless we believe it can and manifest that reality –the illusion of burning and pain? When we feel pain it is in the brain and notin the big toe we have just bashed on the table. The brain manifests the painfrom messages it receives and the conditioned brain feels pain only because itthinks it should. That is what its computer programme says and that is what itdelivers. When you change the program you get a different reality – no burningand no pain. ‘Miracles’ are only the withdrawing from consensus reality to whereits illusory ‘rules’ no longer apply. How can your body burn when you know it isonly a holographic illusion of your mind? How can a holographic illusion beharmed by a sword that is also a holographic illusion? Answer: only when youbelieve it can! The guy who ‘lost’ half his body meditating in the room wentinto such another state of consciousness – reality – that his holographic bodybegan to follow. In doing so, it began to disappear, or withdraw, from this one.As for levitation and other such ‘paranormal’ phenomena (paranormal to theconsensus reality), the principle is the same. The voice in Brazil told me:“When you levitate, it is not ‘you’ that goes ‘up’, it is your ‘world’ that goes‘down’.” Put another way, our minds don’t lift us off the ‘ground’ theyrearrange our reality by changing the ‘world’ we believe is around us. There isno bed, as there is no spoon, so how can you levitate above a bed that is notreally there with a body that is not really there? “It is not the spoon thatbends, it is only yourself.” But an observer can lock into the rearrangedreality – the thought pattern – of the ‘levitator’ and share the same illusionthat he is six feet above the bed. Oh, I hear, but isn’t levitation the art ofovercoming gravity? Only if you think it is because gravity is another illusion.If we did not believe in it we would not be subject to its rules. There are norules unless we believe there are. Infinite love is the only truth, everythingelse is illusion. Most of us will have heard accounts of people who produce‘super-human’ feats at moments of great challenge and emotional stress. Somehave lifted cars to free their child. Their mind in that concentrated, highlyemotional state, switches realities and they are no longer subject to the‘rules’ of this one. A lady told me how she spent a long time in a room fightinga fire amid smoke so dense and toxic that no one else could stay there for morethan a few seconds. Even then they were treated for the effects of smoke ontheir lungs, but my friend was found to be perfectly OK. She didn’t evenremember any smoke in the room. Once again she had changed realities in herstress and focus of mind and could not be effected by the laws of the realitythat was effecting everyone else. How many times do we hear it said that someonesurviving an ordeal that should have killed them has had a ‘miraculous escape’?They changed realities at the crucial moment, that’s all, no miracles necessary.There is a point I’d like to stress here that I feel people get confused about.They equate performing these apparent ‘miracles’ with spiritual enlightenmentand advancement and this can be a real trap. You are not some ‘living god onEarth’ because you can do the party tricks that come from knowing how we createreality. You can be a con man, quite easily, and the Illuminati are using thesetechniques all the while. These abilities can, and are, used by those who wishto expose the illusion and help people to awaken from it. But they don’t have tobe. It’s only knowledge and you can use it any way you want.Image [../Images/00057.jpg]Figure 51: Fine figure of a hologram. Every part of a hologram contains apicture of the whole and this is why every cell in the body contains theinformation to grow another whole. The body is a holographic illusion Here, there and everywhereMy wife, Pam, pointed out that within the word everywhere is also the word here,as in everywhere. How appropriate because everything is here and everywhere. Inthe same way, nowhere is also nowhere. As that old Jeff Beck song goes: “You’reeverywhere and nowhere, baby, that’s where you’re at.” 24 A wave pattern thatcan be in many places at once suddenly manifests in a single location when it isobserved. This is known as the wave collapse. The waves and the particles arethe same and they are both here and everywhere. Subatomic particles can talk toeach other over any distance without any communication being measured. Whatmakes this possible is that the particles are both each other and all the‘space’ in between. They actually don’t have to communicate because they are thesame. Is there any need for the following conversation between two ‘particles’that are both the same David Icke?“Hello, David Icke here, is that David Icke?”“Yeah, this is David Icke, nice to talk to you, David Icke.”“I have a message for you, David, can we manifest as a tea cup, please, someonejust looked at me?”“I’m already on it David, bone china, right?”“Thanks David.”“That’s OK, David.”Such a conversation is unnecessary and so is communication between subatomicparticles. The hologram is a perfect example of this theme. One of the amazingtraits of the hologram is that every part contains the whole (see Figure 51,look good, don’t I?). If you cut a holographic film into four pieces and shinethe laser on to each of them, they will not reveal four parts of the picture.Each will show a smaller version of the whole picture. Cut the print into asmany pieces as you want and they will always project the same whole image whenthe laser is shone on them. It is because the human body is a hologram thatevery cell contains all the information necessary to ‘grow’ a whole body; hencethey can clone people and animals from a single cell. Conventional ‘medicine’sitting in its establishment bunker dismisses alternatives like reflexology andcranial therapy as ridiculous quackery with no basis in ‘science’. If they werenot so mesmerised by their Mickey Mouse medicine that serves the Illuminatipharmaceutical cartel so wonderfully well, they would realise that the body is ahologram and the basis of such alternatives could not be simpler. Reflexology isan ancient form of healing that is based on the understanding that differentparts of the body, like the feet, hands and ears are mirrors of the whole body(see the foot and ear charts in Figures 52 and 53). The art goes back at leastto the ancient Indian, Egyptian and Chinese people, but yet again our belovedmedical establishment decide they know best when they actually know next tonothing. Reflexology identifies points on the feet, hands, ear, etc., thatrelate to organs of the body and through these points any imbalances in theorgans can be treated. This is not only perfectly logical when you realise thatthe body is a hologram, it is how it must be because every part of a hologramcontains the image of the whole. Every cell contains the whole, for goodnesssake, as even the medical establishment has had to recognise. The ancient art ofacupuncture is based on the holographic sub-systems of the body, as is palmreading because the hand contains the whole body. More than that, every part ofevery hand, foot and ear also contains the whole and so does every part of everyfinger and every part of every part of the finger. The body hologram is anexpression of the hologram that is the universe and the cosmos, and so is everypart of the body down to every cell, atom and electron.Image [../Images/00058.jpg]Image [../Images/00059.jpg]Figures 52 and 53: Reflexology and acupuncture can find a representation of thewhole body in the foot, the ear and elsewhere because the body is a hologram andevery part contains a smaller version of the whole body Holographic memorySo to the brain, the computer-like interface between the mind and theholographic ‘body’ of the five-senses. The brain is not the mind, it is acomputer used by the mind and thus scientists have never located where in thebrain lies the mind. They never will because it’s not there. We don’t think fromthe brain, but through the brain at the five-sense level of reality. Mainstreamscience has also been unable to locate the area of the brain that contains thememory because the memory (the computer hard drive) exists throughout the brain.Of course it does, the brain is a hologram and every part contains the whole.Horrible experiments on animals have removed massive parts of their brains andstill found they could remember the tasks they were set when the whole brain wasintact. People who have large parts of their brains removed because of tumoursdo not lose specific memories. They might not remember in general quite as wellbecause they have moved to a smaller level of the holographic memory where thereis less clarity than in the whole. But they don’t lose one memory completely andretain another in crystal clarity as they would if memory was located in onearea.The hologram has a staggering capacity to store information. You can store manypictures on the same piece of holographic film, for instance, and by changingthe angle at which you direct the laser you can choose which one you want tosee. Accessing our memory works in basically the same way. We move our ‘laser’to find the information we are looking for in the hologram and those who can dothis highly efficiently are said to have a ‘photographic memory’. Yes, aholographic photographic memory. People can ‘read’ objects like watches orjewellery and glean from them detailed information about their history andowners because the objects are holograms and they have recorded thatinformation. Our body holograms store memory from all of the senses. When, forinstance, we smell something it can trigger a memory just as powerfully as whenwe see or hear something that recalls an experience. Our memory extends beyondeven the brain hologram and is located throughout the body hologram, too. Inturn, the body hologram contains the memory of the cosmic hologram and so on.Everything is connected to everything else. Everything is everything else. TheMatrix cannot literally divide the whole into parts because Oneness is alwaysOneness, but it can give the illusion of division and polarity, and this is whatit does by manipulating our sense of reality. Division and polarity areillusions because all is One.Holographic sensesAll our five-senses are holographic and are located throughout thehologram-body. Yes, even our sight. It is clear that we don’t need eyes to seewhen you sift through the endless accounts of those who have experienced theout-of-body or near-death phenomena. They leave their bodies and their ‘eyes’,but they can still see. This is possible because the mind does not ‘see’, itdecodes frequency patterns into holographic illusions it thinks it sees. It is avirtual reality and you don’t need eyes to see what your mind is thinkingbecause it is all happening ‘in here’, not ‘out there’. If something can decodefrequencies into holograms it can ‘see’. As all consciousness can do this,everything can ‘see’ and every part of the body hologram has ‘eyes’. Excuse mewhile I look through my big toe at the inside of my sock. Anyone got a needle?No really, we can see throughout the body and that must be the case if the bodyis a hologram. More horrible experiments (I don’t want to know that badly,thanks) have shown that rats can continue to see perfectly well with 90 per centof their visual cortex in the brain removed, while cats continue to see after 98per cent of their optic nerves have ceased to function. There have been manyexperiments to show how some people can see and read through their hands whiletheir eyes were covered with a blindfold. The hands and all other parts of thebody can send visual messages to the visual cortex in the brain from where we‘see’. But in fact, we don’t even need the brain to ‘see’ – that’s just anotherlevel of the multi-levelled illusion. Does the Infinite need eyes or a brain tosee??Paul Bach-y-Rita, a neuroscientist and physician at Wisconsin-MadisonUniversity, says: “You don’t see with the eyes. You see with the brain.” (Beyondthat we see with the mind). When an image reaches the eye’s retina, he says, it“becomes nerve pulses no different from those from the big toe”. Informationenters the eyes as a frequency pattern and the brain turns it into a 3-D image.Now, because every part of a hologram contains the whole, every part of the body– the hand, toe, knee – has the ability to pass frequency patterns to the brain,which it transforms into holograms that we can ‘see’. This means that peoplereally do have eyes in their backsides. I have heard some people speak of beingable to see 360 degrees when they have entered altered states of consciousnessthat make them more attuned to these senses by withdrawing their focus from thefive-sense consensus reality. All this is perfectly explainable from theholographic perspective. Life magazine featured a Russian woman called RosaKuleshova who could read with her fingertips and others have been able to do thesame with other parts of their bodies like the nose and ear.25 David EisenbergMD, a clinical research fellow at the Harvard Medical School, highlighted twoyoung Chinese sisters who could read with their armpits! 26 There was also the‘miraculous’ discovery by Paul Bach-y-Rita and other researchers at theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison that we can see through our tongues. They havedeveloped a device to stimulate the tongue’s ability to ‘see’ and this hasallowed blind people to regain vision. One report said:> “The tongue, an organ of taste and touch, may seem like an unlikely substitute> for the eyes. After all, it’s usually hidden inside the mouth, insensitive to> light, and not connected to optic nerves. However, a growing body of research> indicates that the tongue may in fact be the second-best place on the body for> receiving visual information from the world and transmitting it to the brain. > “Earlier research had used the skin as a route for images to reach the nervous> system. That people can decode nerve pulses as visual information when they> come from sources other than the eyes shows how adaptable, or plastic, the> brain is, says one of the device’s inventors.” 27 Research is underway to see if other lost senses can be restored by routing themthrough other parts of the body. They will find that they can for the reasons Ihave described. Most people cannot access these inherent abilities because theydon’t know they have them and they don’t believe they have them. Until they do,they won’t. We are what we think we are and we can do what we believe we can do.Every part of the hologram has the senses of the whole and is conscious. MichaelTalbot tells a story in The Holographic Universe that gave him an insight intothis. He had been having trouble with his spleen and had been usingvisualisation to treat the problem, using his mind to rebalance the hologramthat is the spleen. One night he became frustrated with the process and, in theprivacy of his own thoughts, gave his spleen a right rollicking for notresponding quickly enough. A few days later he went to see a psychic about hishealth. She identified the spleen problem and then paused, looking confused,before saying: “Your spleen’s very upset about something … have you been yellingat your spleen?” She said the spleen became ill because it thought that is whatTalbot wanted. He had been giving the wrong messages, she said, and now thespleen was confused at being scalded. “Never, never get angry with your body oryour internal organs”, she said, “Only send them positive messages.” 28Big bang baloneyA little observation in the light of all this. Science says that the universewas created by the ‘Big Bang’. It says that matter was concentrated in afireball of enormous density and this was all that existed. Then the fireball,or cosmic egg, exploded and the matter and space it contained expanded out fromthe centre and is still expanding. The official theory says this is why thegalaxies etc. are still moving away from each other. Out of this coolingexplosion of matter came the universe as we see it, we are told. But hold on. Ifthere is no matter because matter is an illusion of the mind, how could there bea “Big Bang” of original matter, except as an illusion? The universe, likeeverything in the Matrix, is a mass of vibrational thought fields that our mindsdecode into a 3-D holographic illusion. As a result of this big bang explosionand the process that followed, the official story goes, subatomic particlesemerged. But if waveforms only become particles when they are observed, howcould they be created by a process of ‘matter’ that followed the explosion? Theycould only be ‘formed’ out of thought fields by being observed into holograms.Maybe someone was looking, eh? The universe is the thought equivalent of acomputer program and just as a software program does not need to explode to beseen in Windows 2000, neither does the universe need to explode to be formed asthought fields observed into holographic illusion. Imagine if there was anexplosion of ‘matter’ every time a thought field was created. It would be bloodynoisy, wouldn’t it? BOOM! “Hey Ethel, stop thinking will you, I can’t hear thetelly.” “Sorry dear, I was just thinking we need some more cheese.” BOOM! “Andsome tomatoes.” BOOM! “Etheeeeel!” There was no need for an explosion to createthe universe. Once the thought fields are projected it’s a done deal. If thegalaxies are still moving away from each other, that is because the ‘program’was written that way, not because something had to go ‘bang’.The infinite ‘One’In my altered states in Brazil I entered a ‘place’ in which I was consciously‘me’, but also everything else. This is a state of being that has been describedthroughout known ‘history’ by mystics, meditators, people under the influence ofpsychoactive drugs, and those who have had ‘near death’ and ‘out-of-body’experiences – those who have expanded their conscious awareness to beyond theTime Loop’s five-sense-reality where all appears to be divided into independentparts. David Bohm and Karl Pribram, two of the world’s leading researchers intoholographic reality, agree these out-of-body experiences sound like what theycall the ‘implicate order’ – the world the five-senses cannot perceive.29Mainstream science, the science of the Illuminati agenda, rejects Oneness andpromotes a belief in unconnected parts. This serves the Matrix magnificently. Itconditions this belief in the human mind and we then see what we have beenprogrammed to see – a world of parts and not the seamless ‘One’. Such a sense ofisolation and disconnection brings a perception of being small, powerless andinsignificant. This is what the Matrix needs to hold us in its spell. It alsomeans that we seek ‘individual’ solutions to problems when you can never find a‘solution’ without realising that everything is connected. A simple example isthe way ‘Western’ governments give ‘aid’ to poor countries while thetransnational corporations from the ‘West’ exploit those countries and bleedthem dry of far more wealth than they ever receive in aid. If you don’t view theworld economy as a whole and change the way it functions as a whole, you willnever solve the ‘individual’ problems and injustices that such an imbalancedwhole is bound to cause. Viewing everything as unconnected parts and not as aseamless Oneness is vital to the Matrix/Illuminati agenda. It is no accident,therefore, that, as I have detailed in other books, the Royal Society in London,the home of establishment science, was created by high degree Freemasons onbehalf of the Illuminati. The so-called ‘classic physics’ of the materialistsbecame the official line from the 17th century with Isaac Newton and the Frenchmathematician, Rene Descartes, who viewed the world as a machine. This dogmadenied the existence of the spirit because they believed they could explain lifewithout a need for one. But like most of the ‘facts’ pedalled by mainstreamscience these were not proofs, but mere assumptions. According to the book, HolyBlood, Holy Grail,30 Isaac Newton is reported to have been a grand master of anelite secret society in the Illuminati web called the Priory of Sion (see myother books). It claims to go back at least to the 12th century and to have beenoriginally closely connected to the Illuminati Knights Templar. Others disputethis, however. The Priory of Sion says it seeks to advance the goals andinfluence of the Merovingian bloodline that today manifests as the royalfamilies of Europe, a long list of US presidents and others in positions ofglobal banking, business and media power. With the advanced esoteric knowledgeavailable in the upper levels of secret societies, there is no chance that IsaacNewton was not aware that his version of materialism, a world only of matter,was a nonsense. But how this has served the Illuminati agenda as it denied theexistence of the spirit (when you’re dead, your dead) and viewed the world as aseries of parts and not as one unified, infinite whole. The basis of mainstreamscience is baloney and those in control know it. Stanislav Grof, writing in TheHolotropic Mind, says:> “A true scientist does not confuse theory with reality and does not try to> dictate what nature should be like. It is not up to us to decide what the> human psyche can do and what it cannot do to fit our neatly organized> preconceived ideas. If we are ever to discover how we can best cooperate with> the psyche, we have to allow it to reveal its true nature to us.” 31 The Illuminati are desperate to prevent this, of course. Others are nowchallenging this deception, however, and people like the Danish physicist NielsBohr and London University physicist David Bohm say that every ‘part’ is anexpression of one indivisible whole. A gathering army of real scientists aresaying the same. They are accepting what mystics and their like have been sayingall along. Those with open hearts and minds are beginning to speak the samelanguage of Oneness even though they come to this conclusion from differentdirections. There is no ‘empty space’ and there are no ‘vacuums’. Everywhere isconsciousness that connects everything to everything else. David Bohm and othershave established that not only do two particles act as if they know what theother is doing, trillions of them do. In fact, all of them do because all isall. Everything is everything. Behind the apparent diversity is oneconsciousness. I have heard this explained as a vibration that is travelling sofast that it appears to be everything, in the same way that if you orbited theEarth at fantastic speed you would never know where you were at any point andyou would seem to be everywhere on the planet at the same time. I don’t buythat. The Infinite doesn’t have to travel at such speeds to be everywhere. Itdoesn’t have to travel at all. It is already everywhere. It just is. Why wouldyou have to move to appear to be everything and everywhere when you are alwayseverything and everywhere? Bohm believes that we need to look at the world as aballet dance and not as a crowd of unorganised people. The dance is the primereality, not the ‘individual’ dancers. But as the poet William Butler Yeatswrote: “You cannot tell the dancer from the dance.” Our five-senses can onlyperceive an almost immeasurable fraction of the Infinite and yet humanity hasbeen kidded into believing that what it thinks it sees is all there is. On abasic level we talk of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, but they are thesame body of water. Every subatomic particle, atom, cell, organ, limb, body andmind is a mirror of the cosmos. They are the cosmos and the cosmos is them. Itis the same with every droplet of water, every tree, every tulip and blade ofgrass. In the words of William Blake:> To see a World in a Grain of Sand> And a Heaven in a Wild Flower> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand> And Eternity in an hour. The imprisoned minds of the Matrix may have forgotten they are the Infinite, butthey are and always shall be. The only difference between the Infinite and theMatrix is that the Infinite knows it is the Infinite and the Matrix hasforgotten. You are not Joe Bloggs or Bill Smith; that is only a programmedillusion. You are all that is: everything. Yes, little old ‘insignificant’,‘powerless’, you.We don’t live life; we are life.

What mysteries? > Man is what he believes > Anton Chekhov (1860 – 1904) I was once interviewed by a Christian radio host and I made the point thatChristianity and official ‘science’ refused to investigate the mysteries of lifeunless the outcome conformed to their belief system. “Well, maybe there aremysteries that God doesn’t want us to know”, he said. This is typical of thelittle me, BIG GOD, concept of mainstream religion that maintains its followersin life-long slavery to a fairy tale. Investigating mysteries with an open mindis fatal for both religion and establishment ‘science’ because dogma can onlysurvive if it remains unchallenged. So, dear child of the Lord, have faith andshut-the-fuck-up. You too, professor.It is not ‘God’ that doesn’t want us to know; it is the Illuminati and theMatrix who invented the whole concept of ‘God’ to serve their ends. They don’tcare what your rigid belief may be, so long as you have one, and it has ensuredyou have plenty to choose from. Rigid dogma = closed mind = the Matrix has you.As we have seen, once we begin to understand reality and how it is mademanifest, the mysteries of life, unanswerable by religion and mainstream‘science’, become rather less mysterious.Different minds, different facesSince the early 1990s, I have been researching the mind-control technique knownas Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).As I outlined earlier, this is when the mind is fractured through trauma andprogramming into a series of apparent ‘personalities’ or ‘alters’, each withdifferent attitudes, beliefs and often ‘ages’. I have sat in a therapist’soffice and seen a 30-year-old woman, who had been horrendously abused sincechildhood, manifest at least seven distinct ‘personalities’ in half an hour,including one of a baby. In line with all ‘multiples’, each ‘personality’ hadits own name, background and characteristics, and each was brought forward inturn by the therapist using the correct trigger words and codes. The woman wasvery nice in ‘front alter’ mode, but one of her programmed back alters was purevenom when it was activated. What’s more, as one ‘personality’ was switched toanother the woman’s face changed. This is one of the many ‘mystery’characteristics of multiples; their facial features, including eye colour, canchange when they switch personalities and so can their brainwave patterns. One‘personality’ may be drunk or high on drugs, but when they are switched toanother alter they cease to be affected in any way by the drink or drugs. I havemet such people. Features on the skin, like moles and scars, can disappear whenone alter replaces another as the conscious mind. The same body under one‘personality’ may be allergic to something, but not when other alters areactivated; a doctor can prescribe a drug that will have an effect on the bodyunder one alter, but have no effect with another. It even extends to the factthat they can overdose if a drug is given to an adult alter and they are thenswitched into one of their child personalities. They can be ill in one mode andperfectly healthy in another and they can be spark out under anaesthesia in onepersonality, yet wake up on the operating table fully conscious if another alterkicks in. Women with MPD can have different menstrual cycles with eachpersonality. Another trait is that often multiples don’t age anything like asquickly as the rest of us and they can look older or younger, depending on thealter in the driving seat at the time. I remember Cathy O’Brien, one of thebest-known victims of US government mind-control, telling me that she was notallowed to know the ‘time’ in her mental captivity and in this period she didnot perceptibly age.Mind is body and body is mindThese apparently astonishing traits of multiple personality disorder arebaffling to mainstream science. But from the perspective outlined here it is allquite straightforward. The body is a hologram manifested by mind and the mind’ssense of reality is governed by its belief. When these various ‘personalities’take control of the body hologram it changes to match the new state of mind –belief. This can happen because the body hologram is an illusion of the mind andthe mind can change it in any way it wants. What are known as alters or‘personalities’ are simply different realities and when you change the sense ofreality you change its holographic illusion. In fact, the different ‘alters’ areprobably different holograms created by the different versions of reality. Thesedifferent ‘personalities’ are different holographic ‘brains’, you might say, andthe principle is similar to having many holographic pictures on the samephotographic film. When you shine the laser at different angles on the wavepatterns, you pick out a different picture. This is what the ‘trigger’ codes aredoing that activate the different programmed personalities of the ‘multiple’.They are accessing different programmed holograms. That is what the ‘alters’are.So let us look again at the ‘mysteries’ I outlined above. How can someone bedrunk or high on drugs in one mode, but sober when switched to another? Thereality that drinks the alcohol or takes the drugs, accepts that it will becomeintoxicated or high because that is its conditioned and, through the DNA,inherited belief. It doesn’t have to react in this way because the booze anddrugs are an illusion, as is the body, and how can the effect of an illusion onan illusion be real? Do you think the Infinite gets pissed? When an alter –holographic reality – is switched, the new alter/hologram does not have thereality of being drunk or high.How could it? It was not the reality that popped the pills or swigged theliquor. Why should it be affected by them? Skin features like moles and scarsappear and disappear depending on the reality of the mind hologram in control.Maybe an alter reality was formed before the illusion of the scar or mole wasthere. If so, it is not going to manifest something it does not believe in. Itis the same with an allergy. If the alter-reality does not believe it has anallergy, it won’t have one. Without the cooperation of the mind-brain(consciousness and computer) it can’t. The effect of a drug depends on whetherthe prevailing reality believes in it. If it does, the drug will ‘work’, if itdoesn’t, it will not. Remember, much of this is taking place on a non-conscious,as well as a conscious level. The drug given to an ‘adult’ alter that overdosesthe ‘child’ alter is, once again, an example of different realities experiencingwhat they believe on conscious and unconscious levels, and through the inheritedDNA programming. How can it be any other way? The difference is not the‘physical body’; it is the reality of the mind.Illness and disease are illusions. One reality may believe it is ill whileanother may not. When the switch happens the illness will disappear in a flashbecause it was an illusion to start with and the new alter/hologram does notbelieve in it. A multiple can feel pain in one alter and it will disappear inanother, just as some alters may need spectacles, but others will see 20/20. Ifyou give an aesthetic to one brain-hologram, and it accepts the effect, it willbe off to the land of nod. But if another one takes over, how can it be effectedby the aesthetic when it does not have the reality of having the shot? It can’t.It wakes up with no idea what is going on – “what are you doing with that bloodyknife, mate?” It’s all illusion, as are the menstrual cycles of women. Does theInfinite have a period? Oh, but the woman must menstruate to release the buildup of blood, right? Oh really? Then why could the bodies of some multiples havea continuous period if the alters were activated in the correct sequence? Wheredoes all that blood come from? Or, if you structured the sequence in anotherway, they could never have a period. Where does all that blood go? It goesnowhere and it comes from nowhere: it is ILLUSION! Why is it that multiples thatare disconnected from the five-sense version of ‘time’ don’t age, or at leastage as fast as everyone else? By now this answers itself. There is no time, sohow can time age us? When you use a laser to project a holographic picture of ahuman body it doesn’t age no matter how long you leave it there. You could leaveit for a thousand years and it would not age a second. Our bodies are hologramsand we could do the same. We only appear to age because we believe in ‘time’ andthe illusory passage from ‘past’ to ‘future’. We age because we believe we do.Does the Infinite need Botox? The facial features of multiples change as theyswitch because our illusory faces merely reflect our sense of reality. Ourbodily features are holographic illusions; change the illusion in your mind andyou change the features you appear to ‘see’. You switch holographic realities.All this is not confined to those with multiple personality disorder; it appliesto everyone. Now, what is another term for this instant transformation of facialand body features? Go on you sceptics who have laughed all these years … I knowit’s hard, but do try … shhhh … yes, almost there … shhh-ape … go on … yes, yes… shape-shifting! Exactly. When you see just how illusory our reality is,shape-shifting Reptilians are a small deal indeed.Shape-shifting? That Icke’s a nutter.Since I began writing and speaking about shape-shifting, I have, naturally, beenthe subject of still more ridicule. I understand why people have dismissed theidea because they are so caught in the illusion of the ‘physical’ and cannotperceive of anything that does not conform to its ‘laws’. But there is no‘physical’, it’s illusion; and an illusion can take any form its creator wantsand shift from one to another at will. Visualise a human being now in your mindand watch him or her shape-shift into a Reptilian entity. See, an illusion isanything you choose it to be. Accounts of shape-shifting beings, not least thosewho shift between ‘human’ and reptilian form, abound throughout the ancientworld, as we have seen. They feature in the accounts of the same people who saidthat all was One and this world was ‘maya’ – illusion; the same ‘primitivepeople’ who are now being proved right by the cutting edge of scientificresearch. Let us get down to some scientific basics here. The scientists saythis ‘physical’ world is made up of atoms and subatomic particles such aselectrons. This is how Michael Talbot describes their properties in TheHolographic Universe:> “The electron, like some shape-shifter out of folklore, can manifest as either> a particle or a wave … This chameleon-like ability is common to all subatomic> particles. It is also common to all things once thought to manifest> exclusively as waves. Light, gamma rays, radio waves, X-rays – all can change> from waves and back again. Today physicists believe that subatomic phenomena> should not be classified solely as either waves or particles, but as a single> category of somethings that are always somehow both. These somethings are> called quanta, and physicists believe they are the basic stuff from which the> entire universe is made.” 1 People dismiss the ancient and modern claims about shape-shifters when the wholecosmos down to the tiniest particle is in a constant state of shape-shifting!For goodness sake an electron can appear in one place and then another withoutpassing through the ‘space’ in between, the so-called ‘quantum jump’. Butshape-shifting is not possible? Talbot adds: “The capacity to shape-shift fromone kind of particle to another is just another of a quantum’s abilities.” Aparticle in the blood called the somatid is “an astonishing shape-shifter inculture” and “in rapid progression (less than 90 hours) it can be spore, doublespore, bacteria, microbial globular form, yeast, ascii, mycelial form, fibrousthallus, etc.”2 But how can a person shape-shift from one ‘body’ to another whenthey would have to do an instant ‘swap’ of their heart, lungs, liver and so on?Surely they would die? No, no. I realise it is a massive leap, but I repeat: thebody is an illusion, a figment of the programmed mind. It is really a frequencyfield, a thought form, and this is how people can appear and disappear just likethe guy meditating in the woman’s house. You don’t need your organs to surviveunless you believe you do and create that reality. You don’t need to eat and youdon’t need to breathe if you can override the programming that you do. A womancalled Therese Neumann did not eat or drink for 35 years. She began to drinkonly liquids in 1923 and four years later even stopped that. In one two weekperiod in July 1927, a medical doctor and four Franciscan nurses kept a watch onher 24 hours a day. They confirmed that she consumed nothing and had no illeffects, loss of weight or dehydration.3 This continued for the rest of herlife. Taking her to dinner would have been a cheap date, eh? “What would youlike to eat, darling?” “Er, nothin’.”The body is a holographic illusion and if your mind is deprogrammed enough youcan turn it into a bus if you want. “Hey, Ethel, I have decided to be the number28 to Oxford Street” – “OK dear, mind the traffic.” Michael Talbot says ofextraterrestrial entities: “… if we are being visited by beings who are asinsubstantial and plastic in form as the bodies [out-of-body experiencers] findthemselves in after they have exteriorised, it is not at all surprising thatthey might appear in a chameleon-like multitude of shapes.”4 I emphasised inChildren of the Matrix that what we call ‘extraterrestrials’ are really‘inter-dimensionals’. Our ‘bodies’ take a form that reflects our state of beingand it could well be that the manipulators (sentient programs) projected by theMatrix often take a reptilian form because their emotionless state and survivalmentality is an expression of the same basic thought field blueprint or programthat we can observe in the emotionless, survivalist, Reptilian species in theIlluminati on Earth. What people see now as extraterrestrials are the modernexpression of the ‘fairies’, ‘elves’ and ‘little people’ that the ancientsclaimed to have seen. What we can say with certainty is that extraterrestrialsand the ‘fairies’ do not exist as solid ‘real’ 3-D entities. Why so sure?Because nothing exists in that form, except as illusions.‘Extraterrestrial’ hologramsThe ETs and fairies will be, as with everything in the Matrix, frequencypatterns that can take any form they, or their creator, chooses. This is thebasis of shape-shifting once again. It is the frequency pattern that ‘shifts’and it appears to the five-sense level that the physical body has shifted. Ithas, but only because its base form, a vibrational pattern, has changed and wehave changed the way we decode the pattern into a hologram. These frequency‘entities’ can take any form they wish when they understand the process. Also,our sense of reality decodes these patterns into holographic form and it couldwell be that we ‘see’ these entities in the form that suits our prevailingreality: i.e. the ancients would ‘see’ them as fairies, elves and goblins, whilewe would decode them as high-tech ‘ETs’. Many people have reported seeing‘angels’ or had visions of Jesus or Mother Mary. Sometimes enormous shrines havebeen built as a result and the ‘visionary’ given sainthood. These are illusions,creations of belief and manipulated thought projections designed to confirm suchbelief. The visions ‘see’ the classic portrayals of ‘Jesus’ and ‘Mary’ whenthose portrayals are only the result of painters who presented their own idea ofhow they looked. One of the most famous Christian ‘visions’ was at Knock,Ireland, in 1879 when fourteen people saw the glowing figures of Jesus, Mary andSt John the Evangelist near a church. In line with what I have just said, thevision of St John looked very much like a statue of him in a local village. Thefigures were so real that the witnesses could read the letters on the book that‘John’ was holding. But when one of them, a woman, tried to touch ‘Mary’, therewas nothing to embrace but air. The woman said: “The figures appeared so fulland lifelike I could not understand why my hands could not feel what was soplain and distinct to my sight.”5 The figures were holograms and were no morereal than the 3-D image of a holographic photograph of an apple or pear. Theonly difference between ‘Mary’ and the bodies we think we have is the illusionof density. Is it now still so incredible that those in control of ourcollective reality, the Illuminati, are holographic projections or ‘sentientprograms’ and not ‘human’ or even consciousness as we perceive it? What are the‘spaceships’ that so many people ‘see’? They are frequency fields and 3-Dillusions and they can defy the ‘laws’ of this reality, just as the firewalkerdoes not burn his feet.Michael Talbot tells in The Holographic Universe how he saw a holographic imageof a werewolf form around his body when he was writing a novel about them: “…the holographic-like image that enveloped my body was real enough that when Ilifted my arm I could actually see individual hairs in the fur and the way thecanine nails protruded from the wolfish hand that encased my own hand.” 6 Apsychic, Carol Dryer, walked into the room and also saw the ‘werewolf’, but whenhe stopped thinking about the novel the image faded. Psychics often reportseeing holographic objects around people and these are thought patterns in theperson’s aura or energy field that the psychic observes into a 3-D reality.Carol Dryer apparently saw potatoes swirling around a woman’s head on oneoccasion and it turned out she worked for a potato organisation in Idaho.Living to die? Or dying to live?If our bodies don’t exist, except as thought fields and holographic illusions,how can they die? Only if we, and they, through their DNA programming, believethey can. Believe in death and you will appear to ‘die’. Don’t believe in it andyou can’t. By that I don’t mean that you will be condemned to live in the bodyfor all infinity; you can drop the illusion whenever you choose. I mean thedifference between ‘dying’ as perceived in the present sense and consciouslydeciding to leave the illusion in the full awareness that this is what you aredoing. Death has been described as walking in your mind and that is all it is, achange of perception and point of observation. Even if you believe in death youstill won’t die in the sense of ceasing to exist because you can’t. You areinfinite consciousness. You can ‘believe’ your body into the grave, yes, andbillions do. But once that has been unloaded you are still conscious in anotherreality. This is the transformation process behind the ‘mystery’ of near-death(NDE) and out-of body (OBE) experiences. They are only a mystery becauseestablishment science cannot explain them. Incalculable numbers of people haveexperienced leaving their bodies on operating tables or after heart attacks androad accidents only to learn that they had ‘died’ when it was happening (NDE).Others have experienced a spontaneous disconnection between body and mindwithout ‘physically dying’ (OBE). The NDE and OBE have also been described inaccounts throughout known ‘history’. Both groups tell basically the same story.The common theme of these experiences is floating above the body with mind andsight intact. They can give themselves new ‘bodies’ in this state simply bythinking of one and sometimes they still look like the body they have recentlyleft. This is what was called in the first Matrix movie ‘residual self-image’.This is the way your mind is used to perceiving its form and so it continues todo so. People who have returned from these disembodied states have said thatthey had no form until they ‘thought’ and then whatever they thought becametheir reality. This is what is happening in the five-sense world, if we onlyrealised, and it is this process the Illuminati work so hard to exploit. RobertMonroe, a highly experienced ‘OBEer’, who founded the Monroe Institute inAmerica, described his form in the out-of-body state as a “vibrational pattern”made up of “many interacting and resonating frequencies”.7 Yes, that is what weare in our Matrix state, but not when we are truly and consciously at One withthe Infinite because the Infinite in awareness of itself does not vibrate. Onlyillusion vibrates. Mind thinks all (vibration). Heart is all (stillness).Those who have left their bodies also speak of the feeling of Oneness, of beingeverything. But I wonder how many are actually experiencing Oneness in itsInfinite sense and how many are experiencing a state that is simply far morelike Oneness than they experience in the Time Loop, the greatest level ofillusory disconnection. Most people judge their level of happiness by theirlevel of unhappiness. They are not actually happy, but they are less unhappythan at other times and so they take this to be happiness. Another constantreport from NDEers and OBEers is that they can go anywhere in an instant. Asmany have said: “I only had to think it and I was there.” That may be theperception, but I would describe it another way: you only have to think it andyou become conscious of a ‘there’ where you already are! How? Because ‘there’ isyou. Everywhere is you. ‘You’ are everything and everything is everywhere. Whywould you have to move when you are everywhere already? Where does theholographic body exist when every part of the hologram contains the whole and isthe whole?‘Heaven’ and ‘Hell’Many of those who have had a near-death experience have described in detail theactivity and conversations in the room or operating theatre while they were‘dead’ and floating above their body. The wealth of supporting evidence is nowso enormous that even mainstream science has had to take it seriously, at leaston the surface. I read of experiments in which certain symbols were placed onthe top of light shades in operating theatres that only someone floating abovethem could see. “Hey, doc, you’ve got some funny symbols on your light shades.”Eureka!! Those who have experienced life without the body invariably tell of abeautiful world of love and bliss from which they do not want to return. Theytalk of going through a ‘tunnel’, meeting dead relatives and beings of light,who tell them it is not their ‘time’ to die and they must return. For me, thesestories mostly describe other dimensions of the Matrix. They are experiencingless dense realms of the Matrix vortex, but the Matrix still has them. These arethe realities to which most consciousness gravitates between ‘re-incarnations’back into the Time Loop illusion. Interestingly, in line with what I outlinedearlier, those with a Christian belief tend to see Christian deities and scenesin these near-death states, while a Hindu and believers in other religions tendto see their version of where they expect to go after ‘death’. They are free oftheir Earth body, but not free of the illusion. Death is no cure for ignoranceand the Matrix is full of these traps because it needs to stop its energy supplyfrom leaving the illusion, the vortex, and consciously connecting with InfiniteOneness. These Hindu, Christian, Jewish and Muslim ‘heavens’ are as much anillusion as the reality we experience. They are frequency patterns that thestill-‘disconnected’ mind observes into its holographic version of reality after‘death’.Someone who commits suicide in a dark and desolate state is likely to experiencean illusion of that – a ‘Hell’ of their own making. Those overwhelmed by guilt,who believe that their behaviour will condemn them to an eternity stoking thefires for the guy with the horns, will likely create that illusory experience.Heaven is an illusion and Hell is an illusion. They are manipulated polaritiescreated by the Matrix and in many ways the ultimate ones. The holographicillusion extends throughout the Matrix and only the vibrational density differsin these different realities. The idea of ‘old souls’ and ‘new souls’ is a myth,I would suggest. These terms only describe levels of illusory disconnection.Another illusion, I would say, is the ‘life review’, much recounted by neardeath experiencers, in which we are supposed to see all that we have experiencedin a five-sense lifetime to help us understand what we still have to ‘work on’and learn. Does the Infinite have to go to school when it knows everything? Doesthe Infinite need to have endless lives on Earth to become enlightened? Does theInfinite need a ‘life review’ to decide its future curriculum? Does the Infinitehave an ‘old soul’ or a ‘new soul’? Does the Infinite have to be turned back atthe border by ‘beings of light’ and told that it still has things to learn? Doesthe Infinite need a religion? Can the Infinite die? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.Right, agreed. Then neither do WE!! It’s all illusion. I am not saying thatthese things are not experienced by discarnate entities in other levels of theMatrix. I have no doubt that in their reality they are. I am saying that theseare illusions and not necessary.When disabled people have out-of-body experiences their disability disappearsand the ‘old’ can be ‘young’ if only they choose to think it. All the ‘rules’ oflimitation they believed to exist are seen to be illusions of the mind/brain.Does the Infinite need a wheelchair? Then neither do we – unless we and ourholograms think we do. Mental handicap is also an illusion of the body hologramwhich identifies who it is and what it can do with the ‘physical laws’ itsinherited programming believes to be real. Can the Infinite be mentallyhandicapped? No, then neither can we – unless we and our body programmingbelieve in the possibility. When someone dubbed mentally handicapped leaves thefive-sense realm they are no longer ‘handicapped’. It is a programmed illusionof mind and body. There is a New Age belief that ‘souls’ sometimes choose toexperience disabled bodies in their journey of evolutionary experience. I wouldnot dispute that this can happen, just as I do not dispute the fact thatastrology, tarot card readings, and many of the other New Age and Easterntechniques can be extremely accurate in gifted hands. I am not saying that theseare not valid in the realms of vibration, quite the opposite. I am, however,suggesting that they are phenomena of the Matrix and, as such, illusions thatcan help to trap us if we are not aware of this. I am not a friggin’ Taurus, Iam the Infinite All. But if I believe I am a Taurus, I will be, and I willidentify with being a part and not the whole. There is no David Icke – illusion– so how can he be a Taurus? The souls that re-incarnate into different ‘bodies’in the Time Loop, as I’m sure they do, are similarly caught in the Matrixillusion of learning through experience when they already know everything.Why ‘good’ and ‘evil’ need each otherHow ironic that the greatest human fear is dying (fear of the unknown) when wedon’t and cannot die. It is this fear that drives the engine of the ‘health’industry in all its forms and has turned the doctor into a demi-god. Oh, doctor,please save me, I don’t want to die!! I understand that in humanity’sconditioned state. But the very fact that you believe you can die means that youwill experience the illusion of it and if you believe that the doctor can makethings go right it also means that you accept that things can go wrong. Onepolarity creates the other. If people believe in the doctor when he says he will‘cure’ them, they will also believe in the doctor when he tells them he can’t.They ‘die’ because they believe that is what must happen. They think themselvesto death. After all, the doctor I believe has cured me in the ‘past’ now saysnothing can be done. See the polarity? The belief in the doctor’s ability toheal creates a belief in the doctor when he says he cannot heal. For thisreason, as endless research has shown, when a doctor tells someone they have sixmonths to live that is pretty much how long most of them last. They thinkthemselves to death because of their belief in the doctor. I would suggest thatthe key realisation here is not that the doctor can cure or not cure, but thatthere is nothing to cure and there is no doctor! It is manipulated illusion.A belief in ‘good’ must, by definition, create the illusion of ‘evil’. How canthere be a belief in good if there is not also a belief in evil? Left needsRight in politics for the same reason and the ‘pros’ need the ‘antis’. Vibrationis the realm of illusion and to vibrate you need to create a rhythm, a beat thatoscillates between two points, as a pendulum needs to swing between two pointsor it must be still. How can a pendulum swing if it only has one point? Forevery ‘to’ there has to be a ‘fro’ and vice versa. Without the two points therecan only be stillness (the Infinite). The Matrix is illusory duality and thedivision of the One. Look at the laser beam that has to be divided into two forthe holographic pattern to be produced. Thought, too, is illusion. Thinking isnot being, just as believing is not knowing. Our loss of awareness of the Onemeans that we have to recognise everything by differences. We know what is hotbecause we know what is cold; we know what is loud because we know what isquiet. Without the dualities to compare, everything would just be. The realm ofvibrational illusion depends for its very existence on polarity, duality, andthe whole agenda of the Matrix is to maintain the illusion of polarity in allthings. People have said to me that I am a ‘good man’. But I am not ‘good’, Ijust am. A ‘good man’ is a polarity. Others have said I am a ‘bad man’. But I amnot ‘bad’, I just am. A bad man is a polarity that provides the oscillationpoint to vibrate with the good man. Polarities are Matrix illusions.Keep taking the tablets (it’s good for business)The pharmaceutical cartel is one of the major arms of the Illuminati and itmakes multi-billions a year from the illusion that drugs actually heal people.But how can they do that, except by planting a belief that they do? The body isa holographic illusion of the mind. How can it possibly be healed by a pill orpotion that is only another illusion? ‘Pills’ are frequency fields that canaffect the frequency field of the body hologram – but even then only if we thinkthey can. Hey, but what about the ayahuasca and other psychoactives that havetaken me into altered states? They, too, only work because I believe they will.The trick is going into these other realms without external stimulus because wecan do that if it is our reality. In the second session of the ayahuasca inBrazil the voice said to me:> “Do you think you are experiencing this because of a plant? Illusion.> Ayahuasca is an illusion because plants are illusions. Your mind altered> itself because it believed in the plant.” This would explain how I was able on the first night to snap out of the deeplyaltered state the moment the voice spoke the words “it is over for tonight”. Theeffect should have lasted for far longer, but my mind intervened in the illusionand changed it. I felt ill when I took the ayahuasca simply because that is theeffect I believed it would have. In other altered states I have been able toreturn to five-sense reality in a flash. How could this be possible if it wasthe substance that was really controlling the experience? Someone with multiplepersonality disorder can be drugged in one mode and unaffected in another, as wehave seen. Funnily enough, a few minutes after I wrote the above I was skimmingthrough a book when I saw a reference to people in LSD trials that were given afake dose or ‘placebo’ and yet still ‘tripped’ for hours just like those who hadtaken the real LSD. Richard Alpert, a psychologist at Harvard, who later becameknown as the mystic, Ram Dass, told another relevant story on this same theme.He was travelling near the Himalayas researching the affects of LSD. A ‘holyman’ in his sixties asked him for a large dose of LSD and increased it stillfurther until it was massive, some four times greater than experienced‘trippers’. But he was playing with Alpert. The LSD had no effect on him becausehe knew it was an illusion and if that was his reality that had to be hisexperience.8The placebo is a wonderful example of the power of the mind to make itsillusions ‘real’. Fake pills are used to placate people who demand drugs notdeemed to be necessary and they are also used in trials to test the effect ofdrugs in what are called ‘double-blinds’ like that LSD experiment. Half thepeople are given the ‘real’ drug and half the placebo. The power of the placeboto heal people is extraordinary and some have even become addicted to them! Thereason is familiar by now – belief. Another form of placebo is to cut peopleopen in the operating theatre and sew them up again without doing anything tothem. One such trial in the 1950s on patients with angina pectoris showed thatthe ‘open and shut’ placebo patients had as much relief as those who were giventhe normal surgery. Doctors have ‘cured’ a stream of complaints with a placebo,including warts that have disappeared when a purple dye was applied to them. Thepatients thought the dye was a treatment, but it wasn’t, it was a placebo.Remember how people with multiple personalities can have warts in some altersand not in others? The accounts abound of the placebo effect, like the man whowas given a drug for asthma and improved immediately only for the doctor to betold later that he had been sent placebos by mistake and not the real drug. Eventhe enthusiasm of the doctor about a placebo’s effect can make a significantdifference to the outcome because it gives the patient more assurance that it isgoing to work. People given a placebo in double-blind tests for chemotherapydrugs have lost their hair just like those taking the real thing.One of the most famous placebo stories was recounted by a psychologist, BrunoKlopfer, about a guy called Wright, who was suffering from an extremely advancedlymphatic cancer that was all over his body. He was in a terrible state. Indesperation, Wright asked his doctor to give him a new drug called Krebiozenthat was undergoing trials. His doctor saw no point, but he eventually relented.He gave Wright the drug on a Friday and fully expected to find that he had diedwhen he returned after the weekend. Instead, Wright was out of bed with thetumours half their size and within ten days of taking the drug he was declaredcancer free. It was a miracle, it seemed. All was fine for two months untilWright read articles that Krebiozen was not proving successful in the treatmentof cancer. What happened? His cancer came back. His doctor now understood whatwas happening and assured him that the failed trials were from a faulty batchand that he had the real deal that worked. This time he gave him an injection ofwater (injections tend to work better as placebos because they are perceived tobe more powerful than tablets). Wright’s cancer disappeared once more foranother two months until the American Medical Association issued a statementsaying that Krebiozen had no effect on cancer. There was now no escape forWright’s mind and he died two days later.9‘Genetic disease’ = inherited realityThe latest ‘in’ topic in medicine is genetic disease. Some women are even havingtheir perfectly healthy breasts removed because they have been told they have a‘cancer gene’ that dramatically increases their likelihood of breast cancer. Howinsane can you get? But look at the daily bombardment through the media of scarestories about new threats of disease or dangers to our health. How many peopledevelop these health problems because the possibility is planted in their mindsin this way? Fantastic numbers worldwide, I have no doubt. We must allow humancloning because it can help to ‘fight’ genetic disease, we are told. But thereis no need. Genetic disease, like all the others, is illusion! It is theinherited programming of the body hologram and we are more powerful than that ifwe choose to access and use that power. There are published examples of peoplebeing cured of genetic disease through hypnosis and of course that is possiblebecause it is rewiring the reality of the mind and the inherited reality of theDNA. That is what ‘DNA disease’ really is – an inherited reality! How many morepeople suffer and die from a genetic disease only because some ignorant doctorsays they have the ‘gene’ that makes them more likely to develop the problem? Idread to think. How often do we hear that a disease or complaint “runs in thefamily”? Yes, it runs in the family because the family thinks it runs in them.The inherited programming/disease that is passed on through the family becomestheir body/mind reality and so they can manifest that. They are not passing on agenetic flaw to the next generation, they are passing on their DNA’s belief inthe genetic flaw. Again, all this is happening at subconscious as well asconscious levels. Look how doctors describe to their patients the prognosis ofan ‘incurable’ disease and the ever-worsening stages through which it will go.What happens? It does – if the patient accepts that belief. Alzheimer sufferersare one example of this and the same with Parkinson’s disease. If the mind ofthe patient believes what the doctor says then that is what will happen. “See,the doctor was right.” No! The doctor has often programmed the patient’s mind tobelieve that scenario and therefore it happens. It is sobering to ponder on theeffect of this process in places like America where the doctor is held in suchunquestioning awe. I have met some of these guys and what havoc they wreak. Alittle knowledge may be a dangerous thing, but no knowledge is lethal. This isthe reverse of the placebo – believing ourselves ill.More mind over ‘matter’The ‘mystery’ of stigmata, when people bleed through their hands and feet like‘Jesus’ on the cross, is another potent expression of the power of the mind overthe illusory body. Christianity has presented stigmata as “it’s a sign, a sign”.A sign of what, though? Of ‘Jesus’? No, a sign of the person’s belief. In theclassic stigmata experience the blood flows from holes in the hands because thatis the way that ‘Jesus’ has been portrayed on the cross in the paintings andstatues, etc. But the hands cannot support the body in this way and the Romansbanged the nails into the wrists of those they crucified. That is not, however,the reality of the stigmata experiencer and it is their reality that their mindsmake ‘real’. Many times the blood flows down the feet to the toes even when theypoint their toes to the sky because their programmed reality recreates the waythey believe the blood flowed when ‘Jesus’ was on the cross. How can the bloodovercome the laws of gravity? As I said earlier, gravity is an illusion becausethere are no laws unless we believe there are. When you have advanced cancersdisappearing because someone believes a useless treatment will work and skinblemishes disappear because the patient believes in the power of a uselesspurple dye, what is the big deal any more about people with a profound religiousbelief manifesting the central symbols of their religion? It is not mind overmatter because there is no matter. It is mind over illusion. Once again thepower of the belief and the manifestation as stigmata comes from thesubconscious level.Experiments with soldiers and others have shown that people do not get tiredbecause of how far they have walked so much as how far they think they havewalked or how far they think they still have to go. The mind tells the body itis tired. The body is an illusion and can never get tired until we tell it tobe. Neither do we need sleep. We just believe we do and so we go Zzzzzzz. Thereare people who don’t sleep at all and they are perfectly OK. Does the Infiniteget knackered or go off to the land of nod? My daughter Kerry was a brilliantrunner when she was younger, but I remember one night when she was reallystruggling in a middle distance race. She looked tired and was off the pace backin something like seventh position with the leaders way ahead. Suddenly, on thelast bend with the finishing tape in sight, she produced the most amazing finishI have seen. She overtook runner after runner and missed winning the race byliterally an inch or two. Her mind had been telling her body it should be tiredbecause that was her perception early in the race with several laps to go andthe pace hot, right from the gun. But once she saw the finish line, even thoughshe had run so far already, her mind knew it was almost over and she was able toproduce a tremendous sprint finish from 200 metres out when the body illusionresponded to her change of mind, change of reality. Sportsmen and women producewhat appear to be incredible performances, but they are primitive compared withwhat they could be doing if they truly understood their power to create whateverreality they believe in. Look at how many sporting barriers, like thefour-minute mile, take so long to overcome, but once it has happened many othersdo the same and it becomes commonplace. The barriers are mental, not physical,because there is no physical. Once someone has shown that a feat is possible,the mental barrier dissolves in others and they can also do it.Healthy eating?Speaking of sports and such, we need exercise to maintain a healthy body and weneed to eat a balanced diet, right? Well, yes, but only if we think we do. Ifthe body is a holographic illusion, how can it benefit or otherwise fromexercise or this or that type of food? But if you eat lots of fatty food youwill get heart disease, I’ve read it many times. First of all that research isnot necessarily the ‘proven fact’ it claims to be and, second, the heart is anillusion and so are the bacon, egg, sausage and fries swimming in the fat. Anillusion cannot affect an illusion unless we think it can. Of course it can’t.But the body must need nutrition, surely? No, only if you believe it does. Whatabout diets? Do people lose weight or not because of the diet or because theybelieve or disbelieve in its effectiveness? The latter, it has to be. Whetheryour body is a thin illusion or a fat illusion is down to your own mind and itsability overcome its own conditioning and that of its inherited hologram thatcarries programming through the DNA. “But I drink lots of beer, eat lots ofchips and scoff bars of chocolate, so I am bound to get fat.” Why? That is whatyou are told; that is what you believe; and that is what you make ‘real’. I amnot saying we should eat certain fatty foods for the sake of it or spend ourdays with the feet up on the sofa watching the soaps and sport all day, anduntil people can disconnect from consensus reality and their body programming itis far better to eat well rather than consume the crap the system bombards uswith. I am just saying that food doesn’t affect your health unless yourbody/mind believes it does and when we can free our minds of that programming itdoesn’t matter what, or even if, we eat. What about Therese Neumann who didn’teat for 35 years and maintained her health and weight? She should have died inweeks. She didn’t die and she didn’t become emaciated because it was not herreality.Physician heal thyselfThere is no need for a medical system when we understand the full magnitude ofwho we are and the way we create reality. Why do we need surgery when what is‘inside’ of us is a holographic illusion that we can change anytime we want? Theman called Wright might have been treated for his cancer by removing largeamounts of his cancerous tissue. Yet when he believed a useless drug would beeffective, the areas of his body that might have been surgically removed healedthemselves. The man with the seriously broken leg healed by the kahuna wouldhave normally had surgery and been in a plaster cast for months. Instead he washealed in minutes. The Illuminati pharmaceutical cartel is making multi-billionsby selling us drugs that don’t work unless we believe they do and killing us byplanting the belief that they have not yet come up with a cure for something wethink we have and “nothing can be done”. Their drugs are also having unpleasant,often terrible, side effects when we believe that they do. How many people getthe side effects after they have read about them on the side of the bottle orfrom their doctor? How many people get addicted to heroin or cocaine becausethey are told these are seriously addictive drugs? They can’t be. They areillusions, just like the bodies that become addicted. How many smokers die oflung cancer because they are told that is what smoking does to you? We will takecontrol of our own ‘health’ only when we realise that we are in control of it.Doctors and their masters in the drug cartel need to be erased from our realityon all levels.Most of our belief and sense of reality about doctors and health – and allreality – comes from subconscious programming that we are not even aware of.This is where we lock in most powerfully to the collective consensus realitythat effects us so fundamentally. I know that the wall I am looking at now andthe chair I am sitting on are illusions. I know it is all illusion. But I amstill connected enough to the consensus reality to see the world around me as3-D ‘solid’ like everyone else and I can stop my bum falling through thisillusory seat. To withdraw completely from consensus reality, I have to let myunderstanding of the illusion pervade all my levels of consciousness and reach astate that I can only describe as ‘knowing’ or ‘being’. Shit, my bum has justsmacked on the floor. Oh, but there is no floor … aaaahhhhhh! Hold on, there isno me, either, so how can I fall through the chair and the floor? I can’t. Phew,that’s all right then. Now, where was I? Everywhere, the only place I can everbe. OK, back there then. But I can’t go back, ‘cos I am already everywhere.(Dave, get on with it before you disappear up your own backside.) But I don’thave a backside, it’s an illusion, so how can I disappear up it? See where youcan go with this??Alternative illusions (but more enlightened ones!)The gathering distrust of the scalpel and drug medical system has led to anexplosion in those seeking help from what is called ‘alternative’ or‘complementary’ medicine. This includes an almost endless list of techniques andtherapies, including aromatherapy, reflexology, acupuncture, cranial therapy,Reiki, oxygen therapy, colour therapy, sound healing, homoeopathy, crystaltherapy, on and on it goes. These methods can by-pass the system in that theyaim to rebalance the vibrational fields of the patient that have been imbalancedby their mental and emotional state and/or other vibrational influences. Thiscan be extremely effective in healing dis-ease, but unless the patient’s mind,emotions and/or environment changes, the imbalances will return. I have beensaying for years that alternative healing therapies, as with an understanding ofastrology, psychic phenomena, etc., are stepping-stones to the realisation thatthey are illusions, too. But they are a vitally important bridge that can leadus out of the physical illusion, the densest and most imprisoning of all, andhelp people to begin the reality shift. This ‘alternative’ area can, however,also be a trap if people believe they have found ‘it’ and such is the case withthousands of people I have met around the world. As with astrology and much ofthe New Age, these alternative forms of healing work with the realm ofvibration. Almost all of them are based on balancing vibrations and energy byusing other vibrations and energy. Acupuncture balances energy with its needles;aromatherapy with the vibration of smell; colour therapy with the vibration ofcolour; sound healing with the vibration of sound; Reiki with energy through thehands; crystal therapy with the vibration of the crystal; and homoeopathy withthe vibration of plants. This is why the homoeopaths dilute the substance of theplant or flower. It is the vibration they are working with, not its ‘physical’form.The alternatives understand that everything is a vibrational field and that thephysical body is vibrating energy. But if it vibrates it is still illusion,still trapped in the Matrix. While alternative therapies are a big advance onthe primitive beliefs of the medical establishment, they are only astepping-stone to the realisation that all is created by thought and so all canbe healed by thought. The more people turn to these alternatives and believethemselves to health, the more strongly others will believe from this evidencethat they can be healed and more will. Belief is self-perpetuating because itcreates an alternative consensus reality. In an altered state, I was looking atthe vibrant colours around me. “Do you think those colours are real”, said thevoice. “They are vibrations and so they are illusions.” Colour, it said, is onlywhat we think we see. “How can the illusion of colour affect the illusion of thebody?” Only if we, at some level, think it can. When I got home I recounted thisstory and a few seconds after I finished I walked into another room to be facedwith the front cover of a magazine headlined “Colour Therapy – rainbowremedies”. And what are rainbows? Illusions. These alternatives are doing animportant job in teasing people out of the densest illusion, but we need to keepmoving to avoid this alternative trap. The mastery of our own reality is therevelation that will open the prison door. New Age thinking and alternativetherapies can lead people towards the door, but they can’t take them through.Only we can do that.Switching off the treesThere is nothing that cannot be explained once we realise that Infinite Love(Oneness) is the only truth and everything else is illusion; and that we arecreating the illusion or having the illusion programmed into to us by believingit to be real. Lyall Watson, the biologist and author of Supernature, tells ofwatching an Indonesian woman called Tia, a shaman in training, talking to asmall girl in a grove of trees. He looked from a little distance away and shedid not know he was there. She seemed to be explaining something to the girl anda sort of ritual of dance and gesture began. To Watson’s amazement, the grove ofkenari trees disappeared and a few seconds later came back again. “One momentTia danced in a grove of shady kenari; the next she was standing alone in thehard, bright light of the Sun”, he said.10 She proceeded to ‘switch’ the groveon and off several times as Watson looked on incredulously. This is impossiblesurely? No it’s not. The grove is a holographic illusion and those with anunderstanding of how the process works can disconnect from that reality, theconsensus dream that agrees the grove exists. With Lyall Watson observing thisscene intently it was easy for him to become part of Tia’s reality field andalso see the grove appear and disappear. Someone else might have watched thisfrom the illusion of consensus reality and the grove would not have disappearedto them. This is how some people can walk through walls – they believe they canand that becomes their experience. They disconnect their mind and body from thelaws of consensus reality that insists this is impossible. When I say ‘believe’,it is a level of belief that is beyond any words that just say ‘I believe’. Itis not belief, it is a knowing, a being. There is that age old saying that sayswe can ‘move mountains’. They can’t mean literally? Why not? If a tree grove candisappear, why not a mountain? The mountain is a holographic illusion and ourminds control the illusion. Why can’t we move mountains? We can, but we don’t,because we don’t know we can. Consensus, programmed, reality says the very ideais ridiculous and if we buy that reality, it is.Haunted by ourselvesThere is the apparent mystery of ghosts, apparitions and poltergeists, but arethey really so mysterious? On the Isle of Wight where I live in England thereare ghost stories galore of people who claim to have seen figures who come andgo wearing the clothes of other centuries. There can be many reasons for this.It could be a formerly incarnate mind that is so attached to that experience –that illusion – that it continues to ‘live it’ even after its body hologram has‘died’. It manifests another illusory body through residual self-image, just asthose who have had near-death and out-of-body experiences report doing. Thesesubstitute ‘bodies’ are much less dense than the five-sense hologram and appear,disappear, and move around in a way that seems impossible to a five-senseobserver. But the observer is seeing another level of reality and possibility.Other ghosts and the sights and sounds of ancient battles that people say theyhave seen and heard can also be the memory of the battle, the recording if youlike, imprinted as a thought form in the energy field. By unknowingly observingthis, their minds bring it into holographic reality like a laser light shiningon the holographic print. They ‘see’ soldiers fighting in the uniforms ofhistory and hear the sounds of the carnage. Such a place is said to be‘haunted’, but it is better described as the ultimate holographic drive-inmovie. Battles and wars are especially effective in imprinting these vibrationalmemory fields because emotion is a major factor in the creation of reality andthe power of the illusion. You find many ghost stories and accounts of hauntingsare connected to murders, violence and suffering of some kind, and other eventsof high emotion. These memory imprints – ‘hauntings’ – are often observed atparticular times in the year and this seems to be connected to other energy andvibrational cycles that activate them and allow them to be to be seen and heardmore powerfully. W. Y. Evans-Wentz spent two years early in the 20th centurytravelling through ‘Celtic’ Britain, Ireland and Brittany in France interviewingpeople who had experienced the ‘supernatural’. In his book, The Fairy-Faith inCeltic Countries,11 he includes dozens of accounts from people who had seenghostly conflicts and battles with soldiers in armour or uniforms from the‘past’. Some scenes were silent, some had the noise of battle and others wereonly heard. Evans-Wentz concluded:> “Nature herself has a memory. There is some indefinable psychic element in the> Earth’s atmosphere upon which all human and physical actions or phenomena are> photographed or impressed. Under certain inexplicable conditions, normal> persons who are not seers may observe Nature’s mental records like pictures> cast upon a screen – often like moving pictures.” 12 This phenomenon is no longer inexplicable, however. They are memories recordedin the energy field that are observed into holographic reality. Poltergeistactivity has been widely reported as families being terrified by some force thatmoves objects, turns on taps, switches electrical equipment on and off, andsometimes hurls things around the room. But is this really, or always, an ‘evilspirit’ at work? Many common themes have been identified in poltergeist activitythat have led researchers to believe the ‘culprit’ is the mind or minds of thosebeing ‘haunted’. Often the activity is connected to teenagers, especially girls,going through a period of emotional stress. The external phenomenon is aholographic mirror of what is going on with the person emotionally. Everythingis connected to everything else because everything is everything. This appliesto apparently ‘dead’ objects like cups, lamps and ash trays. They are reallyvibrational fields and at that level they can be moved by other vibrationalinfluences – the minds of people. In turn, these vibrational fields are turnedinto 3-D holographic ‘reality’ by being observed. The minds of people, say ateenage girl, unknowingly interact with the ‘inanimate’ objects on the level ofthe frequency fields as they express their emotional state at that subconsciouslevel of reality. But they consciously ‘see’ the result of this at theirconscious level of reality – the five-senses – with the objects moving andflying about the room. Understandably they scream in terror, but they are doingit to themselves!!! When they calm themselves emotionally, their five-sensereality calms down and the ‘poltergeist’ moves on!There is an important point to stress here. I have just described how thesubconscious level of the girl imprints a vibrational field with her thoughtsand emotions (reality) and her conscious five-sense level observes that fieldinto holographic illusion. This is the process by which we all constantly createour own reality. Just as the teenage girl doesn’t realise in her consciousawareness that she is creating the poltergeist activity with her subconsciousmind, people in general don’t realise that their observed reality – their‘lives’ – are only a mirror of their subconscious reality.Me and my car are overheatingThe interaction of mind and machine is another mystery easily explained when werealise that both are One. The mind and its holographic illusion are the samebecause observed and observer is the same. This being so, mind and machine musteffect each other when they are each other. When we are stressed and anxious toget somewhere fast and urgently, how many times does the car break down? When weare desperate and stressed to finish something on the computer how often doesthe computer go wrong? The more stressed and emotional we get the morepowerfully we are interacting with the vibrational field blueprint of the‘physical’ object and the more likely it is that we will pass our imbalance –our sense of reality – on to the ‘object’. In the years after I bought my firstcar I was going through a time of enormous emotional stress. I was in emotionaloverload. I had a series of cars of different makes and states of mechanicalcompetence over these years and yet every one developed the same problem –overheating! It got to the point where every time I went on a journey of anydistance I would worry about the car overheating. Of course, this added to thepower of the reality and … the car overheated. Once I passed through thisemotional phase my cars stopped overheating. I had a call from a friend once whosaid she wanted to come up the motorway to see me and others because she was soemotionally stressed. Half an hour later she called again. She was delayedbecause her car had overheated on the way over. If we are emotionally andmentally stressed and imbalanced, so must be the 3-D illusion that our minds andemotions in that state are creating. That mental and emotional state willsymbolise itself in the holographic illusion we manifest and the people andexperiences involved. A calm and peaceful consciousness will create a calm andpeaceful illusion. This is why I say that you do not fight for peace, you peacefor peace.Got the time, mate?Past, present and future are happening together? That’s ridiculous, surely. Butit’s not. Unless, of course, you think it is, in which case it will not happenin your reality. We don’t go back to the past or forward to the future. We don’tgo anywhere because we are already everywhere. There is no time and there is nospace. A subatomic particle too ‘small’ to be seen can hold all the informationcontained in the cosmos because it is not ‘small’; it only appears to be. Sizeis an illusion – just as I tell my wife. The particle is the cosmos, as a cellis the body and contains all the information to ‘clone’ a replica. Every cell isalso everything. How can the Infinite One be travelling from ‘past’ to ‘future’when it is already all that is and can ever be? Past, present and future arejust different realities. You have a reality of the world right now and someoneelse will have another. They are different realities, but we have no problemaccepting that they are happening simultaneously. All I am saying is that it isthe same with the past, present and future. They are different realitieshappening together. But don’t we travel from past to future every day? No, you‘travel’ from reality to reality. I hear many of those that recognise the ‘past’can be accessed describing this process as attuning with thevibrational/holographic memory of the ‘past’ from our point in the ‘present’. Idon’t agree with that, a massive stretch of our perception as this may be. Wedon’t go back to the ‘past’ because there is only NOW. Past, present and futureare different realities happening together in the same NOW. I would go further,fantastic as I know it will sound. There are not even sequences in which oneaction follows another. That, too, is illusion. I did not write the last chapterbefore this one. I am writing both in the same NOW and you are reading it as Iam writing it. It is my awareness of one and not the other that gives me theimpression that one follows the other. My reality changes with my changingfocus. When I thought I was writing the last chapter I was actually in the samenow that I am in as I write this one. Only my awareness of the two realities haschanged. There is no after and there is no before. There is only NOW. Wow, Iknow the feeling: “Hello backside here I come.” This is something you have tojust know. If you think about it, you disappear up the orifice. The concept of‘memory’ is another illusion that accepts the existence of past time. How couldpast time not exist if we have a memory of it? But memory is not recall from the‘past’, it is accessing information stored in another reality experience in theeternal NOW. And what is this ‘past’ and ‘future’? How many different realitiesof the ‘present’ exist on Earth ‘today’? As many as there are minds. Yes, thereis the consensus reality, but there are endless variations on this. It is thesame with the ‘past’ and ‘future’ realities. So what is real? Whatever you thinkit is. ‘Reincarnation’, then, is not a process of coming in and out of this‘world’ over ‘time’. It is moving in and out of different realities allhappening at once. It is the same with the ‘recording’ of the ghostly battles Iwas talking about. Because there is no ‘time’, the ‘recording’ or ‘memory’ isactually the battle happening in another reality in the same NOW as the peopleobserving it ‘centuries’ later.One of the greatest mysteries is how it is possible to predict the ‘future’,which endless studies have shown to be the case. One example is the ‘chair test’devised by the Dutch psychic, Gerard Croiset. Investigators would identifypublic events in halls across the world that did not have pre-assigned seating.People sat wherever they chose when they arrived. The investigator would giveCroiset a particular seat to focus on weeks in advance and he would have todescribe the person who would sit there at the event. For some 25 years Croisetdescribed the occupants of the seats with incredible accuracy. Dr Jule Eisenbud,clinical professor at the University of Colorado, conducted one of these testsin 1969. More than two weeks before an event in Denver, Colorado, Eisenbudcontacted Croiset in Holland and gave him a seat to ‘read’. Croiset said the manwho would sit in that chair was about five-feet-nine and worked in industry andscience. In his job, said Croiset, he wore a laboratory coat that was stained bya greenish chemical. He said the man had black hair, brushed back, a scar on hisbig toe and a gold tooth in his lower jaw. Seventeen days later this very mansat in the seat and Croiset was correct in every detail, including his height offive feet nine and three quarters.13 How is this possible? The man in the chairand the man ‘before’ he even knew he was going to that theatre, were nothappening weeks apart. They were happening together. They were differentrealities of mind in the Infinite NOW.Slaves to the clockTo hold us in the illusion, the Illuminati/Matrix condition us to believe intime. When we fall for this, we disconnect from ‘no time’ – our Infinite state.The movement of the planets, Sun and Moon, night and day and ‘aging bodies’ areall designed to sell the illusion of moving from past to future. Look at the waythe clock governs our lives and the whole of society. Up at this time, out atthat time, leave at this time, arrive at that time. Have you got the time? Doyou know the time? What time does it start? What time does it finish? Thanks foryour time. I could be some time. I might be a long time. There’s not enough‘time’. I have too much time. We are slaves to time. But what is this ‘time’. Itis the creation and measurement of an illusion constructed to fool and controlus. The meridian system of ‘time’ based on the imaginary line through Londonknown as ‘Greenwich Mean Time’ was introduced by the Illuminati in 1884 and itwas from the Illuminati-controlled Vatican that Pope Gregory XIII commissionedthe Gregorian calendar in 1582 (see my other books). This was introduced by moreand more countries who accepted the new measurement of ‘time’ until it becamethe ‘norm’. To make it fit, the British Calendar Act of 1751 declared that 12days of the following year would not exist and that the day after Wednesday,September 2nd 1752 would be Thursday, September 14th. See how silly the idea of‘time’ really is? However you seek to measure ‘time’ it will always be anillusion because the concept of time is an illusion.Everyone has linked their sense of reality to the movement of the Sun and Moon,night and day, and almost everyone to 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in anhour, 24 hours in a day. This is a reality prison that holds us in disconnectedillusion. It is so ridiculous that you can go to two events and attend thesecond before the first by crossing the imaginary international dateline andgoing ‘backwards’ in ‘time’. The movement of the Matrix-created planets andother spheres and objects have a powerful influence on our belief in time andalso the frequency of our vibrational fields. It is well known that people areeffected by the full Moon, but these effects go much deeper, as an experiment byFrank Brown of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois confirmed. Heshipped live oysters from Long Island Sound, California, a thousand miles to hislaboratory in Illinois to study the effects on their biorhythm. The oysters wereexcellent subjects because they open and close with the tides. At first theymaintained the rhythm of the Long Island tides, but in around two weeks theybegan to change and they opened and closed in sync with the passage of the Moonover Evanston, Illinois.14 We are being influenced in the same way by the Sun,Moon and the planets, and this, of course, is the foundation of astrology. Thesevibrational fields serve the Matrix magnificently in imposing their frequencieson us and confirming that ‘time’ exists when it does not.The no-time zoneI had an experience as a footballer that made me question the nature of time. Iwas playing in a game one night in London when a guy smashed a shot from quiteclose range. I can recall the experience clearly. I saw him strike the ball innormal speed and it was moving so fast I was sure it was going to beat me. Butas I moved towards the ball everything went into slow motion and all sounddisappeared. I dived to my left and pushed my hand towards the ball, still inslow-mo. Then, as the ball struck my hand and deflected over the bar, everythingsurged back into ‘real’ time and the noise crashed back also as I returned tofive-sense reality. I lay on the ground as my team mates congratulated me, but Iwas in a daze. What the hell just happened? I now know that I entered anotherreality that was not subject to the ‘laws’ of this one. Sports people often talkabout entering the ‘zone’ when there seems to be no time and no noise. In thisstate, they say, they can perform at their peak. They access a subconsciousstate that is untroubled by the doubt and fear of failure that is such a traitof the five-sense self.We only have to observe our own experience to see how ‘time’ is relative and notmeasurable. Sit in a dentist’s waiting room and see how slow ‘time’ seems topass. But do something you really enjoy and it seems to pass so quickly, as itdoes if you are chasing a deadline. When I worked at a radio station reading thenews live on the hour, I would often still be in the newsroom two minutes beforethe start writing a story or waiting for one. I realised that if I got stressfuland anxious those two minutes would pass very quickly, but if I stayed calm theypassed much slower. In truth, they didn’t ‘pass’ at all and the speed that theyappeared to pass was only an illusion of my reality. Albert Einstein put it likethis: “When you spend two hours with a nice girl, you think it’s only a minute.But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute, you think its two hours.” Howoften have you had a ‘long dream’ in which a great deal happened, only to findthat you have only been asleep for a few minutes? People who have experiencedthe near-death phenomenon recall how they had a ‘life review’ in which they saweverything that happened in their life in an instant. How come? There is notime; it is one of the major illusions that ensnares our reality. Those who haveleft their bodies speak of being in a place of ‘no time’, but others havedescribed other realms with different time-tracks. The voice in Brazil told methat the other levels of the Matrix have versions of time that are different toours and can appear to be no-time when they are not. When I went into the ‘zone’in that football match, time slowed dramatically, but there was still thefeeling of ‘time’.Oh yes, I see it now …From the perspective I am outlining in this book, ‘mysteries’ of every kindbecome perfectly logical even for the conditioned mind. Here are a few moreexamples: Telepathy is one ‘mind’ attuning with another ‘mind’, which allowsboth to link, so think, together. Both minds are actually one and there is nospace between them, only the Infinite that seamlessly connects everything toeverything because it is everything. Remote viewing, where people go in theirminds to observe other locations, is possible because the viewer is both hereand everywhere. Remote viewers don’t ‘go’ anywhere, like A to B, with theirminds. They attune their minds to the reality they wish to observe and thatconnects with them. Much of what we call mental illness is when people operatein a different reality to the ‘norm’ and appear strange in their behaviour andunable to relate to the ‘world’ the rest of the population think they live in.Schizophrenia is when people switch between holographic realities, the same asthose with multiple personality disorder do. Aura reading is communication withthe human energy field, the conscious and subconscious mind. It is thesubconscious that instigates a course of action before the conscious mind‘decides’ what to do. If you attune with the subconscious you can read itsreality and predict what is likely to happen when this becomes five-sensereality. But once again, hard as it is for most people to grasp, it is allhappening in the same NOW. Tarot card reading is another form of this. Each ofthe cards represents a certain vibrational state and when we choose the cardsapparently at random our vibrational state is attracted to its representation onthe cards. This makes us choose one card rather than another. It’s a sort ofmagnetism. ‘Mind readers’ are those who attune into the consciousness of peopleand astound their subjects by telling them facts about themselves they could notpossibly know. But, of course, they can know if they can read the vibrationalfields that hold that information. I appeared heavily disguised on a televisionprogramme once in which an aura reader and a tarot card reader had to guess whoI was and give the audience background information about me. They didexcellently and both said I was about to go on a long journey to the Far East.The aura reader actually mentioned Japan. I was extremely impressed because Iwas due to go to Japan. This knowledge was in my mind, my energy field, andavailable to be ‘read’. However, circumstances changed and I did not actuallygo. Had they accessed deeper levels of my subconscious mind they would haveknown that.The information I have detailed in this section of the book holds the key tohuman freedom in that it exposes the illusion we think is ‘real’ and reveals howwe can change it. More than that, this knowledge is the very foundation on whichthe control and manipulation of humanity (and all in the Matrix) is based. Thebottom line of the Illuminati agenda is the manipulation of humanity’simagination of itself – its sense of reality. Control that and, for reasons hereexplained, you control the ‘physical’ outcome.SOURCES > 1 The Holographic Universe, pp 33 and 34> 2 Ralph W.

Wright Mills Control of this reality is control of the mind-game through which reality iscreated. We can either give our minds away to the constant conditioning of oursense of self and the world or we can cease to feed those delusions and manifestour own reality. That is the difference between existing in slavery and livingin freedom.Understanding how we are programmed to believe in the consensus ‘Matrix’ realityis vital to cutting the chains that bind us to the prevailing illusion. In thischapter I will explore the techniques used to manipulate that sense of reality.It is testament to the power of consciousness that anyone at all has awoken fromtheir manipulated dream, especially in the ‘developed’ world of mass media andindoctrination. But they have and the numbers are exploding across the globebecause the influence of Illuminati programming is no match for the power ofconsciousness in awareness of that power.Trance-formingIt is essential to the outcome the Illuminati desire that they maintain thepopulation in ignorance of our true nature while planting messages into theconscious, and especially subconscious, mind to program the reality that suitsthe agenda. It is nothing less than hypnotism. All except a few of the sixbillion people on this planet are held in an hypnotic state, a trance, a spell,as they move zombie-like from conditioned thought to conditioned response andthe conditioning is so total that they believe they are making free decisionsand choices. Wilson Bryan Key rightly says in his book, The Age of Manipulation:“Once the group or collective unconscious is programmed into what has beencalled culture, virtually any bill of goods can be sold at conscious levels.”1The Matrix consciousness and its Illuminati manifestation know the process ofcreating reality. Society, therefore, has been structured to maintain theillusion. The subconscious is where the thought patterns are generated that theconscious mind observes into holographic ‘reality’; and the subconscious, withits language of symbolism and metaphor, is the Illuminati’s prime target to beconditioned in many subtle and less subtle ways. One example is the massiveincrease in the number of speed cameras in Britain. Millions of motorists arebeing caught because their mind wanders for a moment and they are snapped a fewmiles an hour over the limit. This brings in enormous amounts of money in finesthat the government says is being spent on introducing more cameras. Talk aboutpaying for your own prison. The subconscious message of this system is “don’trelax for a second because Big Brother’s eyes are everywhere”. When the policeletter arrives with a picture of your car and threats for not doing exactly asdemanded, the subconscious implant of “do as we say, we are in control of yourlife” is still further re-enforced. The whole process happens without the driverseeing a single human being. They send you a leaflet with a list of questionsthey think you might ask. The answer to every one is basically “there’s nothingyou can do”. One of them asks if it makes any difference that you have a perfectdriving record with no previous convictions for car offences of any kind. Isthis taken into account? The answer is: “Speed cameras do not discriminate,everyone is treated the same.” That is the idea. The Illuminati want to removeas much human involvement as possible so there is no weighing of thecircumstances, no taking every case on its merits. This is how it is, end ofstory. Doing five miles an hour over the speed limit in dense traffic is treatedthe same as doing the same speed on the same stretch of road at three in themorning when there is no other vehicle in sight. The letters you receive areworded to imprint fear to illicit the desired response. It suggests you could befined thousands of pounds if the case goes to court, but they offer you thechance of paying a fixed penalty of £60! All the time the subconscious isgetting the message “you are under our control” and the idea is to program thatreality so deeply that the person ceases to rebel and accepts what he or shebelieves is the inevitable. The obsession with ‘political correctness’ is also amethod of subconscious thought control, as I will discuss later. Politicalcorrectness is saying to the subconscious “we are watching every word you say”.Looking without seeingThe targeting of the subconscious is behind the bombardment of subliminalmessages coming at us from all angles and they aim to manipulate behaviourthrough human ‘drives’ like survival (hunger, thirst, danger of all kinds); sex,greed, social acceptance, security and territoriality (a big drive of thereptilian brain). Subliminal means ‘below threshold’ because the messages arecommunicated at a level that the conscious mind doesn’t register, but thesubconscious certainly does. The subconscious sees all while the conscious notesonly a fraction of what passes through the eyes and even changes much of that.Subliminal advertising was exposed in the 1950s when some television and movietheatre ads were found to be transmitting split-second images that the consciousmind couldn’t see to stimulate a desire for a product. This included asubliminal “I’m thirsty” during drinks commercials. But the knowledge ofsubliminal programming goes back to ancient times with scholars like Plato andAristotle mentioning the phenomenon and more than 500 scientific papers havebeen published confirming the effectiveness of subliminals.2 Producers of movieslike The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre publicly admitted that theycontained violent and frightening subliminals.3 The use of subliminals issupposed to be illegal in some countries and the Illuminati-controlled Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) in the United States says that subliminalsare inherently deceptive because the consumer does not perceive them at a normallevel of awareness and is given no choice whether to accept or reject themessage. Funny then, that nothing is done about the subliminals that abound inadvertising, let alone in political manipulation. The US Federal CommunicationsCommission, currently headed by Colin Powell’s son, Michael, a Bush appointment,has no regulation barring subliminal advertising, but generally considers itdeceptive, it says. Again, why no action?Image [../Images/00060.jpg]Figure 54: Can you see the subliminal message in this image. Apparently about 5%of people see it immediately The picture in Figure 54 carries a very clear subliminal message, or at leastit’s clear when it’s pointed out. Can you see it? Apparently, about five percent see the subliminal at first sight and the rest are amazed when it is madeclear to them. If you haven’t seen it, look at the white areas and not theplants. Your eyes go to the plants, but it is most often in the background thatsubliminals are posted. We consciously see the apparent focus of the ad whilethe background passes us by. Look at the lower level of the two plants on theleft and you will see that they combine to make the letter S in the whitebackground. Move your eyes right and you’ll see an E and an X. Oh yes, ofcourse, I can see it now. Why couldn’t I see it before, it’s so obvious? Untilthe subliminal was explained, the conscious mind was not in the game, only thesubconscious. Once it is highlighted, the conscious mind registers the wordbecause it is no longer subliminal or below its threshold. Every time you lookat that picture from now on you will see that once-subliminal word immediately.It is crucial to communicate the manipulation techniques and methods of theIlluminati because once people understand how they work they are no longersubliminal and can be clearly identified.Hey, and guess what they call these subliminal additions to advertisements?Embeds! Yes, the choice of the term ‘embeds’ or ‘embedded’ for the journalistsassigned to military units is no accident. This is what those journalists reallyare – embedded distorters. They are subliminal embeds planted to give theappearance of journalism while merely reporting the official line. I have oftensaid that the Illuminati manipulate the people by manipulating the image theyhave of something, rather than with the detail. They know that people don’tretain detail from the television or even newspapers. They go away with animage, a feeling, about a person or event. Tell the people something over andover and at the level of the image, the feeling, they will overwhelmingly acceptthe image to be a true picture of events even though there is no detail to backit up. They keep repeating the same mantra over and over like ‘weapons of massdestruction’, “al-Qaeda was responsible”, and “it was Bin Laden”. This is simplehypnosis.I see no sexSexual themes are used in subliminal advertising on a monumental scale. Thesubliminal word ‘sex’ is incredibly common in advertisements, as is ‘fuck’.Contrary to what many assume, we are not a sexually open society, but aseriously sexually suppressed one. We are largely in denial of our sexuality andour desires, but much as people may wish to deny them they don’t go away.Denying something gives it more power over you and can become an obsession.People deny their sexual feelings because they are at odds with what the masshypocrisy dictates is ‘moral’ and ‘decent’. Stuff that. I have a simplephilosophy: do what you like so long as everyone involved has made a free choiceto be involved and there is no compulsion or manipulation to do so. Once thosecriteria are met, who cares what other people do? It’s no one’s business, buttheirs. For goodness sake, it’s all an illusion anyway. Is it immoral for anillusion to have sex with an illusion, even with more than one? What? “Ooh, Ithink it’s disgusting what those people next door get up to.” Well don’t do whatthey do then, darlin’. Most of the time, beyond the denial, they’d actually loveto go next door and join in. But no, “that’s disgusting – my mother said”. Youget those campaigners against pornography who condemn some video as disgustingand depraved while watching one after the other. It’s all in the name ofresearch, see. The tabloid media is full of sexual themes and pictures designedto attract readers through the genitals while condemning people in the publiceye for their sexual antics. It is the old carrot and stick technique; pull themin and then push them away. “Here is something you’d like … no, no, you can’thave it, it’s immoral.” Lionel Rubinoff wrote in The Pornography of Power:“Hypocrisy which takes the form of a denial of hypocrisy is hypocrisy squared.”4Image [../Images/00061.jpg]Figure 55: A sexual picture, but the subliminal makes this far more blatant. Canyou see it? What happens as a result of all this is that the subconscious is drawn to sexualthemes while the conscious is in denial of them and this is one major reason whyadvertising subliminals are overwhelmingly sexual. Look at the picture in Figure55. The image itself is quite overtly sexual in this case, but I wonder if youcan see how much more blatant it is on a subliminal level? Take your eyes to thewaistline of the jeans, just left of centre and follow the carefully designedshading upwards from there. See it? You could hardly miss it once it ishighlighted! Again, whenever you look at that picture from now on you will spotthe subliminal immediately because it has registered with the conscious mind.You see ads with men naked from the waist up or women naked from the back andsuch like because the mind ‘fills in’ the rest consciously or unconsciously.Such subliminal images are not rare at all. It is staggering how commonly theyare used in advertising of all kinds. The McDonald’s ad in Figure 56 is supposedto be for chicken. Maybe I have lived a sheltered life, but I’ve never seen anypart of a chicken that looks like that. I have seen dicks that look like that,but not chicken. Maybe it’s a rooster. Next time you see a can of Diet Coke (foryour sake don’t drink it!) look at the glass on the lower left. Hold the can atarms length away from you and you’ll see women’s breasts. The subconscious isattracted to the sexual theme while the conscious mind is suppressing itssexuality and, in effect, denies the sexual implants and doesn’t see them. Toconfirm the point, people accessing the subconscious during hypnosis and thosein more sexually open societies see subliminals far more easily. The findings ofVienese neurosurgeon, Otto Poetzle, in 1917 suggested that information implantedsubliminally appears in dreams and involves the same denial to hide tabooimages. The penis might appear in the dream in the form of a banana, forinstance, or, if you’re not so lucky, an asparagus. At the website of JimHagart’s Semi Subliminal World, you can find subliminals highlighted in otherCoca Cola products like Dr Pepper, Lilt and Fanta.5 They include distortedfaces, ‘gremlins’ and the usual sexual themes. By the way, the target market ofDiet Coke is overwhelmingly women and the subliminal use of women’s breasts isan example of the technique of planting subliminals of women’s sexual parts inads aimed at women and men’s in those targeting men. Being attracted to peopleof the same sex is even more taboo and the denial of the conscious mind hidesthe subliminal from view even more effectively, while attracting thesubconscious to the ad. That is why they do it. Wilson Bryan Key is one of theworld experts on subliminals and has produced a number of highly recommendedbooks on the subject. He writes:Image [../Images/00062.jpg]Figure 56: McDonald’s Chicken McDickets. Ever seen one of these on a chicken? > “In a visual percept[ion], as little as 1/1000 of the total percept[ion]> registered in the brain actually surfaces in consciousness. The remainder lies> dormant within memory. Embeds enhance perceptual experience of the picture,> intensifying responses such as EKG, EEG, GSR – heart rate, brain rhythms, and> galvanic skin response. Emotionalized, repressed information remains in the> memory system for long periods, perhaps for a lifetime. In embedded pictures,> nothing is actually hidden – certainly not by the artist. Once viewers learn> perceptual flexibility, ‘the embeds’ are readily available to consciousness.> The only thing hidden in embedded media is what viewers or listeners hide from> themselves. Repression appears to be a compulsive process, probably initiated> to protect oneself from unsettling information that would provoke anxiety.” 6 For this very reason, many are in complete denial of the existence of the globalconspiracy and its other-dimensional expression. It is just too much for them totake emotionally because of the perceived implications for their own lives. Thuspeople like me are dismissed as crazy or dangerous by many without any referenceto the endless detail and evidence available. It is the ‘shoot the messenger’syndrome when you don’t like the message. You can give these people as muchsupporting detail and evidence as you like and they will still be in denial. Ihad a guy call in to a South African radio show I was on who went intolong-winded explanations for why each element of the conspiracy was explainablewithout a conspiracy. It was not worth debating with him because no matter whatscale of evidence you presented he would have to find a way to deny theconspiracy. People support despots like Bush and Hitler because they try topersuade themselves that their leaders have the people’s best interests atheart. To face the fact that they are vicious dictators with a Nazi agenda istoo much to bear. They deny the obvious over and over until they cannot deny itanymore. By then it’s too late. This happened in Nazi Germany and is happeningin the United States and Britain today.Frontwards, backwards, upside downThe subconscious mind not only absorbs everything, it perceives what it seesfrom all angles. There is a whole area of research these days into what iscalled ‘reverse speech’. What someone is saying when their words are playedbackwards also communicates with the subconscious. It is claimed that when youplay sentences backwards you can hear what the person is really saying eventhough in forward speech they appear to be saying the opposite. I have heardsome political speeches played backwards to me and there certainly appears to betruth in this. It is the same with reversed pictures like the one highlighted inFigures 57 and 58. When the picture is the right way up it appears to be asimple, even boring, advertisement for a flooring company. Look at the picturereversed and there again you have the obvious sexual connotations. This ad waspulled from a phone book once the reverse image was noticed. Often it is themost apparently innocuous and uninspired ads that contain the most powerfulsubliminals. The more disinterested you are in the ad the more open you becometo subliminals because the conscious mind is not getting in the way of thedirect communication between subliminal and subconscious. The idea is not to getyou to remember the ad, but to plant a subliminal message like a hypnotist’scommand that can be retrieved days or weeks and months later when you arewalking around the supermarket. The subconscious programming is triggered whenpeople see the product on the shelf and they follow the command to buy it. Mostprint advertising is designed to be looked at for less than one second and theads are there for subconscious implantation, not conscious awareness.7 WilsonBryan Key says: “Ads that were recalled consciously were a loser. Anadvertisement is to motivate a decision to purchase days, weeks, or even monthsafter it has been perceived for even an instant. The job of an ad is to sell –not to be recalled.” 8 Key says minds that operate in linear reasoning (deeplyentranced by the five-sense reality) appear more susceptible to subliminals.This is still another motivation of the Illuminati to maintain the population inthe five-sense illusion. You can buy paper today implanted with subliminalmessages of your desired theme. When you send a letter or circular the personthinks they are only reading the words they can see. In truth, theirsubconscious is also absorbing the message they can’t see hidden in the paper. Aclass of eighth graders took a self-esteem test in 1983 on paper implanted withthe subliminal message, “You are loved”. They scored 15% higher for self-esteemthan those who took the test with non-subliminal paper. When the same test wasgiven to under achievers they scored 34.7% higher with the subliminal embeds.9Image [../Images/00063.jpg]Image [../Images/00064.jpg]Figure 57 and 58: This appears to be a simple, even boring advertisement, untilyou turn it upside down. The subconscious views reality from all angles and soregisters the upside down image as much as the right way up The same techniques are naturally exploited to program negative or controllingmessages. All of our senses are targeted by the subliminal manipulators.Messages are played to us just outside the frequency range that our hearing canconsciously access. These subliminal words bypass our conscious awareness andenter our minds at a subconscious level. I came across an advertisement on theInternet for subliminal tapes designed to manipulate people to have sex withyou. “Imagine … Only 5-10 minutes use required to program another person’s mindand your advances can never be rejected!”, said the ad. “Imagine … She/He thinksit’s New Age music but it’s really an Erotic Subliminal Sexual bombardment totheir subconscious mind with 1,000s of hidden messages to arouse their passionand focus it on only on you!” 10 (Do you mind finishing this chapter beforerushing to order? Thanks.)The recording industry includes subliminal audio programming in its products tomanipulate the consciousness and reality of the buyer. Dr Hal C. Becker patenteda black box in the 1960s to pipe audio subliminal messages on top of anotheraudio source. It was used in stores to plant the message “don’t steal” and theftdropped by 37%. Think how sophisticated and undetectable such technology must benow. If it can tell you subliminally not to steal, it can also tell you to buy,buy, buy; who to vote for; and what to think. Such subliminal instructions arepouring from our televisions, CDs and the media in all its forms. Even mostpeople involved with the media have no idea this is going on.“Dooo whatever weee saaaay”In the John Carpenter film, They Live, the main character finds special glassesthat allow him to see the subliminals. Without the glasses he sees normaladvertisements for Coke or holiday destinations and articles in magazines. Withthe glasses he sees the subliminal instructions “obey”, “don’t questionauthority” and “do as you are told”. This is happening around us all the time.With the glasses he also saw similar messages in ‘news’ magazines and WilsonBryan Key has indeed identified subliminals in magazines like Time. In oneexample when the US government was targeting Libya’s Colonel Gaddafi his coverpicture was embedded with the subliminal words “sex” (attraction to themagazine) and “kill” (to plant negative feelings about him).11 The anti-Gaddafipropaganda campaign was conducted by CIA Director William Casey and operationsofficer Vincent M. Cannistraro answering to Secretary of State, George Shultz,the advisor to George W’s ‘election’ campaign and a major player in Bechtel,which has benefited so handsomely from the invasion of Iraq. Time also put theword “sex” on the forehead of the Ayatollah Khomeini on the front cover onNovember 26th 1979, according to Key.12 These are the people telling you what ishappening in the world, including who was responsible for 9/11!Another piece of subliminal kit is the tachistoscope projector that flasheswords and images onto the screen for milliseconds, far too quick for theconscious mind to acknowledge. These are used in film and video production andadvertising. People connected to instruments while watching tachistoscopicsubliminals did not report a conscious awareness of any stimuli, but the alphaand theta waves in their brains were effected and so was their heart rate. Themanipulation of lighting and background sound is also used in conjunction withthe visuals. Other subliminal techniques include the double meaning or doubleentendre when a sexual or other meaning could be taken from a phrase orsituation that can have another more mundane explanation; and ‘dissonance’, whensomething is incongruous or out of proportion to the picture.Lying to ourselvesIt is not only our sexual suppression and taboos that subliminals target. Theymanipulate all human emotion, denial and defence mechanisms. Fear, as always, isthe main one: fear of death, fear of aging, fear of anything they think will beeffective. Wilson Bryan Key writes: “To avoid anxiety, overload, we constructperceptual defense mechanisms to either limit or distort our perception ofreality.” 13 Repression of our fears and feelings provides the major distortionbecause we delude ourselves into believing our own self-deception. PsychiatristR. D. Laing defines repression as when “we forget something, then we forget wehave forgotten”.14 We believe our own lies because we have forgotten we havelied in the first place. Research has revealed how emotional security,confirmation of self worth, gratifying the ego, a sense of power, sense ofroots, fear of financial hardship and fear of death or desire for immortalitycan all be influenced subliminally. This need for security and self worth ismanipulated mercilessly by advertisers and government spinners. The ‘war onterrorism’ targets almost 100% the fear of death and the desire for perceivedsafety and security for self and family. But before you can control peoplethrough such fears you have to make them fear in the first place. The 9/11attacks make them fear and you exploit that fear consciously and subconsciouslyto justify the ‘war on terrorism’. All the “terror alerts” and warnings thatspew from the White House, the Pentagon and Downing Street are designed tocontinually underpin the sense of fear that can then be exploited to advance theagenda. The more fearful and insecure you are, the more the Matrix has you. DrWilliam Sargant, a psychiatrist with the Illuminati Tavistock Institute inBritain, wrote in his 1957 book, The Battle for the Mind:> “Various types of belief can be implanted in people after brain function has> been deliberately disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear,> anger, or excitement. Of the results caused by such disturbances the most> common one is temporarily impaired judgement and heightened suggestibility.> Its various group manifestations are sometimes classed under the heading of> ‘herd instinct’, and appear most spectacularly in wartime, during severe> epidemics, and all similar periods of common danger, which increase anxiety> and so individual and mass suggestibility. > “… We would be advised not to underestimate the effect on the collective> psyche in terms of fear and a desire for the authorities to ‘protect people’> from that fear.” Some psychologists lead and direct discussions at meetings of alcoholics toencourage them to reveal their fears and desires.15 An alcoholic might saysomething about having nightmares after trying to stop drinking and theresearcher would then ask exactly what the nightmare was about and use thisinformation as subliminal images in drink advertisements. As a result you seeskulls and screaming contorted faces embedded in the ads to subliminally remindpeople what happens if you stop drinking. One Internet exposé of subliminalsclaims to have found a dozen or more screaming faces, skulls and animal faces inan ad for Seagram’s Extra Dry Gin.16 The owners of Seagrams have been theIlluminati Bronfman family in Canada who have featured in previous books. Manyimages, phrases and slogans have hidden or double meanings behind them.Symbolism can also go into this category.Image [../Images/00065.jpg]Image [../Images/00066.jpg]Figure 59 and 60: The Statue of Liberty presented to New York by FrenchFreemasons in Paris … where on an island in the River Seine you will find thestatue’s mirror image. They are holding the torch of the ‘Illuminated ones’ –the flame of Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz Symbolic subliminalsSymbolism is the language of the Illuminati because it is the language of thesubconscious and this is another major subliminal technique, as with the use ofphallic symbols of many kinds. The bloodlines and their Illuminati network areobsessed with symbolism and their symbols and codes going back thousands ofyears can clearly be found throughout American society and the rest of theworld, especially the countries of the British Empire. The ancient Illuminatisymbol of the pyramid with the capstone missing or the pyramid and all-seeingeye was placed on the dollar bill in 1933 by President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt, one of the highly significant front men for the Illuminati in theUnited States during the 20th century. The most obvious Illuminati symbol is theeternal flame or the lighted torch and this represents the ‘Illuminated ones’,the initiates illuminated into knowledge that the rest of the population isdenied. The Illuminati lighted torch is most famously held by the Statue ofLiberty. This was given to New York by French Freemasons in Paris who knew whatshe and the torch really symbolised. There is a virtual mirror image of theStatue of Liberty on an island in the River Seine in Paris (Figures 59 and 60).As the bloodlines came up into Europe and across the world they naturallybrought their symbols with them. The Statue of Liberty is the symbolic image ofthe goddess worshipped by the Illuminati bloodlines since they were based inBabylon (and before). She goes under many names, including Queen Semiramis, the“branch bearer”, who was symbolised as a dove. If you look at Figure 61, you cansee the image of Queen Semiramis on an ancient coin and compare that with herrepresentation as the Statue of Liberty. When the Illuminati bloodlines movedtheir headquarters to Rome, the goddess was worshipped as Venus Columba or“Venus the Dove”. The French word for dove is still colombe. This is why a manwho signed his name “Colon” is known to official history as “Columbus”. He wasbearing the branch of the dove into the Americas in 1492 and was given thissymbolic name relating to the Illuminati goddess. We have the centre of USgovernment located in Washington DC – the District of Columbia, or the dove,Semiramis. We have British Columbia in Canada, Columbia Broadcasting (CBS),Columbia University, and Columbia Pictures with the symbol of the woman and thelighted torch – the symbol of Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz in Babylon.Image [../Images/00067.jpg]Figure 61: Both “Libertys” are symbolic representations of Queen Semiramis, theBabylonian Illuminati goddess The Illuminati use what I call reverse symbolism. They place their symbols allaround us, but present them with the reverse of their true meaning. The dovesymbolises peace to most people, while to the Illuminati bloodlines itrepresents their goddess, Queen Semiramis. The lighted torch means freedom andliberty to the population, but to the Illuminati it is the very symbol of theiragenda and control. The Nazis reversed the ancient symbol of the swastika tosymbolise the negative and Satanists have reversed the pentagram or five-pointedstar to point downwards for the same reason. Everything is symbolism and ritualto the Illuminati, and always has been. After they killed President Kennedy inDallas in 1963, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry placed an obelisk in DealeyPlaza with a lighted torch at the top. When they buried Kennedy at ArlingtonCemetery in Washington DC they placed a lighted torch, the Illuminati eternalflame, on his grave. The spot where people leave their tributes to the murderedPrincess Diana in Paris is a massive representation of the flame held by theStatue of Liberty. It is located on top of the Pont de L’Alma Tunnel where theIlluminati arranged for her to die in 1997 (see The Biggest Secret for thebackground to Diana’s murder and the ‘Goddess Diana’ symbolism involved). Thename Capitol Hill is also Illuminati symbolism and named after Capitoline Hill,a sacred place for the Illuminati outside Rome during the Roman Empire. The morethat I understand about the manipulation of the subconscious, the more theIlluminati obsession with symbolism takes on an even greater significance. TheseIlluminati symbols speak to the subconscious and implant messages relating tocontrol and “we’re watching you” while the conscious mind is oblivious of whatis going on beyond its perception. The Illuminati use of code words and phrasesare designed to have the same effect.Santa pauseThey also use Satanic ritual subliminals and you find them in the mostunexpected places. Stewart Swerdlow confirms what I have been saying in my booksfor years – “the Illuminati love symbolism, dates, name derivatives and doublemeanings that cryptically tell the truth while hiding it from the generalpopulation”.17 He says that the ‘Santa Claus’ story is an example of this. Themyth of Father Christmas or St Nicholas is an old Pagan tale and he was depictedwearing green. It was Coca Cola who gave him a red suit in a massive advertisingcampaign and he became known as Santa – an anagram of Satan. Swerdlow writes:> “Satanism and Satanic rituals have grown exponentially since the media blitz> of the Red Santa. This subliminal method instils in the mind-pattern that a> mystical, non human can enter people’s homes. He will be good to them only if> they behave in a certain way during the year. The red costume speaks for> itself – red is the color code for entry into the astral planes. Red is the> color code used by the Goddess during Reptilian ritual to invoke astral> entities. > “Of course, Santa lives at the North Pole, which is an entry point into the> inner-Earth, and the underground Reptilian society. He has short little elves> that do his work, symbolic of the small greys with a group mind pattern. The> flying reindeer and sled symbolise the interdimensional flying craft used to> enter there. Children are advised to leave Santa a snack for his arrival,> representing a sacrificial offering to a powerful god. In addition, the> commercialism surrounding this artificial Christmas holiday is designed to> extract any religious intentions as well as enrich an already wealthy global> elite.” 18 All the major symbols of ‘Christmas’, including the tree, holly and mistletoe,come from Pagan festivals. Swerdlow also highlights the enormous number oftelevision programmes for children that present reptilians as their friends andhe says that the baby in the centre of the Sun, as depicted in the Tellytubbiesseries for small children, is a Reptilian religious symbol. “The baby at thecenter of the Sun indicates that this baby is a sacrifice to the Sun God.” 19Selling the presidentAll the subliminal techniques used by advertisers to sell products are used bythe government spinners who are, after all, just selling a president, primeminister or policy in the same way that Coca Cola sells canned drinks. One ofthe more crass and incompetent attempts at subliminal manipulation came in theBush presidential campaign in 2000 when a political ad placed by the RepublicanNational Committee flashed the word ‘RATS’ over a Gore prescription drugproposal (Figure 62). It was left up too long in the same way that a subliminalflash of President François Mitterrand was spotted in the opening titles of aFrench news programme when he was seeking election. The Bush ‘RATS’ tape onlyhad to be slowed down slightly to be clearly visible. Let no one kid themselvesthat subliminal messages (or “subliminable” as George Bush called them) are notpouring from political advertisements. Note how the background behind Bush isalways full of pictures of his family when he is announcing the certain death offamilies in countries his masters want to conquer. It is all aimed at thesubconscious. Operation Iraqi Freedom, the title the Pentagon spinners gave totheir human slaughter in Iraq, was devised for the same reason. The names forthese military invasions are designed solely to depict what the spinners wantthe public to believe the war is all about. Any news organisation worthassociating with the name journalism, would acknowledge the title OperationIraqi Freedom once when it was first announced and then never mention it again.To do so is to knowingly allow you and your viewers to be manipulated. Instead,when I was in America during the war, I saw ‘news networks’, like CNN andMurdoch’s Fox News, displaying “Operation Iraqi Freedom” on the bottom of thescreen for much of the time. That was speaking constantly to the subconsciouswhile the conscious mind was watching the pictures on the rest of the screen. Itwas a disgrace, but then most of those that control such organisations areintellectual prostitutes anyway, so what do they care? And I’m not sure aboutthe intellectual bit.Image [../Images/00068.jpg]Figure 62: Gotcha! The subliminal implant of ‘RATS’ in a Bush commercialattacking Al Gore in the 2000 election campaign. It was not subliminal enoughand could be seen by slightly slowing down the tape Speaking with forked tongueThe manipulation and suppression of language is crucial to the mind programmingof the people and the conditioning of reality. Words are the method ofcommunication in the five-sense realm and they are targeted big time by thespinners. The connection between the manipulation of words and the manipulationof thought and perception is fundamental. This can be seen in the techniquecalled Neuro Linguistic Programming or NLP in which political leaders andspeechwriters, lawyers, salespeople, etc., are trained. I have seen NLPdescribed as “software for your brain” because it allows you to “automaticallytap into the kind of experiences you want to have”.20 Maybe, but like allknowledge, it can be used another way to tap into the kind of experiences youwant others to think they are having. Does anyone believe that politicians,lawyers and salespeople learn the techniques of NLP primarily for personalgrowth or because they wish to manipulate the population, judges and juries orpotential customers? NLP was developed in the 1970s from the techniques ofpeople like Dr Milton Erickson of the Milton Erickson Foundation in Phoenix,Arizona, and the founder of “Ericksonian Hypnosis”. This involves communicating“with the whole person by utilizing conscious and unconscious levels” andteaches “how to utilize and bypass client resistance by embedding therapeuticinterventions in seemingly casual conversation”.21 Bypass client resistance? Cutthe Orwellian language and it means mind manipulation, tapping into theunconscious mind without the person’s conscious knowledge to plant the thoughtsyou wish them to follow. NLP claims to train students to read others by notingtheir eye position and choice of language and so on.22 With the manipulative useof NLP the idea is to put your target into a trance state without them realisingit, just as a skilled hypnotist can do. Dick Sutphen, an expert in subliminalprogramming, said that if a suggestion or command is given in this state, “… thesuggestions are not challenged by your conscious mind, they are accepted by yoursubconscious, which begins to create the circumstance necessary to change yourlife so it will match your new beliefs”.23 Or creates the circumstance necessaryto change the beliefs of someone else. This trance state is vital to mindprogramming because the conscious mind stands aside to allow the subconscious tobe accessed, for thoughts to be planted. The trance state is, appropriately,connected to the most ancient part of the human brain, the R-complex orreptilian brain.NewspeakThe use of language for mind-control was highlighted most famously by GeorgeOrwell in his classic, 1984, which was written in 1948 and published thefollowing year. Orwell (real name, Eric Blair) was heavily involved in Britishpolitical life and it was not purely from imagination that he could foretell soaccurately the Big Brother society we are experiencing. He could see it coming.Orwell used the term, ‘Newspeak’, for the language of manipulation andsuppression. In Orwell’s novel, the state controlled media use Newspeak andother linguistic trickery to spread its propaganda and brainwash the public.Orwell explains in his essay Politics and the English Language, how “Politicallanguage … is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, andto give an appearance of solidity to pure wind”.24 Or, as he puts in 1984: “Waris peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” 25In the society predicted by Orwell, the names for government ministries werechosen to present the opposite meaning to their true function. The Ministry ofTruth was there to falsify records; the Ministry of Peace was the one thatorchestrated the wars; the Ministry of Love was “the really frightening one”that questioned and tortured suspects; and the Ministry of Plenty produced fakefigures to convince the people the economy was doing well when there were majorshortages because of the endless wars being fought. The forced labour camp wasnamed the Joycamp. This is what we have today. Ministries of information arethere to spread disinformation; ministries of defence launch wars of conquest;departments of homeland security are there to secure control; “Operation IraqiFreedom” was designed to hide the truth that it was really Operation IraqiSlaughter and Conquest; the term ‘democracy’ is used as a cover fordictatorship. Orwell’s manipulators, like those manipulating our minds today,repeated the same statements over and over in the knowledge that in doing so itwould indoctrinate the people to believe them through sheer repetition. Themantra about ‘weapons of mass destruction’ was a most obvious example as thepublic were prepared to accept the invasion of Iraq. Puppets like Bush, Blairand Powell knew precisely what they were doing as they bashed out the samephrase hour after hour. Watch for the repeated messages and you’ll see what youare being prepared to accept next. Orwell’s Ministry of Truth changed news itemsand documents that cast the authorities in a bad light. Once the originaldocument was replaced it was destroyed. Orwell writes:> “This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but> to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets ... Day by day and almost> minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction> made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct;> nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with> the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record.” 26 This is what happens when the present Fourth Reich finds ‘documents’ thatsupport their claims and others that “expose” those who challenge them.Hiding realityA major aim of Newspeak is to use words to underplay the horrors and injusticesinflicted by the manipulators and to emphasise their ‘victories’. Orwell givesan example of how the policy of bombing defenceless villages from the air andforcing people from their homes is called “pacification” and millions ofpeasants robbed of their farms with no more than they can carry is called“transfer of population or rectification of frontiers”.27 In modern wars, likethe invasion of Iraq, we hear the constant repetition of the term “mopping upoperations”. This disguises the reality behind “mopping up” – killing anyonestill resisting the tyranny after the main battle is over. There is also theobscene term “collateral damage”, which is Newspeak for slaughtering civiliansin the name of freeing them. “Pre-emptive strikes” is Newspeak for mass murderand conquest by attacking first. The US Justice (Injustice) Department produceda law within the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 to allow thegovernment to strip American citizenship from anyone giving “material support”to any group designated as terrorists. The [In]Justice Department naturallydecides who are considered terrorists. But how can they take away someone’s UScitizenship when this is specifically forbidden by the Constitution? ByNewspeak. “Material support” for terrorists is a Newspeak phrase that means “anysupport we decide is support” and section 501 of the act says that Americans canvoluntarily give up their rights to citizenship purely by their behaviour. Toquote the Newspeak: “… an intent to relinquish nationality need not bemanifested in words, but can be inferred from conduct”. If you, in the opinionof the [In]Justice Department, give “material support” to terrorists (thedesignation of which they decide) you are voluntarily giving up your rights tocitizenship. Once that is done your constitutional rights are ended. First theypass ‘anti-terrorist’ laws to do what they like with foreigners they dubterrorists or supporters of terrorism, as with those held without charge, trial,or lawyers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and then they use this all-embracingNewspeak clause to take away the citizenship of those Americans they aretargeting so they can hold them indefinitely without charge, trial or access toa lawyer. Another common Newspeak phrase to justify grotesque inequality ofwealth distribution is: “We don’t believe in punishing people because they aresuccessful.” You hear Tony Blair say this a lot. This moves the emphasise of the“victim” of injustice from those working their butts off to make it throughanother week to those making a fortune exploiting those working their butts offto make it through another week. When George Bush announced tax cuts thatbenefited people like teachers and firefighters by $350 to $500 a year andmulti-millionaires by $88,000, the White House spokesman and master ofmendacity, Ari Fleischer, said those very words: “The president does not believein punishing people because they are successful.” 28Big brother speaksHere are a few of Orwell’s Newspeak terms coined in 1948 that are so relevant towhat is happening today.> Crimethink: to even consider that the authorities could be wrong in any way. > Crimestop: to instinctively change your thought processes whenever you are in> danger of breaking the law of crimethink and never listening to views that> expose the ruling cabal. This has been described as “protective stupidity”. > Thinkpol: the Thought Police who’s role is to eliminate crimethink through> spying, surveillance cameras, etc. > Blackwhite: to accept whatever the authorities say without question and, as> Orwell, put it: “… loyal willingness to say black is white when party> [government] discipline demands this. It also means the ability to believe> that black is white, and more, to know black is white, and forget that one has> ever believed the contrary”. > Duckspeak: to speak without thinking, as in quacking like a duck. > Facecrime: to show any facial expression that Big Brother surveillance could> interpret as having something to hide. This could be a look of anxiety or> failing to react to official statements or alleged “victories” in the correct> manner, including not cheering when a war was won. > Doublethink: the refusal or inability to see contradictions and to have two> contradictory beliefs in your mind at the same time while believing them both> to be true. This comment by boy George Bush is an example: “See, we love – we> love freedom. That’s what they didn’t understand. They hate things; we love> things. They act out of hatred; we don’t seek revenge, we seek justice out of> love.” This asks us to believe that love = mass murder of civilians. This is anapparently impossible contradiction or doublethink, but tens of millions ofAmericans and others believe that both are true. Doublethink, and thereforecrimestop (refusing to think anything ill of the government) are essential totyrannies because their whole foundation is based on contradictions and lies.The character called Winston in Orwell’s 1984 defined doublethink or doublespeakas:> “To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while> telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which> cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them,> to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to> believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party [government] was the> guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to> draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then> promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the> process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce> unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of> hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word ‘doublethink’> involved the use of doublethink.” 29 Newspeak todayThe Orwellian society is now all around us, gathering pace by the hour, andnaturally a vital component of the Illuminati thought control today is, asOrwell envisaged, the manipulation of language. Here are some of the realmeanings behind modern Newspeak that the spinners constantly work to camouflage.> American interest: the interest of those who control the United States and> anyone who resists that control is acting “against American interests”. > National security: the security of the authorities to hide their agenda and> the control of the people through increased security to meet manufactured> dangers. > World community: you hear this mantra pour from the mouths of the globalists> like Bush, Powell and Blair. It implies that ‘free’ nations are bound together> in pursuit of freedom, peace and morality as a “world community” when, as we> saw with Iraq, this is Newspeak for American and British tyranny on behalf of> the Illuminati. “World community” is also designed to prepare the way for the> acceptance of the world government. > Anti-government groups: any organisation that seeks to highlight and challenge> government dictatorship. They are, therefore, dubbed highly dangerous> anarchists or potential terrorists. > Extremist: anyone saying anything different to the government-supported norm> (see also “militant”). Redistributing wealth from mega rich to starving poor> is considered “extremism” by those in power. > Conspiracy theory: any claim that the government is lying and following an> agenda hidden from the people. > Change: a big Newspeak word that means to introduce the Illuminati global> society by creating problems and undermining the status quo to bring about the> perceived need for “change”. The word “reform” is used in the same way, not> least by Tony Blair, who claims that people are either “reformers” (those who> accept change in line with the agenda) or “wreckers” (those that resist such> change). > Right and Left /Conservative and Liberal: terms designed to present every> issue as black and white polarities and obscure the fact that there are more> than two sides to every debate. > Nation building: after bombing and invading a target country you place a> puppet government in power to represent your interests while claiming it is a> government chosen by the native people. This ensures the country is run by> your dictat, but without your overt control. We don’t want people to realise> that a campaign of global conquest is happening before their eyes (or visual> cortex). > Peacekeeping: occupation of a country by foreign troops. > Peace process: giving the impression that you are working for peace when it is> merely an interlude before launching more conquest through war. > Terrorist: those who protest through violence, but also anyone who attacks or> challenges the interests of the ‘West’, especially America, Britain and> Israel, or stands in the way of further conquest. > Liberation: mass murder and terrorism against civilians in the name of> stopping terrorism that is nothing whatsoever to do with the people you kill> or maim for life. > War on terrorism: the constant repeat of this process. > Attack: when America and Co are the target. > Retaliation: when America and Co attack. > First-strike: when America and Co attack first in retaliation for what America> and Co claims their target country could do to them (see also lies). > Self-defence: killing the other guy before he even thinks of killing you. > Western values: these are values you want to impose on others, but don’t have> yourself. Mythical belief in the ‘West’ as the good guys appearing over the> ridge to kill them baddy Indians. See also John Wayne. > Campaign contribution: bribe. > Affirmative action: racial discrimination that affirmative action is supposed> to eliminate. The only way to do achieve racial equality is for everyone to be> chosen on their merits irrespective of their colour, creed or background (see> fairness, and justice) and for everyone to have an equal opportunity to> develop their talents. > Education: brainwashing. > Tidying up exercise: the phrase you use when you want to make major changes> while disguising them as insignificant. This was used to lie to the British> people about changes to the constitution of the European Union that pretty> much remove what is left of British sovereignty. It was only a “tidying up> exercise” to “streamline” existing legislation and make the EU more> “democratic”. Classic Newspeak. > Good citizens: slaves that do not protest at being so or even realise that> they are. > Equality: make everyone a slave. > Democracy: elected, or even unelected, dictatorship in which the majority> often vote for the losers. See also tyranny of the uninformed majority. > Crime: breaking a law passed without our agreement no matter how ludicrous it> may be. > Freedom of the press: freedom to report the official version of events. > Human rights: the right to do what the government tells you. > Tolerance: do not criticise or challenge the behaviour of anything and anyone,> no matter what the circumstances. > Zero-tolerance: tyranny. > Free trade: using slave labour to make your products in the world’s poorest> countries for a few cents and exporting them without tariff charges to the> richest countries to sell for top-of-the-range prices. Also means to dump your> products in any country you wish and destroy the local economy and livelihoods> of the world’s poorest people. > Competition: transnational corporations competing to see which can exploit the> global population most effectively. > Capitalism: cartelism. > Isolationist: anyone who does not want to dictate to others and control the> people of other nations. > Level playing field: fixing the system in favour of those you wish to win. > Propaganda: whatever your opponents say because you only tell the truth. > Freedom: slavery. The distorted use of these words and others is designed to plant a false realityinto the conscious, and, especially, subconscious mind. This manipulates peoplesto see themselves and the world in a way that suits the ambitions of theirleaders.‘Hate crime’ = thought crimeOne of the most powerful expressions of the Orwellian thought police is theso-called hate crime. In Canada they have a ‘Hate Crimes Unit’ and there areother versions of this around the world like the Commission for Racial Equalityin Britain that is dominated by people with their own agendas to pursue. Suchorganisations are in daily search of those who are expressing a view that theThought Police deem is inciting racial hatred. You can even be charged with a“hate crime” for revealing true information that the Thought Police decide could“create an atmosphere” in which racial attacks or “crimes” could take place. Tosuggest that the official story of what happened to Jewish people in NaziGermany is not 100% correct is to be branded a “hatemonger” and a “racist” byreflex action. No further debate is necessary for the psychological fascists;you are an “historical revisionist” (Newspeak for “racist” because you challengethe official version of history) and you must be castigated and condemned topublic vilification. George W. Bush called those who questioned his lies aboutIraq as “historical revisionists” in the hope that the tainting of that termwould undermine his gathering critics. But strangely, if anyone says that thehorrors of the Pol Pot genocide in Cambodia were exaggerated or that the Irishdid not suffer as much as they claim from British rule and the potato famine,this is not considered racist or a sign of hatred against Cambodians or theIrish. So isn’t that racist to condemn one opinion of history and not the other?Why should Cambodians or the Irish suffer such discrimination by the Hate CrimesUnit? Surely that makes the Hate Crimes Unit guilty of a hate crime? Arrestthem, I say. Jewish people can state they would never drink from a bottle ofwine that had not been opened by a Jew and that’s fine, no problem. But a whiteperson who says he would not drink from a bottle of wine that had not beenopened by a white person is called a racist. Personally I don’t care either way,just get me a glass. The ‘Jewish’ press can talk of the “plague of Jewish-Arabmarriages” without any consequences (and nor should there be, however repugnantthe comment might be). But if the Arab press talked of the “plague ofArab-Jewish marriages” they would be branded anti-Semitic.30Jewish people can say they are the race chosen by God and above all other races,but when a white person says that his is the master race he is branded a racistand a “white supremacist”. There are no chosen people or master races, white,Jewish, or blue with pink spots. There is only one consciousness. The body is ahologram, an illusion, so all claims to racial superiority or inferiority arethe work of the mind-dead and the same goes for those so obsessed with race thatthey look for racism everywhere. The point I am making, however, is that theOrwellian concept of the ‘hate crime’ is extremely arbitrary (though give ittime) and basically depends on the power wielded by those controlling thepolicies of the hate crimes authorities.‘Hate crime’ legislation is not about protecting minorities from discrimination,that’s the movie. The real reason for ‘hate crime’ laws is to stop legitimatedebate and the free-flow of information and opinions that do not suit themanipulators.Once you start making a person’s thoughts and opinions a crime to express youare living in a totalitarian state. It is not racial hatred to suggest thatofficial history is not correct, just as it is not racist against Americans tosay that the official story of 9/11 is a lie from start to finish. This nonsenseis exploited to stop proper investigation into people and events and has nothingto do with stopping racial hatred. But this is the way Newspeak works; it isdesigned to manipulate the landscape of language and frighten people intokeeping quiet for fear of being dubbed a racist and hatemonger, with theconsequences all that entails, in the hatred directed at you. I have experiencedthis after being targeted some years ago by purveyors of hatred masquerading as‘anti-racists’ and yet there is not a racist cell in my body. The whole conceptof racism from my philosophy is silly. How can anyone be racist about ahologram? Ironically it is those who cry “racist” most often who are the biggestracists and merchants of hate. They are obsessed with it. Israeli writer, IsraelShamir, highlighted this with regard to those who shout “anti-Semite” ateverything that moves:> “Elie Wiesel is still very much with us. In his book, Legends of Our Time,> this Jewish writer wrote: ‘Every Jew, somewhere in his being, should set apart> a zone of hate – healthy, virile hate – for what the German personifies and> for what persists in the German’. Not ‘the Nazi’, but ‘the German’. For this> sermon of hate he received the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize from the Norwegian> Academy, in company with the Cambodia-destroyer Henry Kissinger and the> Kana-murderer, Shimon Peres. Armed with this recognition of the Norwegians,> Elie Wiesel called (at Christmas Eve!): ‘War [with Iraq] is the only option’.> If you need to feel guilt, feel guilt for this Nobel Peace Prize. > “This vast difference in the feelings of Norwegians towards their national> genius Hamsun and towards Elie Wiesel, the schmaltzy hate-monger, leads us to> a conclusion: in prevailing post-WWII mainstream discourse, the taboo on> criticism of Jews has caused strong bias and undermined the humanist idea of> the Equality of Man. Pre-war anti-Semitism has been superseded by another> extreme, philo-Semitism, a belief that Jews can do no wrong and should never> be referred to except in the most complimentary terms. This equally racist> attitude has created severe misbalance in politics and discourse. It has to be> corrected in order to save our planet and mankind from the triumphant> ‘Semitism’ of their definition.” 31 How can it be “anti-Semitic” to highlight the number of people loyal to Israelwho are behind the wars of American conquest in the Middle and Near East thattransform the Arab lands in line with Israel’s desires? Or to state how manypeople loyal to Israel control the media and the flow of information? Would itbe racist to point this out if the architects of the Bush policies weredominated by Arabs and American troops invaded Israel? If highlighting bias isgoing to be denounced as racist, we might as well all walk away and let theworld burn. Yet when British politician, Tam Dalyell, notes the obvious conflictof interest between the number of Israel-supporters in the Bush government andtheir policies favourable to Israel, he is dubbed an “anti-Semite”. If you aretalking about racial inequality, where does it lie in this case? Canadian writerHenry Makow, whose grandparents were victims of the Nazis, condemned theappalling treatment by the American and Canadian authorities of Ernst Zundel,who was dubbed a “hate criminal” for questioning the official story of theHolocaust. Civilised societies treat all people the same no matter what theircolour, creed, background or opinion. Tyrannies do not, and that means Canadaand the United States are tyrannies. Makow wrote:> “Zundel’s claims are repugnant, but he has a right to be wrong. Society needs> people to dispute the historical record. One may be right. If spreading false> information is a crime, shouldn’t we also lock up [US news anchor man] Tom> Brokaw? Canada has locked up Ernst Zundel. According to his wife, he is being> mistreated in prison. He risks deportation as a ‘security risk’. Bernie Farber> of the Canadian Jewish Congress concedes Zundel doesn’t ‘actually wield the> stick’ but ‘provides oxygen’ to extremists. That definition would curb> everyone’s freedom of speech. > “When questioning the truth becomes ‘hate’, we have entered Orwell’s ‘1984’> era of thought crime. Don’t kid yourself. This is the slippery slope to> tyranny and Jewish organizations are partly to blame. We must stand up in> defiance. The charge of hate is used selectively to disarm legitimate> opposition. The definition of ‘hatred’ is very selective. For example,> lesbians spew hatred of men but they are never arrested. Feminists teach> impressionable girls that all males are potentially violent sexual predators.> That’s OK.

But it is not a crime. In these questions, only> the truth matters. Let the truth speak for itself. Let Zundel be judged by> it.” 32 This is a vital point if we wish to live in freedom. Either we have freedom ofexpression or we don’t. You can’t be a little bit free. You either are or youaren’t. If you want the freedom to say what you want then you must give the samefreedom to all others and defend that right when it is challenged, even if youdon’t agree with them. Freedom of expression does not exist unless it applies toall. People in Nazi Germany did not have the freedom to speak out and warn thepopulation about the real agenda of the fascists. Look again at what the NaziPropaganda Minister, Dr Joseph M. Goebbels, said:> “The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the> people from the political, economic, and/or military consequences of the lie.> It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to> repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by> extension, the truth becomes the greatest enemy of the State.” All dictatorships want to curb this basic right to express your thoughts andopinions, but ‘anti-racist’ organisations and people who have targeted me, likeBernie Farber of the Canadian Jewish Congress and a Canadian lawyer calledRichard Warman, at the amazingly titled Canadian Human Rights Commission, wantto decide who has free speech and who does not. Their like can be found acrossthe world, but the moment their right of expression is challenged they are thefirst to squeal. Actress Brigitte Bardot was threatened with legal action forattacking Islam, homosexuals, the unemployed, teachers and illegal immigrants,and calling for a return of the guillotine. She made the comments in her book,Un Cri Dans Le Silence. She said gays were fairground freaks, teachers arrive atwork with greasy hair wearing disgusting jeans and muddy trainers, and that ‘theprofessional unemployed’ don’t even want to work illegally. We may find herviews either appalling and laughable, but they are her views and she has a rightto them. What she does not have a right to do unchallenged is force her views onothers or seek to introduce discrimination on the basis of her views. But wouldyou rather live in a world in which she could express her thoughts, unpleasantas they may be, or one in which the Thought Police dictated to her – andtherefore you – what you could and could not say? Her freedom of speech isactually yours. If everyone is not free then no one is. Israel Shamir makes thepoint very well:> “Millennia before the Great Cultural Revolution, the Chinese knew the secret> of harmony: the non-Manichean balance of opposing ideas, the principles of> Ying and Yang. Properly balanced, Jewish ideas can be beneficial:> anti-Christian zeal would limit Church excesses, just as materialism and> egoism can keep the feet of Man on the ground while his head is in heaven,> feminism can balance male chauvinism, and the sex obsession of Freud can> balance the asceticism of spiritualists. Balanced, even Zionism will shrink to> the humane proportions of Jewish love for Palestine. But balanced it should> be.”33 Crackpot correctnessThe reign of terror called ‘political correctness’ (PC) is Orwellian thoughtcontrol or crimethink. I have yet to work out who decides what is ‘political’and what is ‘correct’, but it certainly has nothing to do with anyone I know.Let us just think, or crimethink, about this for a moment. We are allowing someunknown ‘authority’ to dictate what we can and cannot say with our own freewill.What?? The vehicles for its imposition are the robot radicals with their heartson their sleeves and their brains in the place where the Sun don’t shine. Theybelieve that we must remove any words, phrases or opinions that might upsetanyone. Unless, of course, you are a target of these people for your allegedlypolitically incorrect words, phrases or opinions, in which case they seem tohave no problem with hurling the very abuse in your direction that they wouldcondemn if it was issued from the mouths of anyone else. The ‘PCs’, or Purveyorsof Claptrap, are yet another Orwellian tyranny.In an article headed “Politically-Correct Censorship Rampant in US Schools”, theAustralian Sunday Times reported the insane results of 25 years of politicalcorrectness. The article focussed on a book by Diane Ravitch, a former Americangovernment official, called The Language Police: How Pressure Groups RestrictWhat Students Learn.34 A reviewer in the Chicago Sun-Times said the book wouldcause readers to gnash their teeth as they read of the outrages against commonsense.35 Ravitch says: “Some of this censorship is trivial, some is ludicrousand some is breathtaking in its power to dumb down what children learn inschool.”36 She reveals that a story entitled The Friendly Dolphin was rejectedby one school committee because it discriminated against students who did notlive near the sea. A story called The Silly Old Lady was rejected because itcontained a “negative stereotype” of an elderly woman who put too many gadgetson her bicycle. Another entitled A Perfect Day for Ice-Cream had to be rewrittenwithout reference to ice-cream because of a ban in California on any mention ofjunk food. Other concepts banned by the Thought Police included disobedientchildren, ghosts, parents who quarrel, ski trips and birthday parties. In someschools, dinosaurs cannot be mentioned because they imply a theory of evolutionthat not all Americans agree with. Such lunacy was being routinely introducedacross America, Ravitch said, and the same is happening in Britain andelsewhere. These decisions are being made by the Orwellian “bias and security”panels that advise state education boards what children should read. Ravitchsays that these panels operate “an increasingly bizarre policy of censorship”that has been “stripping away everything that is potentially thought-provokingand colourful from the texts children are to encounter.”37 Note that: strippingaway anything that is “potentially thought provoking”. That is the idea and theagenda behind political correctness, as it was in Orwell’s Big Brother society.The Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook by Henry Beard andChristopher Cerf 38 shows how far down the road we have travelled. A personconfined to a wheelchair is called “differently abled”; a person without a jobis “unwaged” (the constant use of the prefix ‘un’ was part of Orwell’s Newspeakin 1984, as in “ungood”); to be disabled is now to be “physically challenged”;your partner is your “significant other” to avoid the “sexual stereotyping” ofboyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife; if you are shorter than average you are“vertically challenged”; George Bush is not stupid, he’s “mentally challenged”;a waiter or waitress becomes a waitron; women are wimyn or wimmin to avoid“man”. Mailman should be personperson then and manhole needs to be personhole?Then you have ableism, ageism, lookism, sizeism, weightism; all of them straightfrom the Orwell dictionary. Political correctness now includes avoiding sportsat school that involve anyone winning or losing. It might upset them, see. Butwhy then don’t they ban all exams to avoid winners and losers in academia? Oh,it’s OK to win if you excel in the classroom, but not if your gift is on thesports field. And that’s the point. These mind-fascists say they want tocelebrate the diversity of people and then spend all their time destroying it,not least the diversity of the language. Yet more doublethink.When opinions or descriptions deemed unacceptable to these zealots are erasedfrom use, it forces people into a land of sameness, mediocrity and the inabilityto communicate what they really think and feel. The zealots decide what is rightand wrong, acceptable and incorrect. They are mind-police, nothing less, and theultimate racists, ageists, ableists, lookists, sizeists, weightists andchauvinists because they are more obsessed with identifying such people thananyone else on the planet. I see an old lady and they see a potential victim ofdiscrimination on the grounds of age. I see a woman and they see a potentialvictim of discrimination on the grounds of her sex. It is now politicallyincorrect to say that someone is “crippled”. Why? What are we supposed to do,encourage them to be Olympic champion for the one hundred metres? They will haveother skills and abilities that an Olympic champion will not have. So celebratethose advantages instead of being obsessed with the disadvantages. I have aright hand mangled by arthritis that I cannot use except for one finger to type.I am basically disabled in the right hand and not so good in the left, either.So what am I then? Differently abled? No, call me crippled if you want, I don’tgive a damn. It does not matter unless it matters to me.Surely what we should be doing is encouraging people to see that how othersdescribe them doesn’t matter; to free them from being effected by labels,whatever they are. When we impose rigid descriptions we emphasise thedifferences by developing a ‘special’ term for those that want to be treatedlike everyone else. You can’t call people mentally handicapped any longer; theyare “people with learning difficulties”. But why do they have learningdifficulties? Because they have a mental handicap. What have I got with thephysical handicap in my hands then, digit turning difficulties? I worked closelywith the mentally handicapped for years and they are incredible people withabilities, not least in the way they can express love, that are a wonder tobehold. What an insult to them to say that they must be called by somemanufactured phrase because they might be upset or suffer discrimination.They’re bigger than that, even if the thought-censors aren’t. People havedifferent abilities, bodies and challenges. That’s what makes for the gloriousdiversity of life. Why do these agents of discrimination want to hide that whenit should be a source of celebration? I can’t catch footballs any longer like Idid when I was a goalkeeper because it’s too painful. But I still intend to takeManchester United and the Miami Dolphins to court for the blatant discriminationof not playing me in their first team just because I have a crippled hand. Oneof the most insane examples of political correctness came in my home town ofLeicester when police raided a woman’s house and took away her collection ofchina pigs after complaints from local Muslims. They said that the display ofmodel pigs were “racially offensive” to them.39 Not as offensive as their idiocyis to me, mind. We should be tackling real discrimination on the grounds ofhandicap, race, or sex, not inventing a new industry of nonsensical Newspeak andpolitical correctness that insults the intelligence of all involved. But, then,from the Illuminati’s point of view, it is not crazy at all.Method in the madnessWe should not be kidded by the ridiculous words and terms spawned by the censorsof political correction. Yes, it appears so breathtakingly dumb and many of itsignorant practitioners are. But behind that is a coldly calculated plan that hasbeen long in the making. In 1984, Orwell’s Newspeak changed the language toremove the words that described political ideas at odds with the officialposition and a major aim was to reduce the number of words available to people.This is the true reason for political correctness and the gathering lack ofemphasis on expanding the vocabulary of children and students. Orwell knew thatas you reduce the number of words available, you contract correspondingly theability to express your thoughts as words. To suppress words is to suppressthought, or, as Orwell said: “… if thought corrupts language, language can alsocorrupt thought”. Listen to politicians and the military in their publicstatements. They use glib phrases that lack the clear meaning that a biggervocabulary of words would offer. They don’t want to be specific, that’s theidea, and incomprehensible Newspeak jargon is used for the same reason. Thefurther you reduce the words (and through the generations even the awareness ofthem) the more bland communication becomes and the desire to write and readbooks will diminish. Blandness is what the manipulators are looking for and anywords that make a clear statement are targeted. Wilson Bryan Key writes in TheAge of Manipulation about his experience of writing a speech with others for USPresident Dwight Eisenhower:> “For thirty-six sleepless hours, three writers turned out draft after draft,> reviewed by a White House deputy press secretary who offered terse comments> like, ‘Much too specific!’ ‘Ease up on factual references!’ and ‘Take it back> and fuzz it up!’ ‘Fuzz it up,’ we discovered eventually, meant avoid all> clear, factual statements about anything more specific than the time of day …> The speech was endlessly discussed for likely audience reactions, belief and> attitude reinforcements, and implied meanings … Would anyone take the empty> rhetoric seriously? The speech read smoothly, but said absolutely nothing> about anything. This was precisely what it was intended to say. During> audience interviews after the oration, most expressed satisfaction with the> great man’s words. ‘Ike really gave it to them!’ ‘He has my vote!’ ‘I like the> way he thinks!’ Great speech!’” 40 The manipulators want to reduce the words available to express a thought and,through this, influence what and how people think. When the words to express athought have gone, so has the thought because in this reality we think in words.The same happens to memory which cannot be consciously retained without thewords to express it. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines Newspeak as: “noun,usage: often capitalized; propagandistic language marked by euphemism,circumlocution, and the inversion of customary meanings. Etymology: Newspeak, alanguage ‘designed to diminish the range of thought,’ in the novel 1984 (1949)by George Orwell.” There you have the key motivation of Newspeak: “… to diminishthe range of thought”. A Newspeak engineer in 1984 says they are cuttingNewspeak to the bone and every year there will be fewer words to use. “In theend we shall make thought crime literally impossible because there will be nowords in which to express it.” To do this, the Orwellian controllers targetedwhat they called “Oldspeak”, the language that had developed over thousands ofyears, and also “Oldthink”, those ideas and attitudes resistant to the ‘change’and ‘reform’ demanded by those in power. When Donald Rumsfeld described theresistance by Germany and France to the Iraq war as an example of “Old Europe”this was another attack on Oldthink. Political correctness is an example of theenforcement of Newspeak, but mostly it takes over simply by repetition of use.Orwellian prophecyGeorge Orwell’s vision of the new tomorrow was such a mirror of what we seetoday both in the outcome and the techniques used to achieve it. He featured a“revolutionary group” called the Resistance that the Orwellian authoritiesclaimed was led by the evil, Emmanuel Goldstein (see Osama bin Laden and endlessothers). The Resistance appears not to have really existed, but they were blamedfor every ill. One of the worst crimes a citizen could commit was to readGoldstein’s book that laid out in simple terms the structure of control underwhich the people were living. To read the book and to accept the contents wasthe ultimate thoughtcrime. More than fifty years ago Orwell described thetechnology of control such as the “Speakwrite”, a voice recognition machine, andthe “Telescreen”, two-way television with only one channel that poured out thegovernment propaganda. We are fast heading for that same situation today. We mayhave endless channels, but they are basically the same one churning out the sameunquestioned government line. Orwell talked of the “proles” or “proletarians”,which made up around 85% of the Orwellian population. They were the unthinkingmasses and the authorities looked upon them as cattle, just as they do today.They didn’t suffer the level of surveillance of those considered intellectuallydangerous because they didn’t question anything. Then there was “prolefeed”, thebrain-numbing ‘entertainment’ and made-up ‘news’ for the masses to keep themdumbed down and incapable of free thought. Spot on. There was also the“unperson”, someone removed from circulation and all files until he or sheofficially ceased to exist. To talk about an unperson was a thoughtcrime, justas to highlight the suffering, indignity and injustice imposed upon the inmatesof Guantanamo Bay is considered to be “supporting the terrorists”. Anything inany publication that put the Orwellian government in a bad light was describedin Newspeak as “malreported” or “malquoted” because the authorities were neverwrong. We are also now seeing the Orwellian ‘anti-terrorism’ programmes beingintroduced to encourage and reward the public to spy on each other and reporttheir neighbours, workmates, clients and even fellow students to theauthorities. Orwell’s nightmare world is not coming, it’s here.Erasing historyHistory may not seem to be all that important to control, but it is. By studyinghistory you can compare the assumptions and values of the world you areexperiencing. As Orwell put it: “Who controls the past, controls the future: whocontrols the present controls the past.” In fact all three are happeningtogether, but his point is valid in the way history is perceived in thisreality. The Illuminati have always sought to re-write history. The destructionand removal of the unique historical treasures and texts in the museums of Iraqwas part of that. One of the tasks of the Orwell character called Winston is toinvent a biography of a fictional soldier named Ogilvy, who can then be honouredby Big Brother in a public address. After writing the description of Ogilvy’slife, Winston marvels at how “once the act of forgery [is] forgotten, [Ogilvywill] exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne orJulius Caesar”. It is the same principle as faking the history of what happenedto Private Jessica Lynch or the real story of 9/11. By presenting a falseversion of September 11th, which is now official history, a whole series ofevents have taken place, including mass slaughter, because the people haveoverwhelmingly accepted the lie. Look at American propaganda about its ownhistory. The people are taught about the glorious victories and how their nationhas always been the bastion of freedom, justice and morality. This fabricationcolours the way many Americans view themselves and the actions of theirgovernment today. “We don’t need telling that we are going to war to liberateIraq and bring freedom and justice – that’s what we have been doing since thisgreat nation was formed.” The true history of the ‘liberators’, the UnitedStates and Britain, is one of breathtaking, grotesque, exploitation, impositionand mass murder on a scale that beggars belief. The US record on human rights isa disgrace and yet its official history emphasises its wonderful record ofgiving freedom to the oppressed. Even today, America jails five to ten timesmore of its people per head of population than any of the developed countries –some seven times more than China. The United Nations even removed the US fromits Human Rights Committee. Such is the delusion through the faking of UShistory that Texas representative, Dick Armey, gave this response to the UNdecision: “It reduces the United Nations to a farce when they expel the championof human rights.” 41No, it reduces your knowledge of your own country’s history to a farce tobelieve for a moment that this is the case. If the truth about America andBritain was in the official historical record it would be so much more difficultto sell the lie to the people when another country is due to be ‘liberated’ byextermination. Replacing Oldspeak with Newspeak is also designed to eventuallyprevent the reading of historical accounts through loss of the language and eventhe need to censor history will be eliminated.They manipulate the media? No. They own it!The Illuminati have been fast increasing their control of the global media byacquisition and merger, and through destroying the opposition by denying non-Illuminati operations the advertising that they also control. This is crucial totheir goal of brainwashing the population through hypnosis, Newspeak and thesuppression of alterative views. The American media is basically owned by fivegroups, all of which, through the Illuminati, are connected to the same agendaand you find the same in other countries. The biggest US media giant is AOL-TimeWarner and look at some of the holdings of this one company as of December 2002:> Cable and Satellite TV: HBO, America’s largest pay-TV cable network with seven> US and six international divisions, Cinemax, Time Warner Sports, CNN (10> divisions worldwide), Time Warner Cable, Road Runner, Time Warner> Communications (primarily a telephone service), New York City Cable Group, New> York 1, devoted exclusively to news in the New York City area, Time Warner> Home Theater, Time Warner Security (video monitoring), Court-TV (ownership> shared with Liberty Media), Comedy Central (ownership shared with Viacom) and> Kablevision (Hungary). > Television and Movie Companies: Warner Brothers, WB studios, WB Television,> Hanna- Barbera Cartoons, Telepictures Production, Witt-Thomas Productions,> Castle Rock Entertainment, Warner Home Video, WB Domestic Pay-TV, WB Domestic> TV Distribution, WB International TV Distribution, The Warner Channel> (separate companies for Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Australia and Germany),> and WB International Theaters in 12 countries. > Publishing: Time-Life International Books, Time-Life Education, Time-Life> Music, Time- Life AudioBooks, Book-of-the-Month Club, Paperback Book Club,> History Book Club, Money Book Club, HomeStyle Books, Crafter’s Choice, One> Spirit, Little Brown, Bulfinch Press, Back Bay Books, Warner Books, Warner> Vision, The Mysterious Press, Warner Aspect; Warner Treasures, Oxmoor House,> Leisure Arts, Sunset Books and TW Kids. > Magazines: Time, Time Asia, Time Atlantic, Time Canada, Time Latin America,> Time South Pacific, Time Money, Time For Kids, Fortune, Life, Sports> Illustrated, SI Women/Sport, SI International, SI For Kids, Inside Stuff,> Money, Your Company, Your Future, People, Who Weekly (Australia), People en> Español, Teen People, Entertainment Weekly, EW Metro, The Ticket, In Style,> Southern Living, Progressive Farmer, Southern Accents, Cooking Light, Travel> Leisure, Food & Wine, Departures, SkyGuide, Vertigo, Paradox, Milestone, Mad> Magazine, Parenting, Baby Talk, Baby on the Way, This Old House, Sunset,> Sunset Garden Guide, Health, Hippocrates, Costal Living, Weight Watchers, Real> Simple, President (Japan), and Dancyu (Japan), plus 80 other magazines in> Britain. > Record Labels: Atlantic Group, Atlantic Classics, Atlantic Jazz, Atlantic> Nashville, Atlantic Theater, Big Beat, Background, Breaking, Curb, Igloo,> Lava, Mesa/BlueMoon, Modern, Rhino Records, Elektra, EastWest, Asylum,> Elektra/Sire, Warner Brothers Records, Warner Nashville, Warner Alliance,> Warner Resound, Warner Sunset, Reprise, Reprise Nashville, American> Recordings, Giant, Maverick, Revolution, Qwest, Warner Music International,> WEA Telegram, East West ZTT, Coalition, CGD East West, China, Continental, DRO> East West, Erato, Fazer, Finlandia, MCM, Nonesuch and Teldec. > Internet: the web giant America Online or AOL.42 AOL-Time Warner is followed in size by Disney, Viacom, Vivendi Universal (whichmerged with the Bronfman family’s Seagam) and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation.This network dominates television, movies and publishing. In 1997, the filmsproduced by the four biggest motion picture companies, Disney, Warner Brothers,Paramount (Viacom) and Universal (Seagram) accounted for two-thirds of the totalbox-office receipts for the year.43 By 2003, only 20% of American newspapers,even local ones, were not owned by the media corporations and the same can befound across the world.44Michael Powell, the son of Colin Powell, and head of the US FederalCommunications Commission, is seeking to still further increase the share of themedia that one company can own and Tony Blair is doing this in Britain. Both areserving their hidden masters. With this level of media control, imagine thepotential for programming the people with the same lies and disinformation; thesame conditioned view of reality; the same Newspeak and subliminals. Imagine,too, the potential for the suppression of information and views that challengeand expose the official lies. When Alice in Wonderland and the World TradeCenter Disaster was published, copies were sent to every major televisionprogramme, radio station and newspaper in Britain and America. It is an exposéof the lies surrounding 9/11 and yet out of all those media organisations onlyone, the Sunday Herald in Scotland, contacted me. Even then they wrote a storyabout me that did not mention the content of the book. Such is our free society.The Illuminati dictate the policy and view of almost all areas of society. Oftenthrough their ‘charity foundations’, they fund ‘scientific’ research (insistingwhat the outcome will be before the money is handed over – see And the TruthShall Set You Free). This aims to hold the scientific party line about thenature of reality. They also own the pharmaceutical cartel that funds the‘medical’ system training the doctors and dispensing their lethal drugs anddestructive vaccines. They own the transnational ‘food’ corporations thatdictate what the people eat. They own the drinks corporations that decide whatthe people drink. They own the oil supplies and power companies on which modernsociety depends. All these aspects of Illuminati control are coordinated from acentral point to lay siege to our bodies, minds and freedom of choice. But byfar the most vital strand in that web is the ownership of the media to dictatewhat the people think. It is through the mind and emotions that the game isplayed with the subconscious reality the number one target. I have long beenexposing the central ownership of these apparently unconnected areas of societyand at last far more people are beginning to see it.Thinking like a reptileThe deal is simple. You know that reality is an illusion and how it is createdby the beliefs that we accept to be real. You also know that five-sensebehaviour is orchestrated from the subconscious mind and not the conscious. Thisis the experiencer and interpreter of reality, not the prime creator. Thesubconscious produces the thought fields, the wave patterns, and the consciousobserves them into holographic, illusory, reality. OK. So armed with thisknowledge you target the subconscious with an explosion of messages designed toprogramme its beliefs with the sense of reality that suits you. You areliterally hypnotising the population. A hypnotist wants to get you relaxed andinto a trance-like state that allows powerful access to the subconscious mind.He or she will then implant the messages they want you to follow when you think,and I emphasise think, the hypnosis is over. The story of the man who was toldnot to see his daughter when he came ‘out’ of his hypnotic state is a goodexample. The human population is caught in the same hypnotic trance, followingthe commands planted into the subconscious mind. This brings us back to theReptilian connection.At the heart of this conditioning, appropriately, is the most ancient part ofthe human brain known by scientists as the R-complex or reptilian brain. It isthe result of our reptilian genetic history. The Reptilians behind theIlluminati naturally know better than anyone how to manipulate the reptilianbrain and it is through this that humanity is largely controlled and directed.The human brain is in two parts, or hemispheres. We have the right brain and theleft-brain that are connected by a mass of nerve fibres. The left side is‘rational’, ‘logical’ and ‘intellectual’. It works closely with the physicalsenses and can be summed up by can I “touch it”, “see it”, “hear it”, “smell it”or “taste it”? It communicates through spoken and written words. The right brainis where we manifest imagination, intuition, instincts, dream-states and thesubconscious. It is the artist, musician and creative inspiration. Itcommunicates through images and symbols, not words. This right side is closelyrelated to the reptilian part of the brain. Reptiles communicate through imageryand symbols – like the Illuminati secret society network – and this makes thereptilian brain most open to conditioning by movies and television. ResearcherSkip Largent writes:> “All movies and television are a projection of the reptilian brain. How so?> Movies and television (video games etc.) are all undeniably dreamlike, not> only in their presentation of symbolic-reality, but also in that humans> experiencing movies, etc., have the same brain wave patterns as when they are> dreaming. And guess where dreaming originates in your head? In the reptilian> brain (although other parts of our brain are involved). The ‘language’ of the> reptilian brain is visual imagery. All communications transferred by reptiles> are done so by visual symbolic representations, each having specific meaning.” This is what the Illuminati are doing through their subliminals and symbolism.The movie and television industries are not only owned by the Illuminati; theyoverwhelmingly created them. They understand how visual images can be used tocondition the population. In normal circumstances, the reptilian-dominated rightbrain receives images through the eyes or the imagination and the left braindecodes those images into thoughts and conclusions. The Illuminati haveintervened in this process, however, to control human perception. Their aim isto disconnect the functions of these two distinct parts of the brain so we canbe manipulated through the right brain while only being aware of the left – ormanipulated through the subconscious while only being aware of the conscious.They plant images into the right brain (the dream-state, the non-conscious)using symbolism, subliminal imagery and pictures, while often telling theleft-brain how it should interpret those images. This is done through‘education’, ‘science’ and the media. Television news does this all the time.The right brain is shown pictures and the reporter’s voice-over tells the leftbrain what they mean. Show me some television news pictures without words andI’ll give you many possible explanations for what is happening. But the newsreporter only tells you about one – invariably the one given by the authorities.The left brain is told by external sources how to decode right-brain images.What we urgently need to do is regain control of our left brains and decide forourselves what we are seeing. Another aspect of the reptilian mind is the ‘hive’mentality and they have sought, very successfully so far, to transfer that hiveor herd state to the human population. This is one reason why they are sodesperate to destroy individuality of all kinds.You will find that words like imagination, imagine, dream and suchlike are usedwidely in advertising. They know that if they can use those trigger words thatencourage the right-brain, non-conscious, daydream state, they can access yoursubconscious mind with imagery and then tell your left brain how to decode thatinto conscious language – I want that car; I think the police should be givenmore powers to stop crime; I need Viagra to be a real man again; we need a worldgovernment to solve our problems. Television and movies are producing a fantasyworld of make-believe to open up the unconscious right brain and allow theIlluminati secret access through that to the conscious mind. Television andmovies are packed with subliminal messages. Children are most at risk from thisand they are being targeted by fantasy images to this end. In early childhoodthe mental state is controlled almost exclusively by the reptilian brain and thepurveyors of children’s ‘entertainment’, like Disney, exploit this knowledge. Iwas also interested to find an article in the Los Angeles Times that highlightedanother trait of the reptilian brain – greed and excess. The article was headed“Living Ever Larger; How Wretched Excess Became a Way of Life in SouthernCalifornia”. French anthropologist G. Clotaire Rapaille is quoted as saying:> “… The desire for excess comes from the ‘reptilian brain’, the earliest, most> primitive structures in our mental evolution. The reptilian wants to grab as> much food as possible, to be as big and powerful as possible, because it’s> focussed on survival. When it comes to a choice between the intellect and the> reptilian, the reptilian always wins. > “Satisfying that inner lizard has its downsides. Our insatiable appetites have> left Americans 9 pounds heavier, on average, than we were two decades ago, and> more vulnerable than ever to heart disease and diabetes. We’re racking up> mountains of debt (the late fees we pay on credit cards have more than tripled> since 1996, to $7.3 billion a year) and burning up fossil fuels like crazy. We> demand things that, deep down, we don’t really want or even use.” 45 This is how the reptilian mind sees reality and this is the world we live inbecause the Illuminati are reptilian. The whole focus is on survival and theMatrix consciousness has perhaps projected these sentient programs in areptilian form because nothing concentrates the mind more than the fear of notsurviving. We are their energy source and, through them, an energy source forthe Matrix itself. They are seeking to control us and maintain the flow of fearenergy. Their apparent arrogance is a cover for panic. What completes the circleis that once programmed with an externally implanted reality, the people whohave built their prison then police it to keep the others in. Anyone who hasanother reality at odds with the manufactured consensus is ridiculed, condemnedand generally abused for refusing to conform to the prevailing illusion.Newspeak is designed to remove even the language available to describe any otherreality, except the one the Illuminati wish to perpetuate. Round and round wego, one programmed generation programming the next, each more emphatically thanthe last. The walls close in by the day.But it doesn’t have to be like this. We can and will break the circle and weshall now look at how this is being done.SOURCES > 1 The Age of Manipulation, p 4> 2 Ibid, p 18> 3 Wilson Bryan Key, Media Sexploitation (Signet Paperback, 1977), pp 98-116> 4 Lionel Rubinoff, The Pornography of Power (Quadrangle, 1968)> 5 http://www.subliminalworld.com/COKE.HTM> [http://www.subliminalworld.com/COKE.HTM]> 6 The Age of Manipulation, p 14> 7 Dr Lechnar, “Subliminal Advertising, 20th Century Brainwashing and what’s> hidden in the Microsoft’s logo”,> http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/sublimi.htm> [http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/sublimi.htm]> 8 Ibid> 9 Ibid> 10 “SeductionVision”, http://www.hypnovision.com/adult_introduction.htm> [http://www.hypnovision.com/adult_introduction.htm]> 11 The Age of Manipulation, p 14> 12 Ibid, p 24> 13 Dr Lechnar, “Subliminal Advertising, 20th Century Brainwashing and what’s> hidden in the Microsoft’s logo”,> http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/sublimi.htm> [http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/sublimi.htm]> 14 Ibid> 15 Ibid> 16 Ibid> 17 Blue Blood, True Blood, p 76> 18 Ibid> 19 Ibid, p 77> 20 http://www.nlptrainingconcepts.com/whatis.htm> [http://www.nlptrainingconcepts.com/whatis.htm]> 21 The New Age Catalogue, 1988 edition, p 85> 22 The Fringes of Reason, A Whole Earth Catalogue: A Field Guide to New Age> Frontiers, Unusual Beliefs & Eccentric Sciences, 1989 ed., p 196> 23 Body Mind Spirit, May/June 1989, p 41> 24 http://www.learn.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=Unit&WCU=2535> [http://www.learn.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=Unit&WCU=2535]> 25 George Orwell, 1984> 26 Ibid> 27 George Orwell essay, “Politics and the English Language”> 28 http://www.washingtonfreepress.org/62/americanNewspeak.htm> [http://www.washingtonfreepress.org/62/americanNewspeak.htm]> 29 I984> 30 “A strange case of Jared Israel”, by Israel Shamir, October 3rd 2002,> http://www.israelshamir.net/english/strange.shtml> [http://www.israelshamir.net/english/strange.shtml]> 31 “Discussion on AntiSemitism”, by Israel Shamir,> http://www.israelshamir.net/english/discussionofantisemitism.shtml> [http://www.israelshamir.net/english/discussionofantisemitism.shtml]> 32 “The Other Side of Holocaust Denial” by Henry Makow Ph.D., May 19th 2003,> http://www.savethemales.ca/ [http://www.savethemales.ca/]> 33 “Discussion on AntiSemitism”, by Israel Shamir,> http://www.israelshamir.net/english/discussionofantisemitism.shtml> [http://www.israelshamir.net/english/discussionofantisemitism.shtml]> 34 Sunday Times, May 7th 2003> 35 Ibid> 36 Ibid> 37 Ibid> 38 Henry Beard and Christopher Cerf: Official Politically Correct Dictionary> and Handbook (Random House, 1993)> 39 Leicester Mercury, May 1998> 40 The Age of Manipulation, p 53> 41 “The US Gets the Boot, The UN removed the US from two important> committees”, http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ct-un_hrc.html> [http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ct-un_hrc.html]> 42 “Who Rules America”, by the Research Staff of National Vanguard Books, PO> Box 330, Hillsboro, West Virginia 24946, USA> 43 Ibid> 44 Ibid> 45 “Living Ever Larger; How Wretched Excess Became a Way of Life in Southern> California”, Los Angeles Times, June 9 2002"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENCombing the mirror > “In the cultural grip of the media, modern societies blindly stumble from one> crisis or disaster to another with the fantasized conviction that they know> what they are doing, where they are going, how they will survive, who is in> control, and why everything works or does not work as it should.

There are many researchers of thefive-sense conspiracy who believe the situation we face is now pretty muchhopeless. It has gone too far, I hear some of them say, and the people are soprogrammed with false beliefs they will never wake up and rise up in time. If Iwere looking at the world purely from five-sense reality I would agree with themand I do think that events will need to get even more blatant before the spellis broken. But that is all it is: a spell, a hypnotic state, and that isreversible anytime we choose.The Illuminati don’t orchestrate the daily assault on mind and body because theythink it’s a laugh and a bit of fun. They do it in the understanding thatconsciousness in awareness of its true and infinite power could dismantle theirmanipulated reality in an instant. They are terrified that the human collectivemind will wake up and remember what it has been programmed to forget. The foodand drink additives, genetically modified crops, ‘medical’ drugs, vaccines,electromagnetic pollution, subliminals, ‘science’, ‘education’, mediamanipulation and the suppression of alternative ways of healing and thinking aredesigned with one aim in mind: to hypnotise human consciousness and disconnectit through mind and body from its infinite potential:> “Look into my eyeeeeees. You have no power. You are ordinary and> insignificant, a chemical process destined for oblivion. You must look to your> leaders to guide you and protect you. They are the all-powerful ones who know> what you need. Only they can change your life. Obey, obey, obeeeey. When I> click my fingers you will wake up and do whatever we tell you to dooooooo …” > Click. > “Hey, honey, I’ve just been watching the TV news and I’m sure glad we have our> leaders to guide and protect us, cos’ what would we do without them? I get> this feeling we should watch a game show tonight, honey, what time does Wheel> of Fortune come on?” > “Anything on the news, Chuck?” > “I can’t remember, honey, but I think we should vote for Bush.” The suppression is actually far more potent than the indoctrination. Without thefirst you can’t have the second. A mind in its awakened state would see throughthe lies before the sentence was even complete, just as we can clearly seesubliminals once we are aware of their existence. If you go back to page 404 andlook at the picture of the plants you’ll see what I mean. The same applies tothe manufactured illusion we call the ‘world’. When we de-programme and unplugourselves from the Matrix illusion, the hypnotists suddenly lose their powerover our sense of reality. What had once been subliminal now becomes crystalclear. With this understanding, the Illuminati have sought to suppress anddemonise the knowledge of who we are and the true nature of our infinite self.Those who have talked about the other dimensions or frequency realms within theMatrix have been burned at the stake or, more latterly, ridiculed, condemned andfiled under “freaks”. But it is those who speak of Oneness, the unity of all,who offer the greatest challenge to the Matrix mentality because awareness ofthe One dismantles the illusion of duality and division on which the Matrixdepends for its control. Would Israeli soldiers kill an Arab child, or anyoneelse, if they realised that they and the child and the tank and the gun were allthe same? Would an Arab suicide bomber kill Jewish people if he had thatunderstanding? Would anyone go to war with anyone if they knew that they weretheir ‘enemy’ and their ‘enemy’ was them? It may be called an invasion of Iraq,an Arab-Israeli conflict, a murder or a state execution, but these are allexamples of people killing or attacking themselves. The human race has a fetishfor self-abuse. It is the killer and the killed, the maimer and the maimed, andthe prisoner of its own ignorance. How those beyond the illusion must despair atour plight. But it doesn’t have to be like this. It is a choice we have theinfinite power to make.Reality reloadedIt is good to be aware of the five-sense manipulation and the role ofother-dimensional entities, but by far the most important information in thisbook is about reality and how we create it. That is our getaway car. It isbecause this understanding has been suppressed that we are caught in a web ofour own making. The trouble is people don’t realise that they are the spinnerand the spun. We are creating our reality, but we think we are not. Therefore,we are not in control of the reality we create. Our ignorance has handed thatpower to anyone who can indoctrinate our belief in what is real. We create ourreality in the sense that our subconscious manifests the thought fields that theconscious mind then decodes into holographic 3-D illusions. But the control ofthose illusions comes from the subconscious beliefs that create the thoughtfields the conscious mind decodes into its daily experience. The Illuminati andtheir other-dimensional masters know that if they can program our subconsciousbeliefs they will be controlling our five-sense illusion. That’s the level atwhich the game is played and everything else is manifested from that.The loss of this knowledge has led to a process of perpetual self-delusion thatI call “combing the mirror” (Figure 63). We first accept that the world we thinkwe see around us is real and we also believe that this five-sense level of beingis who we are. Already the prison door is creaking shut. This delusion leads tothe belief that if this world is real and we are expressions of this world itfollows that we must change the five-sense world for our experience to change.Clunk! Gotcha! Now turn the key before they suss they’ve been had. Thefive-sense reality is an illusion created by our beliefs. If we don’t change ourbeliefs we cannot change the experience. That’s impossible because one is themanifestation of the other. We can run around in the five-sense reality all welike, campaigning and complaining, moaning and groaning about the state of ourlives, but nothing will change. It can’t. To transform our reality we need totransform our sense of reality because one comes from the other. When we look inthe mirror and we don’t like our hair style do we try to change it by combingthe mirror? No, we comb our hair and the mirror reflects that. Silly as it mayseem to comb a mirror to change your hair, that is what the human race is doing.It looks through its eyes at a holographic reflection, a mirror of itssubconscious sense of reality, and tries to change what it doesn’t like bycombing the mirror – seeking to change the five-sense illusion within thefive-sense illusion. To change a reflection we need to change what is beingreflected – our programmed sense of what is real. Believe small and you willreflect small. Believe no power and you will reflect no power. Believe can’t andyou will reflect can’t. And vice-versa. Billions are spending their livesthrashing around in a reflection and getting more and more frightened, angry,stressed and frustrated that nothing is changing and things are only gettingworse. But of course nothing is changing as they would wish. How can it? It’sgetting worse because the more frightened, angry, stressed and frustrated peoplebecome at aimlessly thrashing around in a reflection, while thinking it’s real,the more their mental and emotional state “gets worse” and must reflect in themirror as their world “gets worse”. It is a vicious circle that can only bebroken when we realise that five-sense reality is an illusion and we arecreating it. We can have a five-sense illusion that is a prison because innerprisons must become outer prisons; or we can have an illusion that is aparadise. It’s our choice, our decision, but whatever we choose, the five-sense‘world’ will still be an illusion, a reflection.Nailing the normsWe are creating our own universe, one unique to us. The more you redefine yourreality in relation to the consensus the more you will ‘stand out’ from thecrowd and be that nail above the rest. The reason the Illuminati seek to poundsuch people back into the pack is that they threaten to undermine the veryconsensus reality on which the Matrix depends. They show there is more than onepossible reality. Visionaries are dangerous people to the Illuminati and theywant rid of them. A maverick is a demon to a manipulator of consensus reality.The world needs a global outbreak of the STARS virus – the Sudden Tendency toAlter Reality Syndrome. We need mavericks acting with spontaneity and freedom ofthought and lifestyle, and encompassing only those current ‘norms’ that respectfreedom not servitude.Image [../Images/00069.jpg]Figure 63: The human condition – combing the mirror. How can we change areflection unless we change what is being reflected? The answers are not ‘outthere’, but ‘in here’. Illustration by Neil Hague The further you remove yourself from the collective norms the more you removethe chains of collective reality and the Matrix. Whenever we are told to do orbelieve something, no matter how mundane, it is worth considering: “Oh yeah, whodecided that?” The answer will almost always be: “I dunno.” Why are we beingdictated to by ‘norms’, the origin of which we cannot even locate? But we do itall the time. Then there is the next point: “Why should I do or believe that?”For what reason should I follow this norm? The answer here will invariably besomething like: “That’s what you have to do, everyone does it”. That’s what Ihave to do? Who says so? I am the Infinite One, I don’t have to do or believeanything I don’t wish to. And I won’t. Even better, don’t ask those questions –know the answers. I can say from my own experience that once you demand that the‘norms’ earn a place in your life you realise what mindless bullshit has beendictating your thoughts and behaviour. Talk about the emperor’s new clothes. Thenorm for norms is that normally they turn out to be baloney. A few examples:> Norm: Homosexuality is wrong or at least should not be talked about. It’s> unnatural.> Baloney: No matter what the shape of your body we can only express love for> ourselves because all is One. “I will only love myself if the other part of me> I am loving is in a different body to the one I am in.” Ugh??? Crazy, but that> is what the ‘norm’ is saying. Even if the homosexual relationship is purely> for lust and sex, so what? The body is a hologram, it’s not real. Enjoy the> illusion, but know that’s what it is and the illusion cannot control you. What> can be ‘natural’ or ‘unnatural’ in an illusion? It is a matter of free choice> and that also includes the freedom not to participate. > Norm: Sex should only happen between a man and a woman in a stable> relationship and anything beyond the missionary position is “kinky” and> “disgusting”.> Baloney: Who decided that? Who imposed this blueprint on what is ‘normal’? How> dare anyone dictate to others what they will not derive pleasure from so long> as everyone involved is agreed? No, no, you must only enjoy your illusory> hologram in ways that we decide is “moral”, otherwise we shall condemn you> (while wishing we could do the same). I’ll do you a deal.

Because as far as they know that’s the way it’s always been done!Wilson Bryan Key put it well when he wrote: “Programmed from infancy with basicassumptions, unconsciously supported ideas are usually taken for granted. Whenassumptions surface they should always be questioned.”1 Assumptions – instantreactions from conditioned belief – are the very building blocks of imprisonedreality. What is this ‘normal’ anyway? Who defines it and on what basis? What isnormal to one will not be normal to another. What is genius to one will beinsanity to another. ‘Norms’ are only beliefs that have solidified throughrepetition into unquestioned acceptance. We should let these rule our lives?Mum’s the wordThe Thought Police have a vast army of allies with which to program and controlthe global population. They are called the global population. Consensus realityis so all pervading in the minds of the masses that they are deluded intopolicing their own prison, and people conform to the manufactured consensusbecause they fear the consequences of being different. They might ask themselvesa rather important question given the circumstances now before us. Are they morefearful of the consequences of being different or those of living in a globalfascist state? It is no exaggeration to say that this is the choice we arefacing because the latter is where the consensus reality is leading us so fast.If we are not to travel that road we must disconnect ourselves from the realitythat is taking us there. That means expressing our own uniqueness and refusingto be battered into conforming to another’s version of what we should be. Thefear of expressing our uniqueness of view and lifestyle is generated from thefear of what other people think: our mothers, fathers, friends, neighbours andworkmates. If you are in the public eye there is the added fear of mass ridiculeand what the media will say about you. But I went through all this in the early1990s and I am still here, stronger than ever. There is nothing that we cannotachieve if we decide that nothing will stop us. So some brain-doner journalistwrites that I am mad. So some brain-doner reader believes it and laughs at me inthe street. So? It only matters if it is my reality that it matters and it isnot. Sod ‘em, who cares? I am me, I am free.Families, friends, neighbours and workmates often serve and police themind-prison and we need to stop conceding our uniqueness to these people. I canunderstand how difficult it is to do things that are at odds with the consensusreality and the norms as perceived by parents etc. We don’t want to see themupset and we would like them to be proud of us. Or at least most people would.But hold on here. Parents may choose to provide the apparent vehicle for us toexperience this illusion, but they do not have the right to be lifelong mindprogrammers and dictators to their offspring. Their ‘children’ are the sameOneness that they are. Parents and children are illusory states of the same Oneconsciousness and each have an equal right to express themselves. There needs tobe guardianship and basic guidance in childhood, but that is different from animposition of belief. Many parents police their children mercilessly and insistthey conform to the consensus reality that their own parents conditioned them tobelieve in. This has to stop if we are to walk the path of freedom. If parentswant to believe in consensus reality, that’s fine and proper, and their rightfulchoice. But once they seek to manipulate their children to do the same theybecome unknowing agents of the Matrix: “Your mother is so upset you want to livein a commune. Her heart was set on you being a banker/doctor/lawyer. I don’tknow if she’ll ever get over this.” Really? Well tell her to try. How come Ididn’t get upset because she wasn’t a striptease artist? I set my heart on that.As always in this illusion of duality there are two points of osculation here,the imposer and the imposed. Both are responsible for the suppression ofuniqueness and freedom of thought. Anyone who seeks to impose their reality onanother by whatever means is a psychological fascist and servant of the Matrix,but so is anyone who concedes their uniqueness to such imposition. Step one onthe road to freedom from control is to refuse to have another tell you what tothink and do with your life. If they don’t like our choice they can do the otherthing. It doesn’t matter what your parents or your friends and associates sayabout your choices. What matters is that you are you and not what someone elseis telling you to be. Why should we concern ourselves with the reactions ofthose who don’t even respect our right to be who we are? I don’t care what mychildren do with their lives, as long as it is what they truly want to do andthey respect the freedom of others to do the same. It is their choice, not mine.If we focussed on not allowing others to impose their will on us and notimposing ours on others, the difference to our lives and the world would befantastic. So much human potential is locked away behind the barrier marked:“What would people say if I said or did this?” Let it go and let it flow. Justdo it!!! Yes, you might see old ‘friends’ drift away and a whole host of newones appear. So? Great.Master of illusionAn illusion can only control you when you think it is real. Once you recognisethat your five-sense reality is an illusion it immediately loses so much of itspower over you. You still hurt your toe if you bang it on the table leg eventhough the table and your toe are only holograms. To know intellectually it isan illusion is not to know it on a level deep enough to disconnect you from itand there is still the consensus reality, the collective mind, broadcasting thebelief that it is real. You can also still get pulled into Matrix thought andreactions after you have recognised the illusion. I have heard this called“having a 3-D moment”. “How dare you say that to me? … I’m going to …” Stop!!Deep breath. Three-D moment. It’s an illusion remember? Yeah, shit, what was Ithinking? OK, I’m fine again now. Phew! Naturally this happens as you begin tounplug, but the control the Matrix has over you starts to diminish. I have foundthat if you keep telling yourself it is all an illusion, a dream world, youbegin to ‘see’ that fact with ever increasing clarity. Another thing I havefound interesting is to be consciously aware that you are seeing from your brainand not your eyes. It is a case of recognising that what you think you areseeing is happening in the visual cortex in the brain and not in your eyes. Idon’t know what others may experience when they do this, but the world seemsvery different to me.As the process of unplugging continues, things that mattered to you beforebecome less important and your outlook on life and yourself starts to transform.You become more tolerant of yourself and others. When you see it’s an illusionand we are all the same Oneness creating our experience, what is there to getworked up about? The only time I am interested in what other people do is whenthey are imposing their will on others, as the Illuminati are on the rest of us.Short of that what people do is entirely up to them and it’s none of mybusiness. Your attitudes to everything change once the recognition of theillusion goes deeper and deeper and you start to be that awareness rather thanjust intellectually accept its existence. Don’t think it, know it. Don’t try todo it, just do it. These are very different states of being. When you becomemore consciously aware of the illusion, you can begin to enjoy it without allthe hang ups that imprison us when we think it is real. We can have fun andexpress our desires, as long as they don’t impinge on the freedom of others. Myoutlook is that I will try anything I fancy and if I don’t like it I won’t do itagain. If I do like it I will do it as often as I like. The Matrix illusion usesfear and guilt to hold us in its grasp. If we have an experience we don’t likeor wish we had not done, the guilt and trauma can stay with us for a lifetimeeffecting our every reaction. But when you know that our 3-D experiences takesplace in a dream world, their effect is far less profound. Are we effected for alifetime by the experiences we have in our nightly dreams? We might wake upfeeling fearful and shocked now and again because the dream seemed so real, butsoon the feeling is gone and we can even laugh about it. “It was only a dream”,we say. Yes, and so is this, albeit a lucid one. The only difference is that weare conditioned to believe that this dream is real and its effect upon us iscompounded a trillion times. We can remove its control by not only seeing, butliving the fact that this is only a dream that we are creating. ‘Death’ is onlythe awakening from a dream and nothing to fear.Seeing through the mirrorWhen we observe our daily experience we are looking at a mirror of ourselves. Itis a mirror of our belief in what is real. It’s no good us blaming anyone elsefor what we don’t like in our lives, the responsibility is ours. Taking thatresponsibility and ceasing to blame others – or ourselves come to that – is totake a massive step on the freedom road. The power the Illuminati use to controland manipulate us is only the power we give away to them and others every day.The most destructive expression of this is blaming others for our plight. To dothat is to accept that others have power over our lives and the reality wecreate. In truth, only we have that power if we choose to use it; but if webelieve that others are in control of our destiny we will create that reality.The Illuminati are not the only ones responsible for the world as it is. Howcould they be? There are only a relative handful of them working in awareness ofthe goal. A few manipulate and billions allow themselves to be manipulated.Where does the real responsibility lie? We can’t be controlled unless we allowourselves to be and, crucially, insist that others do the same. Divide and ruleis the bottom line of all dictatorships and the human race has conceded to thaton a mega scale. Arab is turned against Jew, black against white, Right againstLeft, in the way the Matrix must operate to maintain its control by duality anddivision. Unplugging from the Matrix means refusing to recognise these illusoryfault lines. We are all One. I refuse to see a Jew as different from an Arab andvice versa. They are both expressions of the One and need to be observed andtreated the same, none more or less important than the other. I refuse to seeblack people in terms that I would not see white, nor to see the ‘Left’ as Iwould not see the ‘Right’. How could it be any different, except when we believethe illusion of division is real? If we do that, the Matrix has us. It promotesthe illusion of division and duality and if we accept that, the trap istriggered. There is no way out of an illusion based on division if we buy thebelief that the division is real.Ditching doublethinkEveryone else’s freedom is our freedom. If one person does not enjoy the freedomof all others then none are free. Once again, how can they be? A little bit offreedom is no freedom. This is a simple truth that the robot radicals of theLeft and the robot righteous at the other polarity cannot seem to grasp. Freedomof speech is not only the freedom for others to say what is acceptable to us.That is tyranny. It is the freedom to express your thoughts, no matter how muchwe may not agree with them. A truly free society (and those who believe infreedom rather than using it as a weapon of coercion) would campaign as fiercelyfor the freedom of people with whom they disagree as they would for those theysupport. But what happens? The opposite. The leadership, and I emphasise theleadership, of the British and Canadian Green Parties have campaigned to stop mespeaking in public. The British Green Party banned me from speaking at theirconference years ago, despite an invitation from members, because I was sayingthings about reality and the nature of life that they thought would lead to thembeing ridiculed. The ‘Anti-Nazi’ League in Britain organised protests at some ofmy events years ago when, ironically, I have been warning of the rise of theFourth Reich (or the overt re-emergence of the Third) since the early 1990s. Yetask any of these people what they think about freedom of expression and theywill say it is a fundamental human right. What an example of Orwell’sdoublethink, the ability to hold two contradictory views and believe both to betrue. It is possible to encompass the apparent paradoxes of life in that thesame event can look very different from different points of observation and allcan be true from the perspective of the observer. But that is not the same asdoublethink. Either you believe in freedom of speech or you don’t. Freedom ofspeech for one, but suppression for those you don’t like is not freedom ofspeech. Anyone who seeks to prevent the free expression of thought by anyoneelse is an agent of control and they should know that before their self-delusionleads to the very fascist Orwellian state they claim to oppose. Orwell must besquirming at the antics of those people.We need to start focussing on the right to freedom of expression because what ishappening – and what the robot radicals are seeking to enforce – is the same aswhat occurred in Nazi Germany. Books unacceptable to the Nazi Party were bannedand burned; those who tried to speak out against the Nazis had their publicmeetings banned or disrupted; others were jailed and killed for their views.This is happening today and the robot radicals are often the vehicle throughwhich it is done. Some home truths for these deluded people: if it is OK to talkabout Arab or Islamic extremism and terrorism it must be OK to talk about Jewishextremism and terrorism. If it is not we do not live in a free and fair society.If it is OK to say that the official version of history is true, it must be OKto say the official version is not true. If it is not we do not live in a freeand fair society. If what the alternative history claims is not correct then theevidence produced by official history will demolish it. So what’s the problem?It is not a matter of agreeing or not agreeing; it is about the right to expressones thoughts like everyone else. Once that freedom is curtailed all freedomsare doomed. How is it possible to have a free debate or come to informedconclusions when one view is constantly emphasised and another suppressed? Thedepths of immaturity beggar belief. But the robot radicals are far more obsessedwith posturing their own self-righteousness and self-purity – “Look at me, I’manti-Nazi and anti-racist, I’m such a good person” – than ever they are atpromoting or defending freedom for all. Doublethink, doublethink, doublethink.It is terminal (for freedom) self-indulgence.I hear people ask about those who would use their freedom of speech to call forviolence against others or encourage sexual acts with children. But wouldn’t yourather have such people in the open where they can be seen and identified thanhave them doing exactly the same in secret? Why is it fine for George Bush, TonyBlair and Co to call by the hour for violence against Iraq, Afghanistan and along list of others to come, and yet it is not fine for others to do the same ona much lesser scale of potential slaughter? It is doublethink and doublestandards. If one is illegal, so should be the other, or rather t’other wayround. If someone is calling for violence against others or the abuse ofchildren I want to know about it, not have it go on behind the scenes unexposedwhere nothing can be done. This is what happens when you suppress freedom ofexpression, you push it underground where it festers and often prospers beyondour awareness. Let’s have it out in the open where we can deal with it and knowwhat we are dealing with. If you see someone supporting sex with children, youknow to keep your children well away from him. If such views cannot be expressedhow would you know to protect your kids from him or her? Laws to defend freedom,the freedom not to be murdered, abused and subjected to violence etc., are onething. Laws to curtail freedom of expression are quite another. We only need one‘law’: do what you like, but don’t do it by removing the freedom of others. Ifyou think about it, no other law is necessary and it can be filed under a simpleheading – the Law of Respect.To purge ourselves of the Matrix mentality we need to be aware of our owndoublethink. This is almost a barometer of our sense of disconnection becausethe more we become aware of reality the less doublethink we manifest.Doublethink is largely the product of prejudice and rigid belief because thiscolours our judgement of everything. When America attacks another country in thename of liberation while killing thousands of civilians and wreaking utterdevastation, the acceptance that “liberation” and “mass slaughter” can both betrue comes from (a) the bias most Americans have towards America and (b) thebelief that their nation is the global home of freedom and justice. Once you seeeverything as One, there is no ‘America’ or ‘Iraq’ and there is no bias to oneor the other. Your only measurement is freedom, fairness and justice for all inany given circumstances. You can see how the politicians prepare the people toencompass the doublethink. George Bush’s speechwriters have had him say:> “See, we love – we love freedom. That’s what they didn’t understand. They hate> things; we love things. They act out of hatred; we don’t seek revenge, we seek> justice out of love. > “You need to tell your loved ones, the little ones in particular, that when> they hear the president talking about al-Qaeda, Iraq and other places, I do so> because I long for peace. > “I want to send the signal to our enemy that you have aroused a compassionate> and decent and mighty nation, and we’re going to hunt you down.” Orwell could have written that. Such nonsense is designed to prepare the peopleto accept the doublethink: love is killing; mass murder of the innocent is notrevenge, it is justice and love; endless war is a longing for peace. Thereference to a “compassionate and decent and mighty nation” is there to make thepeople feel good about themselves and “mighty” through the weapons ofdestruction wielded by the troops that will kill thousands in their name. It isthe old John Wayne mentality that is leading vast tracts of the American psychelike a lamb to the slaughter house. The doublethink trap is to give the peoplethe choice between the belief they are loving, compassionate, decent and mightyor that their government is guilty of mass murder and imperial conquest. Theywant to believe the first is true, but they are faced with the fact that theirtroops have invaded another nation and are killing its civilians (although thescale of this is suppressed). To square the circle they resort to self andcollective dishonesty, accept the doublethink, and believe that bothcontradictory beliefs are true. This is the way doublethink prospers and theantidote is to free ourselves of bias and beliefs set in concrete. We are notAmericans or British, Israeli or Iraqi, we are the One. These labels areillusions and why should we be biased in our perception of fairness and justiceby favouring one expression of the One against another? The murder of a child inAfghanistan, Iraq, or Palestine is no more or less important than the murder ofa child in New York or Tel Aviv. We are in this together and we need to grow upand realise we are all the same.United States of AmnesiaThe United States is the spiritual home of doublethink and self-deception. It isan Orwellian society that thinks it is the freest country in the world and hasthe right to impose the same Orwellian ‘freedom’ on everyone else. Individuallythey are overwhelmingly lovely people, but, as I have said before, there is alevel of the American collective psyche that is forever John Wayne. Or, as TomFoley, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, put it:“Individually, we are reasonably modest, but collectively, we have been toldagain and again that we are the greatest thing in the history of the world.” 2The former head of the CIA, Admiral Stansfield Turner, said that if anyone saysthe United States is not fit to be an imperial power the burden is on them tosay why. Well, as this book has shown, that doesn’t take long. His reasons forwhy the US is fit to run an empire are revealing of the American collectivepsyche. They “won” the Cold War (what has that got to do with it?); they are themost democratic country in the world (with an unelected president); they are thebest example of “free enterprise” (controlled by a cartel of corporations thatdestroy free enterprise across the globe); and the world needs a leader and noone else can do it (it doesn’t).3 Turner conceded that America knew little aboutthe world it was intending to “lead” (control), but “we believe ours is theright way”.4 His words betray an arrogance and ignorance (the two invariably gotogether) that you find with Bush-supporting Americans. One lady, Bea Kristolfrom Washington, was interviewed by the UK Daily Telegraph about Americanimperialism and was puzzled and shocked by the very suggestion: “But the word‘imperial’ implies that there is something in it for America.”5 Yep, she reallysaid that and no doubt believed it. Taking over Iraqi oil and handing outfantastic contracts to US companies to rebuild what the US invasion haddestroyed does not imply there is something in it for America even on thatlevel? Doublethink. Robert Joss, the Dean of Stanford Business School, said thatAmericans (though not all by any means) genuinely feel they are “trying to bringgoodness to everybody else”.6 Tom Foley said Americans had a “very pervasivenotion of our good intentions”. This led to an assumption that “any sort ofobjective examination of the United States must result in approval, if notvigorous applause”.7 Michael Ignatieff, director of the Carr centre in theKennedy School of Government at Harvard, gave this excellent summary of whyAmericans are so easy to manipulate: “There is nothing more frightening thanAmerican innocence. It’s a fearsome, sometimes murderous innocence. Ourinability to question our own motives is truly alarming.”8 Failing to questionmotives is essential to doublethink. Ignatieff said that America was controlledby an ideology, “but like all ideologies, it doesn’t believe it is one. It justbelieves that it is the Truth.” 9America’s ideology believes it is fine to spend hundreds of billions a year onweapons of mass destruction while 43 million Americans can’t afford healthinsurance. Doublethink again. But Orwellian mind-control in America is sopowerful and all-pervading that you can understand how this mentality is formed.Schoolchildren are told every day to face the US flag and say: I pledgeallegiance to the flag of the United States of America … one nation under God,indivisible and with liberty and justice for all. “I have my three-year-oldsdoing it”, said Teresa West, head teacher of the Glen Forest elementary schoolin Falls Church, Virginia.10 Wanda Nelson, deputy head of Lake Anne School inReston, said: “We do it at 8.25 every morning. If one of the children comes latewith their parents and the pledge is announced over the loudspeakers, they stopdead in their tracks and say it right there, children and parents alike.”11 Whenshe was told that we don’t even have flags in British schools, she was shocked.“You have no flags? How on earth do you engender patriotism?” What she can’tseem to grasp is that patriotism should not need to be engendered. Only false,blind, patriotism needs that. It should come without pressure from a pride inthe decency and sense of justice a country truly stands for and not through thebrainwashing of a lie. One British couple who moved to the US told the DailyTelegraph that after only a month at an American school their children werecoming home singing patriotic songs. America is the world’s most mind-controllednation (together with Israel) and has long lost the ability to collectivelythink straight. So it doublethinks – or doesn’t think at all. Anila Daulatzai, ayoung American of Afghan parents, was invited to teach a class about Afghanistanand she asked the students if they would like to know more about Afghanistan(who the US was bombing at the time) and Pakistan. Most said they didn’t havethe time. Anila went on:> “Almost 60 per cent of the class were white American males who wanted to serve> in the US government … I suggested that we might take a more critical look at> the nature of the US involvement in that area. How they built up the Taliban> to fight against the Soviet Union. How they had used Osama bin Laden in that> effort. How they had built up Saddam, used him and then turned against him as> the evil one. I said those things in a very neutral way – and I did know> something about the area, because I spent a long time working in refugee camps> there. > “It didn’t make any difference. Students started raising their hands and> saying: ‘I don’t agree with what you’re saying’; ‘America is the greatest> place on Earth’; ‘If you don’t like it here, go back to where you came from’.> I pointed out that I was born up the street; that I had thought the point of> an academic institution was to debate issues in a courteous way and that we> were not on a Fourth of July parade in a bar. This, I’m afraid, is an ignorant> and arrogant nation.” 12 All these reactions are straight from the pages of 1984. I have been saying forsome years that the United States was created as a mind-control experiment,ultimately controlled from Europe and it is clearly working. It is because thepeople see everything as ‘parts’, like ‘Americans’ and ‘Afghans’ or ‘Iraqis’that the attitudes expressed above are possible. Only with an understanding ofOneness can the conflict and injustice wane. Fortunately there are tens ofmillions of Americans – and growing – who do not fall for the doublethinkpromoted by their government and it is through them that the change is coming.Hypocritic oathsIt is worth being aware of our responses to people and events and to constantlyscan our views for doublethink, as well as the statements of the politicians andmanipulators. This is especially the case with those who hold strong politicalor religious views. They are fodder for doublethink. Christian doublethinkerssupport war and ask God to bless the troops doing the killing while claiming toserve Jesus, the “Prince of Peace”. Religion and politics are the headquartersof doublethink. Over thousands of years, religion has brilliantly served thestructure for human control. They have indoctrinated the populous withprison-of-the-mind belief systems that should never be questioned. They haveimposed those beliefs through fear, indoctrination, isolation and the attemptedgenocide of non-believers. They have fought each other for dominance of thehuman mind, producing an explosion of opportunity for the Illuminati to divideand rule for millennia. The major religions have their origins in the veryregion of the world, the Near and Middle East, from whence so much of theIlluminati network emerged. More coincidence? Not a chance. Religions arecreations of dualism and division. They promote the dualities of good and evil,God and the people, and while they say “God is everywhere”, what are reallysaying is that ‘He’ is only interested in an exclusive contract based onbelieving what the men-in-frocks tell you to believe. They say they support“right” against “wrong”, but then, when it suits them, they decide that ‘right’and “wrong” are the same. They quote Jesus as saying “turn the other cheek”, butthen back wars of conquest, murder and robbery. Again, here is the prejudicenecessary for doublethink. These are wars against Muslim countries, thenon-believers, and surely this is a case of onward Christian soldiers? The waris serving the desires of ‘Jesus’, this doublethink goes, because it is riddingthe world of a religion that is in competition with their own corporate brand.Also the US president is a Satanic … er, sorry, Christian, believer and he isserving the cause of Jesus. Extreme Islamic fanatics (far fewer in number thanthe propaganda claims), believe that they need to rid the world of the Christianand Jewish non-believers and they support violence against them in the name ofserving the cause of their religion. Round and round and round. Former House ofRepresentatives Speaker, Tom Foley, talked of the power that religion has overthe American mind:> “We are not a nation which prays in the closet. We expect the President to be> our principle preacher, to express constantly the idea that God has showered> us with special blessings and that we, therefore, have a special identity, a> special mission in the world. It is a mission which is realised in part by> just being who we are, but which also requires us to encourage others to be> just like us.” 13 This “encouragement” includes dropping bombs on people. Hey, that’ll make themmore like us. They have been “saved!!” Hallelujah, praise the Lord. There aremany Christians, Muslims and Jews who do not fall for the doublethink becausethey either have the intelligence to see through it and/or they express thepeaceful and compassionate versions of their faith. However, when you concedeyour Oneness and infinite possibility to a desperately limited religious belief(as they all are) you are thinking duality and limitation, the mentality of theMatrix, and there is no way home until its victims free themselves from thoseclerical clutches.Watching the wordsThere is a simple ‘rule’ for seeing through the Newspeak and doublethink ofpoliticians and their ilk. It is this: whatever they say they mean the opposite;whatever they claim, the opposite is true. “Will” means “won’t” and “won’t”means “will”; “I do” means “I don’t” and “I don’t” means “I do”; “I believe inpeace” means “I believe in war”; “It has not been decided” means that it has;“It has been decided” means that it hasn’t; “Conflict is not inevitable” meansthat it is; “So and so country is dangerous to the world” means it is no threatto anyone; “I never had sexual relations with that woman” means …well, you knowwhat it means. The Illuminati have an entire spoken and symbolic language basedon meaning reversal. Writer Michael Ellner described the society that suchreversal creates: “Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything isupside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universitiesdestroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroyinformation and religions destroy spirituality.” Watch the political andmilitary leaders and you will realise that seeing through them really is verystraightforward. Most of the time there is no need even to read between thelines; just reverse the apparent meaning of the statement.If we observe the ‘news’ programmes and political outpourings of propaganda fromthis perspective these one-time instruments of persuasion are immediatelyneutered. When you use this technique it can be frustrating to see the scale ofthe daily lies that people like Bush, Blair and their cronies are prepared totell, but it can also be funny because they’re pathetic really. Mostimportantly, by reversing their statements they are telling you what they areplanning to do or what they are saying really means. Jack Straw, the BritishForeign Secretary, said that the latest superstate constitution of the EuropeanUnion “… does not significantly change the relationship between the EU and itsmember sovereign nations”. Once more the reverse is true. George Bush said thegovernment “has taken unprecedented measures to defend our homeland and, moreimportantly, we will continue to hunt the enemy down before he can strike”. Thismeans they have taken unprecedented measures to impose control of Americancitizens and will continue to invade and conquer any country they choose eventhough that country has not attacked anyone. The principle of meaning reversaland non-specific blandness applies to all Newspeak. Reverse the apparent meaningand you see the real meaning. Remember, too, that the line pushed by themainstream media about a person or event has originated almost every time fromgovernments and their spinners and is aimed at getting you to accept theirversion of the story.Political incorrectnessThe other point with regard to language is simply to defend it from extinctionas we know it. We need to ensure that Oldspeak is not replaced inexorably by thesmoke-and-mirrors of Newspeak that already comprises today’s politicalvocabulary. This means using the language and refusing to bow to the Gulagagents of political correctness or ‘PC’. “You can’t use those words” = you watchme, darlin’. If we refuse to use the ludicrous language of the PC Plods (oops,reference to the policeman in the Noddy children’s stories with its charactercalled ‘Big Ears’ that might be seen as a slight against those with verticallyendowed hearing devices). I’ll try again. If we refuse to use the ludicrouslanguage of the PC Plods there is nothing they can do, just as if everyonerefused to pay street parking fines, the system would collapse. The destructionof specifics in language, the crucial specifics necessary to articulate freethought, is only possible if we accede to it. I will not do that to the day Idie (or experience the negatively perceived consequences of age advancement).Hey, I just thought. Surely to die of old age is cosmic ageism? Why should oldpeople be discriminated against when it comes to death? Statistics show that farmore old people die than young. Outrageous. God is an ageist! Condemn Him(sexist). No, condemn Her (sexist, though not as bad). No, condemn Him-Her(maybe). Yeah, Him-Her is an ageist. How you live and learn, I never knew. (“MrIcke, we have had a discussion and we feel there is still a male bias here. Webelieve that there needs to be affirmative action with regard to the female andwe have therefore decided that Her-Him is the appropriate term”.) I have a largeplunger in my hand and I wonder what the term is for where I am going to shoveit.More escapologyAs we have seen, our minds are being assaulted with subliminals to program ourreality. But research has found that even if you can’t actually see subliminalmessages their effectiveness is dramatically reduced when you are aware they arethere. It is worth noting to yourself when you read a paper or magazine, watchtelevision or even walk down the street that you know you are receivingsubliminal and symbolic messages, but you reject them. You can consciously placemental barriers in your subconscious by visualising a shield, or whatever formyou want the barrier to take, blocking the subliminals. Visualisation is simplya way of focussing the mind on what you wish to repel and you can then do sowithout needing to constantly think about it. You are using the power of yourmind to block the influence of the subliminals, which depend on people beingunaware of them. Bringing the hidden into conscious awareness dilutes its power,as, again, we can see with the example of the ‘sex’ in the picture of theplants. Awareness is the key.Subliminal techniques are the exploitation of human denial. We don’t see whatour denial does not want to see. For this and other reasons it is good to behonest about what we are denying about ourselves. We are all in denial ofsomething and while it is there it eats away at us affecting us mentally andemotionally from beyond the conscious threshold. We are what we are, allglorious expressions of the same Infinite One. What are you hiding from yourselfabout yourself? What am I? True freedom demands that we find out, be honest withourselves, and let the denial go. With the denial eliminated, often the desirealso goes.I have a fetish for being whipped with a garden hose. There, said it, it’s outnow, I feel so much better. Actually, that’s not true (it’s really a rubberthong). No, no, shut up Icke, while you’re still ahead. The point is though,that if I did get a thrill from a garden hose, so the hell what? Would I behurting anyone, other than myself, by free choice? Would it mean I was a badperson or my work would be less credible? No, it would not. Then, why thedenial? Answer: “The fear of what others would think” – the bottom line reasonfor denial of self.This does not only apply to sexual themes. People deny that they are frightenedor lack confidence and they erect ‘front personalities’ that appear to exudecourage and self esteem, to hide the reality of how they really feel. Thesehidden insecurities can then be exploited. There is nothing wrong with feelingfear or lacking self esteem. They are potential manifestations of the One, whenin a state of illusory disconnection. Face them and they can be dealt with. Denythem and you give them power over you and your ability to see through theillusion. We cannot be honest with others until we are honest with ourselves andit is our lack of self-honesty that the manipulators so exploit.You’re a failure? Oh yeah? Who says?Insecurity is one of the manipulators’ prime weapons. They give us ‘role models’in every walk of life to whom we are supposed to aspire and against whom we areencouraged to judge our own ‘success’. Ladies, look at these rich and famousactresses and models, aren’t they just sensational? Oops, you don’t look likethem do you? What a shame. But don’t despair. Buy our creams, hairspray andplastic surgery and you, too, could be beautiful just like Julia. Hey, guys, doyou want to be attractive to women like Brad? Well just give us a credit cardnumber and we’ll change the shape of that terrible nose or fill your penis withfat to make women swoon. You, too, could be like Arnie Schwartzeneger. Go on,you know you want to; that’s how real men should be. (What, muscle bound withonly one expression??) We are also encouraged to identify with a group toensnare us in the herd mentality. Americans are told to feel proud about the‘victories’ of their military, even though they do not get within thousands ofmiles of a bullet being fired. Never mind, the troops are American and we areAmerican, so we are the same team and we are all ‘victors’. If you can equateindividual ‘success’ with national ‘success’ and military ‘success’, you can getmillions to support your wars of slaughter because the population associatethemselves (quite wrongly) with the power and might of the country. We might beliving in a slum on the breadline, with no health insurance, but we are part ofa great and powerful nation.Among the main ways we are held in the illusion, the headlights of thefive-senses, is by focussing our minds 24/7 on materialism. That is not say itis ‘spiritual’ to be poor and live in a dump; that’s equally silly. It is notthe material objects in themselves that are the trap. They are only holographicillusions anyway. It is to see them as the goal, the symbols of success thatconfirm we have, or have not, ‘made it’. Once our symbols of success are allmaterial, this is the level at which we will primarily operate and ourmulti-dimensional infinite self will be kept on the sidelines because the onlygame in town is money and what it can do for me. Our society is totally focussedon the five-senses, stimulating them, enticing them, exploiting theirmanipulated desires for sound, scene, taste, smell and feel. Listen to thissong; look at this woman; taste this wine; smell this perfume; feel this hand onyour … yeah, yeah, OK, we get your drift. There is nothing wrong with any ofthese sensations (mine’s a glass of red wine and a record by Queen), but thefive-sense trap is to believe that this is all there is. To hold us in theillusion the symbols of success are all related to the five-senses and this iswhere insecurity comes in. Most people don’t find their sense of security,self-esteem and ‘success’ from within themselves. They look to others to tellthem or confirm they are ‘successful’ and ‘doing well’. To elicit this reactionthey have to ‘succeed’ in the terms the people around them have been conditionedto perceive as success – big car, big house, lots of money in the bank. This isthe whole basis of the ‘American Dream’ that has held that nation’s collectivemind in slavery for centuries. When you don’t ‘succeed’ in these terms (and thevast majority can’t because the system is rigged for the few) they areconsidered, and often consider themselves, a failure. This lack of self-esteemcan then be further exploited and the ‘losers’ are held up as an example of whathappens if you don’t keep chasing the ‘dream’. The whole insane system dependsin its entirety on consumption and the constant expansion of consumption; peopleare pressured and enticed to consume more with every year and to consider theamount they consume as a measurement of their ‘success’. The obsession to‘succeed’ in this way leads to people borrowing more and more money to providethe trinkets that display their alleged ‘success’ while they spend their livesin perpetual terror of not being able to meet the repayments. Every year themerry-go-round gets faster and faster and faster and faster and faster, faster,faster, faster, stress, ulcer, heart attack, faster, faster, faster …Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!That is success?? Illuuuuuuuuuuuusion.Money and fame do not happiness make. That is not to say there is anything wrongin itself to have money and be well known. It’s just an experience. But it isnot the key to the door marked happiness, contentment and fulfilment. It iscertainly not a ticket to a Oneness concert. Whether you are Brad Pitt or Ethelnext door, the road home lies within not without. We will travel home in a newreality, not a new Ferrari. I have come across a lot of rich and famous peoplein my life and I have not met many who were happy, contented and fulfilled,especially when they stopped and looked back at their lives and asked what itwas all for. Often they get so absorbed in pursuing the material ‘dream’ theycan’t see the twigs, never mind the forest. Little matters like love, happiness,contentment, relationships, who they are and what they are doing here, are lostin a blur of daily activity chasing the rabbit in the top hat. They become humandoings, not beings. They exist rather than live because they have forgotten whatliving is. Ironically, by withdrawing from the five-sense obsession withpossession and remembering who we are, we can give ourselves the power tomanifest whatever we want. The five-sense world is an illusion, the creation ofour minds, and that includes wealth and poverty and all in between. A Ferrari isa thought field, so why can’t it be yours if that is what you want? It can, butonly if you become deeply connected to the process of holographic manifestationthat you can consciously create whatever you desire. Once you know the materialtrinkets are illusions and symbols of nothing but manifested thought, they losetheir control over us; we can enjoy them, if that is what we choose to do. Whenwe know the illusion is not real we control the illusion, not the other wayround. We live life instead of life living us.OK, time for a break. Now, where’s that garden hose? Paaaam, I’m ready!!SOURCES > 1 The Age of Manipulation, p 38> 2 “An American Odyssey”, Part One, by Graham Turner, Daily Telegraph, June> 16th 2003, pp 13-15> 3 Ibid> 4 Ibid> 5 Ibid> 6 Ibid> 7 Ibid> 8 Ibid> 9 Ibid> 10 Ibid> 11 Ibid> 12 Ibid> 13 Ibid"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENHeart of the matter > You cannot solve problems with the same level of intelligence that created> them. > Albert Einstein In the first Matrix movie, Neo (“The One”), overcame ‘death’ and transformed hisawareness beyond the illusion in a hotel called the ‘Heart O’ the City’. Thiswas clearly no coincidence in such a symbolic production. It is through theheart that we connect with the Oneness of all and see through the veil ofillusion, the veil of fears.I talk about us being disconnected from Oneness, but I only use that term tokeep it simple. In fact, we are not disconnected at all. We can’t be because theOne is always the One. To put it more accurately, we have fallen for theillusion of disconnection, duality and polarity, and as such we create theholographic appearance of disconnection. We do not need to be reconnected, wesimply have to realise that we were never disconnected. The sense of division isan indoctrinated illusion. The apparent experience of disconnection comes whenwe close our heart chakra, our direct link to Oneness, and become mesmerised bythe illusory world of the ‘head’, the mind. The heart chakra or vortex is thebalance point for the other six major chakras and that is an expression ofOneness: the balance of all (Figure 64, overleaf). That is what ‘love’ is: thebalance of all. Balance – Oneness in awareness of itself – does not havepolarities between which to vibrate. One cannot oscillate with One because therecan be only one ‘One’. As I experienced myself in the Amazon, Oneness does notvibrate; it is still. Thus, spiritual people talk about the stillness of theheart. They are speaking of the stillness of Oneness that we express through theheart vortex. What do we say when we see the troubles of the ‘world’? “It makesmy heart ache” and “It breaks my heart”. These feelings relate to Onenessobserving the illusion through the heart and our empathy with another expressionof the One suffering the consequences of illusory disconnection. My heart achesbecause I know it does not have to be like this and I know how it could be if wewould only remove the chains that bind us to illusion.If we experience the world through the heart and not the head, our whole realityis transformed. Instead of ‘thinking’ what to do, we feel it, or know it in theheart; the place from where you feel love or where you feel your heart ache.This is our connection with the One in our Matrix state and the Illuminati seekconstantly to close the heart vortex through events that trigger fear,resentment and a desire for revenge. The whole global economic system isdesigned to this end – to generate competition and conflict that divides thesense of One; and to create a daily cycle of stress that comes from chasing thematerial ‘dream’ and illusory ‘success’, or seeking to survive on the scrapsthat are left for those cast aside in the stampede for the pig trough. It isharder to open your heart when you hate the guy in the job that you want or whenthere is far more week than wages. To generate the energy of fear on which theirmasters depend, the Illuminati have to close the heart chakra; for only thenwill we be dominated by the emotional states that the heart knows are onlyillusions of mind. Energy flows where attention goes, as they say, and we arepressured to focus our attention on fear, resentment, revenge and survival.Frustration is a massive heart suppressor. It is no surprise that studies haverevealed how those who score high in hostility and aggression are seven timesmore likely to die of a heart attack than those who score low.1 These emotionssuppress the heart chakra and reduce the flow of energy. This creates acompressed field of energy that manifests through the physical heart as a heartattack. There you have the basis on which stress causes heart disease.But if we do not concede our reality to these manipulated emotions, we riseabove them and they no longer dictate our health or how we see ourselves andothers. When we feel and know from our heart we find empathy with all otherexpressions of the One. The heart does not identify with being American orBritish or Jewish or Arab. It identifies only with Oneness, balance, fairnessand justice for all. It does what it believes to be right, no matter what or whois involved. Those who manipulate the John Wayne mentality in America to gleansupport for their wars of conquest would have no chance if they were speaking toopen hearts. These would reject immediately the idea of violence against anyone.The heart knows that this only begets more violence and that all violence is theOne attacking itself. With open hearts all war would end through lack ofinterest. But the Illuminati bypass the wisdom of the heart and target the headthat sees reality in terms of us and them – good guys (us) and bad guys (them).The head believes that it is American or British, Arab or Jew. It sees only theparts, not the whole. It believes in light and dark, left and right, good andevil; and such entrenched belief creates this illusory duality. It edits what it‘sees’ to confirm its beliefs and it sees what it is told to see. One example ofthis is the belief in God Bless America, Land of the Free, fulfilling itsGod-given destiny to bring peace and justice to the world by promoting violenceand injustice. All ideology is the Matrix at work. Ideology is the illusion thatthere is only one way and its advocates are the zealots that seek, in theirarrogant self-obsession, to impose their beliefs on others. How can there beonly one way when you are dealing with infinity? There can only be infinite waysbecause the Infinite is all possibility. Wisdom is diversity; ideology is, well,bloody stupid. Wilson Bryan Key writes:> “The moment anyone accepts an objective reality, an eternal truth, they have> become vulnerable, manipulable, and eminently exploitable. They have ceased to> function as an autonomous, creative, thinking individual, living in an> integrated, interdependent, world.”2 Image [../Images/00070.jpg]Figure 64: The heart chakra, the ‘spiritual heart’ and our connection with the‘One’. Illustration by Neil Hague If you can give a term or title for what you are and believe, the Matrix hasyou. I don’t care if you call yourself an American, an Arab, a Jew, an Aussie,an African or Chinese; you are thinking division and thinking small. Or are youa Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim? Then the Matrix has you. These areideologies, the belief in some absolute truth within the infinity ofpossibility. There is no single answer to anything. Advocates of these religionswould deny vehemently that they are ideologies, especially Buddhism. But so longas they can give themselves a name they must be. The truth just is; we all justare. It is the force with no name.When we “think” and observe from an open heart, we are accessing infinitebalance, love, wisdom, knowing. The intuitive becomes the guide that leads usthrough the maze of manipulation that entraps the head in illusion it believesto be real. Seeing is not believing; not even feeling is believing; knowing isbelieving, or rather knowing is knowing. Belief is an illusion of mind. As wesurrender to the heart, the head begins to view reality from another, greater,perspective. In doing so, it becomes One with the heart and what we think andfeel are the same because they come together and know. When they do, it isArmistice Day for the soul; the war is over. The inner peace becomes outer peacebecause the two are but one. The conflict in the world ‘outside’ is only amirror of the war within us all. If we make peace with ourselves, we make peacewith life itself, for we are life itself. When we do this, the Illuminati willbe no more because they will be erased from our sense of reality every bit asmuch as the man who could not see his daughter. The Illuminati are alsoillusions of our minds, as is the brain that they seek to program. Even ourminds beyond the brain are illusions. So is the heart chakra, albeit a higherlevel one. It is but a stepping stone to true, all-embracing Oneness, wherethere is no heart or soul or head; only the balance of everything, the AllKnowing, which simply ‘is’. An illusion (mind) is creating an illusion(reality). The Oneness of all is the only truth, everything else is illusion.The mystic, Sri Aurobindo Ghose, brilliantly described the antidote to all this:> “We must not only cut asunder the snare of the mind and the senses, but flee> also from the snare of the thinker, the snare of the theologian and the> church-builder, the meshes of the Word and the bondage of the Idea. All these> are within us waiting to wall in the spirit with form; but we must always go> beyond, always renounce the lesser for the greater, the finite for the> Infinite; we must be prepared to proceed from illumination to illumination,> from experience to experience, from soul state to soul state … Nor must we> attach ourselves even to the truth we hold most securely, for they are but> forms and expressions of the Ineffable who refuses to limit itself to any form> or expression.” 3 We are not our bodies. We are not our brains. We are not our minds. We are noteven our thoughts. We are the silence, the stillness, between them. Even as wethink we are purveyors of illusion. We live in a world that is designed to beneither silent nor still. There are keepers at every gate to the One. We arekept busy, busy, busy, to maintain the chatter of mind. The development ofcities concentrates people and stress, movement and noise. Where is the silent?Where is the still? They are within us and that is where we must go toexperience the One. It is worth making space every day to calm the mind and gointo the silence and stillness where knowing is waiting to communicate. SriAurobindo said: “To discover the new country within us, we have to leave the oldone behind.” Meditation is one way of achieving this, although I prefer to callit sitting quietly. There is a lot of junk talked about meditation and thismethod or that. I have met many meditation addicts who are no more enlightenedthan those who never do it. I have met a lot of psychoactive drug junkies in asimilar state. It is not the meditation or the drugs; it is where you allow themto take you or, more to the point, where you allow you to take yourself. Sittingquietly, for me anyway, is to surrender to your heart and allow it to take youhome. If you have never done this, it can be frustrating trying to stop thechatterbox in the head. So don’t try. By doing so you are giving it powerthrough attention. Don’t try to do anything, just be. This removes the powerfrom the mind and with repetition you will find that the chatter will subsideand you can go into timeless, Oneness states, where there are no questions, noreven words; there is only knowing, being. It is like taking a deep breath,stepping back and looking at life from another perspective. What you believed tobe so important becomes ever more irrelevant as the divisions melt away andunity is all that remains.Within the realm of illusion, visualisation is concentrated thought (like“prayer”) and thought creates holographic reality. Visualising what you want tocreate in holographic experience can be extremely effective in the manifestationof what you desire. Through this we can experience whatever we choose – pleasantor unpleasant, a nightmare or our wildest dream. Our beliefs decide theexperience. A television psychic from my childhood used to say: “Think lucky andyou’ll be lucky.” But it is nothing to do with luck; it is manifestation ofreality by sense of reality. If we know we are Oneness and the rest is illusion,we can enjoy the holographic ‘world’ and have fun with it. We can experience allthat is available to us – anything. Life is not an “either or”, it is an “aswell as”. Our limitations are only our sense of limitation. Illusion can onlycontrol us when we think it is real, just as a magician cannot fool us when weknow how he does it. From the knowledge of Oneness and the manifestation of‘reality’ through thought, we can create an illusion that we like in the fullknowledge that this is what we are doing. By freeing the mind of fear, doubt anda sense of limitation, we can live in an illusory paradise in the knowledge thatwe are paradise – the One.Love thy “enemy”?People have said that they can’t understand why I say we must love those thatseek to control us and perpetuate human suffering. But love is Oneness and solove is the balance of all things. Hatred comes from the illusion of division.Hate is not the other polarity of love because love is Oneness and Oneness hasno polarities. If we hate those who cause the mayhem we are holding ourselves inthe illusion and, therefore, the control of those we hate. This is yet anotherloop. The manipulators are full of hate and fear; so do we want to join them??To love someone is not to stand by and let them impose their will upon you orothers. Love stands up for what it believes to be right no matter what thechallenge or intimidation. It is possible to expose what is going on and changethat reality without hating those involved. It is essential to do this because,otherwise, we are the same as that which we claim to dislike. We see this allthe time when we delude ourselves into believing that the methods we condemn,when used by others, can be justified for us to employ because we are trying todo “good”. You do not achieve what you believe to be right by doing what youknow to be wrong. Friedrich Nietzsche put it like this:> “He who fights with monsters might take care, lest he thereby become a> monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into> you.” How often do we see those who challenge “evil” turn into a mirror of those theycondemn? Look at the political Left and Right as one prime example. The far Lefthates the far Right and vice versa. Yet they are the same in both thought andmethod. Hatred, resentment and a need for revenge are cancers of the soul. Whenwe feel these emotions, who are the victims? We are. The targets might be havinga great time, unaware of how we feel about them, while we cook in our own stewof seething fury at the expense of joy and happiness. Hatred and resentment are,with fear, the ultimate in self abuse. It’s time to let them go and see them forthe illusions that they are. We don’t need to fight the Illuminati, but changethe reality in which they exist. Scientist and philosopher Buckminster Fullersaid: “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To changesomething, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”Wise monkeysIn the years since that mound in Peru, I have seen the awakening of the humanheart gathering in both numbers and power. The transformation I was told aboutin 1990 is coming to pass, even as the forces of control also appear to beincreasing their power. But this is, in fact, the final card of a gambler whoforgot the golden rule: don’t play with those who know more than you do. TheIlluminati plays Oneness = four threes plays a full house. The awakening ischallenging the domination of Illuminati reality in the collective unconscious –consensus reality. The ‘hundred monkeys’ are posting their realisations on thehuman ‘Worldwide Web’ and there they can be accessed by anyone attuning to thatawareness. This is happening at an ever quickening pace. It can be seen in themillions on the streets in protest at the invasion of Iraq – many of whom hadnever done anything like that before. It can be seen in their articulatedunderstanding that those in authority are pedalling lies to sell a secret agendato the people. It can be seen in the empathy with those of other skins and othercultures who face the violence of the so-called civilised world. The hundredthmonkey syndrome means that people are spontaneously awakening with a knowingthat something is seriously not right with the direction they are being taken.Now is the moment to push on. We need to become even more vocal with thisknowledge and consciously connect with the Infinite knowing, Infinite Love, thatwill dismantle the freeze vibration of ‘solidified’ ignorance. Those who knowabout the suppression and manipulation in science, politics, the media and allthe other vehicles for control need to speak out and expand the understanding ofthe people for what is unfolding. If you know something, say so. The fear ofdoing this will not even register compared with the consequences for you andyour children of looking the other way. Come on, let’s go.Live, love, laugh and be happyThis is such an exciting moment to be here in the five-sense illusion. We arewitnessing and manifesting a transformation of reality that will change ourconscious experience on a scale that will beggar belief. Oneness put the kettleon – we’re coming home. But then, we never left; we just deluded ourselves thatwe had. Laughter is so important in all this. The voice that speaks to me isfull of fun and laughter and having experienced where it comes from, I am notsurprised. There are no tears in ‘heaven’; no pain in the One. And, anyway,isn’t it all such a bloody hoot? What can we do, but laugh? On the second nightof ayahuasca in Brazil, I could hardly stop laughing at what the voice wassaying. For hours Pam and I were in hysterics as the voice told me about thenature of human reality. It is so hilarious. Here we are running around a TimeLoop like a mouse in a wheel, believing in ‘time’ that doesn’t exist. Thequicker we ‘move’ ‘forward’, the quicker we ‘go’ ‘back’, when, in truth, wenever go anywhere. What a laugh. Our bodies only ‘die’ because we think they do.We only feel pain and suffer illness because we think we do. We only grow oldbecause we think we do. We bang our heads against a solid wall that cannot besolid; we bang our toe on a table when the table is an illusion and so is thetoe. We fear the future when there is none. We regret the past when there isnone. We fear the unknown when we are the All-Knowing. In the words of a Chinesesaying: “Finally, at the end when everything is finished and all questionsanswered, there is nothing left to do but sit down and have a good laugh.”> Ha, ha, ha, heh, heh, heh, heh, whoop, whoop, whoop, ha, ha, ha, heh, heh,> heh, whoop, whoop, whoop.

We cannot ‘die’ and we are whatever wechoose to be for all eternity. Whatever happens we make happen and have theinfinite power to change. My daughter, Kerry, would not think of herself as aphilosopher, but she is and she lives her life by manifesting what she needswhenever she needs it. One of her gems is: “It’s all good and if it’s not itwill be because it always is in the end.” Perfect.Infinite love is the only truth; everything else is illusion.Nuff said.

The government and ‘legal’ system of the United States is controlled by the‘Crown’. As explained in chapter two[../Text/index_split_016.html#filepos136522], the Crown is not the Britishmonarch as widely believed, but the ‘City’, an independent state in London. Inturn, the ‘City’ or the ‘Crown’ is really the Knights Templar Church, also knownas the Crown Temple or Crown Templar, and this is located between Fleet Streetand Victoria Embankment. The Temple grounds are also home to the Crown Officesat Crown Office Row.The Crown Temple controls the global ‘legal’ system, including those in theUnited States and Canada, because all Bar Associations are franchises of theInternational Bar Association at the Inns of Court at Crown Temple based atChancery Lane in London. All Bar Associations are franchises of the Crown andall Bar Attorneys throughout the world pledge a solemn oath to the Temple, eventhough some may not be aware that this is what they are doing. Bar Association‘licensed’ attorneys must keep to their oath, pledge and terms of allegiance tothe Crown Temple if they are to be ‘called to the Bar’ and work in the ‘legal’profession. The ‘ruling’ monarch is also subordinate to the Crown Temple and hasbeen so since the reign of King John in the 13th century when royal sovereigntywas transferred to the Crown Temple and, through that, to the Roman Church. KingJohn (1167-1216) is a key to this story. It was at the Chancel, or Chancery, ofthe Crown Inner Temple Court in January 1215 that King John was faced with thedemands of the English barons to confirm the rights enshrined in the MagnaCarta. When he signed the Magna Carta in 1215, history records this as an eventthat extended human freedom, but the real affect was very different as we shallsee. The ‘governments’ of the United States and Canada are other subsidiaries ofthe Crown Temple and so is the US ‘central bank’, the Federal Reserve. Indeedthe global banking system is controlled by the Crown Temple as well as the‘legal’ system.Bar Associations are awarded their franchises by the four Inns of Court at theTemple. These are the Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Lincoln’s Inn and Gray’s Innand they are nothing less than exclusive secret societies without charters orstatutes. They are a law unto themselves. The Inner Temple controls the legalsystem franchise for Canada and Britain while the Middle Temple does the samefor the United States. Queen Elizabeth II is a member of both temples. I haveexplained earlier in the book that the Illuminati always seek to control both‘sides’ in any situation. Thus at least five signatories to the AmericanDeclaration of Independence were Temple Attorneys who had pledged allegiance tothe Crown! Another Middle Temple agent during the formation of the United Stateswas Alexander Hamilton who structured the American banking system in line withthe Crown Temple agenda for control of the new United States (a ‘State’ is alegal entity of the Crown – a Crown Colony!). As Michael Edward points out in anexcellent Internet study:> “Americans were fooled into believing that the legal Crown Colonies comprising> New England were independent nation states, but they never were nor are today.> They were and still are Colonies of the Crown Temple, through letters patent> and charters, who have no legal authority to be independent from the Rule and> Order of the Crown Temple. A legal State is a Crown Temple Colony. > “Neither the American people nor the Queen of Britain own America. The Crown> Temple owns America through the deception of those who have sworn their> allegiance by oath to the Middle Templar Bar. The Crown Bankers and their> Middle Templar Attorneys rule America through unlawful contracts, unlawful> taxes, and contract documents of false equity through debt deceit, all> strictly enforced by their completely unlawful, but ‘legal’, Orders, Rules and> Codes of the Crown Temple Courts, our so-called ‘judiciary’ in America. This> is because the Crown Temple holds the land titles and estate deeds to all of> North America.” 1 Seven Middle Inn Templars who had pledged an oath of allegiance to the CrownTemple (including Alexander Hamilton) were among the members of theConstitutional Convention who signed the completed ‘American Constitution’. Howsymbolic it is that copies of the American Constitution and the Declaration ofIndependence hang on the wall of the library of the Middle Temple in London.After all, they were the force behind both of them. While Middle Bar Templarswere orchestrating the illusion of freedom from the perceived rule by KingGeorge III, the king, too, was a sworn member of the same Middle Temple. MichaelEdward continues:> “1776 is the year that will truly live in infamy for all Americans. It is the> year that the Crown Colonies became legal Crown States. The Declaration of> Independence was a legal, not lawful, document. It was signed on both sides by> representatives of the Crown Temple. Legally, it announced the status quo of> the Crown Colonies to that of the new legal name called ‘States’ as direct> possessive estates of the Crown. > “The American people were hoodwinked into thinking they were declaring lawful> independence from the Crown. Proof that the Colonies are still in Crown> possession is the use of the word ‘State’ to signify a ‘legal estate of> possession.’ Had this been a document of and by the people, both the> Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution would have been written> using the word ‘states’. By the use of ‘State’, the significance of a> government of estate possession was legally established. All of the North> American States are Crown Templar possessions through their legal document,> signed by their representation of both parties to the contract, known as the> Constitution of the United States of America.” 2 Britain and Ireland are owned by the Roman ChurchSo the United States, together with Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland, arecontrolled by the Knights Templar ‘Crown’, but who owns the Knights Templar‘Crown’? Well, er, the Pope, or rather the Illuminati that controls him. On May15th 1213, our old friend King John, who was a puppet of the Templars,effectively signed away the Kingdom of England and Ireland to Pope Innocent IIIand the Roman Church, witnessed by the Crown Templars. As King John said at thetime: “I myself bearing witness in the house of the Knights Templars.” The KingJohn charter stated:> “We wish it to be known to all of you, through this our charter, furnished> with our seal … not induced by force or compelled by fear, but of our own good> and spontaneous will and by the common counsel of our barons, do offer and> freely concede to God and His holy apostles Peter and Paul and to our mother> the holy Roman church, and to our lord pope Innocent and to his Catholic> successors, the whole kingdom of England and the whole kingdom Ireland, with> all their rights and appurtenances … we perform and swear fealty for them to> him our aforesaid lord pope Innocent, and his Catholic successors and the> Roman church … binding our successors and our heirs by our wife forever, in> similar manner to perform fealty and show homage to him who shall be chief> pontiff at that time, and to the Roman church without demur. As a sign … we> will and establish perpetual obligation and concession … from the proper and> especial revenues of our aforesaid kingdoms … the Roman church shall receive> yearly a thousand marks sterling … saving to us and to our heirs our rights,> liberties and regalia; all of which things, as they have been described above,> we wish to have perpetually valid and firm; and we bind ourselves and our> successors not to act counter to them. And if we or any one of our successors> shall presume to attempt this, whoever he be, unless being duly warned he come> to his kingdom, and his senses, he shall lose his right to the kingdom, and> this charter of our obligation and concession shall always remain firm.” Historical accounts concentrate on the fact that this charter obligated theCrown to pay money to the Roman Church, but it also states that if the terms ofthis charter are broken, the ‘right to the Kingdom’ shall be lost. When KingJohn signed the Magna Carta on June 15th 1215 he broke the terms of the charterwith the Pope and therefore lost the right to his kingdom. Pope Innocent IIIthen declared the Magna Carter null and void. From this time the ‘Crown’ passedfrom the monarch to the Knights Templar who, to this day, govern Britain onbehalf of the Roman (Illuminati) Church. This means, if we take it a stagefurther, that ultimately, through the Crown Temple, the Roman Church also ownsthe United States, Canada and all countries and Bar Associations controlled(overtly or covertly) by the Crown! This is why the Peace Treaty between theAmerican Colonies and the British Crown in 1783, stated:> “It having pleased the Divine Providence to dispose the hearts of the most> serene and most potent Prince George the Third, by the grace of God, king of> Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, duke of Brunswick> and Lunebourg, arch-treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire> etc., and of the United States of America …” (My emphasis) How ironic that a Roman Catholic is barred from being the British monarch whileall along the monarch and the ‘kingdom’ have been owned by the Roman Church.And the Roman Church is … the Church of Babylon.SOURCES > 1“The Crown Temple, By Rule of Mystery Babylon”, ecclesia.org/forum/uploads/> Bondservant/The%20Crown%20Temple.doc You will find excellent background> information at this site.> 2Ibid"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX II The poor bloody infantry By David IckeOh hello lad,Nice of you to come,To fight for king and country,You are a hero, son.Now let’s have a look at you,Just say “ahhh” and cough,Yes, that’s fine,I’ll sign the form,You’re ready for the off.(In fact he’s got a problem,Something not quite right,But I have to close my eyes to that,We have a war to fight.I have to say that he can go,Even when there’s doubt,I have to send them down the line,Get them kitted out.)So off they go to Normandy,Verdun or the Somme,Bits of kids and fathers,Fodder for a bomb.And fodder for the generals,With their master plans,The educated idiots,With blood upon their hands.Wham! Bang! Wham! Bang! Bang!Bloody hell, hit the ground.Screech! Capow!Their bodies never found.Each a grim statistic,Each a telegram.Your loved one killed in action.He was a hero, ma’am.And by way of compensationWe have a pension here for you,To help you bring the kids up,To help to see you through.(We don’t tell her it’s a pittance,That she’ll never see her husband’s grave.That he’s no longer any use to usWhen we have the world to save.)And what of the survivors,With broken body,Broken mind?When they come home from battle,What justice do they find?Right, move along now,I have so much to do,I have a lot to see today,Can’t spend much time with you.Now you say you’ve been acting funny,Since you came back home from war.That every time you close your eyes,You re-live the hell you saw.You say you seem to cry a lot,That you’ve tried to take your life,You say you’re unemployable,Depend upon your wife.Well I have to say I’m sorry,The answer must be no.We can’t pay you compensation,I can’t bend the rules you know.It’s clear you have a problem.You may even be insane.But you cannot prove to me,It was caused at Alamein.But it’s no good you complaining,We all made a sacrificeYou’ll try to make the best of it,If you ask for my adviceIt could have been much worse, you knowAfter all we won.Like I told you years ago,You are a hero, son."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX III Because We Are Jews By Rabbi Mordechi Weberman There are those who ask us why we march with the Palestinians. Why do we raisethe Palestinian flag? Why do we support the Palestinian cause?“You are Jews!” they tell us. “What are you doing?”And our response is very simple:It is precisely because we are Jews that we march with the Palestinians andraise their flag!It is precisely because we are Jews that we demand that the Palestinian peoplesbe returned to their homes and properties!Yes, in our Torah we are commanded to be fair. We are called upon to pursuejustice. And, what could be more unjust than the century-old attempt of theZionist movement to invade another people’s land, to drive them out and stealtheir property?The early Zionists proclaimed that they were a people without a land going to aland without a people.Innocent sounding words.But utterly and totally untrue.Palestine was a land with a people. A people that were developing a nationalconsciousness.We have no doubt that would Jewish refugees have come to Palestine not with theintention of dominating, not with the intention of making a Jewish state, notwith the intention of dispossessing, not with the intention of depriving thePalestinians of their basic rights, that they would have been welcomed by thePalestinians, with the same hospitality that Islamic peoples have shown Jewsthroughout history. And we would have lived together as Jews and Muslims livedbefore in Palestine in peace and harmony.To our Islamic and Palestinian friends around the world, please hear our message—There are Jews around the world who support your cause. And when we support yourcause we do not mean some partition scheme proposed in 1947 by a UN that had noright to offer it.When we say support your cause we do not mean the cut off and cut up pieces ofthe West Bank offered by Barak at Camp David together with justice for less than10 % of the refugees.We do not mean anything other than returning the entire land, includingJerusalem, to Palestinian sovereignty!At that point justice demands that the Palestinian people should decide if andhow many Jews should remain in the Land.This is the only path to true reconciliation.But we demand yet more. WE demand that in returning the land back to itsrightful owners we have not yet done enough. There should be an apology to thePalestinian people which is clear and precise. Zionism did you wrong. Zionismstole your homes. Zionism stole your land.By so proclaiming we proclaim before the world that we are the people of theTorah, that our faith demands that we be honest and fair and good and kind.We have attended hundreds of pro-Palestinian rallies over the years andeverywhere we go the leaders and audience greet us with the warmth of MiddleEastern hospitality. What a lie it is to say that Palestinians in particular orMuslims in general hate Jews. You hate injustice. Not Jews.Fear not my friends. Evil cannot long triumph. The Zionist nightmare is at itsend. It is exhausted. Its latest brutalities are the death rattle of theterminally ill.We will yet both live to see the day when Jew and Palestinian will embrace inpeace under the Palestinian flag in Jerusalem.And ultimately when mankind’s Redeemer will come the sufferings of the presentwill long be forgotten in the blessings of the future.Source: http://www.marchforjustice.com/Becausewearejews.php[http://www.marchforjustice.com/Becausewearejews.php] "},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY > Alpert, Richard: Be Here Now (Lama Foundation, San Cristobal, New Mexico,> 1971)> Baron, S.W.: A Social and Religious History of the Jews (New York, 1957)> Bathhurst Deane, Reverend John: The Worship of the Serpent (J.G. and F.> Rivington, London, 1833)> Beard, Henry and Cerf, Christopher: Official Politically Correct Dictionary> and Handbook (Random House, 1993)> Bentov, Itzhak: Stalking the Wild Pendulum (Destiny Books, Vermont, 1988)> Boulay, R.A.: Flying Serpents and Dragons, The Story of Mankind’s Reptilian> Past, new revised edition (The Book Tree, PO Box 724, Escondido, California)> Castaneda, Carlos: Tales of Power (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1974)> Childress, David Hatcher: Ancient Indian Aircraft Technology> (http://www.farshore.force9.co.uk/india.htm> [http://www.farshore.force9.co.uk/india.htm])> Chomsky, Noam: Fateful Triangle (South End Press, 1999)> Churchward, Colonel James: The Children of Mu (Available through the David> Icke website)> Conforto, Giuliana: Man’s Cosmic Game, (Edizioni Noesis 1998) and Giordano> Bruno’s Future Science (Edizioni Noesis 2000).> Desborough, Brian: They Cast No Shadows (Writers Club Press, USA, 2002)> Dole, George F: An Image of God in a Mirror, Emanuel Swedenborg: A Continuing> Vision (Swedenborg Foundation, New York, 1988)> Doreal, Maurice: The Emerald Tablets Of Thoth-The-Atlantean (Source Books,> Nashville, Tennessee)> Dugger, Ronnie: The Politician: The Life and Times of Lyndon Johnson (Norton,> 1982) Einstein, Albert: The Meaning of Relativity (Princeton University Press> 1972)> Eisenberg, David, with Thomas Lee Wright: Encounters with Qi(Penguin, New> York, 1987)> Ellis, Ralph: Thoth, Architect of the Universe (1997); Jesus, Last of the> Pharaohs (1998); Tempest and Exodus (2000); K2, Quest of the Gods (2000);> Solomon, Falcon of Sheba (2002).
