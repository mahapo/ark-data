Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions,> their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation> Oscar Wilde In 1990, I consciously began an incredible journey of self-discovery. I had noidea where it would lead, but I was going anyway. I’d had enough. This ‘world’had never made sense to me: the injustice, the stupidity, the way the systemturns people into little more than machines working through a spin cycle ofrepeating experience and behaviour they hysterically call ‘life’. We don’t livelife – life lives us.There are exceptions and many will be reading this book, but most people aretold what to think, where to go, what to do and how to do it. Not so? Well,where do you get your ‘information’ that leads you to reach conclusions aboutyourself and the world? Who decides what time you get up every workday? Whodecides where you go and what you do when you get there? Who decides how you doit? If you are like the overwhelming majority of people currently resident inthis dreamworld, those decisions are not made by you at all; they are imposed bythe ‘system’, the spider’s web of control that dictates its will upon your‘life’.You get your ‘information’ from the mainstream media that sells you the dailyfalsehoods on which you decide what to think and believe. You have to get up ata certain time because you have to report for work and you can’t be late. You gowhere your bosses tell you to go and you do what they say. If you rebel you getfired and if you don’t get paid you can’t afford a home or enough to eat. Andit’s not only you. What about your family and others dependent upon you? If youdon’t serve the system what are the consequences for them? To meet all theseperceived needs and responsibilities, you have to spend every day keeping otherpeople happy. In turn, the bosses are also slavishly following the impositionsof those who control them and they dare not step out of line either. Bosses havebosses, too.Take a farmer supplying food to a supermarket; he dictates to his farmworkersand if they don’t do as he tells them they’re sacked. But he also has to dowhatever the supermarket tells him or he loses the contract and can go out ofbusiness. At the next level, those running the supermarket have to answer toshareholders, who will themselves include people who serve their bosses, andbosses who serve their own bosses. Round and round it goes, this circle ofdependency and imposition of will. One man’s slave is another man’s master; oneman’s sheep is another man’s shepherd. This is the way the world is purposelystructured. The system wants everyone controlling everyone else and this is donein a billion different ways. What we call ‘free societies’ are Gulags by anyother name. The system doesn’t serve us – we serve it. We are slaves who deludeourselves that we are free because we don’t want to face the reality of ourplight.I was on an American radio show one night when a caller made a great point. Helikened humanity to the husband who knows his wife is being unfaithful, but isdesperately trying to persuade himself it’s not true. When she comes home heconfronts her about where she’s been and who she’s been with. The husband knowsthe truth, but he is desperately hoping that his wife’s explanation soundscredible enough for him to go on kidding himself that everything is fine. He’drather hear a good lie than accept an unpleasant truth. In the same way, mostpeople don’t want to face the conspiracy and corruption of governments or askwhy the countries go to war against defenceless civilians, including their own.When governments deliver the lies and excuses for their grotesque actions mostpeople are ready to accept them because they want to believe the lies are true.The alternative is to face the fact that the government is not a benign servantof the people – it’s the other way round. It is to face the reality that theforces which control the United States are capable of orchestrating the horrorsof 9/11 and blaming someone else; and that they can brazenly attend funeralservices for the victims while knowing they helped to kill them. How many peopleare strong enough to face that and what it means for their lives? This is onemajor reason why the official lies prevail as accepted truth. The alternative istoo unthinkable, too unbearable, to contemplate; so most people don’t. Pass me abucket, heavy on the sand.The same is true of the collective denial we have about our lives: ‘I’ve got abig house and a big car; ain’t life great?’ Well, the house and the car may begreat, but life? How many people are doing what they really want to do? How manyare truly happy, fulfilled and at peace with themselves? Hardly any, in truth.Isn’t that in itself a profound condemnation of the insanity we call ‘life’?Most people do what they think they have to do and that means serving the systemon the system’s terms. Why do we confuse ‘life’ with the world as it iscurrently experienced? What has life got to do with blowing up children in frontof their parents and parents in front of their children and calling it‘liberation’? Where is the life in getting up at the same time every morning tosit in the same jam, or queue for the same train, on the way to the same jobthat leaves you bored, frustrated and unfulfilled, before returning through thesame jam, or same queue, to watch the same nightly TV that treats you like amoron? Where is the life in sending our children to schools and universitiesdesigned to spit them out as the programmed cogs of the next generation? But,again, we’d rather convince ourselves that we have a ‘good job’, ‘good career’,‘good life’, and give our children a ‘good education’, than face the horror ofhorrors that life is actually shit. Or shit compared with what it could be andwe would like it to be. Indeed, it’s not ‘life’ at all. It is a veil of tearsdisguised with heavy mascara and massive dabs of self-delusion.We judge our ‘happiness’ by our state of unhappiness, and our achievements bythe symbols and trinkets that the system has decreed are the essentials of‘success’. On the day I was writing this I saw the results of a study about themental and emotional health of teenagers in Britain, although the same willapply across the industrialised, computerised, world and beyond. The study:‘Time Trends in Adolescent Mental Health’, published in the Journal of ChildPsychology and Psychiatry, revealed that the number of 15-year-olds sufferingfrom anxiety and depression had increased by 70 per cent in less than 20 years.Hey, we are talking 15-year-olds! The study concluded that a key cause of thisdramatic increase in teenage emotional trauma was the pressure to ‘succeed’. Itshould have added, more accurately, to succeed on the system’s terms. The studysaid the ‘pressures of succeeding academically and the prospect of debt arecontributing to widespread unhappiness’.In Britain, thanks to the Blair government, students face a mountain of debtwhen they leave university because of the loans they have had to take out to payfor their education (or what passes for it). Debt means control by the systemand that’s the real reason for student loans. The study also pointed out theimbalance in time spent at school compared with leisure activities, something Ihave been highlighting for years. They keep the kids at school for hours on endfive days a week and when the prison door opens they send them off withhomework! When do children and young people have time to do what they want todo? Answer: in between the deluge of academic bullshit designed to turn out themind-fodder that keeps the system rolling on like some runaway snowball,gathering more and more of our freedoms and uniqueness in its daily wake.Another study: The Growing Pains Survey, reported by the UK Press Association inOctober 2004, confirmed these trends with three quarters of parents interviewedsaying their children were under far more pressure than they had been at thesame age. A similar percentage said that peer pressure and stresses at school(such as bullying and exams) had the greatest impact on their child’s emotionalhealth and well-being. And exams for what, pray? To reveal the extent to whichthe system controls their minds and perception. According to the survey, sevenout of ten parents said the government should be investing more in the provisionof mental health services for children and young people. Oh my God, get me outof here! Never mind ‘treating’ the problem, how about removing the cause? Howabout changing the way your children feel by telling them to relax and have funbecause education and passing the system’s exams is a pile of crap? ‘Education’is there to program, indoctrinate and implant a collective belief in a realitythat suits the power structure. It is about subordination, limitation, and the‘I can’t’, ‘you can’t’, mentality because that’s what the system wants everyoneto express in their journey to the grave or the hot box. What we call Educationdoesn’t open minds, it screws down the lid. As Albert Einstein put it: ‘The onlything that interferes with my learning is my education’. He also said thateducation is ‘what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned inschool’.Why does it make parents proud to see their children getting certificates of‘achievement’ for telling the system what it demands to hear? I’m not sayingpeople shouldn’t pursue knowledge but, if we are talking freedom here, that hasto be done on our terms, not the system’s. It is also sobering to note thatpoliticians, government officials, journalists, scientists, doctors, lawyers,judges, business leaders and others who administer or serve the system, areinvariably those who have been through the same university (indoctrination)mind-machine. Sadly, intelligence and passing exams are so often believed to bethe same thing. I was in a disco one night where the dance floor was emptybecause the DJ was playing music the people didn’t want to hear. This ego fromhell refused to change it and I asked if that was very intelligent in thecircumstances. He was outraged at such a suggestion. He had proof that he wasintelligent – he had a degree! Hilarious. Basic intelligence is to see thatpeople aren’t dancing because the music is shite and to change it for somethingthey like; a degree is to tell the system what it has told you to tell it. Whatis intelligent about that?Most people kid themselves that they are free by never testing the theory forreal. They are like flies caught in a web and so long as they don’t try to movethey can convince themselves that they could if they wanted to. It’s just thatthey don’t want to right now, you see (Figure 1). If they tried they would haveto face the fact that their arse is superglued to someone else’s control systemwith dinner about to be served – them. They keep doing what the governmentdictatorships tell them to do, without question or challenge, and perpetuate theillusion that they have free choice by never making one. ‘Having my wings stuckto this web suits me fine because I am choosing not to fly.’ I have met so manypeople over the years who thought they were free until they did something thatwas outside the ‘norm’. A big reality check followed because, to quote thatgreat American comedian, Bill Hicks: ‘You are free to do as we tell you’. As theOrwellian global state emerges rapidly from the shadows, this self-deceptionabout a ‘free world’ is becoming far more difficult to sustain. But instead ofstaring their plight in the face, most just try harder to look the other way.Most people are quick to complain about what is happening in their lives and thewider world, yet they are cast in stone when it comes to doing anything aboutit. Far better, it seems, to avoid your own responsibility by blaming someoneelse. The world is like it is because we have allowed the few to make it thatway and just pointing the finger at those few is not enough. We are all involvedin this. Voltaire captured this theme brilliantly when he said: ‘No snowflake inan avalanche ever felt responsible’.From the time I was seven or eight this ‘world’ seemed crazy to me and when Ibegan to see what lay behind the illusion we call ‘reality’, I was an open door.There was no need to push; I was already swinging. There had to be a reason whythe world was so ludicrous and why so few appeared able to see it or, at least,admit it to themselves. My incredible experiences since 1990 have shown me thatthere is indeed a reason, a method in the madness. Society is like it is becausethose in control want it to be this way. It suits their agenda for globaldictatorship. The extraordinary story behind the façade of daily life has beenunfolded to me step by step and this book represents the next one – a giganticleap into a realm and reality where few are prepared to go.image [../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 1:‘Fancy going out today, Bill?’‘No thanks, mate, I‘m happy sitting here’.‘But we could go out if we wanted to, couldn’t we?’‘Sure we could’.‘That’s okay, then – ain’t it great to be free?’I explain how my journey began in Tales from the Time Loop but, in summary, Iwas told through a psychic that I would be given the ‘spiritual riches’ to, ineffect, lift the veil of illusion that held humanity in servitude. Knowledgewould be put into my mind and at other times I would be led to knowledge, thepsychic told me. ‘One man cannot change the world, but one man can communicatethe message that will change the world’, she said. Many other psychics repeatedthe same themes. There were secrets to be revealed – enormous secrets – and Iwould be led to this knowledge and communicate it on a global scale. One said:‘Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only haveto follow the clues’. It sounded fantastic at the time, but how true it provedto be. From that point on, my life became an explosion of synchronicity and‘coincidence’. I have been led to knowledge through people, books and personalexperience in more than 40 countries and the clues have been laid out, not onlyin abundance, but in the right order to most swiftly assimilate. I have beenguided along a path that began with an understanding of the manipulation in this‘world’, the reality we think is ‘physical’, and then took me into other realmsthat interpenetrate this one – what scientists call parallel universes. In thefirst two chapters I am going to summarise this information before moving to thenext amazing stage in the unfolding revelation of who we are, where we are, andwhat we are doing here.image [../Images/00007.jpg]Figure 2: The Illuminati global fascist state. The plan is for a worldgovernment dictatorship that includes a second tier of superstates like theEuropean Union. What we now call ‘countries’ would be merely administrativesubsidiaries controlled by the world government, central bank and army. Thisstructure would allow a few to impose their will on the global populationThrough the 1990s, thanks to unseen guidance and synchronised ‘coincidence’, Ibegan to understand and communicate the ‘five-sense’ level of a globalconspiracy for human control orchestrated through a network of secret societiesand interbreeding families known as the Illuminati. These are the families thatcontrol governments, the banking system, transnational corporations, oil andpharmaceutical cartels, world media, intelligence agencies, police forces andeven what is taught in the schools and universities. All these aspects ofsociety, and so many more, are ultimately controlled by the same Illuminatifamilies pursuing the same agenda of global tyranny. Their aim is a centralisedfascist state headed by a world government, central bank, currency, and armythat will enslave a microchipped population connected to, and controlled by, aglobal computer network (Figure 2). People laughed when I first suggested thatthis was the plan, but only the uninformed and concrete-minded are smirking now.The Orwellian ‘Big Brother’ nightmare unfurls by the day, especially since 9/11.This is not surprising when you realise that those attacks were engineered bythe same force that now uses them as an excuse to impose its fascist agenda to‘save us’ from terrorism (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade CenterDisaster). We can clearly see the rapidly advancing centralisation of power andownership in all areas of our lives and it has become known as globalisation.This is not just about big, greedy corporations, as so many of the ‘Left’ wouldhave us believe. The major corporations are not the end, but a means to the end.They are part of a coordinated and long-planned agenda for global control whichtargets every expression of human existence.In politics we have superstates like the European Union, and its emergingmirrors: the African Union, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and theplanned ‘Free Trade’ Area of the Americas (FTAA). These are structured to alignwith a basic fact of life for would-be dictatorships – the more you centralisedecision-making the more power the few have over the many. Diversity is theworst nightmare of the dictator because he can’t control all the points ofdecision-making. Uniformity and centralisation are essential to Fascism orCommunism or whatever name you give to your dictatorship of choice. Thus, we seethe centralisation of everything introduced with an ever-gathering pace.The world government is designed to be the capstone on this pyramid of politicaltyranny and the world army’s role is to impose its decisions on countries thatwant to govern themselves. It is for this reason that national armies are moreand more subordinate to, and merely a part of, groupings like NATO and theUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. It is an example of what I call the‘Totalitarian Tiptoe’ in which you go step by step to a long-decided goalinstead of making colossal changes all at once. If the steps are too big manypeople would see what was going on and that’s not the idea. Our ignorance istheir bliss. In Europe, the EEC, or Common Market ‘free trade’ area, became thecentralised fascist state known as the European Union thanks to the drip, drip,drip of change imposed through the Totalitarian Tiptoe, and the same ishappening elsewhere.The Illuminati manipulate their placemen and women into the key positions inpolitics, and most of the rest who make up the political numbers are ignorantfodder. Intelligence never was an essential attribute of a politician and oftenit is a bad career move. Tim Collins, a Conservative Member of Parliament in theUK, was sent details by a constituent about flaws in the official story of the‘plane’ that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon on 9/11. Mr Collins wasoffered the chance to see a DVD presentation detailing this evidence, but herefused to even look at it. His ‘executive assistant’ wrote that Mr Collins ‘…does not believe in conspiracy theories, and regards it as particularlyreprehensible that the creators of the DVD to which you refer should be seekingto play games with such a terrible tragedy’. This was without even bothering tosee it, and the fact that people like Tim Collins become politicians might alsobe considered a terrible tragedy for those they are supposed to represent. Whenyou have Members of Parliament or Congress with this mentality – and Collins isa norm, not a rarity – manipulating the political system is child’s play.Politics always reminds me of Albert Einstein’s adage that you can’t solveproblems with the same level of intelligence that created them.The Pyramid of Manipulationimage [../Images/00008.jpg]All the major institutions and groups that affect our daily lives connect withthe Illuminati, which decides the coordinated policy throughout the pyramid.People in the lower compartments will have no idea what they are part of.Figure 3: The Russian doll dictatorship. Global society is structured aspyramids within bigger pyramids with one encompassing them all. At the top arethe Illuminati families manipulating their agenda for global control throughapparently unconnected organisations and institutions. ‘Free societies’ are amyth because the Hidden Hand is imposing its agenda behind this veil of deceitThe control of banking and business is already in a few hands and the trendcontinues. The European currency – the euro – is part of the Illuminati agendato replace all currencies with a single world currency controlled by the plannedWorld Central Bank. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the (Illuminati)banking dynasty, is reported to have said: ‘Give me control of a nation’scurrency and I care not who makes the laws’. Take that a stage further and youhave the plan for a world dictatorship in which they control the world currencyand make the laws. The Illuminati families use their secret society network andinterlocking, proxy, gofer directors to control all the major banks andtransnational corporations. There may appear to be different names on the majorboards of directors, but they are answerable to the masters who put them thereand dictate the policy they pursue. As detailed in my other books, the world iscontrolled on the five-sense level by a structure of pyramids within pyramids,like Russian dolls, one inside the other. At the top of these pyramids,especially the biggest one that encompasses all the rest, are the Illuminatifamilies (Figure 3). From there they manipulate and impose their agenda forcentralisation of global power right across society. Those involved withpressure groups, which challenge the system on many and various issues, need tounderstand that they are all dealing with the same Illuminati families at thetop of the pyramid.Through their transnational corporations, the Illuminati control, among muchelse, the world’s oil, gas, electricity and water supplies, drug production and‘medicine’, and food production and distribution. Their banking system controlsgovernments, commerce and people by lending money that doesn’t exist andcharging interest on it. What we call money is only debt being passed around ascheques, wire transfers, credit and even ‘cash’. What we call cash is not money;it is debt. Money is created by issuing credit – a debt – and no matter whatform this credit may subsequently take (cash, cheques, whatever) it is alwaysrecycling debt. The word credit is Latin for ‘he trusts’ or ‘he believes’, andthat’s exactly what ‘money’ really is: a belief that it is real. It is not. Eventhe debt bit is an illusion because how can you be in debt if nothing has beengiven to you in the first place?image [../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 4: Money is merely debt; and even ‘cash’ is only an IOU promising to payat some time in the ‘future’. It is there for all to see on British banknotesWhen a bank makes a ‘loan’ it is loaning nothing. They simply type into youraccount the figure they have agreed to ‘loan’ you against your house, businessor land. They don’t create money, they create debt by tapping the keys of acomputer program and from that moment you have to pay them back the non-existent‘money’ they have ‘loaned’ you, plus interest! If you don’t do that they cantake your property – for loaning you nothing. Governments borrow ‘money’ in thesame way and taxpayers become responsible for ‘paying back’ the banks thenon-existent money that has been ‘borrowed’ on their behalf by governmentscontrolled by the same forces that own the banks. If you wrote this as fictionthey would say it was too far-fetched to be credible, but this is the reality ofthe banking fraud. British banknotes ‘promise to pay the bearer on demand thesum of’ whatever the note is said to be worth (Figure 4). How can this be? If Iowe you ten pounds and I give you ten pounds I have given you what I owe, right?Yes, if the ten pound note is money as we understand it to be. But it’s not. Itis nothing more than an IOU, a promise to pay – a debt. When you lend me tenpounds you lend me a debt and when I give you back the ten pounds I give youback the debt. How can we pay money to anyone when there isn’t any?My wife, Pam, had a letter from the police in Hampshire, England, claiming shehad been caught on a speed camera doing six miles an hour over the limit on anempty road at midnight. They wanted £60 for this crime against humanity. I wroteto a guy at Hampshire Police, a debt collector for the government who went bythe title of ‘Manager, Central Ticket Office’. I asked him how the ‘money’ couldbe paid when there was no money. Wasn’t it illegal to pay a debt with a debt andhow, therefore, was it possible to pay them without committing fraud? He refusedto answer the question no matter how many times I asked him because he had noanswer. The police document even suggested that the ‘money’ be paid by creditcard! I also asked the Chief Constable of Hampshire and the ‘Justices’ ChiefExecutive’ how it was possible to pay when there was no money, only debt. Theyalso gave me the silent treatment because they have nowhere to go except ignorethe question. Yet billions go hungry, lose their homes, live in poverty and evendie through lack of money when it is only illusory figures on computer screens.A Rothschild family communiqué to associates in New York in 1863 summed up thesituation perfectly:> ‘The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its> profits, or so dependent on its favours, that there will be no opposition from> that class; while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally> incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantages … will bear its burden> without complaint, and perhaps without suspecting that the system is inimical> to their best interests.’ The whole banking system is based on a fraud of stunning proportions to controland suppress the people. There is nothing wrong with having a unit of exchangeand calling it money. That is not my point. It is that once you have privatebanks owned by the same people creating the exchange out of nothing, andcharging interest to do so, you have all you need for global tyranny. This iswhat we have and it has been installed because the same families that controlthe banks also control the politicians that pass the banking laws. Staggering asit may be to anyone new to this, banks are allowed to lend ten times what theyhave on deposit. It is called fractional reserve lending. Every time you put apound or dollar into a bank you are giving it the right to lend ten pounds ordollars it does not have. Many people think that banks are lending depositors’money when they are actually lending fresh air, figures on a screen. When youfollow ‘money’ from bank to bank in cheques and transfers etc., you find theyare creating more and more ‘money’ from your original deposit or loan becauseeach time this is spent and ends up in a different bank, more credit is loanedagainst it. The amount of interest that banks accrue through this fraud isastonishing. The manipulation of the money/banking system is one of the mosteffective means of dictatorship by the Illuminati families and an example of thedepth to which we are scammed.People work in jobs they hate to ‘pay the mortgage’. But what is this mortgage?It is a debt paid by the bank to you in exchange for you paying them back aneven bigger debt. But you can’t – in law – pay a debt with a debt! And they sayI’m mad! See my other books for the detailed and extraordinary background to theglobal banking fraud. This Illuminati network of interconnecting banks andcompanies is using its influence (control) in government to destroy smallernon-Illuminati businesses and make everyone dependent on the elite families tosurvive. Why is it that governments continually pass laws that make life easierand more profitable for big corporations, but more difficult and costly forsmall businesses? Here you have the answer and it is a simple equation:dependency = control; diversity = freedom.In the media, the power over what we see and hear is now in ridiculously fewhands. There may appear to be ever-increasing media ‘diversity’ with more andmore television channels, but the number of those who control them and theiroutput continues to contract. When I became a television reporter/presenter inthe 1970s it was unthinkable that the regional Independent Television (ITV)stations around the United Kingdom would not be owned independently of eachother. This was thought essential for the free flow of unbiased information. Buttoday one company, Carlton–Granada, controls the whole of ITV throughoutEngland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. ‘Independent’ radio is going thesame way rapidly. Even that is not the end because the Illuminati agenda demandstotal control, and all over the world the regulation of media ownership is beingreduced or binned.The British government under Illuminati puppet, Tony Blair, has done this to anoutrageous extent and seeks to allow more foreign ownership of the media so thatglobal corporations like Disney, and others, can move in. The United StatesFederal Communications Commission (FCC), headed by Colin Powell’s son, Michael,is continually pressing for limits on ownership to be relaxed still further.This is allowing a few Illuminati corporations to own enormous swathes of thenational and global media and destroy what is left of diversity of output andview. The idea is to control information to such an extent that people will onlysee and hear what suits the Illuminati dictatorship. This is exactly what GeorgeOrwell envisioned in his book, 1984. A media group called Clear Channel, whichhas close connections to the Bush family, is one example. It has purchased avast number of US radio stations and dictates the ‘news’ output. In Detroitalone it owns seven of the city’s most popular stations. Before and during the2003 invasion of Iraq, Clear Channel was funding rallies aimed at gatheringsupport for the war while suppressing alternative views on its airwaves.Major corporations like General Electric control the US television networks fromwhich most Americans get their ‘news’. General Electric owns the NBC network,CNBC, MSNBC, Bravo, Mun2TV, Sci-Fi channel, Trio, WNBC – New York, KNBC LosAngeles, WMAQ Chicago, WCAU Philadelphia, KNTV San Jose/San Francisco, KXAS –Dallas/Fort Worth, WRC Washington, WTVJ Miami, KNSD San Diego, WVIT Hartford,WNCN Raleigh, WCMH Columbus, WVTM Birmingham, WJAR Providence, KVEA/KWHY LosAngeles, WNJU New York, WSCV Miami, KTMD Houston, WSNS Chicago, KXTX Dallas/FortWorth, KVDA San Antonio, KSTS San Jose/San Francisco, KDRX Phoenix, KNSO Fresno,KMAS Denver, WNEU Boston/Merrimack, KHRR Tucson and WKAQ Puerto Rico.1 They alsoown Universal Studios, NBC Universal Television Studio and NBC UniversalTelevision Distribution. Imagine the power that gives them to implant a falsereality.Media tycoons like Rupert Murdoch head companies that control streams oftelevision and radio stations and newspapers worldwide, together with the moviestudio Twentieth Century Fox, book publishers like Harper Collins, and theDelphi Internet system. One Murdoch ‘asset’, Fox News, or Fix News to be moreaccurate, is the most biased television propaganda channel I have yet seen.Through conglomerates like General Electric, Murdoch’s News Corporation, Disneyand AOL–Time Warner, the Illuminati also control Hollywood and the musicindustry. You may see ‘different’ music labels and movie studios, butessentially the same force dominates them and decides what will and won’t beseen and heard. You will appreciate when we get to the focus of this book justhow vital this media domination is to the Illuminati agenda. It goes muchfurther and far deeper than just telling lies and hiding truths about worldevents. Without this imposition of what people largely see and hear the rest ofthe control structure would collapse.Two small examples of media manipulation and false reporting reveal the biggerstory. A former BBC journalist told me how she was asked to take a camera intothe streets and record what people thought about the Queen Mother when she diedin 2002 at the age of 101. The reporter found that ‘99 per cent’ of those sheinterviewed said they didn’t like the Queen Mother and didn’t care that she haddied. As a journalist of integrity, she reported the truth of what had happened,but found herself severely reprimanded by her bosses. The official BBC line wasthat the ‘Queen Mum’ (a really nasty piece of work) was loved and admired by thenation. The journalist asked her sycophant ‘superiors’ if they were saying sheshould have lied. ‘In the circumstances you should have bent the truth’, theysaid. She was horrified and resigned. Sadly, there are few like her and thetruth is not only bent every day, it is massacred.While I was writing this book, I had my latest experience (one of many hundreds)that highlighted the media’s extraordinary inability to report the facts – andthe public’s naive belief in what they read and hear. I was approached by atelevision programme called Celebrity Big Brother, in which ‘well-known’ peoplelive in a ‘house’ for up to two weeks while being filmed 24 hours a day. Theviewers vote to eject the ‘celebrities’ until there is one left – the ‘winner’.I met with representatives of the programme to see if, appalling as the ‘show’was, it might be an opportunity to get across information that the publicwouldn’t normally hear. I quickly decided that it wasn’t, and I never heard anyfurther from them, nor them from me. But in the two months and more thatfollowed, newspapers began to report that I was going to be on the programme.Right up to the day this was being repeated and one paper even sent a reporterto knock on my brother’s door looking for quotes about my appearance. A Sundaypaper said that I had been replaced at the last minute by someone else when Ihad never been scheduled to appear. In the ten weeks that the stories wererunning not once did any of these papers ever ask … me! Yet, nonsense as thereports were, the public believed them. I was constantly stopped in the streetto be asked about my appearance on the show and most people believed that itmust be happening because they had read it in a newspaper. Radio programmesrepeated the story and it became the accepted truth even though it was 100 percent wrong.What I have just described is how, minute by minute, people are sold a falsereality by the media. The Big Brother experience, and the Queen mother story,may be minor examples, but the same principles apply to the reporting of wars,politics, business, finance, science and all the rest – as detailed in my otherbooks like Tales from the Time Loop. People are constantly misled by acombination of incompetence, ignorance and calculated deceit. It may not matterif people wrongly believe that I am going to appear on some trash televisionshow; but it does when they accept the official story of 9/11 and themanufactured ‘war on terror’.image [../Images/00010.jpg]Figure 5: The September 11th attacks were a classic example of theProblem-Reaction-Solution technique and the ‘solutions’ were all planned longbefore the twin towers were hit. (See Alice in Wonderland and the World TradeCenter Disaster and Tales from the Time Loop for the detailed background)Then there are the microchips and surveillance cameras. You would need anhonours degree in self-delusion not to see the monumental expansion ofsurveillance technology everywhere you go. This has been justified in responseto terrorist outrages orchestrated by the very forces behind the introduction ofthe microchips and surveillance! This is the technique I have dubbedProblem-Reaction-Solution in which you secretly create a problem (like 9/11),tell the people a false story about the perpetrators and reasons behind it and,when the people say ‘something must be done’, you offer the solution to theproblem you have created (Figure 5). As we have seen since 9/11, these‘solutions’ advance the Orwellian agenda. The technique is to put the people infear so they will look to their leaders to protect them with new laws that suitthe plan for human enslavement. Dr William Sargant, a psychiatrist with theIlluminati Tavistock Institute in Britain, wrote in his 1957 book, Battle forthe Mind:> ‘Various types of belief can be implanted in people after brain function has> been deliberately disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear,> anger or excitement. Of the results caused by such disturbances the most> common one is temporarily impaired judgement and heightened suggestibility.> Its various group manifestations are sometimes classed under the heading of> ‘herd instinct’, and appear most spectacularly in wartime, during severe> epidemics, and all similar periods of common danger, which increase anxiety> and so individual and mass suggestibility. > ‘… We would be advised not to underestimate the effect on the collective> psyche in terms of fear and a desire for the authorities to “protect people”> from that fear.’ Levels of surveillance have soared to ‘protect’ (control) the people since theattacks of 9/11. When you walk through towns or cities you are watched by onecamera after another. Go into a store and it is invariably the same, as it iswith airports, train stations and even, as I experienced recently, in sometaxicabs. Sitting in that cab, with a camera recording my every move, was such asymbol of where we are, never mind where we are going. If you have a mobilephone you can be tracked to within a few feet and microchips in cars can do thesame. Your credit card records your every purchase and everywhere you go to useit; and the interconnecting databases mean that any government agency, and manyothers outside of government, can tell you your life story in intimate detail.We now have iris–recognition cameras being introduced, voice–recognitiontechnology and, oh yes, the microchipped human. How they laughed when I firstbegan to say that this is where we were heading, a system in which every childis chipped within moments of birth. ‘You’re a nutter’, I was told. Do I stillhear the sound of laughter? I think not, because human microchipping is wellunder way. They have used the Totalitarian Tiptoe to make people familiar withchipping. They started with domestic and farm animals, went on to clothing andother products, and finally came the main target – us. As always, they emphasiseall the alleged benefits of being microchipped cattle while ignoring the trueagenda. They say you would be able to track your child, have your medicalrecords available if you are hit by a truck, and get rid of those awful creditcards. ‘See how much we care?’ Everything could be put on the chip under yourskin and you could even fast-track through an airport or pay for your grocerieswithout ever having to reach for your pocket. Now doesn’t that justify being atagged animal? You know it makes sense.A United Press International (UPI) report I read in April 2004 said the USDepartment of Health and Human Services had announced a trial to ‘more closelymonitor and assist the nation’s homeless population’. Note the Orwellian use ofthe word ‘assist’ when they really mean control. Under the pilot programme, thereport said that homeless people in participating cities would be implanted withmandatory Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips so that social workers andthe police could track their movements in real-time. ‘Supporters of subdermalRFID tracking say the technology will discourage implanted homeless men andwomen from committing crimes, while making it easier for government workers toprovide social services such as delivering food and medicine’, the reportconcluded. When these people say they are launching ‘trials’, this isforked-tongue speak for: ‘We are getting our foot in the door by targetingpeople that most of the public don’t give a shit about, and when chipping is anestablished method of identification we are coming for the rest of you’.image [../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 6: The rice-sized microchip designed to turn people into robotsOne of the main companies behind all this is Applied Digital Solutions inFlorida who produce the rice-sized ‘VeriChip’ (Figures 6 and 7 overleaf). I haveseen media reports claiming that the idea of embedding chips in the human bodyremained ‘largely theoretical’ until 9/11 when a technology executive at AppliedDigital Solutions saw firefighters writing their badge numbers on their arms asidentification in case they were disfigured or trapped. This led to the idea ofchipping people, it was claimed. What utter trash. I highlighted this companybefore the attacks in a book called Children of the Matrix and its launch of achip called Digital Angel. Dr Peter Zhou, the chief scientist behind thetechnology, said before 9/11:> ‘Digital Angel will be a connection from yourself to the electronic world. It> will be your guardian, protector. It will bring good things for you. We will> be a hybrid of electronic intelligence and our own soul.’ Electronic intelligence and our own brain and central nervous system more like.The idea of microchipped people was not well received by those concerned aboutprivacy and civil liberties, and promotion of the chip was cooled for a time.But after 9/11, Applied Digital Solutions took the opportunity to strike with asales pitch of Human Chip = Human Security. It now claims to have chippedthousands of people, but the aim is for everybody to be tagged. One ofVeriChip’s early clients included Mexico’s attorney general to ‘protect him fromkidnap’; and a company called Solusat, the Mexican distributor of VeriChip, haslaunched a ‘service’ to chip children as an ‘anti-kidnapping device’. It doesn’tmention that these ‘VeriKids’, as it calls them, are kidnapped electronicallythe moment the chip goes in. Applied Digital Solutions is planning to introducethe ‘VeriKid’ scheme in other countries, including the United States.ORBCOMM, a global satellite telecommunications company, announced on its websitein late 2004 that agreement had been reached with the VeriChip Corporation, asubsidiary of Applied Digital, to provide ‘satellite and telecommunicationservices for applications to be developed for use with the world’s firstimplantable radio frequency identification (RFID) microchip …’. Jerry Eisenberg,CEO of ORBCOMM, said the relationship with VeriChip provided yet another new andimportant industry that will use their satellite system and its groundinfrastructure network to transmit messages globally. Yes, to control thepeople. If you have read my book, And The Truth Shall Set You Free, you willknow that all this was predicted a long time ago. I wrote in 1994 that the humanmicrochip would be sold to the people as a means of protecting children, havingmedical records available for doctors, and as a more convenient and thief-proofway of replacing the credit card. Applied Digital Solutions is already using allthree ruses in its marketing statements. In October 2004, theIlluminati-controlled Food and Drug Administration gave permission for thecompany to market the VeriChip (a decision never in doubt) and the US Departmentof Health and Human Services announced $139 million in grants to advance‘President Bush’s’ plan for electronic health records (microchipped people)within a decade. The people work to pay the taxes and the taxes are used tofurther imprison the people. I have even seen an article about a Barcelonanightclub offering people a faster entrance if they would agree to be chipped.Apparently, Tuesday night is now ‘implant night’ when guests can be chippedbetween drinking and dancing. How many chipping schemes are being introducedthat never make the newswires?image [../Images/00012.jpg]Figure 7: Digital concentration camps – the microchipped world symbolised byNeil Hague. It is vital for human freedom for people to refuse to be chippedWe will see the chip being used and promoted ever more widely in countless waysbecause the Illuminati global state demands it for the ultimate control of thepeople. The British government, for example, has announced plans to introducecompulsory ID cards, but this is only a stepping stone, a Totalitarian Tiptoe,to microchipping the population. The same is happening in the United States. ACIA scientist told me in 1997 that the chip is far more than a means ofelectronic tagging. The messages going from the chip to the computer are onething, but more important are the messages going the other way. He said theycould communicate with the embedded chips, either isolating an individual ordoing it en masse, and send frequencies that could cause severe pain or illness,manipulate people mentally and emotionally, and even kill. The chip could makepeople docile or aggressive, sexually high or suppressed, and affect theirthought processes so they couldn’t think straight or were influenced in theiractions by what the chip was receiving. This is the real story behind themicrochipping of humans.The aim of the system is to keep us in survival mode, always looking to tomorrowinstead of living in the moment. As John Lennon wrote: ‘Life is what happens toyou while you’re busy making other plans’. If our heads are down and we arefocused on survival or seeking ‘success’ we won’t look up and see the game thatenslaves us. A document that came to light in 1986 brilliantly described thetechniques at work in what we call ‘society’. It was called Silent Weapons for aQuiet War, and another version is reported to have been in the hands of US NavalIntelligence in 1969. The one I have was apparently found inside an IBMphotocopier bought at a second-hand sale in America. This lengthy and detaileddocument outlines a policy that has been implemented since at least the 1950s.It says the ‘quiet war was … declared by the international elite at a meetingheld in 1954’. A significant Illuminati organisation called the Bilderberg Groupfirst met in 1954 (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free) and this consists ofthe elite in global politics, banking, business, military, intelligenceagencies, and so on. The background, however, is less important than the contentbecause it encapsulates the quiet war on the human psyche:> Experience has proven that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon and> gaining control of the public is to keep them undisciplined and ignorant of> basic systems principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused,> disorganised, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other> hand. > This is achieved by:> 1.disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a> low-quality programme of public education in mathematics, system design and> economics, and discouraging technical creativity.> 2.engaging their emotions, increasing their self indulgence and their> indulgence in emotional and physical activities by:> a)unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape)> by the way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media –> especially the TV and the newspapers.> b)giving them what they desire – in excess – ‘junk food for thought’ – and> depriving them of what they really need.> c)rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation,> thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly> fabricated outside priorities.> These preclude their interest in, and discovery of, the silent weapons of> social automation technology. The general rule is that there is profit in> confusion; the more confusion, the more profit.

It makes no obvious noises, causes no> obvious physical injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone’s> daily social life. > Yet it makes an unmistakable ‘noise’, causes unmistakable physical and mental> damage, and unmistakably interferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable> to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for.

It attacks the> vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing,> understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social> energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses. Recognise that society? Of course, we live in it. The scale of the deceit isextraordinary – even down to your name. Have you noticed that when you receivecorrespondence relating to government, law and anything to do with finance,including taxation, your name is always spelt out in all upper case, as in DAVIDICKE? This is because your upper case name is not you. It is a corporation/trustset up by the government through the treasury department at your birth. Everytime a child is born a corporation/trust is created using his or her name in allupper case. They do this because governments are corporations and they operateunder commercial law, the law of contracts. The laws passed by governments onlyapply to corporations and not to living, breathing, flesh and bloodsovereign-free men and women spelt in upper–lower or all lower case, as withDavid Icke, or david icke. The living, breathing sovereign man and woman issubject to common law, not the commercial law introduced by governments throughlegislation.Using commercial law makes it much easier to install an ‘elected’ dictatorshipbecause, unlike common law, you are not subject to precedents built up overcenturies. You simply have to get a majority to vote for a bill in Parliament orCongress, or have the US President sign a document, and the law is imposed. Whatyou also have to do – clearly not difficult – is to keep from the people theknowledge that their name in upper case is not them. They will then pay youtaxes and be subject to your jurisdiction and control in all areas of theirlives by unknowingly standing surety for the corporation – ‘DAVID ICKE’ – thatthey don’t even know exists. In the United States you may notice that thenational flag always has a gold fringe when displayed in a court or federalbuilding and you see this also on the uniforms of US troops. This is becauseunder the International Law of the Flags a gold fringe indicates thejurisdiction of commercial law, also known as British Maritime Law and, in theU.S., the Uniform Commercial Code or UCC. Americans think that their governmentand legal system is pegged in some way to the Constitution, but it is not. TheUnited States, like Britain and elsewhere, is ruled by commercial law toovercome the checks and balances of common law. It’s another monumental fraud.When Pam received the speeding ticket from Hampshire Police, her name was speltin the letter in all upper case. They could not have done it any other way ortheir traffic law would not apply because it is a commercial law applicable onlyto a corporation. I wrote to the police to point out that they had sent theirthreat of prosecution to a corporation and not to the lower-case living,breathing sovereign woman of the same name. I asked how a corporation coulddrive a car and challenged them to prove their jurisdiction over a live womanunder their commercial law. All they would say is that the law was passed by thegovernment and there was nothing more to discuss.The chief debt collector in the speed camera department said they spelt thenames in all upper case for the benefit of clarity. Or, to be more accurate, hesaid that this is what he had been taught was the reason. We are back to thecompartmentalised pyramids again. The fodder employed to enforce the system mustalso be ignorant of what they are really involved with and they are given afalse explanation for why things are done as they are. At least this guy said hehad been taught; everyone else in the system I have asked about the use of uppercase names had never even thought about it before. I have spoken with clerks ofcourt, lawyers and financial people, and they said they had no idea why theyalways had to use names in all upper case. ‘Maybe it’s just the way the systemis set up’, said one clerk of the court. Yes it is, but this has nothing to dowith ‘clarity’. It is because commercial law only applies to corporations and sothey must use upper case names because governments are corporations. I wrote tothe Hampshire police guy to say that if clarity was the only reason for theupper case name would he please resend their threat of prosecution with Pam’sname in lower case. After all, there would be no problem with clarity because weall knew who we were. He refused. Of course he did. The system wouldn’t let himand even if he had tried to type in a lower case name, the police computersystem would have defaulted to upper case. Such is the scale of the fraud thatpeople are being prosecuted by laws that don’t apply to them and fined ‘money’that doesn’t exist. Amazing, but true.The detail and sources for what I have outlined, and so much more, can be foundin my other books, like And The Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret andTales from the Time Loop. But just look around and you can clearly see what ishappening once you know the agenda and the techniques used to achieve it; theworld becomes an open book when you understand the game. So much of the globaldictatorship is in place already. The Illuminati families control the money(debt) in your pocket or bank; they control the companies that provide most ofthe food, drink and power supplies, including the fuel in your car; they controlthe drugs you take and doctors you see; and they dictate what is taught in theschools, colleges and universities. They also control what mainstream ‘science’researches through their choices of funding, and they control the governmentsthat pass laws which suit their agenda and undermine or destroy theiropposition. They are a few years from completion with 2012 apparently a targetperiod for them, it would seem. Once they have the global government structure,and especially the mass microchipping of the people, their fascist dictatorshipwill be revealed on a scale of horror and sickness that few could currentlyimagine. But this doesn’t have to be. Our destiny is in our own hands if only wewill grasp it.The secret agenda explains the endless contractions in our societies. People askwhy things are done a certain way when there are obviously better options, butthey don’t realise that the power structure is not there to make things betteror more effective for the population; it has been created to serve theIlluminati agenda for human enslavement. So, as writer Michael Ellner has said:> ‘Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors> destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge,> governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions> destroy spirituality.’ Why? Because they’re meant to.Source > 1Columbia Journalism Review: http://www.cjr.org/tools/owners/> [http://www.cjr.org/tools/owners/]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO Beyond the Veil > Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong> Oscar Wilde As I followed the clues that revealed the extraordinary scale and depth of theglobal conspiracy, it soon became clear that even this was only one level of thestory. From the latter years of the 1990s, the synchronicity of my life wasleading me into areas of knowledge and awareness beyond the five senses.Understanding the nature of these other dimensions or realities was fundamentalto identifying the force that was behind the Illuminati.Everything in what we call Creation is energy resonating at differentfrequencies. The slower it vibrates the denser it appears to be (like a wall);the faster it vibrates the less and less dense and ‘solid’ it appears until theenergy is vibrating so quickly that it leaves the frequency range perceivable bythe five senses. What we call matter is energy resonating to a slow vibration.Albert Einstein’s famous equation E=mc2, written in 1905, says that mass/matteris a very concentrated form of energy, and concentrated is certainly the word.If you converted all the energy in one kilogram of sugar or water it would powera car non-stop for around 100,000 years. Other dimensions of reality, which somecall the ‘spirit world’, are simply realms vibrating too fast for us to see.It is easier now to talk of multiple realities because many scientists havebegun to catch up with the mystics, psychics and others who have been saying allalong that this ‘physical’ world is only one reality within an InfiniteConsciousness. These scientists would say other realities are parallel universesand part of a single unified energy field. Quantum physics, which exploresreality beyond the ‘physical’ world of the atom, is saying basically the same asthe mystics, and people like me, who talk of different dimensions andfrequencies of existence interpenetrating our own. Spirituality and true science– in its open-minded, open-hearted form – are essentially at one. It ismainstream science and mainstream religion that has caused the apparent riftbecause they are slaves to arrogance, ignorance and dogma. One is not scienceand the other is not spiritual. They are two polarities of the same falsehood.The open-minded quantum physicist would have no problem with most of what I amgoing to say in this book, while the cap-touching, protecting-my-funding,mainstream ‘scientist’ would roll his eyes in bewilderment. Such is the chasm ofview that exists in the so-called scientific community. But it is the mainstream‘safe’ version of scientific ‘fact’ that has dominated the academic text booksand university lecture-theatres because that suits the agenda for human control.The power structure wants us to believe that we are merely bodies being shuffledfrom a cradle to a grave and what happens on the conveyor belt in between iscalled ‘life’. In mainstream society we are given the choice of believing thatat the end of this life we either cease to exist, or we become subject to somedictatorial God who loves us so much he is quite prepared to send us into thefires of hell if we don’t bow the head and bend the knee. I rejected bothchoices from an early age. They seemed equally ridiculous to me and it was onlyafter my journey consciously began after 1990 that I found answers that madesense. I realised – or remembered, more like – that what we call Creation ismade up of infinite frequencies and dimensions all sharing the same space. Theyare like the radio and television stations broadcasting to where you are now.They are ‘around’ you and inside your body, but they are not consciouslyinterfering with you or each other because they are on different frequencies.Only when the frequencies are very close on the dial do we have interference. Ifyou tune to Radio A that is what you will hear. You don’t hear the othersbecause you are not tuned to their frequencies, but they still exist and otherpeople will be listening to them. When you move your dial from Radio A to RadioB, you are now hearing Radio B, of course, but Radio A doesn’t disappear whenyou move the dial. It goes on broadcasting – existing – it’s just that you can’thear it any more. These simple principles describe the nature of existence inour reality and other connected dimensions. These different ‘worlds’ can sharethe same space because they are resonating at different frequencies.When our consciousness enters a ‘physical’ body some time after conception, itbecomes locked in, tuned in, to this frequency range; so when babies are bornthey see this ‘world’ and not another one. It is also quite possible to be tunedto one primary reality but still be aware of others, through what we call thesixth sense of ‘psychic’ sight, intuition or hearing. Psychics tune theirconsciousness to other frequencies and access a channel for information to becommunicated. Some of this can be fantastically advanced, some utter nonsense.It depends on the communicator and the quality of the ‘channel’ or psychic.There are countless stories of babies clearly seeing things that others couldn’tsee, and of young children having ‘friends’ – spirit beings – who visit them.Young children are especially open to this because they arrive with their fullrange of psychic potential before ignorant parents, child psychologists, and‘Education’ close them down. In these circumstances, children soon learn thatswitching off their inter-dimensional abilities is less hassle than using them.The Illuminati power structure wants the population to perceive only the worldof the five senses, and our societies are almost entirely aimed at entrancingthe senses of sight, sound, taste, touch and smell. People are so much easier todeceive and control when they are detached from higher sources of information,intuition and inspiration. This was the motivation behind the creation of the‘this world is all there is’ version of ‘science’, the one that dominates theschools and universities to this day. The major religions are also used todefend the walls of this reality by labelling those who communicate with otherdimensions as servants of the Devil. Hundreds of thousands were killed duringthe Inquisition alone for having inter-dimensional gifts. When you say you are‘hearing voices’ or ‘seeing spirit visions’ they condemn or ridicule you; butwhen you say the Christian ‘God’ is on the line or you have seen a vision of‘Mother Mary’, they want to build you a shrine. The difference is that onechallenges the belief system, while the other sells it.Animals don’t experience this shut-down process, watch television or go toschool and university, and they retain their ability to see beyond the frequencyrange of human sight. You often see cats reacting to what appears to be ‘emptyspace’. ‘What’s wrong with the cat?’ people ask. Nothing is ‘wrong’. The cat isjust seeing something you can’t see in a frequency range beyond your fivesenses. You must have heard stories over the years of dogs and cats thatwouldn’t enter a house or room that was said to be haunted. The people involveddon’t see or feel anything, but the animals do because they are using thenatural sensitivities that society has closed down in so many humans.Comparatively few animals died in the devastating tsunami that hit Asia in late2004 because of their ability to sense the vibrations of danger. H.D. Ratnayake,deputy director of Sri Lanka’s Wildlife Department, said: ‘No elephants aredead, not even a dead hare or rabbit. I think animals can sense disaster. Theyhave a sixth sense. They know when things are happening’. Yes, they do, but thispotential is suppressed in humans. After my awakening in 1990, I began to regainsome of the abilities that lie dormant in everyone until they are triggered, andthese have continued to expand. One aspect of this is to know something. Youdon’t know how you know, you just do. It is not an arrogance that says, ‘I knoweverything and you don’t’; nor are you asking anyone to believe that you know.It is a state beyond mind, thought or emotion. You just know from somewhere verydeep. When I have a know even my body resonates in a particular way. I havethought things that were not right, but thought is a much lower level ofperception, as we shall see. A know has never let me down and this has provedinvaluable in charting a path through the misinformation (thought to be true,but isn’t) and disinformation (purposely given to mislead) that was coming fromall sides as I sought to uncover the truth of what was really happening behindthe veil of public statements and the TV news.I began to realise that the conspiracy was much bigger than just a group offamilies seeking global control. In my meetings with a stream of people withknowledge and experiences to share about the ‘other world’ connection, it wasclear that the ‘human’ network of the Illuminati was only one level of amultidimensional conspiracy. The rabbit hole goes far deeper than even mostconspiracy writers believe or are prepared to investigate. The next level ofmanipulation beyond the ‘human’ Illuminati involves entities in anotherdimension or realm that is very close to this one on the frequency spectrum. Youcould think of it as two radio stations close enough on the dial to interferewith each other. These entities take many forms, but the key one appears to bereptilian in nature. I have met hundreds of people in more than 40 countries whohave claimed to have seen these other-dimensional beings and they mostlydescribe their appearance as reptilian. I outline in other books the reams offolklore and ancient accounts throughout the world that refer to the samereptilian entities that people report seeing today. Credo Mutwa, the Zulushaman, or Sanusi, calls them the Chitauri – the ‘Children of the Serpent’ or‘Children of the Python’, and he talks about them at great length in the Bridgeof Love video/DVD series called The Reptilian Agenda.image [../Images/00013.jpg]Figure 8: Human sight can only perceive an almost immeasurable fraction of thematter/energy estimated to exist in the universe and yet still people ridiculethe suggestion that we are not alone because they’ve never seen an ‘alien’!HystericalA recurring theme of the ancient and modern accounts is the way these entitiescan ‘shape-shift’ between a human and reptilian form. This will sound fantasticto most people, but when you appreciate the illusory nature of the ‘body’, itwill be much easier to understand how shape-shifting is possible. The body isnot ‘solid’, it just appears that way to the five senses, as we will pursue inmore detail shortly. The body is a vibrating energy field and the shape-shiftingis not between two ‘solid’ forms, the human and reptilian; it is a switchbetween fields of resonating energy. These other-dimensional reptilians ‘wear’ ahuman body like a spacesuit while manipulating from behind the vibrational veil.This veil is what we call the electromagnetic spectrum and human sight can ‘see’a mere fraction even of that (Figures 8 and 9).We can only see so-called ‘luminous matter’, which reflects electromagneticlight; but 95 per cent – at least – of the mass in the universe is known as‘dark matter/energy’. This doesn’t reflect light and therefore cannot be seen,although it can be measured by its affect on the ‘seeable’ universe. What iscalled ‘ordinary matter’ makes up some 4.5% of the mass. This can be potentiallyseen by technology, but only a minimal amount has been observed so far. Theelectromagnetic spectrum is only 0.005 per cent of the estimated mass of theuniverse and yet human sight can see only a minute fraction even of theseelectromagnetic frequencies. Imagine how infinitesimal must be the figure forhow little of the known universe human sight can perceive! Our eyes can see onlyone tiny frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum called ‘visible light’– the colours of the rainbow between red and violet. (Many animals can seefurther into the electromagnetic spectrum.) As one writer put it, humans arevirtually blind. So our eyes can detect only a fraction of the electromagneticspectrum, which itself is only 0.005 per cent of known energy/matter, and stillenormous numbers of comatose people (including ‘scientists’) ridicule thesuggestion that we are not alone or that other forms of life, very differentfrom humans, could possibly exist. How breathtakingly absurd and these are thevery ones who laugh at others! But because most people believe what the‘experts’ say, this nonsense is perpetuated in the public mind.image [../Images/00014.jpg]Figure 9: Even within the electromagnetic spectrum only a fraction – ‘visiblelight’ – can be accessed by human visionThe Reptilians and other non-human entities operate in the realms unseen byhuman sight. When they do move in and out of our tiny frequency range they seem,to human witnesses, to suddenly ‘appear’ and ‘disappear’, but, in fact, theyhave only entered our frequency range and then left. They have not disappeared,just exited the frequencies that our limited sense of sight can access. When ourfive senses look at these Illuminati families, like the British Royals, theBushes, and so on, we see their five-sense form – apparently human. But behindthat mask is the reptilian entity vibrating on a slightly different frequencyand controlling the thought processes and actions of the ‘human’ level. Put mostsimply, the human body is ‘possessed’ by the reptilian, which is able to hidefrom public view, and the population has no idea who is really in control(Figures 10 and 11 overleaf).image [../Images/00015.jpg]image [../Images/00016.jpg]Figures 10 and 11: We see the ‘human’ form of the Illuminati bloodlinesvibrating within the frequency of ‘visible light’, but they are ‘possessed’ byReptilian and other entities operating in the realms beyond human sightThis explains why the Illuminati families have obsessively interbred overthousands of years in our perspective of time. The motivation is not onlysnobbery, as some believe. DNA is a frequency field that carries the data forwhat we call our genetic nature and inheritance. The closer the frequencies areon the dial, the more interference there will be. In other words, the moreconnection between them there will be. The reason for the interbreeding, and whythe upper levels of the Illuminati are the same bloodline, is because their DNAcarries a frequency field extremely close to, and compatible with, the reptilianentities operating just beyond the range of the five senses. This sympatheticresonance allows the Reptilians and other entities to ‘possess’ – take over –these bodies (Illuminati families) far more effectively than the humanpopulation in general.All human bodies have a huge amount of reptilian genetics, including theR-complex or reptilian brain (Figure 12). This is the oldest part of the brain,according to scientists, and gives us character traits such as cold-bloodednesswhere there is no empathy with the victims of our actions; ‘territoriality’ anda desire to control; an obsession with hierarchical structures of power;aggression, and the idea that might is right, winner takes all. These are thevery characteristics always displayed by the Illuminati and their agents. Thisis no surprise because the more reptilian genetics we have the more we arelikely to display such behaviour. Interestingly, the top of the Reptilianmanipulating hierarchy has been connected by researchers to the Draco starconstellation and certainly the word ‘draconian’ encapsulates their mindset.When we speak of beings from other planets and star systems, this does notnecessarily refer to the ‘physical’ level of them within the visible light rangeof the electromagnetic spectrum. Everything is multi-dimensional and there are,for example, many frequency levels of the earth that we cannot see, where othercivilisations exist. When people talk of life on other planets they refer onlyto the ‘physical’ five-sense reality, but planets have multiple realitiesvibrating on other wavelengths. Just because other planets of the solar systemappear ‘lifeless’ to our sight and technology doesn’t mean they aren’t teemingwith life on other frequency levels.image [../Images/00017.jpg]Figure 12: The reptilian brain, or ‘R-complex’, is the oldest part of the humanbrain. It represents the base instinct of survival and produces the charactertraits of cold-blooded behaviour, a desire to control, an obsession withhierarchical structures of power and the idea that might is right, winner takesall. These are the very traits of the Illuminati bloodlinesThe whole focus of the reptilian brain is survival and the Illuminati seek tocontrol us through this fundamental fear. The war on terror is blatantlymanipulating the fear of not surviving, and George Bush’s entire 2004 Americanpresidential campaign targeted the reptilian brain to connect survival(protection from terrorism) with a Bush presidency. This reptilian fear of notsurviving is so powerful that around half the voters in America gave an idiot asecond term because the man who had killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians,caused more than a thousand troops to die, triggered violence around the world,and took away their basic freedoms, was considered the best guy to keep themsafe! The reptilian brain is about fight-or-flight, attack-or-run, hunger andfear, and reacts overwhelmingly to what is called ‘visceral stimulus-response’.This is to respond with emotional reaction, rather than reasoned thought. Doesthat describe a Bush voter, or what? The reptilian brain also reacts mostpowerfully to visual stimulus rather than verbal, and this is why the politicalspinners take so much trouble over the presentation of political events with theemphasis on visual image, rather than verbal substance. An article in the LosAngeles Times highlighted another expression of the reptilian brain – greed andexcess. It was headed: ‘Living Ever Larger; How Wretched Excess Became a Way ofLife in Southern California’. French anthropologist G. Clotaire Rapaille isquoted as saying:> ‘… The desire for excess comes from the “reptilian brain,” the earliest, most> primitive structures in our mental evolution. The reptilian wants to grab as> much food as possible, to be as big and powerful as possible, because it’s> focused on survival. When it comes to a choice between the intellect and the> reptilian, the reptilian always wins. image [../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 13: The two-faced (and then some) Illuminati manipulating human societyunder the control of the Reptilians> ‘Satisfying that inner lizard has its downsides.

We> demand things that, deep down, we don’t really want or even use.’ This is the mentality of the Illuminati and they have structured society totarget the reptilian brain in the population. The Illuminati secret societynetwork manipulates its bloodlines into positions of power in politics, banking,business, media, military etc., and the reptilian entities possessing thosebloodlines run the show while the rest of the population can only see their‘human’ level (Figure 13) This is why American presidents have had suchastonishing ‘blue blood’ genetic ancestry going back to the royal andaristocratic families of Europe and further afield. I have highlighted in mybooks the significance to the Illuminati of Charlemagne (742-814), also known asCharles the Great, the King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor (Figure 14overleaf). It is no bizarre coincidence, therefore, that 35 of the 43 presidentsfrom Washington to Bush descend from the Germanborn Charlemagne; nor is itcoincidence that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were also obsessed with the guy.Hitler’s home at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria looked out at the Untersberg Mountainswhere it was believed the spirit of Charlemagne was residing until he rose tomake Germany great again. The Nazis were a creation of the Illuminati and wereespecially influenced by a strand in the network known as the BavarianIlluminati, officially created in 1776. This organisation also controlled primeplayers behind the formation of the United States. Presidents are not elected byballot; they are selected by blood – reptilian blood. On another level this isbetter described as selected by resonance – reptilian resonance. It actuallygoes even further than this, as I will explain later.The Bush family is descended from Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the Impaler, the 15thcentury ruler of a country called Wallachia, not far from the Black Sea in whatis now Romania (Figure 15 overleaf). This region was once called Transylvania,home of the vampire legends, and Vlad Dracul was the inspiration for BramStoker’s Dracula. Vlad the Impaler slaughtered tens of thousands of people andimpaled many of them on stakes. He would sit down to eat amid this forest ofdead bodies, dipping his bread in their blood, and he usually had a horseattached to each of the victims’ legs as a sharpened stake was gradually forcedinto their bodies. The end of the stake was oiled and care was taken that thestake not be too sharp because he didn’t want the victim dying too quickly fromshock. Infants were often impaled on the stake forced through their mothers’chests. Nice man. Vlad Dracul was an initiate of the Royal Court of the Dragon,also known as the Brotherhood of the Snake, formed in Egypt from around 2000BCto advance the power of the reptilian bloodline (see The Biggest Secret andChildren of the Matrix). The British Royal Family is also related to VladDracul’s bloodline through Mary of Teck, the grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II.image [../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 14: Charles the Great, or Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Holy RomanEmperor, who lived from 742 to 814. His bloodline is highly significant to theIlluminati and 35 of the 43 presidents from George Washington to George W. Bushdescend from the German-born monarch. Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were alsoobsessed with himimage [../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 15: Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the Impaler, the 15th century ruler of Wallachiain the region once called Transylvania – now Romania. Dracul was the inspirationfor Bram Stoker’s Dracula and many Illuminati families descend from this line,including the Bushes and Windsors. Queen Elizabeth II is related to Vlad theImpaler through her grandmother, Mary of TeckThe ‘royal’ connection to the Illuminati bloodlines is simple to explain. Aeonsago in what we call time, interbreeding began between humans and these reptilianand other entities. This is the origin of the constantly recurring storiesthroughout the ancient world about the ‘gods’, as they were perceived,interbreeding with human women. The best-known version is in the Bible, whichtells in Genesis of the Sons of God who interbred with the daughters of men tocreate a hybrid race called the Nefilim. The texts from which the Englishversion was translated referred to the sons of the gods, plural, not the sons ofa singular God. Almost every culture throughout the world has a similar story,including the Sumerians (4,000 to 2,000BC) in what is now Iraq. Their accountstold of the interbreeding with a non-human race called the Annunaki, and thehybrid children this produced. In southern Africa the same tale was told aboutthe Chitauri, the ‘Children of the Serpent’. Everywhere the story recurs, asdoes the theme of shape-shifting. In Asia, they had ancient gods they called theNagas, whom they said could take either human or reptilian form.These hybrid human–reptilian bloodlines became the ‘royal’ families of theancient world and the idea of the ‘Divine Right to Rule’ was born. In truth,this ‘right’ was claimed because certain families had a genetic link to the‘gods’ and acted as hybrid middlemen or ‘demi-gods’. It was they who became thekings, queens and emperors. In China, emperors claimed the right to rule asdescendents of the ‘serpent gods’ and the foundation of Chinese culture, ofcourse, is the dragon, an ancient symbol for the Reptilians. The ancient kingsof Media, near what today is Iran, were known as the ‘Dragon Dynasty of Media’,or the ‘descendents of the dragon’, and in Children of the Matrix I show how thetheme of reptilian gods and their hybrid kings and queens is a globalphenomenon. The same hybrid bloodlines are still in the positions of power todayas political leaders and those who control the banking system, transnationalcorporations, media etc., hence the ‘royal’ genetic background to the dynasty ofUnited States presidents from Washington to Bush.Babylon, in modern-day Iraq, is a crucial part of the story of the Illuminatiand their bloodlines because it was once one of their ancient strongholds. Thehybrid bloodlines expanded out of Babylon, Sumer, Egypt and elsewhere to rulenot only Rome (thus the Roman Empire), but the whole of Europe. They became theEuropean royal and aristocratic families and Britain, France and Germany becamemajor Illuminati operational centres, especially London or Babylon-don. In thesame way that the Illuminati were behind the Roman Empire, so they spawned theBritish Empire, the biggest ever known, or at least recorded. This, and otherEuropean empires, became the means through which the hybrid bloodline was placedin power across the world, including what became the United States of America.When the European empires apparently withdrew from their former colonies it wasonly a sleight of hand to deceive the people. They left behind the bloodline andthe secret society networks that manipulated the bloodline into power, and theyhave continued to control those countries ever since. The only difference isthat they have more power now because at least under colonial rule the peopleknew who their masters were. Today they think they are running their owncountries when, in fact, a hidden force has its hand on the tiller, and thepoliticians that the people think they have elected to lead them are onlypuppets. My other books have all the background and sources to support what I amdescribing here.As I have been exposing for years in considerable detail, the Illuminatifamilies continue to practice the same blood drinking and human sacrificerituals they have been performing since the ancient world – not least Babylon.This includes some of the most famous families and people on the planet, likethe British Royal Family, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Bushes and a long list thatI reveal in other works. Vlad the Impaler, an ancestor of the Bushes andWindsors, was an infamous example of the obsession with blood drinking andritual sacrifice. The Dracula character he inspired was a shape-shifting vampirewith the title of ‘Count’, symbolic of the way the Reptilian bloodlines havebeen carried by ‘human’ royalty and aristocracy. Dracula is not justmake-believe. His like exist and they are in positions of national and globalpower.The rituals are designed to achieve many things, including the interbreeding Ihave described. I should stress that this does not have to happen only throughphysical sex between a human woman and a Reptilian entity. I have been told bywomen who have been raped in satanic rituals (several of them under the Mormontemple at Salt Lake City) that whilst a ‘human’ man was having sex with them hewas overshadowed by a non-physical entity channelling energy through the rapistat the time of orgasm. These energies – frequencies – recode the DNA of theresulting child into the frequency pattern of the Reptilian or other entity, somaking the child compatible for ‘possession’. You could think of it as rewritinga computer program or adding additional information to a disk. What holds theinformation on a computer disk? – a magnetic field. It is the same principlewith DNA and this theme will be developed in the next few chapters. In fact, themore we understand about the nature of DNA, it is clear there are other ways torewrite its program. The rituals performed by Illuminati initiates also createan energy environment that allows the Reptilians and others to cross from theirdimension into this one. Many people who have participated in these ritualsagainst their will have told me of seeing Reptilians and other entitiesmanifesting during the ceremonies, and of ‘human’ participants shape-shiftinginto reptilian form. They are obsessed with blood drinking because it carriesthe frequency, DNA codes and life force of the victim. Just as electricitypasses powerfully through water, so it is with the life essence energy carriedin the blood. (By the way, Roman Polanski’s 1968 movie, Rosemary’s Baby,portrayed this interbreeding and involved a reptilian entity.)Another reason for the rituals, especially involving human sacrifice, is thatother-dimensional reptilians feed off human fear. That is their prime energysource because they appear to operate in an ‘in-between’ world that GiulianaConforto, an Italian astrophysicist and esoteric researcher, calls the‘interspaces’ (Figure 16). These lie between this dimension and the next one, atleast from our perspective of reality, and they might even be like vibrationalcrevices within our dimension, too. Credo Mutwa, the South African Sanusi andofficial historian of the Zulu nation, told me that in his culture they call theinterspaces the ‘heaven between heavens’ and ‘that’s where the Reptilians are’,he said. In the third of the Matrix movies they had a similar concept, thein-between world controlled by a computer program called the Train Man.Interspaces don’t have an energy source like dimensions do. They are, bycomparison, sort of neutral zones, gaps in the fabric of our reality from whichwe can be manipulated mentally and emotionally. Anyone operating there wouldneed to create an energy source, which they have – us. They are harvesting fear,and they have structured the world to generate as much as possible in the formof not only sheer terror, but also fear of the future, worry, guilt, regret ofthe past, depression, frustration and stress in all its forms. These are thevery emotions and states of mind that the system I described earlier isguaranteed to produce.The human sacrifices engaged in by these world famous Illuminati names, andothers, are structured to induce maximum terror in the victim and trigger anadrenalin release that enters the bloodstream in moments of extreme fear andstress. This is like an elixir to the Reptilian Satanists and they drink theblood of the victims as soon as they are killed, often before, when theadrenalin is at its most powerful. The concentrated fear and terror of thevictim is also being absorbed by entities in the interspaces, which areextremely close vibrationally to our ‘human’ reality. This is the origin of theancient theme of people making human sacrifices to the gods. The energy theentities want most is that of prepubescent children, especially young girls withblonde hair and blue eyes. Red hair is another trait they seek. It has nothingto do with how these girls look; it is what these genetic characteristics revealabout the frequency and make-up of their DNA field. The sacrifice of young girlsis, once again, the origin of the ancient theme of sacrificing a ‘young virgin’to the gods. Almost everyone accepts that these things did happen, but what mostpeople don’t realise is that they still do and many of the millions of childrenwho go missing every year end up on the satanic altars of the rich and famous,or their underlings. (While this book was at the production stage I receivedinformation and pictures from a therapist in Australia that yet again supportsthe satanic abuse/reptilian connection. See Appendix II.)image [../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 16: Beyond the frequency of human sight lie the interspace planes betweenthis dimension and the next. These are the realms of the Reptilian manipulatorsand other entities that seek to possess the Illuminati bloodlines and any othersthat fall vibrationally into their clutchesAs I entered what we call the 21st century, many pieces in the puzzle werecoming together. The world was controlled by a network of secret societiesmanipulated by the Illuminati, who had structured the world to create maximumfear and stress. This was feeding the Reptilians and other entities in theinterspaces, and the more wars, conflict, terror, despair and grief that couldbe generated by human events, the more power the Reptilians and company wouldhave to recycle back against us, and speed the rate at which thisenergy-generator called human ‘life’ would spin. ‘Life’ is getting quicker andmore stressful and fearful because they are upping the spin speed of thegenerator – human societies. The world government structure I have described(microchipping in particular) is designed to control us and harvest our energyeven more effectively. But there is, you will be delighted to know, a way out ofthis, as I will come to later.Staggering as this information will be to so many, even the Reptilians are onlyanother level of the story. It is far, far bigger than that. The guiding force Ihave been aware of since my awakening experiences in 1990 is now leading me tothe next layer of the cosmic maze, beyond the Reptilians and even the realms ofdimension and vibration. In short, the world we think we see is an illusion thatwe have been manipulated to believe is real. This is the foundation conspiracythat has spawned all the others and this knowledge is the key to ending ourenslavement. My focus has always been drifting into these areas because it is aprime interest of mine, but from the turn of 2003 it began to take centre stageand some incredible revelations have been communicated to me.Carol, a psychic friend of mine, told me some months before I started this bookthat I would now be dealing with information that could not be proven, but thatpeople needed to know. This has certainly turned out to be the case. While muchof what I am going to say is supportable by even mainstream science, a lot of itis not. Or, at least, not yet at this point in scientific knowledge. But thatdoesn’t mean it’s not true and it doesn’t matter anyway because I’m not askinganyone to believe it. If it doesn’t make sense to you, bin the book. What youbelieve is your right and no business of mine. Proof is only what someoneaccepts to be so, anyway. One man’s proof can be another man’s nonsense. I knowthat the themes I am about to describe are correct, but I am not asking anyoneto accept that they are. People must decide for themselves what they make of it.How deep does the rabbit hole go? Far deeper than most people can begin toimagine and certainly further than they are prepared to explore. I’m ready to goanywhere, no matter how apparently bizarre, because I want to know the truth andthe answer to the age-old question: What the fuck is it all about?Thank you for joining me in this journey beyond mind, thought and preconception,as we explore the depths of the illusion we call Life. You’ll need a very largetorch and bring lots of batteries."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE Downloading Reality > One’s real life is so often the life that one does not lead> Oscar Wilde How many people who dismiss all this illusion stuff as bonkers know that theydon’t even see with their eyes? They ‘see’ with their brain. That’s the onlyplace the ‘world’ you think is ‘around’ you now exists.I’m not sitting in a darkened room coming to these conclusions while smoking aweed; this is mainstream science. Our eyes only transform light into electricalsignals that are constantly delivered to the brain for interpretation. This‘visible light’ is confined to a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum,which is, itself, only 0.005 per cent of the matter/energy in the knownuniverse. It is within this minuscule frequency range that we decode ‘light’into ‘physical’ reality. The eyes don’t send images to the brain ofthree-dimensional street scenes or forests or children playing in the park, oranything else that we think we are seeing outside of us. They send electricalsignals. Only when the brain decodes these signals into an apparent 3D realitydoes the world we believe is ‘around’ us actually exist (Figure 17). There is noworld ‘around’ us as we perceive it; everything is all happening in our brains,or at least at one level of the illusion it is.As you look at this book it certainly appears to be outside of you, but it onlyexists in your head – and, as a ‘physical’ body, so do you! The way the bookfeels and looks are electrical signals decoded by your brain and it’s the samewhen you hear, smell or taste. The ear, like all the sense organs, convertsvibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for interpretationinto sounds. Noise is in your head. There aren’t even any colours, except asneurons firing in a particular way. Colours are different wavelengths that thebrain decodes from the ‘white’ light in the electro-magnetic spectrum. We only‘see’ what the brain tells us that we see and, as experiments have shown, thatis decided by what we believe we see. There is no such thing as ‘the’ universebecause there’s a universe inside every brain, each with a different perception(Figure 18). The electrical path of a single thought can now be tracked by thelatest scanning technology, and what we believe dictates which path is taken.image [../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 17: The brain creates ‘physical’ reality by decoding electrical signalsinto a 3D holographic illusion. This is done through the visual cortex on onelevel, but the whole brain is involved because it is a hologram, as I willexplain shortlyNote that word – believe. We can now begin to appreciate the deeper reasonsbehind the Illuminati control of ‘education’ and the media, especiallytelevision. If they can implant in human minds a set of programmed beliefs aboutthe world and what is real, those beliefs will edit, via the brain, what people‘see’. This editing process will construct reality to match what they believethey should be seeing. In this way we put in detail that supports thepreconceived belief and take out that which is at odds with it. What we think wesee is dictated by preconceived ideas and that’s why the system is constantlyseeking to implant them. What do we call the information that televisionpresents to us? Television programmes. Television is tell-a-vision or, even moreaccurately, sell-a-vision.image [../Images/00023.jpg]Figure 18: The only place the ‘physical’ world exists is in your brain. There isno ‘out there’, as we perceive it; only an ‘in here’Political elections, not least in America, are not about discussing issues andwhat the candidates would do in office; they are aimed at implanting an image toedit the reality of the voters. These are the simplistic mantras and lies thatpoliticians and their spinners parrot by the hour. This is so effective that inNovember 2004 they managed to convince around half the American electorate thatGeorge W. Bush was the one to protect them from terrorism when (a) he is aterrorist of monumental proportions; (b) his decisions have led to the murder oftens of thousand of Iraqi civilians and, at the time of writing, the deaths ofwell over a thousand American troops; and (c) he sends others to fight hismanufactured wars while spending his life making sure that he never sees so muchas a bullet fired in anger. But once the belief in ‘John Wayne Bush’ isimplanted, the brain edits reality to fit. Another example is to watch twopeople talking who have preconceived ideas about each other. Neither hears whatthe other says or how they say it because their entrenched belief is editing thewords and tone to fit what they believe about the other person. We are doingthis with every image that we think we see.I told a story in Tales from the Time Loop about a hypnotist who was hired toentertain guests at a party. What happened was witnessed by Michael Talbot,author of an outstanding book called The Holographic Universe (HarperPerennial,New York, 1992). A guy called Tom was put into a hypnotic state and given apotato to eat while thinking it was an apple. To Tom, it looked and tasted likean apple because the belief implanted by the hypnotist was editing his realityas his brain decoded the electrical signals from his tongue. The hypnoticsuggestion simply reinterprets the signals, in this case from a potato to anapple. This applies to all of the five senses. There is a condition calledsynaesthesia in which the senses become confused and signals are interpreted bythe wrong sense. I saw a British television documentary in which a man calledJames Wannerton decoded sound into taste. He had a different taste for everyword. Each time he heard the name ‘Derek’, he tasted earwax; and the name ofanother customer at his pub gave him the taste of wet nappies (how did heknow??). I’d find a friend who tasted like red wine myself. Other‘synaesthetes’, as they are called, see colours when they hear or see words. Alady called Dorothy Latham told the programme that when she hears words she alsosees them as like a coloured ticker tape apparently in front of her. When shehears music she sees a riot of colour. Everything is a frequency in thisreality, including colour, and what can be decoded as sound through one sensecan be decoded as colour through another.With synaesthesia the senses get confused and this is what hypnotists (and theIlluminati) are doing – implanting false beliefs that cause the brain to decodeelectrical signals to fit the beliefs. It is like reprogramming a computer and Ihave seen demonstrations of how easy it is to do. This includes transformingatheists into religious believers in a matter of seconds and these are themind-games played by those evangelical ‘white-suits’ at the mass ‘conversion’and ‘miracle healing’ rallies. The stooges on stage, and the audience as awhole, are put into a trance-like state, open to hypnotic suggestion. Suddenly,‘I give my life to Jesus’ (and my money to the ‘ministry’) is their new reality.They say ‘Jesus is in my heart’ when, in fact, the white-suit is in their head.Many fraudulent ‘psychics’ use the same techniques. When someone says a mediumhas been 100 per cent accurate, it is often because their implanted belief hasfiltered out all that was false.The hypnotist at the Michael Talbot party told Tom that when he returned to awaking state he would not be able to see his daughter. Before he clicked hisfingers, the hypnotist led the daughter to stand right in front of her father,so Tom was sitting down looking at her belly. When he ‘came out’ of the trancestate he was asked if he could see his daughter in the room. ‘No’, he said. Hisdaughter started laughing, but Tom couldn’t hear her. The hypnotist went behindthe daughter and put his hand against her lower back. He said he was holdingsomething in his hand and could Tom tell him what it was? Tom looked a littlebemused because it seemed so obvious to him. ‘You are holding a watch’, he said.The hypnotist asked if he could read the inscription on the watch and Tom didso. All the time his daughter was standing between him and the watch!Impossible? Fantastic? Not at all. The hypnotically implanted belief that hisdaughter wasn’t there edited her from the information Tom’s brain was receiving,and when his ‘reality’ was neurologically constructed she was no longer to beseen. With his daughter removed from his personal illusion – or movie – therewas nothing to stop him seeing what was behind her.It is worth pondering on this story when you next believe without question inwhat you are seeing. When I asked the Zulu Sanusi, Credo Mutwa, why more peopledidn’t see the reptilian entities, he said it was because they are so at oddswith human reality that the brain removes them from what it ‘sees’. This is onereason why some people see ghosts and others don’t. The mystic, Sri AurobindoGhose, said that most humans possess a ‘mental screen’ that keeps us from seeingbehind ‘the veil of matter’. Clearly this is correct and the ‘veil of matter’ isthe visible light within the electromagnetic spectrum.So what is real? Whatever you believe it is or can be manipulated to believe itis. For instance, we are programmed to believe in scarcity of food, resources,water and all the rest. But how can there be scarcity in an illusion? Only ifyou believe in it. Albert Einstein said that we don’t observe nature as itactually exists, but nature exposed to our methods of perception. The theoriesdetermined what we could or could not observe. That’s right, but he could havegone further and said that there is no nature as it ‘actually exists’, except asillusion. The human race is in a hypnotic trance every bit as much as anysubject in a hypnotist’s stage show; even more so, in fact, because the stoogeon the stage only has one hypnotist working on him for a short time. In everydaylife we are all being bombarded with hypnotic implants. When we’re young we haveparents and teachers telling us what is real and possible, and throughout ourlives we have the media and peer pressure doing the same. Just as the subject inthe stage show is told there is an elephant in the audience, or that he’s eatinga banana when it’s really a lemon, so we are told that Osama bin Ladenorchestrated 9/11, and that doctors and mainstream scientists know what they’retalking about. He didn’t and they don’t, but if we believe such rubbish we willconstruct our reality to fit. As a result, we will support the war on terrorism;take prescription drugs that often do us even more damage than the ailment theyare treating; and accept that when a scientist says Infinite Consciousness doesnot exist then it must be true.Techniques like the Totalitarian Tiptoe and Problem-Reaction-Solution are majorexamples of the way the Illuminati attempt to implant a belief that we will editinto a reality that suits their agenda. The human race is in a trance, seeingwhat it is told to see, in precisely the way that Tom was at the party. We don’thave to seek enlightenment and truth, we are already enlightened. We just haveto wake-the-fuck-up, break out of the trance, and remember who we are. Aspsychiatrist R. D. Laing said: ‘If I do not know I know, I think I do not know’.Another comment of his also encapsulates the human plight: ‘We forget something;then we forget we have forgotten’. That sums up how consciousness became caughtin the illusion, or what I will call the Matrix. One aspect of the New Age‘movement’ are the ‘Workshop Groupies’ who go from seminar to seminar, guru toguru, trying to find something they already have. They don’t find it becausethey are too busy looking. We think that enlightenment is like finding theneedle in the haystack when, in fact, it is the realisation that there is noneedle and there is no hay. It is the trance-state that keeps us from thistruth.The illusion goes even deeper than our beliefs constructing our reality. I guessI started to appreciate this a few years ago when I had my first experience ofseeing the backdrop of the cosmic computer game. It was like looking at theworld through those 3D viewer things they call Viewmasters. They give you twoversions of the same picture, one for each eye, and the brain turns the flatphotographs into an illusory three-dimensional scene. If you’ve ever experiencedthis you’ll recall how the 3D effect is really pronounced, far more than normal.I began to see the world like that, briefly at first, and then for longerperiods. It looked like the 3D version of something you’d get from Nintendo.Today when I walk down a street it’s like I’m in a scene from a Matrix movie. Iam not in the world; I am detached from it – observing rather thanparticipating. It’s always a shock when anyone speaks to me in this mode becauseI feel invisible to people. When I look at the apparently ‘solid’ buildings andcars, it’s like I could put my hand through them. That may sound weird to anyonenew to this, but how can they be anything but illusion when they are onlyelectrical signals decoded by the brain? The ‘world’ is not solid at all, merelyan illusion of solidity. In one of the books of Carlos Castaneda, he quotes hisshaman source, ‘Don Juan’, as saying:> ‘We are perceivers. We are awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity.> We are boundless … We, or rather our reason, forget [this] and thus we entrap> the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in> our lifetime.’ Quantum physics explores and tries to understand the subatomic realm of realityor, put more simply, it is the study of energy in waveforms and particlesoperating beyond the ‘physical’ reality of atoms and ‘matter’. In these realms,the ‘laws’ of conventional physics (which are illusions anyway) are seen not toapply and the idea that the physical world is solid is shown to be impossible.The physical realm is constructed, scientists say, from atoms. This nameoriginates, we are told, with an ancient Greek called Democritus, who made thefirst known claim that matter was composed of tiny particles that he calledatoms. But hold on. If atoms are the building blocks of our ‘solid’ world, howcome atoms are about as least solid as you could possibly imagine? In fact, theyain’t solid at all! (Figure 19 overleaf)I know I didn’t go to university (thank you, God), but even uneducated (thankyou, God) me can see a little contradiction here. How can something that is notsolid be the building blocks that construct this ‘solid’ wall I am looking atnow? It can’t – our brains do it. With the emergence of quantum physics, sciencehas had to concede that atoms are not solid. It knows that they contain evensmaller particles consisting of a nucleus (made of protons and neutrons) thatappears to be circled by electrons. The atoms that comprise ‘physical’ matterare overwhelmingly ‘empty’ and even illustrations of this are misleading becausethere is not enough room in a book or science paper to accurately depict theproportions of particles to ‘empty space’. As one writer put it: ‘If an atom wasthe size of a cathedral, the nucleus would be about the size of a ten centpiece’. The rest is ‘empty’ to the perception of the five senses because itconsists of energy vibrating on wavelengths higher than the ‘physical’, and eventhe particles are found to be empty as you go deeper into the subatomic realm.If you magnify anything powerfully enough and go deeper than the atom, you willfind that nothing has solidity. No, not even buildings, cars, mountains or thebones in your body. It’s Iluuuuuuuusion! If you find this hard to accept, thinkof your dreams. You dream in three-dimensional images and yet no one claims theyare solid do they? This reality is the same – a dreamworld that we believe to bereal.image [../Images/00024.jpg]Figure 19: An atom is ‘empty’ to five-sense reality and so how can they be thebuilding blocks of our ‘solid’ world. They can’t – ‘solidity’ is an illusion.The electrons and nucleus (also ‘empty’) are much further apart than can beportrayed in this graphic. As one writer said: ‘If an atom was the size of acathedral, the nucleus would be about the size of a ten cent piece’I don’t go into my virtual reality ‘Viewmaster’ mode by taking drugs; itdeveloped without me doing anything consciously to make it happen. But the threeoccasions that I have taken so-called psychoactive drugs confirmed in detail thesame recurring theme. We are living in a collective dream that we have beenmanipulated to believe is solid and ‘real’. As I describe at length in Talesfrom the Time Loop, in 2003 I was invited to speak at a gathering in the Amazonrainforest in Brazil and this included the opportunity for participants toexperience the psychoactive effects of a plant called ayahuasca. This has beenused for at least hundreds of years by South American shamans to take peopleinto other states of consciousness that the five senses cannot access. Itcontains many powerful hallucinogenic properties including Dimethyltryptamine,or DMT, a naturally occurring component of the metabolism of mammals and plants.Ayahuasca is known as the ‘teacher plant’ and the ‘plant of the gods’ because itallows people to experience unseen realms or dimensions where so much can belearned about self, life and reality, and where the ‘gods’ of myth reside onfrequencies outside the range of the five senses. Indeed, the organisers invitedme to the event because of the number of times that previous participants hadseen reptilian entities and imagery in their altered states of awareness. Butagain, all these realities are also signals decoded by the frequency fields wecall the brain/body. The drug simply changes the nature of the decoding processand plugs you in to another information source. Some people have greatexperiences with the plant while others go into really dark mental and emotionalstates. It depends on the person and where their mind takes them. My twoexperiences were incredibly powerful and transformed my sense of reality. I hadlong been aware that the ‘world’ was an illusion, but now came some seriousdetail.I took the ayahuasca over two nights in the form of a liquorice-tasting drink ina small glass and I lay back on a mattress amid the darkness of a big, round,wooden building in the rainforest. After about an hour I began to enter alteredstates of awareness. I saw swirling colours and images at first when I closed myeyes, and I went deeper and deeper through levels of consciousness until Ireached a state of indescribable peace and bliss. It was beyond fear, doubt,guilt and regret; beyond time, and even vibration. All was stillness orsometimes like a slow-motion wave. In the first session only Zoe, thefacilitator, and I were in the room. As the ayahuasca kicked in, I began tospeak in a voice very unlike my own. The words were not preceded by thought;they just emerged slowly and powerfully without any help from me. It began with‘I am love’, and then, ‘I am everything and everything is me, I am infinitepossibility’. With that I felt energy begin to stream from the centre of mychest and fill the room. The human energy field in this reality isinterpenetrated by a series of vortices known as ‘chakras’, an ancient Sanskritword meaning ‘wheels of light’ (Figure 20). The one in the centre of the chestis called the heart chakra and this is the real origin of the idea of feelinglove in your heart. It is symbolised today as the physical heart, but love isexpressed through the heart chakra or vortex that connects us to the love of allthat is, a connection the manipulators are desperate to suppress with their mindgames and microchips. I would stress that all this relates to this realitybecause chakras are illusions, too.image [../Images/00025.jpg]Figure 20: The seven major vortex points, or chakras, which connect the humanbody/hologram to other levels of realityThe power of the energy coming through me was fantastic. It was like someone wassqueezing my chest at the point where the energy seemed to be pouring into theroom. A strip light on the ceiling began to flicker on and off, and then threeof the lights came on full power. I wondered why the lights had been turned onwhen the session was supposed to be in darkness. But no one had touched thelight switch and they came on without electricity, empowered by another form ofenergy. The music player also turned on and off, but as I felt the energystreaming from me I could understand why the electrical circuits were goinghaywire. The flow changed and I felt it arch from my chest to my head like someunseen rainbow. With that I began to speak fluently in my altered state. Thewords told of an Infinite Consciousness, referred to as ‘The Infinite’,‘Oneness’ and the ‘One’. Everything was Infinite Consciousness, the words said.Division and polarity were illusions of the manufactured virtual reality that Icall the Matrix and beyond the veil of illusion everything was One. There was nome or we, just an Infinite ‘I’. Even within the virtual-reality game everythingwas the same Oneness and it was only the illusion that gave the impression ofdivision. The difference was between Oneness in awareness of itself and Onenessthat had forgotten what it was. Whenever I talk about Oneness from now on I amreferring to Oneness in awareness of itself, as opposed to that caught in theillusion of division. The ancient Vedic works of India tell a similar story. Theeighth century Hindu mystic, Shankara, said: ‘Brahman [Infinite Consciousness]dwells beyond the range of Maya [illusion]. There is nothing else’.On the second night in Brazil, the ayahuasca experience was even deeper and, asmy consciousness tossed and swirled through realities, I began to hear a loud,clear, female voice speaking with great dignity and clarity. This was not, ofcourse, a woman in a body speaking through a voice box. It was consciousnesscommunicating telepathically and my brain was decoding these frequency fieldsinto words that I could understand. I heard the words in English, but had I beenItalian or Pakistani I would have decoded the consciousness fields into thoselanguages. ‘David’, the voice said, ‘we are going to take you to where you comefrom, so you can remember who you are’. With that I was taken to a realm ofindescribable bliss, even more profound and wondrous than the night before.There were no divisions, no polarities, no black and white, no us and them.There was no time, no place, no vibration. Everything just was and this is astate of being that has to be experienced to be understood. I was not my body; Iwas consciousness, all consciousness, all that exists in any expression.Everything just was. I was Oneness, Is-ness, All Possibility. But I was stillself-aware, an ‘individual’ with my own point of observation within the whole. Iwas here and I was there. I was everywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing.I was and I wasn’t, and I was all ‘in between’. It may sound mumbo-jumbo, but itwill be clearer later why encompassing polarities is the door to Oneness,completeness. ‘This is the Infinite, David’, the voice said. ‘This is where youcome from and this is where you shall “return”.’I was told that there was really only one thing I needed to know and these wordsbegan to repeat over and over in my head: ‘Infinite Love is the only truth –everything else is illusion’. I began to form a question in my thoughts: ‘Youreally mean everything?’ But before the thought could fully emerge, the voiceinterrupted. ‘Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion; nobuts, no exceptions, that’s it.’ The existence of one Infinite Consciousness isthe only truth; everything else is the imagination of that Consciousness –illusion. I should also define ‘Love’ as used in this book. It’s not the, ‘Ilove you darlin’, fancy a quick one?’ version, or any other misrepresentationsalong the same lines. Love in the context of Infinite Love is the balance ofall. Infinite ‘Love’ is also Infinite Intelligence, Infinite Knowing, InfiniteEverything. Thus, it is and it isn’t; it is everywhere and nowhere, everythingand nothing. It is All Possibility in perfect balance.The ‘voice’ spoke to me for some five hours and another veil lifted for me thatnight. I have begun to understand new levels of the game thanks to what Ilearned in the ayahuasca experience, the ever-expanding insights that havefollowed, the knowledge given to me by the synchronicity in my life and,increasingly, the way I am seeing through the ‘solid’ world of illusion. Thesenew levels are centres of awareness, control and manipulation from which the‘Reptilians’ and ‘Illuminati’ are made manifest. Throughout the rest of the bookI am going to describe reality as I have come to understand it from all thesesources of information and insight. Much of it is supportable by evidenceemerging at the forefront of science, especially what is known as quantumphysics. But I go further than that and so much will not be ‘provable’ in thesense that the human mind demands proof and people will have to decide forthemselves what they think or, better still, know about what they read. It isnot my desire to convince anyone that this is true or to tell them what theirreality should be; the Matrix does that well enough already without any helpfrom me. So, here we go: the illusory wool that has been pulled over ourillusory eyes.Oneness is Infinite Possibility with a limitless imagination to manifestanything and everything. This ‘physical’ world is only one example. Given this,how silly it is to dismiss by reflex action the accounts of shape-shiftingReptilians and other nonhuman entities just because they are so different towhat is perceived as the ‘norm’. There is no norm within Infinite Possibilityand such myopia is indicative of just how caught-in-the-box most people are. Asa car sticker I saw in California said: ‘You laugh at me because I’m different;I laugh at you because you’re all the same’. Seven months after the experiencein Brazil, I came across an ancient Hindu myth. It said human consciousness hadbegun as a ripple that decided to leave the ocean of consciousness – the‘timeless, spaceless and eternal’. When it awakened to itself in this‘disconnected’ state, the myth said, it forgot that it was part of the infiniteocean and felt isolated and separated. This was pretty much what the voice toldme in another way. I am constrained by the use of words because feeling orknowing something is much more profound than describing it in language. But,basically, the imagination of Oneness created an illusory realm, one of infinitesuch ‘worlds’ within Infinite Possibility. This ‘world’ began to forget it wasOneness, like a dream forgetting it is the dreamer. With this amnesia came thephenomenon we call fear, an expression of All Possibility that cannot manifestwithin the balance of Oneness. Fear only comes with the illusion of division andseparation when consciousness perceives itself as a part and not the whole. Fearis the shadow of illusory disconnection.image [../Images/00026.jpg]Figure 21image [../Images/00027.jpg]Figure 22image [../Images/00028.jpg]Figure 23The creation of the Matrix, as symbolised by Neil Hague. First came imaginationinto ‘form’; with that came the illusion of separation; this led to themanifestation of fear (the winged entity) that took on a life of its own; andconsciousness was caught in an illusion it believed to be ‘real’.As a Hindu myth says, human consciousness began as a ripple that decided toleave the ocean of consciousness – the timeless, spaceless and eternal. When itawakened to itself in this ‘disconnected’ state, it forgot that it was part ofthe infinite ocean and felt isolated and separated.Neil Hague’s superb pictures (see colour section) symbolise the progression fromOneness to division and fear (Figures 21 to 26). First came imagination into‘form’; then the illusion of separation, which was followed by the manifestationof fear that took on a life of its own. The creation of the Matrix Dreamworldwas not good or bad, right or wrong. It just was. It’s not the structure of theMatrix that is the problem so much as the force that controls it. The ‘Matrix’is a virtual reality illusion hijacked by fear and so is empowered by fear. Thevoice in Brazil said that when people are in fear they find comfort in thefamiliar and predictable and this had happened in the Matrix. It was a way forconsciousness to whistle in the dark, giving itself comfort in the familiarbecause it feared what lay beyond. I guess you could think of it as like a lostchild disconnected from its mum and dad. What is humanity’s biggest fear in itsdaily experience? Fear of the unknown. Wilson Bryan Key described the humanattitude to the unknown very well in The Age of Manipulation (Madison Books,USA, 1989):> ‘Humans detest uncertainty. Uncertainties produce anxieties. To reduce> anxiety, if no factual structure is readily available, humans will simply> invent one or accept a ready-to-wear media reality structure … these> perceptions, of course, are fictional constructs.’ image [../Images/00029.jpg]Figure 24image [../Images/00030.jpg]Figure 25image [../Images/00031.jpg]Figure 26The Matrix is just that, a fictional construct of collective mind. This‘physical’ level of the Matrix, what I call the Time Loop, was created toprovide familiarity that eased the fear of the unknown caused by illusoryseparation and was a very much more pleasant experience than it is in ourreality. You could think of the Matrix as a thought projection, like a movieprojecting on a cinema screen. The projection was dependent for its survival onthe projector. But the projection, the act of imagination, took on a ‘life’ ofits own when it gained access to its own source of energy. This source, thevoice told me, was fear. Now it was that the dream took over the dreamer. TheMatrix – self-aware fear as the voice described it – developed an agenda of itsown and sought to generate as much fear as possible to empower and expanditself. The reason the Matrix needs fear as an energy source is because it isfear. The more fear its manipulations generate through wars, conflict, stress,guilt and aggression, the greater its power to increase this cycle offear-production. As the voice was describing all this, I was shown scenes fromthe Disney cartoon movie, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, in which the sorcerercreated an entity to do all the jobs he didn’t want to do, but then the entitytook over and became the sorcerer’s controller. The story of Frankenstein isalso very symbolic of what happened. Entrapped consciousness became controlledby its own fear in a labyrinth of self-deceit and manipulated illusion (Figure27).(I should explain how I am defining consciousness for the purposes of this book.Everything is consciousness, but there are different levels of awarenessdepending on how connected something is to Infinite Oneness. To compare theconsciousness of Oneness in awareness of itself with what we call human ‘mind’is to compare Einstein with a baked bean. Indeed, the difference is so fantasticthat there is no comparison. So when I speak of consciousness in this book Imean awareness beyond mind, beyond the Matrix.)When we forget that we are Infinite Consciousness experiencing an illusion,everything else loses perspective. I was on a catamaran ferry one afternoon withmy son, Jaymie, making the 15-minute crossing from mainland England to our homeon the Isle of Wight. As we left the harbour, a mist descended which denied ussight of land in any direction. Normally, the ferry follows the mainland coastfor a few minutes and then turns sharp right and heads for the Island.Independently of each other, both Jaymie and I began to wonder why we were notturning this time. We passed one of the big concrete ‘forts’ in the water which,even when the tide is low and the ferry takes the long way round, is the lastpoint at which the turn is made. But it still appeared to both of us that wewere continuing to go straight ahead and away from the Island. Just as we werewondering what on earth was happening, the lights of the Island pier came intoview and we realised that we had been going in the right direction all along. Wehad become disorientated (‘lost’) by losing the key coordinate – sight of land.With that it would have been obvious what was happening and the direction wewere taking. But once that had gone, all other coordinates, like the fort, lostperspective. We had actually turned at the fort but, without having the land forreference, that wasn’t obvious. This is what happens to us in the Matrix. Oncewe lose sight of the foundation coordinate – we are Infinite Consciousnessexperiencing an illusion – we lose the point of reference from which tounderstand everything else. We think we are going in a certain direction (thatwe are humans in ‘real’ bodies experiencing a ‘real’ world) when, in fact, it’sall a manipulated dream. One other point is that both Jaymie and I were caughtin the same illusion and this meant that we were confirming each other’s realityand making it more ‘real’. So it is with humanity – ‘everyone knows that’!image [../Images/00032.jpg]Figure 27: The virtual-reality game: entrapped consciousness, in a state ofcollective amnesia, became controlled by its own fear in a labyrinth ofself-deceit and manipulated illusion that I call the Matriximage [../Images/00033.jpg]Figure 28: Holograms are made by using two parts of the same laser light. Onehalf (reference beam) goes almost directly to the photographic plate and theother (working beam) is diverted onto the subject. When this working beam isdiverted again onto the print it forms an “interference pattern” with thereference beam. If a laser is shone upon this pattern it creates a 3-Dholographic picture of the subjectimage [../Images/00034.jpg]Figure 29: The wave or ‘interference’ pattern on a holographic print. It seemsrandom and meaningless until a laser light is shone on the pattern and ahologram is formed.The Frankenstein Matrix is a super-hologram that feeds us the dreamworld. DennisGabor discovered holograms from the late 1940s and won the Nobel Prize for hiswork. He turned a three-dimensional object into a frequency pattern onphotographic film and converted it back to a 3D holographic image. Holograms aremade by directing a laser onto a piece of photographic film (Figure 28). Thelaser is directed at the film through a semi-transparent mirror. Some of thelight is deflected away in another direction and onto the object you want tophotograph. Now you have the laser light pointing at the film (known as thereference beam) and the part deflected away onto the object (known as theworking beam). This working beam, carrying the vibrational image of the objectin question, is then also directed onto the photographic film. When it hits thefilm it ‘collides’ with the reference beam – its ‘other half’ – and this createswhat is known as an interference pattern between the two. You can liken theprinciple to throwing two stones into a pond and seeing how the two waveformations collide and interfere with each other. They form a pattern that is awave representation of the two stones, where they fell and at what speed. Theinterference pattern imprinted on the holographic film looks much like the wavesin the pond. It is a series of lines that appear to be random andincomprehensible (Figure 29). But when you shine the same type of laser lightupon this pattern, suddenly an apparently three-dimensional image of thephotographed object comes into view (Figures 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34). The imagescan appear to be solid, but you can pass your hand through them; and immediatelyyou turn off the light the hologram disappears because it is only an illusion.Lasers are used because they produce a stable, focused beam known as ‘coherentlight’ and project a single frequency. Coherent light is that which holds anarrow, even beam over long distances and does not expand and weaken like thelight from a torch.image [../Images/00035.jpg]image [../Images/00036.jpg]Figures 30 and 31: This girl and soldier look ‘real’ and ‘solid’, but you arelooking at holograms that you could pass your hand through. It’s the same withthe human body – its ‘solidity’ is an illusion(Pictures ‘Little Birch’ and ‘Old Soldier’ courtesy of Holography Studio,All-Russian Exhibition Center, Moscow. For more see www.holography.ru[http://www.holography.ru])The Matrix, the virtualreality game, is a super-hologram projecting endlessother holograms, including the human body and, they are all, by their verynature, illusions (Figure 35). One of the amazing characteristics of a hologramis that every part is a smaller version of the whole. No matter how much you maycut the film into smaller and smaller pieces, when you shine the laser on themthey will all give you a smaller whole picture. If you cut a normal photo intofour pieces each of them will obviously contain a quarter of the entire image,but not with the hologram. Any part of the film will always give you a smallerversion of the whole. The human body is, therefore, a smaller version of theentire Matrix hologram and I suppose you could say the Matrix made ‘man’ in itsown image. This means that because the human body hologram has a brain, whichcommunicates to all parts of the body and decodes the information coming back,so the Matrix as a whole must have a version of this. It communicates to its‘cells’ (human bodies and other life forms) and processes the information itreceives from them. This is how we receive our collective reality and alsochange it through the signals we unconsciously send back to the Matrix ‘brain’ –the central computer (Figure 36 overleaf).image [../Images/00037.jpg]Figure 32: What can appear to be so solid is not – this is another hologram …image [../Images/00038.jpg]Figure 33: … So is this, a ‘solid’ metal tap …image [../Images/00039.jpg]Figure 34: Sleight of hand … holographic hands you couldn’t hold – unless yourbrain told you different!Picture ‘Medina’ courtesy of Laser Trend Holographie, Germany.

For more see www.holography.ru [http://www.holography.ru]Every part of the body is a smaller version of the whole body and this is whyevery cell contains all the information necessary to create an entire humanform. I’ll explore the health implications of this later as it solves manyscientific ‘mysteries’. Mainstream science has been unable to locate the area ofthe brain that contains all the memory because what we call memory existsthroughout the brain and body. This must be the case because it’s a hologram.People with tumours, who have large parts of their brains removed, do not losespecific memories. They might not remember, in general, quite as well becausethey have moved to a smaller level of the holographic memory where there is lessclarity than in the whole. But they don’t lose one memory completely and retainanother in crystal clarity as they would if memory was located in one area. Thebody hologram stores information from all the senses and so when we smellsomething it can trigger a memory just as powerfully as sight or hearing. Eventhis is another level of the illusion because if the brain is a hologram it mustalso be illusory. It is, like everything in this reality, the ‘physical’expression of a frequency field or resonance. Incidentally, the holographicnature of the body means the whole brain/body is involved in decoding the fivesenses and not just the ‘visual cortex’ and other areas of the brain associatedwith these specific duties.This is a perfect time to describe the structure controlling our reality becausewe have computers, the Internet, holographic photography and television, whichmirror the Matrix in so many ways. But I stress that when I say the Matrix islike a computer or software program I am only using this term to symbolise thetheme of what I mean because today’s computer technology helps me to describethese concepts. When it comes to the Matrix, even the most fantastic of today’scomputers and software is like comparing roller skates with the space shuttle,and even that gap does not tell the full story. By the way, if you know nothingabout computers, and we tend to assume that everyone is aware of this stuff now,software is a set of electronic instructions that the computer reads andresponds to. Another bonus in describing our illusory world is the Matrixmovies, which have provided a brilliant visual representation of the virtualreality we are experiencing. I couldn’t believe it when the first one came outbecause it has been such a great tool in communicating what I was trying toexplain with only words before. Without this, and the computer technologies, itwould be hard to know where to start in describing the workings of the Matrix,but with them it’s so much easier.image [../Images/00040.jpg]Figure 35: Our bones seem so ‘solid’ and surely our bodies must be ‘physical’and ‘real’?

Inturn, human brains are giving feedback to the Matrix and this two-way loop leadsto changes that we call ‘Evolution’. It’s like rewriting a computer program andthis is how consciousness can regain control of the MatrixWe are ‘living’ in a highly sophisticated version of a virtual-reality game or,put another way, a holographic Internet giving the illusion of 3D. One of thebig questions people ask is why, if we are creating our own illusory reality, dowe all see the same basic world in street scenes, people, cars, roads, forestsand mountains? The answer is that we are being fed frequency signals by theforce manipulating the Matrix and we decode them into the collective reality wecall the world (Figure 37). We add our own spin to this in that we differ in ouropinions of what we collectively ‘see’; but we all share the same basic realitybecause we are decoding the same signals from the Matrix. This reality is notout there, it is ‘in here’ – inside our heads. Or, more accurately, it is in ourgenetic data bank, DNA. As the writer Edgar Allan Poe put it: ‘All we see andseem is but a dream within a dream’ … a hologram within a hologram.image [../Images/00042.jpg]Figure 37: We are constantly receiving a collective reality in waveform from theMatrix and we decode these frequencies into an illusory 3D holographic reality.You could see it as like holographic television in which the pictures broadcastas waveforms from the transmitter are decoded into moving images by the TVIn the late summer of 2004, I met a friend, Mike Lambert, from the Shen Clinicon the Isle of Wight in England. Mike is a healer forever pushing back theboundaries of his profession in pursuit of greater understanding. As usual, thishas not made him popular with the medical authorities and even those who seek todictate the norms within so-called alternative or complementary therapies. Ihave yet to see a hierarchy of any kind that did not act out the samecharacteristics of control of events and defence of the status quo. What thehierarchy represents is irrelevant; it is the fact that it is a hierarchy thatcreates the replicated mindset. Even anti-hierarchy hierarchies behave the same– see the ‘radical’ and anarchist organisations for confirmation. ‘Right, order,order, your anarchist committee has decided what the rules will be.’ To see thisattitude controlling the alternative-therapy arena is sickening. Anyway, in the1980s Mike Lambert wrote a paper well ahead of its time about DNA ordeoxyribonucleic acid. This is the body’s genetic library found in every celland we all have some 120 billion miles of the stuff. It is DNA that carries thecodes for our physical characteristics, but it is far more than that. Itcontains in excess of a hundred trillion times more information than our mostsophisticated storage devices. The known DNA codes represent roughly only threeto five per cent of the mapped human genome and the other 95 to 97 per cent isnot yet understood by conventional science.* Mike showed me a summary of what hehad written all those years before and, as I scanned the paper, two things hitme like a smack on the head:> 1)The DNA of all life, everything from a human being to a reptile, cat, dog,> tree, flower, fish, insect, everything, shares the same codes known as A, G,> C, and T (adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine).> 2)DNA is a crystalline structure and a receiver, transmitter and amplifier of> frequencies or ‘light’.image [../Images/00043.jpg]Figure 38: The double-ladder helix of DNA, the crystalline receiver, transmitterand amplifier of frequencies or ‘light’, that connects us to the Matrix. DNA isthe software program that contains our genetic data and what we call mind andemotionsimage [../Images/00044.jpg]Figure 39: DNA can be expressed as a series of letter codes in sequences of A,G, C and T. How these are arranged decides the nature of the ‘physical’ form.Remind you of the codes in the Matrix movies?Holy shit, I thought. This is it! This is how they do it – this is what plugs usinto the Matrix. It’s the DNA! When you look at the graphic of DNA structure itis a double helix which, when unravelled, looks like two ladders (Figure 38),although some researchers believe there were once many more. The windingstairway in Freemasonic symbolism relates to DNA because it is the key to humancontrol and the same symbol can be found in the secret mystery schools of theancient world. The sequences of A, G, C and T decide the geneticcharacteristics, what your body looks like or whether the form is a mouse,elephant or daffodil (Figure 39), and there is another player in this that I’llcome to shortly. The DNA differences between species are far less than theirsimilarities. Ninety per cent of the DNA in humans and mice is the same andthere are enormous parallels between human DNA and that of a housefly. As anarticle in the San Francisco Chronicle said: ‘… DNA is a universal softwarecode. From bacteria to humans, the basic instructions for life are written withthe same language’. And this language is the language of the Matrix.image [../Images/00045.jpg]Figure 40: DNA has a reptilian feel about it when massively magnifiedimage [../Images/00046.jpg]Figure 41: The ancient double helix snake image known today as the caduceus, asymbol for DNA and, appropriately, today’s medical professionIf you saw DNA massively magnified it would look like a snake (Figure 40) and,not by coincidence, a major symbol throughout the ancient world was the doublehelix snake image known today as the caduceus (Figure 41). This is the symbol ofthe medical profession. DNA, the foundation of ‘physical’ form, has areptilian-like appearance and the most ancient part of the human brain is knownas the R-complex or reptilian brain. I’ll come to how the Reptilians andIlluminati fit into all this in the next chapter. What we think of as ‘physical’is actually a holographic illusion, and the base form of DNA, as witheverything, is a frequency field, a sort of floppy disk or CD holding thegenetic program. We need to think in computer terms to understand most simplyhow it all works.When we procreate we see the physical expression of this with sperm from thefather fusing with an egg from the mother, and the baby developing from thisunion. But on an energy level, beyond the holographic appearance of 3D, it istwo ‘software programs’ being copied onto another disk. The DNA of father andmother are downloaded and the result is a ‘disk’ or program containing a fusionof both – the baby. This is how genetic characteristics and defects are passedon. A download containing a computer virus or flaw will be passed on to the new‘disk’, the ‘next generation’. The body is created from one fertilised egg(program) and this is copied over and over until the adult human has between 50and 100 trillion cells. Each one contains the same library of instructions thatare read according to their function, just as a computer reads software.The reader of the body software is called RNA, or ribonucleic acid, which isusually found in the form of a single strand. To keep it simple, the DNA is likethe disk or template and the RNA is like the laser that reads the information onthe disk and communicates it to the cells (Figure 42). The RNA decides cellfunction by which information it chooses to transcribe from the DNA and deliverto a cell. Transcribe one set of DNA data or ‘language’ and it’s a brain cell;select another sequence and it’s a cell in the liver. One part of the RNAdecodes the DNA information and another decides which information to decode. Theunderstanding of RNA – how it works and what makes its decoding decisions – isstill far from fully understood by mainstream science. But here is anothermassive key to the creation of reality. These RNA decisions can be made by theMatrix via the DNA or through the intervention of consciousness to override thebody program. They are also affected by mental and emotional influences likestress and trauma, and electromagnetic and chemical pollution, includingadditives in our food and drink. These can destabilise the RNA reading processand cause translation mistakes that lead to disease.image [../Images/00047.jpg]Figure 42: The RNA ‘laser’ reads the DNA ‘software’ and passes the informationto the cells. Which part of the DNA ‘disk’ it chooses to read and communicate iscontrolled by the force controlling the RNA – the program or consciousness,depending on our state of awareness and connectionAll of these factors, and more, can affect how the RNA reads the DNA and this isfundamental to both physical and mental health, and our sense of reality. Thisis important to understand because, while the DNA stores the data, it is the RNAthat chooses which data to select and manifest. The computer may have the harddisk, but the computer operator decides which information on the disk toactivate and use. RNA is the laser reader deciding which sense of reality wewill experience – as with the example of the hypnotised Tom who could not seehis daughter. The RNA read his reality through the DNA in line with hisprogrammed belief that she was not in the room. How the RNA reads the DNA alsodecides our physical and mental health. It can decide to read a genetic flaw orignore it. So from now on when I talk about DNA or the DNA network, I amincluding in these terms the work of the RNA and its choices of what totranscribe and communicate.Incidentally, it is said that ‘practice makes perfect’ and this is true becausethe mind/body is like a computer reading software. When a soccer playerpractices a skill over and over the resulting data is downloaded onto the ‘disk’and can be accessed later when he’s playing a match. As the ball comes to him ina certain situation, the ‘computer’ will react according to downloaded data.Practice well and you perform well, and vice versa. When I am coaching my son,Jaymie, at goalkeeping, I always say practice as you’d like to play because thecomputer doesn’t distinguish between practice and match – it just reacts to theinput it has recorded for a given situation. It’s the same with any skill youwant to develop although, no matter how much you practice, some will be have agreater ‘natural’ aptitude for certain things than others because of the baseprogram they have ‘inherited’ in the first place.What struck me most about Mike Lambert’s paper was the relationship between DNAand the receiving and communication of information. DNA, he pointed out, was acrystal that emitted light energy in the form of photons to such an extent thatit had been compared, by some, to an ‘ultra weak laser’ (the same with RNA). Thecutting edge of scientific research is beginning to understand that DNA is aperfect antenna/transmitter. One Internet article said:> ‘From the characteristic form of this giant molecule - a wound double helix -> the DNA represents an ideal electromagnetic antenna. On one hand it is> elongated and thus a blade antenna, which can take up very well electrical> pulses. On the other hand, seen from above, it has the form of a ring and thus> is a very good magnetical antenna.’ It is through this receiver/transmitter that we are connected to the Matrix. Ihave been saying and writing for two years that our reality was like aholographic Internet. Our bodies are akin to computers connected to the WorldWide Web (Figure 43 overleaf). The computer can travel through the collectivereality that we call the Internet, visiting a news site, sports site,environmental site, porn site, whatever. It can also communicate with othercomputers via the Web through what we call e-mail and networking, when computerslink up and work together. All the computers in the world connected to theInternet share the same collective reality, the same matrix. Humans also share acollective reality and we can surf our illusory web of holographic countries,people and interests. We can follow the news (news site), play sports (sportssite), work for environmental groups (environmental site) or seek to roger everyman or woman that takes our fancy (porn site). The principle is exactly thesame. Our collective ‘physical’ reality is a like a holographic Internet and ourbodies are biological computers. We understand how the World Wide Web isconstructed through telephone lines and cable networks, but I wanted to know howour collective reality was generated. When I read the line about DNA being acrystal communicator and receiver of laser-type light, I had my answer. TheMatrix was unveiled.image [../Images/00048.jpg]Figure 43: Our brains and DNA/RNA are like computer terminals receiving andtransmitting data. This information is exchanged with the Matrix brain and withother people and life forms. We are operating in a holographic version of theInternetInsights began to flood my mind as this realisation developed. The DNA was, ineffect, the computer terminal through which we logged into the Matrix and werefed its collective reality – the illusions that hold us in slavery. Einsteinsaid: ‘Reality is an illusion, albeit a persistent one’. The persistent bit isthe virtual-reality game transmitted by the Matrix super-hologram to the bodyhologram via DNA. The RNA then decides which of the program to read and manifestas ‘reality’, a decision made through a combination of programming, mental andemotional state, belief, and, for those who are awakening – consciousness. I hadlong said that most people were controlled in their thoughts, responses andreactions by the genetic traits of their bodies, the software program that weinherit from our parents and the genetic line. I saw the body as a bucking horsethat our consciousness had to subdue and harmonise by expressing its realityover that inherited genetically, or through society’s programming, by the bodyor ‘horse’. I felt that the ‘horse’ (DNA) was in control of their actions andreactions, and not the ‘rider’ (consciousness experiencing this world throughthe body). In such people, an inherited genetic trait like alcoholism would berepeated in their own experience while those with consciousness more powerfulthan the DNA programming would be able to override it and avoid the repetition(the RNA decides to read the program differently from the alcoholic parent).DNA/RNA is like a computer reacting to the data it receives. This data can comefrom the Matrix, our consciousness, or through programs affecting otherprograms. The latter includes the way human society is manipulated to programthe people with a false reality. I recalled in Tales from the Time Loop how Iwas walking in an altered state on the only other occasion I have triedpsychoactive substances, in this case ‘magic mushrooms’. The voice was talkingto me again as I came across a horsebox parked in the street with a horse andrider alongside. The voice said that the analogy of the horse and rider – bodyand consciousness – was valid. Imagine, it said, that the ‘incoming’consciousness has to cope with all those inherited programs, beliefs, andassumptions of reality carried in the DNA. It said: ‘Do you wonder any longerwhy people are so easy to manipulate when they inherit that genetic programmingto start with?’ Most people expended so much energy coping with the inheritedresponses, reactions, desires and demands of their DNA that they had little leftto look up and see beyond the illusion. The DNA is decoding the signals from theMatrix into a holographic illusory world and it also connects with the DNA ofother people and life forms to create the human collective mind. Thisholographic Internet – the Matrix – is what we call ‘Creation’.It is not only inherited genetic software that is held in our DNA. This iscontinually being added to and rewritten by the messages it is receiving fromthe Matrix, consciousness and the programming of ‘society’. This is what iscalled ‘evolution’! For example, it is the brain/DNA and its information loopwith the Matrix central computer that leads to changes in animals to match theirchanging environments and circumstances. In the Beginning was the Word –Microsoft Word – and the story is constantly changing in response to theinformation sent and received by the Matrix and other sources. The DNA/RNA is abiological computer, reading interactive software programs in the same way thatthe crystalline brain decodes electrical signals from the senses and turns theminto sight, sound, smell, taste and touch – the illusory holographic world thatexists only in our heads. The brain is to the body what the central processingunit, or CPU, is to a computer. The central processing unit, or centralprocessor, is responsible for controlling and reading all communications trafficand it is the most important part of the computer system. One explanation of theCPU I saw actually called it the ‘brain of a computer’ and the human brain isthe CPU of the body computer. The healing art of acupuncture is based on thelines of energy flowing around the body called meridians. In Figure 44(overleaf), you can see the meridian system picked out by a gamma camera afterradioactive tracers had been injected into acupuncture points. This is acomputer-enhanced version of an image produced in a study at the Necker Hospitalin Paris held in conjunction with the Cytology Laboratory at the MilitaryHospital. I know what the meridians remind me of – a circuit board. This energy,known as chi in acupuncture, consists of photons carrying information around thebody computer under the guidance of the central processing unit, the brain. Thechakra system also connects into this network.After I had written this chapter I came across research at the University ofFlorida that confirmed still further the ‘computer’ nature of DNA. They grew a‘brain’ in a laboratory from 25,000 neural cells extracted from a single ratembryo and taught it to fly an F-22 jet simulator! It was part of a researchproject to develop a new breed of ‘living’ computer that has the ability to‘think’. It is possible for rat cells to fly a jet plane in the same way thatyou download software on to a computer. The neurons were immersed in aspecialised liquid suspension to keep them alive and laid across a grid of 60electrodes in a small glass dish. Under the microscope they looked, at first,like thousands of grains of sand, but soon the cells began to connect to formwhat scientists are calling a ‘live computation device’, or ‘brain’. It waslinked up to the jet simulator and, via a desktop computer, it was taught tocontrol the plane, even in hurricane-force winds. Dr Thomas DeMarse, one of thescientists involved, said:> ‘When we first hooked them up, the plane “crashed” all the time, but … the> neural network slowly adapts as the brain learns to control the pitch and roll> of the aircraft. After a while, it produces a nice straight and level> trajectory. The network receives the information about the aircraft’s pitch> and roll in the form of stimulation pulses and its responses change over time.> We are its external teachers as it learns.’ image [../Images/00049.jpg]Figure 44: A computer-enhanced image of the meridian system picked out by agamma camera after radioactive tracers had been injected into acupuncturepoints. This is the body computer’s circuit board. The energy flowing throughthe meridians, known as chi in acupuncture, consists of photons carryinginformation around the body. The chakra system also connects with this networkand when the flow of energy (information) is blocked or suppressed it manifestsas illness or dis-ease. Acupuncture needles are used to keep the energy flowingand balanced – and thus the body healthyThis is what is happening every day to humans. Our DNA computer cells aredownloading data from the Matrix and ‘society’, and they are taught to respondaccording to program, just like the rat cells with the simulator. The only wayto override this DNA programming is through the intervention of consciousness.When we do this, the resonance of the body hologram increases with the spinspeed of the particles as they respond to the higher consciousness we areaccessing. Consciousness then dictates events through the DNA and not thelow-vibrational program. Incidentally, the development of biological computersthat can ‘think’ is a dangerous road and the potential consequences weresuperbly portrayed in the Matrix movies when the world was taken over bymachines that could think. (Indeed, has it already happened?) The takeover bythe biological computer machines in those movies mirrors the way the Matrix hasbeen hijacked by self-aware fear.Messages are constantly being passed between the DNA computers of people,animals and all life, and this is a further extension and expression of theMatrix. This is how we can communicate without words with animals, trees andflowers, as experiments have shown, and how we pick up good or bad ‘vibes’ frompeople no matter what their outward demeanour might be. It is a bit like sendingvibratory DNA e-mails, I guess, or ‘d’-mails, you might say. You have d-mail –the guy across the room is a con man. ‘Hey, Ethel, I get bad vibes from that guyacross the room.’ These DNA computer-terminal connections are what we call thecollective mind or, as the Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, termed it, the‘collective unconscious’.I have written many times about the so-called ‘hundredth monkey’ syndrome. Thiswas the discovery that when a few members of a species are taught something new,suddenly all, or most, of the species begin to do the same instinctively withoutbeing shown. They may tell us this phenomenon is mysterious, but it’s verysimple, even more so as we understand the nature of the DNA ‘Internet’. Themonkeys, or whatever species, communicate the new knowledge via their DNA by thevery act of learning and realisation. It is like finding new information andposting it on the Web to make it available to everyone logged on. In this case,the ‘everyone’ is the rest of the species operating with the same DNA codes andthe same broadcast frequency. This is how all species communicate, and why theydo so more efficiently with each other than with other species. They share thesame DNA codes and transmit and receive on the same wavelength. This happensbetween the human species, too, and the system seeks to keep us divided toundermine the power of the collective unconscious to rewrite reality.As I mentioned, we have 120 billion miles of DNA and our bodies are monumentalcomputer terminals that can process unbelievable amounts of information bothcoming in and going out. In fact, more than enough for us to receive and holdmanifest the collective illusion we call the world, or the cosmos. The Matrixcontrols consciousness trapped within its vibratory walls by holding it in afalse reality that it believes to be real. This is done by constantlybroadcasting a ‘world’ as frequency, or wave, fields to the DNA computerterminals and the DNA, through the brain/RNA, decoding these broadcasts into theholographic form that we call the physical, or five-sense, universe. Someresearchers say that the synapses, which communicate information between nervecells in the brain, are fundamentally involved in this process. The principle issimilar to television, which decodes frequencies, or waveforms, broadcast from atransmitter into pictures on the screen. The only real difference is thatDNA/RNA does this holographically to give the illusion of 3D – althoughholographic television is already being talked about.It was the discoveries of the Frenchman Jean B. J. Fourier in the 18th centurythat led to both television and the discovery of holograms. He developed aprocess called Fourier transform, a mathematical method of converting patternsinto simple waveforms and back again, so providing the potential for atelevision camera to convert pictures into electromagnetic frequencies and thetelevision to convert them back again. Scientists have discovered that the humanbrain operates on the principles of Fourier transform – it is a frequencydecoder. Precisely! At the end of the 1970s, research by Russell and KarenDeValois, two neurophysiologists at Berkeley University, revealed compellingevidence, since supported by countless other scientists across the world, thatthe brain is decoding frequency patterns and turning them into holographicimages that we ‘see’ (or think we do). The brain cells in the visual cortexreact to different frequency patterns and activate according to the types offrequency they receive. I would suggest that it is decoding the frequencysignals, the waveforms broadcast by the Matrix, into the illusory holograms ofthe ‘physical’ world, although I would say the whole brain is involved in thisand not just the visual cortex. Indeed, it involves more than even the brain.The entire body, all 120 billion miles of DNA (along with RNA), is involved inthe decoding process. For well over a century it has been known that the ear isa frequency decoder, and experiments by Georg von Bekesy, another Nobel Prizewinner, have long confirmed that the skin responds to frequencies. The voice inBrazil told me that all five senses are frequency decoders and now we can seewhy – the decoder is the brain and the DNA/RNA operating in every cell.As I said earlier, DNA (like RNA) emits light-energy in the form of photons tosuch an extent that it has been compared by some to an ‘ultra weak laser’. Theygenerate coherent light in the same way that our technological lasers do – thelasers that create holograms. The Matrix broadcasts its signals in wave, orinterference, patterns and it may be that the laser light emitted by the DNA/RNAis part of the process of turning them into holographic representations of thatwaveform – people, animals, houses, streets, forests and landscapes. This is thecomputer-game scene that I increasingly see as I walk or drive around. Onemystery of quantum physics is how particles can either express themselves as a‘wave’ form (non-physical) or as a particle (apparently ‘physical’) and thewaveforms only become particles when they are being observed – when we arelooking at them. What is actually happening is that the DNA/RNA/brain is causingthe waveform or interference pattern to project an illusory hologram. The act of‘observation’ – focus – projects the holograms from the waveforms and when thishappens the quantum physicists see the waveform ‘becoming’ a particle. Both thewaveform and the particle (waveform observed as a hologram by the DNA/RNA/brain)exist at the same time and they don’t move from one state to another. When alaser is shone onto a photographic interference pattern to manifest a hologram,one does not replace the other. Both waveform and hologram (particles) coexist.It is just that the observer sees the hologram as the prime reality. Thewaveform is possibility; the particle is ‘physical’ experience. Karl Pribram, aneurophysiologist at Stanford University, has been at the forefront ofunderstanding the holographic nature of physical reality. Michael Talbot writesof his conclusions in the Holographic Universe:> ‘… [Karl] Pribram [realised] that the objective world does not exist, at least> not in the way we are accustomed to believing. What is ‘out there’ is a vast> ocean of waves and frequencies and reality looks concrete to us only because> our brains are able to take this holographic blur and convert it into sticks> and stones and other familiar objects that make up our world … > ‘… In other words, the smoothness of a piece of fine china and the feel of> beach sand beneath our feet are really just elaborate versions of the phantom> limb syndrome [when amputees “feel” a limb long after it has been removed]. > ‘According to Pribram, this does not mean there aren’t china cups and grains> of beach sand out there. It simply means that a china cup has two very> different aspects to its reality. When it is filtered through the lens of our> brains it manifests as a cup. But if we could get rid of our lenses, we’d> experience it as an interference pattern. Which is real and which is illusion?> “Both are real to me,” says Pribram, “or, if you want to say, neither of them> are real.”‘ I know that conventional scientists will mock the idea that the laser emittedfrom DNA/RNA is powerful enough to be involved in the manifestation ofholograms, including its own ‘body’. DNA is claimed to have the laser power ofonly a single candle, but there are two points to make about that. Firstly, theDNA laser is coherent light, focused and concentrated, as opposed to a candle,which diffuses its light and power; secondly, the DNA laser is far more powerfulthan a single candle, as science will eventually discover. The ability tomeasure something is dependent on the advancement of the technology used to doit. Try measuring the accuracy of the most advanced computer withcounting-beads. The true power of DNA/RNA operates on frequencies that humantechnology cannot yet measure and in ways it does not understand. If your radiodial is not properly tuned to a station it can sound weak, quiet and fuzzy, buthit the right frequency and the same station could blow your ears off.Science may think it is advanced in its knowledge of DNA, how it works, and thepower of its laser emissions, but, compared with what there is to know,mainstream science is still hunting mammoths and going ‘Ug, ug’. Let’s get thisstraight here. Scientists understand, or think they do, only some three to fiveper cent of our DNA. The other 95 to 97 per cent they basically know bugger allabout. So how can they pontificate on what DNA can and can’t do – the same withRNA? They call this other up to 97 per cent ‘junk DNA’, as if it doesn’t doanything of significance. Let me go through that again in case you missed it oryou’re still trying to lift your jaw from the floor. They call this other up to97 per cent ‘junk DNA’ as if it doesn’t do anything of significance. What is itthere for, then? Was ‘God’ taking the piss? ‘Science’ refuses to see theelephant in the living room no matter how much it may dump on the carpet – theofficial version of reality (Figure 45). In fact, the more it dumps the moreestablishment ‘scientists’ hold their noses, cover their ears and stare at thefloor. For example, get this professor. Do you think that by any chance thesemight be related??image [../Images/00050.jpg]Figure 45: ‘Elephant? What elephant?’‘I trained at Harvard and Oxford and if there was an elephant in this room Iwould be the first to see it’.> •We cannot perceive, even with technology, at least 95 per cent of the mass in> the universe known as dark energy and matter, and what we ‘see’ with our eyes> is a minuscule fraction of what exists.> •95 per cent of the brain’s activity does not relate to the waking state or> ‘physical reality’.> •Scientists call some 95 to 97 per cent of DNA ‘junk DNA’ because they don’t> know what it does.Now, the figures may be approximate, but do you think it could just be that this95 per cent or so of ‘junk’ DNA, and 95 per cent of brain activity not involvedwith the waking state, could relate to the 95 per cent (plus) of energy/matterthat we can’t perceive? And that it could be connecting us to levels ofawareness that operate outside the realm of visible electromagnetic light, assymbolised in Figure 46?Hey, I just saw this big grey thing with a long nose sitting on the couch – didyou see that?image [../Images/00051.jpg]Figure 46: The 95 per cent of ‘junk’ DNA, 95 per cent of brain activity notinvolved with the waking state, and at least much of the enormous brain capacitythat science says we don’t use, are actually connecting us (or should be) withthe 95 per cent of energy/matter in the universe that we can’t see – and also torealms beyond thatThis is a wonderful example of how mainstream science ignores, discards ordismisses anything that undermines its assumptions. It reaches the conclusionfirst and makes the ‘evidence’ fit. So much is being received, transmitted andprocessed by DNA that we are not aware of because ‘scientific’ research islimited to the frequency range its instruments can measure. Outside that (tiny)range they’re basically fucked. There is no ‘junk’ DNA; it all has a purpose andthat’s up to 97 per cent more purpose (at least) than we know about! The brainalone receives 400 billion pieces of information every second, but we are awareof just 2,000. What’s more, experiments have revealed that electrical signalsnecessary to move a limb, open your mouth or take any ‘physical’ action, beginsome half a second before sensory signals arrive in the brain to be translatedinto action. Who or what is tapping the keyboard here?It is said that we use only a fraction of our brain’s capacity, less than tenper cent in most cases. I say that this ‘unused’ capacity is operating atfrequencies that science has not yet measured and connects us with realms waybeyond electromagnetic light (or that’s what it is meant to do). This is theconnection the manipulators work to suppress. I suggest that fundamental to thisis the corpus callosum which links both hemispheres of the brain and regulatesinformation passing between them. It also dictates which hemisphere will governperception and behaviour at any point. The left side (which dominates ‘modern’society) deals with the ‘logical’, analytical, judgemental and verbal; the rightis about the creative, artistic, intuitive, visual and emotional. Clearly, thecorpus callosum is key to the process of either intergrating this brain dualityinto a unified whole or keeping us ‘in two minds’. If information passing fromright to left is suppressed, the person will be ‘this world’ dominated and farless intuitive. It is worth noting that the ‘education’ system is almostentirely aimed at the left side of the brain with the right-brain stimulators,like music and art, way down the list of priorities and continuing to diminish.The most successful students are therefore left-brain prisoners, and they arethe people who go on to administer the system through politics, banking,business, medicine, science and media. It is no surprise that they perpetuatethe left-brain society the Illuminati has sought to impose. There are billionsof neurons in the corpus callosum that are a mystery to science and they have noidea what they do. It will eventually be realised that this ‘brain-bridge’ ispart of the transmitter/receiver system that connects us to ‘out there’ and toeach other – as with the hundredth monkey syndrome (Figure 47).The hypothalamus at the base of the brain is another vital regulator of the bodyand it works closely with the pituitary gland, the ‘master gland’ of theendocrine system, and the pineal gland, the so-called ‘Third Eye’, through whichwe manifest ‘psychic sight’. The endocrine glands connect the body to the chakrasystem and this network links our ‘physical’ reality with the wider universe ofunseen energy. What are called psycho-active drugs – like ayahuasca – open usconsciously to those areas of the brain and DNA that interact with these otherrealms.There’s another crucial point to highlight about DNA: it is also the home ofwhat we call the mind and emotions. This is the greatest deceit of all thatholds us in servitude to the Matrix because we accept that our instinctiveresponses and reactions must be coming from us; they must be who we are. As I’vesaid, everything is consciousness, but there are different levels of awareness.When I use the term ‘mind’, I mean thoughts emitting through and from DNA andnot consciousness in its ‘Oneness’ state. The mind is a software programconnected to the Matrix, as are emotions. We believe our thoughts and emotionsare our own, but they are the program playing out its pre-recorded responses andreactions. You’ll notice that when we feel emotions there is an immediatephysical affect. Our heartbeat quickens, the mouth dries or we feel sick in thestomach. Emotions cause bodily reactions because that is where they are located– in the DNA. Once again, the hypothalmus in the brain is a prime regulator ofour emotional state. One Internet explanation said:> ‘… The Hypothalamus organizes and controls many complex emotions, feelings and> moods, as well as all motivational states including hunger, appetite and food> intake, and everything to do with the concept of pleasure including> satisfaction, comfort and creative activities. The neurons in the Hypothalamus> produce a number of Hypothalamic neurotransmitters which relay information and> instruction to all parts of the body … The Hypothalamus … is intimately> involved in the integration of all physiological stimulation, all 5 senses …> which it then translates, distils and assembles into one discernible> “package,” relating all the attributes of an experience …’ image [../Images/00052.jpg]Figure 47: The hypothalamus in the brain is a key regulator of our emotionalstate and it organises and controls feelings and moods, as well as hunger,appetite and food intake, and everything to do with the concept of pleasure andcreative activity. The Hypothalamus is vital to the balance of body, mind andemotions and, as we shall see later, it is targeted by chemicals used inmass-market food and drinkThe hypothalamus is an excellent example of how the physical, mental andemotional (‘all attributes of an experience’) are processed through the samesource – the DNA/brain. I should define what I mean by the term Emotion in thisbook because I know some writers believe that emotions are either our connectionto the ‘One’, or that the One is their origin. I have heard it said that weconnect to Oneness through the emotions of joy and happiness, but I don’tperceive these as emotions. I say that true joy and bliss are natural states ofOneness – as I experienced in Brazil – and they don’t need a name to describethem called ‘emotions’. They just are. Oneness is bliss and joy … love. When weopen to Oneness beyond the program we experience these states because they arethe nature of the One. These are not emotions; they are a state of Oneness.Emotions under my definition are programmed reactions that disconnect us fromawareness of the One and we don’t know what real joy, bliss and happiness reallyis within the Matrix flytrap, unless we connect with the One. We judge our stateof ‘happiness’ by our level of unhappiness. ‘Oh I feel a lot less unhappy today,so I must be happy.’ That kind of happiness is emotion, but not the Onenessvariety that defies any label. I suggest that what we understand as emotion(including illusory ‘happiness’) is a software program designed to enslave usand I will develop this theme later.Emotions are phenomena of the DNA hologram. If you rub your hands over your bodyand press with your fingers, you will usually find areas that are uncomfortablewhen there is no ‘rational’ reason why. Alternative healers, involved in whatthey call ‘body work’ or kinesiology, locate these areas very skilfully and mygoodness they can hurt. These points of discomfort are unprocessed emotionsstored in the body (often as toxins) and when the locations are massaged thefreed emotions are often expressed through anger, tears and so on. This storedemotion is actually information held in the hologram and is akin to a hard driveon a computer holding saved data. It’s like a computer operator saving somethinghe doesn’t want to deal with immediately. The body-work healers are, in effect,pressing the delete button.People say things like ‘I am only human’, and they talk of ‘human nature’, as ifthis is who they are. But it’s not. They are the consciousness of InfinitePossibility and what we call ‘human’ is the DNA mind, emotions and holographic‘body’. What makes us ‘human’ is the Matrix interactive software program in theDNA, and we confuse this with who we are. It is also what makes us men, women,black, white, young or old. These are programs and this misunderstanding is atthe very core of the illusion. We are not our bodies, mind or emotions. We areInfinite Consciousness.An article in The Scotsman newspaper in 2004 featured the research of DavidHamilton, a scientist who changed his views on life after experiencing afirewalk. It was clear that if you could walk through fire without getting burntthere was just a little bit more to know about the nature of reality. Thearticle explained how Hamilton became convinced that our mental and emotionalstates can not only affect our health, but actually change the DNA. Yes, theycan, and the reason is that they are the DNA. When one part of a computerchanges, it affects the whole computer because the data passing through thesystem is changed. So it is with our changing mental and emotional states thataffect the balance of the DNA and thus our ‘physical’ health. This is how theplacebo effect works when people regain health after taking sugar pills theybelieve are powerful drugs. The belief in the ‘drug’ rewrites the DNA (and/ortells the RNA to read the program to match the belief) and manifests the ‘cure’they believed the treatment would bring. David Hamilton said he had found some500 scientific papers from mainstream academic journals which confirmed theeffect that thought, feeling and faith (belief) have on the body’s systems, andhe highlighted in particular the work of Eric Kandel, joint winner of the NobelPrize for Medicine in 2000. Kandel has concluded that many genetic differencesbetween people are influenced by society and conditioning and are not justinherited from parents. These influences caused genes to switch on or off andthis is the DNA computer system reacting to changing input. Hamilton cited ascientific study of rat pups which showed that two separate growth hormones areswitched off in those deprived of a mother’s touch. He went on:> ‘There is a whole branch of medicine called psychoneuroimmunology, which> studies the effect of thoughts and emotions on our biochemistry. The> biochemistry is intimately connected with the DNA, so if these … components> are affected by thoughts and emotions then thoughts and emotions must also> affect our DNA.’ image [../Images/00053.jpg]image [../Images/00054.jpg]Figures 48 and 49: The stunning effect of thought and words on water crystals.The crystal in Figure 48 formed after water was exposed to words of ‘love andappreciation’; in Figure 49, the words were ‘You make me sick – I will killyou’. The difference makes clear the power of words, thoughts and emotions toaffect the world, not least the human body, which, in this reality, is mostlywater.(For more examples see the books, Messages from Water, volumes one and two, byMasaru Emoto)Yes, because they are DNA! The brilliant work of Japanese scientist, MasaruEmoto, at the I.H.M.-Institute in Tokyo, has revealed how water is fundamentallyaffected by words, thoughts and emotions – all of which are waveforms. He andhis team exposed water to various music and different words and expressions, andthen froze it to produce water crystals. When these were examined under amicroscope the response of the water was amazing. In Figures 48 and 49 you cansee the way the crystals responded to the words and thoughts (vibrations) of‘Love and appreciation’, and, ‘You make me sick – I will kill you’. Imagine theeffect on the body hologram of our words and deeds when it is some 70 per centwater (this figure varies by age and weight); and these attitudes, and states ofbeing, rewrite the DNA in the same way that they affect water crystals. (I haveto laugh when I hear people say that planets have no effect on us – within theillusion – when our bodies are 70 per cent water and the moon alone can move thetides across entire oceans!) Incidentally, it is not the words that have theeffect, but the intent behind them. If you said ‘I will kill you’ in alight-hearted, jokey fashion, it would not have the same effect as it would ifyou meant it, or said it with malevolence. Thought and emotions produce waveforms and quite obviously music does. Music can be healing and inspiring orextremely detrimental, depending on its vibrational impact.I also saw a documentary that showed how the brain forms networks of electricalconnections in response to mental and emotional states. The longer these statescontinue, like depression, and worry, the more this network ‘solidifies’ andbecomes the reflex-response system of the brain. It is literally likeprogramming a computer and the brain edits reality in line with the program thatthe mental and emotional state has downloaded. But the moment we change ourthoughts and emotions, say to enthusiasm and optimism, these electricalconnections break up and re-form to reflect the new attitude. Thoughts andemotions can be measured as chemical reactions because the pituitary gland inthe brain, interacting with the hypothalamus, releases chemicals known aspeptides in response to emotional changes, and these chemicals attach toreceptors on the cells. Whether it is a chemical form of what we call ‘love’ (inits human sense), or ‘hate’, or even a drug like heroin, they all connect withthe cells through the same receptors.I have written in other books about what I call emotional addiction when peoplerequire a constant fix of an emotion, be it anger, depression or ‘love’. Onemain reason for this is the addiction to the chemicals secreted by thehypothalamus/DNA network when emotions are felt. In the words of the RobertPalmer song, for example, people can be ‘addicted to love’. As with alladdictions, there can be a need to constantly increase the dose to get the sameeffect and humans are subconsciously creating situations in their lives to givethem the emotional fix. Such people will create circumstances in which they canget angry, worry or become depressed, while others will jump from partner topartner saying, ‘I fall in love so easily’. They are addicted to the melodramabecause they are addicted to the chemical fix it supplies. Dr Candice Pert,author of Molecules of Emotion: The Science Behind Mind-Body Medicine (ScribnerBook Company, 1999), said: ‘At any instant our body is in our mind and our mindis in our body’. This is because mind and body – and emotions – are expressionsof the same DNA. What we call ‘personality’ (mind and emotions) is a DNA programand we have been kidded to believe that this is who we are. When we ride a horsewe don’t believe that we are the horse, do we? But with the body, and its mindand emotions, we do.I have heard it said by psychologists that there is only a small number of whatthey call archetypal ‘personalities’. Some say there are no more than 12 basicones. The Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung, sought to connect these archetypes togenetic inheritance and believed them to be instinctive. He said we are bornwith these patterns that structure our imagination and make it distinctly human,and he suggested that archetypes are very closely linked to our bodies. Jungidentified the archetypal patterns in every culture and period of human history,and found that they mirrored the same archetypal ‘laws’ in all cases. Hesuggested that a ‘Universal Unconscious’ was behind all this. Humans did nothave separate, or personal, unconscious minds and instead shared a singleUniversal Unconscious, Jung said. What we call the conscious mind was rooted inthis, he believed, and to him the mind was shaped according to universalpatterns. I’d say he was right in all these assumptions, but that the archetypalpatterns come from the Matrix via the DNA/brain. The Matrix, at this level ofreality, is Jung’s Universal Unconscious – the energy/matter that we can’t see,which is constantly interacting with the 95 per cent of brain activity notrelated to the waking state and to the 95 per cent or so of ‘junk DNA’.* This iswhy, as he said, personality patterns are inherited and closely linked with thebody. Too right they are – through the DNA. These are the patterns that, in histerms, make us ‘distinctly human’. They are the human software program. Likeeverything in this reality, ‘humans’ are a computer construct and not who wereally are. Psychiatrists and mainstream therapists who work with the ‘humanmind’ are like computer tech-support and hypnotists are reprogrammers. They arenot dealing with consciousness within the definition in this book, but the mind– a software program.Oneness is All Possibility and yet humans overwhelmingly fall into a few basicarchetypal personalities. How can this be? We see such a contradiction becausethe archetypes are not Oneness in awareness of itself; they are softwareprograms downloaded and read by the DNA/RNA. Look at the classic ‘fight orflight’ response, which comes from the reptilian brain. When people or animalsare faced with danger they either fight or run for it. Are they really the onlychoices in such a situation within Infinite Possibility? No, of course they’renot. They are programmed reactions. Our emotional responses are almost entirelypredictable for the same reason. I have known people in highly volatilerelationships who were simply reacting to each other according to DNA program.They pressed each other’s buttons and reacted in the same way every time. It islike tapping data into the other’s computer and pressing enter. The Matrix wantsus to react in this way because it leads to conflict and instinctive(programmed) behaviour that produces the energy that empowers the system. Whensome of these volatile couples saw what was happening and stopped reactingaccording to program, bingo, the storm was over. Their consciousness began tohave the relationship instead of their DNA programs that react through what wecall instinct.As I have mentioned, electrical activity necessary for any ‘physical’ actionbegins some half a second before the conscious mind makes the ‘decision’ to act.Benjamin Libet and Bertram Feinstein, neurophysiologists at Mount Zion Hospitalin San Francisco, asked people to press a button when they were touched. Theoutcome was that the brain reacted to the touch in 0.0001 of a second and thebutton was pressed in 0.1 of a second. But the person was not aware of feelingthe touch or pressing the button for a full half-a-second. The subconsciousprogramming makes the decisions and the conscious level is the observer andreactor – unless consciousness intervenes. Without that, the conscious andsubconscious minds – both expressed through the DNA – will react according toprogram or what some call ‘archetype’.Once you stop the programming governing your mental and emotional responses, ahigher awareness – Infinite Possibility – can come in and override thearchetypes. More than that, it can rewrite the DNA/RNA program and attune it toOneness, instead of the Matrix. These programmed archetypal reactions aremercilessly exploited by the Illuminati. They know that if they input something,like 9/11, they are going to get a predictable DNA/RNA reaction, which they canmanipulate to advance their agenda. I saw an old First World War recruitingposter that called for the men of the Isle of Wight to attend a meeting aimed atpersuading them to volunteer to fight for their country. It said that ‘Patrioticairs would be sung’ and, of course, this was meant to manipulate the menemotionally to react to ‘love of country’ by signing up to die. Emotions are themajor access code to the body computer, including the mind. Now we havemulti-channel television, Hollywood movies and the media in general, to whip upthe emotional response to events that leads people to ‘fight for their country’and support governments that send them to kill and be killed.Unless we operate from a level of awareness beyond emotional reaction, theMatrix will continue to construct our reality. Problem-Reaction-Solution depends100 per cent for its success on this response system, and the Fear of NotSurviving Program, located in the reptilian brain, is the central target. Are wegoing to let the Matrix dictate our lives through our DNA, or are we going toopen ourselves to awareness beyond the Illusion and manifest that level ofconsciousness? When we do the latter we are in this world, but not of it, and Iwill go into this further in the final chapter. I wrote earlier how the mystic,Sri Aurobindo Ghose, said that most humans possess a mental screen that keepsthem from seeing behind the veil of matter. That screen is the DNA/RNA and theway it interprets reality through the body’s central processing unit, the brain,within the tiny frequency range called visible electromagnetic light.Astrophysicist and esoteric researcher, Giuliana Conforto, wrote in her book,Organic Universe (Edizioni Noesis, Italy, 2004):> ‘We have to remember that the luminous matter we observe with our instruments> is only 0.5 per cent of all calculated mass. What we see with our eyes is> still less. “Reality” is a thin “film” of [electromagnetic] light, a visible> matrix, our biological body or robot can interact with; such a body is just a> “costume” that lets us participate in the “film” itself for a while; it is not> our true identity or “I”.’ So what is the Matrix? It is information, a ready-to-wear world and beliefsystem broadcast to the DNA as frequencies, and decoded into holographic 3Dcollective reality. It acts like a voice talking in our heads, telling us whatto believe is real. In the Matrix movies when they looked at computer screensfull of moving green codes, they were seeing street scenes and people. It is thesame with our illusory reality. Scientists and esoteric researchers haveidentified recurring mathematical codes like the Fibonacci number sequence foundthroughout nature. This involves adding the last two numbers to get the nextone, as in 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21… . The sequence can be found in everything from theproportions of the human body to the way plants grow. Other mathematical andgeometrical codes and recurring sequences include Phi proportions, Golden Mean,so-called ‘sacred geometry’, numerology, the Chinese I Ching, astrology and manyothers. These are the mathematics of the Matrix which, at least in this reality,can be broken down into numbers and codes, as with DNA.Appropriately, and not coincidentally, this is how computers work. Everythingyou see on a computer screen, including the colours, are sequences of numbersusing the binary system based on 1 and 0. This is an expression of the dualityand polarity of the Matrix, like negative and positive, yin and yang. Many ofthe Illuminati symbols I have identified in other books, such as the pentagram,are codes that relate to the mathematics of the Matrix and affect how DNAinterprets reality. These are placed all ‘around’ us to manipulate the way wedecode our reality into holographic experience. As I, and others, have longdetailed, towns and cities like Washington D.C. are laid out according to thegeometry of the Matrix. The vortex points all over the planet that form perfectgrid patterns are also part of this mathematical construct and the Matrix can bemanipulated at these locations. Stone circles like Stonehenge and Avebury, andthe temples of the Illuminati secret societies, have been built on thesevortices, and they are also targeted for satanic rituals. Everything can beexpressed as numbers within the Matrix. Stephen Marquardt, an American doctor,who has studied Fibonacci number sequences with regard to the human face,correctly concluded: ‘All life is biology. All biology is physiology. Allphysiology is chemistry. All chemistry is physics. All physics is math[s]’. Hemight have added that all maths is energy and all energy is consciousness.The DNA/RNA network, in the act of ‘observing’ wave patterns, transforms theminto holographic illusion and the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, was quiteright when he said that human beings were like people sitting in a cave alwaysfacing a wall. The universe was the shadows projected on the wall – illusionsthat the people mistake for reality. That is a perfect description of what I amoutlining here. Everything you think you see, including your own body, is ahologram, a 3D illusion, which is fed to you to trap your consciousness inmesmerised servitude. Think moth. Think light. That’s us and that’s the Matrix.Wow.> *I stress again that these figures are approximate> *Figures vary depending on the source and I have also seen the figure of 90%> quoted.

It forgives everything except genius> Oscar Wilde The Matrix sells us the illusion of passing from past to future when we areactually going nowhere. ‘Time’ is one of the most effective ways of enslavingus. Oneness is no-time and if we attune ourselves to the deceit of passingthrough time we disconnect from awareness of the Infinite. How can you connectwith someone standing still when you are hurtling past them in a sports car onyour way from labour ward to cemetery? Hey, look, there’s Oneness …Zeeeeowwwwwwwwww … shit, missed him – and her.When people hear claims that past and future are happening together they usuallydismiss the idea as ridiculous and impossible. After all, aren’t we passingthrough the ‘years’ and getting ‘older’ by the ‘day’? I understand the question,but days, years and ageing are all illusions that we manifest because we believein them – or our DNA does. Given that everyone else is ageing around us, whywould we not think it was real? But then everyone ages because they are allcaught in the same illusion. How can we age when there is no time? We can’t. Butwe can experience the illusion of ageing when that is written into the Matrixsoftware (again involving the hypothalamus and endocrine glands) and ourconsciousness falls for it. A hologram projected by a laser from an interferencepattern never ages and yet our bodies – also holograms – go through apredictable cycle of young to old, birth to death. The difference is that onehologram is programmed to age and the other is not. People talk about the powerof mind over matter, but to rewrite the ageing software we need to have thepower of consciousness over mind – higher awareness over DNA program. That’s theway to change all the programs.I have had some visions and insights about illusory ‘time’ while I have beensitting here writing, in fact they are hitting me like machine gun bullets. Takethe world we live in to be a movie you are watching on DVD. You press the buttonand the movie begins to take you from scene to scene. You are passing from A toB to C or, put another way, passing from past to future. But when you get, say,to the middle of the movie, the part you have just watched has not ceased to be.It is still there in the same form, it’s just that the laser is now reading adifferent part of the disk. If you press stop and run back you’ll find thatexactly the same scenes you have watched are still there. Ahead of you in themovie is the part you haven’t yet seen, the ‘future’. But fast forward andyou’ll find it is already there before you arrive in the course of scenefollowing scene at ‘normal’ speed. When you get to the end of the movieeverything you have seen and experienced is still there for other people toexperience or for you to watch again. The past, as you perceived it, is alwaysthere and so is the future. They are all happening at once, and past and futureare illusions relative to where you are in the movie, or the software program.A sense of ‘time’ is based merely on the observer’s perspective. This is why, asEinstein pointed out, when you are doing something you like ‘time flies’, andwhen you are in the dentist’s chair it appears to ‘pass’ slowly. When you panic,time seems to pass very quickly, but not so when you stay calm. The very factthat time is relative to the observer means there is no time. It is a perceptionand not ‘real’. Our manufactured official ‘time’ is linked to the earth’srotation and when that changes so does our ‘time’. In America, you can driveacross a state border and be in a different hour, and when you fly across theInternational Date Line you are instantly in a different day. Time is anillusion.The theme of that DVD analogy is how the Matrix Time Loop works, as Ihighlighted in Tales from the Time Loop at considerable length. What I call theTime Loop is the vibrational level of the Matrix that we think of as thephysical world, the realm of visible electromagnetic light, and it appears tomove from past to future. ‘Time’ is there to entrap us in the Matrix and detachus from consciously reconnecting with the Infinite that we are. What we callpast and future is our illusory journey ‘through’ a software program orholographic movie on DVD. The Time Loop movie is always there to be experiencedat whatever point you choose. Imagine a storyboard on a wall and you choose tostart at a certain place and walk along the wall following the story for a whilebefore walking away. Then you might come back and read some more at anotherstage of the story (‘reincarnation’). The basic backdrop – the world we see‘around’ us – remains constant unless one of the following intervenes to changeit:> •The Matrix brain or central computer system changes the messages it transmits> for us to decode into holographic reality.> •Consciousness overrides that program and sends its own instructions to the> DNA/RNA/brain network.> •Our DNA software is rewritten by experience or programming, as with the> Illuminati manipulation of information and the suppression of alternative> realities.It is not DNA or even the Matrix that is the problem; it is the nature of theprogram that they follow. There are actually multiple matrices or possible ‘pastand future’ realities to choose from – just as you can have many differentrecordings on a DVD – and I will develop this point later. One of the uniquecharacteristics of a holographic film is also that, unlike a conventionalpicture, you can have many images on the same print. They are differentinterference patterns, waveforms, and the various pictures are selected by theangle at which the laser strikes the film. This is the same principle as thelaser passing across the wave patterns of the DVD picking out the scenes inorder. What I am suggesting is that our DNA/RNA decodes wave patterns broadcastby the Matrix in basically the same way and, as the angle of ‘strike’ changes,we move from scene to scene as if we are moving ‘forward’. But. We are actuallygoing nowhere. Does your DVD machine go anywhere while it is playing theHollywood film that appears to ‘move’? Do the actors go anywhere or thebackdrops for their scenes? Do we go anywhere when we are ‘moving’ around theInternet? No, we are just sitting there. We are not moving in our daily lives,either.Moving is an illusion because it’s all going on in our brain. It’s like playingone of those virtual reality car-racing games when you appear to be speedingaround a track, but in fact you are just sitting in a chair. You are not moving;the game is. It’s the same with the Matrix super-hologram. I go into modessometimes, especially when I am driving, when I see the world moving in my mindwhile my body goes nowhere. The virtual-reality game is so clear to me in thesemoments. It’s like the story of the two monks debating about the movement of aflag in the wind. ‘The flag is moving’, said one. ‘No, the wind is moving’, saidthe other. A third, passing by and hearing the conversation, said: ‘The flag isnot moving. The wind is not moving. Your mind is moving’. Remember in the Matrixmovies how people were ‘plugged in’ to the Matrix through their brains while‘they’ stayed outside sitting in a chair without moving? It’s the sameprinciple.There is something highly significant about the angle at which we observereality in the Matrix computer game. I saw a hologram in a shop a few years agothat showed a human face when you looked at one angle and a reptile face whenthe angle was changed. What I saw, in effect, was a shape-shift. The Matrix isan enormous library of waveform images waiting for DNA/RNA to manifest them asholograms. I remember being contacted by the neighbour of a man who worked as agardener at one of the British Royal Family estates at Sandringham, in Norfolk.The man had been describing very bizarre experiences there. Through theneighbour, I arranged to meet him, but then he was apparently warned not tospeak with me. However, one of the experiences he had recounted to the neighbourwas about part of the estate where he had seen two completely different scenesat the same location. If you looked from one angle (his words), it was a smallwood and if you looked from another it was a Swedish-style pine cottage! It iswe, through our DNA/RNA, who change the scenery we experience by, to maintainthe movie analogy, selecting different ‘sets’ or locations in the program. It isnot the scenery that is changing, but rather our DNA/RNA that makes the sceneryappear to change as it decodes the wave patterns. Strike them at one point andyou are in the ‘future’, strike them at another and you are in the ‘past’, orthe ‘present’. But where is the past, present and future on a software programor movie? There is no past or future – everything is happening NOW. This is howpsychic people are able to ‘see’ what we call the future. Their DNA/RNA networkhas the ability to pick out the frequency patterns ‘later’ in the movie. It isthe same with those who have visions of the past.image [../Images/00055.jpg]Figure 50: ‘Past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ on DVD. All are happening at the same‘time’ in different parts of the same ‘disk’ and what happens in one ‘scene’ canaffect all the rest. Thus, the ‘past’ can change the ‘future’ and the ‘future’can change the ‘past’I have read and been told of many experiences where people have seen something,like a building, and yet when they return, even hours or sometimes minuteslater, it has disappeared. I remember one story about people who saw anold-style American house on fire as they drove past and they immediately went tocall for help. It was standing by itself back from the road and was clearlyvisible like any other building. But when they returned there was no house andno sign of where one had been. They had somehow accessed a different part of theprogram. As we change our DNA/RNA focus from one wave pattern to another, thepatterns we have ceased to manifest still exist for other DNA (people and allliving things) to experience.As I was writing this I had a clear picture of a DVD with scenes from ‘history’lined up along the surface as the laser moved across to manifest the variousevents in turn. And the laser was RNA reading the program. You can see NeilHague’s portrayal of the image in Figure 50. This symbolises how, as we strikeor observe different patterns in the program and ‘move’ into the ‘future’, thereis other consciousness ‘following’ us in the program and still more ‘ahead’ ofus. As we change scenes, so others are accessing the scenes we left behind.Using that earlier analogy of walking past a storyboard on a wall, someone elsecan walk behind you reading (experiencing) the same scenes that you have becausethe basic story is always there until it is changed. What I am saying,therefore, is the ‘past’ has not ceased to be, and nor is the future yet to be.Both are being played out Now by those in other parts of the program. We seeStonehenge, for example, as an ancient ruin from the past because that is wherewe are in the Matrix/Time Loop program/movie. But, at another point, people are‘living’ at the original Stonehenge, and at another it is not even built yet! Inone part of the program the American War of Independence may be just startingand at another the Second World War is still going on.I know it sounds impossible that the same battle is constantly being fought, butthink about it. When you have a battle in a movie on DVD or the Internet, thestart, middle, and end of the fighting always exists on the disk or software. Itis the same with the Matrix. When you spin back a movie and press ‘play’, hasanything changed since you last watched it? No, and, once again, it is the samewith the Matrix unless the script is rewritten by either the Matrix orconsciousness making decisions at odds with the software. The latter is whythose Matrix clones, the Illuminati, are so freaked out by mavericks that refuseto conform to the program. In doing so, they are rewriting it. Consciousness cando this by overriding the program through the DNA. If we don’t, then, as theysay, history keeps repeating. The Stone Age, Iron Age, Industrial Revolution andcomputer-dominated world of ‘today’ are happening over and over. To experiencethem you need to be at that point in the program, that’s all. We are not goinganywhere, not evolving, we are experiencing part of a program designed toenslave us and turn us into generators of fear – the energy that powers theMatrix.Think of horses on a carousel. Whether anyone is sitting on them or not theystill go round with the rest. Our ‘physical’ bodies are biological computersreading software programs and they are running all the time. The question iswhether self-aware consciousness chooses to experience this illusory worldthrough one of those software carousel ‘horses’ (human bodies) or not. If itdoesn’t, the ‘body’ will still play out the program, because it is a biologicalcomputer capable of ‘thought’ (assessment of data). But it will be nothing morethan software without consciousness as defined in this book. Everything you seein the Matrix is part of the program, including your own body. The exception tothis is your consciousness, those that have any that is, because, in the way Iam defining consciousness in this book, not everyone has. The phenomenon of the‘woman in the red dress’ in the first Matrix movie, the woman who was just partof a software program despite appearing ‘real’, is not confined to a Hollywoodsci-fi script. These ‘computer’ creations, these carousel horses with no rider,are everywhere. There are three main groups of ‘people’ in the Matrix (seeFigure 51):> 1)First there are the software programs whose only consciousness is the> DNA/RNA receiving instructions from the Matrix. They are constructs of mind,> not consciousness. All energy/consciousness is Infinite Oneness, but not all> expressions of this are at the same level of awareness.

A lot of that is going on, too.image [../Images/00056.jpg]Figure 51: The three types of ‘human’: on the left is the pure software program,the horse with no rider, which includes the ‘pure’ Illuminati bloodlines; thecentre image represents the majority of ‘humans’ who are self-awareconsciousness, but trapped in the illusion and dominated by the program; and onthe right is symbolised the much smaller – but rapidly growing – number ofpeople who are connected in awareness to consciousness beyond the Matrix. Forthis reason they perceive life and the world very differently to the rest andcan be seen as ‘crazy’ or ‘dangerous’> 2)Other people do have consciousness, but are so entranced and deluded by the> Matrix that their DNA programming calls the shots and dictates the path that> they take.

The Matrix targets these> people with a vengeance to protect its control and also because if it can> manipulate this level of consciousness to become caught in the illusions and> succumb to fear, it is a massive potential energy source.Consciousness has become trapped by the Matrix in a maze of smoke and mirrorsthat has implanted a false reality. The ‘Red Dresses’, or software people, areno problem because they just follow the codes. The targets of the Matrix arethose with self-aware consciousness who find themselves, for whatever reason,caught in the flytrap. It is in pursuit of these people – this consciousness –that the system of society is so designed in this part of the program. I havebeen saying in my books for years that the system has been structured to holdconsciousness in a prison of the five senses. You can see everywhere that thisis so obviously true. But what is this five-sense jail cell? It is a prison ofthe brain and body – the DNA! While we are focused purely on the five-sensereality we are slaves to the DNA that dictates our thoughts, emotions andactions. The consciousness of most people never gets its hands on the wheel oflife because the DNA will not vacate the driver’s seat. Consciousness in itsreconnected infinite power could easily take control, but it is difficult to dothis when you are not aware that you are Infinite Consciousness and you thinkthat the DNA thoughts and emotions you are having are yours. This is how themovie constantly plays out while slumbering consciousness thinks it is callingthe shots!The aim is to turn conscious beings into generators of fear in all its forms toempower the Matrix, and to take away freedom and replace it with what I callfeardom – domination by fear. One of the major ways this is done is through thesoftware programs that we call ‘leaders’. You will recall the emphasis I haveplaced on the obsession of the Illuminati families with interbreeding andgenetics. As I have already suggested, what we call procreation is the recordingof two software programs (father and mother) onto one disk – the child. Allbodies are software programs and the difference is whether they are puresoftware (Red Dresses) or whether consciousness is involved. When consciousnessexpresses itself through the body it rewrites the DNA programming which, inturn, is transmitted to other DNA and to the Matrix in general. These peoplechange what we call the bloodline and, as a result, these Red Dress geneticlines become increasingly less controlled by the dictates of the program. Suchpeople will have a heart dimension to their views and decisions; they will havea sense of empathy, compassion and fairness. They will not, in short, react as aprogrammed disk in the way the Matrix demands with violence, bigotry and anabsence of empathy with those who suffer the consequences of their actions. Theworld is awash with this mentality because it is awash with software people.The leading Red Dress bloodlines are the Illuminati families. At the level weare discussing now, the reason they are so obsessed with interbreeding andavoiding outside genetic input is to ensure that their replicated programs(‘offspring’) remain pure software and are not rewritten by the infusion ofconsciousness. Since the ancient world (as we perceive it anyway), they havebred (copied the disks) overwhelmingly with each other. The royal families thatruled ancient societies were mostly Red Dress software programs and theymaintain this power today through Illuminati families like the Rothschilds,Rockefellers, Windsors and those I name in my other books (Figure 52). The Bushfamily is the same, but then you only have to see George ‘Dubya’ to know that.Obviously he was a duff download. The Illuminati Red Dresses are there todictate and control conscious beings so they remain caught in the illusion andproduce the desired fear to fuel the system. By placing themselves at the top ofthe political, banking, business, media and military system these bloodlines caneasily do that, so long as most conscious people remain puppets to their DNA.The Matrix has its software in positions of power across the world and usesthese programs to cause the wars that conscious people, or lower level RedDresses, are told to fight. The wars generate enormous amounts of fear and theMatrix sucks it in. Interestingly, the Matrix movies featured a character, asoftware program, called the Merovingian. One of the purest Illuminatibloodlines (programs) is known by the same name because of its connection to theMerovingian kings in what is now France, leading up to the period ofCharlemagne. The Merovingian character in the movies was French and controlledthe Train Man who policed the in-between realm that was remarkably similar inconcept to the interspaces.Talking of which, I have connected a reptilian ‘species’ very strongly to theIlluminati and I can now see more clearly how this fits in. I remember CredoMutwa, the Zulu Sanusi, telling me once that ‘to understand the Illuminati youmust study the reptile’. How right he was and even more so in the light of whatis emerging. I did indeed study the reptile and it is as near to a computerprogram that you could find. Of course there are variations but, basically, theyare creatures controlled by instinct (programming) and they will react in anincredibly predictable way to any situation. I have watched a few demonstrationsat crocodile farms in Australia where the keeper told the audience how the crocwould react to something he was going to do and every time, without exception,that is what happened. The Illuminati, too, are nothing if not predictable intheir techniques and reactions, and the character traits of the reptilian brainwithin the human brain mirror those of the reptilians and Illuminati –cold-blooded attitudes with no empathy for their victims, a desire for top-downstructures of control, territorialism (this is mine keep out) and obsessiveritualistic behaviour. This describes the Illuminati exactly because they arereptilian software. You will find no better example of reptilian behaviour thanthe British Royal Family, which is obsessed with ritual and protocol.The Illuminati ‘human’ bodies are only holographic veils that hide their truenature. They allow them to operate undetected within the realm of visibleelectromagnetic light. The voice in Brazil described the Reptilians behind theIlluminati as very much like the agents, or ‘sentient programs’, that manipulatein the Matrix movies. They could either operate as a reptilian hologram, or hidebehind an apparently ‘human’ one, just as the sentient programs morph in and outof different human forms in the Matrix trilogy. Either way, the Reptilians andother projected agents of the Matrix were not ‘real’ in consciousness terms.They were like projections, holographic thought fields or, as the voice put it,highly sophisticated software programs. ‘If you programmed a computer to killchildren, would that computer have any emotional problems with that?’ the voiceasked. The answer is obvious; it would follow the program because it does nothave a consciousness to intervene in the decision. It was the same with theIlluminati Reptilians, the voice said. They were like digital people implantedin the movies alongside human actors. They appeared to be the same, but theywere not and their power of thought was limited to data processing within theconfines of their software.image [../Images/00057.jpg]Figure 52: The ‘Red Dress’ bloodlines of the Illuminati that dominate royalty,politics, banking, business and media. They obsessively interbreed to stop thesoftware program being rewritten by the infusion of self-aware consciousnessThe Reptilian program would seem to be a foundation code of the Matrix and it isnot surprising that even the magnified DNA has that look about it. The very factthat the body is a hologram with a reptilian brain means that throughout thesuper-hologram, or Matrix, the reptilian dimension must be repeated becauseevery part of a hologram contains a smaller version of the whole. The Reptiliansimmediately behind the Illuminati are one example of that. When you look at theresponse characteristics of the reptilian brain in ‘humans’, it is aboutinstinctive (programmed) emotional reactions and not consciousness or love. Thevoice in Brazil said the Illuminati Reptilians did not know they were tools ofthe Matrix – computer programs designed to manipulate the sub-plots in the moviethat generate the fear that powers the system, although they did have anunderstanding of how the Matrix works. The Reptilians feed off fear, but onbehalf of the Matrix that wrote their program. They think they are masters whenin truth they are slaves to their creator.I also stress that that there are Reptilians not involved in the manipulationand, even with regard to those who are, I am not presenting this informationfrom the perspective of ‘us’ and ‘them’. Everything is the same Oneness, whetherit is the energy/mind of a software program or Oneness in awareness of itself.The Matrix is controlled by our own fear and the Reptilians, Illuminati andother ‘enemies’, are this fear made manifest. They are us and we are them. Whenwe free ourselves from fear, they will cease to take illusory form because thesource of their projection will have been switched off.The holographic nature of reality explains how the Illuminati Reptilians, andothers, can shape-shift. I understand how people find it impossible tocomprehend how something can instantly swap its body, including heart, lungs,brain and so on, for another. But this is not what is happening because that’sall holographic illusion. If people think physical with this they will never getit. Shape-shifting is the movement from one illusory holographic projection(‘human’) to another (‘reptilian’). It is all happening as an illusion in thebrain because that’s where this whole reality is located. Scientists say this‘physical’ world is made up of atoms and subatomic particles such as electrons,and this is how author and researcher Michael Talbot describes their propertiesin the Holographic Universe:> ‘The electron, like some shape-shifter out of folklore, can manifest as either> a particle or a wave … This chameleon-like ability is common to all subatomic> particles. It is also common to all things once thought to manifest> exclusively as waves. Light, gamma rays, radio waves, X-rays – all can change> from waves and back again. Today physicists believe that subatomic phenomena> should not be classified solely as either waves or particles, but as a single> category of somethings that are always somehow both. These somethings are> called quanta, and physicists believe they are the basic stuff from which the> entire universe is made.’ Talbot adds that the ‘capacity to shape-shift from one kind of particle toanother is just another of a quantum’s abilities’, and he says of‘extraterrestrial’ entities: ‘ … if we are being visited by beings who are asinsubstantial and plastic in form … it is not at all surprising that they mightappear in a chameleon-like multitude of shapes’. We are dealing with avirtual-reality game here and so anything is possible. Shape-shifting is smalldeal once you realise what is happening, but people find it hard to comprehendbecause they believe the world to have solidity.I would stress, by the way, that the Reptilians and other Red Dress people arenot confined to the major Illuminati families. You find them throughout societyat all levels and especially at the extremes and polarities because the Matrixneeds polarities to function (Figure 53, overleaf). It is the realm of vibrationand for something to vibrate (as all does within the Matrix) it has to have twopoints or polarities between which to oscillate. Everywhere you see the systemseeking polarisation. The Red Dresses are programmed to create this and drawslumbering conscious beings into the manufactured conflicts and divisions.Listen to the mainstream software talk-show hosts on American radio or look atmany of the software soldiers and John Wayne sound-a-likes during the invasionof Iraq. I heard one soldier say on BBC television: ‘We bomb ‘em, you know? It’scool to me because I like explosions and stuff like that but, like, I don’t getto see the actual explosion, and that’s what I want to see but, I guess when weget closer to Baghdad we’ll get to see more of that.’ Definitely earlyMicrosoft, maybe Windows 95, or perhaps that’s optimistic. The uniform doesn’tmatter and nor does the race or the ‘cause’ they claim to be fighting for.Whether it is American troops killing civilians in Iraq, Israeli troopsmurdering Palestinians in Gaza or fanatics bombing restaurants or buses inJerusalem, they are versions of the same software program. Not all soldiers arelike that, some are consciousness caught in the game, but most are clone-likeprograms and you will find the same throughout the system.From this perspective we are able to see a deeper reason behind the Illuminatiobsession with mind control. I have written about this in detail in other booksbecause it is such a fundamental part of the Illuminati modus operandi. They usemillions of children abducted into the mind-control projects or handed over bytheir sick or mind-controlled parents. The children have their brains rewiredand their minds turned into a honeycomb of self-contained compartments known asAlters. What they call the ‘front alter’ is the one that interacts with theworld most of the time, and people who know them think this is them. Thesealters are implanted with specific tasks, together with trigger words and othercodes to activate the programming – everything from an assassination or beingsexually abused as a child, or adult, by a famous Illuminati name that theydon’t remember once the experiencing alter, or compartment, is switched toanother. What the Red Dress families behind these projects are doing is seekingto take conscious beings and reduce them to that of software. They wantconscious people for this because they have more potential abilities and giftsto be exploited than the most advanced of the software variety. For example, themajor Illuminati human sacrifice rituals are often conducted by a consciousbeing in a mind-controlled state. The top mind-controllers also know that thehuman body/brain is a holographic computer system and they exploit thisunderstanding to download programs onto their victims’ DNA and manipulate theRNA to read them. What we call the trigger words, sounds or images that activatethe programming are like pressing ‘enter’. Victims of Illuminati mind controlhave described how they could be drugged or drunk in one compartment, butimmediately clean and sober when they were switched to another. This isperfectly explainable when you realise that they were being switched betweensoftware.image [../Images/00058.jpg]Figure 53: Pure software programs are not confined to the Illuminati families.You find them at all levels of society and they are often the clone-like gofersthat serve the system without question. Self-aware consciousness can also behavethe same way when it is deeply caught in the illusionWhen I say it’s all an illusion and a computer program, I do mean all. It is anapparent contradiction that the earth and the cosmos was supposed to have beencreated by a loving God and yet what we call Nature is a bloody battle-ground inwhich one animal’s survival is dependent on another’s, often grotesque, demise.The voice in Brazil told me that there was no contradiction in this because the‘law of the wild’ was not the creation of a loving God or Oneness in awarenessof itself. It was a Matrix software program and, without the control of fear,the relationship between animals, and animals and humans, would be verydifferent. Did you ever sing that song at school called All Things Bright andBeautiful? It tells us how wonderful God is for making the world:> All things bright and beautiful,> All creatures great and small,> All things wise and wonderful,> The Lord God made them all.> Each little flower that opens,> Each little bird that sings,> He made their glowing petals,> He made their tiny wings.Well, it sounds like a good CV, but let’s read the small print here. There isanother way of looking at this:> All things shite and horrible,> All killers great and small,> All things pulled apart alive,> The Lord God made them all.> Each great big shark that eats you,> Each little snake that stings,> He made the lethal venom,> He made the torn off wings.The voice in Brazil asked: ‘Do you think the Infinite, where you are now, wouldwish to see anything suffer and live in fear, never mind create a structure inwhich this happened as a matter of course?’ Nature was another holographicprojection that was only ‘real’ because we were conditioned to believe it was(Figure 54, overleaf). The voice said the ‘laws’ of the natural world reflectedthe state of being of their creator, the force controlling the Matrix. This wasa state of fear and desperation to survive … a trait of the reptilian brain.(Observe human society and you’ll see how it is structured in the same way withpeople surviving or prospering at the expense of others – ‘dog eat dog’ and allthat.) There were, the voice said, some apparently beautiful expressions ofnature on ‘Planet Earth’ and so long as we realised they were illusions theycould be enjoyed. But we should be careful not to become mesmerised by what wesee on earth or we would become like a moth hypnotised by a light, trapped byillusions that held us in a disconnected state. The Matrix can be extremelycaptivating – just look at a clear night sky, or a panoramic landscape. Themessage was to enjoy what you see, but remember that what you ‘see’ is merelywhat you think you see or are manipulated to see (Figure 55 and 56).image [../Images/00059.jpg]Figure 54: Animals, the Natural World and the ‘law of the wild’ are allholographic illusions projected through DNA softwareimage [../Images/00060.jpg]image [../Images/00061.jpg]Figures 55 and 56: Everything in our ‘physical’ reality is a hologram decodedfrom waveforms by our brain/DNA/RNA. The ‘solid’ cats and rose here areholograms.(Pictures ‘Cats’ and ‘Rose2’ courtesy of Holography Studio, All-RussianExhibition Center, Moscow. For more see www.holography.ru[http://www.holography.ru])If you observe Nature from this perspective you can see the program veryclearly. A few months before I started this book I was watching a series on BBCtelevision called Massive Nature. It featured animals and fish that onlysurvived by reproducing in fantastic numbers because of all the predators theyfaced. If they didn’t do this their species would die out and so would otherswho depended on eating them for their own survival. This is a classic Matrixprogram with one creature surviving, or prospering, at the expense of another(again, see the ‘human’ world). Each show in the Massive Nature series followedthe same basic story in that the ‘massive’ species would make a journey everyyear that would take them through the very location where their predators lay inwait.One involved the Wildebeest, which is dinner for so many species in Africa,including the crocodiles featured in the BBC show. Every year the wildebeestwent on a journey for their own survival in search of the grass they needed andit took them across a river where the crocodiles would wait, knowing they werecoming. Some call this ‘instinct’ and I say that what we term ‘instinct’ is thesoftware program activated through their DNA. When the wildebeest tried to crossthe river there was carnage as the crocodiles attacked, and similar scenes arebeing constantly reproduced by other species of animals, birds and insectsacross the planet. Ain’t Nature great? The program is written to include thecircumstances in which the ‘massive’ species is spawned every year and then hasto travel from a safe area to where the predators are waiting to take advantage.The laws of nature, and how animals have incredible abilities or colourings tomeet their particular needs or environment, are computer programs, and this iswhat we call evolution. Sorry, Mr Darwin, evolution is the cycle of the programand survival or extinction depends on the keyboard operator, be it thefear-controlled Matrix or consciousness.Another documentary I saw told the story of Grey Whales which, once again, spentpart of the year in warm waters where they were safe, but had little food, andthen headed north where there was food, but they weren’t safe. Or at least thecalves weren’t. The programme showed how Killer Whales pursued a Grey Whale calffor six hours as its mother, who was too big and powerful to be attacked, triedto provide protection. The killers sought to separate calf from mother and holdit under the water to drown. The mother fought desperately to save her offspringand help it to breathe but, in the end, exhaustion took over and the KillerWhales lived up to their name. Even after all those hours of pursuit and allthat fear and trauma, they only ate the calf’s tongue and lower jaw and the restwas left to the scavengers on the ocean floor. It was just another bloodycrime-scene in the wonderful world of Nature. What kind of ‘intelligence’creates a natural world in which the survival of one depends on tearing anotherto pieces? What sick mind would design a global life-cycle in which theparticipants were in a mode of constant fear – humans as well as the animals?Would a loving God do that? No, but the mind behind the Matrix would, and ithas.Funnily enough, a few weeks after I saw the wildebeest documentary I waswatching another about the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland, when the Illuminatifrontman William of Orange (Protestant) was fighting for the British throneagainst James II (Catholic) in 1690. It led to the Protestant–Catholic conflictsin Ireland right up to modern times (this point in the program, in other words).At one stage in the computer-generated reconstruction of the battle, William’sfodder troops began to pour across a shallow part of the River Boyne while armyof James pounded them with a hail of gunfire from the other side. What I waswatching was a mirror of the wildebeest trying to cross the river under attackfrom the crocodiles. How appropriate because both are part of the same computerprogram – the Matrix. What is the difference between a lion or croc devouring awildebeest, tearing its flesh from its body, and a child being blown to piecesby a British or American bomb during the invasion of Iraq? They are products ofthe same mentality behind the program.All bodies are DNA software and it is the same with animals. Some will have aform of consciousness and others will not. Most animal species operate on a muchmore collective level of reality – more of a hive mind – and the Illuminati areseeking, through the reptilian brain, to take humanity further down this sameroad. As we can see, they have succeeded on an enormous scale. The moreconsciousness inhabits the software of the animal species the more it rewritesthe DNA. Also, the more the animal software comes into contact with humanself-aware consciousness, the more the same will happen because of thevibrational communication between them. A domesticated animal will have itsinstincts (DNA programming) rewritten by contact with self-aware consciousness,and the communication that takes place between the animal and human DNA via thecodes common to both. A domesticated dog and a wild dog may look basically thesame, but their behaviour traits and attitudes can be very different becausedomestication has changed the DNA program. Whales and dolphins would also appearto be examples of species that express consciousness at a far higher level thanmost others. Trees, flowers, plants and landscapes are software, too. I knowthis is highly controversial, but so what? No one has to believe it. I havealways loved the Natural World – animals, forests, seascapes and rollingcountryside. I still enjoy these scenes, even from my emerging perspective, butI see them in a different light. Instead of looking at something that is ‘real’,I see them as like beautiful holographic paintings that can be enjoyed, but notallowed to delude my reality of what they are.It’s all an illusion, even breathing and eating. We only have to do this becauseour DNA tells us that we do and we believe it. Remember that scene in the firstMatrix movie when the Neo and Morpheus characters are fighting in a kung fusoftware program? Morpheus says to a heavy-breathing Neo: ‘Do you think that’sair you’re breathing now, in this place?’ Of course it couldn’t have beenbecause his mind was in the kung fu program, not his body. But he still breathedbecause his mind was programmed to do so. Does pure energy, pure consciousness,have to breathe with lungs? So why do we when we are pure consciousness, too?Only because we believe we do and let us not forget that the world in which we‘need to breathe’ is all happening in our brain. There is no ‘out there’ wherethe laws of breathing apply. It is the same with eating. Does energy,consciousness, sit down to lunch or order a pizza? No, the DNA programming doesthat. The need for food, warmth and shelter is written into the Matrix programbecause it controls through dependency and the need to survive. If you didn’tneed food, warmth or shelter to survive look at how the control of the systemwould dissolve from your life. I am not saying we can just stop breathing andeating at the point when we intellectually see the nonsense of it. If we don’toverride the DNA programming our body will ‘die’ because its software says, ‘IfI don’t eat or breathe I will die’. It has to be done at the deepest of levelsso that this part of the program – I have to eat and breathe – is deleted. It isfor this reason that I am not about to hold my breath or cancel the dinnerreservation. But it is all illusion. Even what the food tastes like is aprogram. It is the Matrix that decides how an egg or banana tastes because whatwe call taste is just an electrical signal from the tongue to the brain (DNAcentral processing unit) which interprets the ‘taste’ in line with theprogramming. Different programs decode these signals in different ways – ‘I loveeggs’, ‘bananas are yuck’. As the voice in Brazil said:> ‘Do you think the Infinite sits down to dinner? Do you think the Infinite has> to breathe or it will die? So why do those in the Time Loop? Answer: because> they identify who they are and their sense of possibility with being a> physical “personality” subordinate to illusory “laws” and not with being what> they really are – the Infinite One.’ image [../Images/00062.jpg]Figure 57: The universe is a holographic illusion similar to looking up at the‘sky’ projected on the ceiling of a planetarium. When you look at the illusorynight sky in a planetarium it can look incredibly ‘real’. But what is it? Acomputer program! ‘Planet Saturn’ here is a hologram(Picture ‘Saturn’ courtesy of Royal Holographic Art Gallery. For more seewww.holograms.bc.ca [http://www.holograms.bc.ca])There have been people who have stopped eating without ill effects, as I explainin Tales from the Time Loop, because they are able to absorb nourishmentdirectly from light/energy without going through the ‘middle men’ of plants andanimals. The need to eat is, literally, all in the head, as is the ‘warmth’ ofthe sun on which life appears so dependent. ‘Do you think the Infinite needs thesun to survive?’ the voice asked. ‘You are the Infinite so why do you need thesun to sustain you?’ Certainly no sun was required in that state of bliss andwonder that I experienced in the ayahuasca session. The voice said that we feltheat from the sun simply because that is what the Matrix programmed the body tofeel. The sun and moon were holograms to provide the illusion of night and day –the movement of ‘time’. As Genesis puts it: ‘And God said, Let there be light:and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God dividedthe light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness hecalled Night’. Or, put another way: ‘And God said, Let there be light: and hetapped on the keyboard, pressed ‘enter’, and there was light’.I was told that what we call the Universe is a holographic illusion similar tolooking up at the ‘sky’ projected on the ceiling of a planetarium (Figure 57).The only difference was that in the ‘universe’ the projections appeared to be 3Dbecause they were holograms. When you look at the illusory night sky in aplanetarium it can look incredibly ‘real’. But what is it? A computer program!The ‘universe’ was a figment of our conditioned imagination, the voice said, andit was only part of our reality because we believed it was. The universe wasalso far smaller than people perceived even within our illusion of space anddistance. ‘Look at the sky in a planetarium and it seems so vast, yet it onlygoes as high as the ceiling.’ At one point in the Brazilian experience, thevoice said: ‘Do you think that’s the earth you’re lying on now? Mmmm …Illuuusion!’ As with everything in the Time Loop and throughout the Matrix, the‘physical’ earth was a holographic projection. ‘You are lying on the earth nowonly because you think you are’, the voice said. I believed I was lying on theearth because that is what my DNA program was telling me and the earth I was‘lying on’ only existed in my head! And even my head was another illusion.‘Remember always’, said the voice, ‘Infinite Love is the only truth, everythingelse is illusion – everything.’This includes ‘space’ as well as ‘time’. Scientists talk about the space/timecontinuum, but space and time do not exist. When a hologram is projected by alaser from the photographic interference pattern it appears to be 3D andoccupying ‘space’. But it isn’t, it just seems that way. Everything is InfiniteConsciousness, so everything is everything else. Therefore, a pinhead isinfinity because everything is infinity. Size is an illusion, as men have beensaying all along. Where does the droplet of water end and the ocean begin? Theydon’t; they are One. Infinity has no beginning and no end. The droplet(‘pinhead’) is the ocean.Scientists can’t understand why subatomic particles can communicate instantlywith each other over staggering distances because they are thinking in terms ofspace. But there is no space involved. It is like the droplet of water and theocean. There are no particles, plural, except in the way we perceive them in theillusion. All particles are the same One. They don’t have to communicate betweeneach other because there is no ‘each other’ and they don’t move from one placeto another because there is no space and so there can be no places.Appropriately the word ‘Utopia’ means ‘no place’ – beyond the illusion of timeand space. The super-hologram appears to occupy space and we talk of thevastness of space. But it’s a hologram and so that cannot be. If there is nospace how come we seem to travel through it? Once again because that is theillusion our DNA/RNA decodes for us and we travel through space only aselectrical signals interpreted by the brain. The voice in Brazil said: ‘Why doyou need to fly around in aircraft? You are point A and you are point B and youare everything in between. Why then do you need to use an aircraft to flythrough yourself?’ William Blake described this magnificently when he wrote:> To see a World in a Grain of Sand> And a Heaven in a Wild Flower> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand> And Eternity in an hour.This can also be related to the hologram because a grain of sand and a wildflower are smaller versions of the whole. In the same way, the inside of an atomis similar to a solar system, and the human body, itself made up of cells, islike a cell of the super-hologram.There is another important point to make about this Matrix software/illusionthing. What is ‘history’? OK, we might say that it is the earlier scenes in themovie leading up to where we are. Yes, it could be, but there are other ways tolook at it. We think we know what history is because of archaeological finds andaccounts ‘passed down’ through the ‘ages’ or other parts of the program, as Iwould put it. But have they been? I am not saying they have or haven’t, I’m justexploring other possibilities in the light of a greater understanding of theillusion we are experiencing as ‘life’. What if each part of the program has itsown version of history or that history is being changed at will by the Matrixsimply by changing the program it broadcasts to the DNA? A few taps on thekeyboard, a click of the mouse and, hey, we’ve just made an incredible discoverythat tells us more about our history! When the Matrix or consciousness changesthe program at any point, it could, and probably does, reassemble the entire DVDmovie/Time Loop in what we call the ‘past’ or ‘future’. You see the theme insome movies of people going back in ‘time’ to change the sequence of events thatled to some problem in their ‘present’. As I add in sentences amid the alreadywritten text on this computer, what goes before and after reassembles itself toaccommodate the new information. Why can’t this be happening with ‘history’?When consciousness or the Matrix changes another part of the program (the‘past’), the scenes that follow (‘the future’) reassemble themselves in a newway. It is like dominoes falling when the first one is pushed. In other words,our ‘history’ is constantly being rewritten. But let’s go further. Say there wasno Stone Age and that all the archaeological ‘finds’, relics, monoliths and‘evidence’ is merely written into the program at this point (Figure 58). The DNAis constantly receiving information from the Matrix, so ‘history’ at any stageis only what the Matrix chooses to communicate to the DNA and the RNA decides toread. Did ‘yesterday’ really exist as you thought it did or is it just a signalyour DNA is receiving now? But I have ‘memory’, you might say. ‘I rememberyesterday.’ Maybe that’s true, but here’s a question. How can you have a memorywhen there is no time? Memory is a recollection from the past, but there is nopast, only Now. What we think we see at any point are only electrical signalsdecoded by the brain. The signals + interpretation of the signals = reality.image [../Images/00063.jpg]Figure 58: This is a hologram of Egyptian artefacts. What if archaeologicalfinds, relics, monoliths and other ‘historical evidence’ are merely written intothe program at this point? DNA is constantly receiving information from theMatrix, so ‘history’ at any stage is only what the Matrix chooses to communicateto the DNA. Did ‘yesterday’ really exist as you thought it ƠƠ or is it just asignal your DNA is receiving now?(Picture ‘Usheptis’ courtesy of 3-D Hologrammen, Amsterdam. For more seewww.3-Dhologrammen.com [http://www.3-Dhologrammen.com])One other point is worth introducing here. I have mostly been talking about theTime Loop and the Matrix in singular form because I am trying to keep it simple.But there are infinite versions of it in the sense that we interpret the Matrixaccording to our belief and perception. While we may decode the signals to ‘see’the illusion of the same landscape or street scene, we can perceive the detailvery differently, particularly if consciousness is seriously involved in theprocess. Each interpretation creates a different illusory ‘universe’. They maylook like the same one with planets and stars, roads and cars, but they are notthe same. My universe, for example, is, to put it mildly, not the one perceivedin the head of George W. Bush. Each of these interpretations creates whatscientists call a parallel universe, so imagine how many there must be. They areactually parallel imaginations, parallel perceptions or realities, held togetherby the Matrix ‘brain’. There are also other Matrix programs that would beperceived as parallel universes and other dimensions of reality. Asastrophysicist and writer, Giuliana Conforto, said in Organic Universe:> ‘We are not only “inside” one visible matrix, but also in more than one, maybe> in all of them. We might participate in other movies, too, each with its own> event horizon or peculiar frequencies. Matrices are like TV channels.’ A 2002 edition of the BBC science series, Horizon, was devoted to the gatheringacceptance of parallel universes. The opening narrative to the programme said:> ‘For almost a hundred years science has been haunted by a dark secret, that> there might be mysterious, hidden worlds beyond our human senses. Mystics have> long claimed there were such places. They were, they said, full of ghosts and> spirits – but ever since the 19th century physicists have been trying to make> sense of an uncomfortable discovery. When they tried to pinpoint the exact> location of atomic particles like electrons, they found it was utterly> impossible. They had no single location. The only explanation that anyone> could come up with is that the particles don’t just exist in our universe.> They slip into existence in other universes, too, and there are an infinite> number of these parallel universes, all of them slightly different. In effect,> there’s a parallel universe in which Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo; in> another the British Empire held on to its American colonies; in one you were> never born. They are even stranger than Elvis being alive.’ What the narrative is describing are other holographic illusory realities withinthe super-hologram I call the Matrix. Thought creates; emotion creates; theMatrix creates; consciousness creates; and this all is happening within InfiniteConsciousness, the Infinite One. No wonder scientists are bemused anddumbfounded when they try to understand the nature of reality. InfinitePossibility does not ‘do’ rules that you can pin down or record on a data sheet,and they had better get used to it or spend the rest of their lives seekingsomething that isn’t there.So what is real any more? What is truth? Nothing is real except Infinite Love.That is the only truth – everything else is illusion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE Physician, Heal Thy Computer Virus > On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one’s> mind. It becomes a pleasure> Oscar Wilde The human body and its health, or otherwise, can be seen from a massivelydifferent perspective when you realise that reality is illusory and what appearsto be solid is a hologram that only gives the appearance of 3D. ‘Empty’ atoms donot a solid wall make and it’s the same with the ‘body’. It is a frequency fielddecoded into a hologram by other frequency fields called DNA and RNA.This explains so many apparent mysteries, not least in the realm of so-calledalternative or complimentary healing. How can reflexology and acupuncture findpoints throughout the body that relate to all the organs and other functions?How can you massage, or insert a needle at a point on the foot, hand or ear andaffect the liver, stomach or heart? It seems crazy if you accept the officialexplanations of the human form, but it makes perfect sense when you know thebody is a hologram. Remember that one of the amazing properties of holograms isthat every part is a smaller version of the whole. Far from being a mystery thatthe whole body can be found in the foot, hand or ear, it is the way it must beif the body is a hologram. An entire body can be grown from a single cellbecause every cell is a smaller version of the whole and contains all theinformation contained in the whole.On another level, the body is like a smaller (to our reality) version of theearth, the solar system and universe. They, too, are computer programs,operating with or without consciousness, and smaller expressions of thesuper-hologram that I call the Matrix. So the human brain must be a version ofthe Matrix ‘brain’, or central processing unit. Palm reading is based on thissame principle because the hand is a smaller version of the body, but it goesfurther. Every part of the hand, foot and ear also contains the whole and sodoes every part of the finger and every part of every part of the finger down toevery cell, atom and electron. And all these are holographic projections from afrequency field or interference pattern. This means that we affect thesuper-hologram with everything we believe, think or do in the same way that areflexologist can affect the whole body through its ‘parts’. This is how lovecan influence the reality of the Matrix and replace the dominance of fear.In the summer of 2004, I experienced these principles myself when I went tospeak in Hawaii. Well, someone’s got to do it, eh? For several weeks before thetrip my health had been poor. I had severe pain in my spine, especially my neck,and within days of arriving it was excruciating. Anything I did was agony. Evenlying down or driving over a little bump in the road made me feel likescreaming. Fortunately, I went out to Hawaii three weeks before the talk and itgave me time to seek help. Funnily enough, I had been saying for many monthsthat I felt I would have some significant healing in Hawaii and that’s how,thank goodness, it turned out. I was staying on the island of Maui when I wokeup one morning with this overwhelming feeling that I had to go to Big Island, ashort flight away. A few minutes later, Pam came in from checking emails to saythat some friends had invited us to use their house on Big Island while we werein Hawaii. It was the first of many synchronicities that led me to be healed.The day after we arrived at the house my neck and spine worsened rapidly and Iwent to see a chiropractor, desperately seeking relief. He was a guy who was farmore enlightened than conventional chiropractors and manipulating the spine wasonly part of his philosophy. Within a few minutes of our first meeting he alsosuggested that I have a colon cleanse in which a pipe is stuck up your bum toliterally wash out the crap. He said it was a pity because a colon cleanseprogramme had started a few miles away and I had just missed it. In fact, whenwe rang the people involved, there had been two cancellations, allowing Pam andI to take part a day behind all the others. With both the colon cleanse and thechiropractor, the key to my healing was the holographic nature of the body.Most colon cleanses are like wham-bam-thank-you-ma’am, or man. Whack it in, turnit on, whoosh, slosh, yuck, thanks for calling. The best ones do it gently overseveral days, in my case eleven, and clean away the accumulated debris from everfurther inside the colon. I am no expert on what came out to play, but I can saywith certainty that it was better out than in. I’ll spare you the details, muchas I know how interested you must be. One common problem to mention, though, isa sort of mucus that lines the sides of the colon and stops the body absorbingthe goodness in the food. You can eat all the good food you like in that state,but the body sees very little of it in nutrients. On the wall beside me, as thepeaceful waters flowed, was a chart with the colon laid out in sections, eachrelating to different organs and parts of the body – the hologram (Figure 59,overleaf). With every daily session of around two hours, the water goes deeperto clean out more and more of these sections. My general health began to improvein the first few days and my neck and spine improved dramatically when thecleanse reached the area that related to this part of the body. By the end ofthe eleven days my health had not been better for years and my neck and spinewere virtually pain free. At the same time I was seeing the chiropractor. Hecouldn’t touch me to start with, such was the pain, and he said it was one ofthe worst cases he’d seen. But as the colon cleanse did its work he was able tomake his contribution to freeing the neck and spine. In his treatment room wasanother chart, this time with the spine marked out in sections, each relating toan organ or part of the body (Figure 60, overleaf). Wherever you look you seethe hologram, including the eyes (Figure 61, overleaf).image [../Images/00064.jpg]Figure 59: This is the colon chart I saw during my cleanse. Each section relatesto a different area of the body because in a hologram every part contains thewhole(Chart courtesy of the copyright owner, Bernard Jensen International ofCalifornia. To purchase this and other charts see www.bernardjensen.org[http://www.bernardjensen.org] Further details at the back of the book)The chiropractor told me before one manipulation that I might find the spinalmovement emotional because the part of the spine involved was connected toemotion. Sure enough when he clicked that vertebra I began to cry, although Ihad no idea what emotion had triggered it. The colon cleanse was also a veryemotional – even spiritual – experience. In the body hologram everythingconnects to everything else because everything is everything else. We feel fearand nervous emotion in the colon area and some people call it ‘having the shits’or being ‘shit scared’. This is most appropriate because as the water cleans outthe stored physical shit that has not been processed, so it unlocks theemotional shit that has not processed. The physical always reflects the mentaland emotional because they are expressions of the same DNA communication network– the same hologram. There is a point in the cleanse where they focus on thesection of the colon that represents the liver, and this also coincides withanother process that directly cleanses the liver itself with a concoction youdrink the night before. This can be very intense physically and emotionallybecause the liver processes toxins and is known as the seat of anger. Whileeverything reflects everything else, the different organs specialise in certainthings. For example, the whole body is a DNA computer system receiving andtransmitting information, but the brain is the central processing unit thatspecialises in communication traffic. The liver is the toxin-removal specialistand that includes an emotional toxin – anger.image [../Images/00065.jpg]Figure 60: The spine, too, represents the whole body. For example, T7 in thecentre affects the pancreas, duodenum, stomach, liver, spleen, gallbladder andperitoneum(Chart courtesy of copyright owner, Koren Publications, Surrey, England.

To purchase this and other charts see www.bernardjensen.org[http://www.bernardjensen.org] Further details at the back of the book)The gall bladder, which is part of the liver, produces fluid called bile andwhen we are describing someone venting anger we talk of them being full of bile.Our everyday phrases describe many literal and symbolic truths without usrealising. The liver dumps its toxins into the colon to be discharged, but whenthe discharged, but when the colon is blocked, or if the body is massivelytoxic, there is more poison than can be processed. The liver deals with this byproducing little ‘stones’ made from hardened bile or minerals to block bloodvessels and stop the toxins re-entering the bloodstream. As the flow of blood issuppressed, the body protects the torso first, and the extremities becomestarved of optimum blood supply with many potential consequences. Once the colonhas been cleaned out, the liver is confident enough to dump more of its storedtoxins into the exit system, and sometimes thousands of these little stones,together with the toxins, are washed from the body. That certainly happened toPam and me. The difference in health is amazing, not least in the glow of theskin as its blood supply increases. My friends couldn’t believe how much betterI was looking.Pam had suffered for some years from a skin disorder called Rosacea, whichconventional ‘medicine’ says is incurable and can only be kept in check byconstant antibiotics. But her condition disappeared in days with the coloncleanse because it is caused by toxins in the liver. If the build-up of toxinsis not dealt with, especially if you have a very toxic lifestyle, the livereventually becomes overwhelmed and the body dies from liver failure. Anger is anemotional toxin that creates physical toxin because they are one and the same.When I had my liver cleanse and the stones and toxins poured out, so did mypent-up anger. For 48 hours I was in a barely-suppressed rage of thechair-throwing variety. If you have a serious liver cleanse lock away thecrockery. I stress again that emotion, be it anger, depression, whatever, is nota function of what I am calling consciousness beyond the hologram. Emotions areprogrammed reactions transmitted through DNA. Love and emotion is not the samething, nor is emotion and empathy, and I will expand on this later. Manypharmaceutical drugs/toxins have been linked with depression, but how can drugsand poisons directly affect consciousness? They can’t. What they do is affectthe DNA’s decoding system and, through that, produce the feeling of depressionand other psychological consequences in the emotion program. It is like acomputer malfunction.During the colon cleanse, and on many other occasions, I have met healers whobelieve that different parts of the body have their own brain. They say thedigestive system has a brain, as does the immune system, liver and other organs.This must be the case because the body is a hologram and this is why theseorgans and systems have the ability to communicate and react to events andchanges in the most extraordinary way. The hologram ensures that there willindeed be a smaller version of the brain in every part of the body. The DNA/RNAcommunicates and receives information to and from every part of the body and thebrain acts as coordinator. When the colon is blocked and the liver has nowhereto send its toxins this information is communicated through the body’s‘Internet’ system and the computer takes the appropriate action. We see this asliver stones. In this case it is akin to a computerised canal system in whichthe sluice gates are closed in reaction to changing circumstances.The process of healing wounds, stopping blood loss and all the billions of otherways the body reacts, is the DNA/RNA communicating information in accordancewith the program. One other point to remember is that the body/hologram istwo-thirds water. This is essential to every function of the body, includingmaintenance of temperature, and, as Masaru Emoto’s work has established, waterstores information. It is also a superb medium through which to transmit theelectrical and other frequency signals passing around the DNA. The body in thissense is like a battery and when the water levels fall because we don’t drinkenough it has a similar effect to a car battery with too little distilled water– it doesn’t work as well. Among the many signs and symptoms of too little waterin the body are headaches, poor concentration and tiredness. All are the resultof the DNA communications falling below optimum. But let us not forget that eventhis is only happening in our heads and, on a higher level of awareness, that’sillusion also.In a healthy body the DNA is communicating accurately between different parts ofthe computer through the RNA, and what is termed disease, or dis-ease, is whenthe system malfunctions. There are endless causes for this, but all have thesame theme: they affect the accuracy of the information passing through theDNA/RNA. People who live near power lines or work with electromagnetictechnology are more prone to certain ailments and cancers. In Britain, they areinstalling a stream of so-called Tetra masts as part of the communicationnetwork for the emergency services. The masts emit pulses in the frequency rangeof human brain waves. I have been told that the technology was introducedthrough the US National Security Agency, a 100 per cent Illuminati-controlledoperation. This makes sense because the Tetra masts are quite rightly beingconnected with increases in cancers and other physical, mental and emotionaldisorders – including depression – where they are located.The reason for these effects is that electromagnetic, microwave and otherfrequencies disrupt the input/output system of DNA/RNA, and the computer givesand receives inaccurate information. It’s like talking on a mobile phone whenthe connection is bad. You only catch certain words and you can’t understandwhat the other person is trying to say. In the human body these disruptedcommunications act like a computer virus and this is what cancer is. Cells areconstantly reproducing and all is well while they are copied accurately. Forthis to happen, the DNA/RNA communication to the cell needs to be accurate. Oncean electromagnetic field or other source disrupts the quality of theinformation, the cell begins to reproduce flawed copies, often at inappropriatespeeds and we call this cancer. It can spread like a computer virus affectingever greater areas of the program until the computer can no longer function. Ihad a virus in a computer that began with a slight disruption and gathered paceuntil you could not even switch the thing on. And what do we say in thosecircumstances? The computer is dead. So it is with the body.The potential for the malfunction we call illness is immense in the ‘modern’world because of the way society is structured. We are told that stress is agreat killer. Yes it is – but why? When emotions get out of balance they beginto affect the communication network. One of the first places to be troubled isthe intestinal area with ‘butterflies in the stomach’, fear, nausea and ‘theshits’. This is okay so long as it is within reason and not a constant burden tothe system. But when the stress reaches seriously high levels, and especially ifit’s ongoing, a much wider area of the system begins to malfunction. We see skinrashes, stomach ulcers, cancer and that major expression of stress – heartdisease.There is also another aspect to emotional disease that I experienced in Hawaii.In the chiropractor’s waiting room was a book by Dr John E. Sarno, Professor ofClinical Rehabilitation Medicine at the New York University School of Medicineand attending physician at the Howard A. Rusk Institute of RehabilitationMedicine at New York University Medical Center. It was called Healing Back Pain:The Mind-Body Connection (Warner Books, 1991), and detailed his more than 20years of research linking pain to the mind/brain. For sure, it is the brain thatmanifests pain by decoding the messages sent from the apparent source ofdiscomfort. When you bang your toe you don’t actually feel the pain until thebrain has processed the message and decided it hurts. One way that severe painis treated is by stopping the messages from, say an arthritic knee, from beingcommunicated to the brain. Without the message there can be no pain. If you canuse your consciousness to change the belief system of the brain you can walkthrough fire without being burned. Many people do firewalking across red hotcoals without feeling any heat, let alone discomfort. They are walking throughthe fire only in their heads and whether it hurts or not is decided by the waytheir brain interprets reality. There are those, like some Yogis and Tibetanmonks, who can slow their heart rate to almost nil, sit naked in freezingweather and consciously generate such internal heat that they can dry wet towelslaid on their backs. They are using their consciousness to override the programand wrest control of their reality from the Matrix.Dr John E. Sarno identified the connection between mind and body and how mentaland emotional states can lead to physical consequences. Sarno’s findings, backedup by two decades of successfully treating ‘untreatable’ cases, suggest that themajor cause of pain in the back, neck, shoulders, bum and limbs is repressedemotion. The chiropractor told me how he had suffered from severe back pain thatnothing would alleviate until he read Sarno’s book. He followed the advice toidentify the emotions that were being suppressed and he realised he had been infear of something without even knowing. Once he made the connection the backpain disappeared. This is how Sarno has successfully treated many thousands ofpatients without surgery or drugs even though conventional medicine said theywere incurable.The act of observation and identification of the emotional cause unlocks theinformation stored in the hologram (hard drive) and allows it to be deleted.When the data recording the emotional response is removed, its ‘physical’expression disappears just as quickly. The chiropractor’s wife had beensuffering from serious neck pain and he could do nothing to help her until theyconnected the problem to the death of her cat some weeks earlier. She’d had thecat since it was born and the loss caused severe emotional trauma, even morethan she realised. When the link had been acknowledged her extreme neck pain wasgone. It’s funny how we say of people who cause us emotional upset orfrustration: ‘They are a pain in the neck’. I also saw the connection between myown neck and spine problems and serious emotional challenges I had beenexperiencing for weeks before. Again this is the interaction of the mind andemotional programs of the DNA and how they disrupt the balance and accuracy ofthe communications.You can experience this interaction just by thinking of something sad,depressing or frightening. It doesn’t have to be happening because your thoughtsalone are enough to trigger the emotional response. Scientists have establishedthat the same parts of the brain ‘light up’ whether a person is actually havingan experience or just thinking about it. The Illuminati are constantlymanipulating this system by delivering information to the collective minddesigned to trigger the desired collective emotional reaction. Healer MikeLambert also points out that the areas of the body that Dr. Sarno treats mosteffectively are directly connected in acupuncture to the gall bladder (a sourceof depression when imbalanced) and the liver (a source of anger whenimbalanced). The interconnection between body and emotion through the DNA meansthat emotions can affect the body and the body can affect emotions. Toxins inthe cells can cause depression and anger while this – and all emotion –stimulates the release of chemicals that are absorbed by the cells. Talk about avicious cycle. But it can be broken by consciousness.Interestingly, the study of the body’s meridian system at the Necker Hospital inParis using the radioactive tracers revealed that energy passed more slowlythrough the meridian of a diseased organ than it did through a healthy one. MikeLambert also told me of experiments that showed how e-motion-al states causedthe flow of information – motion – around the body to slow down. As this vibrantmovement of information is curtailed, the body computer malfunctions and soemotional al stress causes illness. Heart attacks in particular are caused bystatic energy and this is how those with severe grief are said to have ‘died ofa broken heart’ soon after they lose a loved one. The slower the energy movesthe slower the vibrational state of the body and we get pulled further intodensity. When we are in a depressed or emotionally stressed state we actuallytalk about ‘feeling heavy’. Rigid opinions and suppression of free thought andaction also stem the flow and cause the hologram to vibrate slower. ValerieHunt, Professor of Kinesiology at the University of California in Los Angeles,has developed the use of technology to measure the human energy field and thishas confirmed that a person’s state of being effects their vibrational speed orfrequency. Those focused only on five-sense reality (mind and emotions) haveenergy fields that vibrate at a lower frequency than those who use their highersenses (consciousness). As humans became dominated by fear, so they fell furtherinto density (the ‘Fall of Man’??).Chemicals in food and drink also emit frequencies that disrupt the informationflow and the appalling ‘food’ produced by the Illuminati corporations isdestroying human health. Everything in the Matrix is a frequency carrying aharmonious or disruptive resonance. With chemical food it’s the latter and thiscan quickly undermine the input/output signals of the DNA/RNA. Morgan Spurlock’smovie, Super Size Me (see supersizeme.com [http://supersizeme.com]), revealedthe devastating effects on the body of eating fast food. The New Yorker atethree meals at McDonalds every day for a month and his health was monitored bydoctors. The outcome was devastating. Within days he went from being a fit,healthy 33-year-old, to vomiting, suffering headaches and depression, and losinghis sex drive. His liver became overwhelmed by saturated fats and Dr DarylIsaacs described Spurlock’s liver test as shocking. ‘It became very, veryabnormal’, he said. Spurlock put on a lot of weight in just one month and hesaid he became desperately ill. ‘My face was splotchy and I had this huge gut,which I’ve never had in my life’, he said. ‘It was amazing – and reallyfrightening.’ Goodness knows what the health effects are going to be on today’sfast-food chomping, cola-swigging, chemical-riddled generation. You might note,too, that Spurlock said that he became depressed while on his fast food diet.This was the chemicals affecting the DNA communications we call emotion.The computer I am working on now is protected by software called NortonAntiVirus. It seeks out disruptive codes and information that would normallyspread like cancer through the computer until it eventually ‘died’. The body hasits version of Norton, too. It is called the Immune System. This is the softwarethat seeks out the body’s version of the computer virus and removes it before itgets out of control. But, as with the liver, the immune system can become sodeluged that it can’t cope, and it also faces attacks that undermine its ownstrength and efficiency. When this happens disease runs rampant, as we see withthe immune destroyer known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.People don’t die from AIDS; they die from diseases that their shot immunesystems can’t deal with. Ironically, vaccinations are supposed to boost theimmune system when, in truth, they undermine it. All the crap they put intovaccines is another attack that the immune defence has to cope with and thisreduces its ability to meet other challenges effectively by making the DNA/RNAmisfire.Even the process of making the vaccine includes using monkeys, chick embryos andsurgically aborted human foetuses, along with disinfectants and stabilizers thatinclude streptomycin, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, aluminium,hydrochloride, sorbitol, hydrolyzed gelatin, formaldehyde and a mercuryderivative called thimerosal. The Diphtheria, Pertussis (whooping cough) andTetanus vaccine contains the following:> Sodium Hydroxide: among other things, this can burn internal organs, cause> blindness, lung and tissue damage, and be fatal if swallowed. It is found in> oven, bathroom and toilet cleaners.> Formaldehyde: a neurotoxin known to cause cancer. It may also cause insomnia,> coughing, headaches, nausea, nosebleeds and skin rashes. It is, appropriately,> used to embalm corpses.> Hydrochloric acid: this can destroy tissue on direct contact and is found in> aluminium cleaners and rust removers.> Aluminium: toxic cancer causer.> Thimerosal: a mercury derivative and extremely dangerous preservative. It is> made from a combination of ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and ethanol,> thiosalicylic acid, sodium hydroxide and ethyl mercuric chloride. These> chemicals are deadly and can cause cancer together with brain and liver> damage.> Phosphates: these suffocate all forms of aquatic life and are found in laundry> and dishwasher detergent and cleaners.> (For more details see www.vaccinationnews.com/dailynews/may2001/whatsinvax.htm> [http://www.vaccinationnews.com/dailynews/may2001/whatsinvax.htm]) This poisonous trash is attacking the very immune system it is supposed to besupporting and yet in fascist-controlled America parents are being taken tocourt for not allowing such potential killers to be given to their children. Thepublic is frightened into accepting this tyranny by being told of the potentialeffects on their children of coming into contact with non-immunised kids. But ifthey’ve been vaccinated, there shouldn’t be a problem should there? It’s thesame with the drugs peddled by the Illuminati pharmaceutical cartel. The reasonthey ‘treat’ one problem and cause another is because the drugs disrupt theinformation passing through the DNA/RNA. You had this problem and now we’vetreated you and we’ve given you a few more. But never mind, we have drugs forthem, too.One of the biggest killers and causes of illness is pharmaceutical drugs. DrBruce H. Pomeranz, principal investigator and a neuroscience professor at theUniversity of Toronto, headed one study that revealed how more than 100,000Americans are killed by pharmaceutical drugs every year and some 2.1 million areseriously harmed. Other studies put the number much higher. The figures did notinclude prescribing errors or drug abuse, only those killed or adverselyaffected by what was supposed to be an accepted treatment and dose for theircondition. This made doctors’ prescriptions the sixth biggest cause of death inthe United States behind heart disease, cancer, lung disease, strokes andaccidents. These are the same doctors, within the same cartel-controlled medicalindustry, that condemn alternative therapies as dangerous quackery! Look at theway they treat cancer in the butchers’ shops of conventional medicine. They usechemotherapy and that’s just another way of saying they poison people.Chemotherapy kills cells. Er, that’s it. I don’t mean just cancer cells, but allcells. ‘Modern medicine’ simply hopes that this horrific poison will kill thecancer cells before it has killed enough healthy ones to kill the patient.Subtle, eh?‘Hey Ethel, I’ve got a cure for your headache.’‘Oh great, Chuck, what is it?’‘I got this shotgun and I’m going to blow your friggin’ head off.’‘Gee, thanks, Chuck … you’d make a wonderful doctor.’But it gets even more ridiculous when you realise that chemotherapy also killsthe cells that form the immune system. Even if your ‘chemo’ does manage to killthe cancer cells before it kills you, the immune system, your defence againstcancer and disease, looks like a scene from the Battle of the Somme. This is thevery environment in which cancer and other disease can flourish unchallenged. Isaw a documentary once that showed the immune system’s white blood cellsdestroying cancer cells. This is an everyday occurrence. When your immune systemis working properly you don’t die from cancer because the problem is nipped inthe bud. It is when the system is undermined or overwhelmed by multiple attacksthat the defences are breached, and our Illuminati-created societies aredesigned to do precisely that with all the shite food, drink, stress andelectromagnetic pollution. The drug thalidomide rewrote the DNA/RNA program inunborn children to such an extent that they were born without limbs and, for thesame reason, the radiation scattered across Iraq by American and British weaponscontaining spent uranium has led to the unspeakable birth defects in childrenthat I highlighted in Tales from the Time Loop. Radiation short-circuits DNAcommunication.What we call genetic diseases are flaws in the parents’ DNA passed to the childwhen the two ‘disks’ are downloaded onto one in what we call procreation.Genetic disease is an inherited problem with the DNA’s ability to communicateaccurately and, depending on what form this takes, the child becomes more liableto manifest a particular disease. The current attacks on the DNA by theIlluminati are likely to lead to an increase in genetic flaws because of thechanges being caused by our food, drink, electromagnetic pollution and otherenvironmental factors. But, and it’s a very big but, this doesn’t have to be. Wecan use our consciousness to dictate the program and wrest control from foodadditives or any other disruptive influence. Consciousness is not more powerfulthan a Tetra mast or a chemical sweetener? Please.Japanese scientist, Masaru Emoto, has found that low frequency water reactsextremely negatively when exposed to low frequencies; but high frequency wateris not affected at all by low frequencies. This makes sense because they are noton the same wavelength and when we operate in high frequency states we are notaffected by the low frequency bombardment in our food, drink and environment. AsI said earlier, Valerie Hunt, professor of kinesiology at the University ofCalifornia in Los Angeles, has found that people focused only on five-sensereality (mind and emotions) have energy fields that vibrate at a lower frequencythan those who use their higher senses (consciousness). This whole Illuminatiglobal society is designed to keep us in a low frequency state so we play bytheir rules in their vibratory realm.I am all for the development of what is called alternative, or complementary,healing. These are the healing techniques that treat the body as a series ofvibrational fields, which can be harmonised through hands-on healing(transmitting energy to the patient); acupuncture (rebalancing energy flows andDNA/RNA communication); reflexology (using a smaller version of the hologram totreat the whole); aromatherapy (accessing the hologram through the sense ofsmell); and the countless other methods that operate on the same principles. Butthese are not the end in themselves. They are stepping-stones to the realisationthat we can use our consciousnesses to heal ourselves. DNA is areceiver/transmitter/amplifier and it can either be aligned to the transmissionsof the Matrix and its inherited ‘genetic’ program, or to Infinite Consciousness.We can allow the Matrix to communicate to our DNA and dictate events, and flawsin the DNA to control our life; or we can impose our consciousness on thesituation and change the outcome. It is not DNA that is the problem, but what iscommunicating with it and disrupting its balance. There is no need to cut outbits of the body to ‘cure’ people. We just have to restore vibrational harmonyto replace the disharmony that causes dis-ease. And we do that throughvibrational means, not the scalpel and the drug.Consciousness has the power to communicate its will to DNA and override thedictates of the Matrix and the inherited software. We can rebalance the DNA andheal ourselves – and even stop the illusory ageing process – by sendingdifferent instructions and rewriting the program. We can be governor of our ownexperience even within the Matrix if we choose to wake up from our hypnoticstate. A computer may be able to do some amazing things, but in the end you arein control of it. Type in the right codes and it works perfectly. Type in thewrong ones and it can go haywire. It is the same with the body hologram. The DNAis a transmitter/receiver and it does not have an exclusive contract with anysingle broadcaster. Are we going to allow the Matrix to dictate events throughour DNA or are we, Infinite Consciousness, going to intervene and demand ourright to decide our own experience? Are we going to ride the horse or go onletting the horse ride us?Now, let’s go to another level with this because what I have been describing arealso illusions. When you deprogram still further you realise that there is noillness because there is no body. How can your body be ill when you haven’t gotone?‘Good morning, doctor; I have a pain in my belly.’‘Madam, you don’t have a belly so it cannot hurt.’‘Thank you, doctor; I think that’s cured it.’Illness, like everything else except Infinite Love, is illusion. We only get illbecause the program tells us to believe we can get ill. It is feeding us thatreality and our DNA/RNA is decoding the messages into our apparent 3Dexperience. My DNA/RNA is manifesting the illusion that I have arthritis anduntil I can disconnect from that reality at a deep level my joints will remainswollen and painful. I have said that we see with our brain and not our eyes.But here’s another little shocker. There are no eyes. If reality is constructedin our brain how can we have any eyes on the outside of the brain? Look in themirror and you can see your eyes, but everything you are seeing is happeninginside your brain – including the eyes staring back at you in the mirror. Peoplewho have ‘near death’ or ‘out-of-body’ experiences describe how they could stillsee while they were looking down at their bodies lying on the operating table orwherever. If we see with our eyes, or indeed even our brain, how come we can seewithout them? Because they are another level of the illusion. I am sitting herenow wearing reading-glasses so that I can see the computer screen because ‘myeyes are not what they were’. But how can my eyes not be what they were whenthey never were in the first place?We are told that light comes in through the eyes and is turned into electricalsignals that the brain decodes. On one level of the illusion that does appear tohappen; but go higher and there are no eyes so how can they process ‘light’?There is no ‘light’ as there is no ‘dark’. They, too, are illusions. People goblind when they have a defect in the eyes for the same reason that I havearthritis. The belief that you need eyes to see is written into the program andthe DNA/RNA decodes this as blindness when the illusory eyes appear tomalfunction. Only consciousness can change that by overriding the software. LikeI say, the brain is another level of the illusion sold to us by the Matrix. Itis the body computer’s central processing unit decoding the false realitybroadcast by the Matrix into the ‘world’ we think we see. But the brain is alsoa hologram and therefore an illusion. There are many levels to the maze and whenyou peel them away you are left with only Infinite Consciousness – InfiniteLove.The world looks a lot less scary when you realise there is no world, eh? And thefear of death loses its power when you know that you have no body and so itcannot ‘die’. What a hoot it all is, this ‘life’ we take so seriously. Go on,have a good laugh, mate; it’s bloody hysterical.Note: When I had completed this book and it entered the production stage, I sawreviews on the Internet about a book called Vernetzte Intelligenz, which detailsthe findings of Russian scientists and researchers with regard to DNA. Theirdiscoveries support the theme of DNA as a ‘biological Internet’, and you willfind a summary of their work in Appendix I.It is worth reading Appendix I on page 199 before proceeding because it closelyrelates to much that you have read so far."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX The God Program > It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom. He is spared> the sight of the horror of his harvest> Oscar Wilde One of the major expressions of the Matrix program in this reality is what wecall Religion, and that’s not only Christianity, Judaism, Islam and the otherswe associate with that term. I also mean the religions we call money, politics,the pursuit of ‘success’, television, the cult of celebrity and what has beendubbed the ‘New Age’. Anything, in fact, that dictates your sense of reality andentraps you in the illusion.The Matrix loves religions. They are the diversions that hold consciousness inthe headlights of an oncoming fairytale. Which fairytale you choose to believedoesn’t much matter so long as you buy into one of them and, of course, your DNAis always there to guide you. The idea is to keep you focused on one obsessionso you don’t see the guy at the stove preparing the gravy. Horses have wideperipheral vision and some wear blinkers to ensure they can only see what’s infront of them and not the panorama they would normally see. The blinkers arethere to focus the horse on the desired activity – the race – and stop it beingdistracted by other horses or influences. The religions in all their forms areblinkers for humans. They are there to discourage consciousness from seeingbeyond the program because they are focused on one predominant belief or goal.The Silent Weapons for a Quiet War document said: ‘Keep them busy, busy, busy,back on the farm with the other animals’. The Matrix wants to keep the cell doorbolted and religions have served the cause magnificently. They entrap people inlaws, irrelevance, and fine detail to such an extent that the big picture isnever seen (Figure 62, overleaf).A great example of this is hair. I didn’t realise that hair was so importantuntil I began to check what different religions told their followers to believeabout it. The things you learn. Did you know that the Torah (the five books of‘Moses’ in the Old Testament) forbids a male Jew from removing hair from hissideburns? No, really, this must be very profound then, I guess. But why, dearGod, is this considered so vital? Well the Torah, no, let’s be specific,Leviticus 19:27, says: ‘Do not shave around the sides of your head, nor harm theedges of your beard’. Is that it? Yep, seems like it. If you really study thedetail, though, there are some get-out clauses. Phew. The sideburns merely haveto be long enough that you can pull on the hair; and the beard can be shaved,but only if you use an instrument that isn’t sharp. Mmmm. Is it me or do you seethe same contradiction here? But this is God’s law and there can be nocontradictions, so it must be us, I suppose. The law says you must not use astraight razor, including safety-razors, on your temples or to shave your beard.Jewish men who don’t want a beard have various options, I read. They can use‘depilatory powder’ (hair removal products), or scissors with ‘two relativelydull blades to pinch off the hair, rather than one very sharp blade slicing itoff’. Ouch. There is some good news, though – electric shavers are okay! Yippee.But hold on. Aren’t they sharp so they can cut the hair, isn’t that the idea?God must have missed that one. Not all electric shavers are within the law andyou are advised apparently to check with your local Orthodox rabbi foracceptable brands. He might have a stock in the back room. The Devil’s in thedetail so here’s some more from faqs.org:> ‘Actually, the sideburns merely have to be long enough that one can pull on> the hair, and the beard area can be shaved with something other than a sharp> blade (many people accept the use of electric shavers). But, specifically> within the Chassidic community, there is a custom not to shave (and frequently> not even to trim) the beard, and to permit the sideburn area (all the way up> to the top of the ear) to grow long as well (the long sideburns are called> peyos). Some tuck the hair up under their kippa/skullcap, while others curl> the hair. Many Orthodox say the payos (aka earlocks/sidelocks) begin right at> the temple, to just behind the ear, and must grow no shorter than the top of> the cheekbone. Then they are to be worn pushed forward of the ear so as to be> visible … Many who grow long peyos do so for Kabbalistic reasons. One of the> opinions in Kabbalah is that the peyos need to be worn long only until the> beard grows in. Once the beard grows, the peyos of the side of the head should> not be allowed to grow down beyond where the sides of the beard begin to> appear.’1 image [../Images/00067.jpg]Figure 62: ‘We will now sing hymn 364 – The Lord is My Shepherd’Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Has he finished yet? All these laws about the hair on your faceare only one example of the web of control, often fine-detailed control,provided through the God Program software and it’s not only Jewish people whohave their lives dictated in this way. Muslims wear beards, too, and the Korantells them what to think, as the Torah and other blinker-books tell Jews andChristians. I typed the question, ‘Why do Muslims wear beards?’ into Google andsaw that many don’t seem to know. But one guy, Dr Muzaffar Iqbal, thefounder-president of the Center for Islam and Science in Canada, did offer anexplanation in his column in the New Islamabad. In summary, he says that Muslimsshould be inspired to be like the Prophet and, ‘when applied to the outwardaspects’, this meant that such a person ‘makes an effort to change one’s habits,dress, appearance and routines of the day to a close resemblance to the life ofthe Prophet, upon whom be peace and blessings’. Beards for men were one suchattribute, said the doctor, in line with the Prophet’s command reported inBukhari, Book 72, no. 781: ‘Trim your moustaches and leave the beard [as itis]’.2 Well, some guy in the seventh century is reported to have said don’t trimyour beard, so who are we to question it? No wonder the word ‘Muslim’ means ‘Onewho surrenders’.So now we have Jews being told by the Torah to wear beards and Muslims told bythe Koran. The hair thing is just as important to Sikhs, too. At least Jews andMuslims can cut the hair on their heads, but not so with Sikhs. They are tobarbers what vegans are to the meat industry. Sikhs don’t cut their hair andinstead gather it together under a turban. They also go for the Long BeardProgram. One reason for this is that if hair wasn’t pleasing to God, they ask,why did he cause it to grow? The Sikh gurus (see rabbis, priests and clerics)strongly advised Sikhs to accept God’s will (common to all versions of the GodProgram) and not cutting the hair symbolises this, so I read. Sikhs believe thatGod didn’t make any mistakes in how he created the human form (George W. Bush, Irest my case) and out of respect for that belief Sikhs choose to keep theirbodies unchanged from the way God created them. This includes the fact that Sikhmen remain uncircumcised, except for medical reasons (I thought God didn’t makemistakes …). But as with all belief when faced with practicality, they pepper inthe contradictions to get themselves out of the dogma-created holes. Forinstance, they say that if God didn’t want hair to grow why did he make it grow?But I have a question: why do Sikhs cut their nails then? Have no fear, theyhave considered the fine print and there is an answer to this contradiction thatI have, once again, quite wrongly identified. A Sikh website exposed the errorof my observation:> ‘Sikhism believes in having a truthful, honest living and progressing in life.> Nails have been given to us so that we may work and walk. For example, if you> lift any object up with your fingers you will see the pressure on your nails.> Nails also help us to walk. If you decide not to cut your nails, when you work> they will eventually snap off. So therefore Sikhism allows them to be cut.’ I wonder how long the lawyers worked on that one. I also read how some believethe hair must not be cut because it is an antenna that connects us to God. Sowhere does that leave bald people? What have they done for God to block theire-mails? But, not to worry, the hairless can make contact with another part ofthe God Program by being a Buddhist. They have no problem with baldies.Buddhists shave their heads to ‘renounce all the mundane desires and longings tomore readily achieve purity, be free from delusions, remove hindrances and enterthe way of practice’. And once they shave their heads, they can easily bedistinguished from others (if not from each other). Roman Catholic nuns also cuttheir hair as a symbol of their life of self-sacrifice to God and renunciationof worldly things. A woman’s hair is considered her crowning glory and is oftena source of vanity, the Roman Catholic thought-police say. In order to avoidthis vanity the nun covers her head and cuts her hair short. Now what’s the wordI am looking for with all this? Oh yeah, pathetic.image [../Images/00068.jpg]Figure 63: The Matrix God Program … Worship MEEEEE!The scale of religious imposition can be breathtaking and its underlying weaponis always the fear equation: fear = control = power for the Matrix (Figure 63).Firstly, the God Program puts its followers in a state of fear about upsettingGod and missing out on the ticket to paradise. Then it gives them rules tofollow to keep God sweet and save them from the place where the fires burn. DeanHamer, an American molecular geneticist, concluded after comparing more than2,000 DNA samples that a person’s capacity to believe in God is linked to brainchemicals. He explained his theory in The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired intoour Genes (Doubleday, 2004). This certainly fits with what I am suggesting inthis book. The God Program will be more powerful in some people than othersbecause the realisation that religion is nonsense rewrites the DNA software anddilutes the influence of the men in frocks on others in the same genetic line.It also works the other way, too, of course. I am not surprised that Hamerconnects belief in God to brain chemicals because this is a way the softwareinteracts with the body hologram.In September 2004, I saw a television documentary series called Jewish Law, onBritain’s Channel 4. What it revealed was a fantastic example of what I mean byreligions serving the Matrix. The series featured Jewish people trying to followthe strict Judaistic law in every area of their lives. And I mean every. It wasso extreme it was almost funny, but by the end I found myself deeply sad forthese people. They are imprisoned in a daily dictatorship of fear, based on lawsdecreed through ancient Biblical texts written thousands of years ago by unknownauthors and administered by the Rabbinical Thought Police. Early in the firstshow we found Rabbi Kaye, a kosher-inspector for an organisation called Beth Dinin Manchester in the North West of England. He was in his library where theshelves were packed with books detailing the shoulds and shouldn’ts, musts andmustn’ts, which an orthodox Jew has to observe. He said:> ‘This book here actually tells us what you do when you get up in the morning,> how one gets dressed, how one acts – before praying in the morning we don’t> eat – how you can greet someone in the morning, what you can say before you> pray, what you can’t say, how you get to the synagogue, what you do in the> synagogue, what happens if you turn up a little late for prayers, what bits> you miss out, all these things are all there.’ You get the picture. The Beth Din organisation employs 30 ‘dietary inspectors’to police the establishments where kosher food and drink is produced. Youprobably know about the kosher meat laws which insist that animals are bled todeath, like the halal meat of the Muslims – but kosher law goes much furtherthan the technique of slaughter. It ensures that everything conforms to theastonishingly voluminous and complex dietary laws written down more than tencenturies ago. As Beth Din’s Rabbi Furst said: ‘We have a tradition given downto us from Mount Sinai. When God gave Moses the written Torah he also gave himan oral explanation of all of this in the tiniest, tiniest detail.’ It must havebeen a long conversation from what I could see and Moses must have had a memoryto die for. Rabbi Furst also explained that the law allowed them to eat part ofan insect, but not a whole one. I’m not sure there is much good news there,really. Kosher food-inspector, Rabbi Klarberg, added the rider that this did notmean they could purposely cut up an insect to find a loophole in the law thatsays you can’t eat a whole one. I breathed deeply wondering if I had morphed toanother planet. Why anyone would want to circumvent a law that says you can’teat an insect was lost on me. But then I was in really strange territory.Sholem Josephs, of the Swiss Cottage Bakery, said that if he had meat in one ofhis ovens he wouldn’t dare bake anything else in there until he had called therabbi and agreed a way to make the oven kosher again. He also pointed out thatkosher food costs more, not least because, like all such businesses, he isbilled every month by Beth Din for policing his kitchens and giving the crucialstamp of approval. Maintaining the kosher eating laws is very profitable as wellas being spectacularly over the top. But how can you question Moses or whoeverinvented him? That would be blasphemy. In another scene, a guy was visiting arabbi with a new electric kettle. Rabbi Brodie explained to him that Jewishpots, pans and kettles were immersed in a body of water because it wasconsidered a sign of purity. I think it’s what the rest of us call cleaning newpans before you use them. But no, this was a spiritual and religious ritual. ‘Ihope you have many, many good cups of tea from it’, the rabbi said. ‘Havingsanctified it, I’m sure the tea will taste better.’Soon we were back with kosher-inspector, Rabbi Kaye, and the drama heightened.He faced a serious problem. A rabbi in London who was flying up to join him thenext morning for an inspection in Aberdeen, Scotland, was worried that hisflight time would stop him from praying when the law said he must. He would haveto leave home before it was time to pray and would be in the air at the criticalmoment. I didn’t understand why he couldn’t just pray on the plane, something Ihave done many times myself while flying with local airlines in South America.From what I gathered – and it did get a bit garbled at this stage – the rabbihad to pray in the first four hours after dawn. God demanded this, apparently.Rabbi Kaye went to work to solve his friend’s crisis. He opened the Hebrewcalendar on his laptop and there was great relief. There was a way around it.Somehow you always knew there would be.In his hotel room, as he waited for the London guy, Rabbi Kaye covered his headand performed the first of the obligatory three prayers of the day – as opposedto the five of the Muslims (I wonder who wins on penalties?). The rabbi’s prayerinvolved rocking back and forth in the way I have seen them do at the WailingWall in Jerusalem. At one point, he also wore a sort of little black chimney orbox thing which are collectively known as tefillin. It was a square, and farsmaller, version of the top hat worn by the Fat Controller in Thomas the TankEngine. In another programme we were told more about why Jewish men ‘strap onboxes’, as the narrator put it. This immediately took my mind to cricket,baseball and other sports in which the manhood has to be protected from injuryby a hard ‘box’ or cup. But these tefillin do not protect the balls, theyperpetuate it. They contain little compartments each filled with a parchmentinscribed with religious texts and they are worn to remind Jews that God rescuedthem from bondage in Egypt. He was obviously on vacation when the Babyloncaptivity deal went down.The legitimacy of the tefillin has to be checked regularly. Rabbi Dansky told usthat this must be done because if you don’t follow the will of God you earn ‘nobrownie points’. Hold on a second while I come to terms with how stupid this Godmust be, what a total wally-brain, to be concerned about whether anyone wearsthis thing on their head or what is in it. Nope, that level of ludicrousness isbeyond my imagination. Anyway, Rabbi Dansky is nothing if not thorough. We sawhim with his measuring gauge to ensure the tefillin were square to within onemillimetre. He said they don’t really understand why they have to be square, itwas a mitzvah (law) decreed some three thousand years ago that ‘we just have toaccept and do without [knowing]’. You suspect there are a lot of those. Eachscroll had to be in the right order or the tefillin would be invalid, the samewith even a small scuff on the leather chin strap, the rabbi said. When theywear out they have to be buried, even the little stitches that become detached.Rabbi Dansky told us that he made sure this happened by hoovering his office andburying the dustbag. He seemed to bury quite a lot. He said that all old prayerbooks, even newspaper articles about the Torah, had to be buried, too. Theprevious year he had buried seven tons of the stuff.Rabbi Kaye and his London friend headed for the fish market in Aberdeen. Thevoice-over told us that in order to be kosher the fish had to have fins andscales. I thought what a relief it must have been to find that they had, notleast for the fish. This statement was given no elaboration and I take it thismeant the fish had to have fins and scales when on the dinner plate, but I can’tbe sure. Every additive to the fish and every other kosher food has to bechecked. Kosher certificates must be going out thick and fast – matched, ofcourse, by the cheques coming the other way. As he drove home with what appearedto be a music tape playing in the car, Rabbi Kaye told us that they were notallowed to listen to music, except at weddings. I guess anything by Meatloafwould definitely be out anyway, unless he had been inspected. So was the rabbibreaking the law as the music played in his car? Oh no, all sorted. Seeget-out-clause No 766, 859, 494. His tape was not music, it was purely vocal, hesaid. You got the impression that even he didn’t buy that one.Animals are only kosher if they have split hooves and chew the cud. Onedocumentary took us to a farm where they were making kosher and non-kosher milk.A farmworker said there wasn’t much difference in the process, really, but Iguess the farm still had to put the cheque in the post. Listening to the farm’skosher-inspector from Beth Din, it seemed like easy money to me. I quote himword for word in case you think I am making this up:> ‘I would be here quite a lot during the milking to ensure that there are no> other animals in the herd other than cows.’ Other animals such as?> ‘A buffalo.’ After a slight pause for reflection on how daft his answer was, he went on:> ‘… We do know there are no other animals in the herd, it’s very unusual to> have a mixed herd anyhow, but all the same the requirements are that we are> here. That is what makes the milk kosher, the very fact we are here checking,> although there is no real difference in the milk.’ Could you file that one with the insect loophole, please? Thanks so much, thefile’s marked ‘Bewildered’. Rabbi Furst stood beside a pile of dough, the breadkind. He said it contained a piece of every dough made at the bakery in the last36 hours and he was going to perform a special blessing to separate somethingfrom the dough in line with the Commandments. I never did understand exactlywhat he was separating and even after playing back the video I couldn’t work itout. Perhaps that was a good thing. He said some Hebrew words as he piled bitsof dough on top of each other and announced that he had designated this as‘Halla’ or Sabbath bread. The term Halla, a Jewish website told me, is ‘a nameused in ancient times to designate the priest’s share of the dough’. I know, Ithought the same. Rabbi Furst said that his words had made all the difference.‘Now it has a special level of holiness and I have to dispose of it in arespectable way.’ Dispose of it? If it was that holy why bin it, respectfully orotherwise? The rabbi had the answer. If they had a temple this dough would go tothe priests, he said, but as they hadn’t it would be thrown in the trash. Well,not directly because it would be disrespectful and against the law to do that.Instead, he explained, he put it in a plastic bag and then put that in anotherone. Wow, deep respect. ‘The fact that we have doubled-bagged it is consideredto be a respectful way of disposing of it’, he said. The rabbi told us that hehad no choice but to dump the dough because no one except the priests wasallowed to eat it. All other Jews were ‘not in a state of spiritual purity’. Whosaid so? The priests, I suppose. Once the rabbi had said his words to make theleftovers holy, he said that all the rest of the dough, from which the holy pilecame, was considered not holy and ordinary Jews could eat it. Are you stillthere, you’ve gone quiet?Rabbi Furst was filmed cracking what seemed to be an endless line of eggs to seeif they had any blood spots in them. The reporter asked him to explain what hewas doing and the rabbi said the law on this was complicated. I instinctivelytrembled at what might be to come after my experience with the severed insect,buffalo man, and the holy dough deal. He said the Torah ordered implicitly thata Jewish person shouldn’t eat blood from an animal. Simple enough, but not forlong. There was the question of what kind of blood was in an egg and if it wasblood they needed to worry about or not. Orthodox Jews, like the obsessiveadvocates of all the major religions, seem to do a lot of worrying, but thenthat’s the idea. He concluded, for reasons that escaped me, that blood in eggswas not the type that was so important to avoid but, nevertheless, he wouldstill check every egg to get rid of it. Rabbi Furst said that they spent a lotof time saying, ‘what if’? What if this happened, what if that happened? By nowyou had no trouble believing him. I’ll let him speak for himself about thetheological minefield that is a Cheese Danish:> ‘Now they make a little Danish and they put a dollop of cheese in the middle.> Sometimes the cheese will overflow the edges. If that Danish happened to be at> the end of the sheet and the cheese spread out and over the edge of the tray> it would fall onto the floor of the oven; and it would give it a dairy> quality; and if they then put a loaf of bread in there right away that bread> would have a dairy quality. > ‘So, I have gone to great lengths to convince the bakers to bake their Cheese> Danish in trays that have edges on all four sides so they won’t have this> possibility of “what if the cheese goes over the edge?”‘ By now I wondered if it was me or the rabbi who would be joining the cheesefirst. I am sure that thousands of years ago, sometimes even today, there werehealth reasons for some of these dietary habits, but the obsession with them andthe life-controlling strictness of them is off the wall, Wailing and ever other.There are also the hypocritical expressions of the Jewish laws like the one thatbans the drinking of wine that is not made by Jews. AskMoses.com[http://AskMoses.com] says that wine is only kosher if it has not been ‘handledby a non-Jew before the bottle is sealed …’. I wonder why that isn’t consideredracist when it would be if anyone else did the same? Personally, I don’t carewhat anyone freely chooses to eat and drink, it’s none of my business, but I amsick of this we-can-do-it-but-you-can’t arrogance that pervades such matters.The God Program is full of this hypocrisy. Rabbi Dayan Berger (there seemed tobe a lot of them) explained that the wine law was there to ‘put obstacles anddifficulties in the way’ to discourage the misuse of wine. How it made anydifference to get pissed on wine made by Jews or wine made by non-Jews was nevermade clear and I wondered if they weren’t making up much of this as they wentalong. It is a common trait with the ‘interpreters’ of religious law – ‘I thinkwhat God meant to say …’. The rabbi said the Jews-only wine thing went back along time to when idol worshipping was prevalent (what ten minutes ago?) and‘people came across a bit of wine, they somehow tried to turn it into an act ofworship …’. I do know the feeling. Rabbi Furst said the ovens in kosher bakeriescan only be turned on by a Jew and only brought up to temperature by a Jew.‘That makes the bread a more spiritual product’, he said. If a ChristianCaucasian said that he would be called a ‘White Supremacist’. What’s thedifference?Another programme in the Jewish Law series focused on the laws of the Sabbathevery Saturday, and the Passover, the biggest Jewish festival of the year, thatcommemorates the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. During the eight days ofPassover they are not allowed to eat anything that rises (okay, okay, enough)like leavened bread or anything that has been fermented. Rabbi Dovid Jaffe toldus that this was because the Jews left Egypt in such a hurry that the bread theyhad made didn’t have time to rise. During Passover they eat flat bread instead.Not only is leavened bread forbidden, all traces of it have to be purged fromthe house. Rifka Domnitz said from her kitchen: ‘The whole house is cleaned outbecause we’re looking for leaven, anything that might be bread, cakes, any sortof crumbs; also we don’t have whisky, vinegar, anything that’s fermented, [like]beer. So the whole house has to be scrubbed.’ I’m not sure about the ‘has to’.There is no ‘has to’ unless the will is conceded to insane religious ‘law’.In another house a ‘special Passover cooker’ was hauled from the back shed andit replaces the other one for eight days a year. I must say the two lookedremarkably similar. Even a microwave was covered in tin foil to thwart anylingering bread crumbs that might be poised to condemn the occupants to thefires of Hell. The lady of the house told us that no matter how clean she mayget the microwave there might still be something there. ‘If I put a hot pot ofchicken soup under [the microwave] the steam might dislodge crumbs or leaveninto the pot.’ That was a close one then. They were ‘very, very stringent abouteverything’, the lady said, and you needed no convincing. By way of confirmationwe cut to a woman using a paint-stripper flame-thrower to make sure there wasabsolutely no leaven on the sink and draining board. If only people were equallyobsessed with making sure no one went without food, warmth, shelter and theopportunity to live their dreams. But I suppose God is too busy panicking overthe deadly perils of a Cheese Danish to concern himself with such irrelevance.It was pointed out that the women do all the work while the men ‘set thereligious tone’. As one woman said of her husband: ‘He sets the spiritual toneand I do it the way he wants. Left to my own devices, I don’t know what I’d do.I have no idea.’ Sadly most people have no idea what they would do either ifleft to their own devices because they’ve never tried it.The best bit was when Rabbi Avraham Jaffe told us that all rabbis had sent formsto their congregation asking that they appoint their rabbi to sell all theirforbidden products to a non-Jew for the duration of Passover. The non-Jew payshis money and all the stuff belongs to him. There is, however, a clause in hiscontract that says that if he wants to sell it all back after Passover becausehe can’t make a profit on it, then that will be okay. They will ‘kindly’ let himoff and the deal will be null and void. Nothing moves; it’s just a papertransaction. The non-Jew is the official owner of all that Passover forbidsthroughout his local Jewish community, but he sells it back for the same pricewhen the festival is over. The buyer in the film, Colin Day, said he had beendoing this for 30 years. He said of Passover: ‘Virtually in that time, I’m amillionaire’. But, although he bought all the booty for a few pounds, he sellsit back after eight days because he ‘can’t make a profit’. How ridiculous it allis, and what a sham. Does God not know He is being conned here? Do they think‘He’ is that stupid?At least Passover is only once a year; the Sabbath, or Shabbat, is every week.We saw a family rushing around and panicking as the Sabbath loomed at sunset onthe Friday evening (although there is argument over whether this is what ‘God’meant). Rochel Jaffe said she had to have the oven going the whole time becauseyou can’t cook on the Sabbath. Who says? Whoever wrote the texts of the OldTestament thousands of years ago and no one knows that. ‘Once it starts gettingclose to the Sabbath it’s music off, video off, computer off, everybody getsdressed and gets out and they know they have to move quick, you know’, said MrsJaffe. She consulted the ‘when it’s the Sabbath’ chart behind a cupboard door.‘3.53, Sabbath is 4.31 … 31 and 7 is 38 minutes, 38 minutes, it should be okay.’Let’s hope so or goodness knows what God will do. Still cooking when the sungoes down on a Friday? Condemn her! As soon as Sabbath starts the father andboys must head for the synagogue while the wife and girls say prayers at home.Rabbi Brodie said that turning on a light, answering a phone or turning on akettle is banned once Sabbath has begun. Rabbi Kaye returned at this stage. I’dmissed him. He told us there are ‘so many dos and so many don’ts … can’t put alight on [during] the Sabbath, mustn’t make a fire … Sabbath we are not allowedto burn a fire … [so we] … can’t drive a car because you are burningcombustion’. As you’d expect with Rabbi Kaye, we were soon into serious detail:> ‘You should not burn a fire, but if a fire’s burning … I can let it continue> burning. If you came to my house on a Saturday and saw me sitting in the dark> and thought, “Ah, the lights are off here, okay, I don’t like you sitting in> the dark,” put the light on and walk out, I would have to leave the room> because I am benefiting from something done for me on the Sabbath. > ‘But if I say, “John, let’s have a drink, only problem is the room’s a bit> dark,” and you say “Oh, I’ll put the light on,” and you sit down, the light’s> been put on for you. And when you leave the room, I say, “John, do me a favour> don’t turn it off”, that’s fine.’ Whenever I need a way around the system, Rabbi Kaye is my man. As he pointedout: ‘Turning off something is slightly different to turning something on’. Youget the feeling that if the word ‘no’ did not exist in the orthodox Jewishvocabulary they would all be permanently speechless. Mind, it’s the same withall religions in the God Program and don’t start me off about the SouthernBaptists. One of the most bizarre of the Judaistic rituals is during thecompulsory eight days of mourning that orthodox Jewish people must go throughwhen a relative dies. They have to sit on a special low chair (reason neverexplained) and all mirrors must be covered (ditto). One poor guy was visited byRabbi Jaffe after the death of his sister to have his cardigan hacked at with aknife. This comes from the story of how Jacob reacted to the death of Joseph bytearing at his clothes. So, thousands of years later, Rabbi Jaffe pulled out hisblade and cut a hole in this man’s jumper while exchanging ‘holy words’. This issupposed to happen whenever a relative dies, much to the delight of clothingmanufacturers. I must say also that whenever these guys said their ‘holyprayers’ there seemed to be a surprising lack of feeling and the words ‘parrot’and ‘fashion’ came to mind. It was like hearing someone recite theirtwo-times-table. The only ritual that looked like fun was called Purim, orPour-in as it seemed to be. This is when Jews are told to relax and it is amitzvah from God that the men must get pissed. It is what you might call a barmitzvah. It was the only time in the series when the participants did not seemrushed and breathless, panicking to fulfil the next law in the daily timetable.After all that had gone before it was nice to see them relaxed and happy, albeitnot for long.An important part of the God Program software is to force or pressure childrento follow the parents’ beliefs. An orthodox Jewish mother said she had friendswho were worried sick that she had a daughter of 20 who wasn’t yet married orbetrothed. She said she wasn’t worried herself (you got the feeling she was)because God would find her daughter the right man. But even so she would make afew inquiries within the Jewish community. ‘We’ll find someone’, she said. We’llfind someone? For me, it is nothing sort of abuse to manipulate or even, in manycases, insist that your son or daughter marry someone who meets the approval ofyourself and/or the laws of your religion. This happens in a number of culturesand it’s a bloody disgrace. The same mother told us that God doesn’t like anyonewho is full of themselves and the ego must be purged. They had to ‘get rid ofarrogance and haughtiness’, she said. How this squared with pressurisingchildren to get married and forcing them to follow your religion was neverexplained.Behind all this apparent nonsense I have been describing in this chapter iscontrol – control by fear. Rabbi ‘Cheese Danish’ Furst summed it up as hecontinued with his ‘What if?’ theme:> ‘We apply this kind of thinking to everything we do – what if this can happen,> what if that can happen because we are afraid. We are afraid of the spiritual> damage that may come to us.’ (My emphasis) He said food could affect a person’s soul. If they ate food that had been madein the kosher way it had a positive spiritual affect on the soul – ‘and Godforbid if he should eat things that have been made in a way that violate strictkosher laws, it can have a negative effect on the soul’. One of the kosherslaughterers who bleeds animals to death made the same claims: ‘If a person eatsnon-kosher food it reduces his spirituality; if he sticks with kosher food itleaves his spirituality intact and in fact it grows because of the disciplinebehind having only kosher products. We believe this whole package of laws, asfar as eating is concerned, elevates … the soul to a higher spiritual level.’Utter bilge water. It certainly seems to do nothing for their health. Not one ofthese guys looked healthy. All this imposed behaviour is about the cosh not thekosher. It is to maintain a state of daily fear and servitude about theconsequences of not doing as you are told. It is the God Program. As Rabbi Furstsaid:> ‘We have got to understand that in the world to come we are going to have to> deal with this score card that we have developed over our life and … the> mistakes that we made we get punishment for them. However … if we fix up the> mistakes we made in this world then we don’t have to deal with it in the world> to come.’ What will the punishment be for mixing cheese with meat, one wonders? Theeternal damnation of eating at McDonald’s maybe. The game is simple. Getyourself a long list of laws you say were given by God, appoint a mafiapriesthood to ‘interpret’ what God meant, and frighten the followers shitless bytelling them what will happen if they break God’s law. It’s a cinch. I felt sosad for these guys in the Jewish Law series and those whom they themselvescontrol through fear. Rabbi Furst seemed a nice, jolly man to me, but there hewas living every day in fear of the consequences of breaching laws written bywho knows who thousands of years ago. The Matrix has him by the Cheese Danish.Where is consciousness in all this? Where is Infinite Possibility? The Do NotAsk (DNA) religions, which you are told to follow without question, are softwareprograms and what I have just described is one of the more blatant examples. Butthere are many others. Christians are similarly told, or pressured, what tothink, do and say. Through the imposition of monumental tosh, the Roman Churchhas held billions in the grip of terror – control – throughout its sorryexistence. What a disgrace it is, this ‘church’ of hate and fear that claimsmerchandising rights to a ‘loving God’. Then there are the sick minds at thelunatic extreme of the Muslim faith in countries like Iran where, as AmnestyInternational has reported, even mentally ill teenaged girls face being flogged,stoned to death or hanged for adultery, having sex before marriage and ‘actscontrary to chastity’. This applies, it seems, even if these kids are forcedinto prostitution by their parents. The coldness and viciousness of thesefanatics comes from the fact that they are software programs devoid ofconsciousness under this book’s definition. There are also the Mormons,Jehovah’s Witnesses, Muslims, and the grotesque caste system of the Hindus thatselects a child’s life opportunities by the family it is born into. These aredifferent names for the same basic mindset and the very fact they can give aname for what they believe means they have divided Oneness in their reality. Ifyou can put a name to what you are or believe, the Matrix has you because namesmeasure division not wholeness.These religions and so many more have one key thing in common: they are allbollocks. For readers from outside the United Kingdom, the British slang word‘bollocks’ means both testicles and utter nonsense, as in ‘a load of bollocks’.In the context of religions I use the word in both definitions. Like I say,which religion you choose is not important to the Matrix, so long as you fall inline with one of them because then the blinkers are on and the Matrix has you.What makes me smile is that they all think they are following a unique faithwhen they all come from the same blueprint, and they all have a need to wearuniforms. If you saw an orthodox Jew wouldn’t you know immediately with thebeard, black hat and long black coat? Would you not know a Muslim immediately,or Sikh, or Buddhist, or Christian priest? It’s the herd mentality mademanifest. Another hook in the God Program is obedience to the founders of thefaith. To Christians it’s Jesus; to Jews it’s Abraham or Moses; to Muslims it’sMohammed; to Sikhs it’s Guru Nanak; to Buddhists it’s Buddha; and to Hindus it’sKrishna. I wonder if he was a Hairy Krishna? No, that would make him a Sikh. Ican’t keep up with all this.I think I will start a new religion called Bollockism. I shall be the guru knownas the Bollock (unlike with human males there cannot be two Bollocks) and myfollowers shall be known as Bollockists. We shall be distinct from all otherreligions in that we will shave the hair from our testicles, and keep it in aplastic bag stuck to our chins. I shall create a women’s version in whichvaginal hair shall be considered sacred and must be worn under a turban. As youcan imagine, it will be a celibate faith.The greatest movie about religion yet made was Monty Python’s Life of Brian. Itexposed it all for the bollocks that it is and I recall the scene where Brian(symbol of Jesus) was running away from his followers and lost a sandal. One ofthe followers picked it up and shouted, ‘It’s a sign, it’s a sign’. They thenall took off a shoe in reverence to their master. What made the movie so funnywas that it was true. Religion is one of those flytraps of the spirit in which,as with the Matrix itself, you can often only see the nonsense of it when youare looking from the outside. I have met many former Christians over the yearswho have wondered why they couldn’t see how crazy it all was when it laterbecame so obvious to them. But then indoctrination and repetition are verypowerful when your consciousness is on vacation and letting the DNA program mindthe shop. In the United States, Christian believers also dominate the conspiracyresearch field and this is why they only go so far in what they say, but nomore. They are fine while their research supports their religious beliefs, butthey won’t cross the line, or even consider information, that would take theminto levels of understanding that undermine the validity of their faith. Theythink they are free from the manipulation because they know about the five-senseconspiracy, but the Matrix still has them through their religion and theirbelief in ‘God Bless America’.One of the reasons that religions survive despite their nonsense is a majormanipulator of human reality that I call assumptions. I watched a documentary inwhich Christian academics had to admit that they had little idea who wasresponsible for writing the Bible. They conceded that the contradictory Gospelswere certainly not written by eyewitnesses to the events they claim to describeand even the earlier Biblical texts were rewritten by the Church to fit thepolitical agenda of the time. But despite this demolition of what Christians areled to believe is the ‘word of God’, the academics said this had not dentedtheir faith. One said the ‘holy spirit’ must have been working through those whowrote and rewrote the Bible, even though they made contradictory statements(maybe ‘God’ was confused). The reason for this self-delusion was the assumptionthat Jesus must have existed and that the foundations of the story must be true.This assumption holds the belief together no matter what revelations may exposethe religious deceit. Despite all the provable lies and contradictions in theofficial version of 9/11, most people assume that the basic story must becorrect and, therefore, they will never grasp what really happened. Assumptionsedit reality because they are beliefs. As the Nazis used to say, the bigger thelie the more it will be believed – assumed to be true. Albert Einstein made somebelief-shattering scientific discoveries, but he was, himself, imprisoned bybelief. He was one who proposed the quantum theory but, once he realised theimplications of this breakthrough for his assumptions about God, he spent therest of his life trying (in vain) to disprove the findings of quantum physics.The perception of me among those programmed by media reports is constantlyedited by preconceived assumption. The media has portrayed me as crazy and thosewho believe such ‘reports’ filter whatever I say through that belief withouthearing what is actually being said. Wiping the hard drive clean of allprogrammed assumptions is essential because 99.9 per cent (at least) turn out tobe flawed.The Bible, when portrayed as the actual word of God, is the most destructivebook on earth. The literal rather than symbolic interpretation, no matter howcontradictory, leaves no room for independent thought or reappraisal in thelight of new understanding. It is a sheep pen for the mind. There is noquestion, no discussion, no debate. The religion dictates what is and what isn’tand that’s all you need to know. The sight of soldiers praying to God and askingJesus for support before battles of mass murder in Iraq reveals a level ofcontradiction, self-delusion and childlike naivety that beggars belief. I alsocringe when I see sports people crossing their chests and asking Jesus to helpthem win. What has he got against their opposition then? An England rugbycaptain said when appointed that he had always believed this was what the Lordhad planned for him. I am sure Jesus thought of nothing else. ‘Say, Dad, we needa new England rugby captain, but leave it to me, I’ve got just the bloke.’ AndGod saw that it was good.The depth of programming is such that even when faced with the illusory natureof reality the God Program can still prevail. I read an article on the Internetby a guy described as an ‘intelligent Christian’. I beg to differ if it’s allthe same with you. He had experienced reality-altering drugs and saw that the‘solid’ world is illusion. Ah, but there’s a catch. God wants us to believe theillusion is real, he said. I quote: ‘… the “perception” is exactly what Godwants us to see and any attempt to get beyond this perception is sorcery’. Thisart was explicitly forbidden in the Bible again and again, he tells us. Quantumphysics is sorcery, it seems, and part of Satan’s plan to enslave us. Plan? Youmean that what we have now is freedom? The spirit world was just as real as thephysical and was accessible through various methods, this Christian chapcontinued, but to do so was unethical. ‘The problem is, as usual, fallen man ispursuing knowledge on his own terms and, while gaining accurate data, is notsubjecting the findings to God’s law word.’ He said the Bible confirmed that Goddid not want us to know the world is an illusion because it never mentions thefact. By this time I would have given anything for a conversation with RabbiFurst about the dangers of molten cheese. Let me cut to this guy’s chase:> ‘Everyone DOES know that God exists and that He is in charge. All unsaved> humanity does seek to be free of what they see as his “tyranny”. We are at a> threshold in history. Never before have the techniques of “breaking free” –> the techniques of sorcery, been so close to being presented to the general> public. And the presentation is such that it bypasses all “religious”> terminology.’ Only to a victim of the God Program could breaking free be condemned as the workof the Devil. It is sobering to realise that no matter how much knowledge is putin front of people some are so utterly caught that they will go to any lengthsto make it fit their religious belief.The Matrix created the ‘gods’ of the religions and in fact there is only oneMatrix ‘God’ worshipped in different ways by the different versions of theprogram (Figure 64, overleaf). The Red Dress bloodlines were once again used tofound the religions and fast asleep consciousness has been trapped in the web.The Illuminati families have played a predominant role in the creation of themajor theological and fiscal religions, everything from Christianity and Judaismto the New Age and the worship of money.I outlined earlier, and have detailed at length in other books, how theIlluminati were heavily centred in ancient Babylon and then relocated to Rome.This is why the Roman Church, which became the foundation of Christianity in allits later forms, is the Church of Babylon under another name. You will find that‘Christian’ holy days are the holy days of Babylon and the ‘Christian’ trinityis the Babylonian trinity in disguise. Nimrod (the fish), his son, Tammuz (whodied to save humanity), and his ‘mother’, Queen Semiramis (the dove), weretransformed into Christianity’s Father, Son and Holy Ghost. The Babyloniansymbolism has been continued both in the religions they founded and the symbolsand architecture of our cities. Nimrod was also symbolised in Babylon as theFish God, Oannes, and in Figures 65 and 66 you can see the ancient depiction ofOannes/Nimrod alongside the Pope with the mitre on his head. Notice anysimilarities?? Roman Catholicism venerates Mary, the virgin ‘Mother of Jesus’and ‘Queen of Heaven’, in the same way that the Babylonians did with Semiramis,the virgin ‘Mother of Tammuz’, and ‘Queen of Heaven’, and the Egyptians did withIsis, the virgin ‘Mother of Horus’ and ‘Queen of Heaven’(Figures 67, 68 and 69,overleaf). Semiramis was said to have been ‘immaculately conceived’ by ‘God’ –the rays of the Sun God, Nimrod, also known as Baal.image [../Images/00069.jpg]Figure 64: Religions worship the same Matrix ‘God’ through different versions ofthe programimage [../Images/00070.jpg]image [../Images/00071.jpg]Figures 65 and 66: The fish god Oannes (Nimrod) as symbolised in Babylon; andthe mitre-headed Pope of the Roman Church. Do you think by any chance they couldbe connected??The ‘virgin-born sons’, Jesus and Horus, were both connected to the symbol ofthe fish, as was Nimrod. The Gospel stories, on which ‘Jesus’ and Christianitywere founded, are a mass of Egyptian/Sumerian/Babylonian mystery schoolsymbolism relating to sun worship, secret rituals and other esoteric concepts,as I detail in The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix. The same basicstory of ‘born on December 25th, died to save humanity, etc., was widely toldthousands of years before Christianity about the exploits of the sun gods inmany and various cultures, including Rome (Mithra) and Babylon (Tammuz – the‘son of the Sun God’). The halos used in pictures of the Gospel heroes areinspired by the way the ancients portrayed their sun gods with halos tosymbolise what they represented – the sun.The myth of Jesus has been a constant source of conflict, death and destruction,and we have seen this yet again with the Mel Gibson movie, The Passion ofChrist, the horrific violence of which must have had sadomasochists havingorgasms in their seats. First the Illuminati Anti-Defamation League (whichspends it’s time defaming people) said the movie was ‘anti-Semitic’, but fromwhat I see there is very little in the ADL’s juvenile mind that is notconsidered so. Next we had the New Black Panther Party in America condemning thefilm for portraying Jesus as white when they said he must have been black. TheADL said the movie was racist for blaming Jews for the death of Jesus and theNew Black Panthers said it was racist for misrepresenting the way he must havelooked. Over here a second guys, get this: there was no Jesus – black, white orpink with blue stripes! You are all arguing over someone who didn’t exist. TheJesus myth was sold to the black slaves by their captors as a means of controland now we have the pathetic sight of the so-called most powerful country in theworld dominated by a belief in a religion based on the worship of a non-existentman. Unless a would-be president professes a deep belief in this myth he has nochance of being elected to office. I can hear the Matrix laughing from here.image [../Images/00072.jpg]image [../Images/00073.jpg]image [../Images/00074.jpg]Figures: 67, 68, and 69: Three of a kind: the Christian Mother Mary and Jesus;the Egyptian Isis and Horus; and the Babylonian Queen Semiramis and Tammuz. It’sthe same myth under (barely) different guisesIn Babylon, Queen Semiramis proclaimed that Nimrod/Baal would be present onearth in the form of a flame, and that is the origin of the Illuminati symbol ofthe flame or lighted torch held by the Statue of Liberty – a portrayal of QueenSemiramis given to New York by French Freemasons in Paris, where they have amirror version on an island in the River Seine (Figures 70, 71 and 72). QueenSemiramis also became the British goddess deity, Britannia (Figure 73). WhenTammuz died, Semiramis said that he had ‘ascended to his father’, the sun orBaal, and would also be worshipped as a flame. The ‘Christian’ festival ofEaster comes from the same source. Easter originates from the Babyloniangoddess, Ishtar, (Semiramis again) and it celebrated her son, Tammuz, who wasthe ‘only begotten son of the Moon Goddess and Sun God’ – Nimrod and Semiramis.The ‘Easter’ (Ishtar) eggs and the ‘Easter bunny’ also come from Babylon. QueenSemiramis said she came from the moon in a giant egg and this became known asthe Ishtar egg. Tammuz was said to be very fond of rabbits and so we have theEaster bunny. They also ate ‘sacred cakes’ with a ‘T’ on the top – the origin ofour hot cross buns. The ‘T’ is a major symbol of Freemasonry partly because ofits associations with Babylon and Tammuz. The Christian wafer used in Catholicceremonies comes from the Egyptian ta-en-aah, the sacrificial bread of the moon.Christians think the bread symbolises the ‘body of Jesus’ when they are reallyinvolved in a ritual about an Egyptian moon deity!image [../Images/00075.jpg]image [../Images/00076.jpg]image [../Images/00077.jpg]image [../Images/00078.jpg]Figures 70, 71, 72 and 73: Queen Semiramis as depicted on an ancient coin andthe Statues of Liberty in New York and Paris. They are the same deity, as is theBritish Britannia. Note also how the Babylonian Semiramis is holding the‘Christian’ cross thousands of years before ChristianityJudaism in its Biblical form was also fundamentally influenced by Babylon. In587BC, the Babylonian army of King Nebuchadnezzar overran Judea and took most,though not all, of the people into captivity in Babylon. This was a melting potof peoples and bloodlines, and a centre for what we would call satanic ritualand black magic. The Judeans were captive in the sense that they couldn’t leave,but they were allowed to go about their business and came into contact with thereligious stories and myths from Babylon and the earlier Sumer in the land alsoknown as Chaldea, Mesopotamia and today, Iraq. It was after the 70-yearcaptivity that the Levite priesthood and others mixed ancient writings with theBabylonian influences to produce the Torah (the law) – the first five books ofthe Old Testament also known as the Pentateuch, which are officially attributedto ‘Moses’. This was hundreds of years after the events were supposed to havetaken place. Babylon was also the inspiration for the rabbinic teachings knownas the Babylonian Talmud, a massive influence on Jewish belief and deeplyracist. Whenever they wanted the people to do something they wrote that ‘God’had commanded it and thousands of years later orthodox Jewish people are stillagonising over their Cheese Danish and hacking at their beards with bluntscissors to make sure they conform.The Levites and company took Sumerian and Babylonian stories and transferredthem to their own, often made-up, characters. One was the tale of how theMesopotamian King Sargon was found as a baby floating in bulrushes on the RiverEuphrates by ‘Akki the irrigator’ and he was brought up to serve as gardener inthe palace of Kish. The story went that the goddess Ishtar favoured Sargon andhe eventually became king and emperor. The Levites and their cohorts changedSargon to Moses in their version of the same basic story. They also introducedthe character of St Michael, the Sumerian Tas Mi-ki-gal, the dragon-slayer andLord of Agriculture. He was later called Lord of the Air and given wings to fly.There were no angels in Israelite belief until the Babylon captivity. The GreatFlood of ‘Noah’ was also a steal from the far older Sumerian/Babylonian accountof Gilgamesh. As with Christianity, Babylonian holy days were turned into‘Jewish’ holy days. The Levites relocated Sumerian, Babylonian and Egyptianstories and themes to the land they called Israel. The high initiates havealways understood the coded meanings, but the mass of the people have been solda lie, a cover story, to imprison their minds and make them slaves to theirhierarchy. Even circumcision, so fundamentally associated with the Jewish faith,came from Egypt. You can see the common Babylonian origin for the Jewish andChristian religions in the beliefs and methods of Judaism and the Roman CatholicChurch. Both terrify their victims into conforming to ‘God’s law’ by the fear ofwhat will happen in the next world if they don’t obey the priests and the Biblein this one.I also see that some Sikh writers highlight the Old Testament story of Samson tosupport the belief that cutting your hair weakens you. But the myth of Samson isa symbolic story relating to sun worship, not follicle power. The ancientssymbolised the earth’s journey around the sun as the life cycle of a man. Hewould be born or reborn on what is our December 25th, three days after thewinter solstice when they said the sun had ‘died’ or reached the lowest point ofits power in the northern hemisphere. The ‘man’ would reach the peak of hisstrength at the summer solstice when he would be depicted with long golden hair,symbolising the powerful rays of the sun at that time of year. When he began togrow older and lose his strength as he entered the autumn, or fall (theastrological house of Virgo the Virgin, the ‘House of Delilah’), he would beportrayed with shorter hair reflecting the failing power of the rays. Samson isSam-sun, just as every syllable of Sol-om-on is a word meaning the sun. Jesuswas also a symbol of the sun and not the literal man of the Gospels. I expand onthis at length in other books and it is no coincidence that, according to theBible, it was three days after Jesus died that he was ‘resurrected’ – just asthey said about the sun between the winter solstice and what became our December25th.Islam also includes many elements of the Babylonian-inspired Christianity andJudaism in its belief system and accepts the literal existence of Jesus and the‘father of the Jews’, Abraham, whom it calls Ibrahim. Muslims believe thatAbraham/Ibrahim was a prophet carrying the same message from God as the laterMuhammad. Abraham is claimed to have erected the Ka’ba, the most holy place inthe Islamic world at Mecca. Most of the stories about Abraham in the Islamictradition come from sources other than the Koran and there are many parallels tothe life of Moses. Muslims also believe that Abraham circumcised himself at theage of 120 and that he died at the age of 175. On the day of resurrection theysay that Abraham will sit to the left of God and lead believers into Paradise.What we have here, and they are not alone, are religions created and designed toimprison consciousness in the Matrix by selling the same basic belief package:those that believe in the religion and do as it demands will have a one-wayticket to Paradise as the chosen ones of ‘God’. Jews claim to be the chosenpeople; Christians say that only by believing in Jesus will we go to heaven; andMuslims say that only those who follow the Allah version of ‘God’ will you booka seat on the cloud. It is the God Program – Matrix software for theimprisonment of human consciousness.Only the details appear different to give the illusion of religious choice andcreate the fault lines through which the desired conflict between beliefs can beorchestrated. What strikes me about religions is not their differences, most ofwhich are irrelevant detail, but their similarities. They are the same in theway they coerce and bully their followers; they overwhelmingly have the sameorigin; and even the uniforms are often similar. Jews, Muslims and the RomanCatholic Pope all wear the skullcap. If the Pope had a beard he would have theset. The priests of Babylon shaved their heads in a circle at the crown, knownas a tonsure, to signify their allegiance to the sun god and this was continuedby the Roman Catholic clergy because it was the Church of Babylon relocated.Some tribes in Africa and some South American Indians shave their heads in thesame way. The skullcap (called the kippa or kippah by Jews) is symbolic of thecommitment to the sun god – the religion of Babylon and Chaldea. AlexanderHislop writes in The Two Babylons (Chick Publications, reprint edition, 1998):> ‘Over all the world, where the traces of the Chaldean system are found, this> tonsure or shaving of the head, is always found along with it. The priests of> Osiris, the Egyptian Bacchus, were always distinguished by the shaving of> their heads. In Pagan Rome, in India, and even in China, the distinguishing> mark of the Babylonian priesthood was the shaven head. Thus Gautama Buddha,> who lived at least 540 years before Christ, when setting up the sect of> Buddhism in India which spread to the remotest regions of the East, first> shaved his own head, in obedience, as he pretended, to a Divine command, and> then set to work to get others to imitate his example.’ The Sikh and Hindu turban can be found in ancient Babylon and the westerntraditions that came from there. Ezekiel 23:15 in the Old Testament says that ‘…with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of themlooked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea’. Ezekiel 44:18orders that ‘they are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linenundergarments around their waists’. I didn’t realise how many times the turbangets a mention in the Bible, the book quoted by far more religions than Judaismand Christianity to support their beliefs and impositions. Major world religionsare the offspring of Babylon. The gods of religious extremism are a Matrixprogram designed to be the blinkers that block peripheral vision. What theMatrix needs for its vibratory illusions are polarities, the two points betweenwhich a frequency can resonate; so Left is as important as Right to the Matrixbecause one cannot exist without the other and Christianity is as important asJudaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism – any of them. You will also notice how theoriginal religion is divided into a mass of competing, often warring, factions.We have Protestant Christians and Roman Catholic Christians and the Protestantfaith is itself a mass of competing subgroups. Jewish beliefs present theimpression of being united when there are many different groupings incompetition. Islam has its Sunni and Shiite factions divided by conflict overthe so-called caliphs, the alleged successors to the Prophet Mohammed. Here isan explanation of this conflict. Please read slowly and concentrate:> ‘There are a number of differences in the Shi`ah (Shiite) and the Sunni> Juristic opinions. However, not all these differences can be termed as the> “basic differences” in these two major sects of Islam. The basic difference in> the two sects is that of the Shiite faith of the system of “Imamah”. The> Shiite faith of “Imamah” implies that after the Prophet (pbuh), there shall be> no other prophet but, the only true leader of the Muslims, at any given time,> is an “Imam” who, like the prophets of God, is directly appointed by God. The> appointment of the first “imam” was made by God through the last Prophet> (pbuh), while every subsequent “imam” is appointed through the “imam,” who> precedes him. Another qualification of the “imam,” according to the Shiite> belief is that he shall belong to the family of the last Prophet (pbuh). The> Shiite belief holds that the “Imams,” like the prophets of God, are “ma`soom”> (sinless, innocent) and, therefore, should be obeyed in all matters and under> all circumstances. The “Imams,” according to the Shiite faith, are thus not> just the political leaders of the Muslims but also their religious leaders and> clergy. The Sunni school, on the other hand, does not ascribe to any such> belief.’3 Okay, have you got that or do you need a bit longer? So that’s why they havespent so long fighting and killing each other. If children acted like thereligious fanatics you would tell them to grow up. What insanity it all is. Weare Infinite Consciousness so why do we need some priest, caliph or rabbi totell us what to think and how to live our lives? It is spellbindingly ridiculousand everyone suffers the consequences of these schoolboy squabbles with theglobal disharmony they create. But conflict and division is what the Matrixdesires and religions always deliver because so many of their advocates havelost the power of independent thought and discernment if, indeed, they ever hadit.If you are awake enough to reject conventional religion, the Matrix has otheroptions. You can worship the gods of money, ‘status’, and power over others.These obsessions are religions under other names and also dictate what you mustdo, think and say to achieve your goal. ‘I must be what the boss wants me to beso I can get the foreman’s job’; ‘I must do what the Prime Minister wants me todo so he will make me a lord’; ‘I must trample over people and ignore theconsequences of my actions for others so I can make as much money as possible’.These religions also have a uniform – the shirt and tie. What is it with that?They say people have to go to work ‘properly dressed’ in shirt and tie and evenschoolchildren often get the same treatment. Who decided that shirt and tie =properly dressed? It wasn’t me, was it you? No? Then who and why? I was watchingthe television news when Tony Blair was making a speech about Iraq dressed in ashirt, tie and suit. He handed over to the interim Prime Minister of Iraq, theCIA and British intelligence asset, Ayad Allawi, a ‘Muslim’ who was also wearinga shirt, tie and suit. They then cut to the political correspondent (shirt, tieand suit) who handed back to the newsreader (shirt, tie and suit). How was thecommunication of that ‘news’ made any more effective because everyone waswearing the same uniform? Were the horrors inflicted on Iraq by Bush and Blairmitigated and made less abhorrent because they made the order to invade whilewearing a shirt, tie and suit? Once again, it’s all nonsense.The shirt and tie has the same origin as all other religions and their uniforms,the ancient secret mystery schools in Babylon and elsewhere. It comes from aceremony still performed today by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (anotherBabylon religion) in which the initiate has a noose, known as the cable tow,placed around his neck while blindfolded or ‘hoodwinked’, as it is called, andhe is pulled along by the rope in the ritual. The tie, as in shirt and tie, is anoose. The initiates of the shirt and tie religions have a noose around theirnecks while being blindfolded by the Matrix, and how appropriate that the‘proper attire’ for the ‘professional classes’, and Christian men attendingchurch, is a shirt and tie. Even music comes with a uniform while claiming to bedifferent. If you saw a rap singer (back-to-front baseball cap) or punk rocker(designer-dishevelled) wouldn’t you know what they were before they played achord? The official religions and those that worship money, power and celebrityare essentially the same. Only the name of the god is different. For ChristiansHe’s the Almighty; for Jews He’s Yahweh; for Muslims He’s Allah; for the shirtand tie religions He’s status, title or bank balance; and for the celebrityreligions He is the latest hyped flavour of the moment. All are expressions ofthe God Program and all have the same aim: human control.There is one other point to make about religions in all their forms. Theyencourage or impose rigid beliefs and these stem the flow of energy through theDNA network and suppress (make correspondingly dense and rigid) the resonance ofthe human hologram. This locks people deeper into the low frequencies of theMatrix program. American psychiatrist, David Shainberg, from the William AlansonWhite Institute of Psychiatry in New York, believes that thoughts are vorticesthat can become fixed and rigid. He suggests that these manifest themselves asfixed opinions, unchanging views and a rigid sense of reality that is resistantto change. He is correct and this is reflected in the brain where fixed neuronconnections caused by rigid belief close down the central processing unit tohigher perception.When you fall for the God Program, the Matrix has you – big time.Sources > 1http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/05-Worship/section-42.html> [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/05-Worship/section-42.html]> 2http://www.ecademy.com/node.php?id=26320> [http://www.ecademy.com/node.php?id=26320])> 3http://www.understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=417> [http://www.understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=question&qid=417]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN Old Age, New Age – Same Story > To disagree with three-fourths of the British public is one of the first> requisites of sanity Oscar Wilde If you can see through the conventional religions and the pursuit ofmaterialism, the Matrix still has its backstop, the goalkeeper when every otherdefence has been breached. It is called the ‘New Age’.Ironically, the New Age, in all its forms, is significantly more enlightenedthan conventional religion and humanist thought. It understands that this worldis only one of infinite dimensions of existence and all is but a differentvibration within an infinite whole. It speaks of Oneness and knows that it ispossible to communicate between vibratory realms. I agree with the basic themeand there are many genuine and intelligent people who accept and articulate itsbeliefs. But what makes the New Age such an effective last line of defence forthe Matrix is the very fact that it is more aware than atheism and conventionalreligion. Those who expand their consciousness to see through the absurdity ofcurrent human existence and the mainstream explanations for ‘life’, are indanger of sussing the virtual-reality game they are caught in. The Matrix needsa trap to ensnare them before the final pennies drop and the New Age is it. Putanother way, it is the last cul-de-sac before the gold mine.A key control system is the way the New Age and Spiritualism portray thedivisions between this ‘physical’ realm and what they call the ‘spirit world’.Even most of those who accept the existence of the Matrix would perceive it tobe the reality we are now experiencing with the spirit world beyond it.Therefore, much of what is communicated through spiritualist mediums and New Age‘channels’ is considered more enlightened than our reality and thus to beencompassed, believed or acted upon. We might hear lines like ‘test thespirits’, but the conscious and subconscious themes are that the ‘other side’must know best. On one level this can have validity because they know by thevery fact they are communicating with this realm from another one that there aremany ‘worlds’ of existence. But while they may have that knowledge, theoverwhelming majority of these communicators are also caught in the Matrix. Itis a multi-dimensional system with different software programs for differentlevels of awareness. The Matrix is empowered by the energy generated byimprisoned consciousness, not only here, but in other dimensions of itself.I wrote earlier about the interspaces where the Reptilians, the manipulatingones, anyway, appear to reside and the New Age talks about the realms of deepmalevolence that it calls the lower astral. These realms are Matrix energygenerators, too, under the control of other software. The game may be a littledifferent, but the aim is the same. ‘Death’ in this world and the transition toanother level of the Matrix is like swapping Super Mario for the Sims on thesame computer or moving between strands in the same web. This is one fundamentalreason why we ‘forget’ where we’ve come from when we are born into the TimeLoop. We enter a different program and unplug from the last one. Only throughour Infinite Consciousness can we remember who we really are.Any realm in our current experience that takes form, vibrates or has rules, is aprogram of the Matrix. New Age thought describes the different bodies that wehave in different dimensions. We have a ‘physical’ body in this world, but inthe astral realms we have an astral body that resonates to the frequency of thatdimension and so on. I agree with this, but these different holographic bodiesrelate to different software programs within the Matrix and they are illusions.The program is delivered to us through the DNA receiver/transmitters and theseother ‘bodies’ within the Matrix have their version of DNA which, when you gobeyond the hologram, is a frequency field or waveform. Only when we become pureconsciousness in awareness of itself can we ditch the bodies and with them theMatrix. Communicators from these other realms of the virtual-reality game speakof living in a place that vibrates quicker than this world and so we cannot seeit from our density. Again, I have no problem with that. But the crucial wordthere is vibrates. As the voice in Brazil said: ‘If it vibrates, it’s illusion’.What I experienced in what I was told was a state of Oneness beyond the Matrixdid not vibrate. It was still or, at most, a slow-motion wave here and there.Everything just was and there were no rules. This is a critical point. If thereare rules, it’s the Matrix.The voice said, for example, that there were no laws of physics, only scientistsusing illusory ‘laws’ to measure an illusory universe. They were merely ‘laws’that we believed in. There were no laws of any kind because everything just was.‘Do you think the Infinite needs “laws” through which to express itself?’ thevoice asked. The ‘law’ of gravity, like all the others, is just part of thesoftware that can be overcome by consciousness that can disconnect itself fromthe program. This is what so-called miracles are – the ability to override theprogram and so override the illusory laws and limitations of the program. Rulesare the illusion of DNA mind, not the creation of Infinite Consciousness. Thisworld is drowning under rules because it is the densest part of the Matrix, butrules operate throughout the multidimensional system. Some scientists say thatthe different parallel universes they’ve identified have different laws ofphysics. But how can this be? Surely if the laws are real the same ones shouldapply everywhere? The reason they don’t is because the different ‘universes’ aredifferent software programs that operate with different manufactured rules.Communicators from other dimensions also tell of rules, like they can’t helpanyone in this world unless the person asks them. That’s a Matrix program.Outside the Matrix there are no rules. This point is well made by Morpheus inthis conversation with Neo (‘the One’) in the first Matrix movie:> ‘I’ve seen an agent [software program] punch through a concrete wall. Men have> emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and> their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules. Because of> that, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.’ > ‘What are you trying to tell me, that I can dodge bullets?’ > ‘No, Neo. I’m trying to tell you that when you’re ready, you won’t have to.’ The Matrix controls us because we play by its rules and the biggest mistake isto believe that there are any. It has been shown that the beliefs of thescientists performing an experiment will affect the outcome because beliefcreates reality and laws are only what we believe them to be. Remember, the‘world’ the scientists are exploring only exists in their heads, too. They areseeking to dissect and label an illusion while thinking it’s real! The DNAprogramming is selling us the reality of ‘laws’, but our consciousness is morethan powerful enough to overcome that. The New Age, as a Matrix phenomenon, isfull of rules, as are the Eastern philosophies on which it is based. You have todo this ritual or that ritual, speak to the spirits in a certain way, or protectyourself with a mantra. I have seen New Age advocates speak to the earth bylooking in turn to north, south, east and west. They have their sacred trees,swords, rods or staffs and their awe of these symbols matches anything you willfind in conventional religions. Yet all this is just more illusion. The earthhas consciousness, but its physical form is a software program; so is north,south, east and west, and the other planets and stars. Why are we in awe of acosmic Game Boy? It’s just a trap.I am not saying that everything the New Age proclaims is mistaken, not at all.But what it perceives to be outside of the system of control is not. Takeastrology, a major New Age tool. In the right hands, it can be extremelyaccurate and sometimes very useful in a ‘this world’ sense. The movement of theplanets and stars is a Matrix program, a holographic version of the oneprojected on the ceiling of a planetarium. These planetary movements triggervibrational changes that affect humans and other life on earth because itaffects the DNA and the input/output system. The point at which we enter theTime Loop also impacts the DNA. Astrology is the interaction between thevibrational fields created by the celestial cycles and our DNA program isaffected by where in the cycle we are ‘born’. But I stress that this interactionis not between our consciousness and the planetary movements; it is between theplanets and our DNA, which includes the mind and emotions. At this level,astrology in its deeper and detailed form is certainly relevant, but when wemove our awareness beyond mind to the consciousness of the ‘One’, we cease to beaffected by the astrological ‘laws’.What is referred to as ‘Fate’ is not the inevitable experience of consciousness;it is the inevitable outcome of the DNA computer program unless consciousnessintervenes. Fate is Matrix software. Oneness doesn’t do fate. There is no suchthing as a done deal within All Possibility. The voice in Brazil said thatastrology was another Matrix tool to enforce the illusion about the progressionof time and to encourage people to identify with their illusory ‘personality’ –I am a Taurus, Leo, Capricorn or whatever. It emphasised the division of parts,not the whole. ‘Do you think the Infinite has its astrology read?’ asked thevoice. ‘Do you think it consults a psychic about its “future” or visits a tarotcard reader?’ As I was hearing these words, I was shown a symbolic scene of theInfinite sitting at a table when someone brought the morning paper. The Infiniteturned to the list of birth signs on the astrology page and said: ‘Oh, mygoodness, this will take me all morning because I am all of them’. This doesn’tmean that gifted psychics and tarot card readers do not have a role to play,only that we need to understand that, with rare exceptions, they arecommunicating with entities and energies within the Matrix that are also caughtin illusory reality.The most profound delusion of New Age thought in my view is the idea that we are‘evolving’ though our experience. I can see how it looks that way, but this isthe spiritual version of the theory of evolution attributed quite wrongly toCharles Darwin (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). While the ‘Darwin’ theoryspeaks of the survival of the fittest and genetic change triggered by necessityover aeons, so the New Age believes in a cycle of repeating experience in thisworld called reincarnation, through which we spiritually evolve over thevastness of time. The idea is that we move between the physical earth and the‘spiritual’ realms experiencing every life possibility. In doing so, it is said,we learn and evolve spiritually to reach higher vibrations and eventually mergewith the One. But we are already Infinite Oneness and All Possibility. Why do weneed to evolve into something we already are? This belief is a crucial meansthrough which the Matrix maintains its grip on our reality, not only in the TimeLoop, but in its non-’physical’ levels too.We don’t have to evolve to enlightenment, we are enlightened; we have simplyforgotten because we are caught in the illusion. ‘Do you think the Infinite hasto reincarnate?’ the voice said to me. ‘Consciousness in the Matrix is also theInfinite, so why does that have to reincarnate?’ I hear people say they havelearned from experience and I understand that. But I would put it another way.The experience has not taught them anything, merely removed a layer of the veilso they can remember more easily what they already know. I have no problem withthe idea of reincarnation, although I think there is a lot more to understandabout it. I’m sure it’s correct that consciousness is caught in a cycle ofmoving between the other levels of the Matrix and different parts of thesoftware program or Time Loop DVD. It is not this that I challenge, but thebelief that it is necessary to find enlightenment.I would say the opposite is the case because reincarnation reinforces the ‘wemust evolve’ reality the Matrix seeks to pedal. This keeps consciousnessenslaved through the belief that it is getting somewhere. As the voice spoke inBrazil, I was shown a picture of people symbolically dropping from the sky ontoa footpath across a field. The voice said that because consciousness in theMatrix was caught in a cycle of moving in and out of the Time Loop throughreincarnation, people were not only conditioned by the beliefs of one ‘physical’lifetime – they were conditioned by endless experiences in the Time Loop(different parts of the DVD). Between these ‘physical’ excursions they were inanother form of illusory state. They were already conditioned even as theyentered the Time Loop reality for still more conditioning. This was why humansdropped into the conditioned, servile mentality so easily; they had been theremany times before. When these words were being spoken, I saw the footpath beingworn away by the trampling feet going over the same ground until the path lookedlike a sort of record groove. It got deeper and deeper and the figures walkingthe path went further and further down until they disappeared. ‘Is it any wonderthat humans look up for their God?’ the voice said. ‘It is the only place wherethey can see any light!’ Advocates of the reincarnation/karma cycle might alsoponder on how much ‘past-life’ memory is actually the program carried in the DNAand not the recall of incarnate consciousness.The point about continuing in an illusory state even after what we call death isextremely important, not least because these other levels provide the sourcesfor most (though not all) of the psychic and channelled information of the NewAge and Spiritualism. That is not to say that some of this is not worthwhile andvalid, but we need to understand that the communicators are in the Matrix too.These other realms could be even more open to illusion because they operate on ahigher vibration with far less density. Compared with the treacle-like densityof the Time Loop, it must indeed seem like Heaven. The voice in Brazil, and atother times since, described how other levels of the Matrix include a Christian‘heaven’, Islamic ‘heaven’, Hindu ‘heaven’ and Jewish ‘heaven’, etc. Theseweren’t ‘real’; they were the manifestation of belief in the same way that wecreate our reality in this world. They are software programs of the mind whichsell us that reality, but we don’t have to buy them.If Christians believe deeply that they will see Jesus when they ‘die’, then theywill. They will edit reality in line with the belief in that reality. What’smore they will see the version of Jesus that European artists invented becausethat has become their belief of what he looked like. I have met many psychicsover the years who have told of their experiences with Christians who have died,especially Roman Catholics, who are stuck in some in-between realm, maybe aninterspace, waiting to be judged by God because that is what they believed wouldhappen. The illusion doesn’t end at ‘death’ because the Matrix ismulti-levelled. I love the line ‘death is no cure for ignorance’, because it’sso spot on. At what we call death, ‘incarnate’ consciousness is drawn by theprinciple of sympathetic resonance to realms that vibrationally mirror its ownstate. Put simply: what you believe when you ‘leave’ decides where you ‘go’. Butwherever you ‘go’ within the Matrix, it’s still illusion.We need to break the cycle of programmed belief and open ourselves to InfiniteConsciousness. If people like Rabbi Furst believe in punishment in the nextworld for actions in this one, that is what their consciousness will create. Itain’t true, unless you believe it is. Psychics and channellers are constantlyconnecting with ‘dead people’ who talk of being in Heaven or of continuing theirspiritual evolution by having instruction at ‘Halls of Learning’ in their newdimension or world. I am not saying this isn’t true in their reality, only thatit is another Matrix program. It had them by the Cheese Danish and now it hasthem by the Halls of Learning. It is another version of the ‘we must evolvethrough experience’ scam. We are the One, all enlightened, all consciousness,all knowing, no schools necessary. New Age thought also believes that the earthis a spiritual ‘university’ where people learn tough lessons and work out their‘karma’. This was illusion, the voice in Brazil said. ‘Do you think the Infinitehas to go to school to learn anything when it knows everything there is toknow?’ As for karma, the idea that you experience what you have made othersexperience, the voice asked: ‘Why should the Infinite have to experience what ithas made itself experience?’ The idea of karma is a Matrix myth to confirm abelief in evolution over ‘time’ and encourage a state of guilt andself-loathing. ‘Infinite Love does not judge itself or loathe itself – these areillusions of disconnection’, the voice said. While I was pondering all this Ihad a picture in my mind of the Matrix as a snakes and ladders game.Consciousness thought it was progressing up the vibratory levels towards ‘God’,when at some point it would stand on a snake and come sliding down to begin allover again (Figure 74). The Matrix is a system that wants to entrap moreconsciousness, not free that which is already caught in the net.When you observe the New Age you see constant parallels with the conventionalreligions that it claims to reject. It talks a good story about the need toexpress your own power and not give it away to others, but it is, in blatantcontradiction, awash with hierarchy. There are endless ‘spiritual masters’ inthis world and others. As mainstream religions hand their minds to gods andpriests, so the New Age bows its head to masters, gurus and other-dimensionalcommunicators. There is the so-called ‘Great White Brotherhood’ and the fleetsof alleged UFOs headed by ‘Ashtar Command’ who communicate ‘enlightenment’ totheir advocates. This is just more tosh to fuck with our heads. The Great WhiteBrotherhood (also known as The White Lodge/The Brotherhood/The Brotherhood ofLight) is claimed to be a spiritual organisation composed of those ‘AscendedMasters’ who have ‘arisen from our earth into Immortality’. They could have goneto the ‘Cosmic Heights, leaving our brothers and sisters on earth behind’, butinstead they said they would ‘stay and assist’.1 It is said that they have‘transcended the cycles of karma and rebirth and ascended into that HigherReality which is the eternal abode of the soul’.This Brotherhood, I learn, has been ‘sponsoring the release of the spoken wordthrough conclaves, seminars, writings, books, and through personal discipleshipand training’. They are also releasing the ‘full teachings that theDispensations of Cosmic Law allow at the dawning of the Great Golden Age ofSaint Germain [a member of the Brotherhood]’. Here yer go. We must have our‘Cosmic Law’ because this is the Matrix. And why does this Saint Germain guyhave to copyright and trademark this golden period? Isn’t it supposed to be foreveryone? Isn’t the New Age about not conceding your power to others? But whenyou are caught in the Matrix you must have the obligatory hierarchy andpedestalled heroes. If there is a hierarchy, it’s the Matrix because suchstructures do not exist in Oneness. How can you have a hierarchy when there isonly One?image [../Images/00079.jpg]Figure 74: The New Age Matrix: consciousness caught in the illusion of evolvingthrough reincarnated experience is playing a sort of snakes and ladders game.

Even though this classic image of Jesus derives only from westernartists, both Christianity and the New Age manage to portray him the same wayThe Great White Brotherhood is claimed to be a ‘Spiritual Order of Hierarchy’,an organisation of Ascended Masters united for the highest purposes of God inman as set forth by … wait for it … ‘Jesus the Christ, Gautama Buddha and otherWorld Teachers’. The boy Jesus turns up everywhere. To the New Age he is knownas Sananda, an ‘Ascended Master with the Great White Brotherhood’. Funny how‘Sananda’ is depicted in the same way as the Christian Jesus (Figures 75 and 76)and yet this classic facial image comes only from the works of western artists.There is nothing in the Bible to suggest what Jesus looked like, not leastbecause the writers had no idea either! But, even so, the Christian and New Ageimages of ‘Jesus’ somehow come out the same. The Great White Brotherhood alsoincludes ‘Members of the Heavenly Host, the Spiritual Hierarchy directlyconcerned with the evolution of our world, Beneficent Members from other planetsthat are interested in our welfare, as well as certain unascended chelas’. What?How did those unascended chelas get in there? Did they get a wild card or didthey pearly gatecrash? What is a bloody chela anyway? Hold on, I’ll find out,won’t be long. Thank goodness for Google. It seems that a chela is a sort ofdisciple to a mahatma. I never would have thought. They apparently take part insomething called ‘chelaship’ and the Sanskrit word ‘chela’ is used, I see,because it has a more specific significance than the words ‘pupil’ or ‘disciple’as understood today. To be a chela ‘implies a peculiar degree of loyalty toone’s chosen teacher and to the principles underlying his teachings’.2 Well, onthat basis, this world is overrun by chelas, billions of them, all with apeculiar degree of loyalty to their chosen teacher and to the principlesunderlying the shite they are told to believe (see religion, politics,economics, medicine, law, military, ad infinitum).It would appear from what I read that Ashtar Command is the ‘airborne division’of the Great White Brotherhood. Why do the Ascended Masters, ‘who havetranscended the cycles of karma and rebirth and ascended into that HigherReality’, need a flippin’ air force? This whole UFO/extraterrestrial beliefsystem is another part of the Matrix program, just like the ‘human’ version. Iam not saying for a moment that there are not other body-types operatingelsewhere in the Time Loop and its associated realms that we call ETs. But theyare caught in the illusion, too, and they are just another subplot in theholographic movie. I saw an advertisement for ‘UFO invasion’ screensaversoftware – ‘a multi-functional screensaver incorporated with classic arcadecomputer games, images include UFOs, aliens, military aircrafts, and many morecharacters’. All this extraterrestrial/UFO stuff is a holographic version ofthat. I have seen it suggested that the ‘goblins’, ‘pixies’, ‘fairies’, and‘little people’ of folklore manifest today as what we call ETs. This could wellbe true because the Matrix will provide the software that compliments the partof the ‘DVD’ that is being experienced. At the point in the movie we call say1306, the ‘ETs’ might take a form that fits with that era, while in thecomputerised, so-called hi-tech world of the 21st century they take theappearance of sci-fi space beings. Or, in the case of Ashtar Command, they areonly a fairytale that their followers believe.I put Ashtar Command into Internet search and found more than 17,000 pagesincluding pictures of ‘him’ (Figures 77 and 78, overleaf). The belief is thatthis extraterrestrial cavalry is coming to save the day. It is the same programthat stars Jesus in the Christian version and the Messiah in the Jewish edition.We even have the same theme of the ‘chosen ones’ in that Ashtar followers havetold me how they are going to be taken from the planet, ‘turned into fifthdimensional beings’, and brought back to teach humanity. One website provided amessage from ‘Commander Starene of the 7th Fleet in the Ashtar Command’.Apparently her ship, the Rainbow Light, has been ‘called into our solar systemto aid in the balancing of the Harmonics for our Planet Earth!’ Hey, let’sparty. She was doing this from the Venusian system by sending love on pulsarwaves and working with the other ships in the command to ‘send the Harmonic Raysdirectly to the affected areas that are causing the disharmony!’ Sounds like acosmic haemorrhoid cream. All anal retentives should apply Harmonic Rays to theaffected areas. The ‘message’ was peppered with exclamation marks, a symbol ofthe naive overexcitement that you find in many areas of the New Age. CommanderStarene was working with the geometrics and all ships were planning strategiesto work with the leaders and countries to find solutions! I hope this includes asolution to the problem of people believing this trash. The ships were onstandby as always, the message continued, and were ready for any mishaps ifthere were ‘going to be any ascended beings leaving this planet!’ (See chosenones whipped off to the fifth dimension and all that stuff.) Commander Starenesaid that all was being looked after and watched over. ‘All members of thecommand are very busy doing their jobs as we are in spirit and in our spiritbodies or lightbodies!!!’ The message concluded:> Dear Beloved Ones, I, Starene, send you the Most Golden Rose LOVE vibrations> to each and every one of YOU! We are so glad that you are listening and> connecting with us! Be at PEACE within as without … Be at LOVE …!!! We ALL> LOVE YOU!!!!!! > Adonai!

Starene, 7th Fleet Ashtar Commandimage [../Images/00082.jpg]image [../Images/00083.jpg]Figures 77 and 78: Two of many New Age depictions of ‘Ashtar’It is the saviour–messiah theme in another guise, a different version of the GodProgram and, as with all of them, whenever it is predicted the saviour willcome, in this case Ashtar Command, there is always a reason why it has to bedelayed. I find it interesting that the major Illuminati goddess in Babylon,Queen ‘Statue of Liberty’ Semiramis, was also known as Ishtar or … Ashtar. Ithink we have another coincidence going here. They are taking the piss. You’dexpect Jesus to be involved somewhere and, of course, he is. Ashtar Command isan ‘etheric group of extraterrestrials, angels and lightbeings and millions of“starships” working as coordinators of the activities of the spacefleet over thewestern hemisphere’, all under the ‘spiritual guidance of Sananda (the MostRadiant One), the ascended master who walked the earth incarnated as Jesus theChrist’. You know the guy, also called Tammuz, Mithra and Dionysus, amongendless other aliases. One Ashtar website carried Christmas greetings fromMother Mary, another of the New Age–Christian crossovers in the God Program.Ashtar himself, the commander of the galactic fleet and representative for theUniversal Council of the Confederation of Planets is, I understand, currentlyengaged in earth’s ascension-process. I am most relieved. This is the deal:> ‘There are 144,000 light workers called Eagles connected to the Command and> that is the minimum of souls required for the ascension process. These Eagles> are a group of souls who don’t identify with a special planet.

Light work is incorporating Jesus’s> message of Love and Light into our daily lives, ultimately connecting with our> Higher Self.’3 A lady once told me that she was one of the 144,000 and I asked her how sheknew. She said she had attended a workshop in Glastonbury (a British version ofSedona, Arizona) and the host had told her the good news. The host had also hada vision of her as a goddess walking down stone steps in Atlantis. A few monthslater another woman mentioned that she was one of the 144,000. I asked her ifshe had been to a workshop in Glastonbury where the lady had a vision of herwalking down steps as a goddess in Atlantis. ‘How did you know?’ came the reply.I also read that Jesus (as Sananda) and Lady Nada (never did work out who shewas) both work with the ‘sixth ray’ to heal fanaticism and to raise the focus ofdevotional worship. And that’s the point, really. All these Matrix programsadvocate forms of ‘devotional worship’. But we are Oneness, so on whom are weprojecting such worship? The Matrix wants us to find something or someone tolook up to because it creates a mindset of me down here and ‘them’ up there.That’s not Oneness, it is division and hierarchy.The New Age talks of Oneness, but uses the language of polarity – the verysystem through which the world of vibration can manifest. Like the mainstreamreligions, the New Age believes in the existence of ‘light’ and ‘dark’, butthese polarities create each other. If you believe in the light you must believein the dark or you would not have to distinguish between the two. Belief in onecreates the other. There is no light or dark, this is one of the greatestillusions that pervade the Matrix. Light and dark are programs, the same withgood and bad, male and female. Everything is One. There are no divisions, merelythe illusions of them. ‘Demons only manifest in minds that believe in them’, thevoice in Brazil said. If Infinite Love is the only truth and everything else isillusion, how can demons be anything but illusions? I have said before that whatyou fight you become and it is also true that what we fight we create and givepower to. This is not a fight for the light or a fight against the dark oranything else. Fighting is a Matrix program. It doesn’t care why we fight or whowe fight, so long as we do.I have been seeking to show how all the religions, be they worshipped in achurch, stone circle or stock market, are the same God Program in differentguises. They are fundamental to the reality maze that is the Matrix and it isalways trying to guide you, through the DNA, onto a road to nowhere. If itdoesn’t get you one way, it will try another. This is not a condemnation ofthose who pursue a religion, only an effort to expose the traps that lie within.There are many wonderful people with big open hearts who advocate Christianity,Judaism, Islam, the New Age, Sikhism and all the others I mention. They have aright to believe what they do, as they have every right to say that I am talkingthrough my anal muscles. One radio caller in America even called me ‘Satan’because I said Jesus did not exist. Fine, it doesn’t matter to me because peoplehave a right to express their opinion and I say Jesus and Satan are differentexpressions of the same God Program anyway.I have been attacked and condemned by many Christians, Jews, Muslims, New Agers,all shades of political opinion, and even many of those researching the globalconspiracy. Normally these people would appear to have little or nothing incommon, but in fact they are profoundly connected. They all have a dogma todefend and I am challenging dogma and its imposition. This is why I seem tounite sections of these apparently disparate groups in mutual condemnation. Thereligions are different versions of the same program spawned by the Matrix, andin exposing this virtual-reality game I will inevitably upset those who allow itto think for them. If that is as it must be, no problem. They have a right tobelieve in their religion and I have a right to say what I do. It’s calledFreedom.Funny how religions, and people in general, want the freedom to promote theirown beliefs, yet seek to silence those who present another view. But, then,that’s the Matrix for you. Fairness and justice were never its strongest points.Sources > 1http://www.ascension-research.org/gwb.html> [http://www.ascension-research.org/gwb.html]> 2http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/gdpmanu/mahat_ch/m_c-5.htm> [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/gdpmanu/mahat_ch/m_c-5.htm]> 3http://ashtar.galactic.to/ [http://ashtar.galactic.to/]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT Another Look at ‘Society’ > Education is a wonderful thing, provided you always remember that nothing> worth knowing can ever be taught> Oscar Wilde If you believe the world is ‘real’, or that some benevolent god is in control,you can drown in the apparent contradictions we constantly experience. ‘Why arethings done this way when it would be much better for people if …’ WHOA, hold itright there.Societies are not structured to be ‘better for people’ or any other life form.That’s not the idea. They are designed to serve the Matrix, full stop, end. Whenyou observe what we call society from the perspective of the virtual-realitygame, and understand its agenda, you can see the method in the apparent madnesswe call ‘life’. The Matrix is a multi-dimensional, self-powered, free energymachine. The definition of free energy is something that produces more energythan it needs for itself. It is like your computer taking electricity from theplug for its own needs while somehow using that to produce energy for the wholehouse. The Matrix is a system which manipulates consciousness trapped within itsvibratory illusions to generate the energy that fuels the system. That energy isfear and its related emotions. To achieve this, the Matrix must:> 1Entrap consciousness in an illusory reality and cause it to ‘forget’ what it> really is – the Infinite One. This is done through the system of broadcasting> information in waveform that the DNA/RNA decodes into holograms that appear to> be a ‘solid’ world.> 2Manipulate consciousness to believe its thoughts and emotions are its own and> not the programmed reactions of the body software through the DNA. This is not> difficult when we are constantly hearing thoughts and feeling emotions. Why> would we think they were not ours unless we understand the game?

As Oneness is a state of> ‘no time’, any consciousness caught in the illusion of time will disconnect> from awareness of the One.

But> ‘tomorrow’ never comes and the carrot is always in the ‘future’. The crucial> word in this program is ‘hope’, which always locates your focus on some> distant point that never arrives because hope, by its very nature, exists only> as an illusory forward projection.

There are different versions of this throughout what we call history> (Figure 79).From these seven points the entire control of the Matrix is possible ifconsciousness buys the sales pitch, and the manipulation I described in chapterone [../Text/index_split_010.html#filepos13533] can now be seen in much sharperfocus. We can understand at a far deeper level why the Illuminati – the MatrixRed Dresses – are so obsessed with controlling the flow of information throughownership of the media. They want to prevent conscious beings from communicatingthoughts and facts that challenge the implanted reality of the softwarebroadcast through DNA. Also, by presenting the ‘news’ in a form that stimulatesfear, conflict and division, they are constantly activating the emotionalresponses in the DNA that slumbering consciousness misguidedly believes are itsown. In falling for these DNA emotional triggers, and allowing them to dictateits state of being, consciousness generates the fear that powers the Matrix. Itis like watching a horror film with the theatre feeding off the fear it producesfrom you. This is how the system produces more energy than it needs for itself.It takes energy to run the communication networks of the Matrix, but deludedconsciousness in a state of fear, stress, guilt, anger, hatred and frustration,generates far more. The Matrix also absorbs enormous amounts of fear from thedaily killing rituals of the ‘natural world’. Consciousness experiencing animalDNA software is similarly in a perpetual state of fear caused by predators andthe battle to survive. The Fear I Won’t Survive Program applies to animals as tohumans, of course, and so does, at least in most cases, the Fear My OffspringWon’t Survive Program, as with the example of the Grey Whale, among millions ofothers.image [../Images/00084.jpg]Figure 79: Behind the scenes Illuminati operatives and puppets, who often appearto be on opposite ‘sides’, work together to impose the global centralised state.Some do this knowingly while some have their actions manipulated withoutunderstanding the full implications of what they doControlling the information that people absorb is crucial to the Matrix becauseconsciousness must be held in the illusion by every means possible. I have usedthe analogy before of the ball floating on top of a tank of water. That is itsnatural state, floating on the surface, and to hold it on the bottom demandsconstant effort. The moment you let go, whoosh, it is back at the top againbecause that is its prime reality. It is the same with consciousness. If youdon’t bombard it with hypnotic messages to implant an illusion it is going torevert or, in the language of computers, ‘default’, to its prime state – Onenessin awareness of itself. The education system or Sausage Machine Program is avital part of this hypnotism. The ‘education’ program is encoded with three mainaims:> 1To implant a belief in reality in line with the Matrix illusion.> This is simple enough. You just give students the official version of science,> history, religion, mathematics and the world in general. You do this by> programming the teachers through school, university and teacher training> college and you send them out to program the next generation with the same> crap they have been told to teach and believe. As Oscar Wilde said: ‘Most> people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions, their> lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.’ Most teachers, like doctors,> scientists, media people and so on, are what my friend, Mike Lambert, calls> ‘repeaters’. They just repeat what someone else has told them instead of> accessing, through consciousness, their own truth. It is second-hand reality.> The process is similar to downloading information onto a disk (teacher) and> then making lots of copies (children and students). Little or nothing is> allowed to be discussed in the schools and colleges outside of this mainstream> version of life and there are few, if any, points of alternative reference> from which to observe this indoctrinated reality from another perspective.> Children go through this mind machine while living with adults (more> repeaters) who have absorbed the same programming and while watching a media> (still more repeaters) parrot the same official story. No wonder they believe> the illusion is real when every source of ‘information’ is telling them it is.> 2To turn children into robots who follow the orders of the ‘teacher’ (system).> This requires the Carrot and Stick Program. You make it much easier for> students to accept the will of the teachers (the system personified) than to> question their authority and what they tell them to believe. You reward one> and punish the other. ‘Do as I say and believe what I tell you’ is instilled> from the earliest of ages in the daily indoctrination we call school, college> and university. Exams are the system demanding to be told what it has told you> to think. They are proof or otherwise of downloading. When you download> something onto a computer a little box comes up that says: ‘Do you want to> open this file now?’ You open it to make sure the information has downloaded> correctly. This is what exams are. Maverick children who refuse to download> are considered a disruptive influence.

This is because the Matrix has such a grasp on human> reality that what is taught is pretty much universally accepted.

Another thing:> why shouldn’t adults be allowed to kiss and cuddle ‘in the workplace’? Jeeez,> only in the Matrix could affection be legislated.Control doesn’t only involve the suppression of information. It also targets theDNA/RNA and its central processing unit, the brain, to further scramble thecircuitry and the ability of consciousness to see beyond the veil. This is thereal reason behind the chemical additives in what we eat and drink, and all theelectromagnetic pollution. When consciousness dictates the reality of the DNAinstead of the program, none of this will matter; but while we are slaves of theDNA/Matrix reality we can be seriously affected. It is important to stress thatwe are in control if we open to consciousness because to say that this chemicalor that technology will cause this or that illness can program the computer tomanifest the outcome by believing in it. I wonder how many health scares triggerthe very problems they warn about? So I emphasise that the following can anddoes happen, but it doesn’t have to. We have the power to override it.Genetically modified food is produced by manipulating DNA and the idea is to usethis to manipulate our DNA. A vital point in relation to GM food is that DNA isinterchangeable between species. As that article in the San Francisco Chroniclesaid: ‘… DNA is a universal software code. From bacteria to humans, the basicinstructions for life are written with the same language’. A brain cell in onespecies, for example, will work in all the others (remember how the rat cellsflew the jet simulator). It is quite possible, therefore, to target and changehuman DNA through the DNA in what we consume – and that’s precisely what they’redoing. They’re rewriting the software to suit their agenda of control.In North America, GM food is in ever wider circulation and the Illuminatibiotech companies are seeking to exploit hunger in places like Africa to dumptheir foul products and rewire the people in that continent. When thesecorporations say they are doing this because they want to help the hungry anddowntrodden, it’s like the Nazis saying they built the concentration campsbecause they wanted to help Jews, gypsies and communists. Michael Meacher, theMinister of State for the Environment, sacked by Prime Minister Tony Blair in2003, has highlighted the lack of research and the serious risk posed by GMfood. He also said that Blair appeared uninterested in the science and wasdetermined that GM be given the go-ahead. This is because Blair is an Illuminatipawn following their agenda. Pressure on the UK government has delayed theofficial permission for GM crops to be grown in the UK, but those behind theplan know that the contamination of non-GM crops is like a cancer. The GM‘trials’ in Britain will have already contaminated a much wider area than thegovernment admits and once a new location has been affected it, in turn,contaminates even further. Plus the fact the UK is now controlled by theIlluminati European Union and this fascist power bloc will make the ultimatedecision. The EU, no matter how it presents its myth of ‘tough safety measures’,will eventually give the biotech companies (Illuminati) what they want unlessthere is a mass public campaign to stop it.The overseas experience has confirmed the dangers of contamination and thecreation of genetically modified ‘superweeds’. In Canada, contamination has beena disaster for non-GM farmers and a 2003 report in Mexico revealed that it wasmuch worse than believed possible. Analysis showed the presence in apparentlynon-GM crops of two, three and four GM varieties, all patented by transnationalbiotechnology companies. Once contaminated, even if it is your worst nightmare,the corporations can, and do, demand royalties for growing their patented crops!The arrogance of the biotech companies knows no bounds. In one media report,Simon Barber, a spokesman for the EU biotech industry association, EuropaBio,said organic farmers were being unreasonable to demand absolutely nocross-pollination. ‘Cross-pollination is normal and natural – it happens’, hesaid. What a prat. GM food is about control of the food supply, control offarming through GM ‘royalties’, even from those who don’t want it and,crucially, the manipulation of our DNA and it’s ability to communicateaccurately. This is part of a coordinated chemical, electromagnetic andvibrational onslaught against the human body, mind and emotions.The loudest voice behind GM is Monsanto of St Louis, Missouri, one of the mostimportant Illuminati companies on the planet. These were the guys behind AgentOrange, used to grotesque effect in the Vietnam War and this is also thecorporation marketing the brain-scrambler known as aspartame. This wasmanipulated through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ‘safety checks’ byDonald Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary under Boy George Bush, and CEO ofSeale Pharmaceuticals when he used his buddies in the Reagan–Father Bushadministration to have fundamental doubts about the safety of aspartame ignored.Searle later sold out to Monsanto and now aspartame is in an ever-growing numberof drinks and foodstuffs, a trend only stemmed by the fear of class actionlawsuits over its effect on human health.You will find aspartame in instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-freechewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatine desserts, juices, laxatives,multivitamins, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes,soft drinks, tabletop sweeteners, teas, instant coffees, topping mixes, winecoolers and yoghurt. And these are only some examples. Aspartame is 200 timessweeter than sugar and marketed under its own name and trademarked brands likeNutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, and Equal-Measure. Some of the 90 differentdocumented symptoms reported to be caused by aspartame include:headaches/migraines, dizziness, seizures, nausea, numbness, muscle spasms,weight gain, rashes, depression, fatigue, irritability, tachycardia (abnormallyrapid heart rate), insomnia, vision problems, hearing loss, heart palpitations,breathing difficulties, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, loss of taste,tinnitus, vertigo, memory loss and joint pain. The reason for this appallingcatalogue of disease is that aspartame disrupts the DNA communication system.The US Air Force formally warned all its pilots not to consume diet drinks intheir official flying safety bulletin in May and August 1992 because of theeffects of aspartame on their ability to fly a plane. Many other non-militarypilots have complained of the same symptoms, including seizures. A 1990 editionof Plane and Pilot magazine told the story of an Air Force pilot who traced thepatterns of tremors and seizures he suffered for two years directly to hisconsumption of NutraSweet. When he stopped drinking diet sodas his symptomsstopped, but when he resumed so did the tremors. His problems worsened until agrand mal seizure ended his career. But, once again, his symptoms disappearedwhen he ditched the NutraSweet. Plane and Pilot also reported this case:> ‘After only two cups of artificially sweetened hot chocolate, a pilot> experienced blurred vision so severe he was unable, in flight, to read the> instruments and very narrowly avoided a tragic landing. Safely on the ground,> he related his symptoms to the secretaries in his office. [He told] of> experiencing similar symptoms after ingesting aspartame products.’ Aspartame contains methanol (wood alcohol), a poison that causes blindness anddeath. Two teaspoons are considered lethal. Smaller doses destroy the brain (DNAcentral processing unit) little by little, because the effects are cumulative.Depending on the tolerance level of the person, the effects can be severe likeepileptic seizures, including grand mal, blindness, chest palpitations, blurredvision, bright flashes, tunnel vision, ringing or buzzing in ears, migraineheadaches, dizziness and loss of equilibrium. Other psychological problems arecaused by the phenylalanine in aspartame depleting levels of serotonin, a brainchemical and neurotransmitter that regulates, among other things, behaviour andsleep patterns. Laboratory tests have also shown that aspartame can change theDNA. Here we go again, and this is the prime reason behind the daily chemicalbombardment through food, drink and environmental sources. Imagine what theeffect on children is going to be of all the aspartame-poisoned shite they areconsuming by the bucketful today, especially in soft drinks.Damage to the brain and the DNA is a constant theme when you research thepoisons that infest what we consume, breathe, and absorb through technologies.Aspartame is what is called an excitotoxin, or neurotoxin, and so is the‘flavour enhancer’, monosodium glutamate, or MSG. You’ll find this in almostevery mass-produced foodstuff and it tricks the brain to taste more flavour thanis actually there. It is often disguised in the list of ingredients as ‘naturalflavour/flavourings’ when it is nothing of the kind in the form it is used. MSGalso hides behind terms like ‘hydrolyzed’, ‘autolyzed’, and yeast extract ornutrient, among many other pseudonyms. Americans alone are apparently consuming160 million pounds of this stuff every year and yet it is a brain poison. DrGeorge Schwartz, a toxicologist and author, says that two tablespoons of MSGwill kill a dog in minutes. Some of the health effects linked to MSG includeheart problems, Alzeimer’s, Parkinson’s, asthma, cancer, birth defects, obesityand … brain damage. MSG attacks what is called the brain–blood barrier, adefence system that normally prevents toxins entering the brain. Even tinyamounts of toxic substances like MSG and aspartame can cause the brain cell toso overreact that it becomes exhausted and dies. Hence they are calledexcitotoxins. MSG, a crystalline substance like DNA, damages parts of the brainlike the hypothalamus that govern many systems in the body.As with aspartame, MSG also causes food cravings and can make people fat. Theepidemic of obesity exploding across the world is largely caused by theseadditives, the use of which has mirrored the rise in overweight people. Thisepidemic is caused to a large extent by the effect on the hypothalamus thatregulates hunger and weight. Rats fed MSG became massively obese and theirhypothalamus was found to be in a shocking state. Another similarity withaspartame is the way MSG was allowed onto the market without adequate safetychecks and most of the later studies into its health effects have been conducted– as usual – by ‘researchers’ linked to the food giants. The food corporationsthat profit massively from MSG say that it’s safe. Phew, that’s okay, then, youhad me worried for a second.I mentioned in an earlier chapter how vaccines contain mercury. Even in smallamounts this, yet again, is known to damage DNA and impair its ability to repairitself. It also destabilises the neurotubules that are fundamental to normalbrain cell function. Mercury activates microglial cells and this, as withaspartame and MSG, increases excitotoxicity that adversely affects brainfunction. The potential neurological consequences include autism. Studies by theUniversity of Calgary Faculty of Medicine discovered rapid damage to brain cellsfrom minute amounts of mercury. They concluded that it causes neurologicaldamage consistent with Alzheimer’s. An indication of the potential for mercuryto devastate the DNA body–mind–emotion network is the story of an English womancalled Mary Stephenson. At the age of 21, she had 19 teeth filled with amalgam(52 per cent of which is mercury) and she began to suffer from cripplingsuicidal depression that no therapist or antidepressant could treat. It was only40 years of hell later that a friend suggested that her condition might becaused by her mercury fillings. She had them replaced, went on a mercurydetoxification course to clear the residue, and her depression disappeared.‘Every morning when I woke I thought, “Oh no, another day, how am I going to getthrough this?” Now I can’t wait to jump out of bed in the morning to get on withlife.’ The only difference was the mercury in her mouth that, as with allamalgam fillings, was seeping into her bloodstream and short-circuiting herbrain. The cell receptors that ‘catch’ the peptide chemicals secreted byemotional states are the same ones that absorb mercury and other chemicals indrugs, food and drink. As I said earlier, emotional chemicals affect the bodyand chemicals absorbed by the body affect emotions.The Illuminati want fluoride to be added to drinking water because it, too, is abrain and DNA scrambler. For many years it has been established that fluorideinhibits the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase. This is involved in transmittingsignals along nerves. Russian studies, both clinical and physiological,established that patients with dental fluorosis also suffered from disturbednervous activity and brain dysfunction. Chinese scientists reported in 1995 thatfluoride lowered the IQ. They compared children aged eight to 13 who had nofluorosis with those who had slight, medium and serious levels of it. Theirfindings revealed a five to 19 point decrease in IQ score for the children withsevere fluorosis compared with those who had none. A second study of childrenaged seven to 14 consuming different levels of fluoride confirmed the findings.Fluoride attacks the immune system, our Norton Antivirus, by diminishing itsability to recognise threats and causing what is called Autoimmune Disease.Cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and sclerosis are just some of the conditions thatresult from such malfunction. The effect of fluoride on the thyroid, whichregulates the metabolism, can cause endless problems throughout the body and a1955 report in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a 400 per centincrease in cancer of the thyroid in San Francisco during the period its waterwas fluoridated.Most people have no idea what is in this stuff and where it comes from. Theyjust accept without question that it is good for teeth because this is what theyare told to believe. Fluoride is a waste product of the aluminium industry andhas been used in rat poison. Now it is in many drinking-water supplies (withplans for continuing expansion) and almost every brand of toothpaste! The claimthat fluoride protects teeth from decay is nonsense and this lie is demolishedin And The Truth Shall Set You Free and in endless other publications andstudies. Dr Hardy Limeback, head of the Department of Preventive Dentistry forthe University of Toronto and president of the Canadian Association for DentalResearch, was his country’s leading advocate of fluoride. Then he woke up to thefact he had been given false data and that ‘the vast majority of all fluorideadditives come from Tampa Bay, Florida, smokestack scrubbers’. He said thatunsuspecting people were being exposed to deadly elements of lead, arsenic andradium, all of them cancer-causing. ‘Because of the cumulative properties oftoxins, the detrimental effects on human health are catastrophic’, he said. Astudy at the University of Toronto discovered that fluoride was ‘altering thebasic architecture of human bones’. Limeback also said that Canada was spendingmore money treating dental fluorosis than treating cavities. He said thatfluoride had been in Toronto’s drinking water for some 40 years while vancouverwas fluoride free, but that Toronto had more cavities per head than Vancouver.This scam is nothing to do with teeth. It is about its effect on the brain.The Nazis put fluoride in the water supplies of the concentration camps tomind-suppress the inmates, and destabilising brain function is the motivationbehind its wider introduction. Dr Limeback said that he had unintentionallymisled people for 15 years because he had refused to study toxicologyinformation readily available to anyone. ‘Poisoning our children was thefurthest thing from my mind’, he said. I admire his honesty, and his wordsencapsulate why we have a medical profession claiming to know what is safe andgood for us when all they are doing is repeating what the system tells them tosay and believe. They are just sitting on their lucrative perches saying, ‘Who’sa pretty boy, then?’Mobile phones are another attempt to short-circuit the central processing unit.Dr Gerald Hyland, a British physicist, said that if mobile phones were a type offood they ‘simply would not be licensed’. If Donald Rumsfeld was behind themthey probably would, but the point is taken. Dr Hyland’s findings were publishedin the medical journal, The Lancet, and reflect a gathering concern about theeffects on the brain of mobile-phone frequencies. One of his concerns is thatcellphone use can be linked with aggressive behaviour in children, but it goesmuch further. A study by the Spanish Neuro Diagnostic Research Institute showedthat a two minute call can open the ‘blood–brain barrier’, allowing toxins inthe bloodstream to kill brain cells. This is what MSG and aspartame do. Evensuch a short call also disrupts electrical activity in a child’s brain for up toan hour. ‘This has potential for psychiatric and behavioural problems andimpaired learning’, the Spanish study said. Sweden’s Lund University Hospitalsupported these findings and claimed that radiation emitted by mobile handsetsand relay towers can destroy cells in areas of the brain responsible for memory,movement and learning.Japanese scientist Masaru Emoto exposed water to the electromagnetic waves of amobile phone and you can see the impact by comparing Figures 80 and 81. Thewater crystal was slaughtered by the effect and that is what these phones andmasts are doing to us! Cellphone relay towers seem to be everywhere now and acommon location is near schools! In November 2004, a report by the BBC, alsodetailed in The Mail on Sunday, revealed how Britain had 40,000 mobile-phonemasts and one in ten schools had a mast located within 200 metres of theclassrooms. A Central London school had 27 masts within this distance, many ofthem hidden from public view inside road and petrol station signs.When three mobile phone giants: T-Mobile, Orange and Hutchison 3G, were allowedto erect a 25-metre mast near three schools in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, agroup of parents took the case to court. They wanted to protect their childrenfrom this blatant danger to their health, but the outcome was inevitable becausethe courts represent the system not the people. The local council had refusedpermission for the mast and the phone companies went to the High Court to havethe decision overturned. The parents didn’t want it, the local council didn’twant it, but it was forced upon them by judges hundreds of miles away in Londonwho will never go near the place. The parents challenged the decision at theCourt of Appeal, but Lord Justice Laws decreed that ‘perceived health concerns’would only be considered (by system-appointed judges) in ‘exceptionalcircumstances’ (when the system didn’t mind). Even the National RadiologicalProtection Board advises a ‘precautionary approach’ to locating masts nearschools, but Lord ‘Justice’ System knew best. ‘It remains central government’sresponsibility to decide what measures are necessary to protect public health’,he said. Oh, please.image [../Images/00085.jpg]image [../Images/00086.jpg]Figures 80 and 81: The effect of a mobile phone on water crystals – and thehuman body in this reality is mostly water! On the left the water was exposed towords of love and gratitude; on the right, what happened when it was subjectedto cellphone frequencies(For more examples see the books, Messages from Water, volumes one and two, byMasaru Emoto)As this book was going into production in 2005, Professor Sir William Stewart,chairman of the National Radiological Protection Board, published a studywarning parents not to allow children under eight to use mobile phones andhighlighting the potential dangers for all users. The report, ‘Mobile Phones andHealth’, said that four investigations had caused concern about the effect onthe brain of cellphone frequencies, including a German study that suggested anincrease in cancer around masts. Professor Stewart said that ‘evidence ofpotentially harmful effects had become more persuasive over the past fiveyears’. Translated, this means that governments have been quite happy to use thepopulation, including children, as guinea pigs for the transnationalcorporations, when anyone who had the most basic understanding of the workingsof the brain would know from the start how lethal they could be. There are 4,700new cases of brain tumours every year in Britain – an increase of 45% in 30years, according to the UK Brain Tumour Society. I wonder why? Duh?Neil Cherry, a biophysicist at Lincoln University in Christchurch, New Zealand,considers the proliferation of cellphones, microwave towers and microwavepollution to be a serious contributor to cancer, brain tumours and increasingneurological problems. Leif Salford, head of the Lund University research team,said the exposure of the brain to microwaves from mobile phones is the largesthuman biological experiment ever. As use of the technology continues to expand,he said, people may ‘drown in a sea of microwaves’. He warned that neurons,which would normally not become senile until people reached their 60s, could nowdo so 30 years earlier. ‘We can see reduced brain reserve capacity’, he said.This could lead to an increase in Alzheimer’s, or dementia and, at best, peoplewould have ‘a significantly diminished number of non-dysfunctional brain cellsand brain subsystems throughout their lives’. George W. Bush must have neverbeen off the phone. The point that even these researchers miss, however, is thatmobile phones and their towers are not a biological ‘experiment’ at all. Theyare part of a coldly calculated attack by the Illuminati on brain function.It’s not so much the power of electromagnetic emissions that poses the greatestdanger, but the frequency they resonate. The frequencies once again disrupt themessages passing between the DNA/RNA and this inaccurate and confusedinformation leads the cells and other systems to malfunction, just as a computerwould in such circumstances. The pulses of digital mobiles mimic the signals ofthe body’s cells and the DNA becomes an antenna for the frequencies emittingfrom the handset. How appropriate that they are called cellphones. The Journalof Cellular Biochemistry reported that heavy cellphone use could cause braincancer and other diseases by interfering with DNA repair of wayward cells. DrGeorge Carlo, an epidemiologist, conducted a six year study and found thatwireless phone radiation caused DNA damage. The common theme of all this crapthey are feeding us through food, drink and technology is … DNA damage anddisruption, especially to the brain. They are seeking to short-circuit theDNA/RNA communications to stop consciousness imposing itself in the Matrix.People with what used to be called mental handicap do not have a problem withtheir consciousness, but with its ability to be expressed through a damagedcentral processing unit. It is the same with mental illness. Outside of thisvibrational reality they are not handicapped or mentally ill, it happens on thelevel of DNA – the target of the Illuminati for humans in general.Yet despite all of this, the social programming is such that mobile phones arenow considered an essential part of childhood culture. A study reported in theUK Daily Telegraph found that mobile phones are ‘indispensable’ to teenagers andtext messaging is ‘an integral part of how they express and define themselves’.More than three-quarters of those surveyed agreed with the statement: ‘I couldnot bear to be without my phone’. The Matrix has them.I keep hearing how misbehaved children are today and how it is more difficult tocontrol them, and so on. But are you surprised? Children more than anyone arebeing deluged with attacks on their DNA and brain circuitry through thehorrendous chemicals in their soft drinks, fast food and vaccines, even withoutthe mobile phones and transmitter towers. A Time magazine article in April 1994highlighted the rise in child behavioural disorders. Attention deficithyperactivity disorders that had been unheard of 15 years earlier were affecting3.3 million American children when the article was published. Goodness knowswhat the figures must be today. Now let us do the maths: 1994 minus 15 = 1979.So the enormous rise in child behavioural problems began in the 1980s. MSG andaspartame (the duel attack is particularly damaging) had flooded the foodindustry by the mid-1980s and this is no coincidence.The system’s reaction to children affected by the poisons the system feeds tothem is to prescribe brain-damaging drugs like Ritalin and Prozac from thesystem’s pharmaceutical cartel to poison them even more. These drugs are alsoused to suppress children who refuse to download the system’s reality. Peter R.Breggin, Director of the International Center for the Study of Psychiatry andPsychology at Johns Hopkins University, says that Ritalin decreases blood flowto the brain and routinely causes other gross malfunctions to what I call theDNA’s central processing unit. As he put it: ‘Ritalin does not correctbiochemical imbalances – it causes them’. Other Ritalin effects include possibleshrinkage or other permanent physical abnormalities of the brain, disruption ofgrowth hormone causing suppression of growth in the body and brain, psychosis(mania), depression, insomnia, agitation, addiction, daily withdrawal reactions,impaired ability to learn, and the worsening of hyperactivity and inattention –the very symptoms the drug is supposed to improve! I found a website where youcan order Prozac, produced by the Bush family-connected Eli Lilly, withoutprescription. The section about side effects said you should consult your doctorif you experience any of the following:Fever; seizures; suicidal tendencies; heart pounding; anxiety; weakness; weightloss; loss of appetite; nausea; dry mouth; upset stomach; sleeplessness;nervousness; drowsiness; tremor; sweating; flu syndrome; headache; diarrhoea;dizziness; sore throat; sinus inflammation; sweating; gas; changes in vision;rash; yawning; decreased sex drive; abnormal dreams; impotence; abnormalejaculation; chills; bleeding; increased appetite; vomiting; weight gain;agitation; amnesia; confusion; changes in behaviour; sleep disorder; ear pain;changes in taste; ringing in the ears; frequent urination; increase in bloodpressure.Prozac is a brain reprogrammer like all the others, and it is handed out likecandy to children and adults under the guise of controlling bad behaviour. Butfar from doing that, Prozac has been linked to many of the children and youngpeople involved in infamous acts of inexplicable violence. One of the effects ofthese drugs is that people lose their capacity for empathy. Eric Harris was onProzac when he walked around Columbine High School laughing as he killed hisschoolmates, even those he liked. So were others who have exhibited similarbehaviour. What is happening to children is nothing less than legalised childabuse. The Illuminati are at war with the kids, especially with their minds, andso are the parents who won’t wake up to what is happening. Even when they dothey face the gathering power of the fascist state that seeks to control theirchildren. The Bush Administration launched the Orwellian ‘New FreedomInitiative’ that plans to introduce the compulsory screening of every Americanfor mental illness and they are starting with the kids. A ‘commission’ wasrecruited from the Illuminati pharmaceutical cartel in 2001 to study mentalillness in the population and it reported that ‘despite their prevalence, mentaldisorders often go undiagnosed’. As a solution to this problem it recommendedcomprehensive mental health screening for ‘consumers of all ages’, includingpreschool children, because the emotional disorders of childhood were often‘undiagnosed and untreated’. Who will decide who needs treatment? The governmentand the pharmaceutical cartel will – in other words, the Illuminati.All these attacks on brain cell communication will also be having consequencesfor the role of the corpus callosum that connects both hemispheres of the brainand transmits information between them. It is in the interests of the Illuminatito stop us integrating these ‘two minds’ into a unified whole because it keepsus in a state of imbalance and separation. They particularly want us to bedominated by left brain reality, which is mirrored in the materialistic,bottom-line, ‘western society’ that has colonised the world. The more they cansuppress information passing from the intuitive right hemisphere into the left,the more they will imprison perception in the world of ‘matter’, words andholographic form – the Time Loop. I’m sure the corpus callosum is a major targetof the chemical and electromagnetic onslaught on the human brain.I describe the microchip as the jewel in the crown of the Illuminati (Matrix)agenda because it is their most effective potential weapon in the control of ourDNA/RNA. Microchips are about surveillance on one level, but that’s not the mainmotive. They want people to be microchipped to give them a direct connection tothe DNA circuitry that regulates our ‘physical’ health and our mental andemotional states and responses. The mind and emotions are phenomena of the DNAand can be manipulated by reprogramming the DNA and the way the RNA reads theprogram. This is why the CIA scientist told me in 1997 that messages sent fromthe computer to a human microchip could kill people, cause severe pain orillness, and manipulate them mentally and emotionally. He said this includedmaking them docile or aggressive, sexually high or suppressed, and affectingtheir thought processes to the extent that they couldn’t think straight or wereinfluenced in their actions by what the chip was receiving. How appropriate thatthe central processing unit in a personal computer is housed in a singlemicrochip called a microprocessor. The Illuminati microchipping agenda is aboutinserting a mini brain which they control.Once you realise the nature of the game, and what the world really is, you cansee from a much wider perspective why the Illuminati do what they do. As I willcome to later, an awakening is gathering pace, and consciousness is beginning toimpose itself on the DNA program in increasing numbers of people. Suppressingthis by making the DNA misfire through attacks from microchips, GM food,aspartame, and all the other assaults on brain communications and activity, iswhat all this is really about. This war on the human body/mind/emotions includesgovernment policies to ban the use of health food supplements and vitamins, orto make the dose so small that it makes no difference.Illuminati societies are founded on dependency because this allows the few todictate to the dependent many and limit, again, through fear, what people willor will not say and do. Even most of those conscious beings that have begun tosee through levels of the game will not act or speak about their realisationsbecause they fear the consequences. These invariably involve fear of losing job,money or status, often all three. As I said in chapter one[../Text/index_split_010.html#filepos13533], society is structured as a pyramidof dependency with almost everyone having a boss to answer to. Through thisdependency, and divide and rule, the system itself becomes the governor. Afactory worker may have to answer to the supervisor, the supervisor to themanager, the manager to the CEO, the CEO to the chairman and the chairman to theshareholders. But in the end they all answer to, and depend upon, the system –It That Must Be Obeyed. The system is a Matrix program.No matter how powerful you may appear to be, even a president or prime minister,the system is God. World leaders come and go, as do top bankers and businesstycoons, but the system rolls on. It is designed to think for us and most peopleconcede their reality to its threats and seductions. Ask even genuinepoliticians why some humanitarian policy cannot be implemented and they’ll saythe way the system is structured won’t allow it. Why can’t we just give oursurplus food to people in poor countries who are starving? No, that woulddestroy local farmers and disrupt our own agricultural policy. Well, why don’twe have the transnationals give those people back their food-growing land sothey can feed themselves then? No, that would harm our big companies and affectfood supplies, jobs and the economy at home. Here are hungry people and here aretwo ways of feeding them, but neither is believed possible because of thesystem. It is designed to block changes that don’t serve its desire for thesuffering, stress and conflict that generate its life force – fear.Every year the BBC has a telethon, called Children in Need, to raise money fromviewers for kids and their families who are often desperate for help andsupport. The projects the money is spent on should be ‘gimmes’ in any decent,consciousness-led society. But children who are handicapped, in poor health,poverty or emotional distress, have to depend on a night of charity to enjoywhat should be a right. It is blatant confirmation that the system, and thosewho serve it, are deeply sick. In 2004, Children in Need raised £17 millionduring the evening from donations and fund-raising events across the country. In2003, more than £90 million worth of missiles, bombs and ammunition was fired byBritish forces in the first 11 days of the Iraq war. America is another countryplagued by poverty and basic need and yet estimates by the National PrioritiesProject using official records said that by the start of 2005 the cost of thewar had exceeded $152 billion (see costofwar.com [http://costofwar.com] fordetails). All this in a world in which, as the UN reported in 2004, a child diesof hunger every five seconds.To think that all those people voted for Bush because they said he stood formoral values. There is never enough money to help people, but always enough tokill them. Tony Blair, who committed billions to the Iraq invasion andoccupation, had the nerve to say how much he supported Children in Need (goodPR, see). ‘There’s this huge sense of coming together’, he said, ‘And the wholecountry comes together and says this is a cause worth supporting’. If Mr Blairwas not a system-serving software program the cause would not require supportbecause there would be no children – or anyone else – in need. But the systemwants the wars and it wants the suffering. There are no contradictions betweenmoney spent on need and money spent on war once you realise why the system isstructured as it is.The priorities of the Matrix, and the Red Dress programs I call theIlluminati/Reptilians, are not the same as incarnate consciousness. One wants togenerate fear and the other desires happiness and joy. This simple understandingreveals so much about why the world is how it is. We may cringe at the dailyslaughter in the killing fields of Iraq, Israel and endless other locationsaround the world where horror is a way of life. We may survey the tens ofmillions killed and maimed in the two world wars and reflect on how appalling itall was. But to the Matrix, wars are orgasmic orgies of fear that provide itspower and means of existence. A war, especially a world war, is like havingbillions of power stations feeding energy into the grid. Not only do the troopsand civilians immediately involved generate terror and stress, so do all theirrelatives and entire populations worried about what the outcome will be. It isnot only wars that do this. Society in general is designed to keep the energyflowing.The study I mentioned about anxiety and depression in teenagers increasing by 70per cent in less than 20 years is terrible news for anyone seeking a happy,joyous and harmonious planet. But to the Matrix it is a magnificent five-coursedinner. The fear of those Jewish people terrified of breaking ‘God’s Law’, andall the other religious followers controlled by the same software, are alsoterrific generators of energy for the Matrix; so is fear of the future and guiltfrom the past; fear for the kids and regret about the kids; fear of losing yourjob and anxiety that you won’t get a new one; fear of what people will think andthe frustration of not being yourself. Look at your own life and the world ingeneral and it is a global power station generating fear, frustration andanxiety. If you observe what we call history, you see that every generation hasbeen in fear and under stress for different reasons. Humans (and animals caughtin the Laws of Nature Program) are manipulated to fear and vampired by theMatrix for the energy it produces. The Red Dress programs of the Illuminati areencoded to create the division, conflict, war and anxiety that serve this end.The complexity of the system is structured to act like little flying mitesbiting you and getting you ever more frustrated as you symbolically wave yourarms around in search of peace. It wants to keep you in a constant state ofanxiety and worry. I am talking about all the forms to fill in, tax laws toobserve, speed cameras to watch, licences to keep valid, and this is nowintensified by the ‘war on terror’ and political correctness which pressures youto pre-scan everything you say. Even the ludicrous, incomprehensible roadsystems and one-way mazes in many towns and cities are squeezing morefrustration from us as we go round and round looking for a way out (see LosAngeles). The same goes for traffic jams, lawyers and the endless red tapedesigned to suffocate and frustrate us. I am sure you can name a long list ofthings that frustrate you in the way the system operates. And here’s the point.At the level of control from which society is manipulated, it is meant to befrustrating. It might appear to be bureaucratic incompetence and stupidity, andthere are serious numbers of incompetent and stupid bureaucrats, but to the RedDresses it is calculated design to keep us anxious, frustrated and boxed in.Actually, when I wrote that last sentence I mistyped ‘incompetent’ as‘impotent’; it was an appropriate slip. Bureaucrats may seem to have power, butthey are really only impotent cogs in the machine and they are as controlled bythe Matrix as anyone, often more so because of their rule-obsessed,law-obsessed, do-it-in-triplicate mentality.The Matrix wants incarnate consciousness to be a mirror of the DNA software. Inother words, to react to stimuli/input like a computer does. This is one reasonwhy society is so robotic with, for most people, every day pretty much the sameas another and ruled by illusory time measured by hands on a clock face. Thestructure of society is a barrier to spontaneity and increases the speed atwhich we concede our uniqueness to robotic responses. I mentioned this earlierwith reference to education, but the same applies everywhere. Spontaneity is themusic of the soul, the inspiration of the One – and maverick spontaneity is theworst nightmare of the Matrix. It opens your DNA to the realms beyond theillusion and it sings to a different resonance, beats to a different drum. Thespontaneous is constantly targeted with an endless array of laws that say do,don’t and can’t, or insist you have the right form, licence or permission beforeanything can be done. The insane multi-million lawsuits issued when people havethe smallest of accidents are now seeing the most innocuous games and pastimesbanned that were part of everyday life when I was a kid. Most of the idiotsbehind this political correctness have no idea that forces they cannot begin tocomprehend (remembering to breathe is a challenge) are behind this nonsense tofurther erode what we are allowed to do without the sanction of authority. It isthe Matrix program operating through its imbecilic zombies that think theycontrol the bureaucracy.The car park at the apartment block where I live has been patrolled by a private‘security’ firm contracted by the management company to stop people parking inspaces designated for residents. I had nothing to do with this decision, but Iwas given a card to put on my windscreen to stop me being issued with a fine forparking in my own space. When one day the card had fallen from the screen aparking ticket was stuck to the car by this security firm demanding £60 – wellin access of $100 for, yes, parking in the designated space I had been using forsome four years. When I invited the firm not to be so ridiculous they said itwas a ‘legitimate ticket’, even though they accepted that I had every right topark there! Only when I made it clear that they would go to their maker stillwaiting for the money was the demand dropped. This is the level to which we havenow descended in terms of policing each other and, in doing so, serving thesystem of control. The system is structured to make one person’s loss anotherone’s gain and this provides the incentive for the divide and rule on which itdepends.Another expression of the robotic agenda is the way diversity of culture isbeing consumed by a universal, vacuous, wasteland known as the ‘modern way oflife’. It is a land of fast food and fast ‘news’, instant coffee and instantopinions, the worship of celebrity and irrelevant banality, the soulless kingdomof the five senses. The cities in this one-track world look ever the same, theirdistinctive diversity lost to sky-scraping concrete and corporate identity. Itis the perfect backdrop for the robotic mind and is, indeed, its creation. Thewhole rationale of the planned global dictatorship is to complete this cycle ofrobotic uniformity through a world government, central bank, currency and army –underpinned by a microchipped populous. What we call globalisation is designedto stop whole countries from being spontaneous and making decisions that fittheir particular wants and needs. You can’t do this or you’ll face a fine fromthe European Union and you can’t do that or you will face a fine from the WorldTrade Organisation; this decision can’t be made without permission from the IMFand that decision can’t be acted upon without sanction from the World Bank. Ah,yes, banks.The entire banking system, controlled by the Illuminati Red Dress families, hasone aim in its programmed mind: to suppress choice (spontaneity) by makingalmost every choice dependent upon the ‘money’ it controls. Choice is linked tomoney and money is controlled by the banks, so the banks control choice. Or weare led to believe they do. The idea is to shackle the population with aconstant need to earn money to survive another day, week or month. Hate yourjob, unhappy and frustrated every day? Well, that’s just too bad. You have thatmortgage to pay, debts to service, and a family to feed. What do you think youare, Infinite Consciousness? Keep their heads down, concentrating on survival orpursuing some system-defined ‘success’, and they will be prisoners of the fivesenses – the DNA. Gotchaaaaaaa!Here you have the main reason why society is obsessed with the five senses ofsight, touch, sound, taste and smell. Virtually everything, certainly everythingproduced by Illuminati manipulation, is aimed at this. Watch any group oftelevision advertisements and the five senses will be the target. These sensesare the access codes to the DNA and its central processing unit because they aredecoded and defined by the brain and the DNA/RNA network of crystallinetransmitter/receivers. What you taste and how it tastes to you is decided by thebrain/DNA, as is what you see, feel, hear and smell (or believe you do). Thefive senses are illusions and they are fundamental to holding us in the biggerIllusion, the Matrix. What you eat, with few exceptions, is produced withchemicals and poisons from Illuminati biotech and pharmaceutical companies thatmanipulate your brain and tell you what to taste. What you think you see isdefined by what the Illuminati, through control of media and education, havetold you to see. What you hear, like music, is produced by Illuminaticorporations who decide what artists to support and sounds (frequencies) tomarket. Hook the five senses and the fish will swim in the Matrix unaware ofwhat lies beyond the surface. If we look again at the words of writer MichaelEllner, we can appreciate with an even greater awareness why the world is as hedescribes. He said:> ‘Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors> destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge,> governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions> destroy spirituality.’ The why is now obvious:> •Doctors destroy health because they are pill dispensers for a pharmaceutical> cartel that seeks to control people – not heal them.> •Lawyers destroy justice because the ‘law’, together with banking, is one of> the major means of control and suppression.> •Universities destroy knowledge because the Illuminati want an ignorant> population programmed to believe the illusion is real.> •Governments destroy freedom because they are Illuminati corporations designed> to dictate to the people – not serve them.> •Major media destroys information because its role is to captivate the five> senses and peddle the illusion.> •Religions destroy spirituality because they were not created to free the> spirit, but to trap it in a web of fear, limitation and ignorance.This world of illusion is founded on the need to survive and the fear of notdoing so. Pick any point on the Time Loop DVD and you will find the samescenario: control through dependency and the perceived need to survive. TheMatrix itself is in fear of survival, the loss of the energy source on which itdepends, and it has structured the illusion to mirror its own state of being.How could it do anything else? Its ‘laws of nature’ are the very epitome of thesurvival mentality that generates its food source. Crucial to the fear of notsurviving is the Fear of Death Program. It is this that motivates the constantpursuit of survival to postpone our inevitable fate. Fear of death is thespectre that haunts our society and inspires the desperation to survive at allcosts. Chinese philosopher Chang-Tzu said of this:> ‘The birth of a man is the birth of his sorrow. The longer he lives, the more> stupid he becomes, because his anxiety to avoid unavoidable death becomes more> and more acute. What bitterness! He lives for what is always out of reach! His> thirst for survival in the future makes him incapable of living in the> present.’ It is the fear of oblivion, Judgement Day or the fires of Hell, depending onwhich version of claptrap you choose to believe in. When Rabbi Furst prepares todepart for that great Cheese Danish in the sky can you imagine his terror ofwhat may await? It’s so sad when our only punishment is that we which inflict onourselves. We followers of Bollockism do not fear death, nor punishment, forthey do not exist. There is only Love – the rest is illusion. To know this at adeep level is to be free from the fear that concedes control to the Matrix andwithout which it cannot prevail. While chemicals in the food and mobile-phonefrequencies do affect us in our Matrix state, they don’t have to. They areillusions too, more subplots in the movie. We can connect with realms ofconsciousness in which the laws of the Matrix do not apply because they are seenfor what they are – figments of delusion. When we access that level of awarenesswe can rewrite the program in the DNA and cease to be at the mercy of fear anddis-ease.Freedom is the absence of feardom and this is the revelation that will bringthis silly game to its rightful conclusion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE It’s all Bollocks > The play was a great success, but the audience was a disaster> Oscar Wilde The most effective way to disconnect from the manipulations of the Matrix is tolaugh in its face. Once we take it seriously we become attached to the gamethrough mind, emotion and fear. The Matrix only exists because we believe itsillusions are real, but we don’t have to.The mind-game has such a grip on reality that people get angry, obsessive oroutraged about the most irrelevant bollocks and this myopia cements their arsesto the web. In fact, it’s all bollocks. There is nothing, except Infinite Love,that isn’t bollocks. But oh, my – how we get caught. For example, I made thepoint in I am me, I am free, about the word fuck. Oh my God, did he really saythat? ‘Ethel, he’s just said that rude word, it’s outrageous.’ I love it hownewspapers, moral guardians that they are, always write the word as f***. Whatthe fuck is that all about? When you see f*** what goes through your mind? Fuck,exactly. So it is morally OK to think fuck, but not to say it. What bollocks!Nothing encapsulates how deeply the Matrix has control of the human psyche thanour attitudes to the word fuck. It may not be the most beautiful of sounds, butif you hit your thumb with a hammer I challenge you to find a better one to sumup your feelings. Like all words it can be said with venom, matter-of-factly, orin humour and it is the energy and intent behind a word that has the effect, notthe word itself. Fuck is just a sound that can produce a disruptive orharmonious resonance depending on the intent. So what’s the big deal about thisword when the same is true of all the others? Once again it’s programming. Weare told from childhood that the word is taboo and this imprint dictates thelifetime reaction in most people when they hear the dreaded four letters. To saysexual intercourse is fine, though not encouraged because even that’sembarrassing to many, but its one syllable stablemate is definitely persona nongrata. Yet imagine if fuck meant something else, say sandwich.Two pieces of bread with something in the middle is believed to be named afterthe fourth Earl of Sandwich because, it is said, in about 1762 he asked for meatto be served between slices of bread to avoid interrupting a gambling game. Hehad originally intended to take the title of Earl of Portsmouth and, if he had,we would now be eating portsmouths. It is also quite possible that if the earlhad left his gambling game to have sex with a maid thè word sandwich might nowbe slang for sexual intercourse. It would certainly give new meaning to Tm goingfor a sandwich’. Today we have no problem asking for a sandwich, but there wouldbe indignation, indeed horror, if you asked for a fucking sandwich. Howdifferent it would be if the roles were reversed and by some quirk of events asandwich was called a fuck. It would be fine to ask for a cheese and tornatofuck, heavy on the mayo, but moral outrage would ensue if you asked for asandwiching fuck. I can say buck and that’s OK. I can say duck and that’s OK.But when I say fuck, there are knickers twisting in every direction. It’s sopathetic and if we can get this uptight about a single syllable word, whatchance have we got of extricating ourselves from the trillions of far morepowerful ways the illusion attaches itself to our sense of reality? It’s thesame with nudity. They say a perfect God created the human body and then condemnyou for showing it. For goodness sake, they are just illusory willies andillusory breasts. If the taboo programming was not there in the first place noone would give a toss about nudity (Figure 82).image [../Images/00087.jpg]Figure 82:I am me, I am free. What’s the big deal about nudity? It is aholographic illusion anyway, but if the religions believe that their ‘God’created the body, and that God is perfect, why are they so ashamed to show hiscreation?Answer: programming.People talk about wanting to be free and yet they can’t get past first base bynot being outraged by a bare bum or a single word. Deep breath … Fuuuuuuuuuck.There, see, did anyone die? No one’s been hit by a lighting strike or a cruisemissile? It’s just a fucking word and we are Infinite Consciousness – AllPossibility. Jeeeez. I saw a notice outside the studios at a Los Angeles radiostation listing all the words a government agency decreed could not be used onair. It said the fine for doing so was $500,000. One of these words was … shit.You can say excrement and pay nothing, but use the word shit for the samesubstance and you are threatened with a fine of half a million dollars. Give mea shove will you? I’m ready to wake up now. We are so focused on the twigs, likefuck and shit, that we can’t see the trees, let alone the forest. I am notsaying everyone should go round swearing if that’s not their choice, but ifsomeone else does, so what?Sex is another of the moral stickies that keeps people attached to the illusion.I saw an American right-wing Christian say that he was worried about gaymarriage and wanted Bush elected to stop it. He was worried about gay marriage?Well, I think I see a way out of this: don’t marry a gay, then. There, simple,what shall we do now? I am tempted to start an Internet advice column and callit noneofyourbloodybusiness.com [http://noneofyourbloodybusiness.com]. Whatright has anyone to decide if a gay marries a gay? It’s their business and whatthe hell are we doing moralising about relationships never mind legislating forthem? Whether you are gay or what they call ‘straight’ it is only a softwareprogram transmitted from and through the DNA/RNA. Infinite Consciousness is AllPossibility, the balance of everything, and it doesn’t have our version of ‘sex’in its non-Matrix form. The super-hologram is where ‘physical’ sex takes placeand gay or straight it doesn’t matter. They are both expressions of duality, asis all that male–female stuff. It only happens in the realms of illusion anddivision. From the perspective we are discussing here, the sexual act, whetherbetween ‘straights’ or ‘gays’, involves inserting a holographic illusion into aholographic illusion and our central processing unit telling us if we areenjoying it or not.‘Willy to brain, are you receiving me?’‘Loud and clear, Willy, just worried about premature ejacula … oh, there yougo.’I know I should be taking this more seriously because I heard a sex therapist onthe TV talking at length about this ‘serious problem’. What baloney. Prematureejaculation is caused by fear of premature ejaculation and the fear of notgiving a ‘good performance’. Someone asked me if I was good in bed and I said Ididn’t know because I am asleep at the time. Maybe I should fix up a camera tofind out. This ‘being good’ business means getting your partner’s body computerto agree that you are good. If you can do that you are macho and, in the tabloidjargon, a ‘great lover’. This is don’t-scare-the-children speak for being greatat sex, by the way, and should not be confused with being a great expresser oflove. Sex that involves consciousness can be an awakening experience and infusenon-Matrix energy into the DNA, but an obsession with sex of merely thebody-to-body kind can lock you deeper in the Matrix because it is only a meetingof DNA and central processing units. It’s like linking a PC to a laptop so theycan exchange information. I say, what a pair of portals on that one. There’snothing wrong with connecting computers and it can be entertaining, just likebody-sex can be. It is not a matter of right and wrong, but of understandingwhat is happening so we dictate events and not the software.When the Matrix wants us to focus on something it must be important for controland this is true of the obsession with sex. Without sex many tabloids would beleaflets. I am waiting for Who’s Who to publish a new edition called Who’sHaving Who because from what I can see they would sell out. There is anobsession with ‘celebrity’ sex that appears to be far more important than whatthe ‘celebs’ actually do.‘I think that woman’s a great actress.’‘Really? What movies has she made?’‘I can’t remember, but I know she’s had it off with Ryan O’Neal.’Sex sells newspapers along with the explosion of ‘celebrity’ magazines and, mostimportantly, it sells the Matrix. The sex drive comes from the reptilian brain,as does the interest in celebrity gossip. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, author of CrimesAgainst Nature (HarperCollins, New York, 2004), said of the media: ‘They’reairing stories that appeal to the prurient interests that all of us have in thereptilian core of our brain for sex and celebrity gossip, and now for terror’.Once again, this is no coincidence. There are calculated motives behind theselling and, perversely enough, the suppression of sex. Anything that holdsfocus in the five senses is of fundamental service to the Matrix and nothingdoes this more effectively than sex because it is an extremely powerfulfive-sense experience exchanging messages between the cells and brain. Thedesire for sex, which occupies people for far longer than the act itself,operates in the same way. Sexual fantasy makes you aroused simply by thinking ofthe experience. If you think of something that turns you on, your body willbegin to react as if you were in a sexual situation. They talk about drugs andalcohol as addictions, but for many so is sex. In these cases they don’t havesex – sex has them. It can grip them every bit as much as other addictions andhold them in five-sense reality. None of this is a problem so long as you knowthat the ‘physical’ is illusion because then you can enjoy it without gettingcaught in the trap of believing it to be real.The Worship Your Willy Program is not only there to entice people to haveendless sex; the game is more subtle than that. Newspapers and magazines areobsessed with the sex lives of the rich and famous few but, at the same time,they moralise about sex and make people feel guilty about it. ‘We are exposinghow this celebrity had group sex with three women. Isn’t it disgusting?’ Well,actually, as long as they were all in agreement, no it’s not. This stuff isinvariably written by moralising hypocrites who would love to have made it afoursome. The media is like the moral crusader who condemns pornographic videoswhile watching one after the other to confirm how terrible they are. They putsex in your face to sell papers while condemning ‘immoral behaviour’ and makingyou feel bad for doing the same, or even thinking about it. Another theme isthat the celebrities have money, fame and sex with the beautiful people and,well, er, you don’t. You are just an onlooker in life and we have launched thiscelebrity magazine so you can pay us to peek at what you will never have andnever be, OK, HELLO? See how inadequate you are? Success is fame, fortune andbeing a sexual icon. Doncha’ just wish you didn’t work down the laundry?This stimulation of envy and unfulfilled desire, especially the desire for sex,creates an ongoing frustration that can suppress the whole energy system of thebody-mind-emotion network processed through the DNA/RNA. Frustration of anykind, not least sexual, can scupper the flow and manifest as disease, depressionand sexual obsession. The Roman Catholic Church insists that its priests don’thave sex and the same church has a global problem of priests using children forsex. One creates the other because whatever you suppress becomes an obsession.Energy flows where attention goes. To waft something in front of you and thensay you can’t have it, or should feel bad about it, is bound to stimulate anobsession with whatever’s being denied and this happens with sex all the time inthe media. Writer Oscar Wilde said: ‘The only way to get rid of a temptation isto yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the thingsit has forbidden to itself’. Precisely, so long as you are not imposing yourwill on someone else.Celebrity is the new religion with every genuinely talented or cynicallymanufactured ‘star’ sold as a Jesus Christ, albeit a fleeting one, to the packof manipulated followers. Your old hero may have faded, but here’s another fromthe Jesus factory; production never ends. Your software programmers have nowdecided that Rock is out and Rap is in and so that’s what you’ll get; and whenwe decide that Rap is now crap, we’ll give you your Rock back, or Hip Hop, orDisco, or whatever we decide while making you think the decision is yours. It’sa brilliant form of mind control called marketing, or ‘hype’ for short. Peoplequeue for hours in the rain for a brief glimpse of some film star or singer intheir one-night designer frocks that cost more than the drenched congregation inthe pews behind the security fence will earn in months. Performing someoneelse’s script in a credible way, or singing a good song well, can put you on the‘A’ list of iconic celebrity. They are the new pantheon used, like the old one,to sell an illusion within an illusion. John Wayne was a military hero withoutever fighting a battle and, as we saw in California, a bodybuilder with thevocabulary of a three-year-old can be elected to political office simply becausehe grunted his way through some movies. The fact that he grunts his way throughhis political speeches, as well, is irrelevant in the ashram of celebrity when‘We love Arnie’ is the only mantra in town.We are told what to look like, what to say, what to think, how to act, who toworship, what to strive for. Norms are our guiding shite. But we are InfiniteConsciousness – All That Is. What are we doing playing Little Me–Big Arnie whenthere is only one Infinite I? The Matrix seeks to divide this infinite unity byevery means possible. Observe the ‘world’ and you will see a billion fault linesdesigned to divide and rule. We have religions, races, nations, classes, incomebrackets, men and women, politics, ad infinitum. The list is endless because newones are being added all the time. This is essential to the Matrix because itdepends on duality to manifest its vibratory illusion and it must keep entrappedconsciousness in a state of perceived division to stop it connecting inawareness with the One.Politics divides people all over the world, and billions take it seriously whenpolitical office is the almost exclusive bastion of the corrupt, stupid ormyopic. It’s not a matter of who we should vote for, but why we should evenbother when the system is so blatantly rigged. You wouldn’t let Boy Bush run amarket stall without parental supervision and yet he’s a two-term president whosends young men and women to kill and be killed while others of his mental ageare at home playing with their Lego (Figure 83, overleaf). But people get socaught in this irrelevant tripe, as if their vote will change anything. ‘Who doyou think we should vote for? What do you think about Bush on the economy andKerry on defence? What about their wives, which one would be a better firstlady? Do you think Kerry would be better on Iraq? And what about his record inVietnam, do you think he was telling the truth, and what about Bush avoiding thedraft …’ Will you shut-the-fuck-up?! It’s all bollocks.image [../Images/00088.jpg]Figure 83: George W. Bush … the prophecy of his coming:‘As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and moreclosely, the inner soul of the people.‘On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach theirheart’s desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downrightmoron.’H.L. Mencken (1880–1956)I give you Political Elections for Dummies, which, as you will gather from thetitle, is particularly aimed at anyone who voted for George W. Bush. Bothcandidates in US ‘elections’ (and other significant ones around the world,including Britain) are funded by the major Illuminati corporations andcontrolled by the same force. Global politics is just a game to fool the people(Figure 84). The money is handed over – well in excess of a billion dollars toBush and Kerry in 2004 – and, in return, the piper asks the payer what music helikes. Those who funded the Bush campaign in 2000 have made incredible profitsfrom the decision to invade Iraq by providing the weapons to destroy the countryand the ‘expertise’ to ‘rebuild’ what their bombs had devastated. This includesthat infamous duo: the Carlyle Group, fundamentally connected to father Bush,and Halliburton, the oil services giant headed by Dick Cheney until he left tobecome US vice-president and minder to the juvenile delinquent.The ‘party’ system of politics was designed by the Illuminati to make it easierto control. Instead of having to manipulate hundreds of individuals making freedecisions according to their own conscience, they only have to control the partyhierarchies. In the UK, we have the ‘Whip’ system in which the party leadershiptells it’s Members of Parliament how they will vote every day. If the MPs don’tfollow these orders their political careers go no further, and yet they aresupposed to be representing the people who voted them into office, not the partydictatorship. In fact, most bills that pass through Capitol Hill and theparliaments of the world are not even read by the Congressmen, Senators and MPsbefore they vote them into law! American ‘Anti-terrorist’ legislation that hasdestroyed fundamental freedoms since 9/11 had not been read by the voting fodderwhen they supported its introduction, as US Congressman, Ron Paul, has pointedout. This party structure is perfect for the manipulators because all they haveto do is control the leaders to dictate what policies the party will support.The Illuminati make sure they have their placemen in control of all the majorpolitical parties (and many others) and this allows them to daily manipulate the‘democratic process’. What we staggeringly call ‘democracy’ is another word fordictatorship.image [../Images/00089.jpg]Figure 84: Neil Hague’s depiction of the ‘Lucifer’ – Matrix – card game in whichthe people are constantly dealt from a marked deckIn 2004, Bush and Kerry were both initiates of the Skull and Bones Society, anelite secret grouping for chosen ones from the Illuminati bloodline families.There are a few hundred initiates of the Skull and Bones Society alive at anyone time and some 295 million Americans; but somehow this secret society managedto supply both candidates at a ‘free’ election. The Illuminati couldn’t lose.Whatever the result they would have had their guy in the White House, and Bushand Kerry would have simply pursued the same course using different rhetoric tokid the people that they did have a choice. Both candidates were asked abouttheir Skull and Bones membership in an interview on the Public BroadcastingService (PBS) and both refused to talk about it. Bush said it was ‘too secret’.The interviewer let them get away with this evasion when he should have askedthem why two potential Presidents of the United States would not tell the peopleabout their secret society background because it was ‘too secret’. What the helldid they mean it was secret and what were the implications for open governmentof this secrecy? But you can spot most American journalists and television‘news’ presenters quite easily; they are the ones on their knees with theirtongues sticking out preparing to lick.Terms like Republican and Democrat, Labour and Conservative, are masks on thesame face. But, as in 2000, the man the Illuminati really wanted was George W.Bush because his so-called ‘neocon’ (fascist) controllers, who orchestrated thewar on terror, had their networks in place throughout the government and theywere to be left there to complete the task of setting the world ablaze anddestroying America. So, for the second time, the vote was rigged for Bush, notleast through electronic voting machines with no paper trail to prove thedesired choice had been recorded. Just trust us, okay? The machines wereprovided by Bush-supporting corporations that also counted the votes! Among themwas Diebold Inc. of North Canton, Ohio. Its chief executive, Walden O’Dell, wasa top fundraiser for the Bush campaign who wrote a year earlier that he was‘committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president … ’ Itmust have been entirely a coincidence that somehow Ohio managed to record 90,000more votes than it has registered voters! There were also other vote scamsdetailed since the ‘election’ on the headlines page of my website: davidicke.com[http://davidicke.com]. To be a stooge in this corrupt farce, millions stood inline for up to seven hours for the ‘democratic right’ of making an irrelevant‘choice’. We also had the insane situation in the so-called ‘beacon ofdemocracy’ of having the crucial election in Ohio run by Ken Blackwell, thesecretary of state, a co-chairman of Ohio’s committee to elect George Bush! Thesame was the case in Florida with secretary of state Katherine Harris when avote scam there gave Bush the presidency in 2000. The governor of Florida wasJeb Bush, the idiot’s brother. America is not even a democratic country, letalone a free one, but still most of the electorate continue to take politicsseriously.The power of manipulating the reptilian brain is such that staggering numbersalso legitimately voted for Bush in 2004 and they sure seemed to have figured itall out before heading for the polling booths. Bush had made decisions thatslaughtered tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and more than 1,000 troops, butChristians voted for him because he was ‘pro-life’. He triggered chaos andviolence around the world and removed basic American freedoms, but half theelectorate voted for him as the best man to protect them and their freedom. Heis a womanising, coke-snorting liar responsible for the death and suffering ofmillions and yet people voted for him to protect marriage and American morality.He is an idiot with the intellect of a pea, but people voted for him as a ‘wiseleader’. He used his father’s contacts to avoid the draft to Vietnam and, likehis blueprint, John Wayne, has never seen a bullet, let alone a missile, firedin anger. But tens of millions voted for him because he showed courage insending others to die on their behalf. The greatest irony is that a vote forBush was seen as a vote for American patriotism, when the Illuminati are usingBush to destroy America. World government and superpowers do not go togetherbecause the superpower has the financial and military might to tell the globaldictators where to shove it. What we are seeing is Bush being used to front aplan to exploit American troops and resources to advance the agenda for globalconquest while, in doing so, destroying the United States as a financial andmilitary superpower. They want to engineer an eventual conflict with China inpursuit of this goal.‘Yeah, but why do you think the people wanted Bush more than Kerry? Was itbecause Kerry’s a liberal and soft on terror, or …?’Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!Race is also a big player in the game of divide and rule. What we call ‘races’are different software programs. They are compatible because most of the DNA isthe same, but the minute differences lead to varying skin colours, facial shapesand body size. Racism is like saying ‘Google’ is better than ‘Yahoo’. I saythere is no place in this world for Google supremacists, the Yahoo caste systemor anti-Spamitism. The divisions of race are illusions, but powerful ones forthe billions caught by the DNA.The appalling murder of Ken Bigley, the British hostage beheaded in Iraq in2004, provided a telling example of what a sense of race and nation can do toincarnate Oneness. There were religious services of respect and remembrance,government announcements of deep regret, Tony Blair reading from the Bible, andeven a minute’s silence before a World Cup soccer match between England andWales. I understand this because what Ken suffered was unimaginable. But whereis the outpouring of grief, the government statements of deep regret, religiousservices and a minute’s silence for the now tens of thousands of Iraqis who havebeen killed and maimed as a result of the American and British invasion of thatcountry? Are the children who have been blown apart or seen their parents,brothers and sisters scattered in pieces, not worthy of the same respect andresponse that followed the horrific killing of Ken Bigley? Why such a responsefor one Englishman, but not for all those dead Iraqi men, women and children,perhaps even 100,000 according to one study? A sense of race and nationhood,that’s why. Ken was ‘one of our own’. And that’s it, you see. When theunderstanding is lost that we are all One and division is illusion, we forgetthat everyone and everything that exists is ‘one of our own’.Instead, we are trapped in the Proud to be British Program and Proud to beAmerican Program (available in all languages like the Proud to be German andProud to be Iraqi Programs). Even these have subdivisions such as the Proud tobe Texan or Proud to be a Londoner Programs. This software insists that peoplehave to be born on the same illusory piece of land as we were if they are goingto be considered ‘one of us’. When you watch English professional football gamesyou will see the home crowd hurling abuse at a player on the opposing side. Butwhen that same player represents the national team the same people cheer him!These are different levels of the One of Us Program. Such software has beenresponsible for endless wars with the populations programmed with the ‘us andthem’ mentality fuelled by fear and ignorance. It leads to all sides killingpeople they don’t know, have never met and would probably get along fine with ifthey did.American and British troops have killed all those civilians in Iraq while Arab‘freedom fighters’ have responded by beheading American and British civilians,along with others from countries not even involved in the invasion. The troopsand the retaliators are the same software and so the same mentality, but theythink they are different and on opposite ‘sides’. The software sells theludicrous idea that you can judge people by the colour of their skin or theshape of their body when all is the same one consciousness entrapped byillusion. If people like where they live or were born that’s great so long asthey know it’s not real. By the ‘Proud to be British/American Programs etc’., Imean to believe that people born or living in ‘your country’ are somehow betteror more important than others, worthy of more respect and attention; and to putthe interests of ‘your country’ before the interests of justice for all.Many of the best-known conspiracy researchers and writers are wired to the Proudto be American Program as well as the God Program. I once went to a farm nearTucson where I’d been told a group was meeting to discuss the conspiracy. Therewas a massive Christian cross next to the farmhouse and a guy was sitting alonenearby taking a break from a lecture. As we chatted, the extent of his bigotrybecame clear. From what I now know, I would say he was definitely something outof Windows 95, maybe even an early prototype. I asked him how he squared theidea of some long-lost American freedom with the treatment of the native peopleswhen the settlers arrived. He said that God had designated this land for whitepeople and the ‘Indians’ were only keeping it for them till they arrived. He,and his like, hanker for some mythical time when the United States was reallyfree. Reality check: it never has been. Was it freedom when the Europeansarrived to slaughter the native population in a genocidal mass murder? Was itfreedom to force them into poverty and starvation on reservations that wereoften little more than concentration camps? Was it freedom to coldly kill thebuffalo simply to destroy the way of life of the native peoples and make themdependent on you? Was it freedom to purposely give them smallpox to kill as manyas you could? Was it freedom to impose the Christian religion on them, andEuropean settlers, through inquisition, violence and psychological fascism?There never has been a free United States and there never will be until thepopulation frees itself from the illusion of God Bless America, Land of theFree. ‘How can you say that when it’s the greatest country in the woooorld?’Bollocks. There are no countries. They are software programs that only exist assignals decoded in the brain. They are illusions written into the program todivide, rule and delude us. You are not American, British, South African,Mexican – any of them. You are Infinite Consciousness experiencing a holographicillusion designed to make you believe you are American, British, South Africanor Mexican.By the way, some people think that when you expose the centralisation of globalpower you must be a nationalistic flag-flier. Well, some are, but the only goodthing about flags for me is to tell you the wind direction. I watched anAmerican cowboy show in which a John Wayne sound-a-like said: ‘Look after yourflag and your flag will look after you’. Given the dishevelled state of him Ithink his flag was in breach of contract. My challenge to global centralisationis about people having control over decisions that affect them, not pulling upthe ladder and repelling all boarders. Nationalism and global centralisation aretwo expressions of the same bollocks.There is a smaller version of these polarities known as parents and family. Theparents invariably provide the centralisation of power and families, in general,operate on nationalistic lines – ‘We’re family, we look after our own’. Again, Ican understand this, but it’s still illusion. The only difference between aparent and child is the point where they entered the DVD/movie. The ones thatentered at point A become the parents of those who enter a few scenes down thedisk. They are parents only because they combined their DNA software to providethe holograms for others to experience the Time Loop. This ‘blood is thickerthan water’ stuff is still more illusion. You can feel an empathy and connectionto someone you have known for ten minutes that you will often never experiencein a lifetime of trying with parents and siblings. This connection can happenwithin families, but it doesn’t have to, as we see in so many cases. Even then,it is not the illusory holographic ‘family’ that is behind the connection, butthe consciousness directing the software we call the family. It can also be thatthe DNA (body-mind-emotions) is programmed to be attracted to another programfor a mutual experience in the Reincarnation–Karma illusion, but this is adifferent level of connection, often more a marriage of convenience thanInfinite Oneness. I love being with my family and seeing them develop and I’mnot for a moment saying that people shouldn’t operate as a family unit if thatis what they choose. We simply need to understand what a family really is andthen we can enjoy the experience (or walk away) without the illusion controllingus. If we don’t have this understanding, families can be a nightmare that hauntsus for a lifetime.Many parents seem to believe that they have the right to tell their children howto think, what to believe and how they should live their illusory lives. Thearrogance of it never ceases to stagger me. I saw in that Jewish Law televisionseries how children are brought up from birth to follow the strict and extremebeliefs of their parents. A boy’s hair is not cut until he is three because Jewsare commanded not to touch the fruit of the tree until the third year. At thatpoint comes the ceremonial cutting of the hair, leaving the ‘sacred side locks’,and from this time he has to wear the Jewish cap. He is three and has no say inwhat religion, if any, he wants to follow. It is the same with Jewish babiescircumcised only because religious law demands it, and Christian babies baptisedinto the church without any choice in the matter. The day after the hair-cuttingceremony (the Sikhs must be aghast) the Jewish toddler is taken to school to betaught the Hebrew alphabet. The shorn lad in the documentary looked totallybewildered at what was going on, but he had seen nothing yet. A lifetime offollowing the letter of the Torah awaited him.Even the way children get out of bed is governed by the dictates of Jewish law.They have to dress from the top down with the right side clothed before theleft. The kids are programmed with robotic behaviour from the earliest of ages.They have to put on the skullcap the moment they wake, and a bowl of water isbrought for them to wash their hands. Rabbi Dovid Jaffe explained that the handshave to be washed immediately because ‘they might have touched areas in thenight which are spiritually unclean’. This is what is known to others as‘scratching the bollocks’. If God made bollocks, how can they be spirituallyunclean? Girls and boys officially become adults in orthodox Jewish law at 12and 13 respectively, when they become responsible for all their deeds, not theirparents. From this moment they are not allowed to touch a member of the oppositesex until they get married, not even their brothers or sisters. One mother toldus how difficult it could be to avoid contact when receiving change in a shop.The trick was, she said, to hold your hand lower so the change could be droppedin. Why are they doing dumping this nonsense on kids of 12 and 13? Happy BarMitzvah, my boy, welcome to a lifetime of fear and suppression.Other faiths also impose their will on children through parental and religiousdictatorship. Who are these people to tell their children what they will believewithout giving them any choice or access to other possibilities? Can you imagineadvocates of the Jewish faith encouraging their children to look atChristianity, Buddhism or this book before deciding if they want to follow theendless laws of Judaism that will dictate every aspect of their lives? Not achance. Neither would Christian parents in relation to Judaism and otherbeliefs. No, your parents are Christian or Jewish and so you children will go tochurch or the synagogue and wear this cross or that hat. There has to beparental guidance for children to protect them from harm, but that is not thesame as telling them what to believe and forcing your program on their reality.None of my children have followed a religion, but if that was their choice goodluck to them. It’s their life, not mine.If young people want to be free they need to be strong enough to decide forthemselves what to believe; they need to reject the download and not allow theirparents or peer pressure to batter them into submission. Parents can be expertin playing the guilt card and making you feel bad because you don’t do what theysay or desire. If you want to be free, don’t fall for that old mind game. Ifparents can’t respect their children’s right to freedom of belief then sod ‘em,I say. They concede their right to be taken seriously. There are many fantasticparents who allow their children to develop without pressure and imposition, andmany others who go the other way and couldn’t care less about what happens totheir kids, never mind offer guidance and support. Whichever type we have it isup to us to follow our hearts and not any parental blueprint downloaded into ourreality. I can understand why people go through their entire lives feelingguilty about not living up to their parents’ expectations, or are resentful atthe way their parents treated them. But, hey, I bring you glad tidings of greatjoy here. It’s all bollocks. In fact, there are no parents, only holographicillusions we call ‘family’. It is consciousness, not family, that connects us.Let us not forget, either, that the pendulum swings both ways. Children can alsoimpose their will on their parents and use their own pack of guilt trips. ‘Ohmother, you shouldn’t be doing that at your age, it’s embarrassing.’ Well, pissoff then and spare your embarrassment, the door is over there. Parents agoniseover not being around for their children because circumstances prevent it. Butwe are Infinite Oneness; we are the ‘parents’ and the ‘children’, and thedivision and ‘space’ in between us are more illusion. I know how hard it can beto live that awareness, but only when we express love without irrelevantattachment can the freedom-bell ring.Parental pressure is often connected to a major piece of software called the YouMust Make Something of Your Life Program. This means ‘succeeding’ in ways thatthe system – and people programmed by the system – say constitutes success. Thisrelates overwhelmingly to one of two things, usually both: status and money. Wesee the status software in what we call celebrity, but it extends to all thejobs and titles that make us a ‘success’ in the system’s terms. This includesthe status of being a president or prime minister, lawyer, judge, chief ofpolice, military leader, doctor, top businessman, stockbroker or televisionnewsreader. These are illusions perpetuating the bigger illusion and that’s whythe system stamps ‘success’ on their CVs. Why wouldn’t the system – the Matrix –want people to aspire to the roles that most serve it? It is no accidentwhatsoever that the occupations deemed most ‘successful’ are those that mostserve the system. But this success business is worth a closer look:Presidents and prime ministers are puppets of forces dictating their decisionsand, in the case of George W. Bush, and many others, it’s clear that a moron canbe ‘successful’ by reaching the ‘highest office’. He may be called President ofthe United States, but he is still a moron. His status makes no difference tothat, except in our manipulated perception, and to climb the greasy poll ofpolitics you need to have corruption in your blood and the ability to lie byreflex action.Is that really success?A lawyer serves the system by administering laws drafted to imprison thepopulation in a mountain of codes, regulations and red tape. Mainstream lawyerscharge so much for their system-serving that it denies the great majority ofpeople access to the process or the chance to challenge the impositions ofgovernment, courts and police who are able to use taxpayers’ money to defend thesystem from the same taxpayers they are supposed to be serving. They use thepeople’s ‘money’ to imprison the people. Most of the ‘laws’ that lawyersadminister are a fraud anyway.Is that really success?Lawyers that arse-lick the system most enthusiastically and unquestioningly canprogress to become an even bigger success called a Judge. These ensure that thesystem’s will invariably prevails and those that can be most trusted to reachthe ‘correct’ decision will always get the high-profile cases that the systemmost wants to win. They are system-fodder, like politicians, and many are deeplycorrupt within a fundamentally corrupt ‘legal’ cesspit.Is that really success?Police officers play the same role, enforcing laws to impose the system’s willand defending it from challenge. Even the many genuine ones are forced toconform or they’re out. Police officers don’t primarily serve the people, theyserve the system, with honourable exceptions. It is the system that pays themand, through their uniform or warrant card, gives them the power over othersthat so many crave.Is that really success?The military fight wars and invade countries in line with the system’s agendawhile selling this insane human slaughter to themselves and the people as‘defending freedom’. Many have seen by their experience in Iraq what pawns theyare and how little the politicians who send them into battle care about theconsequences for them and their families.Is that really success?A doctor is a mobster’s moll in the organised crime syndicate known as thepharmaceutical cartel. This dictates the treatment that doctors prescribe (likecancer = chemotherapy) along with the national medical associations that thecartel controls. Doctors are programmed with the official view of the body andhealth throughout their ‘training’ and if they accept this Stone Age version ofmedicine the system rewards them with their qualification papers. As a result,one of the biggest causes of death is doctors.Is that really success?Leaders of transnational corporations are deemed to be extremely successfulpeople earning gigantic salaries. But what about the mayhem they cause acrossthe world? They seize food-growing land and cause the local people to go hungry;pay them a pittance to work horrendous hours after all alternatives foremployment have been destroyed; and bribe corrupt governments and securityagencies to target anyone who challenges their corporate dictatorship. Whatabout the murder and genocide that many of these corporations perpetuate and thewars that are fought to defend or advance their interests?Is that really success?Stockbrokers can make so much ‘money’ that some of the most expensive areas tolive in London are often referred to as the ‘stockbroker belt’. But what arethese people, really? They are professional gamblers like those playing thetables in Las Vegas. The only difference is that the stockbroker is playing withthe lives of billions across the world who take the consequences of how theseguys ‘invest’ (gamble) their clients’ ‘money’. A good deal for them can meanpoverty and hunger for people they don’t even know exist. We have wholetelevision channels dedicated to reporting the roulette tables of Wall Streetand the City of London under the guise of the ‘financial markets’. They might aswell report from a poker game at the MGM Grand. Stockbrokers may be feted forbeing so rich, but they make their ‘money’ from the manipulation and misery ofothers.Is that really success?Television newsreaders and their fellow journalists present the world in theform that constantly reinforces the illusion, and report events in ways thatsuit the system and Problem-Reaction-Solution. Most – though not all – are doingthis because they have no idea what is really going on and merely repeatofficial sources. Other ‘stars’ of the small screen present the mind-numbingbanality that dominates the output and hypnotises the viewers into lifelongslumber.Is that really success?No, it’s all bollocks. There are some within all of these professions who do tryto buck the system, but look at what happens to a doctor who wants to treat hispatients with methods that challenge the pharmaceutical dictatorship, or theuniversity professor who tries to give his students a wider vision ofpossibility. Like the genuine police officers, journalists and others, theyeither conform or they’re out of a job. So the most successful people in thesesymbols of success are those who serve the system most slavishly. This is bydesign, not default.Whenever ‘success’ is being calculated, money will be in the mix somewhere,often right out in front. Newspapers and magazines blitz us with reports of howrich people are, as if this was a measure of anything. It’s not even a measureof how much money they have because there is no money – only recycled debt. Ifthere is no money how can anyone have money or owe money? A guy may be anarsehole, but he’s a billionaire arsehole so that gives him status. Why? Oftenit’s the very fact that he’s an arsehole that made him a billionaire because ofthe ruthlessness necessary to acquire all that debt, sorry ‘money’. The pursuitof status, power and control through money has made people slaves to itsillusions. It has distorted our reality and tethered us to the system throughboth the desire for success and the desperation to survive. You can work withenormous dedication to help people, or make a profound contribution to humanunderstanding, and earn very little. But you can make a fortune simply by buyingand selling a house while doing nothing except living there or leaving it emptyuntil the market goes up.‘I say, Bill and Ethel have made £200,000.’‘Wow, that’s successful; what did they do?’‘They lived in their house.’‘And … ?’‘That’s it.’Even this is often more illusion because if you want to buy another house, theyare all more expensive, too. All this does is make fortunes for speculators andincrease the cost of a basic human right – a home – for everyone else. This isgreat for the Matrix because it means you have to work for longer to earn the‘money’ for a home and serve the system even more unquestioningly. While I waswriting this chapter the news in Britain was full of stories about a ‘pensioncrisis’ and how millions are going to live in poverty when they retire becausethey haven’t paid enough into a pension all their working lives. People as youngas 40 are now worrying about what is going to happen to them 25 years hence.Fear of the future is the biggest fear of all and includes the fear of ‘death’.That is what this pension ‘crisis’ is really all about – generating fear. It isbeing proposed that people be forced to pay up to 15 per cent and more of theirincome into a pension scheme and fear is being used to sell the idea. The realmotive is to provide an enormous inflow of fictitious funds to the Illuminatiinsurance companies who invest it in line with the Illuminati agenda. Those whocontrol the banks are the same people who control the insurance companies andthe same people who control government taxation. The whole economic system is amagic-show with the same magician in control.‘Money’ is only figures moving around computer screens and we can create as muchor as little as we choose. It’s another illusion within the illusion, anothersubplot in the movie. We have poverty through lack of money when there is nomoney, and we have people living in mansions through ownership of something thatdoesn’t exist. Yet we spend our lives trying to acquire more and more of thestuff and those with lots of it are given special status. You have got to bloodylaugh. The Illuminati have hijacked the means of exchange by introducing themoney fraud. As a result, they have hijacked the dreams of the people – whichare largely related to the need for money to achieve what they want, or havemoney as the end in itself. One of the main reasons the Illuminati have targetedthe formerly self-sufficient ‘Third World’ countries is to destroy theirself-sufficiency and make them dependent on money. Once achieved, he whocontrols the money controls the country and its people through dependency ontheir means of worthless exchange.What’s more, we are urged to pursue the god they call ‘economic growth’. We aresupposed to cheer when they announce a rise in economic growth because thatmeans the country is ‘doing well’. But economic growth is merely the amount ofmoney changing hands for goods and services. That’s all it is. When someone isadmitted to hospital or when an oil tanker pollutes a coastline they are addingto economic growth because they involve money being spent. A war adds massivelyto economic growth for the same reason, as we can see with the hundreds ofbillions spent by the US military alone. On the one hand we say illness,pollution and war are highly undesirable, but on the other the system’sbalance-sheet records them as economic success! ‘Money’, the stockmarketcasinos, and economic growth are all expressions of the same bollocks.Much of the clamber for system-style success is motivated by insecurity and aneed to be recognised for achievement. Such is the way the system underminesself-confidence that people find it extremely difficult to find security fromwithin. They must have confirmation they are adequate or successful by otherstelling them so. For this to happen, given the perception of success, they haveto achieve according to the system’s rules.Children are prime targets for this programming, particularly the so-called‘tweenies’, or ‘tweens’, aged between eight and twelve. ‘Get them young and keepthem for life’ is the system’s motto. A BBC Panorama documentary in November2004 highlighted the ‘tweenie’ obsession with brand-label clothing produced bythe Illuminati transnationals. These companies make fantastic profits often byproducing their clothes in sweatshops in the poorest countries and shipping themto the West to sell at top-notch prices. This is called ‘free trade’, by theway. The marketing and brainwashing is such that children now apparently have aterm for kids who don’t wear brand clothing. They are called a ‘Niki-no-name’.One nine-year-old said in the documentary that if she was not allowed brandnames she would ‘refuse to wear my clothes and … just stay in my pyjamas’. Sheadded that she hated being called a ‘little girl’ because ‘it reminds me of mychildhood’ and she revealed the tragic extent to which so many young childrenhave submitted to the hive mentality: ‘If I see someone wearing something, likefor example, a poncho, if I like it I’ll count it as one … When I get to five orsix [people in a poncho], that’s when I think I’ve got to have it’. A12-year-old asked how his attitude to brand clothing could be called anobsession when every other kid of his age was like that. This same boy stressedthat he did not buy the latest trends because he would be a sheep and look likeeveryone else. But then he revealed how he only shopped at a certain brand-labelclothes store! Mary Macleod of the UK National Family and Parenting Institutemade an astute observation:> ‘Children may think that they are making choices when actually they have been> captured by a choice. They have been captured by an identity rather than being> able to discover their own identity. So there are a range of identities> offered to them and they have to slot into one.’ Exactly. And it’s the same with adults. There is no greater way to manipulatesomeone than to make them believe they are making the choice when, in fact, youare. It gives them a sense of being in control when they’re not and, as I havesaid many times, people don’t rebel about not being free when they think theyare. The nine-year-old in the Panorama programme told how the Niki-no-namechildren were bullied and picked on for not wearing brand clothes. Asked whatshe would do if a friend did not wear brand names, she said: ‘I would still betheir friend, but I wouldn’t hang around with them so much because you are goingto get bullied with them’. One parent had the answer to this lunacy – give in tothe system: ‘If they are getting hassle for something that can be solved so easyby buying the right pair of trainers – buy the right pair of trainers. Why everhave it as an issue?’ It took a 12-year-old schooled at home to introduce somesanity to this madness. Imogen Donaldson did not want to wear famous brandlabels and she pointed out that we are not what we wear or how much money wehave. She said she had only been in schools on rare occasions and she found them‘lifeless, a bit like a prison’. This is what they are and they provide anenvironment for peer pressure to dominate and indoctrinate. Imogen, free fromthis environment, was able to see clearly what brand names really represent:> ‘It’s as if someone owns you. The original word came from a long pole with a> logo on the end that was burned into a cow’s side and showed the farmer owned> them. So just having the company’s name across the top shows that they own you> or something.’ The Illuminati network sees the population in exactly those terms – as cattle.It markets pop singers, like Britney Spears, that it believes will bestinfluence the tweenies, and the kids download the image to which they aremanipulated to aspire. This includes kitting out the pop icons in the designerbrand names, just as they do with sports stars, because they know the programmedtweenies will demand to wear the same. It is an indication of how far theprogramming has gone when you think that people once used to be paid to go roundthe streets wearing sandwich boards that advertised a shop or business. Nowpeople pay the highest prices for the privilege of being a sandwich board forNike, Boss or Ralph Lauren and kids are given a hard time if they don’t, orcan’t, do the same. Yet again it is seeking success on the system’s terms forthe system’s benefit. ‘My tee-shirt says “Armani” on the front, so I’ve made it!Yours says nothing – you’re a failure.’Mention of pop singers brings us back to the pursuit of status and money as asymbol of success. When you see these Pop Idol shows on television, and theirburgeoning offshoots, there are thousands of people willing to undergo the mosthorrendous ridicule for the faintest chance that they will become a ‘star’. Whatagony they go through waiting for some ‘celebrity’ judge like Simon Cowell todecree their fate and what relief and gratitude follows their progress to thenext stage of their exploitation. ‘Oh, thank you Simon; I’m so grateful Simon.’I’m not having a go at Cowell as a person, he may or may not be a very nice chapbehind his cultivated image, but the way he is seen by wannabe ‘stars’encapsulates how the system controls us through a desire to succeed on itsterms. Fame is such a drug because the sense of security comes from without, notwithin, and has to be constantly fed. This is not always the case and there areexceptions to everything I am saying, but it is a common theme. People look toothers to tell them how wonderful they are and many of the most famous andlauded actors and singers are the most insecure of personalities.System-dictated success is their emotional crutch.Once we fall for this one we are handing control of our lives to those we seekto impress. Whatever we think will impress or attract the ‘right people’, thatis what we do. Soon we don’t know who ‘we’ are anymore because the paintedpersonality has taken over. Why do we have to impress anyone? Bollocks to SimonCowell and the millions of other self-appointed judges throughout society thatwe concede our power to. You are already a star because you are the InfiniteOne, All That Is and Ever Can Be. Are we really saying that the Infinite has toimpress a hologram called Simon Cowell or anyone else? Are you kidding? TheInfinite – YOU – doesn’t have to succeed by being a president, lawyer, judge,pop star or anything else. You are everything, including Simon Cowell and allthe other illusions that people think they have to impress – the boss, kids atschool, parents, teachers, sports coaches, the public in general. It’s allbollocks.We don’t have to impress people because we’ve already made it and there wasnever a moment when we hadn’t. We are always the One and we have just beenmanipulated to forget. This amnesia has made us creatures of the DNA Matrixwhich perceives in terms of division, hierarchy, success and failure, us andthem, little me. Simon Cowell is considered a success because of the StatusThrough Fame and Money Program. Why is he thought more successful than a roadcleaner or refuse collector? Which one would you miss most if they didn’t reportfor work for a month: the guy taking your trash away on a truck or the guybringing it to you on a TV screen? The reason the refuse collector is notconsidered a success is the reverse of what makes Cowell a ‘star’. He lacksstatus because he lacks fame and money. But status is so illusory and irrelevantbecause it depends on a job title and/or what the system designates as status.One day you can have power and status and the next you retire and it’s all gone.It wasn’t you who had the power and status, but the job title owned by thesystem. So it is with people in uniform. They don’t have the power – the uniformdoes. We have allowed the illusions of the Matrix to distort our values,perceptions and even our dreams. If you have a need to be seen as successful,the Matrix has you. If you have a need to be liked or respected, the Matrix hasyou. If you think someone is more successful than another because of their fame,status and money, the Matrix has you. But it doesn’t have to be like that.Imagine yourself lying on a bed with ten minutes to live. Okay, not the mostpleasant of thoughts (unless you follow the same football team as me), but it’san important point I am making and a good way to unplug from the illusions ofthe Matrix. You know you have a few minutes left in this ‘world’, so, in thatmode, what matters to you now? Does it matter that you didn’t get that job youstrove for all your life? Does it even matter if you did? Was all that effort,worry and sacrifice worth it for the temporary, illusory, status it brought youin the eyes of those controlled by the system’s perverted ‘values’ of success?Does it matter that you were a president or prime minister, or neither? Does itmatter that you were a lawyer or a judge, or neither? Does it matter that youwere chief of police, a top businessman, doctor, television presenter or the guywho swept the roads? Does it matter that you were a billionaire or struggled topay the rent? Does it matter that you had power over people and could tell themwhat to do? Does it matter that you were seen as a success or failure, a geniusor crazy? Success and failure, genius and madness, are only points ofobservation anyway.Most people in their last moments can see the futility of it all, the pursuit ofmoney and system-implanted versions of success. The trick is to suss this beforesuch beliefs have dictated your life, but even then it doesn’t matter becausethat’s an illusion, too. Vital to this realisation is not to get caught in thesubplots, the diversions. All the aspects of society I have described in thischapter are subplots in the movie: politics, religion, celebrity, fame, money,sex, race, nation, success, family, fuck, shit – all of them. Yes, and even theIlluminati conspiracy. It is important to know how we are being manipulated onthe five-sense level, but if we leave it there we won’t see the true nature ofthe trap we are caught in. If we get too focused on the subplots we won’t seethe movie.The Matrix is a web of flytraps to keep us in the illusion and the way out is tostop identifying with it. That means to change our perception of self from thehologram, with its name and sense of limitation, and know that we are InfiniteConsciousness. When we identify with being human we are identifying with the DNAprogram and that is not who we are. It is this program that frets about peoplesaying ‘fuck’, having gay relationships or winning Pop Idol. It is this thatdictates most people’s thoughts and emotional responses and in our ignorance wehave allowed the computer to control the keyboard. But it cannot do this if wealways remember one simple fact:Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is bollocks."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN Logging Off > To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance> Oscar Wilde> Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much> Oscar Wilde Unless we stop this identification with self as a body we call human, we willcontinue to be slaves to the illusion. What we believe, and how we perceiveourselves, can either hold us in servitude or set us free.If you identify with your name and your body you will have thoughts and emotionsthat relate to limitation. Try it and you’ll see. It has to be that way becausethe whole foundation of the DNA program is to project an illusory holographicworld based on rules and, by their very nature, rules always mean limitation. Ithas its ‘solid’ walls, laws of physics, illness, ageing, cycle of birth anddeath, and endless lists of reasons why something can’t be done. It is the realmwhere but is king. I’d like to do this, but, … I’d like to go here, but, … I’dlike to heal myself, but … The Matrix is feeding us the ‘but’ mentality throughour DNA and when we falsely identify with that program our consciousness becomesenslaved by illusion.It’s fascinating to sit quietly while you listen to your thoughts and feel youremotions in a way that makes you the observer and not the experiencer of them.Normally we operate as if we are our thoughts and emotions, and we identify themwith who we are. We see them as our ‘personality’. According tohyperdictionary.com [http://hyperdictionary.com], the definition of‘personality’ is: ‘The complex of all the attributes – behavioral,temperamental, emotional and mental – that characterize a unique individual’.What that describes is different versions of the DNA software as read by theRNA, or what are known to psychologists as archetypes. There are no uniqueindividuals because we are all One and, even if you relate the definition onlyto this reality, there are still no unique people unless consciousness –Infinite Possibility – is involved. ‘Behavioral, temperamental, emotional andmental’ are all expressions of the program – the archetypes – and onlyconsciousness can provide uniqueness as we perceive it. What makes us ‘human’,as opposed to Infinite Consciousness, is the program.We misunderstand what emotions are and therefore identify with them. We relateemotion to love and caring, but it is a false association. ‘Love’ and ‘emotion’are not the same thing, and nor does emotion have anything to do with empathy.Love, in its true sense, is Oneness and within the balance of Oneness there isno emotion in the way we experience it in the illusion. There is only the joy,bliss and love that come with unity. Emotion is a part, not a whole. Empathycomes from Oneness, because only through that can we fully connect with anotherexpression of the One. Emotion is not love or empathy; it is a series ofprogrammed reactions and they are constantly being manipulated.If you find that quiet spot and listen to your thoughts and emotions, ratherthan identifying with them, you will realise they are not you. It is importantto the experience not to respond or react to what you hear and feel as theyglide by. Just observe them, unattached from whatever they are prattling onabout, and certainly don’t judge them or they will pull you in. In the end it’slike listening to the radio. It is said that we are not our thoughts, we are thesilence between them, and it is from this level of consciousness that we candetach from the program. When you observe your thoughts and emotions, thechatterbox in your head that never seems to shut up, you can experience thetruth of that. The silence is your consciousness; the chatter is your program.Consciousness is silent because it has nothing to say. It doesn’t think, itknows, and knowing doesn’t need to constantly waffle on trying to work thingsout. Nor is it forever worrying about the ‘future’ or regretting the ‘past’ –the major source of mental and emotional discourse. In stark contrast to mindand emotion, consciousness is real chilled.It can be funny to observe how our thoughts and emotions react to daily life.They can be stunningly dumb and dominated by fear. From the observation point ofconsciousness their reactions become so predictable and their programmed natureso obvious. I mentioned earlier about people in relationships who play emotionalpinball with first one reacting and then the other. This can cause terrificconflict, and the cycle can only be broken when the couple stops reactingaccording to DNA program. Until that happens the rider is being ridden by thehorse. When we stop reacting to program all that remains is consciousness andconsciousness can tell the RNA ‘laser’ to read ‘physical’ reality in a differentway. The software is all about reacting; it’s what the Matrix wants us to do.When we react we identify with the program and consciousness chases the whiterabbit. In doing so, its state of being mirrors the thoughts and emotions itbelieves to be its own and generates the energy that feeds the Matrix. Once yourealise that your programmed reactions are not you there will be far moreharmony and peace in your life. There are still moments when the program willcon you into reacting, but the more you express consciousness the less this willhappen and the quicker you will apply the brake when it does.As you log off from the software and log on to consciousness, you will develop aspontaneity you never had before. This is the worst nightmare for the Matrixbecause it is a manifestation in this reality of Infinite Possibility. Some ofthe Illuminati’s own documents say that mavericks (spontaneous people) are thebiggest threat to their plans. Spontaneity does not concede its freedom to butsand the rules and regulations of programmed society. I’d like to do this but, …No buts – just do it. But what will people think? Just doooo it. Or even betterjust beeee it. How many times have you wanted to do something in the moment andthen had your spontaneity mugged by thoughts and emotions listing all thereasons why you shouldn’t? By the time you have processed it all, thespontaneity has already been extinguished by a programmed fire hose called‘can’t’, ‘mustn’t’, ‘guilt’ and ‘what if’? Spontaneity does not operate withinsuch rules or it cannot be what it claims to be.This also means to allow others to be spontaneous without imposing rules uponthem. If you are obsessed with, or intimidated by, rules the Matrix has you. Thepeople who say ‘rules is rules’, and enforce them without taking circumstancesinto account are spontaneity-free zones, carousel horses devoid of a rider. Theyoften become government officials, car-park attendants, traffic wardens,security staff, police officers and many others with a rule-book reality thatdictates their every thought. They are like speed cameras in uniform, unable tofigure out that not every situation should be treated the same. This is thereptilian brain at work again. I had a guy press the doorbell one time who hadcome to do a routine five-minute inspection of the flat I was renting. Hisagency had done this every few months for years on behalf of the owners. He onlyhad to walk a very short distance from his office, but when I said Pam was illin bed and could he come back another day, he insisted that if he couldn’t comein I would be charged a £30 fee. He said that this was the day he told us he wascoming and there could be no exceptions in his programmed mind. When I observesuch people I can see their circuit board being read and the RNA pressing‘enter’. They are computers.Have you ever seen a computer being spontaneous unless its system is buggered?When you click on ‘Google’ that is where the computer takes you. It follows therulebook. It doesn’t say, ‘sod that, I’m off to AOL, tough shit’. It acts like acomputer program because that is what it is and it’s the same with the‘rulebookers’ in uniform, the Windows 95s. Spontaneity overrides the programbecause it is an expression of consciousness – Infinite Love. When a computergoes haywire and refuses to follow instructions it could be symbolicallyperceived as mentally ill and programmed people can see spontaneous behaviour inthe same way. They don’t understand it because it doesn’t fit with the programthat controls them. There is a great line in one of the Matrix movies where theMerovingian character says: ‘It is remarkable how similar the pattern of love isto the pattern of insanity’. So it is, at least as perceived. Love in its truesense is All Possibility and that can be seen as crazy to programmed limitation.All this is not to say that we should go so far as spontaneously jumping fromthe Eiffel Tower. It is possible to do that and be okay because everything is anillusory reality, but we will only survive such ‘miracles’ when we are sodisconnected from the program that our reality is no longer subject to its basic‘rules’ like gravity. This was well illustrated in the first Matrix movie whenMorpheus was able to leap between the buildings in the computer program whileNeo fell on his face. One was free of the Illusion at a deep level, the otherwas not. To perform such apparent miracles we have a lot more deprogramming todo, to say the least, but we can make an immediate start by ceasing to beimprisoned by rules that won’t give us the illusion of death if we don’t conformto them. There are other ways to jump from the tower without doing it‘physically’. You can jump from a job you can’t stand and pursue your dreamwithout fear of losing your ‘security’. You can do what you feel is rightwithout letting fear of the consequences stop you. You can cease to allow thefear of what other people think decide your experience. All these are examplesof consciousness disconnecting from mind and emotions and overriding theprogram. The ‘world’ you are afraid of only exists in your head and you canchange it any time you want by changing your sense of reality. You are InfinitePossibility and you can manifest anything if you don’t let the ‘I can’t’ programcontrol you.I have been saying in my books that we need to think for ourselves and that isthe start of the process that leads to infinite freedom. It is, however, onlythe start. The next stage is to stop thinking at all. But that’s crazy, Dave.How can we live without thinking? In fact, we can’t truly live if we do.Thinking comes from ‘mind’ and mind is the program. Mind thinks, consciousnessknows. I can only go so far with this while using language because it issomething people have to experience to fully understand. Everything I have saidin this book has been subject to the same limitation of the language availableand there is far more to know than I have been able to portray in words, and farmore that I have yet to access. It is the same with the chasm of differencebetween thinking and knowing. I would put it this way: if you have to thinkabout something, it’s the Matrix. ‘Now let me think’ …, ‘I’ll think about it’ …,‘Hold on, I’m thinking’ …, are all the program at work. When consciousnessoverrides the software we just know. If you seek answers, the Matrix has you.By seeking answers you must be asking questions and therefore you are notoperating as Oneness – the All-Knowing. When you access that level of awareness,there is an answer to everything, so long as you don’t ask the question. Or,looking from another angle, there are no answers because there are no questions.There is only knowing because we are accessing the All-Knowing Infinite One(Figure 85, overleaf). When faced with a situation, you don’t think about whatto do, you know. When trying to understand how things are, you don’t think andtry to work it out, you know. When you are connecting in awareness with theAll-Knowing, how can you not know? To achieve this state of knowing does notrequire us to learn anything or go anywhere. We have nothing to learn and we areeverywhere.‘I’d like a ticket to everywhere, please.’‘Sorry, sir, you can’t go because you’ve already arrived.’We don’t need to learn, we need to unlearn what the program has manipulated usto believe. Mind is not the road to enlightenment; it is the barrier to it.Knowledge and knowing is not the same thing – one is mind, the otherconsciousness. We don’t need to learn, but to awaken from the hypnotic tranceand remember who we are. When we do, we cease to think and start to know. Somecall this intuition or ‘following the heart’ and it comes from a far more awarelevel of consciousness than is usually at large in this reality. Knowing is thedecision-making arm of spontaneity. The program seeks to suppress this by usingmind and emotion to pressure us to consider the consequences of intuitivedecisions, feel guilty for doing things that knowing urges us to do, andquestion how ‘little me’ could possibly know anyway. This reluctance to acceptthe magnitude and infinity of who we are is the biggest block to reaching astate of knowing. We have intuitive knowing and then immediately begin to doubtit. That is the program kicking in to protect its control. One of the phrasesyou hear is: ‘You have a lot to learn’. But we don’t. We only think we do. Toaccept that we have to learn is to accept we are not All-Knowing, and to acceptthis means to accept we are not Oneness. How can the All think small? Only whenthe Matrix has you.image [../Images/00090.jpg]Figure 85: When we open ourselves to the Infinite Consciousness that we are, webegin to see through the illusion and the Matrix loses its control of our senseof reality. Those still caught in the illusion see such people as mad, dangerousor extremeVital to ditching ‘Little Me’ is to replace self-loathing with self-love. Thesystem wants you to feel bad about yourself, to be consumed by guilt and regret,and to see yourself as insignificant, a loser in the game of life. It lays downblueprints for what is a ‘success’ or ‘failure’, a ‘good parent’, ‘goodhusband’, ‘good wife’, ‘good this’, or ‘good that’. And it wags its finger ifyou don’t measure up. If you accept the system’s version of reality it holds youin a low vibrational emotional state where the Matrix makes the rules. Religionhas done a magnificent job of making people loath themselves. The sinnermentality is in the DNA programming and affects even those who reject thereligions that put it there. But we can disconnect from this genetic self-abuse.You are not your mind or emotions, your ‘personality’; you are Infinite Love.That doesn’t mean Infinite Love for everything except ‘you’. How can youreconnect with Infinite Love while you consciously or subconsciously despiseyourself?? What you have done or not done, said or not said, is irrelevant. Youwere caught in the program while thinking it was you. Now you can drop thedisguise and love what you really are – Love. And why can’t you love yourprogrammed ‘personality’, too? After all, that is also Infinite Love; it’s justthat it doesn’t know. Love and forgiveness for self and others, including theprogrammed manipulators, deletes the software that stimulates the guilt andhatred which holds us in illusory separation.Once you realise that the world is illusion and the body is a software programmanipulated to ensnare consciousness, you can play with reality and have funwith it. I have been asked many times if it is possible to make money or followthis or that career without being caught in the game. Yes it is, so long as youknow it’s a game and not real – although once you access consciousness thiswhole ‘career’ obsession is seen in a different light. I am not telling peoplethey should sit on a mountain top and ponder every day on the nature of Oneness.Illusions control us when we think they’re real, and to know it’s an illusion isto breach that control. As I showed with the subliminal advertisements in Talesfrom the Time Loop, once you can see the manipulation it ceases to have power.When you look at a subliminal message in a picture it can talk to yoursubconscious without you being aware of its existence. But when the hiddenmessage is pointed out you see it clearly every time you look. The illusion islike that. Once you are aware of the game, it loses its control. If people wantto pursue a career and make lots of non-existent money, go ahead. But theyshould know that it doesn’t matter if they do and it doesn’t matter if theydon’t because both are illusion.I’ll give you an example of what I mean about playing with the game and beingtrapped by it. Sport is a major global entertainment and that’s fine so long aswe don’t believe it matters. I love watching football, what Americans callsoccer, and coaching my young son, Jaymie, who is a brilliant goalkeeper. I havea few teams I like to see win, but if they don’t, so what? I know it’s illusion,albeit to me an entertaining one. Jaymie would like to become a professionalfootballer, but if he does or he doesn’t he will not have succeeded or failed –both are holographic illusions and he’ll be Infinite Oneness either way. If youthink in terms of success and failure the Matrix has you. However, football, andother sports, can be experienced very differently when you think the illusion isreal. How the team they support is doing becomes everything to some fans andaffects their whole life. They go into anger or depression when the team losesand the hatred between many supporters of rival teams is extraordinary to me.They live their lives through their football club and their own sense of successand failure is measured by how well the team is doing. The Matrix has thembecause they believe it’s real and the outcome matters. It is yet anotherillusion within the illusion; another subplot; a hologram within thesuper-hologram.This attitude to sport mirrors the way the I Am Human Program views life ingeneral. Attachments chain us to the Matrix: attachment to people, status, race,nation, religion, money and, the biggest of them all, attachment to outcome.Nothing suffocates freedom and peace more than this. If, like sports fans, youattach yourself to ‘your team’ winning, you are setting yourself up fordisappointment because the only way to avoid that is for ‘your team’ to win. Anyother outcome guarantees disappointment and frustration. But if you enjoy thegame without attachment to the result, the outcome will not produce emotionalupset and trauma because you weren’t attached to a specific scenario. You mayhave preferred a certain outcome, but you were not attached to it emotionally.Once again, it is the same with ‘life’.What keeps us in the illusion more than anything is our identification withpolarity. The Matrix depends for its very existence on the duality that dividesOneness, at least in our sense of reality, and creates the poles between whichthe world of vibration can resonate. This can be seen in DNA with its twostrands and in the two halves of the brain. Everywhere you see the polarities oflight and dark, negative and positive, left and right, male and female, rightand wrong, good and bad, for and against. This entire reality is based onpolarity. When we accept this as real, and who we are, we disconnect from theconsciousness of the One in awareness of itself. There are no polarities inOneness and so no vibration. There is only one One and it has nothing with whichto resonate. If you identify with a polarity – I am a man, woman, British,American, on the Left or Right and all the rest – the Matrix has you.Infinite Consciousness observing through a female hologram does not make you awoman. It is the program that does that. You can identify with being InfiniteConsciousness having an experience without falling for the trap that you areyour body or your experience. To the Matrix, women fighting for their rights isjust as important as men seeking to deny them because it creates polarities. TheLeft in politics is as vital as the Right for the same reason, and so on. If weidentify with a polarity we create the other. A belief in the ‘Light’ means thatyou must believe in the ‘Dark’ or you would not have to call it ‘Light’. Itwould just be, no label necessary. If you believe in the positive you mustcreate the illusion of the negative or you would not have to use the word‘positive’. It would just be, no label necessary. A belief in God creates thepolarity of the Devil. There is no God and there is no Devil because these areillusions of mind. But if you believe in, and identify with, either of them youcreate the other. When you fight the darkness you create it by believing in it.Many New Agers have told me over the years that I have to protect myself fromdark forces and this usually involves some ritual or other, or asking the‘Light’ for help. This is such bollocks. Why do I need to protect myself from anillusion? By believing that I have to defend against attacks from the ‘Dark’, Iam creating the Dark in my illusory reality and giving it power over me. I amtelling the RNA to read ‘physical’ reality in that way.What you fight you become, as we can see with the way apparently opposing groupsreplicate the attitudes, behaviour and methods of the other. The resonancebetween them feeds both ‘sides’ the same blueprint. They are different poles,but the same resonance. This is why apparently ‘opposite’ extremes have the samereactions, attitudes and methods. The polarities are behind the so-called ‘law’of cause and effect, which is nothing more than the ‘law’ of reaction. It is nota ‘law’, it is a program. When the Matrix and its Illuminati software instigatesomething like a war, or anything else contentious, they know the reaction willcreate a polarity – in this case anti-war – and the emotions involved aretrawled as an energy source. It is Problem-Reaction-Absorption. Multi-millionsof genuine people who want to stop war and injustice have been caught by theMatrix through the illusion of fighting for something. To fight for freedom isto resonate with its pole, fighting to suppress; and fighting in any form is alow-vibrational state. I love the one about fighting for peace. What staggeringself-delusion that is. Doing what you know to do should not be confused withfighting for what you believe to be right. It is a totally different state ofawareness that does not identify with being on a ‘side’ and so does not involvepolarity. It just is. Reaction is the force behind the desire for revenge andnothing creates polarity more effectively than that. They say don’t get mad, geteven, but what we really need to do is get conscious.This brings me to something that I know most people will find extremelydifficult to comprehend and again there are not the words to fully communicatewhat I mean. If you thought ‘stop thinking’ was weird enough, get this. To trulyconnect in awareness with the One, we need to stop making choices, stop tryingto change anything and have no sense of purpose. What? I know, but hear me out.Firstly, this does not mean sitting in a cross-legged position staring at thewall forever more. It is not that experiences don’t happen in your life, it iswhat makes them happen and the state of being from which they happen. Once morethis is something we have to know, not mentally understand, but I’ll do my bestwith the words available. There are a number of lines in the Matrix movies thatspeak about ‘purpose’. One guy says: ‘Every program that is created must have apurpose. If it does not it is deleted’. And the Agent Smith character, acomputer program, observed:> ‘Without purpose we would not exist. It is purpose that created us, purpose> that connects us, purpose that pulls us, that guides us, that drives us. It is> purpose that defines us, purpose that binds us.’ He might have added: ‘It is purpose that controls us’. I am going to state theobvious, but sometimes that is necessary because we miss it: to be InfinitePossibility we need to be Infinite Possibility. We cannot be InfinitePossibility by being anything less than that. To identify with a singlepossibility is not to encompass all into Oneness. When we have a purpose we arenot in connection with the One because the One does not have purpose, it justis. Another of writer Oscar Wilde’s famous quotes was: ‘Ambition is the lastrefuge of the failure’. Ambition is a state of purpose and wanting, not being.My dictionary says that purpose is ‘an anticipated outcome that is intended orthat guides your planned actions’. Exactly, it is association with outcome, notInfinite Possibility. Purpose is a program of the Matrix because, as Agent Smithsaid, it defines us. And it defines us as a part not a whole. When what you arecan be defined the Matrix has you because Oneness – Isness – is indefinable.When you have a purpose to do something, that is what you become. You aredefined by self and people as a politician, lawyer, judge, stockbroker orwhatever. To be without purpose does not mean to sit down and do nothing; it isto cease to identify who you are with what you are doing and no longer let whatyou do define you. What you do just is instead of what you are.When I started my journey to expose the conspiracy I had a purpose and itdefined me. I was a seeker of truth who wanted to alert people to what washappening. I was doing what I did for a purpose. Not anymore. I have no purposein what I do and it is a completely different state of being that has to beexperienced to be understood. I did not write this book with the purpose ofalerting people, changing people or changing anything. I just wrote it. Thewords just are, the book just is. Within ‘is’ lies purpose and no purpose – theOne. When we make choices through mind or emotion we are pursuing purpose. I didnot choose to write this book. There was no point when I made the choice tostart writing – it just happened, no choice necessary. When we make a choiceabout anything we are using mind or emotion and creating a polarity with otherpossible choices. What we call ‘guilt’ is the resonance between choices made andchoices that could have been made. When you don’t make choices there are nopolarities. To choose is to select and we do this by thinking, which is theprogram. When we are in a state of knowing there are no choices to make becausewe are not faced with alternatives. Knowing knows, it does not have to selectfrom options.When we set out to change something we create a polarity with the status quo andempower the control system. I hear that everything is always in a state ofchange and that without change – movement – nothing could exist. To quote AgentSmith again: ‘Without purpose we would not exist’. That’s what the program wantsus to believe. The trinity of purpose-choice-change is the Matrix. It is therealm of doingness, not isness. The One does not change in the sense that it isalways One, always Infinite Possibility. Therefore, purpose, choice and changecan only manifest in a state of illusory disconnection that identifies withform, limitation and time. Purpose implies to move into the future; but there isno future, it’s an illusion. To make choices is to identify with personality,not infinity. To seek change is to identify with the movie, the illusion, notthe unchanging One. And what we identify with we give power to.Okay, I can hear the question and I understand it. If we don’t pursue purpose,choice and change, does that mean we just sit around and do nothing while theIlluminati impose terror, control and mayhem? Well, yes and no. It is not aboutdoing, but being. To do is to make a choice to do. It is a process of thoughtand that is the program, the Matrix, creating polarities. To be is to know – theOne. The pursuit of purpose and doing gets in the way of that. Oneness is thebalance of all, and the Illuminati agenda is not balance, but polarities. Tochallenge the Illuminati is not balance, but polarity. To be is to encompassthem both and identify with neither. When we come from the perspective ofOneness and move with the flow of knowingness, things just happen without usneeding to choose, think, fight or pursue. We might appear to do, in the sensethat I have done something by writing this book. But it is really amanifestation of beingness because I did not set out with the mindset of doinganything for the purpose of change. I know it is difficult to get this over withlanguage, but when you drop into this mode of knowing and being it makes perfectsense in a way that words cannot deliver.The road to freedom and Oneness is not to create polarities, but to encompassthem. When people ask me how I describe myself, I say: I am and I’m not; I’meverything and nothing; I’m everywhere and nowhere; I am all possibility andnone. This sounds ridiculous in a world imprisoned by identification withpolarity. How can I be all these ‘opposites’? Surely I must be one or the other?But if I am a polarity, how can I be the One? In science they talk about matterand antimatter, negative and positive polarities in the realm of particles. Whena particle and its antiparticle meet they ‘annihilate’ each other and theirentire mass is converted into pure energy. The power produced by this fusion ofpoles is simply fantastic. The polarities with which we identify are similar inprinciple to matter and antimatter and we can bring about this ‘annihilation’into Oneness only by bringing them together. Instead of identifying with one, wecan be both and fuse them into balance. You identify with the whole, not theillusory parts. You are and you’re not; you are everywhere and nowhere;everything and nothing; negative and positive; you can and you can’t; you willand you won’t; you are for and against; you believe and you don’t. By being bothyou ‘annihilate’ both and what’s left is Oneness. As we do this we dismantle thepower of the Matrix that depends on polarity.We are in the midst of a collective transformation, at least at this level ofperception, although I don’t believe it’s the one the New Age and others talkabout. I would suggest there are actually two ‘transformations’ and one is afake designed to mislead us. The year 2012 would appear very significant to theIlluminati and this is also the point at which the Mayan Calendar says therewill be a transformation to a new world. The ancient Mayans, in what is nowCentral America, developed their own measurement of time and observed repeatingcycles that they detailed in the calendar. They said that a Great Cycle began onAugust 11th, 3114BC and would end on the winter solstice, December 21st, 2012,the point when a ‘Great, Great Cycle’ of 26,000 years would also come to aconclusion. It relates to the New Age belief about moving from the astrologicalAge of Pisces to the ‘enlightened’ Age of Aquarius. This is the moment when newcycles will begin, it is said, and humanity will be infused with love and light.A Mayan Calendar website summarised this basic theme:> ‘There is no reason not to take a leap of faith into imagining what may be in> store. We may trust that it is time for humanity to awaken into a true> partnership with each other, with the earth, and the Cosmos. By accepting this> partnership we may claim our birthright and become Galactic Citizens who care> for and sustain the planet, thus sustaining ourselves. This is clearly the> challenge of our times. Yet, arriving just in time and on schedule is the> Winter Solstice dawn on the day we may remember that we are truly Children of> the World.’ At the risk of upsetting many in the New Age, I say this is the faketransformation. I have no problem with the fact that 2012 is significant in TimeLoop terms, nor that the Mayans clearly had a remarkable grasp on the planetaryand cosmic cycles they related to time. I just say they were measuring thecomputer program, the cosmic planetarium, and that the predicted transformationis as illusory as the rest of this holographic reality. It is another part ofthe DVD, another diversionary subplot. There is no time, and anything thatidentifies with it is not a transformation to Oneness. We are not ‘trulyChildren of the World’, we are truly Infinite Consciousness. Identifying selfwith the ‘world’ is identifying with the Matrix. It is a belief system thatstill relates to form, with being ‘human’, ‘Galactic Citizens’, and sustaining aholographic illusion we call ‘earth’. Millions are caught by the Matrix in thefake transformation. The Mayan Calendar is one example and so is Ashtar Command.I attended an event in London in which members of a remaining tribe of Incastold of coming upheavals and change. They lived high in the Andes Mountains ofPeru where their people had remained isolated from the rest of society until, astheir legends foretold 500 years earlier, a series of signs appeared that toldthem the transformation of humanity had arrived. The legends said that when theysaw the signs they should come down from the mountains and tell the world thatthe next ‘Pachacuti’ had begun. Pacha means ‘earth’ or ‘time’, and Cuti means‘to turn upside-down’. This is a common theme and, again, I am sure the upheavaland chaos they predict (including major geological events) is designed by theMatrix to happen, as in fact it already is. But I still say the 2012 scenario isa change in the program, not truly a transformation to Oneness in awareness ofitself. The latter is nothing to do with an Age of Aquarius, which is justanother scene on the DVD.image [../Images/00091.jpg]image [../Images/00092.jpg]Figures 86 and 87: As the energy of Oneness pervades the Matrix, the fearvibration dissolves and the reality of its captive consciousness is transformedThere is something else going on that does not relate to programmed astrologicalmovements or cycles of time. It is a transformation emitting from a level ofawareness in which illusions like cosmic cycles are irrelevant. To continue thecomputer analogy, Oneness is hacking into the system. Synchronicity orcoordinated ‘coincidence’ can have many causes. It can be the Matrix program; itcan be consciousness caught in the cause and effect illusion we call the cycleof reincarnation and karma; and it can be reconnecting in awareness – knowing –with the One, All That Is, and being drawn to similar states of consciousness.The synchronicity of knowing frees you from the synchronicity of the program.The trick is knowing which is which. It is reconnecting with Oneness thatcarries the energy of true transformation and anyone can do this by ceasing toidentify with the illusion and being the One that they are. The Matrix‘transformation’ and the Oneness transformation are running together and the wayto tell them apart is their effect. Does a change or event bring love orconflict? Balance or imbalance? Justice or injustice? Does it further divide orbring together? Does it imprison or does it set free? The Matrix transformationis about changing the game; the Oneness transformation is about ending the gameas we have come to know it (Figures 86 and 87).Energy follows sense of reality and when you know you are the One, and expressthat knowing, you become the essence of the One. That’s all we need to do totransform from limitation to All Possibility. The balance of Oneness strips awayimbalanced thought and emotion and excites the particles of the holographicrealm to vibrate ever faster until there is no vibration at all. It will balancethe body holograms of those that connect with it, restore them to health and endthe ageing process that sees so many play out their physical lives in pain andinfirmity. As we are transformed from fear to love, so we send that energy tothe Matrix central computer and rewrite its program. From there it istransmitted back to all holograms within the super-hologram and those programsare also rewritten in the language of love. The balance of Oneness will alsoheal the gaps in the fabric of our collective reality called interspaces. Theyare a symptom of fragmentation and cannot exist within unity. With that, and themassively increased potential to see beyond the veil of ‘visible light’, so muchthat has remained hidden comes into conscious view. As the frequency rises, soour relationship to illusory ‘time’ changes and those flowing with thetransformation experience ‘time’ as passing ever faster. Oneness has always beenthere, but now it is being felt again and, for those who are freeing themselvesfrom the program, home is calling.We have been caught in a dreamworld that we have believed to be real. Thisincludes those other dimensions of the illusion between which the captiveconsciousness of the Matrix ‘reincarnates’ from one program to another. The wayhome is to know we are already home and always have been. It is to stopidentifying who we are with form, the need to ‘evolve’, to learn from endlessreincarnated experience, and being subordinate to the will of some ‘God’. Theyare all strands in the web of control, subplots in the movie. Instead we canknow we are Oneness and see this illusion for what it is, a silly game createdby our own fear.If you live your life knowing you are the One, your entire perspective istransformed (Figure 88). What seemed important or fearful becomes the focus forhysterical laughter. When you look at the world from the perspective of beingthe One, all those things that annoy you or make you frustrated, depressed andin fear are seen to be the irrelevance that they are. It is worth asking whenthese situations arise: how would the One view this? Would the One care less ifsomeone said ‘fuck’? Would the One condemn sexual preference? Would the One getangry because a sports team didn’t win? Would the One go to a voting booth orsupport a political party? Would the One follow a religion or contemplate thepotential perils of a Cheese Danish? Would the One have to protect itself froman illusory ‘Darkness’? Would the One worry about its astrology or karma or whatit was in a previous life? Would the One feel the need to succeed or ‘be’someone? Would the One go to war or fight for peace? Would the One worry aboutanything, regret the ‘past’ or fear the ‘future’? Would the One be frightened of‘death’ when it doesn’t exist? No to all of them because they are illusions. Sowhy do we do these things when we are the One? The only difference is betweenOneness in awareness of itself and Oneness that has forgotten what it is.image [../Images/00093.jpg]Figure 88: Transformation from division to Oneness is open to everyone. Thereare no ‘chosen people’, only Infinite LoveWe act small because we believe small; and we believe what we are programmed tobelieve. It doesn’t have to be like this. We can let our consciousness sing andknow we are All That Is. We have been living a false identity, an alias thatisn’t who we are. But we can look in the illusory mirror and re-evaluate what wethink we see. We are not our name, body, family, race, nation or religion. Weare not our possessions, job, status, fame, success or failure. We are not evenour personality, thoughts or emotions.So what are we?We are Infinite Love.How do I know?Simple.There is nothing else."},{"pageContent":"Appendix I Human DNA is a Biological Internet, Say Russian Scientists After I had completed this book and it had entered the production stage, I sawan article on the Internet about the findings of Russian scientists with regardto DNA. I was delighted to see that their discoveries supported the main themesof this book and here is a summary of their work available at a number ofwebsites.The italicised emphasis and comments are mine:The human DNA is a biological Internet and superior in many aspects to theartificial one. The latest Russian scientific research directly, or indirectly,explains phenomena such as clairvoyance, intuition, spontaneous and remote actsof healing, self healing, affirmation techniques, unusual light-auras aroundpeople (namely ‘spiritual masters’), mind’s influence on weather-patterns andmuch more. In addition, there is evidence for a whole new type of medicine inwhich DNA can be influenced and reprogrammed by words and frequencies withoutcutting out and replacing single genes [as I suggested in chapter five[../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos301380] and in previous books].Only ten per cent of our DNA is being used for building proteins [many say 3% to5%]. It is this subset of DNA that is of interest to western researchers and isbeing examined and categorized. The other 90% are considered ‘junk DNA’. TheRussian researchers, however, convinced that nature was not dumb, joinedlinguists and geneticists in a venture to explore those 90% of ‘junk DNA’. Theirresults, findings and conclusions are simply revolutionary! According to them,our DNA is not only responsible for the construction of our body, but alsoserves as data storage and in communication. DNA is an organic superconductorthat can work at normal body temperature, as opposed to artificialsuperconductors which require extremely low temperatures to function. Inaddition, all superconductors are able to store light and information. Thisfurther explains how DNA can store information.The Russian linguists found that the genetic code, especially in the apparentlyuseless 90%, follows the same rules as all our human languages. To this end theycompared the rules of syntax (the way in which words are put together to formphrases and sentences), semantics (the study of meaning in language forms) andthe basic rules of grammar. They found that the alkalines of our DNA follow aregular grammar and do have set rules just like our languages. So humanlanguages did not appear coincidentally but are a reflection of our inherent DNA[the program].The Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist, Pjotr Garjajev, and hiscolleagues, also explored the vibrational behaviour of the DNA. The bottom linewas: ‘Living chromosomes function just like solitonic-holographic computersusing the endogenous DNA laser radiation’. [Solitons are a special type of lightwave that doesn’t change shape as it travels.] This means that they managed, forexample, to modulate certain frequency patterns onto a laser ray, and used it toinfluence the DNA frequency and thus the genetic information itself. [Thisprocess is what we call ‘Evolution’, as I said earlier]. Since the basicstructure of DNA-alkaline pairs, and of language, are of the same structure, noDNA decoding is necessary. One can simply use words and sentences of the humanlanguage! This, too, was experimentally proven! [This phenomenon is captured inthe water crystal images of Masaru Emoto formed by words and frequencies.]Living DNA substance will always react to language-modulated laser rays, andeven to radio waves, if the proper frequencies are being used. This finally andscientifically explains why affirmations, autogenous training, hypnosis and thelike can have such strong effects on humans and their bodies. It is entirelynormal and natural for our DNA to react to language. [It is a computer programthat can be rewritten by this data input]. While western researchers cut singlegenes from the DNA strands and insert them elsewhere, the Russiansenthusiastically worked on devices that can influence the cellular metabolismthrough suitably modulated radio and light frequencies and thus repair geneticdefects.Garjajev’s research group succeeded in proving with this method that chromosomesdamaged by x-rays can be repaired. They even captured information patterns of aparticular DNA and transmitted it onto another, so reprogramming cells toanother genome. They successfully transformed, for example, frog embryos tosalamander embryos simply by transmitting the DNA information patterns! [Inothers words, they rewrote the program and changed – shapeshifted! – thewaveform/hologram.] This way the entire information was transmitted without anyof the side effects or disharmonies encountered when cutting out andreintroducing single genes from the DNA. This represents an unbelievable,world-transforming revolution and sensation! All this by simply applyingvibration and language instead of the archaic cutting-out procedure! Thisexperiment points to the immense power of wave genetics, which obviously has agreater influence on the formation of organisms than the biochemical processesof alkaline sequences [in fact, one is an expression of the other].Esoteric and spiritual teachers have known for ages that our body isprogrammable by language, words and thought. This has now been scientificallyproven and explained. Of course, the frequency has to be correct, and this iswhy not everybody is equally successful or can do it with always the samestrength. The individual must work on the inner processes and maturity in orderto establish a conscious communication with the DNA [consciousness can rewritethe program, as I have emphasised throughout the book]. The Russian researcherswork on a method that is not dependent on these factors but will always work,provided one uses the correct frequency.But the higher developed an individual’s consciousness, the less need is therefor any type of device! One can achieve these results by oneself, and sciencewill finally stop laughing at such ideas and will confirm and explain theresults. Modern man knows this only on a much more subtle level, as ‘intuition’[knowing!]. But we, too, can regain full use of it. An example from Nature: Whena queen ant is spatially separated from her colony, building still continuesfervently and according to plan. If the queen is killed, however, all work inthe colony stops. No ant knows what to do. Apparently the queen sends the‘building plans’ from far away via the group consciousness of her subjects. Shecan be as far away as she wants, as long as she is alive. [The Queen ant is likethe Matrix ‘brain’.]In man, ‘hypercommunication’ [communication at levels beyond the five-senserealm] is most often encountered when one suddenly gains access to informationthat is outside one’s knowledge base. Such ‘hypercommunication’ is thenexperienced as inspiration or intuition [knowing]. The Italian composer,Giuseppe Tartini dreamt one night that a devil sat at his bedside playing theviolin. The next morning Tartini was able to note down the piece exactly frommemory; he called it the Devil’s Trill Sonata. For years, a 42-year old malenurse dreamt of a situation in which he was hooked up to a kind of knowledgeCD-ROM. Verifiable knowledge from all imaginable fields was then transmitted tohim that he was able to recall in the morning. There was such a flood ofinformation that it seemed a whole encyclopaedia was transmitted at night. Themajority of facts were outside his personal knowledge base and reached technicaldetails about which he knew absolutely nothing. [This is like a computerdownload. A computer does not have to know anything about the information itrecords.]When hypercommunication occurs, one can observe special phenomena in the DNA, aswell as in the human being. The Russian scientists irradiated DNA samples withlaser light. On screen, a typical wave pattern was formed. When they removed theDNA sample, the wave pattern did not disappear, it remained. Many controlexperiments showed that the pattern still came from the removed sample, whoseenergy field apparently remained by itself. This effect is now called phantomDNA effect. The phenomenon encountered most often in hypercommunication isinexplicable electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the people concerned.Electronic devices like CD players and the like can be irritated and cease tofunction for hours. When the electromagnetic field slowly dissipates, thedevices function normally again. Many healers and psychics know this effect fromtheir work. The better the atmosphere and the energy, the more frustrating it isthat the recording device stops functioning and recording exactly at that moment[I have experienced this many times]. Repeated switching on and off after thesession does not restore function, but next morning all is back to normal.Perhaps this is reassuring to read for many, as it has nothing to do with thembeing technically inept; it means they are good at hypercommunication.[Remember the story of my experience in Brazil during the ayahuasca session whenthe lights came on without electricity and the music player went off and on.]The Russian scientists also found that our DNA can cause disturbing patterns ina vacuum, thus producing magnetized wormholes! Wormholes are microscopicequivalents of the so-called Einstein-Rosen bridges in the vicinity of blackholes (left by burned-out stars).These are tunnel connections between entirely different areas in the universe,through which information can be transmitted outside of space and time. The DNAattracts these bits of information and passes them on to our ‘consciousness’[what I call ‘mind’ and ‘emotion’ – the DNA network]. This process ofhypercommunication (telepathy, channelling, [knowing]) is most effective in astate of relaxation. Stress, worry or a hyperactive intellect prevent successfulhypercommunication or the information will be totally distorted and useless.[This is another reason why the system is designed to keep us in a state ofstress, worry and constant mental/emotional activity. It is also why left brain‘intellectuals’ that dominate ‘education’ and ‘science’ cannot access the levelof intuitive knowing that would expose their flawed and rigid beliefs.]There is another phenomenon linked to DNA and wormholes. Normally, thesesuper-small wormholes are highly unstable and are maintained only for thetiniest fractions of a second. Under certain conditions stable wormholes canorganize themselves, which then form distinctive vacuum domains in which, forexample, gravity can transform into electricity. Vacuum domains are self-radiantballs of ionized gas that contain considerable amounts of energy. There areregions in Russia where such radiant balls appear very often and it was thisthat motivated research programs that led to some of the discoveries detailedhere.Many ‘spiritual teachers’ also produce such visible balls or columns of light indeep meditation or during energy work, and in certain Earth healing projectssuch light effects also appear on photographs. Simply put, this phenomenon hasto do with gravity and anti-gravity forces that are ever more stable forms ofwormholes, and displays of hypercommunication with energies from outside ourtime and space structure [the Time Loop]. Earlier generations that experiencedsuch hypercommunication and visible vacuum domains were convinced that an angelhad appeared before them and we cannot be sure what forms of consciousness wecan get access when using hypercommunication. We have made another giant steptowards understanding our reality. Official science also knows of gravityanomalies on Earth that contribute to the formation of vacuum domains. Recentlygravity anomalies have been found in Rocca di Papa, south of Rome.In their book Vernetzte Intelligenz (Networked Intelligence), Grazyna Fosar andFranz Bludorf explain these connections precisely and clearly. The authors alsoquote sources who believe that in earlier times humanity was once, just like theanimals, very strongly connected to the group consciousness and acted as agroup. To develop and experience individuality, we humans had to forgethypercommunication almost completely [I would say that it was deliberatelysuppressed]. Now that we are fairly stable in our individual consciousness, wecan create a new form of group consciousness, namely one in which we attainaccess to all information via our DNA, without being forced or remotelycontrolled about what to do with that information. We now know that, just as onthe Internet, our DNA can feed its proper data into the network; can call updata from the network; and can establish contact with other participants in thenetwork [exactly as this book describes]. Remote healing, telepathy or ‘remotesensing’ [intuitive knowing] can thus be explained. Some animals know also fromafar when their owners plan to return home. That can be freshly interpreted andexplained via the concepts of group consciousness and hypercommunication [theDNA network].Any collective consciousness cannot be sensibly used over any period of timewithout a distinctive individuality. Otherwise, we would revert to a primitiveherd instinct that is easily manipulated [the Illuminati agenda for the humanrace today]. Hypercommunication in the new millennium means something quitedifferent. Researchers think that if humans with full individuality would regaingroup consciousness, they would have a god-like power to create, alter and shapethings on Earth! And humanity is collectively moving toward such a groupconsciousness of the new kind. Fifty per cent of today’s children will be‘problem’ children as soon as they go to school. The system lumps everyonetogether and demands adjustment. But the individuality of today’s children is sostrong that that they refuse this adjustment and resist giving up theiridiosyncrasies in the most diverse ways [Well, many do but vast numbers do not].At the same time, more and more clairvoyant children are born. Something inthose children is striving towards the group consciousness of the new kind, andit will no longer be suppressed.As a rule, weather is rather difficult to influence by a single individual. Butit may be influenced by a group consciousness (nothing new to some tribes doingit in their rain dances). Weather is strongly influenced by Earth resonancefrequencies, the so-called Schumann frequencies [a sort of planetary heartbeat].But those same frequencies are also produced in our brains, and when many peoplesynchronise their thinking, or individuals (‘spiritual masters’, for instance),focus their thoughts in a laser-like fashion, then it is, scientificallyspeaking, not at all surprising if they can thus influence weather. [TheIlluminati are manipulating the weather and geological activity using technologyand the vibrational principle is the same.]Researchers in group consciousness have formulated the theory of Type Icivilisations. A humanity that developed a group consciousness of this new kindwould have neither environmental problems, nor scarcity of energy. [How can youhave scarcity within Infinite abundance? Only if you believe in it.] For, ifhumanity were to use its mental power as a unified civilisation, it would havecontrol of the energies of its home planet as a natural consequence [it wouldrewrite the program]. And that includes all natural catastrophes! A theoreticalType II civilisation would even be able to control all energies of their homegalaxy. Whenever a great many people focus their attention or consciousness onsomething similar, like Christmas time, a football world championship or thefuneral of Lady Diana in England, certain random number generators in computersstart to deliver ordered numbers instead of the random ones. An ordered groupconsciousness creates order in its whole surroundings!> All information is from the book Vernetzte Intelligenz by Grazyna Fosar and> Franz Bludorf, ISBN 3930243237.

When itawakened to itself in this ‘disconnected’ state, it forgot that it was part ofthe infinite ocean and felt isolated and separated image [../Images/00102.jpg]… Separation led to the manifestation of fear (the winged entity) that took on alife of its own; consciousness was caught in an illusion it believed to be‘real’. Self-aware fear became the Frankenstein that controlled its creator bymanipulating reality through the illusion of form, ‘time’, and a sense ofseparation image [../Images/00103.jpg]One aspect of the Matrix control is through Reptilian and other softwareentities vibrating outside the frequency of ‘visible light’. They ‘possess’ theIlluminati bloodlines – and others – and dictate their actions in ‘our’ world image [../Images/00104.jpg]The ‘Red Dress’ bloodlines of the Illuminati that dominate royalty, politics,banking, business and media. They obsessively interbreed to stop the softwareprogram being rewritten by the infusion of consciousness image [../Images/00105.jpg]The two-faced (and then some) Illuminati manipulating human society under thecontrol of the Matrix program image [../Images/00106.jpg]image [../Images/00107.jpg]image [../Images/00108.jpg]The Illuminati use their human software clones to run their system of control.This includes using techniques like Problem-Reaction-Solution and Hidden Handmanipulation to advance their agenda for an Orwellian global dictatorship image [../Images/00109.jpg]The three types of ‘human’: on the left is the pure software program, the horsewith no rider, which includes the ‘pure’ Illuminati bloodlines; the centre imagerepresents the majority of ‘humans’ who are self-aware consciousness, buttrapped in the illusion and dominated by the program; and on the right issymbolised the much smaller – but rapidly growing – number of people who areconnected in awareness to consciousness beyond the Matrix. For this reason theyperceive life and the world very differently to the rest and can be seen as‘crazy’ or ‘dangerous’ image [../Images/00110.jpg]The Matrix central computer or ‘brain’ communicates a collective reality tocomputer terminals/brains throughout the super-hologram. We decode these signalsinto an illusory 3-D reality image [../Images/00111.jpg]The eyes only tranform the tiny frequency range known as ‘visible light’ intoelectrical signals that are decoded by the brain/DNA network into a holographic‘3D’ reality. The ‘physical world’ we think is ‘around us’ only exists in ourheads! image [../Images/00112.jpg]Everything in our ‘physical’ reality is a hologram decoded from waveforms by thebrain/DNA/RNA. Animals, the Natural World and the ‘law of the wild’ are allholographic illusions – the Matrix program image [../Images/00113.jpg]The 95 per cent of ‘junk’ DNA, 95 per cent of brain activity not involved withthe waking state, and at least much of the enormous brain capacity that sciencesays we don’t use, are actually connecting us with the energy/matter in theuniverse that we can’t see – and also to realms beyond that.

Those still caught in the illusion once again see such people as mad,dangerous or extreme (see chapter ten[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos593748]) image [../Images/00117.jpg]As the energy of Oneness pervades the Matrix, the fear vibration dissolves andthe reality of its captive consciousness is transformed into Infinite unity (seechapter ten [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos593748]) image [../Images/00118.jpg]Transformation from division to Oneness is open to everyone.
