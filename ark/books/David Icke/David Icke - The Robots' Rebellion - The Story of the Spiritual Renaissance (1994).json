A scientist talking on television recently said the Big Question was ‘How was the Universe formed?’ But is it? Is that really the answer we must find above all others at a time of such trauma and confusion on this planet? I would say not. I think that how the Universe was formed is extremely interesting, but not something that it is essential to know in order to find the path that will lead us out of this mess. What we really need to know - the Big Question - is who we really are and what we are doing here in this period of fantastic change and transformation on Planet Earth. From that understanding, all the other answers will come - including how the Universe was formed. Without that appreciation of the true nature of life, we will go on being mesmerised by this physical world and largely controlled by its illusions and by those misguided forces, detailed in this book, which seek to turn us into little more than zombies. In other words, we will destroy ourselves. The irony is that the information already exists to tell us all we need to know, but the implications of this knowledge are so catastrophic for religion, establishment science, education (indoctrination) and the whole economic, political, industrial, and military system, that these answers have been suppressed. When suppression has not been possible, those who articulate the eternal understanding have been ridiculed, condemned and undermined in every way imaginable. We still refer to the Great Mysteries of Life, but they only remain ‘mysteries’ because of the consequences for the system of their solution. We are talking here of the most monumental con-trick in the history of the human race, a sleight of hand and mind that involves not only people, but other areas of the Universe too. It has been a piece of black magic so successful that it has programmed the minds of billions of people to forget who they are, where they came from, and what they are doing here today. I believe it is time for some straight talking. We are a race of robots. By that, I mean that most people do not have a thought in"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ix their heads that has not been put there by someone or something else. We have become a race of programmed minds which can be persuaded to believe and do almost anything as long as the drip, drip, drip of lies and misinformation continues to bombard us through our political systems, the media, religion, schools, universities, and by infiltration of our consciousness by other universal sources which want to turn Planet Earth into a zombies’ prison. But, slowly at first and now ever more quickly, the robots are awakening. Instead of meekly accepting a daily diet of mind control, more and more people are seeing the world in a new light and asking questions they have never asked before. The veil is lifting and the robots’ rebellion has arrived. In this book, I will tell the story of how we forgot our true identity and how the forces of control are preparing to enter the final phase of their plan to take over the planet and the human race. Humanity has been gripped by a spiritual amnesia which has taken us down a dark and dangerous path from which we are now in the process of escaping, or not, depending on the choices we make. Most of what you are about to read will not be new to you. You already know it. You have merely forgotten. You have a memory that retains some of what you have experienced in this physical lifetime, but humanity has lost contact with its higher memory; that part of us which knows the Big Answers to the Big Questions. This book will help you to restore the links with that memory and, once that begins to happen, as it has already begun for countless millions around the world today, you are never going to be the same again. Those who are moving along this road to rediscovery are the ones who are leading the robots’ rebellion. It is vital for the future of the human race for as many as possible to wake up and set out on that same journey. Only by triggering and expanding a reconnection with our higher levels of being will we have access to the information and love that we so desperately need in order to heal ourselves and, through that, to help to heal this beautiful planet we call Earth. We stand on the threshold of indescribable and incomprehensible change. We cannot know exactly what will unfold, because humans are affecting the detail with every passing minute, but we can be sure that nothing and no-one will be left untouched by what is happening on the planet. I believe these changes are the harbingers of a far, far, better world than the one we survey today. I think it was Voltaire who said: “Those who believe absurdities commit attrocities”.

Thay may sound fantastic to you at this stage, but read on and you will see that it is very real and affecting our lives every day. It is, however, a conspiracy that we can, and will, dismantle. At the heart of this attack on human freedom is the desire to keep from us the knowledge of the spiritual realities of our true selves and the understanding of our place in this wondrous web of life we call Creation. If you have heard the explanations about the eternal nature of consciousness and how we are all on an endless journey of evolution through experience, it is fine to move straight on to the first chapter. If such information is new to you it is worth reading the following short summary of the knowledge which the manipulators have, but which they don’t want to share with anyone else: The real us is not the physical body we see. That is the vehicle we inhabit for a single physical lifetime on this planet. The eternal us is our consciousness, our spirit, our mind. At that moment we mistakenly call ‘death’ our eternal mind - the thinking, feeling, us - leaves the body and moves on to continue its evolution elsewhere. This is what happens in a so-called ‘near death experience’. Thousands have described the sensation of leaving their bodies during heart attacks or road accidents. They tell the same basic story of looking down on their physical bodies while doctors try to revive them. “It was my mind, my personality, looking down”, they say, “but I was no longer part of my body.” Then suddenly they find themselves looking out through their eyes again and they have returned to the body. This is all that happens to people when they ‘die’. Their consciousness leaves the body. Our physical form has a finite life, of course, but our minds live forever. You could think of it as similar to the principle of the spaceman on the Moon. He dons an outer shell to experience another planet. During a physical life our minds inhabit the physical shell we call a body. Consciousness and energy are one and the same. All that exists"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiii throughout Creation is the same energy-consciousness in different states of being. The diference between everything is their level of consciousness (evolution, understanding, awareness), and the speed the energy is vibrating - at its ‘frequency’. The faster the vibration, the higher the evolution. One example of how a single substance can be many things is water, clouds and ice. These look, feel, and react very differently, but they are all the same substance in different states of being. So it is with the energy-consciousness that is everything. The force we call ‘God’ is not some guy with a beard sitting on a throne. It is the One Consciousness that is Creation; a wall, the sky, the rain, you, me, everything is ‘God’. We are all droplets in the same ocean of consciousness. You are me, and I am you. You are everything, and so am I. We are each other, all aspects of the same whole, part of the same seamless stream of energy. The apparent divisions between us are an illusion. One of the so-called ‘great mysteries’ is where we go after our physical lives have ended. The Church says to heaven or hell, whatever that is supposed to mean, and materialistic science says we go nowhere because this world is all there is. In fact the ocean of consciousness we call Creation or God has infinite levels of evolution or wavelengths. In the space your body is occupying now are all the frequencies of all the radio and television stations broadcasting to your area. You can’t see them and they can’t see each other, even though they are sharing the same space, because they are on different wavelengths. Tune a radio to one of those wavelengths and that is the station you will here. The frequency becomes the radio’s reality, its ‘world’. Move the dial to another station and the radio’s reality changes. It is the same with us. At this time we are tuned to the dense physical wavelength we call the Universe, but when we ‘die’ our consciousness leaves the body and moves on to another wavelength. What we call ‘ghosts’ are entities - minds, spirits, - on other wavelengths. They often look misty and transparent, because we are not seeing them from their frequency, but ours. It is the same when a radio dial, is not quite on the station and you get a fuzzy, less-than- sharp reception. The dominating station will be the one nearest the dial but you will hear other stations, too. In visual terms, that is what is happening when we see a ghost. If you were on the same frequency as the ghost, it would look as real as you do. The extra-terrestrials I will be talking about operate at least mostly on other frequencies,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv which is why some people see them and some don’t. It depends whatever you are capable of making that psychic leap to tune to other levels. It is by tuning your consciousness to another wavelength that information can be brought through this world. This is the process we call channelling, mediumship, or tuning in psychically. Real, open- minded, scientists are showing in their research into physics and mathematics that Creation is, indeed, made up of frequencies, and that consciousness is eternal in everyone. However, they have to contend with the suppression of this knowledge by the scientific establishment and the manipulators who control it. These want you to believe that the physical world is all there is and that we are all cosmic ‘accidents’ of evolution who don’t exist before birth or after death. What nonsense! Consciousness is constantly reproducing itself as Creation expands into the void and into infinity. At the highest level, the highest frequency, is the original consciousness from which everything has come. It is the sum total of all that has been learned and experienced since Creation became conscious. This is the level you could call the Godhead. I prefer to call it the Source. It, too, is constantly evolving by observing and absorbing the experiences of all aspects of itself on the lower frequencies. The Source is the Super Mind from which everything has come. I have used the term ‘mind’ to describe the eternal part of us, because I prefer to avoid the religious connotations of ‘soul’. But mind, soul, and spirit are interchangeable for terms to describe the amalgamation of energy fields that animate the physical body and which never die. These exist on what science calls the sub-atomic level which is why we can’t see them. The energies normally vibrate too quickly for our physical senses, although some sensitive people can detect them. When we talk of people ‘seeing auras’ they are observing this consciousness around the body. It can be a glorious tapestry of colours, our ‘coat of many colours’ which changes with our moods because colours, like everything else, are energy vibrations. As our state of mind alters, so do the subtleties of our vibrational state. These energy fields, aspects of our mind, reincarnate into countless physical bodies on this planet and elsewhere. We are all extraterrestrials, in that we are here on this planet as part, and only part, of our evolution. Each of us will have had past lives throughout"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xv what we call history. We have been here many times in so many different situations and races. This makes the prejudice of racism and nationalism so utterly ludicrous. Through the law of karma or cause and effect we are creating our own futures with every thought and act, because it is true that what we make others experience we will ourselves eventually experience to balance out our evolution. Connecting all our energy fields is a series of vortices called chakras. There are seven main ones and countless smaller versions. The main chakras are at the base of the spine (base chakra), the navel (sacral chakra), the solar plexus (solar plexus chakra), the heart (heart chakra), the throat (throat chakra), the forehead (brow or third eye chakra) and on top of the head (crown chakra). As we learn and evolve, the chakra vortices spin quicker and raise the vibration of our eternal being, so elevating us to higher frequencies. The energy we call love comes from the heart chakra and this is how the heart first became associated with love. Today it is portrayed as a physical heart, but, as the ancients knew, the energy of love emanates from the spiritual heart. The chakras are linked to the physical body through the endocrine system, and imbalances in the energy fields can affect the balance of the body. It is in this way that stress and other emotional trauma cause physical illness. These energy fields are electromagnetic and are affected by other forms of electromagnetism. It is known that people who work with electromagnetic equipment or live under power lines are more prone to certain illnesses and cancers. Doctors and scientists say they don’t know why this happens, but in fact the eletromagnetism from the power lines and technology disrupts the person’s electromagnetic energy fields, and this filters down to the physical body to manifest as a health problem. The mind is a creator because everything is thought. The more powerful the consciousness, the greater its potential to create. On the non-physical frequencies thought creates directly by rearranging the energies into whatever the thought visualises. Even on the dense physical level, all creation must be preceded by a thought. A finalised business deal and a finished piece of pottery are thoughts made physical. Thought is all. Every time we think we create an energy field, a thought form, and this is how telepathy works. One person produces the thought field and another decodes that field, mostly without even knowing it. The power of thought to create love and harmony or hate and disharmony"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvi is endless and we are all capable of producing both. The manipulators I speak of in this book know about this power to control people by the use of thought or ‘psychic attack’ as it is called. They direct thought energy at targeted individuals and try to control their thinking. Those who seek love and harmony in the world need to respond to this misguided behaviour with the energy of love and harmony which we can all create whenever we wish. Wejust have to think it and live it. We create our own reality. If we think failure, that is the energy we will attract to us. We attract what we most fear, for example, on the principle of like attracts like and this is the basis on which the Law of Karma operates also. The manipulators do not want us to know that we are eternal beings of light and love with limitless potential; nor that we can change the world by changing the way we think; and certainly not that we are all One, all equal parts of the same whole, on ajourney of evolution through experience. People who know and live all these things are not nearly so easy to control and direct. It would be much better to persuade us that we are cosmic accidents with no future, or imprison us in the dogma of some rigid religion, and do everything possible to ridicule and repress information to the contrary. Their aim is to de-link us from the higher levels of ourselves. During an incarnation, not all of our mind, consciousness, incarnates and becomes subject to the severe pressures and limitations of a dense physical body, only part of it. I call this the conscious level. The rest of the mind, what has become known as the subconscious and higher conscious levels, act as a guide through a physical life. The conscious level (lower self) experiences and the subconscious and higher conscious levels (higher self) guides through a process of thought transfer. The higher self can be linked to Mission Control. It knows the reason for the incarnation - what we have chosen to experience and who with - and what we have chosen to do in service to humanity, the planet, and Creation in general. We feel the urgings and communciations of the higher self in our intuition. We feel drawn to certain places, people, and ways of life. It shows when we say “fancy meeting you here”, “what a small world”, and “what a coincidence”. If we lose touch with Mission Control, our higher consciousness, we can get ourselves into terrible trouble and be prone to some stupid and destructive behaviour. Think what would happen if we were on the Moon in a spacesuit and someone cut the link with Mission"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvii Control. We would have only two sources of information - what is coming in through the eyes and the ears. This would, by definition, be extremely imbalanced, because it would only contain information from the world immediately around us. We would lose contact with those who can see the wider picture. So if we can be encouraged to switch off the connection with our personal Mission Control, the higher self, and the manipulators can at the same time control the flow of information coming in through the eyes and the ears, we can quite easily forget who we really are and what we are doing here. This has happened to billions of people, who have thus become a form of robot. I have explained these principles in greater depth in other books, and it would be helpful for those new to the subject to read Heal The World or Truth Vibrations in conjunction with this one. But within the brief summary here is contained the knowledge as you will appreciate later that can not only free the human race from its current mental imprisonment, but also provide incredible technology to produce limitless, non-polluting energy. Why and how this knowledge has been kept from the mass of the people and what has led humanity along such a dark and destructive path is the story we will now tell."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1 PART ONE THE DARKNESS"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2 1 The Takeover Bid When anyone talks about the origin of God they soon find themselves facing familiar, unanswerable questions: ‘Who created God?’ and ‘Who created the one who created God?’ and... You will forgive me, therefore, if I deal with only one generation of God’s family history! My belief is that what we call Creation was once a void that was mere potential. At some point, at least a part of this void became conscious and aware of itself. I know some open- minded scientists who have offered explanations based on mathematics and physics of how this could have happened, but all I am sure about is that it did happen. I will call this original consciousness The Source. Over an incomprehensible period of what we call time the Source Consciousness began to experiment with its potential to create. Through the power of thought, it created other aspects of itself and areas within its vast mind for experience and learning. Among these was our Universe and all that it contains - including us. Each area is relatively self-contained within the Ocean of Consciousness and has been allowed to evolve naturally through experience, although all remains connected to the Source. Universes, like all of Creation, are made up of multi-dimensions with each having its own version of space and time. What we call time on this planet is very different from that of other frequencies. If you saw our space-time Universe from above, it would look a little like a doughnut or, more to the point, a coil going round and round, orbiting the centre. Everything is in orbit around a central point. The Earth is orbiting the Sun, as we all know, but the solar system is also in orbit, as are the galaxy and the Universe. Each ‘coil’ is encircled within a vortex, a spiral of energy. The quicker this spiral vortex spins, the quicker the Universe moves through its orbit and, consequently, the quicker ‘time’ appears to pass. The vortex around our Universe is beginning to spin more"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"3 quickly which is why when so many people say, ‘time just flies these days, there’s no time to do everything any more’, they are absolutely right. Hold on tight. We have seen nothing yet. Streams of information emanate from The Source to guide Creation while, from the other direction, flow all the experiences and learning achieved by its constituent parts. There is a two-way flow of information between the Source and all areas of its mind. So, while the Source is the ultimate in knowledge, wisdom and love at any given point, it, too, is constantly evolving as it absorbs the experiences of all its ‘droplets’. The flow of information from the Source comes to this planet via various ‘sub-stations’ such as the Universe and Galaxy. It comes in through the Sun to the planets of this solar system. Each level adds its contribution to the information flow to guide the levels below. The Sun is far more than a massive ball of fire, generating warmth. It is another substation for Source energies. The ancients knew this, or at least their most highly evolved members did, and this is one explanation for the origin of the Sun god and Sun worship. The more enlightened members of their number were not worshipping a ball of fire in the sky, they were acknowledging the Solar Logos (Central Sun) through which the knowledge and wisdom of the Source reaches the planet. Just as the Sun is the mind that guides the solar system; the Galactic Mind guides the galaxy and the Universal Mind guides the Universe. The Source is the mind that guides all Creation. Sun spot activity is linked to this flow of energy from the Sun to the solar system and this indicates the times when the flow is at its most powerful. We all have the opportunity to tune into this guidance from the highest level, the Source, but we don’t have to. We can ignore it if we wish. It may seem hard to believe sometimes when we look at what is happening in the world, but Creation is another word for love. It is the energy we call love that holds everything together. Creation is not designed to bring pain and suffering. That is not its purpose. I know that people from all beliefs and backgrounds have tried to explain this contradiction between a Creation based on love and some of the appalling events that happen minute by minute on Planet Earth. Some speak of the need for learning through extreme experience while others talk of some massive universal ‘experiment’ that has been going on. Neither has felt right to me. If Creation is founded and held together by love, then love must be at the heart of what has happened"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4 to the Earth and the human race. Just as this book was being completed, I heard an explanation which, at last, felt good to me. I was sitting in the quiet of the abbey ruins on a wonderful summer day at Glastonbury in Somerset, England, not far from the famous Glastonbury Tor. With me was a very close friend of my family and myself, a highly sensitive psychic called Yeva. She began to channel information projected by a blue energy field she saw psychically around us. From what came through that day and from the other information I have received directly or through other channels, I feel that the following is close to the truth, at least in theme: A very long time ago, an aspect of consciousness became highly imbalanced and decided to challenge the laws of Creation. These were not laws written down in a book and administered by a judge. They were, you might say, like the laws of physics. Everything needs a negative-positive and male-female balance if harmony is to reign in its consciousness. The balance does not have to be perfect, because both negative and positive experiences are necessary for evolution. But the further you stray from balance, the more extreme life becomes. If you go too far to the positive polarity you lose touch with the practical side of life; you float off in a spiritual mist. It’s a bit like the feeling I am told you have when you smoke pot or, as I can report from experience, the feeling you have after drinking a few beers. You are not quite here. Everyone can be very nice to everyone else, but nothing gets done. If you have a serious negative imbalance, this will manifest itself in extreme negative behaviour - anger, aggression, conflict, a wish to control and dominate, pain, fear and suffering in all its forms. I will call the droplet seeking to disharmonise Creation, Lucifer. I will use the term Lucifer when I am speaking of the original droplet of disharmony and Luciferic consciousness when I am describing the amalgamation of that aspect and all the other consciousness he has since imbalanced, to the extent that it now dances to his tune. In fact, Lucifer is a misnomer really, in that, if you go back to the origin of the name Lucifer, it breaks down as ‘bringer of light’. This comes from the universal truth that positive energy needs a negative balancer. When both are in harmony, you get the energy of balance and love which is called The Light. The positive needs the negative as much as the negative needs the positive. This idea of the balancing of two forces, positive-negative, male-female, good-evil, yin-yang and so on, I totally agree with. But, for the purposes of this book, I"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"5 will use the name Lucifer to describe something quite different from that. The imbalanced consciousness I will call Lucifer is not an essential part of the positive-negative balance. He is a disrupting, disharmonious aspect of consciousness which is not necessary for human evolution. More than that, Lucifer’s efforts to close off the channels that link humanity to its higher understanding have blocked, not advanced, our evolution. No experience is wasted and all goes into the bank of learning, but I feel strongly that we did not need to plumb the depths in order to reach the state of understanding that will raise us to a higher frequency. A balance of negative and positive experience is one thing, but I do not believe the negative extremes we have seen on Earth have had to be part of that. Lucifer wished to experiment with the laws of balance and harmony. I refer to this mind as ‘he’ because he is dominated, not only by negative energy, but by male energy also. At one time he was a consciousness of balance, love and advanced evolution - but that was to change. It may well be that something happened which was beyond his control but which initially imbalanced this aspect of consciousness. It could be that an experiment he conducted into what would happen if you opposed the laws of harmony went terribly wrong - rather like creating a spiritual Frankenstein which ends up controlling the scientist. Whatever the background, Lucifer began to challenge the harmony of Creation. I have long been aware of this but Yeva’s channelling added a decisive piece to the puzzle. It answered the question of why humanity has been a target of this Luciferic Consciousness. Creation is not some random, uncoordinated, every-droplet-for- itself chaos. When this Luciferic consciousness began to make its disharmony felt, the higher levels of Creation began to intervene because it was imposing its misunderstandings on others and breaking the universal law of free will. Something had to be done, as they say. This is where humanity comes in. Again, contrary to popular belief, the human consciousness stream has an enormous capacity for love and compassion. We are not what we seem to be, but then nothing is ever what it seems. A decision was made at the collective level of human consciousness to give this disruptive mind called Lucifer an opportunity to find its balance again and to re- synchronise with the rest of Creation. Every species has a collective mind to which all of the individual ‘droplets’ are connected. We are multi-dimensional beings, with each"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6 level having its own awareness and ability to think and make decisions. So it was that the collective mind of humanity agreed to set aside its own evolution for a certain period to give the Luciferic consciousness a chance to re-balance itself. This highly negative consciousness was unleashed on this part of the Universe. It was not only humanity which agreed to this, the collective minds of other universal civilisations (extra-terrestrials) did the same, and not only the physical level was affected. Everything is multidimensional, including the Universe. In the same space occupied by this physical world are all the other levels. The Luciferic consciousness began to operate on those levels, too. The effects did not happen overnight. But disharmony creates more disharmony and, once the Luciferic consciousness had begun to disrupt the balance and flow of the energies, it started a roll which would gather pace on an ever-steepening curve. Disharmony created even more disharmony. Lucifer is clearly not a being with horns and a tail. He is a large aspect of Divine consciousness which chose to work against the Source. Like all consciousness, he generates thought patterns. It is the same principle as that employed by a radio station when it transmits its wavelength to the world. Once transmitted, the wavelength can be picked up by any radio tuned to that station. Everyone is transmitting thought patterns every second. So, when you have a powerful and ever-growing aspect of consciousness pouring Qut negative patterns of great disharmony, it is easy to see how vast areas of other consciousness can be affected. Once they are tuned to your wave-length you can, like a radio station, feed them any information you wish them to hear. In consciousness terms, these transmitted patterns can appear to be thoughts of our own when they really originate in the minds of others. In such instances, we are merely tuning to them without realising it. The Luciferic consciousness and its broadcasts were designed to create imbalance. Lucifer feeds off negative en&gy and the more of that that he can generate, the stronger and more powerful he becomes. His impact began to grow and affect a wider area. Other droplets were imbalanced by the disharmony and turmoil and joined the ‘team’ or what I call collectively the Luciferic consciousness. The thinking and perceptions of increasing numbers of entities in this solar system and galaxy were affected. The Luciferic consciousness, far from taking the opportunity to re-balance itself, was trying to take over and turn harmony into the image of its own imbalance. The"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"7 moment arrived when the ongoing process of disharmony was such that a call went out across the Universe for volunteers to dedicate themselves, for however long was necessary, to reverse it. The ocean of consciousness was ceasing to be a gentle, balanced flow. In some areas it was more like a tidal wave of emotional and mental turmoil and torment. Throughout the book I will refer to the ‘volunteers’ or ‘volunteer consciousness’. By this I mean those who have dedicated themselves to restore harmony and help the Earth to re-synchronise with the rest of the Galactic and Universal family. These volunteers came forward on many levels and the struggle began between light and dark, a theme seen throughout ancient texts and legends. This has been portrayed symbolically in films like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The writers of much science fiction are really tapping into a memory of what actually happened, not always in detail, but in theme. This struggle between harmony and disharmony has been happening on all levels, physical and non- physical. Other volunteers, aspects of very highly-evolved consciousness, came into the Universe and this galaxy in an effort to restore harmony. They did not incarnate in physical bodies on the Earth. They arrived in massive spacecraft, some of them miles in length, while others simply manifested themselves here. These were extra- terrestrials who came to bring knowledge to this planet hundreds of thousands of years ago. There were two distinct life streams on the planet then, the highly evolved extra-terrestrials and the much more primitive Earth people. The idea was that, over thousands of years, the Earth people would be helped to evolve more quickly. Waves of these beings began many civilisations on the Earth, including the ones we know as Pan, Mu (Lemuria) and Atlantis. These civilisations were much more advanced in their technology and understanding of Creation than we are today. Plato talked of Atlantis more than two thousand years ago and it has been a theme that has recently grown more powerful in the human mind. It was a continent in what is now the Atlantic Ocean. Atlantis was powered by the use of non-physical energy, the harnessing of the sea of energy around us. Crystals were part of this power and light Source and all the power and warmth they needed was produced without any pollution or damage to the Earth. That knowledge is going to be available to us as the present transformation continues. Indeed, much of it is already available but has been suppressed to protect empires"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8 of self interest. There was no religion as such at that time but there were places where people went to learn the laws of Creation and how to use energies to create harmony and to speed the positive progress of human understanding. They could communicate with animals telepathically and through sound, particularly with that most evolved of non-human life, the dolphin. The Atlanteans could perform what we would see today as miracles. They were not miracles at all. There is no such thing as a miracle or the paranormal. They are simply the natural laws of Creation at work. Atlanteans could levitate objects and themselves at will; they could cause spontaneous combustion; they could manifest and de-manifest matter. They raised its vibratory rate until it ceased to be physical. Then, when they restored its original vibration, it reappeared as a physical form. Their bodies were different from ours and very different from those of the Earth people on the planet at that time. They were less dense and they could float above the ground through the power of their consciousness. Many could materialise and de-materialise themselves along the lines of ‘Beam me up, Scotty’ in Star Trek but without the need for its technology. They were much taller than we are. Sensitive people who have had visions of this Atlantean time speak of seeing figures of seven feet and more, with gold complexions and slanting, pale blue eyes. The Atlanteans also lived for many hundreds of years in each incarnation because their bodies were more in tune with the energies around them. As they understood the true nature of life, they could treat disease (disharmony) before it became a physical problem. Today we wait for the physical symptoms but, by then, it is often too late. The volunteer consciousness which are known as Atlanteans came to raise the understanding on this planet in order to help the Luciferic consciousness to break out of its spiral of disharmony and to protect the human consciousness from being affected by that disharmony. All was well in Atlantis for a long time, but slowly the imbalances and pressures which continued to build up under the bombardment of the Luciferic consciousness began to tell. Over aeons of existence, the Luciferic consciousness had learned how best to disrupt harmony and how to imbalance other aspects by working through their emotional levels. The production of negative energy by whatever means available was the motivation because such negative energy feeds it and gives it greater power. The reason for conflict was irrelevant as long as there was conflict and a production line of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"9 negative energy. Planets were destroyed, either by direct intervention from Lucifer or by his thought patterns scrambling the consciousness of others. A planet known by the Sumerians as Maldek was destroyed by nuclear explosion created by scientists who had the knowledge without the wisdom. (See Allan & Delair’s When The Earth Nearly Died). Some of the debris of that planet and others is still flying around the solar system in forms we call asteroids and comets. Some of the debris is held in the rings of Saturn. Too incredible to accept? Look what we are doing to this planet. We are destroying her by the stupid way in which we behave and that is what has happened elsewhere, either through exploitation, nuclear explosions, or by the poisoning of the atmosphere in some other way. Has humanity as a whole been under the influence of a force for good? No. Exactly. The time arrived when Luciferic extra-terrestrials sought to take over the planet and wars were fought between the, by now, countless extra-terrestrial civilisations that wished to either help or exploit this world. The harmony of early. Atlantis had long gone. The Earth which was created as the planet of balance and a generator of love began to pour out negative energy into the system. Things were going terribly wrong and it was having a serious affect on the mind of the planet, the consciousness we call Mother Nature, the Earth Spirit, or Gaia. The Earth is the dense physical body of this mind and we all exist within her energy field, her aura. When humanity creates negative energy she absorbs it and, through her, it is exported to the solar system, the Universe, and beyond. Lucifer turned his negative power on the Earth Spirit, working to disrupt her on all levels by imbalancing her energy fields - especially her mind and emotions. His thought patterns worked on her emotions both directly and by affecting her physical form. When our bodies are giving us pain it affects our emotions. A planet consciousness is no different. The extra-terrestrial volunteers who agreed to restore harmony and to raise consciousness on the physical level found themselves facing an enormous challenge from other extra- terrestrial sources who came to the planet in their enormous spacecraft. Many were so affected that they, also, began to work for the negative forces. Knowledge is neutral. It is how you use it that is positive or negative. Those who understood how the energies and the power of crystals could be used were known in Atlantis as the Guardians of the Light and the Keepers of the Secret Knowledge. Only those who, it"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"10 was felt, could be trusted to use the knowledge positively were told of its secrets. However, here we had a situation where the power of the Lucifer influence was such that many of these people had become seriously imbalanced. As a consequence, knowledge which was potentially lethal was falling into the wrong hands. Many Atlanteans began to use their knowledge in highly negative ways as did the extra-terrestrials who hijacked Atlantis. For hundreds of thousands of years during Atlantis and earlier, extra-terrestrials from various universal civilisations had been seeding the human race and advancing the physical form. Some did this for positive reasons, some with their own agenda in mind. The themes of this are documented in ancient texts and on clay tablets written some 6,000 years ago by the Sumerians. The Sumer records speak of ‘gods’ coming down from the sky to impregnate women and then returning to the stars. The human form as we know it, Homo Sapiens Sapiens to give it its full title, did not evolve from the ape family but from other universal civilisations around 20,000 years or so before the final cataclysm sank what remained of Atlantis about 10,OOOBC. In fact, the ape family came from the impregnation of animal forms by ETs as part of their experimentation. Scientists talk of the ‘missing link’ between Neanderthal man and the present human body, but they will never find it, because it doesn’t exist. The sudden evolutionary advance in the human form came from the intervention of extra-terrestrials some positive in their intent, some negative. The Sumer records say that a ‘god’ called Ea was involved in this genetic engineering. They say he had a half-brother called En-lil and, as we will see, these were two of the Sumer ‘gods’ that would be passed on into the belief systems of religions to this day. Most of the early Old Testament stories come from Sumer or earlier and relate to this time towards the end of Atlantis when negative ETs were largely in control. A Sumerian ‘hymn’ has been discovered which describes the tree of life, the fruit of which the gods had forbidden Man to eat. This tree was in the Garden of Edinnu, a word which means plain. In this garden, according to the hymn, you would find the god, Ea. How short a step this is to Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden in the Bible. The Sumer depiction of the Garden of Edinnu even included a snake curled around a tree. The Garden of Edinnu and its recycled version, the Garden of Eden, are highly symbolic of what was happening from the later Atlantis period and is still happening today."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"11 Adam and Eve (sym bolising Earth Man and Woman) were told not to eat from the tree of knowledge. In other words, they were to be kept in ignorance so that they would not learn of their true nature. This is a theme which has continued throughout human history up to the present day. I call it ‘the Mushroom Approach’ - keep them in the dark and feed them bulishit. According to William Bramley, in his book The Gods of Eden, the serpent in the Adam and Eve story is symbolic of something called the Brotherhood of the Snake (or serpent) which he believes was set up to give spiritual knowledge to an ignorant humanity by those who wished to help them. Bramley’s research leads him to suggest that the ‘god’ known as Ea, or Prince of Earth, by the Sumerians who helped to create and genetically engineer the new human form, did not wish to see them mentally, spiritually, and physically imprisoned. He did some less-than-advisable things himself, Bramley believes, but he was genuine in his desire to challenge this oppression. Unfortunately, the highly negative, Lucifer-controlled ETs were so hostile to this that the serpent or snake became synonymous with evil and Ea, the ‘Prince of the Earth’ became known as the Prince of Darkness. It was nothing more or less than the kind of character assassination, fuelled by lies and propaganda, which we see going on all the time in the modern world. Those who have read the Adam and Eve story will recall that the serpent, symbolic of Ea, in Bramley’s view, did not have the opportunity to persuade them to eat from another tree, the Tree of Life. He was stopped. William Bramley believes that the Brotherhood of the Snake was eventually taken over by the negative ETs and used for their own purposes - to keep the knowledge secret from the mass of the people and to pass it on only to an elite who could be trusted to support the ‘great work’ of world control and domination. These would be natural leaders of the people, such as kings and priests, in the civilisations that would follow Atlantis. The aim was to disconnect the conscious level of our being from our higher levels to such an extent that our Earth consciousness would be trapped in the dense physical world and be unable to escape and evolve. Eternal slaves is what they wished to create according to Bramley. I don’t know if his interpretations of the Sumer stories are correct in detail, but I have no problem with the idea of an ET involvement on Earth during Atlantis and before. I have long believed that extra-terrestrials seeded the present human form. This is"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"12 where the different races originally came from, with their many colours and features. Those ETs seeking to help humanity to advance have been seeding human bodies in order to make genetic improvements and to make it easier for the spirit to express its full potential. Put simply, the human form has been subjected to a sort of genetic tug-of-war. I also feel that an organisation, which I will call the Brotherhood, has been used over thousands of years to manipulate the human race, and never more so than today. The extreme negativity which prevailed on the Earth in the latter periods of Atlantis had other implications. Every living form has an energy system, a web of lines linking with the chakras to maintain the flow of lifeforce energies. Acupuncture is based on this understanding. Its practitioners call the lines meridians and the same system applies to planets. A planet has chakras and a grid of energy lines known, depending on your preference, as meridians, ley lines or dragon lines. If you damage and disrupt this energy grid enough you can destroy a planet in the same way that a human body dies when its energy system is sufficiently imbalanced. The basis of acupuncture is to keep the human system in harmony and the physical body healthy. Acupuncture needles are employed to rebalance and redirect the flow of energy. There are certain points, known as acupuncture points, where this can be done most efficiently. So it is with the Earth. Misuse of knowledge began to threaten this energy grid. Those Atlanteans who were still holding on to the values that brought them here were guided by the higher levels to turn down the power of the energies flowing through and around the planet. The more powerful the energies, the greater was the potential for creation or, should they be misused, for catastrophe. Most Atlanteans were, by now, out of control and the only way to prevent them from destroying the Earth was to reduce the power and potential of the energies available to them. The spacecraft that come to the planet use these energy lines for their power and, if the power is reduced, you reduce the potential for harnessing that power for negative reasons. A piece of channelled information I used in my book Truth Vibrations explained it like this: “In the Atlantean period there were many energies being used and information and knowledge being used which were for particular reasons of safety withdrawn, shall we say, to prevent complete catastrophe, to prevent total destruction of your planet. One could s ay these were sort of emergency measures, if you like, to prevent the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"13 inhabitants of this planet from an untimely destruction”. I believe that the story of King Arthur and Merlin is, at least in part, a symbolic tale of this turning-down of the energies. I feel these tales relate to Atlanteans and only became legends of knights and kings much later when these kind of stories would have been more readily understood by those they were designed to inform. This also applies to many of the stories in ancient texts which became the Bible. The King Arthur story was, you might say, a sort of parable. The sword Excalibur, I feel, is symbolic of the turning off of those powerful energies - the ‘dragon energies’ as some people call them. Legend has it that the sword (the energies) was fixed into a stone and only one person had the gifts to remove it. Put another way, only someone with the correct energy pattern can unlock the vibratory key to release the energies which have lain dormant since Atlantis. This process is happening today. ‘Excalibur’ is being removed and unleashed across the planet. This is being done primarily in Britain and Ireland because this was where the big switch-off was achieved all those thousands of years ago. However, many other locations on the planet are involved, too. The Earth’s energy field is now being prepared for its imminent evolution to a higher frequency as the period of Luciferic opportunity comes to an end. The channelled explanation went on: “As in your human body, there are energy lines around your planet, through your planet, which correspond, I suppose, very much to the acupuncture lines and meridians in your body. where two lines cross, you create a vortex, a tiny vortex it’s two. The more lines that intersect, the bigger the vortex. Therefore when you have a chakra you have a large vortex of intersecting energy. It is the same with your planet. Where most lines cross there is the biggest vortex. Now you could say that the plexus (network) in and around the Islands you call the British Isles is the hub of the wheel of plexuses and energies which surround your planet. It has acted in other times like a fail-safe device. In order to activate these chakric points upon your planet, the energies must all pass through the central point. They must pass through the heart of the pattern.” The number of those who had the knowledge of this central point and how to close it down were very few. The keys to this point were “a consciousness pattern, a series of harmonic equations, known"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"14 only to the keepers of that pattern.” My belief is that the energies that were switched off, or at least massively turned down, were, in part, the Earth’s kundalini energies. These energies in the base chakra, often symbolised by the snake, serpent or dragon, are a seat of our power. The Atlanteans knew how to work with this power but, as with all things, power can be used constructively or destructively. In their later days they chose destruction and the source of their power had to be removed. The suppressing of the kundalini flow obviously had great emotional, physical and mental effects on the Earth as a physical and spiritual entity and the power and knowledge within her aura (the energies we live within and are part of) was consequently diminished. In evolutionary terms, the Earth Spirit and humanity went backwards. At the time that Yeva channelled the information about humanity giving the Luciferic Consciousness the chance to re-balance itself, she was also shown a symbolic vision of how this has affected human evolution. She saw the energy stream ofevolution going forwards and then suddenly turning back on itself before returning to the starting point, so completing a large loop. It is within that symbolic loop that the period of Luciferic opportunity has unfolded. We are now coming back to the point where it all began in terms of our evolution. When the loop is complete, the period of opportunity will be over and we will continue our evolution without the extreme negative influence of the Luciferic disrujption. Once the harmonic ‘key’ was turned at the end of Atlantis, the power no longer existed for the imbalanced Atlanteans to destroy everything. The vibratory rate fell and the density of the planet increased. The Earth was falling down the wavelengths of consciousness and disconnecting from a powerful link with higher levels of being. With every fall, the levels of understanding, knowledge and wisdom available to the human race were correspondingly reduced. This, for me, is what is really meant by the Fall of Man. It is the fall down the frequencies of knowledge and wisdom into denser matter. As the fall continued, humanity ‘forgot’ about Atlantis because we were falling further and further away in consciousness terms from the frequency on which all that happened. With the frequencies rising today, we will be remembering more and more about Atlantis as the fall is reversed and Earth’s kundalini and other energies are re-released. The behaviour of the Atlanteans and the efforts of the Luciferic"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"15 Consciousness so affected the Earth’s energy field that Atlantis was sunk in stages by colossal earthquakes, volcanoes and tidal waves. It could well be that at least the final cataclysms were caused by a rebalancing beam passing across the Earth, which I will explain more fully in a moment. The effect of this ‘photon beam’, as some people call it, is to rebalance energy fields. If an energy field is fundamentally out of balance the rebalancing process can create staggering physical and mental effects. I’m sure that some kind of nuclear war broke out, too, and that the Earth was also hit during the destruction of Atlantis by a large piece of debris, possibly part of the remains of Maldek. The energies are electromagnetic and different energy fields attract or repel each other. Like attracts like in these circumstances. So, if the Earth’s energy field goes through a highly negative phase, it is more likely to attract to itself other negative fields - like the debris careering around the galaxy. I feel that, among the planets, at least the Moon and Venus have ‘gone walkabout’ before dropping into their present orbits. This would clearly have caused fantastic upheavals as they shattered the balance within the energy fields of other planets and star systems. This series of incredible geological events in several distinct phases caused, no doubt, by a variety of reasons, ended the civilisation called Atlantis. Researchers have found evidence of a 10,000ft uplift in the Andes about ten thousand years ago. This is because whole mountain ranges soared from the surface of the Earth during these periods. There was a magnetic pole shift and a tilt of the Earth on its axis. This sent a fantastic tidal wave around the planet. The giant crystal at the centre of the Atlantean power system was lost under the ocean and it is this which might be creating the strange phenomenon known as the Bermuda Triangle. From time to time, it might open a gateway from one dimension to another. Other planets of this solar system which were highly imbalanced went through similar upheavals and all hell broke loose across a wide area. It seems to me that the Earth fell out of alignment, in some way, with the universal energy grid. The turning down of the energy points and the vibratory ‘fall’ trapped the Atlantean consciousness within the Earth’s frequencies and many who could have escaped chose, for various reasons, to stay and carry on the work. To do this, they had to begin the cycle of incarnating from the Earth’s non-physical frequencies into the human form. This process included the volunteers who were still on the path and those who had either been led astray by the Luciferic"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"16 Consciousness or were aspects of that consciousness. Other volunteers could not stand the falling frequencies and left before it was too late. The Earth’s vibration and atmosphere became much denser it was too late. The Earth’s vibration and atmosphere became much denser and the light/dark struggle would manifest in a different way. I am not sure exactly why, but from now on the ET presence on Earth, both negative and positive, would take another form. Most of their influence was felt by affecting human consciousness by planting ideas, beliefs, and thought patterns. I do think that they still came in their spacecraft to observe, support, or manipulate depending on their state of being, but it was mostly done in much more subtle ways and was very different from the Atlantis and pre-Atlantis times. Since the end of Atlantis, those who continued to work for the evolution of the planet and humanity have been incarnating to spread the spiritual truths and prepare the World for today’s great time of change. As a channelled communication said: “There are many of you for whom the Earth is not your indigenous evolutionary home, shall we say. There are many of you on this planet who come from other spheres of evolution. I think these have been called ‘5tar children’ by some of your writers, that is a good enough expression. More evolved beings came to your planet and manifested on your planet in Atlantean times. This was the biggest impulse in bringing the new knowledge into Atlantis which caused it to grow into the civilisation that it was. New knowledge was brought into this system from universal sources from highly evolved spirits, bringing knowledge into the planet. And you‘re going to bring it back, basically.” A plan was set in motion to restore the Earth after Atlantis. This plan had three main motivations: To help the Luciferic Consciousness to re-harmonise before its ‘opportunity’ period came to an end, To seek to protect human consciousness from further imbalance, To check the fall of the Earth’s energy field to ever lower vibrations. This final point is crucial to what is happening on the planet today. Creation is self-balancing. You can push it out of balance for a certain period but then it kicks back to find harmony. This loop of opportunity for the Luciferic consciousness had a definite time scale"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"17 and now, in the lifetimes of our generations, it is coming to a close. It is time for Planet Earth to return to its original evolutionary road. Everything from the inside of an atom to a universe is in orbit around a central point. Some researchers believe that our solar system, together with a much wider area, is in orbit around the star system known as the Pleiades. According to the writer Paul Otto Hesse, this orbit is centred in particular around Alcyone, the brightest star in the Pleiades. Some people say it takes 24,000 years for our sun to complete such an orbit. Hesse believes that it is from Alcyone and the Pleiades that the photon beam I have mentioned is projected. It is a beam of highly charged energy particles that rebalances and re- synchronises all energy fields that pass through it. I use the term Photon Beam for simplicity, but that term, and the location of Alcyone, are Hesse’s research, not mine. I know it only as a synchronisation beam and have no idea of its exact composition nor from where it emanates. But the effect is the same: Fantastic transformation. As the beam is a circle, each orbit of our solar system around Alcyone (if that is correct) takes us through the beam twice. It is estimated that it takes around 2,000 years to pass completely through it. No matter what state of imbalance a planet may be experiencing, the passage through the photon beam will re-balance it at the vibratory level most appropriate to its evolution. The vital point, however, is that the more imbalanced a planet’s energy field is when it enters that beam, the more disruption and upheaval will be caused in the re-balancing process. It is that potentially cataclysmic upheaval that the Volunteer consciousness has been trying to avoid by working to check the gathering imbalances caused by the Luciferic consciousness. You can see, given the potential consequences, what an act of love it has been for the human mind to offer this opportunity to that consciousness. The planet has already experienced the great upheaval which marked the end of Atlantis and it could happen again if we don’t flood the Earth’s energy field with love. The photon beam acts as a sort of harvester, giving the opportunity to those who are ready to move out of this level of existence to graduate to a higher one. During the Atlantean period it re-balanced the Earth’s energy field. The Earth, while being rebalanced, did not herself take that"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"18 THE PLEIDIAN SYSTEM: Alcyone is the brightest star in the constellation of Pleiades. Our sun takes 24,000 years to complete a full revolution around Alcyone."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"19 evolu tionary leap because it was not the right time. She could not have done so, anyway, with her energy field weakened by the switching off of certain key energy flows. Now the time is right for the Earth to make that evolutionary step and return to where she was before the Luciferic opportunity period began. In other words, the evolutionary ‘loop’ is being completed and the Earth is returning to her original evolutionary path. I think the same is true of the solar system and further afield. The Luciferic opportunity is coming to a close. The pass across the photon beam which is happening now will, I feel, be potentially more far-reaching in its effect than it was even during Atlantis. This time the whole energy field of Planet Earth is being ‘harvested’ and it is taking a massive step up in its evolution. Anyone who does not do the same will not be able to incarnate on the Earth after this process is complete because the Earth will be operating on too high a frequency for them to exist here until they have raised their own vibrations to match those of this planet. The idea of this re-balancing beam was identified by the Maya people more than a thousand years ago. When the Mayan Civilisation was at the height of its powers in Central America between around 435AD and 850AD, they were well ahead of today’s mainstream science in their understanding of Creation. This was because they, too, were, in part, an incarnation of the advanced volunteer consciousness. They would have channelled other fre quencies and possibly interacted with space visitors. They knew of these beam cycles crossing the Earth and produced a system,of numbers and symbols to measure these periods. According to the calculations the Maya left behind on their magnificent pyramids and temples, the current ‘great cycle’ of the Earth’s evolution began in 31 13Bc and will end in the year 2012. This corresponds with the prophecies of others such as Nostradamus who foresaw enormous change in this period, as one era of human evolution passed and another made its entrance. The year 2012 is when those who follow the Mayan calculations believe that Planet Earth will be re-synchronised. Different people put different time scales on these things, but they all agree on the basic period. My feeling is that the ‘window’ of time in which we will see the most dramatic change is between the 1990s and circa 2030. I will give more details of the effects of this period when we reach the present day in our chronological story. I felt it was worth mapping out the basic themes, however, at this early stage because it"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"20 will help to put into context much of what our story will describe. All over the Universe are other highly-evolved civilisations working to help humanity and the Earth. Some of their number come into incarnation, others travel here in spacecraft, and still others operate as channelled communicators to Earth people. These other civilisations have evolved to the point where they can think as individuals or link their minds collectively, so accessing all the knowledge and wisdom available in the sum total of the parts. Guiding the overall operation is a Galactic and Universal Consciousness which is given many names by channellers. This is the consciousness which is guiding the Earth and those in incarnation who are here to serve the Universe by serving humanity and the planet. That consciousness will, in turn, be guided by the Source. Against this line-up of love, however, are aspects of the Luciferic consciousness which also manifest in physical bodies, ETs, and as channelled communicators. These are guided by their version of a Universal consciousness which is in opposition to the Source and seeks to undermine the efforts of all those who wish to open the prison door for both humanity and the Earth. For many thousands of years, the evolution of Planet Earth has been dominated by the struggle between these two states of being, harmony and disharmony. Thanks to the re-balancing beam there can be only one winner - harmony. But this does not diminish the horrors which disharmony has visited, and will, for some little time longer, continue to visit upon the world."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"21 2 Collective Amnesia The Earth took a long time to recover from the cataclysms and, even when the physical surface began to heal, it was now a very different world. Gone was the knowledge that built Atlantis, because the frequency of consciousness that could be accessed on Earth was much lower and more primitive than it had been. The energy field had been re- balanced but the energies had come to rest, as it were, at a much lower frequency than they had once enjoyed. In vibratory terms it was like incarnating into treacle. It was even more difficult for those highly-evolved minds who were still working for the restoration of the planet to manifest that understanding while encased in a dense physical body. Their bodies were now denser than they had been in Atlantis and the limitations were subsequently greater than they had been used to. The power and potential of the energies around the planet were similarly curtailed. All this made the task of those incarnating to help the Earth immeasurably more demanding. The events at the end of Atlantis had attracted large numbers of beings to this area of Creation to help with the plan. The Earth’s energy field had to be prepared for the next crossing of the photon beam when it would return to its original evolutionary level and beyond. Other volunteers began to incarnate on to the Earth. But this dense physical frequency and many others continued to be dominated by the Luciferic disruption. That consciousness as expressed through negative ETs had been largely removed from the physical level of the planet by the rebalancing process but now it began to stimulate disharmony again. The lower frequency made this easier, if anything, and disharmony in the planet’s energy field gathered pace as the Luciferic consciousness entered the last stage of its ‘opportunity’ period - an opportunity it showed no signs of taking. I once had a vision of the Earth which took the form of a ball of glass like the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"22 ones you see hanging from the ceiling in discos and dance halls. As the ball spun, it was reflecting light in all directions. I believe this was symbolic of the role the Earth plays. But, instead of sending out light and love, she has been generating negative energy. She has become like a negativity production unit which is imbalancing and holding back the evolution of the solar system and all that is currently entering the photon beam and preparing to evolve. This is being made more difficult by the drag and disharmony of the Earth and the frequencies that surround her. This is creating vibratory pressures and tensions which are reaching a critical point. One piece of channelled information I used in Truth Vibrations said: The Universe needs the life the Earth brings forth and the whole must be preserved. It is not for you alone that we do this work. There has always been an order in the way the planets have been governed. Man has not understood the linkages which bind everything together.” This is another reason why the Volunteer consciousness is focusing on Planet Earth. What happens here affects a much wider area. All planets and stars are connected by a web of energy lines to a universal grid. If a chakra or pulse point on this grid is damaged or starts to generate imbalanced energies, it affects everything connected to that grid. These can eventually affect other frequencies and the imbalance can grow like a cancer. It has become clear to me over these years of my spiritual reawakening that, if the Earth goes on being abused, so much negative energy will be created that the consequences for the wider Universe could be very unpleasant as it goes through its evolutionary leap. The imbalances and density of the Earth affect humanity in many ways. It is worth repeating here that not all of our consciousness incarnates into a physical body and becomes subject to its severe limitations. The higher levels of our consciousness (higher self) stay on a non-physical level and guide the lower self through an incarnation. The higher self knows the lifeplan - what we hope to achieve and experience during that life. If, however, we lose touch with the higher self, Mission Control, we become dominated by the information coming in through the eyes and the ears and we are prey to the thought patterns directed at this level by the Luciferic consciousness. These work particularly on the emotions and the ego and, once the Lucifer patterns have control of those, they can, by"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"23 affecting our behaviour, cause untold pain and destruction. This is what has happened to the human race. We can come into incarnation with the best of intentions but, once we look out through our eyes and become subjected to all the information this level constantly bombards us with, we can forget why we are here and act in ways that are the exact opposite of what we intended before incarnation. This is especially so if the kundalini energies are suppressed because, in that state of being, the other chakras are not linked powerfully to the physical level. Thus, the physical is not fully connected to our higher levels. (The source of the kundalini energy is the base of the spine, the seat of our sexuality and of harmonious relationship.) It can be even worse if a higher self is working from one of the non-physical frequencies still dominated by that Luciferic consciousness. In these cases, you have a misguided lower self and a misguided higher self. There are also direct incarnations of the Lucifer consciousness. Look back through history and around the world today and you will see many examples of this. The im balances of the Earth, its density and a suppressed or imbalanced kundalini flow, make the connection and communication between higher and lower self much more difficult during an incarnation. With the influence of ‘Mission Controls’ getting weaker, lower selves come under the control of eyes and ears information. If Lucifer can manipulate that information and fill the human mind with negative thought patterns, it follows that he could encourage humanity to act in ways that generate yet more negative energy into the ocean of consciousness in which we exist. More negative energy increases the power of the Luciferic Consciousness. We can feel these energies when we meet someone and say, ‘Hey, I got bad vibes from him’. Or, perhaps, we go into a house and say, ‘I don’t like it in here - it’s eerie’. At these times we are feeling the non-physical energy generated by a person or by others in the past. What we call atmosphere is really the energy, negative or positive, generated by human beings or non-physical entities. The atmosphere we describe at football matches, for instance, is made up of the energies generated by the crowd. Since the end of Atlantis, the imbalances have been fuelled both by the thought patterns transmitted by the Luciferic consciousness and by the negative energies generated by humanity. As a result, the Earth has become subjected to an ever more serious negative imbalance which has led to the state of the world we see today. Lucifer has"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"24 sought to control the information and thought patterns of the dense physical level to such an extent that whoever incarnated on to the Earth would become subjected to those patterns and to the influence of the people already affected by them. A simple example of this is can be found in parents controlled or strongly influenced by the Lucifer thought patterns who indoctri nate their children to think in the same way. Once control of the human mind has been largely accomplished at the collective level, each successive generation has faced pressure to conform to that way of thinking. Every species has, as I have outlined, a collective mind, a level to which all minds in incarnation are linked. It has been shown that, once a certain number of a species learns to do something new, suddenly other members of the same species are able to do the same thing without being shown. This so-called ‘Hundredth Monkey Syndrome’ is the collective mind at work. Once enough individual minds start thinking in a particular way, their thought patterns become strong enough in the collective mind for other individuals to access that information. That’s how the Hundredth Monkey Syndrome works. With Lucifer transmitting thought patterns into the collective mind and using billions of dense physical bodies over the centuries to do the same, it is not difficult to see how the illusions and misunderstandings of humanity have arisen and become so powerful. There were three tasks which those who had come to the Earth needed to perform in order to restore harmony. One was to create a temporary energy grid on the planet to replace the one devastated during Atlantis; the second was to restore and re-open that Atlantis energy system when the time was right and re-awaken the closed- down energies before the Earth’s evolutionary leap during the present pass of the photon beam; and the third was to give humanity as much information as possible to help them to remember who they really were and what they had come to do. If it was difficult for humanity’s higher selves to communicate with them, this problem could be by-passed, to some extent, by using those who did maintain a good connection to bring information directly to this dense physical level. Also, everyone who changed their thinking in the light of this information would be sending thought patterns into the collective mind to challenge the Lucifer domination. These efforts were made more difficult by the way the frequency"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"25 had fallen and the nature of the imbalances it was subject to. On this frequency were negative emotions and mental states of a scale and severity that these evolved volunteers had never experienced directly before. If the personnel were to be capable of playing their part in those generations at the end of the 20th century, they had to have mastered, to a large extent, the emotions, temptations, illusions and fears so prevalent on the Earth. If they did not, they would be unable to do what was required and the transition period would be even more traumatic and difficult than it already promised to be. As well as coming into incarnation to pass on information and work on the energy grid, these beings also had to be put through lives that would give them experience of some very unpleasant emotions. Only in this way could they learn to overcome them. Sometimes they would have lives in which they worked almost exclusively on the energy system and on the spreading of information; sometimes they would have lives designed primarily to experience negative emotions and overcome them. Mostly their lives were a combination of both. Over the thousands of years since the destruction of Atlantis, those working for the restoration of the planet have been incarnating over and over again and, in that process, have been amassing karmic debt which has had to be balanced out. Some became so affected by the pressures of this level that they no longer followed the path they had embarked upon after Atlantis. They came to free the prisoners and ended up in jail themselves, trapped by the pressures and desires of the dense physical world and undermined by the Luciferic consciousness which seeks to stop the volunteers, in particular. Most of them have been historically anonymous, living simple lives and being guided to work on the energy system. Many of the great stone circles and the standing stones of the world were built either by, or under the direction of, these people. Pyramids and the stones are the physical manifestation of the work that went on thousands of years ago to construct a sort of makeshift energy grid to keep the Earth ticking over until the Atlantean one could be reactivated in our lifetimes. They would have sensed the energies and been guided to do what was required because the energy imbalances at that time were not as great as they would later become and the connection with the higher self would have been potentially more powerful. Also every effort is made by other levels to make the higher self/lower self connection of certain key people as strong as it can possibly be when particular particular tasks must be achieved."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"26 Pyramid geometry is such that it has a very significant effect on energy flows, negative or positive depending on how they are used, while the stone circles and standing stones act like fuse boxes and acupuncture needles receiving energies from the universal grid and rebalancing the flows. If you look back at any civilisation which was more evolved than the rest of the world, you will be looking at either a group incarnation of those who volunteered to help the Earth or at the effects of spaceship landings or channelled information which passed on the knowledge. That doesn’t mean that the volunteers were perfect. They were subject to the pressures of this world, also. And what is perfect, anyway? But they were in close enough synchronisation with their higher self for knowledge to reach this level which helped the earth and human understanding. When I say that the volunteer consciousness incarnated into certain civilisations, I don’t meaii that every member of that nation or race was that consciousness incarnate. Only some of them. These were the ones who accessed the information and understanding from higher levels which either helped those civilisations to evolve very quickly or challenged the political, economic and religious dogma of their day. Around them there would have been people who ignored them or killed them for their ‘heresy’ as well as those who listened and supported their views on how a society could best prosper in peace. That is the situation in its most simplistic form. But, of course, it is more complex than that. Some of the volunteer consciousness has become imbalanced and is either not working for the good of the planet or is actively working against it. Some of the Luciferic consciousness will have been so affected by its experiences that it has rejected that negative influence. In most cases, people are affected by both. No-one is all good or all negative. The question is which part of us is dominating our behaviour and to what degree? Extra-terrestrials continued to come to the Earth in this post- Atlantis period, and were considered to be gods by the Earth people. This is not surprising when you imagine what it must have been like for the primitive Earth people to be confronted by spacecraft and their occupants. We should not underestimate the scale of the influence on human evolution on all levels, positive and negative, by other civilisations in the Universe. When you look through the Bible and other ancient texts you can see what appear to be spacecraft described. The Book of Ezekiel is a prime example and, indeed, there is an analysis of this called The Space Ships Of Ezekiel by Josef F."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"27 Blumrich, a former chief of systems layout at NASA. His work strongly suggests that a number of biblical texts are describing spacecraft. Analysis of many ancient writings and the artwork of peoples all over the world also appears to contain de scriptions of such craft and their occupants, who were thought to be ‘gods from the sky’. Ancient Indian Sanskrit texts speak of gods who fought in aircraft and certainly the Book of Ezekiel leaves you in little doubt of what was being described: “Now as I looked upon the living creatures, I saw four wheels upon the ground, one by each ofthe living creatures, with their four faces. The appearance of the wheels and their composition was like the colour of shiny amber; and all four wheels had one likeness; and their appearance and their composition was like a wheel in the middle of a wheel... “And when the living creatures went, the wheels went with them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. “And the appearance of the sky upon the heads of the living creatures was reflected as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched over their heads above... “And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, like the din of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. And there was a voice from the crystal covering that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings.” Ezekiel 1:1-25 The Babylonians had a god called Oannes, a fishtailed amphibious being who, according to their legends, came to Earth to start a civilisation. Some people look at the primitive way of life on the planet during these periods and laugh at the idea of highly-evolved spacecraft landing here. But people from the computerised, technological, western culture today visit parts of the world that still live more or less as the ancients did. No-one finds that funny or hard to accept. The only difference between that and what I am suggesting about spacecraft is that, in the extra-terrestrial case, the technological culture visiting a more primitive one is interplanetary rather than intercontinental. We will pick up the story of what happened to humanity after"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28 Atlantis in the fertile land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers around 4,OOOBC. This area became known as Mesopotamia and is now Iraq. Here the Sumerian people settled and were supported by visitations from many extra-terrestrial peoples, some to help, some to exploit. The Sumerians were said to have built the first cities of the post-Atlantis era, but there were many other civilisations before that. One was in Israel, around Jericho, for sure. According to the Sumerian records preserved on baked bricks, they themselves came to the area with a knowledge of writing, the arts, agriculture and metalwork. I am sure that the knowledge contained in their writings and artifacts came to them from earlier civilisations that history hasn’t yet recorded. The Sumerians used their agricultural skills and the rich silt left by the rivers in times of flood, to grow two crops of wheat each year. A culture developed that was, as far as we know, well ahead of most of the planet at that time. A library of more than 30,000 written tablets was created and the discovery of some of these has given us an understanding of the Sumerian background and history. Some of the symbols found on Sumerian artifacts correspond with those in the crop circles that appear in the fields of southern England and elsewhere today. The two main cities of Mesopotamia were Eridu, the capital of Sumer, and Nippur to the North, the capital of Akkad, which was inhabited by a Semitic race. The two cities had very different religious beliefs and cultures. Eridu worshipped the God, Ea, while En4il was the God of Nippur. Later the Arabian word, Allah, would devolve from En4il, as would the Hebrew word for God, El, who was also to become the Christian God. I have no doubt that Ea and En-lil were extra-terrestrials from that earlier period we talked about. By now they had entered Sumerian legends as ‘gods’. Extra-terrestrials and the psychic channellings and visions which people experienced were the foundations of the religions that would follow, right up to the present day. Not all the gods came from these sources. Some were just made up or the product of confused minds but most were ET or psychic in their origins. Look at the implications for the Bible and other ‘holy’ books of the themes emerging in our story so far. The judgmental god so widely quoted in the Old Testament and other ancient texts, who threatens to bring horrors upon human beings if they don’t do as he tells them, merely reflects the attitudes of the negative ETs or channelled entities. They are not the words of God but those of the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"29 extra - terrestrials and channelled entities who were thought to be gods. Go to church and worship an ET! The idea that God created humans in his own image would describe perfectly the seeding of the human form as we know it by extra-terrestrials considered to be gods. I stress here that, when truths were passed on, they were communicated in ways which the people of the time could understand. From the symbolic explanations of thousands of years ago have come the religious dogmas as the symbolism has been taken literally and added to or changed around. When ancient texts say clearly, ‘This story is a parable’, religions accept the tale as symbolic but many take everything else in the text literally. In fact, most of these texts are symbolic and told in parable form. I use a lot of symbolic explanations in my books which relate to what people today experience and easily identify with. It has always been like that. So there are still truths in the Bible and many other ancient texts despite what the religions have done to destroy and debase them. But these truths and the mathematical codes they also contain will never be understood if they continue to be taken literally rather than symbolically; nor while the religions continue to proclaim that everything written in them is one hundred per cent accurate and the infallible word of God when a goodly proportion is clearly invented claptrap passed on from one people to another through the centuries. Religious dogma and myth have been used very successfully either to suppress understanding or to twist the truth sufficiently to turn something positive into something negative. The story of Adam and Eve is an example. It has been used to undermine women (Eve tempts Adam in the story to eat from the Tree of Knowledge against the command of God, and so evil starts with the creation of women). It has also been used to justify the belief that we are all born sinners (our ancestral lines are all supposed to go back genetically to the original ‘sinners’, Adam and Eve). This nonsense is still blindly followed today to justify some terrible behaviour. My goodness. God help us! To weave a way through this minefield we have to look at the symbolism in the Sumerian stories and other ancient texts but not take them all literally. Even the symbolism is multi-dimensional. I don’t believe the symbolism of the snake, for example, relates entirely to the Garden of Edinnu or Eden. I feel that the snake or serpent has been used as a symbol for many things. The"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"30 Mesopota mian culture had a serpent-god called Ningishzida represented by two intertwining snakes. These are possibly symbolic of the two opposing forces, positive-negative, male-female, in balance within the kundalini energy as it rises through the central channel to connect and empower the chakras on the physical level. Appropriately, though somewhat ironically, the symbol of the medical profession to this day is the two intertwining snakes known as the caduceus. The symbol of modern medicine represents knowledge of the physical body and the human energy field known thousands of years ago, but now rejected by the very profession which has that knowledge in its symbol! Serpents and similar symbols have also been used throughout ancient cultures to represent the Goddess or female polarity of Creation. The earlier concepts of the Trinity had a female symbol as one of the triangle of’gods’ while the more enlightened religions speak of a Father/Mother God to highlight the need for male-female balance within both ourselves and the whole. The Christian version of this idea of a Trinity - Father, Son and Holy Ghost -does not recognise the feminine and that has been reflected in its attitude to women over the centuries. All the ancient and more spiritually enlightened cultures like the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the native Americans (Indians), the Australian aborigines and many of the East, knew of the importance of the kundalini and had initiations, often very tough ones, to speed the smooth activation and empowerment of these energies. The snake and serpent were, more often than not, a representation of this. Similarly, their belief in resurrection or rebirth was often symbolised by the snake shedding its skin as it moved from one state of being into another. There were some periods of peace in Sumer, but it was also plagued by inter-city battles and, gradually, the civilisation decayed and disappeared. This was to be a running theme through human evolution - the desire to impose beliefs or to steal the benefits of an advanced culture, causing war after war and, thereby, destroying what human ingenuity and the volunteer consciousness had created. It is also the case, as we will discuss more thoroughly later, that if you wish to control people and stop them evolving spiritually then causing conflict between them is an excellent way to achieve that aim. The culture of the Sumerians was to influence others who began to develop in the region we call the Middle East. Sumerian beliefs and knowledge found their way to the Egyptians, Babylonians,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"31 Assyrians, Hebrews and, later, the Greeks. In turn, the Greeks would influence the Romans and the Sumerians could fairly be said to have been the foundation of much that would follow. Writing and such architectural constructions as the arch and the dome first appear with the Sumerians in the post-Atlantis period although these probably go back further to preSumer times. The Hebrews inherited many of their own beliefs from Mesopotamia and Egypt and these have been passed on through the generations as Judaism and, eventually, Christianity. The idea of the Sabbath comes from the Sumerians as does the Great Flood, the Fall of Man and the laws that have been associated with Moses. One Sumerian tablet records the story of Creation which, in all its main themes, is the same as that reported in Genesis. The God myths, largely, though not entirely, the result of ET and psychic activities, were already well underway by Sumer times. Another Sumerian tablet tells the story of Bel, which means the Son of God. Bel was to become the saviour-myth figure of Babylon and would be known to the Hebrews as Baal. Bel, the Sumerian son of God was the Lord Christ and redeemer in Babylonian thought. They believed he had died and risen again to ensure their salvation. Heard that somewhere before? The Babylonians performed a Passion drama and sang hymns that were very close to the Passion plays and services of the later Christians. Bel was the second in a trinity of gods - Ea, the Father; Bel, the Son, and Anu, the Holy Spirit. It was the custom to sacrifice a lamb to the gods because, as one tablet says, “The lamb is the substitute for humanity.” What is it that the Bible tells us? “...the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world.” The ‘lamb’ of the Bible is said to be Jesus, but that’s just a piece of myth-recycling. The basic story of Bel and other key elements of this Sumerian and Babylonian belief-system were taken back to Judea by the Jews after they were freed from captivity in Babylon. They then found their way into the texts that make up the Old Testament and, through them, into the New Testament. So we have the Bible talking ofJesus as the Lamb of God dying so that our sins can be forgiven or, as they were saying thousands of years earlier in Mesopotamia during their animal sacrifices, ‘The Lamb is the substitute for humanity’. One Sumerian tablet even records the story of how Sargon, the King of the Semites, was hidden by his mother in a basket made from bulrushes on the bank of the Euphrates, a tale attributed in the Bible"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"32 to Moses. As we will see, the whole basis of the Jewish, Christian and many other religions comes from stories inherited over the centuries which each religion attributes to its own particular saviour- god. A number of these stories and myths will be symbolic of actual events and eternal truths but their meaning, in most cases, has become so changed, twisted or embellished that the understanding has been lost. I am not sure how much direct ET involvement went on in Sumer. I want to see more information before I decide what I feel was happening. Obviously this part of the book, in terms of the ET involvement, has to be a hypothesis, although one based on much research by a number of people. It is possible that ETs were still making themselves known to the population as a whole, or it could be they were interacting only with certain groups or individ uals. But I don’t think it is as simple as ETs manifesting physically. I feel they operate mostly on other frequencies of reality which allow them to be seen only by those who can psychically tune into them. They would certainly have been working through human consciousness and channellers, I would say, and having a considerable influence on events. What I do feel on the balance of the evidence I have seen and my own intuition, is that the principle of initiating people into the eternal truths began to be misused from at least this Sumer period onwards and probably much earlier. If you remember, the channelling in the last chapter talked about the “Guardians of the Light” in Atlantis being given the knowledge of how to use and harness the energies. This knowledge was kept secret because of the potential for devastation if it was misused. At that time this initiation process was used with the best of intent. This process was, however, to become infiltrated under the influence of the Luciferic Consciousness and slowly, but surely, it spawned the enormous network of secret societies we see today, all with similar terms, symbols, and initiation proceedures. This network I will call the Brotherhood. I stress here that I am not suggesting all secret societies from this moment on were of negative, manipulative, intent. Many continued to use the cover of secrecy in the centuries that followed, to pass on spiritual knowledge which was being systematically destroyed in the outside world, and to speak openly about it would have been tantamount to suicide. The Brotherhood, where used to communicate the spiritual truths for the good of humanity in line with its original"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"33 purpose, has made a vital contribution to keeping those truths alive through some very dark times. So it is no contradiction that some great people who have served humanity well have been involved in Brotherhood secret societies, while the Brotherhood has also been used to manipulate humanity appallingly. It depends who is in control of the secret society at a particular time. What I most strongly contend, however, is that from now onwards there was a gradual takeover of the Brotherhood initiation process, until it became an overwhelmingly negative influence on humanity and an enormously effective vehicle for the Luciferic Consciousness. I shall be charting this takeover through the book and highlighting its fundamental effect today on everyone’s lives. The difference between the original Brotherhood and the Luciferic version is one of intent and method. The original passed on truths, or what were genuinely perceived to be truths, to those it believed would use the knowledge wisely; the Luciferic version gives a twisted and manipulated version of the truths to those it believes can be trusted to continue its ambitions to control the world. The Sumerian civilisation expanded and the famous city of Ur was built around 3,500Bc. Later, an event of some kind occurred which altered the course of the Euphrates and forced the people to move North to the river settlement known as Babylon, which means the Gate of the Gods. Internal strife weakened them and eventually the Amorites conquered the region and brought together Sumer and Akkad to form Babylonia. The Amorites were a Semetic race, a branch of which became the Hebrews. King Hammurabi became the ruler of what was to be known as Babylonia and he instigated a system of laws and justice that were to be adapted for their own use by the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. Education was available to all and everyone had the opportunity to learn to read and write. There were libraries and universities. It is important to appreciate, as we look at where present-day values and beliefs originated, that nothing is new. It is all inherited from, or influenced by, what has happened in the past. To say that the beliefs of Christianity were new 2,000 years ago is simply ridiculous. Even the Christian ceremony called the Eucharist, the eating of the body and the drinking of the blood, originates from the days of cannibalism. Today, Christians eat bread and drink red wine to symbolise Christ’s body and blood. In the ceremonies from which this originated, they ate and drank the real thing in human and animal"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"34 sacrifices! The Greeks called it the Eucharistia. The Assyrians travelled three hundred miles to the south to invade and conquer Babylonia around 1280Bc and, over the next 200 years or so, they extended their empire across to the Mediterranean. After a period of internal war, the Assyrians invaded Egypt, but this campaign so exhausted them physically and financially that they were conquered by the Chaldeans who moved their centre to Babylon. The best known of the Chaldean kings was Nebuchadnezzar who reigned from 604 to 561Bc and it was he who invaded through Judea to take command of Egypt. Jews were taken captive and removed to Babylon where they were to have access to the stories of Bel, the Son of God, and the other Mesopotamian beliefs I have been talking about. The next conquerors on the scene were the Persians who took Babylonia in 539Bc. The Jews believed these invaders had been sent by their God, Jehovah, to free them from captivity when, in fact, like so many other peoples, the Persians merely wished to extend their empire and steal all the booty they could find. The Jews had supported the Persians in their attack on Babylon and were allowed to return to Judea. They took with them the stories and beliefs they had heard in Babylon and this was to be a great influence on the emergence of both the Jewish and Christian religions. The Persians had a belief in one God in contrast to the many-god religions that abounded among those people who believed that different gods were responsible for every facet of nature and the many ET and other ‘gods’ which became myth figures over the centuries. So, when all those ‘gods’ became fused into the one God, he was an amalgamation of all those different myths and beliefs. No wonder the Bible is so contradictory. By 500Bc the Persians controlled an area from Egypt to the borders of India. Communications improved with the building of the royal road from near the Persian Gulf almost to the Aegean Sea and Greeks began to travel south to visit Babylon. There they heard the stories of Bel and others and met with people from India and Syria. Their knowledge and beliefs were exchanged and the fusion of myths continued apace."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"35 3 A Brotherhood of Clans EGYPT was another major influence on the pre-Christian world. The name means ‘black land’ and refers to the silt left by the flooding Nile. Like Sumer, this civilisation grew from settlements alongside a major river where the fertility of the soil would ensure that there was enough to eat. Researchers believe the land was settled before 3,000BC and developed into a system of Pharaoh dynasties and dictatorships. There are some who believe that extra-terrestrials were very active in this region, at least in the early days, and while I would like to see more information before I accept they actually lived among the people, I have no problem in accepting that the culture was seriously influenced, either by legends and myths originating from ET activity, or by the direct appearance ofspacecraft and their occupants. If you look at many of the statues, artwork, and face make-up from early Egypt and Mesopotamia, they often emphasise large eyes. There are several civilisations elsewhere in the Universe which have very large eyes when compared to ours. I am sure that some Egyptian ‘gods’ were extraterrestrial in origin and the Egyptians said that these ‘gods’ went into the sky in their flying boats. There is a view among some researchers which says that ETs, some with a human-like form, came regularly to the Earth in these ancient times and began the tradition of God-kings in many civilisations which, in Egypt, manifested as the Pharaohs. It is said that these kings were the human extension of negative extra-terrestrial control and that the whole idea of a monarchy came from their wish to manipulate humanity. The Pharaohs and kings were, according to this theory, persuaded that they were different from the rest of humanity and the representatives of the gods (ETs) on earth. In fact, this belief system contends, the monarchs were puppets being used by some"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"36 space people to keep the masses in ignorance and spiritual imprisonment. The monarchs, too, were conned and indoctrinated, it is said. I don’t know and have no way of knowing if there is any truth in this, but I offer it to you as information only and make of it what you will. I’ve put it all on the back burner for now with a great deal else. One highly significant Pharaoh was Amenophis IV. About five years into his reign he adopted the name Khu-n-aten and is now knows as Akhenaten. He abolished idols and the traditional multi-god religion and moved the capital from Thebes to a new city in Middle Egypt called El-Amarna. A Brotherhood temple was built there in the shape of a cross and he established the simple worship of the Sun God, Aten. Perhaps he realised the true significance of the Sun as a source of knowledge and guidance, or possibly he was used by the Brotherhood to create a new one-god religion. Some researchers see him as a tool of the Brotherhood infiltrators who misled his people. Maybe he was. I don’t know the truth about him. Anyone can be manipulated; that is particularly true when you have left this physical level and can no longer challenge what is said and done in your name. Look at the man we call Jesus! And as I keep stressing, secret societies can be used for good or ill - it depends on who is in control and what the society is they are operating in. The French Resistance in the Second World War was a secret society in a sense. You can’t be black and white on this as some researchers are. For instance, I believe that Akhenaten was right, there is only one God, one overall consciousness, but that doesn’t mean that I agree with everything else he believed. We have to be selective and free ourselves from rigid dogma. What I do feel is that at least after the time of Akenaton the infiltration of the Brotherhood and it’s expansion did gather pace. When Akhenaton died in about 1362Bc his successors moved the court back to Thebes and reinstated the multi-god religions. One successor had a preference for the cult of the god Amen or Amun and he changed his name from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun. He was to become world-famous thousands of years later when his tomb was uncovered in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor. Akhenaton was to be branded a heretic. While the court was moved back to Thebes, the Brotherhood and its Mystery School of secret initiations stayed put. It used the temple built by Akhenaton as its headquarters and, in doing so, broke away from the state hierarchy. From El-Amarna, agents of the Brotherhood were sent out to set up other branches far"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"37 and wide. I believe that from this point, the Egyptian Brotherhood was probably working with less than positive intent and the expansion of the inflitrated, Luciferic version would now begin to spread its influence and manipulation. Each of the Brotherhood priests at El-Amarna had a bald spot and wore a cord around his robe, tied at the loins. This mode of appearance was later to be adopted by many other orders such as the Franciscan monks in Christian times. The Mystery Schools were a vehicle to pass on the secret knowledge and for the use of hallucinogenic drugs, sexual orgies or rites, and human sacrifice was not unknown either, depending on who controlled them. Mind control techniques were well understood. Offshoots of the Brotherhood began to emerge, particularly from these Egyptian and Babylonian times. Each had the same secret codes, symbols and initiations. No one in these secret societies is allowed to know what is going on at the level above them and this is an extremely effective means of manipulation which has been used through the ages. Such organisations continue to this day with names like the Freemasons, Knights Templar, the Order of the Knights of St John, the Order of the Quest, the Knights of Malta, the Jesuits. The Brotherhood is now almost completely under the control of the negative consciousness, the Round Table and countless others. The names may have changed and the number increased enormously since ancient times, but the agenda remains the same. I am not saying that every member of these societies is knowingly working against the good of humanity. Certainly not. Most of them will not have a clue of how their society is being used. What I am saying is that those groups and others are being controlled by people who are seeking to continue and complete the ‘Great Work of Ages’ - the takeover of the planet and the human mind. How they propose to complete that task we will see later. One of the most active Brotherhood organisations today are the Freemasons and they would seem to have their origins in Sumer and Egypt in the guilds of the stonemasons and craftsmen. These guilds copied many of the Brotherhood and mystery school traditions and initiations. The title Grand Master, which is common to most secret Brotherhood branches, was already being used at this time. Later, these guilds would evolve into freemasonry which is open to anyone considered acceptable (not just masons) and has been a front for some outrageous behaviour and manipulation. It aims, like the whole infiltrated Brotherhood through the centuries, to keep spiritual"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"38 knowledge from the general population (the basis of that set out at the start of this book) and even twist the version it gives to its initiates.

Five thousand years after ancient Egypt, Albert Pike, the Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of Freemasonry in America, would describe this secret society as: “The Custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories.” It is often asked who are the ‘they’, the elite that researchers speak of in relation to the conspiracy to control the human race. How can such an ambition possibly have spanned thousands of years? As Pike said, the knowledge and the agenda is handed down through the generations. ‘They’ are people who have been accepted into the highest levels of initiation by the infiltrated Brotherhood societies. At any point in history over the last 5,000 years those accepted into the highest degrees have continued the Great Work, while looking for those with the potential to take over from them. So while the personnel change, the agenda and methods have remained very much the same. Only those considered certain to continue the work and keep it secret are accepted in the elite levels. One way potential “adepts” have been tested is by telling them to spit on the cross. Those who refuse are congratulated for their commitment to serve God and reject such heresy. But they are never subsequently considered for promotion, because they cannot be trusted with the knowledge of the real agenda. Those who do spit on the cross are the ones who go on up the ladder because, among other things, they do as they are told. It is part of the Freemasons’ mythology that human civilisations were begun by visitors from the star Sirius which they connect with the Egyptian goddess, Isis. Sumerian stories record that these ETs were fish-like in their appearance - the ‘Oannes’ I mentioned before - and that they passed on information about building, spiritual symbolism, science and arts. The Egyptians certainly acknowledged the importance of Sirius to them. The Freemasonic and Brotherhood symbol of the pyramid with the capstone depicted as the all-seeing eye goes back to these ancient times, this is said to represent the eye of Sirius - although I see it as Lucifer. The Dogon people in Mali, in sub-Saharan Africa, have had a legend, probably originating in"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"39 Egypt, which has been passed on over five thousand years. It tells of a star that they claimed orbited Sirius. They knew it as the smallest and heaviest of stars containing the germs of all things and the Dogons said that it weighed so much that ‘all the Earthly beings combined cannot lift it’. The legend further claims that it took fifty years for the star to orbit Sirius. All this is remarkable when you think that the star they have known about for thousands of years was not officially discovered until the last century and was photographed for the first time in 1970. It has been named Sirius B, and the Dogons have been proved correct in their claims. For it does take around fifty years to complete an orbit and scientists have suggested that one cubic foot of Sirius B matter would weigh 2,000 tons. Obviously, Sirius is of considerable relevance to what has been happening on this planet. How could Earth people know such details unless they were told by those who knew? Extra-terrestrials or highly accurate channelling? Freemasonry, like most secret societies of the infiltrated Brotherhood, bases its beliefs and aims on the worship of the Sun God and Mother Goddess mythology which it is believed was common to ancient civilisations. This Father/Mother belief was reflected in the Egyptian trinity of gods - Osiris, the father, Isis, the mother, and Horus, the son. Another name often used for the Brotherhood is its Latin name, the Illuminati, or ‘illuminated ones’. It may sound fantastic at this stage in our story, but the world is controlled today by a Brotherhood of secret societies which go back to this period. The swastika, the lamb, the obelisk, the apron, which some Egyptian gods are depicted as wearing, and of course the pyramid and eye are still the symbols of the Brotherhood societies. Thousands of years after ancient Egypt you can find the pyramid and eye symbol very easily in America. It forms the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States and appears on every dollar bill. The truths pedalled by the negative secret societies have been twisted enough to mislead their members. I feel the Egyptian beliefs have been misrespresented to an extent, but, as one researcher said so correctly, it doesn’t matter if what they believe is true or even if you believe it. As long as they believe it, we are all affected by the way their thinking influences their actions. Channelling was at the centre of the Egyptian culture and could be used to control or, as it was in many cases, to gather knowledge that was not being made available from elsewhere. Just as the Luciferic consciousness wishes to control people, so the conscious ness of ‘The"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"40 Light’ wishes to set them free by allowing them access to the spiritual truths that are being denied them. Channelling is an important way of doing this. This is one reason why, despite the efforts of the manipulators, many people in Babylon and Egypt had more spiritual knowledge than either the ETs or the elite wanted them to know. Channellers were widely consulted as a source of divine inspiration and there were rooms called the holy of holies or sanctuaries where inter-frequency communications took place. These were built on energy points where a ‘god’ (a discarnate consciousness in this case) could communicate most effectively. This is how the prophets in the Bible got their information. Those in the Christian Church who equate channelling with devil worship should know that the term prophet comes from the Greek word which means medium! In the early Egyptian period, some worshipped the Sun god Ra, and others followed the god Amun or Amen. These two later became fused into one, Amun or Amen Ra. After their prayers and religious teachings they would say the name of their god. This was passed on through Judaism into Christianity and, in churches all over the world today, Christians still end their prayers and readings with the word ‘Amen’. How many know that, in doing so, they are saying the name of a Pagan god of channelled or extraterrestrial origin, just as the Egyptians did? Amen also represents a sound, by the way, that resonates a certain frequency known to the ancients. Egyptian mythology had a trinity of gods in Osiris, the father, Isis, the mother, and Horus, the son. The Egyptians believed that Osiris came to suffer so that those who believed in him would live. He was known as Lord of Eternity, the Judge and Saviour of the human race, the Resurrection and the Life, the Bread of Life, the Redeemer and Mediator who would decide the eternal fate of heaven or hell for the dead. Horus was portrayed sitting on his mother’s knee and, from this, the idea of the Madonna and child was to emerge in Christianity. The Egyptian figure of evil, Set, became the Christian version, Satan. The cross was an Egyptian symbol for thousands of years before it was adopted by Christianity and the Egyptians celebrated the festival of Easter, the day that Horus, the son, was said to have died and risen again to become one with his father. All this would have been influenced by the Babylonian belief in Bel and both would have begun with the same channelled communications or extraterrestrial influence. In fact, I think that most of this symbolism relates back to extra-terrestrial activities and the star systems they came from, and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"41 from the knowledge that the day was approaching when the forces of disharmony (Set, Satan, Lucifer etc) would be overcome by harmony. That time is now. The idea of a trinity of gods, or three gods in one, is a theme that runs through countless pre-Christian religions. The Christians merely copied it as they copied everything else. Some of the symbolism of the trinity is linked to energy balancing. The three points of the triangle stand for positive/negative/balance, and male/female/ balance. The triangle is a well-known esoteric symbol as is the double interconnecting triangle known as the Star of David. This represents the balance of the spiritual with the balance of the physical. Thousands of years before Christianity, dogmatic religious belief, based on the misunderstandings and twisted truths I have highlighted, was already being used by the Luciferic consciousness in its many guises to close down the potential of the human mind and to fill it with myths and the literal interpretation of symbolic stories. The fear of the gods and the horrors that would be visited upon those who did not do as they were told was a very effective way of keeping the masses from the knowledge of their true selves. The god kings of the various cultures and the gathering power of the priests as interpreters of the gods’ desires added to the expansion of the religious dogma and control. The Egyptian elite were an advanced people for their time in many ways, although they kept most of the population in physical and spiritual slavery. They performed operations - mummies have been found with well-set fractures and false teeth. It was to be many thousands of years before anything like this appeared in Europe. Educated Egyptians understood the principles of astronomy and astrology, as did the Babylonians. Astronomy and astrology were seen as indivisible sciences. The richer Egyptians lived in beautiful homes with elegant furniture and artwork. In England, three thousand years later, some Christian clergy were still condemning the use of knives and forks as the work of the devil. The culture and belief systems developed in Mesopotamia and Egypt possibly under the influence of extra-terrestrials and channelled sources were to have a fundamental impact on all that followed. India was also developing a distinct culture in the preChristian world but, again, the basis of the Hindu religion was inherited from the West when Aryan peoples invaded around 1500BC"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"42 and turned the Indians into their servants. The gods of India, therefore, have a somewhat familiar ring. The father god of the Hindus is Brahma and he is part of a trinity of gods which includes Krishna, their version of the Jesus-type figure. Krishna is the Hindu saviour (see Bel, Osiris, etc). He is said to have lived around 1,000BC and is still revered today in much the same way as Jesus. The texts from which Hinduism was created are called the Vedas and in them you can find references which appear to record extra- terrestrial activities. Hinduism was a religion introduced by the invaders to create a strict system of hierarchy known as castes. It was a means to divide and rule. The religious apartheid which Hinduism promotes with its castes, taboos and impositions is a continuing confirmation, as with most religion, that large areas of incarnate humanity are yet to evolve from spiritual childhood. But, if you want a system of control, it’s wonderful and it is being used in that way today just as it was by the Aryans. Missionaries from the Egyptian Brotherhood also arrived in India during and after the invasion and, as a consequence, its power began to expand rapidly. India is, today, a major centre of Brotherhood activity. Five hundred years after the physical life claimed for Krishna came Gautama Buddha which translates as Guatama the Enlightened. Today he is known simply as Buddha and, in his name the, religion of Buddhism has flourished. Buddha was born in India into a royal family. He was a prince, but he gave up this privilege and wealth to spread his philosophy which incorporated reincarnation and an ethical way of life based on peace and love. I don’t agree with all that he believed in but there is much that I can easily support. He spoke out against the priests of the day and encouraged the pursuit of truth, wisdom and knowledge. He talked of a universal brotherhood (the positive variety!) and equal rights for men and women. Buddha spoke simple truths. He had no desire to be turned into some saviour- god or to be worshipped by followers who complicated his simple philosophy with additions, ceremonies and hierarchies. All he stood for - and all we ever reall; need - are spiritual truths, not endless ‘isms’ to complicate them. After Buddha’s physical release, his beliefs became the dominant religion in India. In the third century, King Asoka would adopt Buddhism and send his representatives across the known world to promote its philosophy. They travelled as far as Alexandria in Egypt where it became diluted somewhat by the Egyptian idea of Osiris,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"43 Isis and Horus. The depiction of Horus in the arms of his mother, Isis, became Buddha in the arms of the goddess, Hatari. Buddhism was replaced by Brahmanism as the major religion in India, but it was accepted by other Eastern countries and has made significant inroads into other parts of the world. Buddha’s contribution to the raising of planetary consciousness was very successful. He is a wonderful example of how the volunteer consciousness seeks to work, with simple truths and no imposition. Hinduism was to become the state religion in India as the centuries passed and it was to do for Indian evolution what Christianity did in the West. It held back their mental and spiritual development for thousands of years. Confucius was another volunteer incarnation. He was born in about 551Bc in China. His real name was K’ung Fu-tze which meant Master K’ung but this became Latinised into Confucius. He worked as a schoolmaster and stressed ethical conduct and the importance of setting an example through one’s own behaviour. He was later a brilliant magistrate and Minister of Crime who argued vigorously for social reform. But, like many of his kind, his wisdom was acknowledged less in his lifetime than after his physical death. He died a disappointed man, believing he had failed to bring about the change of attitude he had hoped for. However, with his going he became a national hero and his words have been constantly quoted ever since. Sometimes, when we leave this level we can release an energy which can affect people long afterwards and those who tune to this energy field will begin to focus on what that person has done and said. One Confucian saying was, “what you do not like when done to yourself do not do to others”. This theme of ‘do to others what you would have them do to you’ is common to many religions and philosophies. Many claim it for themselves when it is really an eternal truth. If we all observed it in our everyday lives, what a different world it would be. In China, during the life of Confucius, there was another being of great evolution called Lao-tsze, from whom we get Taoism. His views were similar to those of Buddha but they, too, were complicated and devalued in the usual way by those who followed the ‘ism’ created in his name. The Chinese led the world in their greatest periods with their knowledge and creativity. They identified the energy grid of the Earth which they called Dragon Lines and they introduced a form of healing called acupuncture which balanced the flows in the energy grid of the human body."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"44 They also discovered the opposing forces which need to be kept in balance and called them the yin and the yang. Buddha, Confucius, Lao-tsze, Jesus: the list goes on. All these, and others like them, are aspects of consciousness who came into incarnation to bring to this frequency simple messages from higher frequencies in order to raise and awaken human consciousness from the bondage of religion, myth and ignorance. As superb psychic channellers who could access information and understanding from very high sources, they also channelled energies to the planet of immense power. In most cases, their later followers have turned them into saviour figures or people to be worshipped as mystical heroes. This has often polluted their philosophy on life into dogmas and creeds. They have also attributed to them sayings and experiences that either never happened or derived from myths, events and people of an earlier time or different location. It is the last thing they wanted or believed in when they walked this Earth, I feel. Before we leave the pre-Christian story in Europe and the East, we need to look at two other civilisations which have had a profound impact on human evolution, the Greeks and the Romans. Around the Aegean Sea, thousands of years before Christianity, there were incarnations of the volunteer consciousness. Some influenced people in the area where Athens was later built and helped to start the Mycenaean civilisation. Others incarnated on the island of Crete and became known as the Minoans. At Knossos on Crete you can still see the ruins of a magnificent palace called the Labyrinth. Without knowing its historical background, I went to Crete on holiday. When we visited Knossos I was guided by my intuition to bury in the ruins of the palace a large crystal I had been given in Glastonbury. The palace was clearly built on a strong earth energy point, as were most ancient palaces and temples. The ancients had a greater understanding of the nature of earth energies than those who came after them in the Christian era. Again, when I talk of volunteer incarnations, I don’t mean that they were the whole civilisation, only certain members of it. Sometimes they were listened to, sometimes ignored or even killed. The Mycenaeans worshipped a trinity of gods and their religious symbol was the cross. They were conquered by tribes of Aryan peoples who took control of the land we call Greece. They worshipped a god called Zeus. The Ancient Greeks (also known as the Hellenes) were not a nation as such in these early days. They were a series of independent"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"45 tribes and were only formed together into a nation when Philip of Macedonia took control in the 4th century BC . By then they had founded the original Olympics. The Greeks at this time did not have a state religion. People were allowed to worship whichever gods they felt right were right for them and they would consult the hundreds of ‘Oracles’ (channellers) who were available in the temples and shrines for guidance. Again, we see this misunderstanding between discarnate communicators and ‘gods’ which has caused so much confusion. The word ‘angel’ comes from the Greek angelos, meaning messenger. Angels were believed to be divine messengers. This pagan belief was encompassed into Christian doctrine. The Greeks produced some outstanding examples of the volunteer consciousness. In the 6th century BC, Xenophanes was suggesting that God was not a man but a mind which orders the Universe and is beyond human understanding. He said there was a unity of all things and ‘the all is one and the one is God’. Xenophanes challenged the belief that a god came to Earth and suffered so that our sins could be forgiven. As we have seen, this came from Bel, perhaps even earlier, and the sacrifice of the lamb. But, later, along would come Christianity to carry on that myth for another 2,000 years. The great Greek thinkers, who were unfortunately only in the minority, realised that the Universe is governed by mathematical law and consciousness of high evolution, and not by mythical gods. The period 600 to 300BC saw Greece at the height of its intellectual powers. Pythagoras and Thales travelled to Egypt to absorb its knowledge which they would use together with their own inspiration and research to become the first Greek scientists. Science comes from a Latin word meaning knowledge. Thales was the founder of Greek geometry, astronomy and philosophy while Pythagoras was a superb mathematician who said, as did Philolaus, that the earth revolved around the Sun. This was two thousand years before it became accepted wisdom. Pythagoras was a social and religious reformer who stood for truth and ethics in all things. He was a vegetarian by ethical choice. Healing was another aspect of Greek life which evolved rapidly in this period and Hippocrates became known as the Father of Medicine. Doctors still take the Hippocratic oath. He refused to accept the idea, prevalent until then, that illness was caused by sin or devils. Surgery developed, too, in Greece but Christianity would put an end to all that for around 1700 years"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"46 because they believed in the resurrection of the physical body. They did not want mutilated bodies being resurrected and, as Christian power grew, Greek and Roman hospitals and healing centres would be destroyed and their doctors killed or banished. The Greeks were the first people since Atlantis to make geography a science. They produced the first historians, they investigated the laws of physics and discovered the law of cause and effect. Democritus suggested that matter was made up of atoms two thousand four hundred years before modern science. Greece produced outstanding playwrights, artists and orators and created laws and forms of democratic government which have been the foundations of what we see today. The word democracy comes from Greece. The three greatest philosophers of this time were Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They did not know everything or get their knowledge right, and they were influenced to an extent by the culture around them. But here were three aspects of the volunteer consciousness who were, in so much of their understanding, thousands of years in advance of their time. Socrates was a medium who communicated with other levels and pursued truth, knowledge and understanding with unwavering determination. He talked in the market places and on street corners, propounding his views and questioning people in order to gain more knowledge. He said that a revolution of thought was the only way to a revolution of behaviour. Socrates was the first since Atlantis to explain scientifically the mystery of life. He taught that around the Earth were many mansions for the soul’. How close this is to the many mansions in my Father’s house’ in the Bible. He also said that those we contacted in these ‘many mansions were not supernatural gods but discarnate beings like us. Socrates was not popular with the priests who still had power despite the undermining of their credibility by these outstanding men. While they were tuning to extremely high levels of consciousness, the mass of the people were still influenced by ignorant priests. Socrates was accused of corrupting the young by propounding heretical ideas and was sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. This he did with great calmness and confidence, because he knew where he was going and he knew it was better than where he was. When asked by his friend, Crito, how he wished to be buried, Socrates replied, “Wherever you will, if only you can catch me. Is it not strange that, after all I have said to convince you that I am going to the society of the happy, you still think this body to be Socrates? To die and be released is better"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"47 for me. The execution of Socrates for speaking his mind was a rare happening in Athens, and it came during a period when the ideals of freedom of speech were temporarily forgotten. Normally, Greece, with its liberal attitude, provided a great contrast to other areas of the world where one could be murdered for the mildest questioning of those in power. Socrates had been allowed to speak freely until then. Indeed, freedom of speech, religion and politics were generally an accepted part of life except for the odd period when those ideals lapsed. Socrates must have said the wrong thing at the wrong time from the point of view of the authorities because his pupil, Plato, was later allowed to continue to speak in the same vein without losing his life. Plato was devastated by his friend’s death and left Greece to visit Egypt, Palestine, Italy and Sicily. He learned from the people and cultures he encountered while outlining his beliefs in virtue and justice wherever he went. Plato was a man of courage and spoke out against tyranny. He saw it as cowardice which, of course, it is. The King of Sicily was so outraged by this that he had Plato arrested and sold into slavery. Fortunately, he was bought by a supporter who gave him back his freedom. When you are here for the good of the planet and humanity, the other levels are always trying to protect you in times of danger. They work through others who are in close enough contact with their higher selves to be used as a means of communicating through their thoughts. In this case, Plato was bought by a supporter and not by someone who might have prevented all the wonderful work he had yet to do. Plato returned to Athens and founded a school of philosophy which was called the Academy. It was named after the garden in which it was built and, today, we still use the word academy for an educational institution. Those with open minds flocked to hear the Plato wisdom. Pupils were encouraged to think, question and look at everything with open, inquiring minds. Every opinion was welcomed. He said that things were not always what they appeared at first to be. Two thousand three hundred years ago he said the mind was the eternal part of us which could exist outside the physical body. Even today, our so called state-of-the-art science still hasn’t realised that the eternal mind and the brain are not the same and that consciousness can exist outside the body. Indeed, that is its usual state. Plato, incidentally, was apparently involved in the Greek mystery school of the time, which shows that not all of these"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"48 Brotherhood secret societies were negative. He passed on much information he gathered there. Just as Socrates taught Plato, so Plato taught Aristotle. I think that Aristotle was a reincarnation of the Socrates consciousness. Socrates helped Plato to awaken to his true self and, through reincarnation, Plato did the same for him later when he became the personality called Aristotle. You can see how reincarnation can allow a relatively few aspects of consciousness to have an ongoing affect on human thinking. When one of their physical lives ends, another begins, and the work continues in another body. I think the Luciferic consciousness works in exactly the same way. Aristotle was a genius of his time. He was well versed in chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, astronomy, botany, anatomy and psychology and was always searching for further understanding in all these subjects and more. Like Plato, he started a school. It was known as the Lyceum. He also inspired the foundation of the famous university at Alexandria where people could research and lecture without the diversions of the mythical gods promoted by the religions. The intellectual greatness of Athens withered during the Peloponnesian War when the Spartans and Corinthians combined with others to defeat the Athenians. The war lasted twenty-seven years and the pre-eminence of Athens was over. Within a few centuries of it being Christianised, the Church would burn all the writings of Plato, Aristotle and other Greek knowledge that came to light. They saw this human enlightenment as heresy against the Bible. But some of their work survived and would rise again to public attention after the Renaissance in Europe. The incarnations of the volunteer consciousness that propelled Athens into the centre of intellectual thought was extremely successful in raising understanding and would continue to affect the thinking of millions over the centuries. But the power of the Luciferic consciousness to control the minds of so many should not be underestimated. Its most important weapons are conflict, imposition and ignorance, and it would have been very determined to put an end to what was happening in Athens. The Lucifer-controlled human beings in the negative secret societies and elsewhere, always seek to stimulate conflict. The cause doesn’t matter as long as it happens. The wars that destroyed intellectual Athens and the pursuit of further knowledge would be repeated across the globe and over the generations, as the struggle between harmony and disharmony"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"49 increased in its intensity. Greek philosophy would influence the Romans. Around 1OOOBC some nomadic tribes settled alongside the River Tiber in what is now Italy. They called their settlement Latium, hence Latin. This language was the fusion of the Aryan tongue and the Celtic. It evolved through the interaction and inter-marriage of the Aryan speakers and the darker-skinned Iberia Celts. By 753Bc, a trading centre had been established near to seven hills and was named Roma. From this beginning was to come a vast empire which, at its peak, would encompass Spain, France (Gaul), Italy, Dalmatia, Macedonia, Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Libya, Numidia, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Cyprus, Egypt and most of Britain and Mesopotamia. This was achieved largely through violence and slaughter. The early Romans were governed by kings. They had a flirtation with a republic, though it could hardly be described as a democracy. The priests with their mumbo jumbo still held sway. There was a people’s forum, a sort of popular assembly called the Comita Tributa but, any time the priests said the gods did not wish it to take place, it had to be cancelled. The priests determined the wishes of the gods by examining the hearts and livers of sacrificed animals. They believed that the heart and liver were the seat of the mind and that, through them, the gods could speak to them. The chaotic republic was replaced by a series of Emperors. This began after the emergence of the most famous Roman of them all, Julius Caesar, who was born in 1OOBC. He was a military leader who fought, conquered, and terrorised most of Europe. For, despite all his gifts as an orator and general, he was a tyrant and a butcher. He had many enemies in Rome who feared and resented his growing power. Eventually, he invaded his own country. He crossed a stream called the Rubicon which marked the border between his province and the rest of Italy. He took control of Rome and her empire and, in time, gave himself the title Pontifex Maximus as head of the state religion. This title of the head of what was a pagan religion is now held by the Pope! Julius Caesar was seen by most of his subjects as a divine being, yet another god king. Caesar travelled to Egypt where he fell for the charms of Cleopatra whom he would later take to Rome. But, in 44Bc, he was murdered on the Ides (15th) of March by those who hated him for the power he had over them and the Empire. There followed a long series of emperors, most of them less than"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"50 wise and compassionate, but there were many good things about the Roman civilisation, too. Nothing is all good or all bad. Under the rule of Vespasian in the nine years from 7OAD a system of education was introduced which was influenced by the ideas and beliefs of Plato and Aristotle. He made his minister of education a Spaniard turned Roman citizen called Quintilian who much admired the Greek philosophers. He organised an elaborate system of schools in the Roman Empire which taught the virtues of liberty, justice and truth, while abhorring cruelty and oppression. If only they and their like in Greece had been allowed to flourish and grow, what a different world we would live in today. Instead, Christianity was to cast its darkness across the Roman Empire and beyond. The schools were closed and their teachers scattered or killed because the pursuit of knowledge outside the pages of the Bible was seen as heresy. The great library at Alexandria was turned into a theological college and darkness and delusion descended on the collective mind of the human race. So, in our story, we have been through two distinct phases of human history. There were the times when extra-terrestrials popu lated the planet. Then, after the end of Atlantis, fewer of them came here but they still landed, and were seen by the people as gods. Channelling and psychic communications became the means through which the ‘gods’ most influenced us. ETs working for the Light - the great majority - and the Light Consciousness, have, in general, been working through the volunteers and any humans who wish to hear their message of love and spiritual freedom. But the Light will not interfere in human free will while the Luciferic stream has no such ethics. It has used whatever means necessary to create conflict, confusion and ignorance. All three of which bring to mind what has been one of Lucifer’s most effective vehicle for suppressing knowledge, understanding and mental liberation. It was his invention and it has served his cause so wonderfully well. Only today, nearly two thousand years later, are we beginning to cast off the yoke it has imposed on human evolution. It is the tragedy we call Christianity."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"51 4 Bible Stories The story of the Jews is woven through the early Middle Eastern cultures. About eighteen centuries before Christianity some event caused the Euphrates to change its course and bypass the Sumer city of Ur. No more could the land around the city be irrigated by an extensive system of ditches, nor could their ships reach the sea to trade. The inhabitants moved inland to settle alongside the river at Babylon. Abraham of the Old Testament left the city of Ur with his family and slaves. Among them was his nephew, Lot. According to Hebrew scriptures they settled in Syria (an abbreviation of Assyria) which they called Canaan. This name was later given to the whole area west of the Jordan, including what became Palestine. They led a nomadic life with their animals and at one time they travelled to Egypt in search of food during a famine. Abraham was much impressed by what he saw in Egypt and he took this knowledge of their beliefs and customs back to Canaan. He became a wealthy and influential man and used his hundreds of armed slaves to support various factions in the wars between Canaanite communities. Abraham fathered two children late in his life by two women, Hagar and Sarai, and they were named Ishmael and Isaac. It is quite possible, given his advanced age, that they were fathered by a younger man or men. It was now that Abraham introduced circumcision which he had seen used in Egypt. Abraham’s idea was to create a distinction between the followers of his God and the other peoples of Canaan. They worshipped the Sumerian god, Enlil, which became known as Allah or El. It was originally a Sun god, though almost certainly with extra-terrestrial origins, and they would have thought they were communicating with this being through their channellings. With the death of Abraham, his son Isaac became head of the family and he had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. The family and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"52 its offshoots were still nomads, but rich ones by the standards of the time. Jacob, the story goes, fathered twelve sons and the one he called Joseph was sold by jealous brothers to travelling merchants in the desert. Joseph was taken by them to Egypt where he was sold into slavery, but later he would become a favourite of the Pharaoh. This may sound far fetched at first, but Egypt was then ruled by Bedoum invaders, the Hyksos or ‘Shepherd Kings’. They were the same race as Joseph, the Arab nomad, and they had a similar culture. Joseph was made prime minister and put in charge of food production in Egypt. When ten of his brothers were driven to Egypt by famine they were reunited. Joseph was known as Israel, which means ‘El (God) does battle’ and his family and descendants would be called Israelites. The twelve sons ofJacob grew into twelve tribes. The so-called House ofJoseph, the slave-turned prime minister, took a different course to the others. The Israelites settled in an area called Goshen on the Eastern side of Lower Egypt, and over the next four hundred years or so they became a nation. All was well for them while the Shepherd Kings reigned in Egypt, but when they were removed by rebellion life became tough for the Israelites. They were disarmed and put to work as slaves. The Egyptians decreed that all male children of the Israelites should be killed and the intention was that soon the Israelite nation would cease to exist. Around the thirteenth century BC the man known as Moses was born and, it is said, was brought up by a Pharaoh’s daughter after he was found floating in a basket in the bulrushes. The story goes that he killed an Egyptian for badly treating an Israelite and fled into the desert of Sinai. There he learned more of Allah, the God of Abraham, and he had what appeared to be profound psychic experiences and communications. To this had to be God and not just a discarnate entity. Either that or he was contacted by extra-terrestrials or subjected to some sort of mind-suggestion. Some of the descriptions in the Bible of this god of Moses could certainly be space craft of some kind. It is worth pointing out, too, that ET technology can project three dimensional images we call holograms which appear to be visions. The craft need not be seen when this is happening and ‘miracles’ like a burning bush would be easy for ETs to manifest. Anyway, whatever it was that happened to Moses, his experiences led him to reject the Egyptian trinity of gods, Osiris, Isis, and Horus, and turn to Allah or El, the ‘One God’. Interestingly, Moses would surely"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"53 have attended the Broth erhood Mystery School in Egypt given his royal connections and they were promoting the idea of one God at least from the time of Akhenaten. It has been stressed to me in channelling that we should not underestimate the knowledge of hypnosis and mind-controlling drugs available in the mystery schools at this time. On the death of the Pharaoh, Moses returned to Egypt where he told the Israelites that Allah had appeared to him in the desert. The god had said they were his chosen people. He said further that Allah wished to be known by the Israelites as Yhuh, which was pronounced ‘Yarweh’ and later became Jehovah. This means ‘Rain Cloud’. From now on all the Israelite channellers were thought to be vehicles for the god Jehovah and the promises made to them through these sources were believed to be the promises of their god. It was the same with other peoples the world over and this is how many god-myths originated. As Luke’s Gospel says: “He [God] spake from the mouth of his holy prophets (channellers) which have been since the world began.” When you look at the communications Moses was supposed to have had with Jehovah on Mount Sinai you can relate it to the communications on Mount Olympus which the Greeks claimed to have had with their god, Zeus. The same themes run through all of them. Moses told the new Pharaoh of his communications and asked for permission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt to the land of Abraham in Canaan, the ‘promised land’ which ‘God’ had told him about. The Pharaoh eventually agreed and the great exodus began. They took with them the mummy ofjoseph and walked across the Red Sea by a sand bar which Napoleon I was also later to use. On the journey, it is said, Moses was given by ‘God’ the laws of his tribe which are known as the Ten Commandments with all those ‘Thou shalt nots’ and such like. Perhaps he channelled them or maybe he just thought he was channelling them because similar laws could be found in other areas of the Middle East. Maybe he met with the occupants of a spacecraft. As the biblical description says: “On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud appeared on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet was heard. (Jehovah often arrived with the sound of trumpets.) All the people in the camp trembled with fear. “Moses led them out of the camp to meet God and they stood at the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"54 foot of the mountain. The whole of Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord had come down on it in fire. The smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and all the people trembled violently.” Exodus 19: vv 16-18. Imagine what it would be like for that ancient people, or even people today, to see a spacecraft land on a mountain top and you can appreciate what might have been happening on Mount Sinai. The fierce, harsh, and bloodthirsty God of the Old Testament would fit with the theme of extremely negative extra-terrestrials who sought to control people on Earth through fear and imposition. Exodus goes on: “When the people heard the thunder and the trumpet blast and saw the lightening and the smoking mountain, they trembled with fear and stood a long way off. They said to Moses, ‘If you speak to us, we will listen; but we are afraid that if God speaks to us, we will die’. ‘Moses replied, ‘Don’t be afraid; God has come only to test (freighten) you and make you keep on obeying him, so that you will not sin’. But the people continued to stand a long way off and only Moses went near the dark cloud where God was.” Exodus 20: vv 18-20 This constant mention of a cloud in relation to Jehovah’s appearances is interesting, given also that his name means rain cloud’. Producing clouds is not problem for ET technology and indeed the elite Brotherhood scientists of today have the technology to manipulate the weather, at least in a small area. I have no doubt that some event happened on Sinai, but I am not convinced that Moses was given all the Thou Shalt Nots at that time. It is most likely that the whole story of the commandments is a myth and the laws of the Israelites did not come through Moses on the mountain at all. There are many similar stories shared by different civilisations and each claims them as their own when all they have done is change the names involved. The religious dogma and ceremonies of the Israelites were naturally influenced by the Egyptians as you would expect given that they had all been brought up in that country. The clothing of their priests was inspired by Egypt. Incidentally, during the journey, the Israelites had periods of hunger and thirst, obviously, as they walked through the desert lands. According to the stories they"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"55 were helped by manna from Heaven. I have seen this portrayed as bread falling from the sky. In fact, manna is a sticky substance produced by a desert shrub. It became obvious when they reached the ‘Promised Land’ of Canaan that the communications to Moses from whatever source had left something to be desired. Either that or his communicator was giving him some inaccurate information for some reason. They found well armed peoples in walled cities who resisted their advance. Moses had led them to believe that the promised land was unoccupied and waiting only for them. He was less than popular and the Israelites wandered in the desert for another forty years before they became fierce and barbaric warriors. Moses passed on and Joshua, a man of war, took over from him. The opposition in the promised land was still too much for them, but under the leadership ofJoshua they ejected the Arab shepherd peoples from a large area. This was to be called Palestine and here they settled down as an agricultural people with each tribe ruled by a sheik. They were still very primitive. They had only stone implements and they made animal sacrifices to Jehovah who was still being channelled, followed, and often seen in ways that could suggest ET involvement. Jehovah was always demanding animal sacrifices and he, or they, were clearly a deeply unpleasant piece of work under the control of the Luciferic Consciousness. To be circumcised by a sharp stone doesn’t bear thinking about, but that’s what happened. It was barbaric. There were occasions when some Israelites would turn away from the instructions ofJehovah and worship Baal - Bel, the Son of God of Mesopotamia. As time passed the attributes given to Jehovah and Baal began to merge. Around 1 150Bc, the prophet (channeller) Samuel came on the scene. The Israelites were now controlled by the Philistines and Samuel inspired a desire for liberty. Saul became king, against Samuel’s wishes, and he also took over his post of high priest. Saul turned his tribe ofJudah into the dominant force of the Israelites, defeating the Philistines and securing independence. Saul had a great rival in David and to escape Saul’s wrath David went into the desert ofJudea and lived the life of a criminal, murderer, and outlaw. Men, women and children were massacred by David and his band. Many were dismembered or burnt alive. He always consulted Jehovah before setting out to steal and kill and always received permission. You can see how any amount of slaughter can bejustified in the name of a god when you are either channelling a low"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"56 vibrational entity or deluding yourself with your own thoughts. Such is the story of religion. David became king when he and his bandits joined forces with the Philistines and conquered Judea. He then turned on, and defeated, the Philistines, taking Jerusalem in the process. It is from the word Philistine that Palestine came after this victory. David’s armies were merciless, often burning and dismembering their victims. His aggression and lust for power fuelled the expansion of his empire into Canaan, the rest of Syria, and Northern Arabia. He and the Israelites now controlled a region from the Euphrates to the Red Sea. So the Israelite Empire was born under the control of the House of Judah. We are now in the period up to 1015Bc. As Arthur Findlay points out in his outstanding work, The Curse of Ignorance, people were still being fined and jailed in Britain up to the last century for daring to criticise David and other Old Testament heroes who were believed to be vehicles for the righteousness of God. After David came his son Solomon, the man of ‘wisdom’ according to legend. In fact, he had no more respect for human life than had David. He killed his brother, the rightful heir under their laws, to become king in the first place. Solomon became an important member of the Brotherhood after he became an advisor to the Pharaoh, Shishak I, and married his daughter. While in Egypt he was initiated into the Brotherhood at El Amarna and when he returned to Jerusalem he built the famous temple to Jehovah which has been fought over ever since. It was a Brotherhood temple and Solomon invited the Brotherhood craft guilds of Egypt, the forerunners of the freemasons, to help with its construction. Many freemasons are led to believe that their organisation began with the building of Solomon’s temple and this has added to the myth that freemasonry is connected with the Bible, the Holy Land, and is in service to the ‘Great Architect of the Universe’ - God. In fact it goes back well beyond the time of Solomon and, in the case of its elite, it answers to a very different master. As Albert Pike, the Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of Freemasons in America would say in the 1870s: “The Masonic Religion should be by all of us initiates in the High Degrees maintained in the purity ofthe Luciferic doctrine.” They don’t tell the lower initiates that, however, until they have"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"57 agreed to submit themselves with a binding oath to the authority of their worshipful master who, according to the Mackey Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, must be obeyed as a first duty of every freemason. The secret brotherhood of Babylonia and Egypt was expanding rapidly as was its negative infiltration. It had already spread across other parts of the Middle East and one of its best known promoters was the Canaanite God-King, Melchizedek. His priesthood wore the famous brotherhood symbol of the apron, and combined it with another brotherhood symbol, the lamb, by making their aprons out of lamb skin. The freemasons still do this. The Brotherhood is also extremely strong and active in Israel and the Jewish culture in general today with its mystical expression, the kabbalah, also reflecting the classic practices of Brotherhood societies. The Order of Melchizadek is kabbalistic and promotes the philosophy of a world government which is the aim of the negative Brotherhood movement. Solomon’s temple was nothing more than a slaughterhouse with a stream of animals being sacrificed daily to gratify the perceived desires of Jehovah. A high priest and an army of 30,000 ‘lesser’ priests were supported by the contributions of the people to carry out this butchery. Their job had nothing to do with spirituality. They were nothing more than slaughterhouse workers. The priests, who were now taking over in their religion from the mediums and channellers as the accepted source of Jehovah’s will, announced that their god preferred the sacrifice of animals rather than crops and vegetation. The crops, you see, had to be burned as part of the sacrifice, but the animals only had to be killed and the priests then had the right to eat or sell the carcass. This same mentality was still alive in the 17th century when the first lighthouse was planned. Trinity House had been set up by Henry VIII for the Trinity Brethren, and their duty was to pray for the souls of people lost at sea. In return they were given the rights to everything salvaged from the ships wrecked on the English coast. When the Eddystone Lighthouse was proposed Trinity House opposed it because they could see that fewer wrecks meant less salvage for them. Under Solomon, Egyptian and Phoenician beliefs became absorbed into the Israelite worship ofjehovah and truths, half truths, myths, and lies were becoming merged as the centuries passed. When he died the Judean empire collapsed and the other tribes of Israel"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"58 revolted. Two distinct groups emerged, the Israelites in the north including Samaria and Galilee and those in Southern Judea who were called the Jews. The worship of Baal re-emerged to challenge that of Jehovah, but the prophets Elijah and more successfully, Elisha, made sure the worship of Baal was destroyed and Jehovah ruled supreme. Women were treated appallingly. They were bought and sold and when their husbands died they became part of his estate just like his cattle and land. Incest was common and children were sold, ill treated, and sacrificed; slavery abounded. The people of Israel believed they were God’s chosen people who would inherit the Earth, but a shepherd called Amos announced that he had communicated with Jehovah (the Lord) and he said their kingdom was to be taken from them. Even worse, Jehovah would lead the aggressors because the ‘chosen people’ had defied his instructions. Amos was right in that civil war broke out in 745Bc and the Assyrians took advantage to conquer the lands of Israel. The ten northern tribes began to disintegrate, a process the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks and Romans would complete. Amos, Hosea and other prophets steered the people away from the belief in a nationalistic god and weakened the power of the priests. They preferred to promote a gentler God of mercy andjustice who spoke for all people and not only the Israelites. The Assyrians invaded Samaria and later Judea which was by then being guided by the prophet, Isaiah. He proved to be a man of some wisdom and foresight and was obviously channelling a higher level of consciousness than some of the others. But on his death the old view ofJehovah returned with the human and animal sacrifices and the power of the priests. Other prophets like Jeremiah warned of the consequences. He predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple (slaughterhouse) built by Solomon. Jeremiah’s predictions were vindicated when the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar, attacked and defeated the people of Judea, the Jews. By 586Bc Judah was no more and Jerusalem was in ruins. The Jews were dispersed across Chaldea as had already happened to the Israelites. They absorbed the customs and beliefs of the Mesopotamian peoples and many moved their devotion from Jehovah to Bel. The exiles inherited the Chaldean idea of rest on the seventh day, the Sabatu, and on their return the tradition would begin of attending churches or Synagogues to hear the writings of the prophets. When they were freed by the Persians, as noted earlier, they took the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"59 Mesopotamian customs and beliefs back to Samaria and Judea along with some of the holy relics, including golden candlesticks which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from them. They now expected the Messiah to appear and lead them to their true destiny, although many Jews stayed in Babylon and other areas and did not choose to return to the promised land. The idea of a Messiah came from the Persians and from either there or Egypt they absorbed the belief in the resurrection of the physical body and that of a million years of righteousness. Palestine was ruled by the Persians, but the Jews were allowed to re-build the temple in Jerusalem and have their own religious hierarchy controlled by the Jewish people. The influence of Babylon in Jewish thought and belief continued to grow. Under the guidance of two men called Ezra and Nehemiah the Jewish society became a little more civilised. Both were greatly influenced by their time in Babylon where they heard the Chaldean stories of the Tower of Babel (Babylon), the Great Flood, and Noah. Ezra re-wrote the Book of the Law which had been destroyed when the temple was ransacked and the laws he says were given to Moses were no more than the beliefs Ezra picked up in Babylon like the Sabbath (Sabatu) and the idea that the Creator rested on the seventh day. Jewish influence grew across the Middle East and they expanded their numbers into many areas. The Greeks gave them the name Hebrews which means the ‘people from the other side’ (of the Mediterranean.) Some of the Jewish texts were translated into Greek. The Jews became traders, valuers, moneylenders and pawnbrokers, buying and selling primarily rather than producing. Alexander the Great, a man similar in attitude to King David, took over the Macedonian empire from his father and conquered Egypt and the land we know as Palestine. On the death of Alexander one of his generals, Ptolemy I, took over Jerusalem. This wasn’t difficult because he attacked on the Sabbath and the Jews refused to fight on their holy day. The Greek influence on the people of Jerusalem increased and a dispute developed between the Hellenised (Greek influenced) Jews and those who wished to retain the old ways ofJehovah. Conflict erupted and in walked the King of Syria, Antiochus IV, to assume power inJerusalem. How ironic as we chronicle this constant bloodshed that Jerusalem translates as ‘City of Peace’. Antiochus tried to force the pagan customs of Greece onto the believers in Jehovah and he insisted they worship a god"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"60 called Jove. A bloodbath ensued as the supporters of Jehovah resisted. The theme of constant conflict will be seen throughout human history. The Luciferic consciousness and the human expressions of that consciousness do not care what causes the conflict. A sense of religious or racial superiority, greed, a lust for power, anything will do. They will support a nation when it suits them and cause it to be destroyed when it doesn’t. All they want is for negative energy to be produced in abundance to serve the master, Lucifer, and for humanity to remain so divided and awash with fear and the pressure of every day life that they won’t open their minds for long enough to see who they are and what is really going on. I am not going to keep labouring this point through the rest of our brief history of humankind, except where I feel it needs to be highlighted. But keep in mind through all that follows how conflict and division are the aims of the disharmonious consciousness and anything that causes that serves its purpose. Often this will be stimulated by a direct attack on human minds by the Luciferic consciousness which manipulates the negative human emotions of ego, greed, and a wish for power. You don’t have to affect many people to start a war, given that for most of human history the decision of one king, queen, or dictator can decide the fate of millions who have no desire to fight. And you only have to affect the thinking of one side because once they attack, the other side has to defend itself and war has begun. You can start a war by affecting the mind of one person and if he or she happens to be an incarnation of the Luciferic consciousness its child’s play. The negative secret societies of the Brotherhood in their many forms have had an important role in the artificial creation of conflict by pulling the strings behind the scenes and whenever possible getting its members and followers into positions of power. Because it is has so many levels of initiation, one level can manipulate the lower levels who have no idea of the agenda being followed by their ‘superiors’. This very much applies to politicians today. In this way, people can help to start a conflict when they have no wish to do so. Say a brotherhood member is told of a plan by Nation A to attack Nation B or to undermine it in some way. That member might be persuaded to warn the leaders of nation B of what was going on. The member would do this out of the best of intentions. But he wouldn’t know that another member from a different branch of the brotherhood was telling Nation B exactly the same about Nation A. Those brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"61 members believe they are doing the right thing, but they won’t know that they are being used to start a conflict that would not have started otherwise. Once you have organisations based on secrecy and levels of initiation that the lower rungs know nothing about, a very few people can control the rest, most of whom might be lovely human beings who do not wish harm to anyone. So it is with the brotherhood. That may sound simplistic and these things are often more complex, but the basic themes of manipulation, agents, provocateurs, and secret brotherhood assassinations calculated to stir up conflict have been behind so much of the horror that has plagued the human story. The invaders of Jerusalem were eventually removed, but internal strife continued between two factions of the Jewish religion, the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Romans captured Judea and Jerusalem in 63Bc and after a bitter conflict they imposed on the people an Arab Prince called King Herod in 37Bc. Most members of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish Council and highest court ofjustice, opposed Herod and they were killed once he gained control. He also crushed the power of the Sadducees for their opposition to him and the Pharisees rose to ascendancy. Herod died in 4Bc and the internal conflict returned. The Romans assumed control and ruled through a series of procurators, one of which was called Pontius Pilatus. It was into this time and against this political and religious backdrop that a child was born called Jeshuah. The stories of his life would later be translated into Greek and it was then that the Jewish Jeshuah became the Greek version, Jesus. So the one thing we know for sure about Jesus is that his name wasn’t Jesus! I will, however, continue to use that name here for simplicity and because it really doesn’t matter what he was called. It is what he did that is important. He was, I believe, born and brought up as an Essene. For two hundred years before his birth a group called the Essenes or Therapeutae (meaning healers) had lived in Egypt and Palestine. They were inspired by the Buddhist philosophy more than the Jewish and it is likely that their beliefs originated in India, although they must also have been influenced by Egyptian thought as well. It is possible that Buddha, Socrates, and Jesus were the same consciousness and certainly the same overall higher self. The Jewish historian of the first century AD , Josephus, described the Essenes as the most honest people in the world and he said they followed the values ofjustice and equality at all times. They were"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"62 vegetarians and opposed animal or human sacrifice. They had a very different approach to life to the prevailing attitudes of the time. The Essenes had a number of centres in Egypt and Palestine and other lay members who lived in the general community, but they are best known for their settlements at Qumran alongside the Dead Sea where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 1947 and further down the shore at the giant flat-topped Mountain called Masada. It was here that the Jews rebelling against Roman rule would commit mass suicide rather that be captured in 73AD . I visited both places in a short, but unforgettable visit to Israel in 1993, as described in my autobiography. The love I felt flowing through me at those points was indescribable. At Qumran I found myself speaking the words: ‘I forgive them everything’, although I did not know why I said that or where the words came from. The Essenes were a brotherhood who worked a great deal in secret. But as I continue to stress, secrecy does not always mean conspiracy in times of great religious imposition. There have been times when keeping your beliefs and knowledge secret has been essential to your survival. I don’t believe the Essenes were the perfect people they are sometimes claimed to be, but overall I feel quite good about them and, anyway, I think Jesus was such a strong character that he would have made his own mind up about things and not blindly accepted another belief system. In the American west there was once a farmer called Maverick who refused to brand his animals. The word maverick became used to describe people who refuse to be branded and linked to one organisation or group. I think that under that definition of the word, Jesus was a maverick. I believe that the man known as Joseph of Arimathea could have been the father ofJesus and not his uncle as the stories claim. This is a thought which keeps coming to me again and again, and others have channelled this information. No one knows the background for sure, and it can only be speculation, but it is clear that Joseph of Arimathea was very close to Jesus. Joseph was an Essene, as was Mary, and the Essenes possibly told her of a child she was being asked to conceive with Joseph of Arimathea to ensure that the right genetic combinations interacted. The Essenes believed this child had been foretold and Mary, then only a young girl of perhaps fourteen, agreed. The Joseph who is called her husband in the gospels became the guardian of Jesus and fathered other children with Mary. But the genetic father of Jesus was I feel Joseph of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"63 Arimathea. This wa s a closely guarded secret known only to a few. Joseph of Arimathea was a rich landowner and businessman and a member of the Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin. Keeping his close family connections to Jesus a secret was vital if he was to play his part in the overall plan. We are looking here again at a highly significant incarnation of the volunteer consciousness. The story of Jesus and others in the Middle East was only part of what was happening at that time. All over the world other volunteers had incarnated to co-ordinate their work. They would not have known what was happening in Palestine, most of them anyway, but all would have been coordinated from a higher level in the same way that it is happening today. The early years ofJesus were spent with the Essenes in Qumran and in Egypt opening up to his true self, and remembering who he was and why he was here. He would have been fed rubbish along with the enlightened explanations and it would have been up to him to see the difference. Nothing changes. Jesus travelled further afield in the so called ‘lost years’ which are left blank by the Bible. He passed through Mesopotamia on his way to India and Kashmir and he was further influenced by the words of Buddha. (See A Search for the Historical Jesus by Prof. F. Hassnain) He spent several years with Buddhist thinkers and greatly impressed them with his knowledge and understanding. He also journeyed to Greece and England. He may have travelled to Glastonbury and other places in England with Joseph of Arimathea who imported tin from Cornwall. All the time he was learning - remembering - and passing on this knowledge. He was also channelling highly potent energies into the Earth’s energy grid. He had an energy field which allowed him to channel energies of immense power which would have ‘fried’ most other people. I am not saying for a moment that Jesus understood everything that was happening and exactly why he was doing certain things. He would have simply felt impelled to do them. Certainly he would have known the potential consequences of returning from his travels to Palestine to challenge the political, economic, and religious status quo, but the urgings of his higher self would have been almost impossible to ignore and he would have done many things without, at the time, knowing why. It is like that feeling we have when we know something is going to have an unpleasant outcome, but somehow we go on walking into it. Know the feeling? Me, too."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"64 His open and verbal challenge to the established and destructive order was an effort to wake people up by appealing directly to their lower consciousness. If the higher consciousness could not communicate powerfully enough with the lower consciousness of the people then one way around that isto channel information through another person, in this case Jesus, so he could speak directly to the lower consciousness by voice to ear. This is what all spiritual communicators come to do. I feel the area around Palestine, Egypt, and the Middle East was the centre of the temporary energy grid created after the end of Atlantis and if the consciousness of the people could be raised in that part of the world it would have a considerable effect on the planet, as would direct energy channelling into the grid at that point. These were the twin tasks of Jesus and those around him. It was, to say the least, not easy to achieve. Incarnating into the thick fog of negative, imbalanced, energy that was engulfing this planet made it even tougher. I know there are some who believe that everything that happens on Earth is meant to be and part of some grand Divine Plan. I don’t believe that. I feel most strongly that what we see on Earth is evolution that has taken an unfortunate and unnecessary turn caused by this period of Luciferic opportunity and the ability of the higher levels to affect the dense physical world is not always that easy. There is a basic plan for what needs to be done, but there is also much ad4ibbing that goes on in reaction to human behaviour. Much of this behaviour is not the work or design of the Source or our own higher selves. It is the consequence of the negative energy imbalance, the density of this frequency, the Luciferic consciousness, and the utter nonsense which is passed on through the generations to indoctrinate each new generation of lower selves with the same nonsense. So it was at the time ofjesus. I believe the idea that this man had to be nailed to a cross and die horribly for somejudgmental God to agree to forgive all the sins of humanity to be the most monumental nonsense I have ever heard. It never ceases to amaze me how many believe it. I feel the power and privilege that Jesus was challenging conspired to silence him. The religious hierarchy worked with the Romans who also didn’t want this trouble maker to go on making waves. Forces ofoccupation, whether physical, economic, or mental, know that people who think for themselves are dangerous; and people who encourage others to do the same are even more so. All the time the Luciferic consciousness"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"65 is seeking to work through these people to achieve its ends. Jesus was nailed to a cross, the Roman punishment at the time, but I do not believe he died there. From what I and others have channelled and written, I believe the following is at least quite close to the truth. Joseph of Arimathea was a central player in the plan to ensure that Jesus did not die on the cross. He owned the area known as the Garden of Gethsemane near the Mount ofOlivesjust outside the city walls of Jerusalem. As a member of the Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin, he would have known exactly what was being said about Jesus. Another Essene member of the Sanhedrin, the one called Nicodemus, also secretly supported Jesus and helped him as best he could. He, too, was an Essene. In fact there was a secret group of Essenes unrecorded by history who worked on behalf ofJesus and the overall plan far more effectively than those called the ‘disciples’. At least most of them did not know the full story of what was going on most of the time because the more who knew the more chance there was of something slipping out that would have ruined everything. Jesus, Joseph, and other Essenes devised a plan unknown to the disciples and even his mother Mary and his close companion, possibly his wife, Mary Magdalene. The plan was for Jesus to survive the cross. There were three main reasons for this, though no doubt there were others: (a) To take the pressure off those who were supporters ofjesus, including the Essenes, because there were many, including the Romans, who were moving towards the belief that it was necessary to remove them. The public death and humiliation ofJesus, their focal point, would disperse this growing desire for a wholesale removal of his supporters and family. Joseph would have known this because of his close links with the Sanhedrin. He might even have suggested this course of action as an alternative way of destroying this challenge to the status quo. (b) They knew that people who question convention often have more influence on thinking when they are dead (or are believed to be dead) than they do when they were alive. Take the example of Confucius, for instance. (c) To go through great pain and trauma with the intent of helping the Earth and humanity creates the energy of love in quite fantastic amounts and power. And on the land owned by Joseph of Arimathea was one of the key points on that central heart of the post-Atlantean grid. It was on this point that the crucifixion would take place."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"66 Jesus knew all this and being a brilliant medium in constant touch with the higher levels he would have channelled the basic themes. His secret group put together the plan under spiritual inspiration and the higher frequencies were at work from their realms helping to make it happen as required. The timing had to be perfect. Those who were crucified were left on the cross for as long as it took for them to die, usually up to three days. Unless there was some way around that, Jesus could not possibly have survived. The only way of shortening his time on the cross was to ensure that it happened in the hours before the Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. No-one was allowed to be executed and buried on that day and anyone still alive on the cross was killed before the start of the Sabbath. The usual method was to break their legs with a series of blows. This was fatal to anyone nailed by the wrists to a cross for rather gruesome reasons I won’t go into. Therefore they had to find a way of giving the appearance that Jesus was dead before the end of the Friday. Jesus made his entrance into Jerusalem to coincide with the timing he and Joseph had worked out. He was intentionally provocative, openly and publicly castigating the money lenders in the Temple, and generally stirring up discontent with the Jewish and Roman authorities. He wanted to make them act against him immediately. The much-maligned Judas was crucial to the plot, too. He was in on the plan and he ‘betrayed’ Jesus at the moment necessary to maintain the strict timing of the sequence of events. In the background, Joseph and Nicodemus, were working away within the Sanhedrin to ensure they were reacting to schedule. The arrest ofJesus and the questioning by the Jewish hierarchy, and Pilate followed the predicted time sequence and he was sentenced and nailed to the cross on the Friday. The crucifixion took place at a spot which adjoined the Garden of Gethsemane, owned by Joseph of Arimathea. IfJesus was thought to be still alive by the end of that day he would have been killed to avoid running over into the Sabbath. The Essenes were well known for their knowledge of herbs and plants which they used in their healing. It would have been no problem for them to provide a mixture that would give the appearance of physical death. Indeed there are many documented examples of such drugs in ancient cultures, including one called Toska, a drink made of sour wine and wormwood. It was given by Jewish women to those being crucified to help them lose consciousness. Again at the right time, a drug was given to Jesus on a"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"67 sponge which was put to his mouth with the excuse of giving him a drink. Soon after this he appeared to expire. The emphasis is on the word ‘appeared’ because although he was exhausted and in great pain and distress, he was still alive. One unfortunate event which had not been foreseen was when a soldier pierced his side after he was taken down. This produced much blood, another indication that he was taken from the cross alive. In the hours before his apparent death’ he was the focal point in a vast energy channelling being coordinated by the higher levels right across the world. Volunteers incarnate in all cultures were involved although they would not have been aware that what they were doing was being mirrored all over the planet. Joseph of Arimathea went immediately to Pilate and asked for permission to remove the body of Jesus for burial. Pilate agreed after registering his surprise that Jesus had died so quickly and asking for confirmation. In preparation for what was to happen, Joseph had built a tomb in the Garden of Gethsemane so that Jesus could be taken from the cross to the safety of the tomb as quickly as possible. The quicker it happened the less chance there was that someone would realise what was going on and the sooner he could be given medical treatment the better. A large stone was pushed across thQ. entrance to ensure no one could see what was going on inside. Waiting in the tomb when Jesus was brought in were Essene healers in white robes and they began the healing process immediately. Jesus was in a bad way, but the healers stabilised his condition. Under cover of darkness, the stone at the entrance to the tomb was pushed back and Jesus was taken to the Essene Community at Q umran via a safe house. After a long convalescence, he recovered and left the region with Joseph and the two Marys to continue the work of energy channelling and passing on information. I feel he travelled to places like Italy, Crete, France, and India where he might have died a very old man in Kashmir. Some researchers believe he was known by many names to different peoples and in Kashmir he was Yuzu Asaph. His tomb is still there. However, others believe that Jesus ended his life in France. During a vision of the crucifixion which I had on one occasion, I channelled a series of short sentences which said: “ Essenes, Qumran. Time to recover. Illusion complete. Opposition believe I am dead. Much travel. Long lifetime. Three children by two"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68 women.” Surviving a crucifixion may sound far-fetched, but Josephus the historian documents a story of a man known to him who was taken down from the cross alive and survived. Josephus knew the man and pleaded with the Roman commander, Titus, for him to be spared. Titus agreed and the man was taken from the cross and given medical treatment. Still today in the Phillipines there are people who agree to be nailed to the cross as part of some bizarre ritual to confirm their faith and when they are taken down after some hours they recover. So it was possible to survive a crucifixion if you were not subjected to that horror for too long. Remember also that other levels would have been working to help Jesus during that time and giving to him the energies and strength to keep him incarnate. The disciples, as I mentioned, were not in on the plan, apart from Judas who was considered, rightly as it turned out, to be the most trustworthy! When the tomb was found to be empty and the great stone pushed back, it was assumed the body had been stolen and later by some that Jesus had been resurrected. i.e. That his physical body had gone to Heaven. In fact he was recovering in a safe house with his Essene healers before being taken on to Qumran. Jesus had used the Jewish belief in a Messiah figure and the predictions of previous Jewish prophets to create interest in himself and therefore his words. It was like building a public platform from which he could speak his truths. He would stress how events in his life had been written in the ancient prophecies, but he and his secret support group were creating those events so they would match the prophecies. It was part of the plan to use the Jewish belief system to create interest and notoriety. Most of the disciples were not aware of this. Their inability to commit themselves totally to the work and understand its importance frustrated him and he was much closer to Joseph and his secret group. The ones called the disciples were a sort of ‘front’ for what was really going on behind the scenes and for that to work and appear credible it was vital that they had no knowledge of what was happening. They were very important to the work, but only if they didn’t know the full story. The plan worked magnificently in that everyone was fooled and Jesus achieved what he and his family and supporters came to achieve in relation to the energy grid. He also left behind a lot of"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"69 people who were moved and motivated by his simple truths about love, Creation, and the eternal nature of all consciousness. The myths that were now to surround him made him far better known than ever he was in his lifetime in Palestine. No mention has been found of him in the works of the history writers of the time and yet look what has been written about him since his life was highjacked by the religion called Christianity. Others have channelled and seen the same basic story that I have outlined and researchers working purely from historical information (plus some higher inspiration) have come up with the same themes, too. What I have no doubt about are the following: The overall reason for the Jesus incarnation; that he did not die on the cross; and that he was not celibate. I feel he was married to or at least the close companion of Mary Magdalene with whom he had children and that he fathered a child with at least one other woman, possibly Mary Magdalene’s sister, Martha. This might make some Church people reel back in horror, but the energy patterns that Jesus brought into incarnation would not have been wasted. They would have been passed on through the genetic line. This could well have meant that he needed to interact physically with more than one other energy field to create particular energy and genetic combinations. I talk more of this process of sexual interaction and the many reasons for it in my book, Heal The World. We should not forget, I feel, that Jesus was only one of the volunteer incarnations, although a highly significant one. He played an effective and couragous part in helping the Earth and humanity, but so have millions of others. It has been a continuous, on-going, process and not something that happened only once 2,000 years ago. He was very much a man of this physical level while being in close contact with his higher self. He had the emotions of compassion, love, and at times anger. He spoke his mind and the idea that he went around in some spiritual mist talking kindly to everyone is well wide of the mark, I would say. Yes, he was kind to people and he had great love for the Earth and humanity, but sometimes love involves speaking out vehemently against injustice if that is what is necessary for change to happen and for people to awaken. It is such an irony that it is the way his lifetime was to be misrepresented that has made him the most famous of the volunteer incarnations. After Jesus left Palestine with the two Marys, Joseph of Arimathea and others, the followers of his teachings Uesuians) were, apart from"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"70 the Essenes, small offshoots of the Jewish religion like the Gnostics and Ebionites. There was no overall belief system and they each held different views about the details and meaning of his life. Most of them did, however, believe in his return or Second Coming which is an ancient idea that goes back to Sun worship. Once again these early groups ofJesus followers were guided by channellers and you can see these referred to in the ancient texts as ‘vessels’ for the holy spirit who were filled with the ‘Spirit of the Lord.’ We read of people being filled with the Holy Spirit and then speaking the words of the Lord. Anyone who has experienced or witnessed channelling will know that an energy descends upon the channeller. This is the communicating consciousness enveloping and synchronising with the physical vehicle or vessel through which it seeks to communicate. It is this energy which channellers and onlookers feel that became termed the ‘holy spirit’ in ancient times. These Jesus-inspired groups were much like a spiritualist Church of today with people gathered to hear the communications of the medium, the ones blessed with ‘charismata’, the Greek word for psychic abilities. It was only when the man we call St Paul came on the scene that Jesus, the wise and courageous philosopher, healer, and channel, was turned into the pagan saviour-god depicted by Christianity. Paul was an orthodox Jew who persecuted those sects which followed a belief in the philosophy ofJesus. This changed dramatically after he claimed to have seen a vision ofJesus on the road to Damascus. This could have been a psychic vision of an non physical entity, or a three- dimensional holographic figure projected from a spacecraft, or he could have made it all up. But the latter is unlikely because from then on he clearly believed that Jesus was communicating with him and asking to be proclaimed Messiah and Saviour of the World. Paul was following the age old custom of people believing that every ghost they saw or psychic communication they experienced was from God, the Highest One, or in this case God’s ‘son’. What appalling consequences this was to have. We should remember that Paul came from a place called Tarsus in Asia Minor and there they worshipped a Greek pagan Saviourgod called Dionysus - their version of Bel. Dionysus was said to have been born to a virgin impregnated by the god Zeus and suffered and died to save humanity. Paul clearly saw Jesus as another incarnation of Dionysus, the one he was taught to worship in Tarsus. All he did"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"71 was transfer the myths about Dionysus to the philosopher called Jesus. Dionysus was the Greek Christ and the second in a trinity of Demeter, Dionysus, and Persephone in the same vein as other pagan gods throughout the Middle East. Dionysus was known as ‘Our Lord’, ‘the Vine’, ‘the Saviour’, ‘the Judge of the Dead’, ‘the Deliver’, ‘the Born Again’, and ‘the Only Begotten Son of God’. Above the head of Dionysus were depicted the words ‘I am Life, Death, and Resurrection, I hold the winged crown . He is also claimed to have said: ‘I am at one with my father in heaven’, and a service called the Eukharistia which involved animal sacrifice was performed in his honour. Paul was fundamentally influenced by the Greek Mystery brotherhood) beliefs and saviour god myths and these became fused in his mind with Jewish dogma. It is also possible that Paul was influenced by the Greek mystery schools. If they were controlled by the negative aspects of the Brotherhood at the time, they could have set him up and mind-controlled him to do what he did, and believe what he saw (or didn’t) was Jesus. The lamb dying so our sins could be forgiven would have been a basic part of his belief system and he would have had no trouble linking this ancient pagan myth to Jesus. People who were sacrificed on the altars for thousands of years were seen in the same light. From these beginnings did Paul found what became the Christian Faith. Jesus didn’t start Christianity. Paul did. I am not suggesting for a moment that Saul of Tarsus (St Paul) set out to cause all the horrors that his misunderstandings would create. He probably did it with the best of intentions and believed everything he said. I am sure the same can be said for most of those who followed him as guides and manipulators of the Christian faith. They, themselves, were being manipulated. Paul set off on his travels to tell people what Jesus was saying through him and his letters are reported in the New Testament. He made his living making tents on his journeys and three years after he saw his ghost or vision, or whatever it was, he arrived in Jerusalem to meet the disciple Peter and James, the brother of Jesus. They didn’t think much of him and they opposed his views about Jesus. Paul admits he never knew or met Jesus in his lifetime, but he believed Jesus was now speaking to him from the world of the gods. This, he thought, made him much more knowledgeable about him than the disciples. There was a split between the believers in Jesus as a man and philosopher and the Pauline Christians who followed his belief in a recycled Dionysus, who was said to have been born on December"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"72 25th. This relates to the ancient cult of the Sun God in which the periods of mid-Winter, mid-Summer, and the solstices and seasons were seen as sacred times. Paul’s Christianity was to win the day and pagan priests were absorbed into his Church. They had no problem being converted, because to them Jesus was just another pagan Saviour-god in the image of those they were used to. With their arrival Christianity became even more paganised. The pagan religion called Mithraism was also absorbed into the Pauline version of Christianity. Mithraism worshipped the saviour- god, Mithra, (see Dionysus, Bel, Osiris, Krishna, ad infinitum) and they celebrated his birthday on December 25th, the beginning of their Winter. Names like Mithra and Dionysus were simply changed to Jesus and so we have the Christian Christmas Day. Mithra was also believed to have risen from the dead at Easter and the pagans-turned-Christian-pagans welcomed that Festival into the Christian belief system. According to the Mithraists, Sunday was ‘the Lords Day’ and the Eucharist, the baptism of babies, the idea of father, son, and holy spirit, the virgin mother giving birth to the saviour, the marriage service and so much more were taken from various streams of paganism and added to Christianity. These pagan beliefs were a mixture of extra-terrestrial ‘gods’, channelling and visions, the movement of the Sun through the seasons and the sky, and downright make-believe. As we have seen, the idea ofJesus as ‘the lamb of God’ dying so our sins could be forgiven goes back to the pagan animal sacrifices in which the lamb was said to take the place of humanity to quell the anger of the gods. Mithraism was now Myth-raism - better known as Christianity. It is worth pointing out that far from claiming that Jesus was born by divine intervention without intercourse, the oldest Greek and Syrian manuscripts say ‘Joseph begat Jesus’. The idea of the virgin birth was a later insertion, as were all the additions that fostered the myth that Jesus the philosopher was Christ the saviour-god. Even the word Christ is of pre-Christian origin as Chrest (Egypt) and Christos (Greek). The story of the virgin birth of the Egyptian Son of God, Horus, has been found on a temple wall in Luxor and that was depicted long before Christianity was even thought of. In these early years of the Christian Church many changes were made to texts to justify the inventions. Words were attributed to Jesus which said: ‘He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved, but he that believeth not"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"73 shall be damned’. This was added to increase the power of the Church and the priests. The priests took over the Pauline version of Jesus and this was such an enormous irony given that Jeshuah, the Jewish philosopher, challenged the whole idea of priests. The original Jesuian form of worship was overpowered by what became Christianity, that misguided mixture of pagan and Jewish myths and stories, some of which carry themes of symbolic and hidden truth, many of which are utter rubbish. Only the names changed, not the stories and myths. Cyprian, who died in 258, was the Bishop of Carthage and he did more than most to secure the priestly takeover. It was he who promoted the belief that only those who became Christians would have salvation. He said people should not have their own opinions - only those which the Church decided they should have. What power this would give to the priests in the centuries that followed to serve the desires of the Luciferic master. The values of the brave and brilliant philosopher, healer, and channel called Jeshuah had been all but obliterated by Paul’s recycled paganism and the darkness of ignorance and pain was to descend upon the human race for nearly two thousand years. This happened after Christianity’s most important victory, its acceptance as the state Church of the Roman Empire. For that we have to thank, though that is hardly the word, a Roman Emperor called Constantine the Great."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"74 5 Hell on Earth CONSTANTINE I became Emperor of all the Roman lands in 312 and within thirteen years he had, in effect, decided the future for much of humanity for nearly two millennia. Constantine ‘the Great’ as he was to become known, served as a soldier and won a reputation for courage and military prowess. After spending some time serving in Britain he was elected by his army as Caesar of the West. He determined to be Emperor of all, and began the process of killing his rivals and sometimes their children, too. The Christian legend is that at the scene of one of his battles for the Roman throne he had a vision of a cross. It was at the battle of Milvian Bridge, near Rome and he is said to have seen the cross in the sky with the words ‘By this Conquer’. The following night he is claimed to have seen a vision of Jesus who told him to put the cross symbol on his flag to guarantee victory over his enemies. Yes, that sounds like just what the Prince of Peace would say, doesn’t it? This whole story is probably another Christian invention, but for some reason Constantine began to look kindly on the Christians. The Brotherhood would have been working behind the scenes somewhere, I feel sure. Constantine issued the Edict of Milan which stopped the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. Some Christians had been persecuted horribly in earlier years although Gibbon, the historian who made a study of this, concluded that the numbers have been greatly exaggerated. He believes something like 2,000 Christians were murdered and tor tured in the pre-Constantine period while 25 million are estimated to have been executed in the centuries that followed for the crime of not accepting the Christian faith. Both figures are terrible, but it puts what was to unfold into some perspective. Constantine thought a cross was a lucky mascot after his vision’, and in fact the cross as a religious symbol goes back to the time when"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"75 humans discovered that by rubbing two sticks together you can make fire. They believed that fire was a god and two crossed sticks were seen as sacred. The cross can be found on ancient graves and it was a religious symbol in Egypt, Assyria, Persia, India, Mexico and Scandinavia, long before Christianity. The Egyptians saw their cross, or crux ansata, as symbolic of salvation and eternal life, and our old friends the Mithraists marked the foreheads of the newly initiated with the sign of the cross. Ancient stories also describe how human sacrifices were bound to a cross and anointed with oil, so they would burn better on the altar. From such bleak traditions has Christianity come. Constantine was never a Christian as such and he only agreed to be baptised on his death bed, no doubt as a bit of insurance. He worshipped both Jesus and the Greek god, Apollo, and he remained the head of the Pagan Church as Pontifex Maximus. But he gave Christianity the same status as the others and made substantial donations to its cause. Significantly he allowed the Church to receive legacies which had been banned up to this point and from here the Christian Church would begin to accumulate fantastic wealth as people tried to buy a place in heaven. Constantine’s efforts to increase the Christian ranks led to bribes for the poor if they became Christians, and the offer of good jobs to wealthy Pagans who converted to the faith. Constantine became concerned when disputes began to erupt between different Christian beliefs. A churchman called Anus in Alexandria questioned the idea that Jesus was the same as God. How could a son be the same as his father and had notJehovah said that only he was God? When the Bishop of Alexandria, appropriately named Alexander, was preaching about the trinity of father, son, and holy spirit, Anus publicly questioned him. You may not think it important in the great tapestry of life to decide ifJesus was only a vehicle for God or part of three gods in one, but it now became the question that had to be decided. Anus left Alexandria for Palestine in fear of his life and two factions emerged. Neither would give way and this difference was being ridiculed throughout the Empire by the non-believers and was no doubt fuelled by the Brotherhood. Constantine had wanted, at least in part for political reasons, to make Christianity the state religion, but he could not do this unless the disputes were settled. He called together the bishops at Nicaea which is now Iznik in Turkey where he had a palace. At their first meeting in June 325 no"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"76 agreement could be reached between the 318 bishops on the burning issue of the day: was Jesus part of a trinity of father, son, and holy spirit? - whatever that was supposed to mean. Constantine arrived shortly after murdering his wife and elder son. He moved the proceedings to his palace and presided over all that followed. He said a decision had to be reached because only when that happened could Christianity be the state Church. It is clear he wasn’t much bothered what they decided as long they decided something. A bitter argument broke out between the factions as documents were torn up and blows were struck. This is the atmosphere in which the Christian creed was officially decided. Constantine agreed to a motion which was accepted by the majority though vehemently opposed by Anus and his supporters. It became known as the Nicene Creed and it read as follows: “We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all things, both visible and invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the son of God, begotten of the Father, only begotten, that is to say, of the same substance of the Father, God of God and Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the father, by whom all things were made, both things in heaven and things on earth; who, for us men and for our salvation, came down and was made flesh, made man, suffered and rose again on the third day, went up into the heavens, and is to come again to judge the quick and the dead; and in the holy ghost.” There is a saying which goes: ‘A camel is a horse designed by a committee.’ If ever there was an example of that it is the above. I find it interesting also that this official creed of Christianity talks of ‘for us men and our salvation’. What about women? But then it would only be in 1545 that the Roman Church officially agreed that women had souls - and then only by a majority of three votes! The Jewish philosopher, healer, and medium called Jeshuah was now officially a saviour-god who, like the lambs on the pagan sacrificial altars, died so that our sins could be forgiven forever as long as we believe in him as our saviour and it is worth remembering that this decision on who Jesus was came 300 years after his death. It was also made by people who believed the Earth was flat and Jerusalem was the centre of the Universe; this decision remains the foundations of the Christian Church to this day. Before the Council of Nicaea closed,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"77 Constantine agreed to a motion that Anus and his followers be officially cursed and either executed, imprisoned, or banished. Other decrees applied the same Christian justice to all who read any writings by those who now became known as Arians. The Arian view is still expressed today, incidentally, by the Unitarians. Thousands of Arians were murdered, the first of the estimated 25 million victims who would die in the name of Christianity and that is not including those who would perish in religious wars and the estimated 12 million who were killed in the Christian conquest of the Americas. Added together world-wide the number who perished as a result of the Christian religion must easily pass 100 million. To be excommunicated by the Church was almost a death sentence in itself, because you could not be guilty of murder if you killed someone who was excommunicated. Anus, however, escaped death to continue to expound his cause and the arguments went on over the trinity. In about 336 Constantine even ordered that Anus be readmitted to the Church, but before this could be done Anus died in mysterious circumstances and the following year Constantine passed on, also. On his death bed he was baptised by a bishop who did not accept the trinity. By then he had moved the capital of the empire from Rome to Byzantium - now Turkey - and he built a new city which he called Constantinople. It was about 44 miles from Nicaea. Here he had built Christian churches and dedicated the city to the Virgin Mary and Christianity was to become the State Church of the Roman Empire. This Romanized Christianity was given the name Roman Catholicism. All that happened, in reality, was that the previous Roman state saviour, Mithra, was renamed Jesus Christ. Constantine’s mother, Helena, was sent to Jerusalem to find the biblical sites and she claimed to have found the exact locations of the birth ofJesus, his crucifixion, the tomb, and even where he ascended into the sky. It was on her say so that Constantine built a basilica in 326 on the spot where she said Jesus had been crucified. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is on that site today and attracts millions of Christian pilgrims to the place where Jesus hung on the cross. Or, rather, where Helena said it happened. She was obviously quite a sleuth, because during her trip she claimed to have found the three wooden crosses involved in the crucifixion three hundred years after they were supposed to have been used!! The names of three people are worth emphasising in these early years of the Christian Church - Augustine, Jerome, and Ambrose."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"78 Arthur Findlay in his study of the Church likens them to the Nazis, Hitler, Goebbels, and Himmler. When you compare their backgrounds and behaviour, it is hard to argue against that, but before we start condemning them as individuals we need to ask who, or what, was in control of them? I would stress that I am not condemning anyone in this book. I am looking at thought and behaviour patterns which have guided human history and the individuals involved are victims of those patterns as much as the people who suffered from their actions. Forgive them, they know not what they do, is a good line to remember when reading the next few chapters. Augustine imposed a tyrannical rule and used force and fear to swell the Christian ranks. He would quote the words ofJesus to justify his actions: ‘Compel them to come in, that my house be filled’, and ‘But those mine enemies, which would not that I reign over them, bring hither and slay them before me. These were quoted to excuse the murder or forced conversion of non-believers. Yet these quotations, as with ‘I came not to send peace, but a sword’, and others, were inventions. They were inserted into the texts as justification of war, murder, and endless other horrors in the name of the ‘Prince of Peace’. Augustine sought to impose a global creed by exterminating the opposition. Religious ‘error’, he said, must be treated like treason, a crime against the state, and be punished as such. He said that babies who died before they were baptised would, like all the unbaptised, be condemned to hell for all eternity, and he used fear of death and the fear of hell and damnation after death, to expand his vicious and ignorant creed. He would, like Jerome and Ambrose, later be declared a saint. Jerome, born in 341, was the man responsible for producing the texts for the first ‘Holy’ Bible. It was he, also, who led the campaign of persecution against the mediums and channellers who had been at the centre of religious belief from the very start of human existence. In a short time, the gift of communicating with other frequencies would be a death sentence. The channellers were replaced by the priests as the ‘middle men’ between God and humanity. Channellers who were frauds in the past had made up communications to make the people do whatever they wished, and now the priests would do the same without the need to stage a fraudulent channelling. But, as always, there were many genuine channellers who were communicating with other levels, and their communicators were opposing the Church’s beliefs and behaviour. They had to be shut up"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"79 and they were. Countless numbers were tortured and murdered as witches. Priestly rule had arrived. As Jerome put it: “We tell them (the channellers) that we do not so much reject prophecy (channelling), as refuse to receive prophets (channellers) whose utterances fail to accord with the Scriptures old and new.” In other words we don’t mind people channelling as long as what they communicate supports what we have decided is truth. And as the Church had control of the ‘scriptures’ they could change whatever they liked to support their view. The philosopher Celsus wrote of this in the third century. He said of the religious hierarchy: “You utter fables, and you do not even possess the art of making them seem likely... You have altered three, four, times and oftener the texts of your own Gospels in order to deny objections made to you.” There were so many differing beliefs in the first three centuries after the life ofJesus that no two gospels or epistles (letters claimed to be from apostles) were alike. Bits had been added, deleted, and changed to fit the beliefs of those who possessed them. Modern research has shown that the text of Mark was the first of the ‘Bible’ gospels to be written and the others merely copied that and put in their own additions. Earlier texts from which Mark and other Gospel writers copied have been lost, but even so there were other writings about Jesus which the Church rejected, as we will see. No one knows who wrote the biblical texts, when, and from what personal direction they were coming from. Yet this is the book that has controlled the evolution of much of the world for the best part of two thousand years! Jerome’s suppression of truth and alternative thought was two- fold. He persuaded the Pope to make channelling a crime and the Oracles and Vessels of God became with one Papal decree, Oracles and Vessels of the Devil, names still used by many within the Church today. And he also took control of the ancient texts and made them fit his image of truth. Jerome became secretary to Pope Damasus in about 382 and he was commissioned to bring together all the various texts into a book which reflected (his) orthodox belief. It was now that the texts were made to fit the view that Jeshuah the philosopher was no less than Jesus the Christ who had died so our sins would be forgiven. Jerome’s rewriting of ancient texts and the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"80 rejection of anything he didn’t agree with, produced the wording which became the New Testament. Christians believe this to be the word of Jesus and God. It isn’t. It is largely the word of Jerome. The additions and deletions by Jerome and others created a contradictory mess. The Bible tells us, for example, that the genetic line ofJesus can be traced back from his father Joseph to King David. But how can this be ifjoseph played no part in his conception? In fact both the genetic line and the idea of the virgin birth were additions to the texts. Jerome and Augustine looked through thirteen gospels, nine acts and teachings of the Apostles, thirty-one epistles, and other writings, and decided which were ‘orthodox’ and which were not. Surprise, surprise, they agreed that the ones Jerome had doctored were orthodox and the rest should be discarded, and it was these that the Council of Carthage agreed should be accepted by the Church. Some of those that were rejected were much nearer the truth than those that became the New Testament. Pope Innocent I confirmed the decision at Carthage, and a hundred years later Pope Gelasius I decreed that only these approved writings (called canonical) were to be read in churches. Those who disobeyed were to be tortured and killed as heretics. Jerome also turned his mind to re-writing the texts that became the Old Testament, but even his faith in these as the Word of God was challenged by all the contradictions he found. He had to admit that his efforts to make sense of it could only be considered makeshift. When the two testaments were brought together in the 6th century the Old, which Jerome didn’t really understand, was joined with the New, which Jerome had edited to suit his beliefs. By these methods was the Holy Bible created and Jehovah, the vengeful God of the Jews and quite possibly an extra-terrestrial, became merged with the God of Jesus. Is it any wonder that it produced a book so full of blatant contradictions? Fortunately some themes of truth have survived and particularly some of the written and numerical symbols and codes that the original texts contained. Many of these have been retained because the forgers and editors like Jerome did not understand their significance. To them they were just numbers or literal stories. But some are codes and symbols waiting for those who have the understanding to decipher them. After Constantine’s death, there had been a period when Pagan and Arian beliefs had their supporters among the Roman Emperors. During one period under the Emperor Constantius be lievers in the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"81 trinity were persecuted when he accepted the Arian view. Whoever had prominence it was still a case of Christians killing Christians in an argument over the trinity or no trinity. Then the Emperor Theodosius ‘the Great’ came to power in 379, and with him so did orthodox (Jeromian) Christianity. Theodosius was a staunch supporter of the Nicene Creed who ordered the slaughter of 1,500 men, women, and children on one occasion alone in retaliation for the murder of one of his commanders and some soldiers. He issued the laws which were to be known as the Theodosian Code. These ordered imprisonment, torture, death or banishment for the crime of the heresy of not accepting the Nicene Creed. He also appointed a group of priests called The Inquisitors of the Faith. Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan, was the founder of the Holy Inquisition which was to turn a large tract of the world into a human abbatoir. Wars were fought over the imposition of the Christian Orthodox (Nicene) Faith and tens of millions would be killed in the most terrible ways in the name of Christianity. The Brotherhood organisations were being controlled more and more by negative intent. They were gaining ever greater control of events as their membership, and offshoots grew ever more quickly. Now the Luciferic Consciousness was not only in control of the Church, it was the Church. This was to continue into modern times. The Inquisition Office is now called the Holy Office. The further erosion of truth came with the Emperor Justinian in the 6th century. From his headquarters in Constantinople he schemed to have references to pre-existence and reincarnation removed from the Bible. He convened the Second Synod Council of Constantinople in 553 which, even without the attendance or support of the Pope, agreed that: “If anyone assert the fabulous pre-existence of souls and shall submit to the monstrous doctrine that follows from it, let him be. . excommunicated.” The spiritual truths that were being passed on through the Brotherhood, at certain levels of it, anyway, were now destroyed in the public arena. The ‘Great Work of Ages’ or, to give it its modern name, The New World Order, was right on course in its desire to part human beings from the knowledge of who they are. With the fall of the Roman Empire, the Christian Church took its place and the Pope became the equivalent of the Roman Em peror. A"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"82 sufficient number of the tribes and peoples who replaced Roman rule were Christianised for the view of the Roman Catholic Church to prevail. Now the power of the Church was total. They believed that because the Old Testament said that Adam had incurred God’s wrath by eating from the tree of knowledge, that the pursuit of all knowledge outside of the Bible was sinful. In the same way, because Eve had tempted him to eat from the tree, women were considered to be evil and of no worth. These breathtaking interpretations and the fear of the Inquisition was to hold back human evolution for at least two thousand years. Today’s scientific establishment is still not as advanced in its overall understanding of life and Creation as were Socrates, Plato, and others in Ancient Greece. The Christians destroyed all the writings of the great philosophers. Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum were closed and their writings burned. The Roman educational system inspired by Quintilian was dismantled and the great library at Alexandria became a theological college. Philosophers, scientists, and school teachers were persecuted. Hypatia, one of the outstanding women of her time, had her flesh torn from her body by a Christian mob for the ‘crime’ of speaking eloquently on science, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy in ways that contradicted orthodox Christianity. She worked at the library in Alexandria and all the books it contained were then destroyed. This was all done in the name of Cyril, the Archbishop of Alexandria. He was later made a saint. I can recommend a book called The Vicars of Christ which is a record of the Roman Catholic popes by a former Roman Catholic priest, Peter Da Rosa. It is a superb expose of the hypocrisy and deceit upon which Christianity was built. And remember, until the Reformation and the birth of the Protestant version in the 16th century, the Roman Catholic Church was Christianity. The Vatican had a whole department dedicated to producing forged ‘historical’ documents to hoodwink kings, queens, and others into doing their will. In most cases the Church’s ‘will’, as, increasingly, with the Brotherhood, was for them to wage war on non-believers or to hand over land and money to add to their, by now, amazing wealth. The post of Pope was not spiritual, but commercial, and the negative Brotherhood societies made every effort to make sure that ‘their’ men got the job or someone who was easily manipulated. The"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"83 Vatican to this day is run by the Brotherhood. If they could control the Pope, the potential to create wars and impose their will was almost infinite. Popes were considered by many to be ‘infallible’, the mouthpiece of God, and whatever they wanted they had to be given. As a result the Papacy attracted all the wrong characters for all the wrong reasons. One pope was so unhinged that he had the body of a previous pope exhumed from the grave and brought to his room. He ordered that the rotting remains were sat down in a chair so he could tell him what he thought of him! Apparently, one of the Pope’s staff stood behind the dead pope answering on his behalf like some ventriloquist with a dummy. It is sobering to think that such misguided people were making decisions that would affect the lives of humanity up to the present day. Or was it always they who actually made the decisions? Probably not. Either way, we still have Roman Catholic priests who must stay celibate and unmarried because of what popes - or their controllers - decided a thousand years ago and more. The story went like this: 325AD : The Council of Nicaea decides that no one will be allowed to marry after their ordination. 385AD : Pope Siricius decrees that men who are married before their ordination must not sleep with their wives afterwards. 590 - 604AD: Pope Gregory the Great decides that all desire for sex is sinful. Sex was only for producing children. 1074AD: Pope Gregory VII says that all priests must pledge themselves to be celibate. The consequences of the Roman Catholic hang-ups about sex have been to pass on this ‘dirty’, ‘sinful’, view of sexual love to the generations that followed. Even today we still see its legacy. We are also seeing many stories coming to light of Roman Catholic priests and their sexual abuse of children. The Vatican seeks to avoid responsibility for this, but at the core of such behaviour is the forced suppression of natural sexual urges imposed by Papal dictators between ten and seventeen centuries ago and upheld by successive Papal dictators ever since. But they can’t change it because to do so would make it clear that Pope Gregory VII was fallible in ordering such a ridiculous rule. And as popes are considered infallible, none of them can change - at least publicly -’ what a previous one has decided! The idea of ‘sinful’ sex was promoted by Augustine. He was well- known for his love of sex earlier in his life, but when he claimed to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"84 have abstained, he took on a view of sex that was similar to the way some people who stop smoking see others who continue to smoke. He became obsessive in his condemnation, and would not allow a woman to enter his house unaccompanied. This included his sister. Such was his power within the Church that his belief that sex and lust were sinful became the accepted view. The suppression of the flow of creative energy activated by natural sexual activity has expressed itself in negative emotions and behaviour, as well as health problems resulting from blocked energy. Using the ‘safe period’ to enjoy sex without conceiving was condemned as a wicked sin by Augustine. You should never have sexual relationships unless you intend to conceive a child, they decided, and even then under no circumstances must you enjoy it!! This nonsense continues to blight the lives of so many to this day. I have always found it hilarious that the Church says that God made the physical body, but we should be so ashamed of this creation that we must never allow others to see it or, at the extreme, even see it ourselves. But Augustine’s view on love, marriage, and sex was followed by the Church from then on. As he said over and over again: “Husbands love your wives, but love them chastely. Insist on the work of the flesh only in such measure as is necessary for the procreation of children. Since you cannot beget children in any other way [an oversight by God, presumably], you must descend to it against your will, for it is the punishment of Adam.” Poor old Adam and Eve. They get it in the neck for everything, even the fact that we have to be punished by being forced to have sex. Augustine linked sex with ‘original sin’, the idea that we are all born sinful. If we are conceived through the sexual act, we are by definition born with original sin which is supposed to go back to Adam and Eve. Jesus was the only one born without original sin, because his was a virgin birth which did not involve sex. Follow the logic? Later to overcome the obvious contradiction that Jesus was born to a mother who was born with original sin, she, too, was said to have been conceived without sex. But hold on. In that case, Jesus was born without original sin to a mother without original sin, but she was born to a mother with original sin. Shock, horror. Unless of course, the grandmother of Jesus was also conceived without sex. In that case.... No, no, I think we’ll leave it there. You see how"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"85 confusing it gets once you try to cover your tracks? It is the same whenever you tell lies. You have to keep lying to cover up previous lies and you get yourself in a terrible mess. The Roman Church also conveniently ignores the fact that the one they consider to be the first pope, the ‘disciple’ Peter, was married and not celibate. From this insult to the intelligence has come a view of sex, the physical body, marriage, divorce, and women that was to prevail for nearly two thousand years. The suppression of women has been passed through the generations by the major religions. Christian dogma used the Adam and Eve story in the Jewish Old Testament to justify this. They also quote people like St Paul: “Wives submit to your husbands for the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the Church. Now if the Church submits to Christ so should wives submit to their husbands in everything.” And: “But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.” In the last years of the 20th century, the Bible is still being quoted in opposition to women priests. When the Church of England voted in favour of women in the priesthood in 1993, members of the Church resigned in protest and joined the Roman Catholics - some of them women! The male domination in all areas of life has helped to extend the domination of male energy over female which has made the world what it is today. This has served Lucifer’s ambitions magnificently. A domination of male energy over female is vital to his plans. All consciousness is both male and female, and we all have male and female lives to ensure a balance of experiences. The current transformation will see a rebalancing of the male-female energies around the planet and this will manifest in the emergence of women in decision making and the activation of female energies, like caring and compassion, within those in male bodies. Both men and women are capable of expressing male and female energy. The Christian obsession with destroying paganism, while at the same time absorbing it, led to a further polluting of the Earth energy grid, as did all the negative energy being created by the murder and mayhem. Early churches were built on Pagan sacred sites. Some sects"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"86 knew about the energies and wanted to use them, and others considered these energies and sites to be evil and wished to suppress the energies (the ‘dragon’). This is where I feel the legends of St George and the dragon originated. Churches all over the world are built on acupuncture points and chakras and I visit many in the course of my own work. All that fear, guilt, and suffering which has been experienced on those sites and the concentration on the crucifixion have generated immense quantities of negative energy and this has poured into the grid. Those churches that have been joyous have produced positive energy, but they have been the tiny, tiny, minority. This was a terrible time for the volunteers and those who were trying to restore understanding to the human mind. They incar nated in other parts of the world for lives dedicated to channelling energy into the grid to try to compensate for what Christianity and Islam (of which more shortly) were doing. Those who were born into the Christian World lived simple lives keeping their heads down and channelling the energy or doing what they could to speak out before facing the inevitable and often gruesome fate. Many found themselves guided to the monasteries which were built on energy sites and were protected by law from any interference. One spiritual group which grew rapidly in France and Northern Italy in the 12th and 13th centuries and challenged the power of Rome was the Cathars or Albigenses. It was based on an understanding of reincarnation and the eternal nature of all consciousness. They were vegetarians and communicated psychically with other frequencies. Their views won such support that the influence of the Roman Catholic Church began to wane in Southern France around Albi. Pope Innocent II reacted to this with one of the most appalling examples of inhumanity seen on this planet. What followed was genocide. Men, women and children were dismembered or were burnt alive in the name ofJesus and God. The events at the castle of Monsegur are best remembered in the Cathar story, but there were many other ‘glorious’ victories for the Roman Catholic armies that were just as sickening. One ploy of Innocent II, and later of Pope Gregory IX was to tell his ‘crusaders’ that no matter what they did he would forgive them on God’s behalf. What a shock they must have had when they left the physical body and realised they were responsible through karma for all they had done."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"87 As the centuries passed the Holy Inquisition went into overdrive. The Dominican Order was put in charge of this religious version of Murder Incorporated. Pope Gregory IX declared: ‘It is the duty of every Catholic to persecute heretics’. There was no fair trial before a sentence. The Inquisitors, decision was final. It was a wonderful way of getting rid of people you didn’t like, especially if you were one of the Brotherhood elite who wished to remove those who were getting in your way. You told the Inquisitors that your enemies were non- believers, and you stood back and watched them burned to death. This passage is from a book of guidance from the Church to inquisitors: “Either the person confesses and he is proved guilty from his own confession, or he does not confess and is equally guilty on the evidence of witnesses. If a person confesses the whole of what he is accused of he is unquestioningly guilty of the whole; but if he confesses only a part, he ought still to be regarded as guilty of the whole, since what he has confessed proves him to be capable of guilt as to other points of the accusation.. Bodily torture is left to the Judge of the Inquisition, who determines according to age, sex, and the constitution of the party.. If not withstanding, all the means employed, the unfortunate wretch still denies his guilt, he is to be considered as a victim of the devil; and, as such, deserves no compassion from the servants of God, nor pity and indulgence of Holy Mother Church; he is a son of perdition. Let him perish among the damned.” Even genuine believers were murdered by the Inquisitors, but the Church’s motto was that it was better for a hundred ‘innocents’ to die than for one heretic to go on living. Could it be that the Nazis of the 20th century were a reincarnation of these misguided minds I have been describing? The parallells in behaviour patterns and attitudes are clear to see, even in their treatment of the Jews. I believe that the programming by the Church of the collective conscious mind was so strong that when people later reincarnated they dropped back into the same thought patterns that had been programmed into them in previous incarnations. This applies to the Church, economics, and all aspects of our lives, and I have no doubt the same is happening today. In incarnation after incarnation people drop back into old patterns they cannot or chose not to break. It is like the needle stuck in a record groove, although I must say I do feel that some of the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"88 architects of the Church dogma were, as with the Nazi leaders, incarnations of the Luciferic consciousness. I don’t recognise the term heresy. It is, for me, the ultimate arrogance to suggest that certain beliefs must be free from questioning and challenge under the guise of ‘heresy’ or ‘blasphemy’. But if you use for a moment the Church’s definition of heresy - the abuse and misrepresentation of the one they call Jesus - then the greatest of all heresies has been Christianity itself. The Christian thought-police were now established across their domain and they would soon spread their darkness to the Americas. The only threat to their domination of the Holy Land and beyond was another version of religious indoctrination which answered to the name of Islam. The clashes between the two would create yet more conflict, pain, and suffering - exactly what the Brotherhood and its master, Lucifer, wanted to see."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"89 6 Arabian Knights In the year 570 a child was born in the Arabian desert at Mecca. Forty years later he was to have a psychic experience that would affect the course of history to the present day. His name was Mahomet or as he is better known, Mohammed. Again we have a psychic vision, a communication from another frequency, or an extra-terrestrial hologram, being mistaken for God or a messenger from God, and again it was to have appalling consequences. Mahomet said that his communicator had told him the people of Arabia must return to a simple faith in Allah, the God of Abraham (Allah = El and later Jehovah to the Hebrews). He said God had also chosen him to pass on this message, and those who accepted it would be saved on Judgment Day. Sound familiar? All of these apparently opposing religions were started by the same non-physical manipulator - Lucifer in his many forms. Mahomet was just another victim. He wrote down his communications in a book called the Koran (meaning recitation), and from that came the religion we know as Islam (meaning submission to God) and the people called Muslims (one who submits). Terrible violence became the means of advancing Mahomet’s cause. He changed in character from what would appear to have been a kind and loving man into a tyrant as his religious beliefs and a highly negative energy took him over. So what caused this sudden change? It could have been that he simply became power hungry, I suppose, but maybe there is another explanation. I do not offer it as fact, just a possibility. Mahomet says that he saw his vision near the cave where he would often go. The vision apparently claimed to be the angel Gabriel of biblical fame and he lost consciousness during the encounter. Other prophet figures have told of similar experiences. When he woke up the message he was told to recite was, he says, inscribed upon his heart. Perhaps it would have been more accur ate to say his mind. To"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"90 appreciate what could have happened to Mohamet, St Paul, Augustine, and endless others, we need to make the division in our minds between the stage of evolution humanity had reached at the time and where the ET’s were in their knowledge and technology. In the modern world, highly sophisticated, mind-control techniques are well known to the secret Brotherhood elite today and the intelligence agencies who work to an agenda which ignores democratic government and scrutiny. But even these techniques are primitive compared with what the ETs can do and, more to the point, could do thousands of years ago across the entire period covered in this book. They could turn certain people into super robots, controlled almost entirely through mind programming. The CIA today have the ability to abduct someone, implant a micro-chip in their brain, and so hypnotise them that another version of what happened can replace the actual experience in their memory. Look at the difference between that level of knowledge and the stage of understanding humans had reached in the periods we are discussing and you can see how easy it would have been to control many events. I am not saying that this happened, I don’t know. But it would be naive to dismiss the possibility out of hand, in the light of what we know about mind-controlling techniques today. Humans, rather than ETs, could well have been involved in affecting Mohamet’s mind. There are, of course, other explanations for his experience. The most likely is some sort of psychic happening or manipulation, or even drugs. Maybe he was genuinely the subject of efforts to pass on spiritual knowledge and his ego took over. Part of the message he wrote down said: “Don’t use violence in religion,” only for this to be removed from the Koran texts when he did just that. There is a great deal of good sense to be found in the Koran among all the dross. What precisely happened to Mohamet, we can’t say, but one thing is for sure - what followed his experience was anything but spiritual. Even before Mohamet the town of Mecca was considered a religious centre and attracted thousands of pilgrims. It had a small temple called the Kaaba (House of God) and its cornerstone was a meteorite. This was held to be sacred and the place of worship for the god Allah Taala and images ofJesus, Mary, and others decorated the walls. The Bedoums who owned the temple enjoyed a very profitable business as the people paid to worship and kiss the sacred stone. They became very angry at the preachings of homet because if his"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"91 ideas caught on they feared their trade would cease. To their dismay he was gathering many followers and the town of Medina had asked him to be their ruler as the prophet of Allah. Given what has happened since, it is some irony to think that it was the Jews in Medina who helped to pursuade people that he was who he claimed to be. The Bedoums of Mecca plotted to kill him, but he escaped with his close friend Abu Bekr and hid in his cave before returning to the safety of Medina in 622. Medina translates as ‘town of the Prophet’. From his base in Medina he and his followers attacked and robbed the trading caravans on their way to Mecca and conflict came to this desert region. Mahomet’s growing power and arrogance led him to announce that God had told him the people in Medina who would not accept his message should be killed. It was Christianity revisited. All non-believers must die. Mahomet ordered many massacres, including the murder of 900 Jews, and in the end a treaty was agreed between Mecca and Medina. Mecca would recognise Mahomet as the prophet of God if he moved the centre of the faith from Medina to Mecca. In this way the temple would lose one faith, but gain another, and although the pilgrims would now come for different reasons, they would still come and keep the tills ticking over. No doubt with commercial benefits in mind, the Bedoums also insisted that Mahomet tell the people to face Mecca and not Jerusalem when they prayed. This would increase their desire to visit the place they were facing several times a day. Fourteen hundred years later Moslems across the world still face the direction of Mecca when they pray. Mahomet went to war with any community throughout Arabia who would not accept his rule and his claims to be the prophet of God. This turned a region of communities into a nation determined to spread their new creed throughout the world by whatever means were necessary. I have to smile when I hear Moslem religious leaders speaking on the radio, and every time they say the ‘The Prophet Mohammed’ they follow immediately with ‘peace and blessings upon him’. I am all for peace and blessings on everyone, including those who Mahomet and his followers murdered in the name of God and those still kept in mental and physical bondage by Moslem fanatics today. Women particularly have suffered in the Moslem world from the beliefs of Mahomet which have made them prisoners in their own lands when the Koran is followed to the letter."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"92 With Mahomet’s death at the age of 62, his friend Abu Bekr took over as his Kalifa or Caliph which means successor. He was ruthless in pursuit of his desire for world domination by Islam and the rivers of blood flowed across the Middle East. Every country was given the same ultimatum: accept the Caliph as their ruler and adopt the Moslem faith, or die by the sword. By the year 750, Moslem rule had advanced dramatically. It now controlled Arabia, Egypt, the North African Coast, Armenia, Syria, Palestine, Persia, Mesopotamia, and Spain. This gave them control of the Christian ‘Mecca’ of Jerusalem and many other places the Christians believed to be sacred. In time Constantinople, the first Christian city, would also fall. The Moslems were to adopt the crescent as their emblem, but this was originally designed by the Christians of Constantinople and only became associated with Islam after the city was taken. The Moslem Empire would later extend to the Indian subcontinent where the deep and bitter hatred thus created between Moslems and Hindus still continues. It is the old, old, familiar story. We have all the answers and if you don’t accept that, you are dead. One can only speculate at the mental age necessary to think in such terms, or the power of the mental control someone or something has over them. When anyone tells you they have all the answers it is time to race for the exits. You will see through the story of religions that certain key themes are common to them all. First someone channels a non-physical communicator or meets the occupant of a spacecraft and takes them to be whatever version of God their belief system will accept. A fanatical zeal unfolds to impose these beliefs on everyone else and as time goes on and the original instigator dies, feuds break out over power, money, position, and ‘truth’. So it was with the Moslem Faith. Arguments began over who should be the Caliph in the centuries that followed. A man called Othman was chosen on one occasion, but this was resented by Ah, the husband of Mahomet’s daughter, Fatima. Ah believed he should have been Caliph because he was a member of the Prophet’s family and Othman was not. There was tremendous conflict between the two factions and it is still going on in some areas to this very day. The Shute, or orthodox Moslems, believe they descend from those who said Ah should be caliph while the others, called Sunni Moslems, recognise Othman. God help us. At one time anyone who could claim to descend from Mahomet was executed and once again I’m sure the negative"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"93 Brotherhood organisations were stimulating the division whenever they could. There were, and are, however, many good things about Moslem rule. This is an important point which I want to stress most strongly. In all these books, like the Bible and Koran, you will find among the incitements and justifications for horrific behaviour some good and virtuous philosophies. The fanatics who, by force, have largely been in control have picked out the former to guide their lives, but others have had the sense and decency of spirit to be guided by the latter. Not every believer in Christianity was a murdering barbarian and nor every Moslem. Across the world today there are hundreds of millions of faithful Christians and Moslems who follow the positive messages in their religious books and reject the violence. There are some wonderful human beings working within the Christian Church and, as I have found in Britain and in my travels through the Middle East, you will not find a kinder, more generous people than the moderate, thinking, Moslems. If they and the moderate Christians had been in control over the centuries then although they would still be following what are, in my view, religions based on myth, at least the slaughter fields would not have been thought necessary. There were periods in the Moslem empire when the fanatics were not in control and these times made a vital contribution to humanity by preserving the knowledge of people like Plato and Aristotle. Under the caliph Haroun-al-Raschid in the late eighth, early ninth, century the capital was moved to Baghdad. Their thought was not imprisoned by the Koran and although the caliph still sent his armies to pillage and murder appallingly in neighbouring lands, he also set up schools and colleges. Scientists, doctors, and philosophers travelled to this centre of intellectual freedom. Baghdad became the world’s wealthiest city with many hospitals, more than 600 doctors and 6,000 students. All religions were allowed to be followed freely. When Al-Mamun took over from his father, the Greek, Persian and Chaldean literature which had survived the Christian priests was translated into Arabic. He openly questioned the teachings of the Koran and encouraged philosophy. In this period great advances were made in the understanding of science and healing and an extensive system of schools was created for children. The Moslem world was light years ahead of Christendom where all these things, including healing, were banned on pain of death. In Southern Spain under Moslem rule it was the same as in Baghdad. Their way of thinking"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"94 and living was in a different world to the squalor and ignorance which prevailed throughout Christendom. We have much to thank the Moslems, for under these more open-minded rulers, they kept the flame of knowledge alive and it paved the way for the Renaissance in Europe. The glories of Baghdad as a home of knowledge and mental freedom were crushed when the Turks invaded in the 11th century. These were orthodox, fanatical, Moslems and intolerance and ignorance returned. I say orthodox, fanatical, Moslems, but the division of attitude should really be broken down into fanatics and thinkers. The Moslem fanatics had the same mentality as the Christian fanatics and had each been born in the other’s land they would have been equally fanatical about the other’s religion. We speak of Moslems and Christians, but it’s not like that in reality. It is fanatics and thinkers. The religions are simply used as a vehicle for fanaticism. If they did not exist, they would find another expression for their mental and emotional imbalances. In the same way, if the moderate, thinking, people did not have a religion through which to express their spirituality, they would find another vehicle for it. The Turks went on to create the Ottoman Empire, a name which came from Osman, one of their rulers. Its expansion into hitherto Christian lands was helped by the latest arguments over the trinity. Now they were falling out over the Latin word Fihoque, which means ‘and from the Son’. Did the Holy Ghost proceed only from the Father or from the Father ‘and from the Son’? Does anyone care? Unfortunately they do, and when the Filioque was added to the creed by the Pope in 1054 it split the Western and Eastern Churches. This Eastern Church is now known as the Greek or Eastern Orthodox. There was a definite Brotherhood ploy to now split the Christian religion into factions of conflict. While Christendom was arguing about all this, the Moslem Turks were taking advantage and expanding their empire into Christian strongholds. The Pope sought to bring unity of purpose by launching a crusade against the Moslems to win back control of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre from the ‘infidels’. There were eight crusades in all and Jerusalem was won and then lost again. The urgency to regain the Holy City was increased by the belief that the Second Coming would happen soon. In fact the idea of the Saviour-god returning goes back to the days of Sun Worship and is common to many religions. Most of the crusades"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"95 were a disaster and on one occasion the Church organised an army made up of children from France and Germany in an effort to re-take Jerusalem. This ‘Children’s Crusade’ was launched during the Papacy of Innocent III. Few of the children returned. Most were victims of disease, accident, murder, and slavery. The Crusades were responsible for the most staggering violence and the ‘Knights of Chivalry’ were no more than barbarous killing machines. The European kings and knights were urged by the Church and the Brotherhood societies to kill for God. Two branches of the Brotherhood most active at this time were the Knights Templar (or Knights of the Temple) and the Knights Hospitaler. The latter was probably not under Brotherhood Control from its creation in 1048. It was then a charitable order, but in 1118 it had another incarnation as the Order of Knights Hospitaler of St John. This came after a change of leadership and motivation. They became a military organisation named after John, the son of the King of Cyprus, who fought in the Crusades. It would seem to have been a Brotherhood take over and the Order began to operate with a Grand Master and all the rituals, secret initiations, rituals, and symbols, which go back to ancient times. The Knights Templar were a Brotherhood branch from the start, with their Grand Master and customary secrecy. They came into being a year after the Hospitalers joined the Brotherhood and the Templars were to have enormous power behind the scenes. Like the Hospitalers they were given large amounts of money by supporters of the Crusades and the Templars became so rich they began the financial centres in Paris and London by storing their wealth in their temples in those cities. The Teutonic (German) Knights were another charitable order who changed to a military role. They had a Grand Master and all the trimmings and these three Brotherhood branches hated each other, much to the delight of those who were controlling them without their knowledge. Again I am not saying that every member of these groups was knowingly working against the people. Most would have had the best of intentions. The Brotherhood doesn’t work like that. It needs to hoodwink most of its own to be most effective. The Brotherhood is manipulation with a smile on its face and it seeks a good public image. For that it needs some good people involved at the lower levels. Charitable trusts and charity work in general is often a front it chooses to use. Even on the journeys to the ‘Holy Land’ by the Christian Crusaders"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"96 other non-believers on route were tortured and murdered. The Jews suffered most. The Christians condemned the whole Jewish Race as the ‘murderers of Christ’ and any scale of barbarity against them could be justified by that. When the crusaders of the Lord re-took Jerusalem one of their first acts was to burn the synagogue with the Jews still inside. The streets literally ran with the blood of their Jewish and Moslem victims, a great contrast to the way some Moslem leaders treated the Christians when Islam regained the city. In the end the crusades achieved nothing, except for sending hundreds of thousands to an early grave and causing terrible pain and destruction - exactly what the Brotherhood wanted. It was not until this century that the Christian world had control of the Holy Land again, when it became part of the British Empire. The Jews suffered in Europe for another reason. The Christian religion in this period imposed a strict ban on usury, the charging of interest on loans. An usurer could have all his property confiscated, be excommunicated, and refused a Christian burial. It was considered better that a wife should leave an usurer husband and beg for food, than to accept anything from him. The Jews were not subject to this Christian law and they did change interest on lending. This made them extremely unpopular with people in debt. In 1290, 16,000 Jews were deported from England because of this. At the end of the Crusades and the Moslem victory, the Brotherhood knights had to flee. The Order of St John did well, as it moved around, changing its name with its location as the Knights of Rhodes and Knights of Malta. They have survived to this day as the Sovereign and Military Order of Malta, which, with papal help, moved its base to Rome and became the world’s smallest nation. The Knights of Malta have tremendous influence in politics and in the secret societies today. The Templars have also survived, but the reprisals against them for losing the crusades, and the charges aimed against them for spitting on the cross and homosexuality saw their wealth and power taken away. (For a while, anyway). The reasons for this campaign against them were greed and the preservation of the con-trick called Christianity. The Templars accumulated breathtaking riches as Christians gave their wealth to them in their wills and donations. The Templars were the richest organisation in every country in which they established themselves. They became bankers without charging interest because the Christian Church had a ban on usury. When the Jews were expelled"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"97 from France in 1306 for their usury activities, Philip, the French King, had to re-pay his debts to them. This he did by giving them virtually all his country’s reserves of coinage in exchange for all the property they left behind. This was similar to the deal struck between the Jews and King William (Rufus) when they were thrown out of England for charging interest on loans. King Philip was desperate for money to meet foreign commitments and he decided to steal the Templar gold. Philip and his fellow Frenchman, Pope Clement V, hatched a plan to achieve it. Allegations were made against the Templars and Clement charged them with heresy. Their money went to Philip and their lands to the church. The Templar’s Grand Master, Jacques de Moley, was burned at the stake. But there was another reason why the Roman Catholic Church was so keen on destroying the Templars and the Cathars. In 1891 during restoration of the village church at Rennes4e-Chateau in South-West France, the parish priest, Berenger Sauniere, found four parchments. They were sealed in wooden tubes which had been hidden inside a hollow altar pillar. Two of these contained the blood lines of local families and dated back to 1244 and 1644. Sauniere also discovered a secret code in the texts and he told the Bishop of Carcassonne what he had found. With that the parish priest was summoned to Paris to meet the church hierarchy and show them the parchments. From that time, Sauniere was a man transformed. He would have earned a very small income as a priest, but in the years that followed he spent millions on paintings, antiques and rare china. He also built a mansion which he never lived in and a tower so close to the side of a mountain that it overlooked nothing. His behaviour became very strange in all sorts of ways. When a new Bishop of Carcassonne was appointed and complained at Saunie re’s antics, the parish priest was supported by the Pope himself Sauniere died of ‘a stroke’ in 1917 at the age of sixty-five. But it seems that his coffin had been ordered by his housekeeper five days before his ‘stroke’, when he had seemed perfectly healthy. A priest who came to give him the last rites and heard his confession was said to have left the room visibly shaken and never to have smiled again. So what did Sauniere know?

One mentioned a secret order structured on typical Brotherhood lines called the Priory of Sion which had also been named in the parchments found by Saumere in Rennes4e-Chateau. Lincoln’s document said that past Grand Masters of this order included Leonardo da Vinci, the scientist Isaac Newton, the alchemist, Nicholas Flamel, and the composer, Claude Debussy. The plot thickened because Saumere had met Debussy when he was summoned to Paris by the Roman Catholic hierarchy. The Priory of Sion, the document went on, was the inner hierarchy of the Knights Templar which were dedicated to restoring the Merovingians to the French Throne. The Merovingian dynasty began in the 5th century. Merovee became Frankish King in 448 and the family were said to have royal or holy blood. The Templars had a stronghold at Bezu not far from Rennes4e-Chateau, and remember, the parchments found by Saumere included family blood lines. This becomes extremely relevant and links in perfectly with my earlier conclusions about the Jesus story when you consider the following. Henry Lincoln’s work was the subject of three television documentaries in 1972 and as a result he received a letter from a retired Anglican priest. The letter said that the writer knew for certain that what Saumere found was uncontestable proof that Jesus did not die on the cross. The priest said that he was given this information by a fellow Anglican cleric who had worked in Paris with Emile Hoffet. When Sauniere was ordered to Paris, one of those who interviewed him was Emile Hoffet. Lincoln’s informant said the parchments proved that Jesus was alive in France at least until 45AD . As I suggested earlier, Jesus travelled to the Rennes- leChateau area with Mary Magdalene and their children after he had recovered from the crucifixion. He may have died there or p05sibly he could have ended his life in Kashmir, as I mentioned earlier. I believe the Roman Catholic Church know that Jesus did not die on the cross and have done so for at least 1500 years. They have suppressed this knowledge to protect their own power. They have conned billions of people over the centuries and continue to do so today. The proof of this is locked up in the Vatican vaults and, as Sauniere found out, they will pay any sort of price to persist with this monumental lie. They will also commit genocide to preserve their deceit. King Philip may have had money as his motivation to destroy the Knights"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"99 Templar after the failed Crusades, but Pope Clement V had other reasons for his own involvement. The Templars knew the true story of Jesus, just as the Cathars had done when they emerged in the same region of France which includes Rennes-leChateau. The Cathars had also denied that Jesus died on the cross and they were eliminated for that reason more than any other. I feel the much talked-about Cathar ‘treasure’ was the proof that Jesus survived the cross. This story goes on to this day because the Brotherhood elite is still determined to crown a ‘World King’ who descends from the bloodline ofJesus, something they inherited via the Templars, who believed that the Merovingians decended from the blood line of King David, through Jesus and his children. This is why they were so keen to put the Merovingians back on the French throne, and this was another incentive for King Philip to be rid of them. It was thought the Merovingian blood line had died out after they lost the Frankish throne in the 8th century, but the Cathars and the Templars knew differently. Today, somewhere in the world, the Brotherhood, or some elements of it, are possibly preparing a person who they claim to be from the David, Jesus, Merovingian, blood line to become ‘World King’. Everything and everyone is expendable to those who control the Brotherhood once their use to them has run its course. There is no better example of that than the way the Brotherhood was manipulating its Christian branches to fight the Moslems, while doing the same to its Moslem branches to fight the Christians. Among these Moslem Brotherhood groups were the Karmathites, the Druses, the Brotherhood of the Nine, and the Assassins. At the heart of the secret societies of the Moslem world was the Grand Lodge of Cairo from where many Brotherhood groups in Europe originated. As with all religions the original structure breaks up into factions, as with the Shutes. Out of the Shutes came another faction called the Ismaili Sect, a Brotherhood Branch with the Aga Khan as its ‘spiritual leader’ today, and out of that came yet another arm of the Brotherhood, the Assassins - Grand Master, secret initiations, you know the score. The word Assassin means a user of hashish because they used the drug to stimulate their mystical experiences and for other more sinister reasons. Now assassin means something very different - a lone killer. This is because the Assassins used this method very effectively to expand their power from their base in Iran. They were not choosy. They killed Moslem and Christian alike."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"100 The Assassins became a model for the political and economic murders of today. They would not do the killing themselves, they would mind control a young man and get him to do it. Their preferred method was to introduce him to the Grand Master. He would then be drugged with hashish and lose consciousness. When he awoke he would be in a beautiful garden and there he would be pampered and led to believe he was in heaven, paradise. He would be given more of the drug, lose consciousness again, and wake up back with the Grand Master. The killer-to-be would be told that he had never left the Grand Master’s presence and that he had been given a taste of the eternal paradise that would await him if he did as he was told by the Assassins and killed for God. They invariably did. Could something along these lines have happened to Mahomet centuries earlier? This same basic technique, but now far more sophisticated, is used today to murder those who get in the way of the Brotherhood’s plan for world domination. This method of mind controlling outsiders to do your dirty work makes it almost impossible to identify the real killers, especially when those investigating the crime are also Brotherhood members, more often than not. The Moslem secret societies indoctrinated and conned their initiates in ways that also mirrored the other branches of the Brotherhood, like the freemasons. The lower degrees of initiation were quite straightforward and appeared to support the status quo, the Moslem religion in their case. But then, at a certain level when the initiate was well entrenched in the society, the whole story was switched and suddenly they were told to forget all they had been told before. The new version of the ‘truth’, which itself would undergo other changes at the higher levels of initiation, would lead to the revelation of who or what the society was really serving. Only if it was believed beyond doubt that you could be trusted to support the ‘Great Work’ would you be given this knowledge. This is how the few can use the majority of their members as a front of respectability for their clandestine activities against freedom. If you are a freemason or a member of any secret society, you are almost certainly being conned, and it is time you realised that. Get out while you can. The Assassins, by the way, were overrun by the invading Mongols under the leadership of Mangu Khan in 1250, but their attitude to life very much lives on.

Europe was in chaos and turmoil after the Romans left, but over the centuries certain tribes gained dominance and countries began to emerge. A Frankish tribe took over the lands we now call France and a branch of this settled in what became Germany. In Britain, they were ruled by a series of invaders, among them the Vikings, Saxons and the Normans. Theirs was also a story of imposition, invasion, political and religious conflict, and constant Brotherhood activity. A title was never so apt than the Dark Ages.

As we have seen, nothing could be further from the truth. It sought to crush all efforts to bring civilisation to the Dark Ages it had created. Part of its propaganda is to lump all pre-Christians together as ‘pagans’ and therefore heathens and savages. This is another abuse of truth. Yes, there were people in the pre-Christian world who behaved in terrible ways, but none was any worse than those who imposed Christianity. And to say that all pre-Christians were ‘heathens’ is supreme arrogance. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Quintilion, were heathens? The very thought is hysterical. You simply cannot divide generations and civilisations into heathen and enlightened, or good and bad. Within all civilisations, no matter how negative their overall effect, are positive people trying to do what their heart is telling them. During the worst excesses of Christianity there were many compassionate people who followed the creed, and it was the same with Islam and other religions. So it has been throughout human history. We look back on those who peopled the Earth in the thousands of years before Christianity and believe them to be stupid savages; yet the understanding of life and creation among many of their number was more advanced than the modern world in many ways. Their most enlightened members, often incarnations of the volunteer consciousness supported by channelled information, knew that the Earth was alive with a mind of her own. They knew of the energy system and the sacred points. The ancient Chinese applied this knowledge to the human body in what has become known as acupuncture. The ancients built the stone circles and erected standing"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"103 stones on the chakras and acupuncture points of the Earth. Many of them have an effect similar to acupuncture needles. These great structures, like Stonehenge in England, are said to be the cultish monuments of a backward people, and yet what they put into place is still at work today helping to keep the battered energy grid in some kind of order. They were excellent channellers because they were not subjected to the tidal wave of abuse, derision, and condemnation from their society when their psychic gifts were activated as children. Their parents did not say ‘Don’t be silly’, when they saw visions of entities on other frequencies or heard their communications; so they did not shut down these channels through fear and confusion. Naturally they were subjected to manipulation and I’m sure that some of the standing stones and circles were put there for negative reasons, too, to disrupt the energy flows or even to concentrate the energies at certain points to allow the spacecraft to use the power for their activities. Not every stone circle is positive, but overall these ancient peoples had some idea of the Earth as a living, breathing, entity. I feel that the land we now call the British Isles was part of Atlantis before the series of cataclysms began to disconnect this land from the island that Atlantis was to become. Britain has always been recognised as an area of enormous importance to the grid. Despite the efforts of people like Boadicea, the Britons could not hold out against the Roman invasion. Although Julius Caesar’s attempted invasion was eventually repelled, the Roman Empire absorbed most of Britain a few years later after the year 43. They never did succeed in suppressing most of the people of Scotland and a wall would be built by the Emperor Hadrian to keep them out. Christianity would later do what the Romans could not do take control of all Scotland. The rule of the Romans had many benefits. The inter-tribal wars diminished and roads were built to improve communications. After the fall of the Roman Empire in 410 the islands of Britain were invaded by tribes from the regions we know as Germany and Denmark. The inter-breeding of the indigenous population and the invaders created the Anglo-Saxon race. It was in these Anglo-Saxon times that the process of losing the ancient knowledge really began to accelerate. The country was broken up into the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. They fought over yes, you’ve got it religion. The supporters of the Nicene Creed fought with those who supported the Anus view of Jesus, while the pagans fought"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"104 with both both of them. Oswy, the Christian king of Northumbria, ‘did a Constantine’ in 664, when he called the two Christian factions together at Whitby; after hearing the arguments he decided that all England would follow the Pope and the Nicene Creed. The foundations were now set for the Church to rule the country. The rule of the Roman emperor had been replaced by the rule of the Roman pope, so it was throughout the former Roman Empire. Now the manipulators only had to control the papacy as they controlled most of the known world. As the very mention of the socalled pagan knowledge became the equivalent of suicide in the Christian world, the information about energies and energy sites was passed on in legends by those who wished to preserve the basic truths. They talked in codes about giants and sacred hills and wells, and the ‘giants’ could even have some extra-terrestrial background, too. These stories can still be found in local folklore today, and because they are taken literally the originators are looked upon as backward people. When you decode the symbolism you can see that they were far from backward. They were merely trying to pass on knowledge in ways that would not get them executed by those who were backward - the representatives of the Christian religion. There was conflict all over Europe, with village fighting village at any excuse, and the culture brought by the Romans was largely destroyed. The chaos throughout the former Roman Empire developed into a form of control called feudalism, which was to create the social structure on which Europe developed for centuries to come. Groups of weaker people would gathered behind a strong personality (not necessarily an enlightened one by any means), and all who followed him and did whatever he asked were given his protection. The division had arrived between the freeman and the bondsman, those who were no more than slaves. The leaders would become known as the lord or the king and they were considered to be the representatives of God. The noblemen were the upper classes. Christianity was one of the main instigators and supporters of this system which turned most people into the slaves of the few and it was the. same across Europe. The kings and noblemen took over the land, and they gave great wealth to the Church in their misguided belief, encouraged by the Church, that they were buying a place in heaven. The feudal manor or the monastery was now the authority which the communities of serfs had to obey. In time Britain was"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"105 divided into shires ruled by ealdormen (later known as earls), and under them were the thegns (later barons). These, along with the most powerful priests, became the nobility. It is from these beginnings and the creation of slaves that the class system emerged which is still with us today, with its landed gentry, nobility, Church and clergy, separated from the mass of the people by either wealth or privilege, often both. All this was dreamland for the negative Brotherhood sects. What a perfect system to manipulate, playing one against the other to create conflict and upheaval, using this to change the world in your image. These kingdoms and communities would fight and battle with each other until one or a few would become dominant and take over large areas of land which would develop into a country. Wessex became dominant in England when it defeated the Mercians in 825 and King Egbert of Wessex controlled all of England. He was, in effect if not name, the first English king. Ethelwulf followed, and then came Alfred the Great. He was by far the most enlightened ruler of his time encouraging, among other things, the translation of Latin literature into English. Through it all the Church prospered. Kingdoms and nobles may come and go, but the Church was always there, adding with every dying king and noble to its now breathtaking fortune of land and riches. Christianity was now in control of England, and so was the Brotherhood. This control would strengthen even further after the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Harold, the English King, was faced with invasions from the Danes and the Normans. He defeated the Danes at the Battle of Stamford Bridge near York and marched his troops south to tackle William, Duke of Normandy, a ruthless man who was very close to Pope Alexander II. The Pope, William, and brotherhood societies plotted the invasion of England and the Papacy supplied the funds. William believed he was doing it for God and he carried the Pope’s banners into battle, just as the pagan armies had carried images of their gods into the fray. Nothing had changed except the emblem. William defeated the English army and became king. Now the Pope would have a subservient England along with France and Germany. French became the language of England and this gradually fused with the various other languages spoken on the islands, Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Danish, to create the English tongue we recognise today. William ordered the production of the Doomsday Book which"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"106 recorded the ownership of every house, animal, and acre of land for taxation purposes and he gave great areas of England to the Church to pay back the Pope for his support of the invasion. Lanfranc, an Italian Prior, was brought over from his abbey in Normandy to be made Archbishop of Canterbury and administer the Church’s land and other wealth. It was he who organised a system of tithes to be paid to the Church by every landowner in the country. Even the poorest were not exempt and they paid up in their ignorance and fear that the priests could consign them to hell forever more. To this day the landowners of England still have to pay this tithe to the Church, even if they think that Christianity is a load of baloney. Opposition in the 1930s would change the nature of the payment, but it is still paid in another way. In 1936 the tithes were replaced by a fixed annual payment to be charged until October 1996. These fees are to pay for the three per cent of Government stock handed over to the Church authorities in exchange for them conceding their right to the tithes. This means, of course, that we are all paying for the Church in the costs added by the landowners to the price of their produce. All this because the priests frightened people through violence or hell and damnation into handing over their lands during a period of nearly a thousand years. Through all this period of English and world history and in the following centuries, enlightened and courageous people were trying to raise the level of consciousness and knowledge. It is difficult to pick out which of them were genuinely seeking freedom for the people and which were working to a Brotherhood agenda, undermining religion in the longer term to bring about a world that accepted only the physical level of being. I think at least the great majority had good intent, and if they were playing the Brotherhood’s game, it was probably mostly by ignorance, not malice. Roger Bacon, an English Franciscan friar of the 13th century wrote that people should cease to be ruled by dogma and authority and think for themselves. He had an advanced understanding for his time of science and he was confined by the Church because of his views. Others followed and their numbers grew until it exploded into the period called the Renaissance or ‘new birth’. The key to what followed was the coming of the printing press to Europe. The means to make paper had been discovered by the Chinese, taken on by the Moslems and, though them, reached the Italians. The idea of printing with movable type also goes back to China and in the 1470s William"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"107 Caxton was setting up his printing press in Westminster and producing the first book by this method in England. Caxton translated books from French and Latin into English and the exchange of knowledge began to flow all over Europe, although the Church would seek to suppress this at every turn. The Renaissance in art, literature, and knowledge began chiefly in Italy from its stronghold in Florence. Greeks were seeking refuge in Italy from the Turks and they brought with them their knowledge, language and books. The learning of the Greek language had been banned by the Roman Catholic Church to stop people reading the works of the Greek philosophers, but now the ban was being ignored by those thirsting for knowledge. The spread of Greek literature reached England, France, and Germany. When the Turks took Constantinople there was an exodus of Greeks to Italy with yet more books, manuscripts, and knowledge. The works of the Moslem scientists and the knowledge gathered at the time of the open-minded rulers in Baghdad found its way to Italy and Europe. The volunteer consciousness and the other levels were doing all they could to bring about the breakthrough in knowledge that would undermine the power of the Church. Vittorino da Feltre pioneered a new educational system in Italy which offered his students all the knowledge available, not only that which the Church wished to impose. The obvious corruption, vice, and violence of the Church was reducing its authority and then came the Great Schism when there were two popes, one ruling from Rome and the other from Avignon. This came about because the Italian Church believed that only an Italian should be pope and for thirty-eight years there were two popes, each with their own army plundering and pillaging wherever they went. The discovery of America reduced Italy’s importance as a trading centre and places like Venice and Genoa diminished in their wealth and power. The poverty this brought to Italy dimmed the fires of change and slowly the Church reimposed its grip, especially after Christian Spain occupied Northern Italy in 1538. The Church compiled an index on all banned literature which comprised, of course, of everything that challenged its doctrines. The Inquisition increased its work rate. But much as the Roman Church tried to close the door again on knowledge, changes were now inevitable. There had been growing discontent with the ex cesses of the papacy and the priests. he papacy went to the highest bidder. The post gave"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"108 the occupant control of incredible wealth and real estate. Kings bowed to the power of Rome and the inquisition secured the submission of the masses. The Church also supported the feudal system of masters and serfs. The reaction against all this had been a long time coming. The pressure for change had gathered slowly, and then more quickly through these centuries of fear and subservience. The bubonic plague called the Black Death was dramatically to reduce the population of the world, and in Europe alone about a quarter of the population died. I have seen it speculated that the Black Death and other plagues might have been created by a version of extra-terrestrial germ warfare. Certainly it would seem that bright lights in the sky and foul smelling mists were reported quite often before the plague struck a community. Reports of ‘comets’ at that time could easily have been spacecraft, and historians have written of comets trailing behind them gases that killed trees and the lands fertility. We now often symbolise death with a picture of a skeleton holding a scythe; this comes from the numerous reports across Europe of strange men in black holding ‘scythes’ who appeared in a town or village before people fell ill with the black death. What were these ‘scythes’? Whatever the cause of the plague, it did have a long term impact in changing the status quo. There were now fewer people to do the work of their masters and their dependence on the serfs that were available increased. The supply and demand of labour had tilted towards the serfs and the downtrodden began to protest against their conditions. Sometimes their leaders were assassinated, but the protests continued and there were peasant revolts in many countries, which brought conflict, upheaval, pain and suffering. The centuries of blind and mass obedience to the Church and its masters were being questioned during this period from the 14th to 17th centuries. Events and the growth of knowledge was beginning the process ofliberation from Church control, a process that is only reaching fruition today in what you might call the Spiritual Renaissance or the Light Age. The Church was an obvious target for change and courageous people stood up and challenged it. John Wycliffe condemned the behaviour of the priests who were using information gathered at confessions to blackmail people; some priests were selling forgiveness of sin for money or possessions. Wycliffe advocated that the scriptures were the only foundation of religious knowledge and"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"109 that the pope was not the head of the Church. He dismissed the idea of transubstantiation - the belief that bread and wine can be converted into the body and blood of Christ during the Eucharist ceremony. He had the Bible translated into English and sent out supporters to expound his views. The priests would later persuade Henry IV to authorise the burning of all heretics, including Wycliffe’s supporters. By then he had died, but the priests had his bones exhumed from a churchyard in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, where he had been had been parish priest. They did not want his skeleton polluting holy ground. The more Rome sought to deal violently with protesters, the more protests they had to deal with. The coming of the printing press brought the translation and distribution of the Bible to a much wider audience. Up until then, the masses had only the word of the priests to tell them what the Bible said and meant. But as it was made more widely available people began to see the difference between the simple lives of the Bible ‘heroes’ and the opulent lifestyles of the clergy who were taking ten per cent of all the wealth the people produced. They could begin to re-interpret the texts for themselves. The Church knew the consequences of this and among their desperate efforts to suppress knowledge of the Bible’s true content was to murder by burning at the stake, William Tyndale. His heresy had been to begin to translate the New Testament into English. When people did have the opportunity to read the Bible there was a desire for a return to the simplicity of the Scriptures and the Protestant movement began. This brought about the Reformation when the Protestants broke away from the Catholic Church. Martin Luther was one of the early Protestant leaders. He lived in Germany, which was then composed of over three hundred states. In 1517, this professor of theology at Wittenberg University pinned up a piece of paper containing ninety-five complaints against the behaviour of Rome, in its efforts to raise money to build the church of St Peter’s, on what had been the site of a pagan temple. The new church was, itself, built to make money in much the same way as the bedoums of Mecca fleeced the pilgrims. This attitude continues in the Vatican City today. Pope Julius II and his successor Leo X sanctioned a plan to sell divine pardons for money. For each donation they promised to release from purgatory the soul of a dead relative or friend. As late as the second World War this practice survived, with the Catholic"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"110 Archbishop of Winnipeg telling the wives and parents of Canadian soldiers that, if their loved ones died in action, he would ensure, for a charge of $40, that they went immediately to their maker and stayed with him for all eternity. The revolt against Rome grew in Germany, and in 1520, Luther burned the decree excommunicating him, along with copies of the Canon Law, the name for the Theodosian Creed which updated the Nicaean Creed. The Lutheran Church was born and many of the peasants supported Luther in the hope that religious change would bring social reform. They backed the wrong man, for he was as much a tyrant as most of the popes and he would later support terrible atrocities against the peasant peoples who wanted only freedom from tyranny. As he once wrote: “Damned be love into the abyss of hell, if it is maintained to the damage of faith.....It is better that tyrants should sin a hundred times against the people than the people should sin once against the tyrants....the ass wants to be thrashed, the mob to be governed by force.” His hatred of reason and opened minded research was equally extreme. In one sermon he said that his followers should throw spit in the face of reason, because she was the Devil’s whore, rotten with the itch of leprosy, and ought to be kept in the toilet. Nice man. He may have complained about papal and clerical indulgences, but like the other Protestants, he still believed the nonsense which Jerome and others had edited into the Bible and all the other inaccuracies that had been in the texts to start with. Other forms of Protestant interpretation of the Bible followed such as Calvinism, the product of the Frenchmen John Calvin. He was as much a dictator as Luther and the Popes. Religion - and the Brotherhood -seem to breed such people. Calvin’s obnoxious creed was to have severe consequences in England and America because it was a major influence on the beliefs of the Puritans, of which more later. Calvin promoted the idea, like Luther, that you could not ensure eternal salvation by the way you lived your life or by ‘good works’. It could only come by faith in Jesus as your saviour. Even the Roman Catholic Church wasn’t quite that extreme, but Calvin went even further. He said that whether we were to be ‘saved’ or not was decided by God before we were born! He called this idea predestination. The chosen few who were selected by God for eternal salvation had a duty, he said, to suppress the sin of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"111 the condemned masses. It was, in other words, a licence for untold slaughter. Protestantism broke into endless creeds, sects, and churches with different beliefs arguing on the vital issues for the future of human kind like the nature of the Trinity and whether Jesus entered the bread and wine consumed during the Eucharist. This comes from a quote attributed to Jesus in the Bible which was, in fact, an addition by one of the many forgers and relates to a pagan belief: “And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, ‘Take, eat, this is my body’. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins’.” Over the interpretation of this forgery whole wars were fought. The Protestant Movement came to England in a rather unusual way. Henry VIII wanted a son and heir, but his first wife Catherine of Aragon could only bear him a daughter, Mary. He decided to divorce her and asked Pope Clement VII to sanction it. He refused. Henry was a committed Catholic and had condemned the Protestants in Europe to such an extent that the Pope had awarded him the title Defender of the Faith which British monarchs still hold to this day. This is ironic, because today they are Protestant monarchs defending that faith under a title given by a Roman Catholic pope for defending his faith! You’ve got to chuckle, really. Henry was such a defender of the Catholic faith he ordered that all who denied it were to be burned at the stake. But the opposition to his divorce changed all that. He insisted that his parliament vote into being a Church of England independent of Rome, and he made himself the head of the English Church. When that was done the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, sanctioned his divorce from Catherine. Cranmer replaced Cardinal Wolsey as England’s most influential churchman, because Wolsey had failed to secure his divorce. He was summoned to London to be tried for treason, but died on the way at Leicester Abbey. Wolsey had ruled the English Church like a dictator and had, to a large extent, run the country. The monasteries had enormous power and were home to the papal garrison. They also owned great areas of England. They used the tried and trusted methods like the fear of hell"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"112 to persuade the wealthy to leave them their land and possessions. When that didn’t work they found some excuse to take them. In their early days, the monasteries had made a positive contribution when compared with the murder and misery in other areas of Christendom, but now they were just as bad. Henry had long coveted their wealth and he took his opportunity to abolish them and take their possessions. He was so short of money that he had to sell much of the land he acquired and this was the start of the period of the country squire and gentry. These were the wealthy men who bought the massive estates once owned, or rather stolen, by the Church, and they built upon them their manor houses that have become such a part of the English countryside. Henry waged war on anyone who refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church, as outlined in the Act of Supremacy of 1534. His Cardinal, Sir Thomas More, was beheaded for such treason and there was a bloody purge on Roman Catholics. Henry married six women, two of which he executed. Only Jane Seymour bore him a son, who’ became Edward VI at the age of only nine when Henry died in 1547. Edward was king in name only with the Protestant Duke of Somerset the real power behind the throne. Edward himself died at 15 and he was succeeded by Mary, Henry’s daughter by Catherine of Aragon. She was a staunch Roman Catholic and she began a bloody purge against Protestants which was so savage she was given the name ‘Bloody Mary’. Edward had been persuaded by the Duke of Somerset to leave the throne to Henry’s great grand-daughter, Lady Jane Grey, who was a Protestant supporter, but Mary had her executed and took the throne. Mary married Philip of Spain who wished to have a peaceful relationship with England, so that his ships could pass along the English Channel without hindrance. The Pope again became head of the Church of England. But another about-turn was imminent. With Mary’s death came Elizabeth I, the daughter of Anne Boleyn, and she became queen at the age of 25. Her mother had been a Protestant and she accepted that faith. The Roman Catholic Chnrch opposed her succession because, it said, she was an illegitimate child with her father’s divorce from Catherine of Aragon not recognised by the Pope. She ignored them and restored the Protestant Church of England with herself as its Supreme Head. A bloody purge was launched against Catholics. The Queen ordered the torture and death of so many Irish Catholics they gave her the title ‘Bloody Elizabeth’."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"113 All over Europe mass slaughter was being unleashed as Catholics and Protestants fought against each other in civil and national wars. Which side was most persecuted depended on who had managed to seize the throne at the time. When you look back at the scale of death and destruction committed in the name of religion, even basically the same religion, it is stunning beyond belief. All but a handful of wars have been caused by religion or the perceived superiority of the ancestral line of one group or nation’s physical b6dies, when in truth they are just temporary vehicles for our consciousness to experience this level. But let us take another angle on the events that followed the Reformation. I mentioned earlier that the Brotherhood had a long term aim of using religion for its own ends and then moving on to the next stage, to replace religion, which largely abused the knowledge of the spirit, with a godless science which convinced the mass of the people that the spirit did not even exist. Part of this plan was to dismantle the power of the Roman Catholic Church and create more factions within the Christian religion. Even if they did not actually start the Reformation - and I believe they did - they certainly took advantage of it. The real roots of the Reformation were in Germany in the 14th century when an arm of the Brotherhood emerged called the Illuminati, Latin for the Illuminated or Enlightened Ones. They were closely connected to the Rosicrucians (Latin for the rose and the cross), which began centuries earlier and was introduced to Germany by the Emperor Charlemagne in the ninth century. At one time at least you would be accepted into the Illuminati when you had reached a certain level of initiation in the Rosicrucians. Both were classic secret societies in the manner I have outlined, and they began covertly to introduce a number of religious movements around Europe. One was called the Friends of God led by Rulman Merswin, a rich banker, who was conned by the Brotherhood into believing he had been chosen by God to preach his message because the Pope could no longer be trusted to it. What’s more God would soon punish humanity for its sin, he was told. The End Of The World and the Day of Judgment is another Brotherhood theme. The Friends of God was a mind control cult that accepted only total obedience from its followers. It gained many supporters who were fed up with the corruption in the Roman Catholic Church, and eventually Merswin had a ‘revelation’ that he should hand over his religion lock, stock, and barrel to another branch of the Brotherhood,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"114 probably linked to freemasonry, called the Order of St John. Martin Luther was strongly influenced by some of these German mystical societies and he was especially keen on the writings of the German mystic, Johann Tauler, a man closely connected with the Friends of God. It seems certain, also, that Luther was a Rosicrucian, given that his personal seal contains both of their symbols, the rose and the cross. He was close to many members of the Illuminati and the Rosicrucians, and they would have been using him, with or without his knowledge, to break the overwhelming power of the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican was, itself, a Brotherhood tool, but none is allowed to get too powerful, and all are expendable when the time is right. These two Christian creeds of Protestant and Catholic were now to be used, as we have already seen, to stimulate enormous conflict. But it is important to emphasise that the Brotherhood was not in total control of all events. I am sure they have had some monumental failures in their time, as people have not reacted in the way they expected, or some of their number did not do as they were told once they realised what the game plan was. I have no doubt that some of their wars have not had the outcome they always hoped for. I feel, too, that there have been many periods when the volunteer consciousness has infiltrated these movements and tried to undermine and change them from within and I believe that behind the scenes this was happening during the time of Sir Francis Bacon who became the highest executive of the Rosicrucian Order in England. It was during his lifetime in the early 1 600s that the teachings of the order began to include some references to the need for personal spiritual salvation by taking control of our own thinking and actions, and some of these are still reflected in that order. The fact that someone in history was a member of a secret society tells us nothing. It is the agenda they were working to that matters, and it wasn’t always negative; far from it. What I am sure about, however, is that from the Reformation onwards, the Brotherhood takeover by the Luciferic consciousness was virtually complete, and its power to manipulate events was seen to reach new heights. Elizabeth I secured the long term future of the Episcopalian Church of England, better known as the Anglican Faith. Anyone who didn’t attend local Church services was fined orjailed. It was now that the so called Thirty-Nine Articles of Faith were agreed by Elizabeth and Parliament which everyone had to believe or be condemned as a heretic. I list some of them here and it is worth reading them"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"115 carefully because all would-be Anglican clergy still have to swear their agreement with every word that follows before they are accepted into the priesthood: God consists of three persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who are all one God. Christ was divine and he suffered as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity. Christ died for humanity, was buried and went down into hell. Christ rose from the grave and took again his body, with flesh and bones, with which he ascended to heaven where he sits till he returns on the day of judgment. The Holy Ghost is of the same substance, majesty and glory as the Father and Son. The Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation; everything outside of the scriptures is unnecessary for salvation. Jesus is the only mediator between God and Man. No Christian is free from the obedience of the Commandments. The Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, and the Apostles’ Creed ought to be thoroughly believed. All deserve God’s wrath and damnation, but there is no condemnation of believers who are baptised. Man has no power to do good works without the grace of God. Our righteousness before God comes, not by our works, but by the merit of Christ. Therefore we are justified only by faith and not by works. Good works cannot put away sin, yet they are pleasing to God. Works not springing from faith are not pleasant to God, yet rather they have the nature of sin. Doing more than duty requires cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety. Jesus was sinless, the Lamb without spot who sacrificed himself and took away the sins of the world. Repentance is not denied to such as fall into sin after baptism. Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he has chosen in Christ, to bring them everlasting salvation. They are accursed who believe that every man shall be saved by the Law or who frame their lives according to the light of nature. The effect of Christ’s ordinance is not withdrawn because of the"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"116 officiating priest’s wickedness. All non-believers ought to be considered by the faithful as heathen and publican. This is the faith that to this day is taught by law in the schools of Britain and other countries and is given guaranteed, no questions- asked, air-time by the BBC which claims to be an independent organisation. It is an outrage. If it wasn’t so tragic it would make a comedy series. Elizabeth ensured that the Protestant Faith would survive when her navy defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588. One of the commanders of the English Navy was Francis Drake, a former pirate turned admiral, who was the second man to circumnavigate the world. Philip II of Spain had been urged by Pope Pius V to invade England, kill the ‘bastard’ Queen, and restore the rule of Catholicism. Pius V was the man who was burning, hanging and beheading the religious reformers in Italy. Philip was further motivated in his duty by the terrible atrocities committed against the Catholics of England and Ireland. He believed that such atrocities should only be committed against Protestants. But his Armada was defeated in the English Channel and the power of Rome and Spain was dimmed. The foothold the Protestant Faith had won in Europe was secured. If the Spanish had conquered England the whole Protestant movement might have collapsed. When Elizabeth died in 1603, England and Scotland united under one monarch. They had been in conflict over thousands of years, but now James Vi of Scotland became James I of England, too. The Kingdom was united - on paper at least. The 16th and 17th centuries in England during the reign of Elizabeth and later was a time of great ‘volunteer’ activity as they sought to raise human understanding through art and scientific research. Sir Francis Bacon worked within the secret societies and I have no doubt he wrote the ‘Shakespeare’ plays and included in them esoteric codes. Anthony, the brother of Francis, ran a ‘spy network’ which was a front for passing on esoteric knowledge. I feel that at this time there was a secret society operating within a secret society and that when in the end the Brotherhood realised what was going on the Bacons and others were stopped by a campaign of covert killings and trumped up charges that saw Francis sent to jail. When you look at the life of Sir Francis Bacon nothing is quite what it seems to be on the surface. Every effort to raise the human condition and its understanding of life was viciously"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"117 opposed by the Church, Protestant and Catholic, and so many suffered all over the world for seeking and exchanging knowledge. In 1564, Galileo Galilei was born at Pisa in Italy. He was to develop the use of the telescope to study the skies and his research led him to the conclusion that, contrary to what the Church said, the Sun did not circle the Earth - it was the other way round. Nor did he believe the Earth was the centre of the Universe. This confirmed the findings of Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish scientist who had died in 1543. Copernicus had continued the work begun nearly 2,000 years earlier by Pythagoras and others. Copernicus had been pilloried by the Church for his ‘heresy’ and his work suppressed. Almost a century later the same was to happen to Galileo. It could well be that he was a reincarnation of Copernicus. Galileo was tried for heresy in 1632 by the Inquisition for writing a book supporting the Copernicus theory. A document was falsified by the Church to back up the case against him. He was found guilty of ‘holding and teaching the Copernicus doctrine’ (i.e. saying the Earth goes around the Sun and is not the centre of the Universe). Galileo escaped the most extreme methods of the Inquisition, but he was placed under house arrest for the last eight years of his life. You can see how dogmatic religion has held back human evolution and understanding. It was only in this decade that the Roman Catholic Church officially admitted that Galileo was right!! It is interesting to note that some of his fiercest critics were other academics and scientists who realised the consequences of his findings for their power and influence. The same attitude is still prevalent today. During this period there were many seers and prophets who predicted the future in terms very similar in themes to those being presented today. Nostradamus, who lived in Southern France, is the most famous of them. I feel he was predicting what would happen if humanity continued on the path it had embarked upon. By tuning your consciousness to those vibrations of thought energy that retain Creation’s eternal memory, you can ‘see’ the past with your psychic vision or channel information about it. You can experience something of a past life or see a past event. In the same way you can ‘see’ the future. I believe that consciousness is constantly projecting forward how things will be on the basis of what has happened (the past) and what is happening (the present). From these sources, the collective consciousness projects forward what will happen if those same trends continue. So the future exists as the past exists in thought energy that"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"118 is outside of our version and understanding of space and time. When people tune to that vibration, they are accessing information about the projected future, not necessarily the future as it will be. I believe this was the information that Nostradamus was tuning to for his famous predictions and he was also accessing knowledge of the plan for the transformation of human consciousness in the time we are living in now as we progress into the Photon Beam. Obviously, the closer the event is to the present the more likely it is to happen as projected. But the further into the future you go, the more time there is for humans to change and therefore to change the future. It is a commentary on the scale of humanity’s imprisonment of thought that the outcome is unfolding very much along the lines that Nostradamus predicted, but it doesn’t have to. We can change it. Before we move on from this period of the 1600s, we need to record the beginnings of the most important vehicle of Brotherhood control and manipulation. It was to give this amalgamation of secret, covert, groupings the power to advance its desire for global domination like never before. We call it the world money system. Throughout human history, the purchase of goods and services had been through barter, one thing exchanged directly for another, or by coins which were made from metals which reflected the value of the coin. This made metals like gold and silver more valuable than others, because they could be used to make coins and thereby could be exchanged for whatever you liked. But then a series of events began to happen. People didn’t want to have all that gold and silver lying around waiting to be stolen, so it became the custom to deposit these metals with those who had strong rooms where it would be safe. Many of t½ese strong rooms were owned by goldsmiths. The goldsmith would give receipts to the customer for the value of the deposit and when these were returned they would hand back that amount of precious metals. The customers began to use these receipts as forms of exchange because they were more convenient than moving the metals around and the goldsmiths, and other strong room owners realised that only a small number of these receipts were returned to them at any one time by people coming to collect their metals deposits. So why could they not issue receipts to people who didn’t actually own any of the metals and then charge them interest for the privilege? What a great idea. You could lend money on metal owned by someone else and charge a fee for doing it! The receipt (money) was worthless if all the owners of your"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"119 metal deposits wanted them returned at the same time, but as this never happened you were laughing, unless you issued far too many notes. From this has come today’s banking system which is controlled by the Brotherhood to further its ends. Banks are allowed literally to invent money well in excess of their actual assets and charge interest on that money. The governments and people of the world are now submerged under debt to the banks of staggering proportions, and that debt is money conjured out of nothing by the banking system. Type in a few figures on a computer screen, move that number to a person’s account on another part of the computer programme, and from that moment you can start charging that person interest on money that isn’t yours, and doesn’t physically exist. More than that, if a person falls behind in the interest payments on money you don’t own and doesn’t exist, you can take their home and possessions that do exist, and even have them sent to prison. By this simple means you can put governments and people into so much manufactured debt that they become pawns which you can move around the board at will. You can force people to do what they have no wish to do because they have to earn the money to pay you back the money you did not own in the first place, and it is the same with governments. It is utterly insane for banks under no government control to be given this power to create money out of nothing, but the Brotherhood societies, at the highest level in this case, brought this into being and manipulate entire nations and continents with it day after day. It has also allowed more wars to be fought and prolonged, because instead of being limited to the assets a country owned, the bankers could now issue pieces of paper to keep the conflict going. Then, after the war, the governments were even further in debt and their people would have to suffer more hardships if their country was going to pay back the banks for the money that did not exist. Now wars not only became wonderful tools of control for the Brotherhood, they were fantastic ways to increase their wealth. They couldn’t lose. They would lend invented money to both sides, charge them interest on it, and then lend them more invented money to rebuild the countries that had been devastated by those wars. And we, men and women of the world, continue to put up with it! The first major bank of this kind was the Bank of Amsterdam set up in the early 1600s and it immediately began to lend to the Dutch government to finance"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"120 more wars. The Bank of England followed in 1694 and became the model for all the others. These centuries we have discussed were of enormous significance, with the Renaissance opening the minds of Europeans to the knowledge of Greece, the Reformation breaking the power of the Pope, and the introduction of the banking system. Within the mass of the people, dissatisfaction was stirring at the way they were treated and the foundations for rebellion and eventually parliamentary democracy were in place. It would still take many centuries to arrive and the Church would battle to prevent it, but the cracks had appeared in their wall of suppression and the flood was sure to follow."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"121 8 Eagle Tails An area of substantial volunteer activity over the thousands of years after the demise of Atlantis have been the lands we call the Americas. North, South, and Central America were populated by groups of nomadic and agricultural peoples long before the Sumerians were settling in Mesopotamia. You would think, if you didn’t know, that American history began with the coming of the European invaders, but that happened only a few hundred years ago. The Americas evolved with the thousands of tribes which developed with their diverse cultures and beliefs. As in the rest of world, some would grow and conquer others to create empires. One of these was the Aztecs in what we call Mexico. They were advanced in that they built fantastic pyramids and cities, as did many peoples of the Americas, but at the same time they slaughtered untold thousands in sacrifices to their gods at the whim of the priests. You can see how civilisations across the world were being affected by some global consciousness or the same extra-terrestrial races that encouraged them to believe the same myths. There are many similarities between the Sumerian and Egyptian cultures and what has been found of ancient American history. The all-seeing eye is there; so are the pyramids, some with great similarities to those in Egypt. Stories can be found of the gods who created human beings and tried to make them their slaves. The themes of Atlantis, Sumer, Babylon and Egypt apply equally to the Americas. One of the intriguing and interesting peoples of the Americas were the Maya. It is believed that they evolved from another people called the Olmecs, and both built amazing pyramids. The connections between the beliefs of the Maya and the Egyptians are obvious. The Maya pyramids were faced with limestone as was the Great Pyramid at Giza, and the beliefs in mummifying bodies and the nature of life"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"122 after death were similar. I think there is an excellent chance that the same ET races were responsible for developing both civilisations in their early days. But the Mayan civilisation lasted for thousands of years and we should not fall into the trap of thinking it was always the same. Some Mayans apparently practised human sacrifice, but this was not general. These things change. What is termed the Classic Mayan period is reckoned to have been from about 435 to 830AD, when their culture seems to have stopped quite abruptly. The Maya settled on the land now known as Guatemala and north to Yucatan and in that classic period they devised a measurement of time very different to our own today. It related to natural energy cycles and they devised a mathematical system of numbers and symbols to work out the cycles and translate them into a form of language. The Maya, some of whom were from highly evolved Volunteer consciousness, left records of their calendar and mathematical system. They believed that the Earth began a new cycle of evolution in 31 13Bc and that this would be completed in 2012. This would link in very well with what I am saying about the Photon Beam and the many prophecies through the ages of great change at this time. Numbers and symbols can be found on the ruins and artifacts of many ancient civilisations. As we are now beginning to understand again, everything is an energy, numbers and symbols included. Numbers and symbols represent certain energy vibrations and the Mayan system was a mathematical code for energies and their cycles. It’s funny how we have this idea that evolution and understanding can only progress and cannot go backwards. This belief insists that peoples a decade ago let alone 1,500 years ago could not possibly know more about Creation than we do. This is a fallacy. The knowledge exists outside of this dense physical planet and always has. It has been a case of getting that knowledge through the imbalances and the dense vibration of the Earth to our conscious levels. This could have happened in Central America in 435 far easier than in the years of religious imposition in Europe and the Middle East when minds were slamming shut in their hundreds of thousands through fear and the thought-police. One other point to remember is that while the ancient Maya may be gone, their energy has not. When we think we create energy fields and so in that former land of the Maya, as with Egypt and elsewhere, the knowledge they worked with is still there waiting to be accessed."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"123 Going to these places and quietly tuning into the energy fields can open up your understanding quicker than reading a thousand history books. If you tap into this ancient knowledge held in thought energy fields you can learn so much about them. It doesn’t come on sheets of paper, it is a knowing-ness, an inspired understanding that you cannot always describe. In South America, volunteers incarnated to work in the area around Lake Titicaca which spans today’s Peru - Bolivia border. These groups would later move north and evolve into the Inca civilisation centred around Cusco in the Andes. The Incas worshipped the Sun god, and again this could have been based on an understanding of the consciousness of the Sun as a purveyor of universal knowledge and wisdom. At their peak the Incas controlled an area of 2,000 miles by 200, and they became motivated by power, wealth, and expansion as the original understanding was lost. The choice of location for these volunteer incarnations was linked to the points on the energy grid which needed to be worked on. The region that includes Lake Titicaca, Sun Island, Cusco, Machu Picchu, and the Sacred Valley of the Incas, is one of the most powerful on the planet. I am not suggesting for a second that the incarnations of the volunteer consciousness were always shining reflections of virtue. They were men and women of their time and they were affected by the culture they were born into. They still are. What they had was a more powerful link with their higher consciousness and this had two positive effects. Firstly information and inspiration could be brought down to this level. This showed itself in those who challenged the bigotry of religion and authority and advanced human understanding through philosophy and scientific discovery. Secondly, they were open channels to ground powerful energies and pass them into the grid. Some significant volunteer incarnations were in North America among the tribes of what have become known as ‘Red Indians’. The ‘Indians’ (Native Americans) understood the basics of the energy system and their medicine wheels were circles of stones where ceremonies took place at points on the energy grid. Obviously, they would not have understood exactly what they were doing within the confines of the physical form, but the connection with the higher self was strong enough for them to do what was necessary on the physical level. They passed on their understanding in legends and stories which contained many truths portrayed symbolically and many"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"124 myths, too, I’m sure. More than anything they had a respect for the Earth and the rest of Creation, which led them to take from nature only what they believed they needed. Every civilisation has its ‘classic’ periods as with the Maya when the volunteer consciousness was there in numbers for a specific time and task, and so it was with the Native American tribes through the centuries. The culture was not all-peaceful and all-knowing, nor should we have expected it to be. There is, I feel, a naive belief that those who come from higher levels to help the Earth cannot be genuine unless they behave ‘perfectly’. The myths ofjesus have sprung from this idea. It doesn’t matter how evolved your higher self, the incarnating lower self is still subject to the imbalances, the dense vibration, and the culture it is incarnating into. The Indian tribes fought each other as inherited distrust and hatred spanned the generations and being a brave warrior was the way male status was often measured. It was usually the elders who had seen the consequences of this through their lives who argued against such conflict. Part of a famous speech by Chief Seattle of the Dwamish Indians highlighted this. As a young man he was renowned as a courageous warrior and leader. But in his late fifties or early sixties when the white settlers had taken over the United States he is reported to have said: “When our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong and disfigure their faces with black paint, their hearts, also, are disfigured and turn black. Then their cruelty is relentless and knows no bounds. Our old men are not able to restrain them... True it is, that revenge is considered gain, even at the cost of their own lives, but old men who stay at home in times of war, and old women who have sons to lose, know better.” This is an important point. We should not feel guilty about what we have done or believed in the past. When we are born into a culture of whatever kind it may be, we become subject to its conditioning. When our consciousness looks out through the eyes of the physical form as a child it is bound to be affected fundamentally by what it sees and is told. If the young braves werejudged by their courage as warriors and their fighting abilities, most children would take on those same values. A child does not come out of the womb and say I want to be a vegetarian. He or she will eat meat if that is what the family puts on the plate. No matter how evolved the consciousness, it"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"125 takes time to break through the illusions, indoctrinations, and inherited ‘values’ of this physical world. But there comes a point when you have seen enough for the excuse of indoctrination to be no longer valid. That is when we face the choice of following our instincts or taking the apparently easy route of least resistance and continue to follow the indoctrination. Age and experience can, as with Chief Seattle, bring wisdom and understanding. But as we also see in millions of others the years can increase the power of that indoctrination. Witness the attitudes of many older people today for evidence of that. I would not wish to give the impression that these incarnations of the volunteers all produced people with piercing blue eyes who blessed their enemies, healed the sick and disappeared on a cloud into heaven at the end of it. They have had to live with the pressures of this world and some have gone through an entire physical life without their higher knowledge manifesting. There are many like that today, unfortunately. All I am saying is that, overall, these volunteers have done a tremendous amount to keep the Earth and the spiritual understandings alive until this time of transformation. So we are looking at the Americas before the European invasion peopled by tribes and empires of great diversity of culture and outlook. Some were highly evolved in their understanding, some still primitive, some a bit of both. Some were at war with each other, some at peace. None would have known of a saviour god called Jesus Christ or even that Christianity and the people of the Middle East and Europe even existed, but they were now to find out in an orgy of genocide as the will of the representatives of the Christian god arrived on their shores. Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa in 1436. The Christian doctrine believed that the Earth was flat, but Columbus studied the writings of Ptolemy of Alexandria who made astronomical studies in the second century, and this made him doubt the Christian belief. Columbus came to the conclusion that the Earth was a sphere. The travels of Marco Polo and others had revealed the existence of the East and Columbus believed that if he sailed West he would sail around the world to reach India and Asia. He planned his epic journey, but could find no enthusiasm or financial support from his own people. The Kings of Portugal and Spain also turned him down, and in Spain the Church told him his ideas were impossible because they were contrary to Scripture. Henry VII of England also said no."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"126 In the end a group of Spanish merchants supported him and he set out in the Santa Maria, flanked by two other ships, in 1492. For months they sailed until they struck land in what is now the Bahamas. He discovered other islands, including Cuba, but to the end of his life Columbus believed he had landed in India. Hence we have the name ‘West Indies’ and ‘Indians’ to this day. He returned to Spain with gold, cotton, and other ‘finds’ including two natives who were to be baptised into the Christian faith. This changed the attitude of the King of Spain and when Columbus sailed again for ‘India’ the following year he took with him 1,500 men in seventeen ships. The Pope had given him permission to take possession of all the lands he found in the name of the King of Spain who had already agreed to share the booty with his Holiness. Columbus became governor of the lands he found. Not only did he take them from the native population, he introduced slavery and treated the people with the sort of Christian goodwill that is so widely documented in this book. Columbus was a devout Christian, always saying prayers, and his brutality against the natives had the full support of the priests who had travelled with him. Christianity which had spread its darkness across the ‘old’ world had now reached the Americas. Western Europe was desperate for a share of the spoils which Columbus had identified and others were soon to follow his path across the Atlantic. Vasco Da Gama, a Portuguese, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and on to the real India. A Spaniard, Vicente Pinzon, who sailed on that first journey with Columbus, led his own expedition and found Brazil closely followed by the Portuguese. In 1519, Magellan, another native of Portugal, led an attempt to sail around the World. He died on the journey, but others completed the circumnavigation, so proving that the planet was indeed a sphere. These journeys and others increased the knowledge of geography and horizons were widened in all directions. Over the next four centuries the powerful countries of Europe would battle for the ownership of distant lands throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas. It was the greatest act of piracy and robbery the world has ever seen. The British, Dutch, French, Belgians, Spanish, Portuguese, and others plundered the planet imposing their culture and religion on the native peoples, mostly killing or banishing into slavery all who resisted. Australia and New Zealand were found and ‘Christianised’."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"127 The name Cortez will always be remembered by the peoples of Central America. He was a Christian zealot who landed there in 1519 at the time of the local king called Montezuma. Cortez was treated well by the native peoples who thought he was the long awaited return of their god, Quetzalcohatl which translates as ‘Our beloved son’. The beliefs surrounding him are yet more compelling evidence of a common source connecting the Middle East and the Americas. He was said to have been born to a virgin, Chimalman, who was told by a heavenly messenger that she would conceive a son without sexual intercourse. Quetzalcohatl was also said to have been tempted by the devil, to have fasted for forty days and to have been crucified. But Montezuma’s people were soon to realise that Cortez was no second coming of this god. Once he saw the wealth and magnificence of the culture, he set about killing thousands to force upon them Spanish rule and Christianity. Among their conquests were the lands of the Maya which had continued to be populated by those who came after the Classic Mayan period. Accept gentle Jesus as your saviour or we slaughter you was the basic message of the invading Europeans. One Spanish historian of the time estimated that twelve million natives of South America alone were killed after the Europeans landed and an even greater number became slaves. It was claimed with pride that Great Britain owned so many countries that the Sun never set on the British Empire. This glorious empire was, like all of its kind, a means to exploit and dominate for reasons of riches, resources, and trade. I would not suggest that everything the Europeans did in these countries was negative and without merit, but the motivation and imposition behind these conquests was appalling. The consequences of this occupation are still being unravelled. There was no need for all this murder and suffering for these different cultures to interact. It could have been done for mutual benefit. But the Luciferic Consciousness had implanted the belief in enough people that whatever you wanted you took by force and you imposed your will and religion. Your god was always on your side and whatever you did you did for him. As long as you had been baptised and believed in St Paul’s saviour-god called Jesus Christ you were guaranteed a place in heaven no matter what you did. Indeed it is even in the Articles of Faith of the Church of England to this day that good deeds are not the way to salvation.

As one of the Psalms says: “I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” We are highlighting in this chapter the development of the Amer icas and particularly North America which was to become in the form of the United States the most powerful nation on the planet. The Spanish and Portuguese plundered most of South America, where they destroyed the native culture and beliefs and introduced Christianity in the form of Roman Catholicism, that dark creed which still enslaves the minds of millions on that continent through fear and guilt. North America became largely the property of the English and French although Pope Alexander VI had ‘given’ the whole of the Americas to Spain and Portugal, especially Spain (He was a Spaniard). Four years after Columbus discovered the West Indies, two Venetians based in Bristol, England, sailed with the backing of Henry VII for North America. They were John and Sebastian Cabot, father and son, and they followed the route taken by earlier explorers like the Vikings who had landed in the New York area five hundred years before. They called it Vinland. The Cabots discovered the North American coast, but little was done about their find for many years and by then the Frenchman, Jacques Cartier, had laid claim for his country to the region of what is now Eastern Canada. He was followed by another Frenchmen, Samuel de Champlain, who founded Canada and built a fort which he called Quebec. His ambition was to convert the native tribes to Roman Catholicism and expand the fur trade, which involved the native peoples giving him furs in exchange for guns and booze. His intervention started wars between the tribes and caused great disruption. But he did not convert them to Christianity, not least because the Catholics and Protestants in his midst spend most of their time fighting each other. Other Christian missionaries who tried to force their religion upon the Indians were killed by the very guns that had been traded for the furs.

He also ordered a gruesome purge against ‘witches’ (mediums) and his treatment of Roman Catholics was so terrible, two of their number, Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, organised the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 to assassinate him. It was James I who took part of Northern Ireland from the Catholics and encouraged it to be settled by England and Scottish Protestants. This set in motion the centuries of hatred and conflict between the two Christian fractions that created a sort of religious apartheid that still continues. Britain under James I was not a good place to be unless you were an Anglican, and the exodus to America grew. Many Puritans settled in a place they called New England where they matched the violence and intolerance shown to them in Europe with their own treatment of the Indians and others who did not share their misguided Faith. In Virginia, tobacco was the currency and people were fined SOlbs of tobacco for not attending church, 2000lbs for not having their child baptised, and 5,000lbs for entertaining a Quaker. Death is no cure for ignorance and neither is a journey across the Atlantic. This led William Penn, a compassionate Quaker, to found Pennsylvania in 1682, on land given to him by Charles II in exchange for the money lent to him by Penn’s father. He opened his lands to Quakers and all persecuted Nonconformists, and he made friends with the Indians. He showed how they could live together to their mutual benefit. The Indians also gave a piece of land to Roger Williams who founded the State of Rhode Island as a haven of peace and religious tolerance. Mostly, however, the North American settlers treated the Indians and people of differing beliefs as heathen with no dignity or rights under God. By the 18th century the French had been driven out of North America by the British who treated these lands as an extension of the British Isles. But the settlers were beginning to resent this. They still paid allegiance to the British King, but they rebelled when they were told to pay taxes to the British Government without their consent. Troops were dispatched to force the settlers into submission and the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"130 American War of Independence began. Brotherhood-style secret societies with the familiar initiations and methods were already at work in the Americas before the European invasion, but after that their numbers simply exploded and they were extremely involved in the events before the American War of Independence. Freemasonry abounded and George Washington was a freemason, initiated into the Craft at the age of twenty in 1752. As an officer in the colonial army, he is believed by some historians to have ordered the killing of French troops in the Ohio Valley when there was no military justification, let alone a moral one. This created more conflict between the British and French which flared in Europe as the bitter and bloody Seven Years War. This claimed around a million military and civilian casualties and left both countries with enormous debts to the money inventors, the banking elite controlled by the Brotherhood. There was also the cost of keeping an army in America. All this led the British to levy higher taxation on her people, and duties on goods in the American colonies, to service the debt, and hence you had the disputes that fuelled the War of Independence. The resistance in the colonies was so fierce that the British withdrew the new duties, except for those on tea. The colonists were by now whipped up by the Freemason lodges masquerading as revolutionary groups. Members of the St Andrews Lodge in Boston dressed up as Indians and threw tea into the harbour in protest at the duty and no matter what the British had done, it was too late. The Brotherhood wanted independence for America for longer term motives and that was the way it was going to be. It is pretty clear that the Freemasons had been working to stir up revolution against the British for at least ten years before the war began. It was fought over six years until the Americans won and the British were sent packing. George Washington was Commander in Chief of the American troops and he was to become the first President of the newly formed United States of America. He was a freemason as I have pointed out and so were most, perhaps all, of the key revolutionaries, many of them were Grand Masters. Masons like Washington and Franklin had the symbol of the All Seeing Eye sewn onto their sheepskin Masonic aprons. This was without question a Brotherhood revolution. Independence was declared in 1776, although the war went on for some years after that, until the decisive Battle of Yorktown in 1781 settled the issue of who would rule the country. The Americans were supported with arms and resources by"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"131 the French after one of the revolutionaries, the freemason, Benjamin Franklin, persuaded them to help. The French were looking for some revenge for their defeats by the British and even if they were not the Brotherhood network in France would have made sure help was forthcoming. Franklin secured the services in France of the German freemason Baron von Steuben who had served in the army of Frederick the Great of Prussia and he was to play a major part in turning the American army into a fighting force. With victory secured the Declaration of Independence severed ties with Britain. The symbols of the new nation reflected those of the Brotherhood and its branches which had brought it into being. In 1782 a man called William Barton produced a design for the Seal of the new United States and it included the classic symbols from the Brotherhood in ancient Egypt - the pyramid topped by an allseeing eye. Below that were the words Novus Ordo Seclorum which mean ‘The beginning of a new order of the ages’. This refers to the Brotherhood’s ‘Great work of ages’ and it is expressed today as The New World Order. This part of Barton’s design is included in the United States Great Seal today, and on the dollar bill. The phoenix, another Egyptian Brotherhood symbol was also on the original seal before it was later replaced by the Eagle. American Freemasonry broke away from its ‘Mother Lodge’ in England after independence and it adopted the English York Rite of Freemasonry with its ten degrees of initiation and most significantly, the Scottish Rite, with its thirty-three degrees. The Scottish rite in particular has had a fundamental influence on American politics, economics, and foreign policy from that time on. The Brotherhood controls the American banks and the Federal Reserve, their version of the bank of England, which creates money out of nothing and plays the tune to which the elected politicians have to dance. That is not to say that all the revolutionaries were involved in skullduggery and wished to bring about this abuse of freedom or that the desire for revolution was wrong. Why should one country own another in that way? Most if not all the revolutionaries would have believed they were doing the right thing for the right reasons, but who was controlling their thinking from the perspective of another agenda? It is not always the event itself that is wrong, but the hidden agenda behind it. One man who played an important part in the fight for American independence could rightly be included among the great men of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"132 human history. If ever there was an example of the volunteer consciousness incarnate, it is he. Thomas Paine was born the son of a Norfolk Quaker in 1736. His outspoken support of the oppressed in England and his opposition to religion made him highly unpopular with the authorities and he went to America to support the people in their dispute with the British Parliament and King George III. He fought on the American side and published a pamphlet called ‘Common Sense’ which called for complete independence for the colonies and not some diluted compromise that would still leave them under British rule. Another pamphlet, ‘The Crisis’, motivated the people to go on when the situation looked bleak. His words were widely read and they are credited with having a significant impact on the course of the War. He was a renowned figure when independence was won, but instead of enjoying the glory he returned home to England hoping to do the same there. He wrote The Rights of Man in 1791 which exposed the corruption and nonsense of Church, monarch, and state, while setting out an alternative society based on democracy, educ4ion and equal rights for all. This was the time after the French Revolution when the British gentry were terrified of a people’s rebellion. A writ was issued for his arrest, but his work circulated rapidly among the poor who at last had someone speaking for them. Anyone found publishing or possessing The Rights of Man was jailed or banished and effigies of Paine with a rope around his neck were carried through the streets by those whose power he threatened. He was a man ahead of his time, but such men are vital to light the fuse which later explodes into fundamental change. Paine escaped to France where he was elected to the new French Assembly. He was appointed to the committee putting together a new French Constitution and he argued that there should be no bloodshed or reprisals against the monarchy and aristocracy. He wanted to destroy the institutions of repression, not kill the people in them. When he voted against the killing of King Louis XVI he was arrested and sentenced to death. Here we are again with one tyranny and rule by fear replacing another. George Washington was asked for help, but refused and it took the efforts of others to win his release a year later. During his captivity he wrote his book, The Age of Reason, which dismantled the preposterous claims of Christianity which he said were not the work of God, but of stupid men. His book said of the Bible:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"133 “Whenever I read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the relentless vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent if we call it the word of demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalise Mankind. And for my part, I detest it as I detest everything that is cruel.” Thomas Paine was a great, great, man. ‘The world is my country and to do good is my religion’, he once said, and the only trinity he had any time for was Truth, Liberty, and Justice. There have been few more decent, loving, brave, and wise people on this planet. Yet history has largely forgotten him because no juvenile religion was set up in his name. In Christendom you could call for political liberty if it suited the people, but not for religious liberty. When Paine returned to America after the publication of the book he was shunned by those he had helped to free. In some areas it was even dangerous for him to walk down the street. But then he was used to religious opposition in America, because in earlier times they had opposed his opposition to slavery. The United States was built on the backs of black slaves from Africa. Slavery had been part of human life through most of history and some of the Popes were the biggest slave owners of their day. The idea of the chosen ones having God’s permission to own the heathens was a constant justification. In the Bible we read: “Both thy bondsmen and thy bondsmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondsmen and bondsmaids. Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy; and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land; and they shall be your possession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondsmen forever.” That is from Leviticus, and these are the words of St Paul: “Slaves obey your Earthly masters with respect and fear. And with sincerity of heart as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only to win their fovour when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.”"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"134 The Christian creed had no problem with slavery. It was God’s will. Hundreds of thousands of native Africans were captured by the slave ships of Britain, America, and elsewhere and taken to the New World to be sold to the highest bidder. The hymn writer, John Newton, was the master on a slave ship and from his pen came How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believer’s ear. Opponents to this stunning inhumanity called slavery were hung, shot, and burned alive by the slave owning mobs and sermons were made in support of both slavery and the violence against protesters. It was a major offence to teach a slave to read, and there were discussions on whether it was best to work a slave to death or use them more sparingly so they would last longer. (The same debate went on in relation to the Jews in Nazi Germany). The law allowed slaves to be flogged to death and shot if they refused to accept the flogging. Their tongues and eyes were cut out on many occasions and they were branded if they tried to escape. The British were at the heart of this trade and many British companies grew wealthy on it. The British built forts off the African Coast to protect the slave traffic and they gave grants of free land in the West Indies on condition that at least four negro slaves were kept for every hundred acres. Slavery became an issue which divided the United States very roughly between North and South. Most Freemason lodges supported it, but many did not. By far the greatest number of slaves were concentrated in the Southern States where they worked in the cotton fields. Some brave people helped a few escape to Canada at great risk to themselves and among them was John Brown, an Ohio wool dealer, who was caught and executed. He became a martyr remembered by the famous song in which ‘his soul goes marching on’. William Lloyd Garrison published The Liberator which highlighted the treatment of the slaves and was sent to prison for his opinions, but it roused yet more to the cause. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote her book, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, published in 1852, telling the stories she had heard from the slaves who had escaped. The Pope ordered the book to be banned and the clergy condemned its publication. In the 1860 presidential election, Abraham Lincoln, an abolition ist, was elected. The South declared independence under its own president, Jefferson Davis, and they increased the powers of slave owners. The United States were now anything but united. They were two nations, one overwhelmingly for slavery and one against. Lincoln, whose desire for the end of slavery was not as fierce as"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"135 some, offered to allow it to continue if the South would return, but they didn’t trust him. The Civil War ensued, but contrary to what is widely believed it was not about the plight of slaves, but the unity of the country. It was like most conflicts, justified by a contradiction. Lincoln and his supporters went to war to preserve the union under the banner of freedom. But while the behaviour of the Southern States was appalling to the slaves, they had every right under the Constitution to withdraw from the union. Lincoln and the North fought to deny them that right. The emancipation of slaves was a by- product of the war, not the motivation behind it. Slavery continued in the North until the war was over, and legislation to free Southern slaves during the war was enacted only because it was claimed that the Southerners were no longer United States citizens, and therefore had lost their rights to own slaves as those in the North continued to do. The war was about the withdrawal from the Union by the Southern States, caused by disagreements over slavery. It was not about slavery as such. The South, the ‘rebels’ or ‘Confederates’ held the initiative in the first phases of the war, but after losing the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 the North, the ‘Federalists’, turned the tide and went on to victory. By then half a million people had died at a cost of nearly two billion pounds to the US economy and the belief that a state could decide at will to withdraw from the Union as agreed by the Founding Fathers was crushed. The United States was now a nation, as were Germany and Italy in the wake of their civil wars which happened in this same period. The USA would produce great inventors and many skilled in trade and business as they exploited and directed the Industrial Revolution to become the world’s most powerful country. The tragic victims of the expansion across the North American continent in both the United States and Canada were the native tribes. They were pushed into the interior by the settlers who advanced Westwards until there was nowhere left for the Indians to go. When they lost the many battles to retain their homelands they were forced onto reservations which were, themselves, gradually reduced by the economic ‘needs’ of the government. White men did indeed speak with forked tongue when they made their promises to the Indians which were never kept. The story of the genocide of the native Americans by the settlers from Europe is one of the most atrocious episodes in the long and sorry tale of man’s inhumanity to man. The"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"136 reality of these events is only now beginning to be told in films like ‘Dances With Wolves’ and the truth is breaking through the Hollywood and government propaganda of most of this century which portrayed the Indians as savages and the God-fearing settlers as the agents of freedom and civilisation. In Australia and the other countries where the invading Christians occupied native lands by force and brutality the truth of these times is being more widely understood. In my travels to Canada and the United States I have had the overwhelming feeling that I have had many past lives as an Indian. When I was in Calgary, Canada, I saw a picture of a chief and I felt a strong and instinctive bond with him. His name was ‘Sitting on an Eagle Tail’, chief of the North Peigans, one of a group of tribes that went under the overall name of Blackfoot. Just to complicate matters there was also an individual tribe in the group also called the Blackfoot. I travelled through an area known as the Porcupine Hills, south of Calgary near the Old Man River and I have rarely been moved by a place anywhere in the world. My spirit just sang with joy. I would later discover that Eagle Tail was one of those who signed the land treaty with the white settlers which put the Indian tribes onto reservations and he had chosen an area around the Porcupine Hills and the Old Man River. He loved the area and felt it was the best place for his people to settle. I talk more of these experiences in Truth Vibrations and In The Light Of Experience. Two years after that trip to Canada, I was walking through Oxford with Yeva looking for the Pitt Rivers Museum which has a section dedicated to Indian history. We were given the wrong directions to the Museum and we were lost. As we walked I told her about Sitting on an Eagle Tail and how I felt that was a previous incarnation. At that moment we passed a pub called ‘The Eagle and the Child’. I looked up at the pub sign hanging from the wall. There before me was a picture of an eagle with a little child sitting on its tail! I have had scores of ‘coincidences’ happen to me since my awakening became conscious in 1990, but that was a real stunner. I began to read widely of the Indian period in North America and, as with my visits to former Indian lands, I have felt a deep and painful sadness at the way that culture and understanding was swept away in such a short time. When I visited former Indian lands around Sedona in Arizona, Monument Valley in Utah, and a their beauty and"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"137 the memories of my Indian lives. But underlying that has always been sadness at what happened. I read a book about the life of the Blackfoot Chief, Crowfoot, which also spanned the lifetime of Eagle Tail. It was sobering to see that when they were born the Indian way of life had remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years; by the time they died in the latter part of the last century, their tribes were dependent on hand-outs from the white settlers. Their lands had been taken and their independence was gone. These proud people were lining up on their little reservations to be given their rations. The Christian missionaries had arrived seeking to impose their creed upon the Indian people. The ‘God-fearers’ were rampant and some of the most tragic and pathetic pictures I have seen are of Indian people, Bibles in hand and assembled in their Sunday best, waiting to be indoctrinated and mind-controlled in the mission churches built on their reservations. Nearly fifteen hundred years after the nonsense of Nicaea, it was now spreading its arrogance and mind control across North America which, until then, had somehow managed to survive very nicely without it. It was only in 1877 that Crowfoot and Eagle Tail had, with others, signed the land treaty that confined them to reservations which the settlers would go on diminishing whenever they could. By then their tribes had been ravaged by war and diseases like smallpox which the settlers had brought with them. Every picture I have seen of Eagle Tail portrays a near-broken spirit and given what happened in his lifetime that is easy to understand. They had been the victims of the industrialisation of the world that had begun in Britain and spread like a cancer across Europe. The influx of settlers from Europe who emigrated in increasing numbers to the ‘New World’ took with them that same religious intolerance and economic ethos or imported it once they were there. The Luciferic consciousness was now unleashing everything it could muster before the time of the Great Cleansing which was fast approaching. Much of the human race was easy prey, and it was rapidly discovering the means to destroy itself and the planet, too."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"138 9 The Rule of Science The Brotherhood had grown enormously in numbers and power over the six thousand years since Sumer and Egypt and it was now to enter a new phase in its desire for world domination. It inspired scores of ‘people’s revolutions’ and civil wars to replace the monarchies and it achieved this in the normal way - by working through both sides to create the conflict and the atmosphere of unrest. Sometimes the monarch would hold on, more often the revolution would usher in a people’s dictatorship or ‘democratic government’. The Brotherhood could work more covertly behind the smokescreen of democracy, but it wished to ensure that enough ‘bogeymen’ existed around the world to unite people in mutual fear. People in fear are so much easier to control, as we shall see. It also had a longer term aim to replace traditional religion with the Godless version of science called materialism. This was the final stage of the Brotherhood plan to pursuade people they werejust physical, one-life, accidents, with no spirit or eternal purpose. The more that people can be encouraged to think that way the more they become locked in materialism and lose touch with who they are. In that state of mind they are perfectly placed to become the robots of the Brotherhood by closing down their connections with higher levels of themselves and Creation. In the 1 800s some_documents surfaced called the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion. Almost everything these documents proposed to do has happened in this century. Perhaps, in parL, they were made public for purposes of disinformation, not least in using a title that blames it all on the Jews. The Brotherhood manipulation of the world is not a purely Jewish phenomenon. Yes there are Jews involved, but so are others of many other races, and people of all political persuasions, from capitalist to communist to anarchist. All play their part in the covert game plan and the Jews in general have suffered tremendously at times from the manipulation of the Brotherhood. The Protocols do, however, give"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"139 such an excellent indication of the Brotherhood’s intentions that I will use passages from them through the book. I only came across them after the rest of the book was completed. To overcome the misleading reference to Zion, I will refer to them as the Illuminati Protocols and from this point I will also use the name Illuminati to describe the Brotherhood elite who are aware of the real agenda. The Protocols make clear the Illuminati’s view of the masses. Its contempt of the general population, the Goyim as it calls us, knows no bounds. It sees us as mere cattle and a mob and, while its analysis is distasteful, it cannot, unfortunately, be accused of inaccuracy in its contention of how easily most people allow themselves to be manipulated. The Protocols acknowledge the Brother hood’s role in the overthrow of the monarchies: “On the ruins of the natural and genealogical aristocracy of the Goyim we have set up the aristocracy of our educated class, headed by the aristocracy of money. The qualifications for this aristocracy we have established in wealth, which is dependent on us ....“ (Protocol 1). “Remember the French Revolution, to which it was we who gave the name of ‘Great’: the secrets of its preparations are well known to us, for it was all the work of our hands. Ever since that time we have been leading the people from one disenchantment to another.” (Protocol 3). The great majority of people who campaigned for the end of the monarchies and against the imposition of religion, have done so with the finest of intentions, and it was exactly what needed to happen. The Brotherhood was often pushing against an open door with that part of its plan, because people were getting fed up with Church and monarchs. But while most campaigners wanted to replace both with true freedom for the human mind and true democracy, the Brotherhood Illuminati elite had other ideas. It used popular sentiment to overthrow monarchs and reduce the credibility of the Church, but then used its power to replace them with an illusion of democracy and a science which denied that people have any other dimension, apart from the physical body. “The abstraction of freedom has enabled us to persuade the mob in all countries that their government is nothing but the steward of the people who are the owners of the country and that the steward may be replaced like a worn out glove. It is this possibility of replacing the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"140 representatives of the people which has placed them at our disposal and, as it were, given us the power of appointment. . . . The (politicians) whom we shall choose from among the public, with strict regard to their capabilities for servile obedience, will not be persons trained in the arts of government and will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the hands of learning and genius who will be their advisors, specialists bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world.” (Protocol 2). “In order that our scheme may produce this result we shall arrange elections in fovour of such presidents as have in their past some dark, undiscovered stain, some “Panama” or other - then they will be trustworthy agents for the accomplishment of our plans out of fear of revelations and from the natural desire of everyone who has attained power, namely, the retention of priviledges, advantages, and honour connected with the office of President.” (Protocol 10). Freemasonry was to undergo a significant change after the English Civil War and into early the 1700s. The Craft was opened up to more and more people who were not masons or craftsmen by profession and soon they would be by far the majority. In 1717 a new Grand Lodge was launched at a meeting in London and some were to call this the Mother Grand Lodge of the World. This was the lodge the American freemasons were connected with before the War of Independence. The old links with the profession of masonry became purely symbolic with titles like Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, no longer relating in any way to the masons work, but only to the levels of initiation within the new Freemasonry, the so called three Blue Degrees. The Mother Grand Lodge quickly expanded its influence across Europe and the British Empire, issuing permission for other branches to practice the Blue Degree System. In Scotland, Michael Ramsey would establish another branch of Freemasonry based on the old Knights Templar system, and what became known as the Scottish Degrees or Rites of Freemasonry would go on to become the dominant form of the Craft. Today it is the Scottish Rites, with the thirty-three degrees of initiation, which is behind the Freemasonic mafia that controls the United States and many other countries from behind the scenes today. “We shall create and multiply freemasonic lodges in all countries of the world, absorb into them all who may become or who are"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"141 prominent in public activity, for in these lodges we shall find our principle intelligence office and means of influence. All these lodges we shall bring under one central administration, known to us alone and to all others absolutely unknown, which will be composed of our learned elders (Illuminati) . . In these lodges we shall tie together the knot which binds together all revolutionary and liberal movements. Their composition will be made up of all strata of society. The most secret political plot will be known to us and will fall under our guiding hands on the very day of their conception.” (Protocol 15). The English civil war brought a temporary end to the monarchy and even in the longer term, dramatically reduced its power. The Royalists (Anglicans) were defeated by the Roundheads (Nonconformists) and Charles I was executed in 1649. The first attempt at government by the people was in fact government by Oliver Cromwell, a morose Puritan squire, who ruled as Lord Protector with the support of his army. He banned Anglican services and continued penal laws against the Catholics. Cromwell purged non-believers in his view of Christianity and continued the dreadful treatment of the Irish, while also abolishing amusements, the arts, fun, laughter, and affection. This is how the Puritans interpreted the Bible. Laughter and happiness were a sin. They remind me of those signs you see sometimes in comic stories which say: No dancing, no singing, no laughing, no nuffin’. They accepted and expanded upon the beliefs of Calvinism, and they promoted the extraordinary claims that war and conflict were signs of spiritual salvation, because it was evidence of the struggle to remove Satan from the Earth. Peace meant that Satan was not being challenged! Such thinking governed Britain at this time and would, as we have seen, also be exported to America with the Puritan ‘pilgrims’. After Cromwell died in 1658, parliament invited the exiled brother of Charles I to take the throne as Charles II on the understanding that there would be religious tolerance. He agreed, but then began a reign of persecution against the Puritans and those who didn’t worship the Anglican Faith. Tens of thousands of Nonconformists were killed, tortured, or shipped off as slaves to the colonies. In Scotland they still call this period the Killing Time. What Charles II really wanted to do was return Britain to the Roman Catholic Faith. This story of Britain is the story of World. It was going on everywhere with one Faith persecuting another over the interpretation"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"142 of a flawed and largely invented book. Almost everything emerged from religion or the battle against religious tyranny. The two political parties at the time were divided on religious lines. The Tories (now Conservatives) were the Anglicans while the Whigs were largely Nonconformists. Through these decades of terrible religious intolerance and unrepresentative parliaments, many individuals made their contributions to human consciousness. Isaac Newton made several important scientific discoveries. He studied astronomy and advanced the development of the telescope. When he saw an apple fall from a tree it triggered a line of thought which led to him identifying the law of gravity. But he was also very much involved with the Brotherhood as a grand master of the Priory of Sion. Further discoveries by his successors would undermine the claims of religion. Writers like John Milton and John Bunyan opposed the behaviour of the Church and state, and Bunyan spent twelve years in Bedford Jail for refusing to accept the Anglican Faith. George Fox founded the Society of Friends (Quakers). He argued against the Church dictatorship and urged toleration, mercy, and peace. The Quakers have largely been the acceptable face of religion, opposing slavery and persecution. Fox was jailed for blasphemy and thousands of his supporters suffered the same fate. The Whigs were behind the next ‘coup’ on the British people. When Charles I died in 1685, his brother, James II began a bloody three year reign of terror which failed in its avowed attempt to restore Papal power to Britain when he was overthrown by the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688. The Whigs, a powerful group of English and Scottish Protestants, may have been a British political party, later to become the Liberals, but they were actually based in Holland. They had close links with the Dutch House of Orange and with William, Prince of Orange, who had married Mary, the daughter ofJames II. The House of Orange, like the German royal family, often used marriage to expand its power and effect bloodless takeovers of other countries. Another branch of the Brotherhood was set up to put William on the British throne. It was called the Orange Order and this still continues, particularly in Northern Ireland. It is one of the secret societies which fuels the fires of that ongoing Northern Ireland conflict. The Orange Order was pledged to make sure that Britain remained a Protestant country, and it was based on the principles of Freemasonry, a craft of which William was almost certainly a member, and William was to treat Irish Catholics so badly that the hatred of him there still festers through the generations. He was crowned William III and ruled over both Britain and"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"143 Holland. His wife became Mary II. It was now that the Bank of England was created in the image of the Bank of Amsterdam and the Brotherhood control of the financial system took a mighty step forward. The Bank of England scheme was presented by William Paterson, a Scot, but the British parliament was not terribly keen on the idea. They were, however, trapped by the Brotherhood. William and Mary had started a war with Catholic France and they orchestrated other conflicts also. These were costing the country so much of its wealth that Britain was in terrible debt. They could not put up taxes any higher without fear of rebellion, so they reluctantly accepted the Bank of England which would then issue lots of bits of paper representing money that did not exist and charge interest to the government (the people) for doing so. As William Bamley writes in The Gods of Eden: “The standard practice of bankers during that period was to issue notes four or five times in excess of their precious metals. The Bank of England, however, issued an incredible multiplication of 16 2 /3rds. The British Government agreed to borrow those notes and honour them as legal money for use in its purchases. The government accepted this plan because the government was not required to repay the initial loan, only the interest on the loan. Would not the Bank of England lose money on such a deal?” Not at all. “The face value of the loan notes were many times in excess of the value of the actual assets on which the notes were based. The interest on the loan in just one year surpassed the total value of the precious metals of the Bank of England! Specifically, the financiers had put together a total base of £72,000 of actual gold and silver. By issuing notes valued at 16 2 /3 times the base, the bank was able to make a loan of £1,200,000 in paper money. The yearly interest was 8 1 /3% which equalled £100,000. This amounted to a profit of £28, 000, or 39% in just one year!” And who paid for that, and still pays for this system of legalised theft today? The people. In toil, sweat, and suffering. Another Scot, John Law, an agent of the Brotherhood, would later become the Finance Minister of France and he set up a similar central bank there with disastrous consequences for the economy when too many notes"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"144 were issued and they became subsequently worth less money. More of them were required to buy goods and services and this is the nightmare called inflation. With the death of William, his sister Anne took the throne and then she was succeeded by the German House of Hanover, from which the House of Windsor, Britain’s present royal family, descends. The first Hanoverian King, George I, couldn’t even speak English! The Hanoverians were not welcomed by the people who could not see why Germans should be on the British throne. This allowed the House of Hanover to work a nice little earner. They refused to have a large British army, because they said they feared a coup given their unpopularity. And so they enlisted mercenary soldiers from their German homeland at a massive cost to the British people and at a large profit to themselves. At least religious persecution now began to diminish. It would not disappear, but it would start to fade. It took nearly another hundred years for Roman Catholics to be allowed to worship in public and the Irish had to wait for this right until 1829. The legal prejudice against Nonconformist Protestants lasted even longer. They were not allowed to sit in Parliament until 1828 and the Anglican Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were only opened to them in 1871. The Pope’s control of Britain was removed by Henry VIII and his daughter, Elizabeth I. Now the power of the monarchs to rule as the representative of God was similarly curtailed, as parliaments took over Government. But these were grossly unrepresentative parliaments and there was little liberation for the masses. You will identify many themes running through this very brief history. One is that those who fight for change in the name of freedom often have no regard for the freedom of others once they are in power. Catholics persecuted Protestants only for Protestants to persecute them when the opportunity arose. You still see this in tit-for-tat killings in today’s trouble spots. The gentry campaigned for parliamentary freedom and the end of royal dictatorship, only to deny democratic and human rights to those who might vote them out of power. The Parliamentary gentry ran the country for themselves, the Church, and, although many will not have realised it, the Brotherhood. Most people were in grinding poverty. There were no schools although the money could always be found to fight wars of acquisition and build churches. Lives were hard and short while Britain’s privileged grew richer and the empire expanded. This continued into the 19th century. Boys and girls of five were being"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"145 forced to work up to ninety hours a week, and they were often beaten if they fell asleep. Starving children were left to die in the gutter. They were sent up chimneys to clean them and, together with women, worked down the mines earning money for the Anglican Church. The Church received royalties on the profits of many pits and in Northumberland and Durham alone this was earning them £400,000 a year. This is still a lot of money today, but then it was a staggering sum. No wonder the Church hierarchy never complained at the treatment of the children, women, and miners. It was left to radicals who were often non-believers to put humanity and compassion ahead of religious doctrine. Not so the Church. As long as the poor wretches had agreed to be baptised, they were saved for all eternity, so why bother trying to improve their lot on Earth? What was happening to them was God’s will. At one time 223 offences were punishable by death, including stealing a handkerchief or anything worth over five shillings. Edmund Burke, the Whig politician and philosopher, reckoned it was possible to get anything through parliament that carried the death penalty. People, including children, were flogged in the streets and hanged in public. It was only in the 1960s that Britain abolished the death penalty. Many countries and some American states continue to indulge in this barbarism. Into the 19th century wives were still being sold to the highest bidder in British markets and the treatment of women in general was shocking in its inhumanity. The prisons were full of ‘debtors’ - people who could not afford to feed their families, and the poor people couldn’t go to law to fight their case, because the legal system was there primarily to provide an income for the legal profession - and control the people. It had nothing to do with justice. Widows and children of the poor were thrown out of their homes when their husbands or parents died. Beggars filled the streets. This was the world which 1,500 years of Christianity had visited upon Britain and the rest of Christendom. And where were the shouts of protest from the Church? Silence. Into the last century, Christendom was no further advanced than the Babylonians had been 5,000 years earlier. When Robert Raikes began to organise schools to teach children to read and write on Sundays (their only day off) the Anglican Church opposed them because some of the teachers were Nonconformists. In the 19th century Hannah"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"146 More was prosecuted by an Ecclesiastical Court for her attempts at educating people. The clergy believed that everything anyone needed to know was in the Bible and they also realised that education was bad news for them. If people started to think for themselves it was goodbye Church power. A bill of 1807 to introduce state education which was passed by the House of Commons was blocked by the Bishops in the House of Lords. This when only one in seventeen people in England could write. The efforts of other reformers like Joseph Lancaster to educate the young so frightened the Church that it began to take an interest in schools. It knew these non-believing reformers would insist on the teaching of knowledge and reason, not theology. Once the Church realised that education was now inevitable, it wanted to gain control of the curriculum. Still today in England we have Church of England controlled schools in some areas with the local vicar on the Board of Governors. The Bishops in the House of Lords also opposed every Reform Bill designed to widen the franchise and give people a greater say in who governs them. They even opposed legislation to abolish the death penalty for thefts of more than five shillings. The Christian Church civilised the world?? The credibility of the Church was fatally breached during the Victorian era in Britain which accelerated the emergence of scientific explanations for what had hitherto been explained by ludicrous theology. The Church was now fighting a rearguard action trying to stay upright as the ground slipped beneath its feet. Tradition and the close links of Church and state maintained its privileges and influence and this continues to the present day, but its power to dictate was fading. Unfortunately, most of the scientists who were undermining religion’s credibility with their claims and discoveries, people like Charles Darwin and countless others, were going too far in the other direction. They didn’t realise, and most of their successors still don’t, that the evolution of the physical body and that of the eternal us, the consciousness which activates the physical body, are not the same. We were now being offered a choice between the ridiculous contentions of Christianity which were fast losing ground, and the materialist scientists who claimed that the physical world is all that exists and life after death is a myth. This view, which to me is as equally bereft of credibility as religion, remains the stance of the scientific establishment to this day, though not for much longer. It was also exactly what the Brotherhood elite wanted to happen as a"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"147 key part of its New World Order. A world without God or belief in an eternal self was its ambition, even though it knew and knows the truth of who we really are. Religion would continue to be used when appropriate, but the aim was really to replace that with the view of a godless science in the minds of the people. “It is with this object in view that we are constantly, by means of our press, arousing a blind confidence in these (scientific) theories. The intellectuals of the Goyim will puff themselves up with their knowledge and without any logical verification of it will put into affect all the information available from science, which our agentur specialists have cunningly pieced together for the purpose of educating their minds in the direction we want . Do not suppose for a moment that these statements are empty words: think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinism . . . (Protocol 2). It is indispensible to undermine all faith, to tear out of the minds of the Goyim the very principle of Godhead and the spirit, and to put in its place arithmetical calculations and material needs.” (Protocol 4). Are you listening university lecturers, science students, and establishment scientists? You have been and continue to be duped. The British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, could see some of what was going on when he said this in the House of Commons in July 1856: “There is in Italy a power which we seldom mention in this House. I mean the secret societies.. It is useless to deny, because it is impossible to conceal that a great part of Europe, the whole of Italy and France, and a great part of Germany, to say nothing of other countries, is covered with a network of secret societies, just as the surfaces of the earth are covered with railroads. And what are their objects? .... They do not want constitutional goverrnment, they do not want ameliorated institutions.. they want to change the tenure of the land, to drive out the present owners of the soil, and put an end to the ecclesiastical establishments. Some may even go further.” One of the groups in Italy he was referring to was the Mafia. Giuseppe Garibaldi, a thirty-third degree Mason and Grand Master of Italy, had led the rebellion in the Italian wars of unification and the Mafia, up until then a secret society resisting foreign rule in Sicily,"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"148 supported him. The Mafia formed an underground government in Sicily and used criminal acts to undermine the foreign occupation. When Italy was unified, the Mafia became the underground terrorist and criminal movement it is today. One of the most notorious freemason lodges is also based in Italy. It is known as P2 and it controls the Vatican. We saw our familiar theme at work again in these Victorian and Edwardian times. The science which had for so long been suppressed and crushed by the Church, was winning its freedom to research and discover knowledge which the priests would rather have remained hidden. But when open minded scientists found evidence to challenge the materialist this-world-is-all-there-is view of the establishment scientists their work was likewise suppressed and crushed by their own colleagues. Instead of one powerful interest group suggesting that reincarnation and eternal life for everyone did not exist, now there were two. The last thing the Brotherhood wanted was for the population to know the spiritual truths. Both ‘science’ and religion were fierce in their opposition to the growth in interest in Spiritualism during the Victorian era. Mediums were, until 1951, liable to a fine and imprisonment for the crime of being a medium, but their art began to return to public attention thanks to the emergence of Spiritualism. The law of the land incorporated the Church’s contention that contact with the ‘dead’ was impossible and therefore anyone claiming to do so must by definition be a fraud. Little did the people know that Queen Victoria had a medium working with her for many years after the death of her husband, Albert, the Prince Consort. Arthur Findlay revealed the story for the first time in The Curse of Ignorance in 1947. He was given the details by the daughter of James Robert Lees who, as a thirteen year old, was found to have outstanding psychic gifts. One communicator claimed to be the entity who had been Prince Albert and he asked that he be allowed to speak with Victoria. The Queen, who had been grief-stricken by his death, heard of this and sent along two members of her court to investigate. They posed as members of the public who wanted to see what the boy could do. He began to channel Prince Albert, who proceeded to greet the two courtiers by their correct names and he said he knew they had been sent by Victoria. He gave them information for the Queen that only he could have known. He also wrote a letter to her through the hand"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"149 of Robert Lees, a process called automatic writing. The contents greatly impressed the Queen, and Robert was invited to meet her and channel Albert in her presence. She was not in the least phased by all this, because she had experienced sittings with other mediums before the Prince’s death. She invited Robert to become a permanent member of her court where he could channel her husband whenever she wished. But Albert said he could communicate through the son of a worker on her Balmoral estate, a man called John Brown. He was summoned, and a long relationship began between John and the Queen. Through him, Albert would advise her throughout the rest of her life. When John Brown died the Queen wrote about him and intended to publish her work, but she was persuaded not to do so by her Private Secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, and Dr. Davidson, the Dean of Windsor and later Archbishop of Canterbury. He had long opposed her interest in Spiritualism and threatened to resign as Court Chaplain if she published anything about John Brown. Ponsonby also destroyed Brown’s private diaries to make sure the truth was never revealed. Spiritualism, the belief in the ability to communicate with discarnate souls, had begun in the United States in the mid 1800s and spread to Europe. In Britain it had a number of famous advocates including the scientists Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William Crookes, and Sir William Barrett, and the writers Victor Hugo and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The scientists were dismissed by their fellows, but they had begun to understand the nature of vibrations and how many worlds could share the same space. Conan Doyle dedicated his later life to the cause of Spiritualism at a time when the escapologist, Houdini, was running a virtual witch hunt against mediums in the United States. In 1938, a committee appointed by the Church reported favourably on its investigations into Spiritualism, but Dr Lang the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to publish it. He was, however, quite happy to pass into the public arena the report of another committee at that time which supported belief in the Anglican Church’s Thirty-nine Articles of Faith. As twenty-one of the twenty- five members of the committee were priests we should not be surprised at their verdict. If only Victoria and others had stood up and revealed their experiences and beliefs, the suppression of knowledge by Church and science would have been broken by now. Instead it is left to our generations to do it."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"150 The movement and religion of Spiritualism deserves great credit for keeping the understandings alive in the face of tremendous opposition from the Church and materialist science. The scientists became dominant in the public mind, and although medicine progressed enormously in its understanding, it, too, failed to acknowledge that there is more to the human being than a physical body. Again the materialist view held sway in medicine and the foundations of the ‘tradition’ thus created are still with us today. The most important advances in human health were the improvement in sanitation and water supplies, although atrocious poverty and terrible living conditions remained the lot of the majority. This was despite the increasing wealth of the rich and the country in general gained through the exploitation of the people and the Empire. In this period from Victoria to the present day the world would discover the means of mass production; electricity; radio; television; the telephone; the aeroplane; spacecraft; the list goes on and on. The freedom of many human minds from the religious thought-police unleashed so much potential - more than the public have been told about, as we shall discuss later. But cleverness is one thing, wisdom quite another. The invention of the steam engine revolutionised production and the exploitation of oil would give us the petrol engine. All over the world inventions and discoveries were coming to light which changed the nature of work, life, and the potential for both construction and catastrophe. I will look at the economic and environmental consequences of this in chapter 11, but here I wish to expand on the difference between cleverness and wisdom. To unlock the secrets of nature’s potential is clever, but it takes wisdom to (a) use that knowledge for positive and constructive purposes and (b) to have the humility to appreciate that there is always, but always, a great deal more to know. As Socrates said: “Wisdom is knowing how little we know”. The scientist Carl Sagan was also correct when he pointed out that intellectual capacity is no guarantee against being dead wrong. The Victorian and post- Victorian world has not understood that and humility has rarely been a feature of the human condition among those in power. So the true nature of life and creation went on being ignored by the Church and the scientific establishment, even though Socrates and Plato had known the basis of it in Ancient Greece. Cleverness without wisdom is also the bringer of war. Wise people would have used and expanded their gathering knowledge for the benefit of all, and by"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"151 that I don’t mean only those in their own country. All means all. Instead the collective mind of humanity was still reacting like a spoilt child being guided along a destructive path by the Illuminati elite. Whatever is the dominating belief of the collective mind can have an enormous influence on the way individuals think. Unfortunately, as we have seen, the behaviour of Church, Brotherhood and State over the period covered in this book has programmed the collective consciousness to pass on its responsibility to think and act to others, the Pope, priests, kings and queens, dictators, gentry, bosses, the Bible, the Koran, whoever and whatever they can find. Humanity in general has been programmed to think and behave like robots and to indoctrinate their children to do the same. This they have done. When you look at all the slaughter, the invasions and counter4nvasions, the bloody persecutions over minute differences in the same religious faith, the mass of the people never benefited from any of them. When a place was plundered by an army, the proceeds and the power didn’t go to them, but to those they blindly followed and, increasingly, to those they didn’t even know about. People may believe those days are over, but they’re not, you know. There is still an enormous amount to do to free the human mind from subservience and indoctrination. Through the Victorian period while reforms were won by courageous and compassionate people under fierce opposition by the Church and other self4nterest groups, the old beliefs were still there. The tribes had become communities, then states, and now they had formed together into countries and nations. The way they came together was no foundation for their future peace and stability. Often it was the result of one religion or belief being imposed upon everyone through Brotherhood4nspired invasion or civil war, and the resentment simmered away until the oppressed could get their revenge, encouraged by other Brotherhood groups. Everyone believed that they were doing what was right without realising that a higher, secret force, was pulling their strings and taking advantage of their sense of injustice. Some parts of Europe changed hands so many times they must have woken up in the morning and asked who was in charge that day. Among these political and military rugby balls were Bosnia, Serbia, Herzegovina and Montenegro, and the bitter resentment at this and each other has exploded again in this decade in a terrible religious and ethnic war. The Turks, Greeks, Germans,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"152 French, Italians, Spanish, British, Dutch, Russians, anyone with sufficient military muscle, fought and squabbled with each other over who should add different countries or regions to their empires of exploitation. School children arguing over sweets would have shown more maturity.

By the end of the 19th century this powder keg had to blow, and it did in a series of conflicts leading to the two World Wars. And the knowledge gained by materialist science was used to create weapons with a greater destructive potential than ever before."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"153 10 The World at War In the early years of the 20th century, Brotherhood bankers and industrialists were expanding their control of the world financial system. Two names were particularly prominent, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. The Rockefellers are one of America’s best-known families. They became famous afterJohn Davidson Rockefeller and his brother, William, made their fortune with the highly-controversial Standard Oil Company with its web of financial wheeler-dealing which noone could fathom. J.D.Rockefeller’s grandson, Nelson, would become a Vice-President of the United States and play a leading part behind the scenes, too, in the course of US politics. The Rothschilds are a European banking dynasty started by Meyer Amschel Rothschild who was born in Germany in 1744. The name comes from the red (rot) shield on the house in a ghetto in which Meyer’s ancestors once lived. By 1820, the Rothschild empire had branches in London, Paris, Vienna and Naples. They made vast profits from the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars of 1792 to 1815 and had a very significant influence on the course of European history. They diversified into railways, coal and other industrial investments. Meyer Amschel Rothschild summed up the approach of the Brotherhood bankers and the Illuminati elite when he said: “Give me control over a nation’s currency, and I care not who makes the ]’ laws.’’ The Rockefeller and Rothschild empires will feature in the story from now on, but I want to stress most emphatically that I will be highlighting certain individual people and the way in which the empires have been used. I do not wish to suggest that everyone called Rockefeller or Rothschild is involved. Most of them will not know what is going on either."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"154 At the centre of the gathering empire of the banking and industrial elite was the Round Table. This had been founded, quite possibly with the best of intentions, by an Englishman, Cecil Rhodes, after whom Rhodesia was named, before its independence. Supported by the Rothschild empire, he made a colossal fortune exploiting the diamond reserves and resources of South Africa. Rhodes often expressed a desire to stop wars by creating a world government, centred on Britain, which could intervene in disputes before they became violent. In 1891 he set up his now infamous Round Table which was obviously inspired by the King Arthur stories. It was designed on Brotherhood lines with secret rituals, inner and outer circles, and much of the other paraphernalia of such organisations. Among the supporters of the Round Table were Lord Rothschild, head of the Rothschild empire in England, and another English banker, Alfred Milner. But it was after Rhodes died* in 1902 that the big switch was made and the Illuminati, in classic fashion, hijacked his creation. The international Brotherhood bankers began to give the Round Table substantial financial support and these backers included the Rockefellers. The Round Table was used to coordinate the activities of central banks and Brotherhood bankers across the world and to increase enormously their influence on governments. The Table created other branches to further, and also to mask, its activities. Adam Weishaupt, a German professor who started a famous branch of the Illuminati in 1776, said: “The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment; let it never appear in its own name, but always covered by another name, another occupation.” These ‘front’ organisations were to include the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, and, in the British Empire, the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Both were created to direct the foreign policy of governments to suit Brotherhood ambitions. David Rockefeller was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations for many years. Today it has infiltrated its people and policies throughout United States government. This Brotherhood illuminati elite began to infiltrate the universities and the media, and this is now widespread. It controls the media, for sure. Dr Carrol Quigley wrote of this time: * Cecil Rhodes bequeathed large sums of money to found the “Rhodes Scholarships” to Oxford University for overseas students and to promote his belief in a one world government. The most famous “Rhodes Scholar” today is Bill Clinton."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"155 “There grew up in the 20th century a power structure between London and New York which penetrated deeply into university lift, the Press, and the practice of foreign policy. In England the centre was the Round Table group, while in the United States it was J.P. Morgan and Company, or its local branches in Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland.” The aim of the Brotherhood banking and political network was to create a world financial system in which the central banks and other private banking interests would work together. They would coordinate their activities to control governments and economies by creating booms and busts, manipulating foreign exchanges and bribing politicians with well-paid jobs in the financial world. You can see all of these things happening daily every time you pick up a newspaper. The centre of this banking network was to be the Bank for International Settlements, based in Basle, Switzerland. The overwhelming aim of this banking cartel was to create a situation in which governments were so deeply in debt to them that they had to do as the bankers demanded. Like lambs to the slaughter, governments all over the world have fallen for it, or, through Brotherhood channels, helped to arrange it, the United States, more than anyone. The idea of a central bank inventing money that doesn’t exist has long been controversial in America. Two of its founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, wanted any such bank to be under government control. They could see the dangers of any other system. But another, Alexander Hamilton, was determined to create a Central Bank in private hands. His backers were reputed to be the Bank of England and the Rothschilds. By 1786, the US was plunged into its first major economic depression caused by the lending and interest policies of the money-out-of-nothing banks, including Hamilton’s own Bank of New York. Heavy taxes were levied on the population to pay for the interest on bank loans to the federal government and the state authorities. Farmers were ruined by the banks and Captain Daniel Shay led two thousand desperate farmers to take over a number of towns in Massachusetts, most famously Worcester. They wanted an end to interest banking, but Shay’s Rebellion, as it was termed, was put down. When George Washington became President in 1789, he made Hamilton the Secretary to the Treasury. Two years later, Hamilton got his way when the Bank of the United States, the new nation’s first"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"156 central bank, opened its doors. It was privately owned, but the Government entrusted to it the country’s finances. Only five years later, the taxes imposed on the people were so high, to pay the interest on borrowing from this bank, that farmers again rebelled, this time in western Pennsylvania. This socalled Whisky Rebellion was crushed on the orders of George Washington. The Bank of the United States lost its power in the 1830s when President Andrew Jackson won his ‘bank war’ against Nicholas Biddle, the president of the bank. But, early in the next century, this would be replaced by today’s Federal Reserve system, the private banking network that controls the US economy for its own benefit. President Woodrow Wilson came to office in 1909 and one of his close aides was a man called Colonel House. It was House who actually controlled events and his masters were the Brotherhood banking interests, not the American people. His brief from the bankers was to ensure that the administration introduced the Federal Reserve system and the income tax bill known as the Federal Income Tax Amendment (the 16th Amendment to the American Constitution). This combination would be the means of controlling the US economy. The Federal Reserve would lend the government enormous amounts of largely4nvented money to boost the economy and, when it suited the bankers, the Federal Income Tax Amendment would suppress the economy by raising taxation. The manner in which both were introduced raised much criticism. President Wilson must have had some idea of what was going on behind the scenes. He once talked of “A power so organised, so complete, so persuasive, that they had better not speak above their breaths when they speak in condemnation of it.” Persuading people to do what you want them to do, while believing they are doing the opposite is a method constantly used by the Brotherhood. The Federal Reserve Bill was painted as a measure to curtail the power of banking interests and those same interests opposed the idea to add to the conjuring trick. The plot was hatched at a meeting of Illuminati bankers and industrialists at Jekyll Island, Georgia, towards the end of 1910. The location of the meeting was extremely symbolic in that, while the Brotherhood was playing Dr Jekyll, it was really Mr Hyde. The Federal Reserve Bill was pushed through Congress in the last few days before Christmas 1913 and Congressman Charles A Lindbergh, senior, the father of the aviator, recognised the sleight of hand for what it was. He said that the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"157 financial insiders had only opposed the Federal Reserve legislation because they wished to promote the fiction that it was a ‘People’s Bill’. He added: “This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on Earth......When the President signs this Act, the invisible government by the money power, proven to exist by the Money Trust Investigation will be legalised. The new law will create inflation whenever the trust wants inflation. “The Federal Reserve was, and still is, hailed as a victory for democracy over the Money Trust. Nothing could be further from the truth. The whole Central Bank concept was engineered by the very group it was supposed to strip of power.” The Federal Reserve system has refused to be audited since the day it was formed. It is so important for everyone to lift their eyes from what appears to be a certain situation, because this type of double bluff is being used all the time to make us act in the interests of the Illuminati, while thinking we are doing the opposite. When the plan was first presented by the Republicans it was rejected by Congress. There was a feeling in the public mind that the Republicans were too close to banking interests. The Brotherhood had an answer for that. They got the Democrats to present it and it was passed! Only two states agreed to the Federal Income Tax Amendment and it required at least thirty-six if it was to be legally ratified. When this was obviously not going to happen, the Secretary of State, Filander Knox, simply told Congress in 1913 that the amendment had been ratified, even though it had not. From that moment, all the income tax paid under the Act through the Internal Revenue Service has been purely voluntary (although everyone is told it’s the law) and all the money that people have been forced to pay by the IRS has been a theft! The IRS is a private organisation controlling the federal tax system of America, and it is a Brotherhood tool*. The financial network, led by the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and others, was now in place for the biggest Brotherhood project so far - the First World War. In the first years of this century a number of secret, mystical societies in Germany began to promote the idea of a master race. * A secret document “Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars” reveals that the IRS passes personal details about American people to the Brotherhood manipulators."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"158 They claimed the white Aryan race was superior to all the others and said the Germans were a part of that. The myth of the German Aryan master race had begun. An English-born writer, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, was a great supporter of this view. He believed that Germany could breed a super-race to lead Europe into a New Order. He was fiercely anti-Jewish. Wilhelm II, the Kaiser of Germany, was another religious fanatic who believed he was God’s representative on Earth. He was an avid reader of Chamberlain’s work and met him to discuss their mutual belief that Germans were God’s chosen people and should rule the whole of Europe, if not the world. He dismissed his Chancellor, Bismark, in 1890 and assumed control of the country. You would have thought the people would have resisted this but, once again, we see the consequences of human dependence on someone else to tell them what to do, which had been part of life for centuries. Wilhelm prepared for war. The Prussian Hohenzollern dynasty, of which Wilhelm was a member, had been encouraging the unification of Germany and building up its war machine for many years. There was an outbreak of conflicts around Europe rather like musical chairs. Alliances were agreed on religious and political grounds but, mostly, countries were looking around for allies to support them in the increasingly-likely event of attack. Wilhelm was waiting for any excuse to make his play for European domination, and it came in 1914. The mutual dislike between Austria and Serbia came to a head when the Archduke Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. The Austrians accused the Serbs of involvement in the murder and sent an ultimatum. The Serbs agreed to all but two of its demands, and asked for those to be decided by arbitration. But the Austrians and Germans wanted a fight and Austria declared war on Serbia. Russia supported Serbia. Who actually killed Ferdinand to create the spark for what followed? A Serbian secret society called the Black Hand. Count Czerin, a friend of Ferdinand, said, “The Archduke knew quite well that the risk of an attempt on his life was imminent. A year before the war he informed me that the freemasons had resolved on his death”. Wilhelm declared war on Russia and France. His idea was that Germany would win a swift battle with France before turning its full might on Russia. The Germans invaded Belgium and entered France from the north. Britain declared war on Germany and the bloodiest"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"159 conflict in human history was underway. Germany didn’t win the quick victory over the French she had hoped for. It became a war of attrition in the trenches of Northern France. There, in the mud and desolation, European manhood died in its millions to win or defend a few acres of devastated land. Scientific knowledge was used to improve the efficiency with which humanity slaughtered each other, and never had this been achieved on a greater scale than this. The battles are written in the memory forever of anyone who wishes to see an end to the stupidity and manipulation that has diverted humankind from its true purpose. Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, saw millions killed on both sides, often in suicidal assaults on well-fortified trenches, on the orders of insane generals. Turkey entered the war on Germany’s side, but Italy supported Britain on the promise of being given Trentino and Trieste. They opened a front against Austria, while Britain was becoming increasingly stretched by the need to support the French Western Front and protect their interests in India and Egypt from the Turks. It was now that T.E.Lawrence, ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, organised a revolt by the Arabs against the Turks. The British went on to occupy Palestine, Jerusalem and Mesopotamia. The courage and determination of the Russian people in defending their land from the Germans, at a cost of four million casualties, had done much to stretch the German resources and reduce their ability to break through in France. But, in 1917, they agreed a peace treaty with Germany after the Russian revolution or, rather, the Russian Brotherhood Revolution. There had been riots and unrest for a long time over the often cruel persecution of the people by the Tsars. There were strikes and mutinies in the Russian army, and Tsar Nicholas II was taken to Siberia where he and his family were executed by a bunch of extreme revolutionaries who were no more enlightened in their humanity than the Tsars they removed. The more moderate reformers were cast aside by the followers of Lenin and Trotsky. They abolished plans for a parliamentary constitution and imposed upon an already oppressed people the Communist State which replaced Tsarist fascism with state fascism.

Coil’s Masonic Encyclopaedia says that there was a Supreme Masonic Council in Russia with forty subordinate groups at the start of the war. Tsar Alexander had become so concerned at the agenda of Russian freemasonry that he had banned the craft in August 1822 when its own Grand Master had warned him that it was a threat to the state and should be stopped or reorganised. You can see that the Brotherhood does not speak only with one voice. Playing one against the other is all part of the strategy. This decree was renewed by Tsar Nicholas but, as freemasonry is a secret society, the subversion went on. It was right that the Tsar’s abuse of power should end but, again, it is the secret agenda behind this that we have to watch. The Germans naturally supported Lenin and gave him safe passage in a sealed train across Germany from Switzerland on his way to Russia, because they wanted them to withdraw the Russians from the war. They also gave him and his Bolshevik revolutionaries tens of thousands of marks for propaganda and to make sure the revolution succeeded. What a surprise, then, that after Lenin 5 coup against the provisional ‘people’s government’ the Russians pulled out of the war and allowed the Germans to concentrate on other fronts! The Communists were supported by German and other Western bankers and financiers. The German banker, Max Warburg, supported Lenin’s regime. So did the American banker, Jacob Schiff. His family originated in Germany where it had enjoyed close links with the Rothschild banking empire, the key financial supporter of the revolution. The father of modern Communism and of the beliefs which the Bolsheviks promoted is said to be Karl Marx, who died in 1883. He was a member of a Brotherhood organisation, the League of the Just (later the Communist League), an offshoot of the Society of the Seasons which played a major part in the French Revolution. The German industrialist, Friedrich Engels, supported Marx and wrote with him the Communist Manifesto on behalf of the secret societies which were behind them. Fifteen international bankers used the cover of a Red Cross mission in 1918 to travel to Petrograd to support the original revolution, the provisional ‘people’s government’, and the Bolsheviks who would replace it. Professor Stuart Crane pointed out the scam:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"161 “If you look back at every war in Europe......you will see that they always ended with the establishment of a balance of power. With every reshuffling there was a balance of power in a new grouping around the House of Rothschild in England, France, or Austria. They grouped nations so that if any king got out of line, a war would break out and the war would be decided by which way the financing went. Researching the debt positions of the warring nations will usually indicate who was being punished.” Or as the Illuminati Protocols put it in the 1800s: “Throughout all Europe, and by means of relations with Europe, in other continents also, we must create ferments, discords and hostility. Therein we gain a double advantage. In the first place we keep in check all countries, for they well know that we have the power whenever we like to create disorders or to restore order . . . . In the second place, by our intrigues we shall tangle up all the threads which we have stretched into the cabinets of all states by means of politics, by economic treaties, or loan obligations. In order to succeed in this we must use great cunning and penetration during negotiations and agreements, but, as regards what is called the ‘official language’ we shall keep to the opposite tactics and assume the mask of honesty and compliancy . . . . We must be in a position to respond to every act of opposition by war with the neighbours of that country which dares to oppose us: but if these neighbours should also venture to stand collectively against us, then we must offer resistance by a universal war.” (Protocol 7) Communism was a form of designer politics created by the Brotherhood as an opposition to the ‘free’ society of America. Millions of dollars of Brotherhood money* was poured into the Russian revolution because the fear of a Russian ‘bogeyman’ was going to be used when the time was right. Russia became a bogeyman on ice waiting to be exploited thirty years later.

Gold is their great economic weapon."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"162 in a godless world was exactly what the Brotherhood wished the masses to believe. The secret societies of the Brotherhood had taken control of the intelligence agencies that had emerged since the 17th century and so it was with the Tsarist intelligence agency, the Okhrana. There is great illusion that the secret services of the world are set up in opposition to each other when, in fact, at the highest level, well above anyone known to the public, they work largely as one unit. Even the lower levels of these agencies don’t realise that, but they are stooges for the Brotherhood, too. Intelligence agencies are organisations (the Brotherhood) within organisations. There is a secret world government which is continually destabilising and directing the actions of nation states. In typical Brotherhood fashion, Lenin and the Bolsheviks were attacking the Tsar for the brutality of the Okhrana while, behind the scenes, the Okhrana were supporting the Lenin revolution! The Okhrana were supplying funds and undermining the revolutionary opposition to the Bolsheviks, while many of the main protagonists within the Bolshevik movement were its members. The soon-to-be Soviet dictator, joseph Stalin, was, at the very least, extremely close to the Okhrana, probably a member. The first editor of the Communist mouthpiece, Pravda, was from there. It is no surprise, therefore, that when Lenin and his supporters came to power, the intelligence agency they apparently so hated and condemned was greatly expanded and given a change of name - from Okhrana to the KGB. The revolution of the people was just another ball and chain in disguise. There was a considerable Jewish flavour to the revolution, and the Brotherhood was now preparing the ground for a return of the Jews to Palestine. Some research I have seen claims that, of 388 members of the Russian Revolutionary Government in 1918, only sixteen were Russians by birth. All but two of the rest were Jews from elsewhere, mostly from New York. How people have been tricked right through the ages to the present day. The Brotherhood was deeply involved in all the ‘people’s revolutions’ which exploded after the American War of Independence. This includes, as we have seen, the French Revolution which led to the extermination of at least 100,000 people in the Reign of Terror that followed. The blow for the Allies of losing Russian support against the Germans in World War I was compensated by the arrival of the Americans. President Woodrow Wilson led them into the war when"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"163 Germany began a policy of sinking all shipping of whatever nationality, or rather that’s what the allies said. The sinking of the American ship, the Lusitania, was simply the excuse President Wilson had been looking for to justify entering the war, and I have no doubt that the sinking was manufactured by him in collusion with the British. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would be used by President Franklin D Roosevelt in the same way in the Second World War. As Commander Joseph Kenworthy of British Naval Intelligence said: “The Lusitania was deliberately sent at considerably reduced speed into an area where a U-boat was known to be waiting and with her escort withdrawn.” The Lusitania was carrying military supplies for Great Britain and was not, as the Americans claimed, merely a passenger vessel. Slowly, after the US soldiers arrived in Europe, the initiative turned against Germany and Wilhelm surrendered and abdicated, to be allowed to live out his life in comfort in the Netherlands. With his going, the German monarchy ended. This was the war which had been fought for the first time with the submarine, aeroplane and tank and this had taken everything onto a new level of horror and destruction. By the time it ended, tens of millions of men, women and children had lost their lives in a war manufactured by the Brotherhood for its own purposes. Words just cannot describe how that makes you feel. Germany was ordered to pay reparations to the nations she had attacked and agreed to accept strict limitations on the size of her armed forces. The Austrian Empire was divided into the individual states of Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, an amalgamation of Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Dalmatia and Bosnia Herzegovina. The colonies of the defeated countries were shared out among the victors under the heading of ‘protectorates’. Syria went to France while Britain was handed Palestine, Jordan and Iraq. It’s hard to believe that countries could be passed around like this, but it happened in this century. In Britain, the war had hastened social reform and the widening of the franchise. After the French Revolution in 1789, the British gentry had been so terrified that it added yet more capital offences to the statute book and imposed even harsher laws against rebellion of any kind. But, when they could see their possessions under threat from a"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"164 foreign power, they began to make concessions to the oppressed, because they knew they needed them to defend their wealth. Also, with every widening of the franchise, the power of the upper class elite was curtailed, though not that of the Brotherhood elite. The rights of all children to an education had to be won in stages against Church and factory-owner opposition but, in 1918, came the most important victory yet in the form of the Education Act. This ensured a full-time education for all children up to the age of fourteen, and ended the practice of children going to work for half the day and school for the rest. It also introduced nursery schools and medical checks for children at school. The only sad thing was that the Church would continue to have a significant say in the education of children with the Bible taught as if it were historical fact. This continues even today. The most significant development in the years between the wars was the rise of the dictator to replace monarchs and fledgling democracies. Here again it shows how desperate are the people for someone to lead them and tell them when to breathe; how the Brotherhood exploited that! The American President, Woodrow Wilson, proposed an organisation called the League of Nations after the First World War, to arbitrate disputes between countries before they became violent. It was a fine idea in theory, but, in practice, it was the first tentative and unsuccessful attempt at a centralised body on which to base a World Government. The Brotherhood is very adept at presenting something in terms that seem highly laudable, which can brilliantly obscure the hidden agenda. The League of Nations struggled into life but quickly collapsed because everyone ignored it. The support of the Roman Catholic Church for the dictators is not surprising. Its survival depends on the suppression of knowledge and the imposition of belief. Here we were in the first thirty-odd years of this century, seeing the expansion of education, materialistic sciences and more democratic political systems and the Roman Church was getting very worried as support for Christianity fell away. They knew that what they needed was a return to the old days of repression and oppression when they ran the show. The Vatican has also been run to a larger or lesser extent by the Brotherhood for centuries, probably from the start, and if; by mistake, they elect a Pope who won’t play the game, he conveniently dies, as was the case with Pope John Paul I in 1978. His successor, Pope John Paul II, has recinded a ban on"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"165 freemasonry imposed by Pope Clement XII in 1738. Clement at least knew what was going on and wished to stop it. In 1978, the year John Paul II took the papal throne, a special issue of Vatican stamps featured the triangle and all-seeing eye. Celebrating an Illuminati victory, perhaps? Pope Pius XI and those who controlled the Vatican saw Benito Mussolini as the man who could lead them to a return to past glories. The global financial crash of the 1920s brought great hardship which proved fertile ground for a dictator to step forward and hoodwink the people into believing he had their best interests at heart. Mussolini, the son of a blacksmith, came to power in the accepted way of dictators, through bribery, corruption, murder and support from the secret societies. He was obsessed with restoring the Roman Empire and his brand of violence and patriotism were so successful that the king gave him control of the state to avoid a civil war. Once ensconced, he removed all democratic rights and freedom of expression. The Roman Catholic Church supported him in all of this. He knew that he could have free and constant propaganda from the pulpits of Italy if he had the Church on his side. They were given the Vatican City with independence from Italy, and the Church was given control, once more, of all education along with a donation of £19 million. When Mussolini invaded Abyssinia the Pope gave him his full support. It was the same when Mussolini went for Albania and Greece. Nothing would have delighted the Roman Catholic leaders more than to have control over the lands of the Greek Orthodox Church they so hated. These two Christian creeds had parted company, you will recall, after the Pope added the words ‘and from the Son’ (the Filoque) to the Christian creed in 1054. Many Christians refused to accept this and they formed the breakaway Orthodox Church which later looked on Moscow as its own particular Rome or Mecca. Seventy thousand Jews were banished from Italy by Mussolini without a single word of protest from the Vatican. Italy was now controlled by a double dictatorship of Church and State, and both of them were controlled by the Brotherhood. The Pope was also on friendly terms with Adolf Hitler after a large Roman Catholic vote swept him to power in Germany in 1933. Germany was in a desperate state, a country in physical and economic ruin after the war. With the end of the monarchy, a republic was declared at a meeting at Weimar in 1919, but it was always"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"166 struggling against Communist, royalist, far right, and Brotherhood opposition. Most of all, it was destroyed by a collapsed economy. But then, if you control the financial system, undermining a country to prepare the ground for a revolution is no problem. The 1929 Wall Street crash in the United States was similarly engineered. The Brotherhood bankers created inflation and encouraged the stock market to overstretch itself; so making a crash inevitable. All the stock markets of the world are manipulated in this way. The Depression of the 1920s was the time of the ‘Turkey Shoot’, as it was known. By 1921, there were 31,076 banks in the U.S. The giant banks of the Brotherhood elite decided it was time to reap their harvest. The Federal Reserve announced a series of new regulations which they realised the smaller banks could not meet in such bleak economic conditions. This forced thousands of them out of business - 16,000 failed in eleven years. The Brotherhood bankers had destroyed the competition. They increased their own assets by absorbing the failed small fry and all those in debt to them. The Federal Reserve, having achieved its task, then reduced the toughness of the regulations. Franklin D Roosevelt, with support from these elite bankers, announced his famous New Deal policy to lift the U.S. out of depression. This involved the government borrowing enormous sums from the bankers and the debt of government and population exploded again. Congressman Louis McFadden, a Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, said that the Great Depression of the 1920s.... ...... was not accidental. It was a carefully contrived occurrence.... The International Bankers sought to bring about conditions of despair here, so they might emerge as rulers ofus all.” It was the same in Germany where the seeds of dictatorship were sown. Enter Adolf Hitler, a former house painter and First World War lance-corporal, who had been much impressed by the methods employed by Mussolini. But Hitler’s obsession with Germany as the master Aryan race went back much further. As a youth he would take hallucinogenic drugs to stimulate his mystical experiences. The swastika, which Hitler was to use as the emblem of his Nazi party, was a Brotherhood symbol going back to ancient times. He was much impressed as a youngster by a book-shop owner in Vienna who preached the gospel of the German super-race, which some believed"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"167 was created by extra-terrestrial giants. Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the writer who so influenced Kaiser Wilhelm, was later to claim that Hitler was the new messiah, and Chamberlain’s work would become the basis of Nazi philosophy. Hitler’s rise to German Dictator quickened rapidly after he joined the secret political branch of the Army District Command which was a law unto itself. It was so deeply patriotic that it assassinated, for crimes against the nation, some of the people who had negotiated the peace terms for Germany at the end of the First World War. The District Command was really the assassination wing of a secret Brotherhood group called the Thule Society which believed in all the nonsense about the super-race and the German messiah. It sentenced people to death in its own secret ‘courts’. Hitler and the Thule Society believed they were being guided by the extra-terrestrials who had created the Aryan race, or what they said was a race. The same industrialists financed both the Thule Society and the District Command. Deitrich Eckart, the morphine addict who headed the Thule Society, saw Hitler as the Messiah figure they had been looking for. They ensured that he became the leader of the German Workers’ Party. This was transformed into the fascist National Socialist (Nazi) Party and Hitler sought to spread his anti- Jewish, anti-communist nationalism to the entire world. His creed captured the collective mind of Germany which tuned to the thought waves of fascism until it was hypnotised and controlled by the rantings of this misguided man. He had increased his standing before his election by having his Gestapo4n-waiting burn down the German Parliament building, the Reichstag, in 1933, for which he blamed the communists. He also used the fear of the Russians to great effect. In this he was helped by the Pope who spread hatred of Communist Russia at every opportunity. The churches had been mortified when Lenin’s revolution banned religion. They didn’t know they had been double-crossed by the same Brotherhood they believed was supporting them. Two other secret societies which played a part in the Nazi revolution were the Vril Society and the Edelweiss Society. Like the Thules, they had links with their brethren in Britain. Rudolph Hess and Heinrich Himmler were both ‘Vrils’ - Himmler was to head the appalling Nazi Gestapo and SS. Hermann Goering was a member of the Edelweiss Society and believed that Hitler was the Nordic Messiah he was convinced was expected. Hitler and his cronies"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"168 denounced the Jews and Communists on the radio day after day, as he poisoned the German mind to his creed. He followed the example of Church and dictators throughout history. Any literature advocating freedom of any kind was destroyed, and promises he made to the socialists and monarchists who helped to elect him were forgotten. There would be no more elections. The Fuhrer would be obeyed. Around him he gathered his principle officers like Goebbels, Ribbentrop, Goering, and Himmler. They would rule Germany by terror, and millions of Jews would be murdered in the gas chambers and concentration camps. Ribbentrop was to have several cosy conversations with the Pope about Germany’s expansion plans, although the main agent of the secret Vatican-Germany-America alliance was Rudolph Hess. So now there were dictators in Italy, Germany, and Russia, where Joseph Stalin had succeeded Lenin in 1924. Soon there would be another in Spain. In 1936 General Franco, a Roman Catholic extremist, led a revolt against the Spanish Republican Government which had reduced the power of the Church since the days when it controlled everything. The Spanish Civil War was a prelude to the next World conflict, with Germany and Italy lining up behind Franco, while Britain, France, and Russia supported the republicans. Tragically for the Spanish people, Franco’s armies won, and he did for the Roman Catholic Church in Spain what Mussolini had done in Italy. It was given back its wealth and lands, received large annual payments from the state, and the education system was back in its control. Religious paraphernalia was everywhere and the inquisition returned. The Papal flag was flown by Franco as he overturned Spanish democracy and his flag was proudly flown at the Vatican. The Pope’s role in this victory over democracy had been crucial. He had appealed to Roman Catholics all over Europe to go to Spain and fight in this ‘Holy War’. When Hitler began his expansionism into Austria, the Roman Catholic bishops there told the people to be loyal to the Nazis and a swastika was flown from the tower of Vienna Cathedral. Hitler enjoyed Roman Catholic support also in his conquest of Czechoslovakia. Pope Pius XI and his successor, Pius XII, wanted more than anything for Germany to overthrow Communism in Russia. Little did they know that Germany had played a vital part in creating communism! The story of Vatican support for the fascists is quite disgraceful, although not surprising given its history; so is that"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"169 of the Brotherhood industrialists and bankers who were supporting both sides. By now there were Brotherhood organisations coordinating the elite bankers and industrial combines across the world. One was the Bank for International Settlements that was beyond democratic control. Among the financial backers of the Nazis were the German chemical giant I. G. Farben, among whose directors were Max and Paul Warburg who ran banks in both Germany and the United States. The Warburgs were instrumental in starting the American Federal Reserve Bank and you’ll recall that Max Warburg was mentioned earlier as a source of funds for Lenin and the communist revolution in Russia! The Bank of Manhattan was a Warburg bank, and one of its directors, H.A.Metz, was from I.G.Farben, which had been a cartel partner of the Rockefeller Corporation’s Standard Oil Company, before the war as part of the Brotherhood’s banking and industrial network. Standard Oil supplied the Nazis during the war through Switzerland, and Avery Rockefeller had set up a company which combined their interests with Schroeder, Hitler’s personal bank. C. E. Mitchell, a director of Farben’s American arm, was also a director of the Federal Reserve, and the network was now so tightly knit you could hardly see the join. Farben gave extra funding to Himmler’s SS, and so did the German subsidiaries of the American corporations, I.T.T and General Electric. General Motors supplied both sides in the war, as did the European subsidiaries of the US banks, with the blessing of headquarters. Ball bearings, which the allies were short of; were shipped to the Nazis via South America by the Vice-Chairman of the American War Productions Board. Farben ran the factories connected to the concentrations camps to take advantage of the, literally, slave labour they offered, and the same company produced the gas that killed the victims of Auschwitz and the hundreds of other extermination centres. I. G. Farben still continues to operate today under various names. * The Brotherhood network in Britain supported the Nazis - and still does - and the Bank of England helped Hitler. Its director, Montague Norman, who was a ‘Mr. Big’ of the world banking network, met in the Spring of 1934 with other British businessmen at the bank’s * The drug companies, A.G.

Farben offshoots."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"170 headquarters in Threadneedle Street, and it appears they agreed to give Hitler secret funding, while Norman tried to persuade the British government to remove their support for France and transfer it to Germany. Even after Hitler had begun his killing tour of Europe, the Bank of England released to him six million pounds of Czechoslovak reserves held in London after he had invaded that country. All through the war the Brotherhood companies and banks in Allied countries were covertly funding both sides, which included support for Mussolini when his regime got into financial difficulties. It made them a fortune, something that was increased a thousandfold by the need to rebuild a shattered world. It also maintained the yoke of suffering and ignorance on the population. The Bank of England was nationalised by the new Labour Government in 1946, but it still has a massive influence on Britain 5 economic policies and I expect it to start demanding more independence from government. Hitler ignored all agreements made by Germany in the Treaty of Versailles after their defeat in the First World War. He assembled a vast army, navy and air force, and the rest of Europe feared the worst. After Hitler’s invasion of Austria, the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, flew to meet him in Munich in 1938 and came home with his famous agreement signed by Hitler, which Chamberlain claimed would mean ‘peace in our times’. Chamberlain was a genuine man who only wanted peace for his people, but Hitler had other ideas. When Germany invaded Poland in 1939 Britain and France declared war. Poland was now again under foreign rule after a brief independence, during which the Roman Catholic majority had persecuted the Eastern orthodox Christians in their midst. After the war Poland was absorbed into the Soviet Union until that empire collapsed in 1991. The Poles then handed over their independence to the Roman Catholic Church which today, effectively, runs the country. If anyone thinks the Roman Catholic Church has really moved on, they should see how quickly it has taken control of Poland once the opportunity presented itself. Hitler captured France, Belgium and the Netherlands, but chose not to attack Britain when we were in disarray at home. Winston Churchill had replaced Chamberlain, but Britain was not prepared for war. Had Hitler attacked then he would almost certainly have captured the British Isles quite easily. Why did he not attack when"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"171 Britain was clearly there for the taking? Maybe it wasn’t part of the game plan? The evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk in the armada of little boats in 1940 was a marvellous achievement, but if the German commanders had wanted to stop it, they could have. Why didn’t they? Instead of invading Britain, Hitler turned his mind to Russia which suffered fantastic losses in the defence of their land, and again it was the courage and commitment of a manipulated people that weakened the German forces and delayed their plans. The conflict spread to North Africa where the Allies confronted German and Italian troops under Rommel. It was Rommel’s ultimate defeat at El Alamein, and the Soviets’ extraordinary defeat of the Germans in the East, which ended a series of German victories and the tide began to turn the flow the way of the Allies. But the big change came when the United States entered the war in 1941. She had already been supporting the Allies with supplies and arms when the Japanese attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This brought the US into the war - exactly as it was meant to. This was the Lusitania mark II. The story behind that Japanese attack goes back a long way. The Japanese, like the Chinese, are of the Mongol race. Both countries have a history of civil war and unrest. The Japanese main religion is Shintoism and they too were enamoured by secret societies. The most dominant one had a Black Dragon symbol. They believed their Emperor to be Divine, and themselves to be descended from the gods, a chosen people descended from extra-terrestrials. All efforts by Christian missionaries to convert them failed, and in the 17th century the behaviour of the missionaries towards them was so appalling that they closed their country to all Europeans for two hundred years. In the second half of the 19th century, steamships from the United States arrived and refused to be turned away. Japan was attacked by a combination of the Americans, British, Dutch, and French until they were forced to open their ports. The Japanese became a people transformed in the decades that followed. They used the weapons provided by the Christian world to attack and defeat China in 1894, and Russia in 1905. She also entered the First World War against Germany. Between 1937 and 1939 she took over most of China, which was in the midst of constant insurrection against the stream of emperors and presidential dictators thrust upon them. Modern China’s story is of diabolical exploitation by the colonial powers, with the British trying to get the Chinese addicted to the drug opium for purposes of trade"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"172 and control. In the run up to Pearl Harbor, the British and Americans had been trying to stop Japan overthrowing the Chinese Emperor Chiang Kai-shek, and the Japanese resented this. They were given every encouragement to enter the war, and I believe that Winston Churchill knew all about it, as did his fellow freemason, President Franklin D Roosevelt. Churchill would later say privately of this time that Roosevelt.... “Said he would wage war, but not declare it (and) that he would become more and more provocative everything was being done to force an ‘incident’ that could lead the United States into war In the US Senate in 1939, Senator Gerald P.Nye of North Dakota announced that he had seen a series of volumes called The Next War. One of them was entitled Propaganda In The Next War. He said the writer of that book was a Sidney Rogerson, whom he could not trace. But he knew that the editor-in-chief of the series was Captain Liddell Hart who was a writer and military authority in Europe with connections to the London Times. The work Propaganda In The Next War had, he said, included the following analysis of the background to World War I: “For some time the issue as to which side the United States would take hung in the balance, the final result was a credit to our British propaganda. There remain the Jews. It has been estimated that of the world Jew population of approximately fifteen million, no fewer than five million are in the United States; 25% of the inhabitants of New York are Jews. During the Great War we bought off this huge American Jewish public by the promise of the Jewish national home in Palestine, held by Ludendorf to be a master stroke of allied propaganda, as it enabled us not only to appeal to Jews in America, but to Jews in Germany as well.” The Americans entered the First World War in 1917, and on November 6th of that year came the famous Balfour Declaration, when the British Government announced the recognition of Palestine as a national homeland for the Jews. It is important to note that Lord Balfour was closely linked with the Round Table Group. The dreadful events in Israel in recent years are the result of Britain negotiating away Palestine to get the United States to enter the First World War and to further Brotherhood ambitions. But how could the American public be persuaded to support Britain in the next war,"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"173 which this propaganda report clearly knew was inevit able? “To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be much more difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite threat to America, a threat, moreover, which will have to be brought home by propaganda to every citizen, before the republic will again take arms in an external quarrel... “The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan were involved, and this might and probably would bring America in without further ado. At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious effect of our propagandists to achieve this, just as in the Great War they succeeded in embroiling the United States with Germany. “Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearly enunciate our belief in the democratic form of government, and our firm resolve to adhere to.... the old goddess of democracy routine.” The main themes of wars are known and planned in advance. It is clear from evidence that has emerged since the war that President Franklin D Roosevelt knew at least forty-eight hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor that the Japanese were going to strike. He did nothing to warn his sailors and the people of Hawaii, because he wanted the American public to be so outraged that they would agree to enter the war in Europe. That is exactly what happened, just as the prewar propagandists had planned. The method of goading the Japanese came from the Brotherhood’s Council on Foreign Relations, the Round Table creation. The Council’s War and Peace Studies Project sent a memo to Roosevelt suggesting that aid be sent to China, and that he strangle Japanese trade by freezing their US assets, imposing a trade embargo on Japan, and refusing them the use of the Panama Canal. This he did, and Roosevelt and the Brotherhood were rewarded with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt was a pawn of the Brotherhood in the form of the Council on Foreign Relations. Much of his cabinet came from there and his son-in-law, Curtis Dall, quoted in Jim Keith’s Casebook on Alternative Three, said: “For a long time I felt that (Roosevelt)... had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the USA. But he didn’t.

Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared ‘ammunition’ in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people - and thus paid off and retained his internationalist political support.” The same applied to Churchill and those who decided he would be Prime Minister, and the same goes on in both countries, and all the others, today. I am not saying that they are ‘bad’ people - just pawns. The war was now truly global with fronts in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East, as the Japanese occupied the Allied colonies like Malaya, Singapore, the Philippines, Borneo, Hong Kong and Burma. The men, women and children who were caught in those countries when the Japanese invaded were subjected to unbelievable torture and atrocities. But then it is no good one country being holier than another in its version of history. Every country on the planet has shown itself capable of crimes against humanity. The British authorities reeled back in horror at the concentration camps in Germany, but it was the British who started the idea with their camps created by Lord Kitchener, in which 26,000 prisoners died in South Africa during the Boer War. And the allies were fighting alongside the Russian regime who were running concentration camps for their own people and slaughtering millions in other ways. Every continent was involved in the war, and the soldiers of Australia and New Zealand once again supported the Allied cause. Even with the support of America and the other English speaking peoples, the fascists were defeated only through horrendous loss of life on both sides. With the fascist armies overcome in North Africa the push began northwards into Italy in 1943. The Fascist Grand Council restored King Victor Emmanuel as ruler, and Mussolini was forced to resign. The Italian Parliament was reconvened under the new Prime Minister, Marshall Pietro Badogho. He first told Hitler he would continue the fight, but then made a peace pact with the Allies. Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland with his mistress, but they were killed by Communist partisans and their corpses held up for ridicule and public display in Milan. The Germans tried to hold back the Allied advance through Italy, but in the end their defences were breached.

The war in Europe was over, but allies who had been united against a common enemy were about to become extremely hostile to each other in what passed for peace. With Germany on the retreat, the latter weeks of the war became a race for Berlin between the western armies and the Russians. Both wanted to be in the best possible negotiating position for the division of land when the conflict was over. The Russians would spread their Communist (state fascist) creed to form the Empire of the Soviet Union and encompass Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Rumania, Poland, and the eastern part of Germany. Under US influence a wall was built to divide Berlin between capitalist and communist and those in the East who tried to reach the West were shot by their own army. Families were divided by the whims of the Communist dictator, Joseph Stalin, and his underlings and successors who would now murder millions of their own people in this ‘workers’ paradise’. The defeat of Germany did not end the war entirely. Japan still held out and Roosevelt’s successor, Harry S.Truman, another freemason, gave the order to drop the atom bomb which had been developed during the war years. An arm of the Illuminati’s Round Table, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, New Jersey, gave vital support to those who were developing the bomb. One of its members was Robert Oppenheimer, the leading light in the creation of the bomb, and Albert Einstein also regularly used the Institute. It has long been a front for the advancement of Brotherhood science which the public has no idea about, but which is usually between 50 and 100 years ahead of ‘public’ science. The Japanese Emperor Hirohito surrendered after two atomic bombs were dropped by US planes on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, 1945.80,000 men, women and children were killed in Hiroshima on the fateful day that atomic warfare came to this planet (or rather returned to it), and others would die horribly from the effects of radiation poisoning. In all thirty-five million people were killed in the Second World War and hundreds of millions were wounded, tortured, and scarred for life mentally, physically and emotionally. And this horror was the result of a war that never should have been, and would never have been had the Brotherhood network not have caused it. Add to those figures those millions who died and suffered in the First World War,"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"176 and all the others and words are hard to speak. But such emotions do not trouble the Illuminati: “And how far-seeing were our learned elders in ancient times when they said that to attain a serious end it behoves not to stop at any means or to count the victims sacrificed for the sake of that end . . . . We have not counted the victims ofthe Goy cattle . . . . “(Protocol 15) Most of the main players in the Nazi regime, probably including Hitler, escaped. He and his lady Eva Braun did not die in the bunker, as history urges us to believe. At least some of them went to South America. From the views and evidence I have heard and seen, I believe that Hitler was flown out of Germany by the famous German aviator, Hans Bauer. He flew Nazi wealth and personnel out of Berlin, and Hitler would have had no trouble getting away to a quiet airfield, because when the Russians arrived in Berlin, they found behind the bookcase in Hitler’s room a secret passage leading to an underground tunnel with its own trolley railway line. The dental records of Hitler and the corpse said to be Hitler did not match and it is most likely to have been the body of his driver, Julius Schreck, a Hitler fanatic, who looked like him and acted as his ‘double’ on several occasions. A Russian statement in 1945 said: “No trace of the bodies of Hitler or Eva Braun has been discovered.... It is established that Hitler, by means of false testimony, sought to hide his traces. Irrefutable proof exists that a small plane left the Tiergarten at dawn on April 30th, flying in the direction of Hamburg. Three men and a woman are known to have been on board. It has also been established that a large submarine left Hamburg before the arrival of the British forces. Mysterious persons were on board the submarine, among them a woman.” What is without doubt is that the Nazi influence, far from disappearing at the end of the war, continues to flourish with the secret societies and is now beginning to surface again among the mind-controlled human fodder who support the far right movement. They are also very influential within the police, the military, and the intelligence services like the American Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. Indeed the CIA engaged Reinhart Gehlen, the head of Russian operations in the Nazi Secret Service, to build the CIA"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"177 network in Europe, and he used many former SS officers on his staff. The international police organisation, INTERPOL, has been headed by many former SS Officers. The Nazis and their ‘values’ play a big part in the running of the modern Brotherhood, and it is time the truth was told and the robots rebelled. History is clearly not what it appears to be, and yet the official version is being indoctrinated into generation after generation through the ‘education’ system and the Brotherhood-controlled media. “Among the members of these (Freemasonic) lodges will be almost all the agents of international and national police since their service is for us irreplacable in the respect that the police is in the position not only to use its own particular measures with the insubordiante (Those who challenge the Brotherhood), but also to screen our activities and provide pretexts for discontents etc.” (Protocol 15) There is another aspect to this story that needs to be highlighted. All the confficts that I have documented, and the thousands I have not, have had a disastrous affect on the Earth’s energy field which has to absorb the negative energy humanity generates. The scale of this struck me on a trip to France with my family in 1993 when we stayed in a house between Caen and Falaise in Normandy. Falaise is the birthplace of William the Conquerer. It was a lovely area, but you could feel something unpleasant in the atmosphere. I knew that the D-Day Landings had taken place on the coast a short drive away from where we were staying, but it was only when we were leaving for home that I realised we had been living near the scene of a bloody carnage in 1944. The Battle of the Falaise Gap was, in the words of Eisenhower: ‘One of the biggest slaughter fields a war sector ever knew’. More than 650,000 people were killed or wounded. When thought patterns are broadcast by people, they stay in that area until they are balanced by other patterns. The spirits of the dead are often still there, too. The confusion and pain of the experience can prevent them from getting back to their ‘home’ frequency. We call them ‘ghosts’ or ‘lost souls’. When you go to the scene of battles it can feel ‘eerie’. These are the thought patterns of fear, horror, aggression, and pain that were created by those involved. Sensitive people who go to such places can hear battles or see them happening. They are tuning into these thought waves. We could feel them in that area of Normandy. There was a very malevolent energy, because like"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"178 attracts like, and negative energy attracts negative energy. My son, Gareth, then eleven, would not go upstairs in the house alone and it was very unpleasant. There was a door in an attic which was held shut by a substantial catch, but every time my wife, Linda, passed that door it was open. She would close it tight only for the same to happen again. Then one night she was awake and she looked across at Gareth who was sleeping in our room, because he was so frightened. Hovering above him she saw a dark cloud of energy. She watched as the cloud swept across the room and out through the door. The next morning she told me the story and she didn’t know that I woke up that night and felt a very strange and unpleasant atmosphere. After the experience, the atmosphere in the house changed and the attic door never came open again. Gareth’s fear disappeared, too. If you imagine that I am talking of the effects on the energy field of one battle in one war, you can see why the negative imbalance has progressed so quickly across the planet. But equally it can be removed just as quickly if we change the way we think. We are involved in a spiritual struggle between harmony and disharmony. The Luciferic consciousness manipulates extra- terrestrials and human behaviour by firing thought patterns into their individual and collective consciousness. These patterns are designed to distort the mental and, especially, emotional levels of our being. This has the effect of closing down the flow of energies, knowledge, and enlightenment between higher and lower selves. This flow has further been affected since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution which has turned many humans into physical as well as mental robots, and caused severe mental and emotional stress. In some ways human consciousness has come a long way over the period covered in this book, but in others it has hardly progressed at all. We are now facing the Days of Decision when, on this dense physical level, we evolve and rebel or we perish. That is the choice that now faces us all."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"179 11 Big is Beautiful? The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 18th century with the invention of the steam engine, and within a hundred years this revolution would fill the skies with black smoke and pollution, rape the planet for fuels, and turn millions, eventually billions, into robots; mere extensions of a factory machine. The poor and the weak have always been exploited by the landowners or whoever had the financial and physical power of the day. But now it was to be done on a massive, ultimately global scale, as the Brotherhood spread its economic culture across the world. The people came in from the countryside, and filthy urban sprawls appeared around the mills and the factories. They worked long hours often for starvation wages, and the system I have termed ‘take, make, and throwaway’ had arrived. Its Pied Piper was the obsession with the pursuit of economic growth -producing more, consuming more, and throwing away more, every year. But actually playing the tune was the Brotherhood network of bankers and their front organisations, the so called ‘think tanks’. A new religion was born. It was called ‘science’. Christianity was still powerful, but its influence was now in terminal decline. Suddenly the scientist was God. This science created the machine age and all the potions and poisons that have taken human life, quite possibly, to the brink of non-existence. But as the 19th century passed to the 20th, this new culture and new God had hypnotised much of human consciousness. Science, or what passes for it, decided that life after physical death was a myth. Everything could be explained by the ‘logic’ of science. Basically we were all a cosmic accident, the product of the random interaction of chemicals, atoms, and the like. This gave Christianity some serious problems, but it gave the human race even more. Not least was the growing belief that life was pointless. The idea was that ‘life’s a bitch and then you die’."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"180 The lives people were being forced to endure in the blackened towns and cities appeared to confirm that this was the case. It was another drain on a human spirit already crushed by the robotic demands of the machine age. Christianity’s ability to stop the haemorrhage of support in the face of scientific ‘evidence’ was not helped by the obvious nonsense of its dogmatic, unyielding, claims for the Bible to be literally true. It was now beginning to reap the consequences of refusing to budge from the dogma decided at Nicaea and in the centuries that immediately followed. But as I said in a previous chapter, the view of life and Creation outlined in this book and others, was now suppressed not only by Christianity as it had been for nearly 2,000 years, but also by ‘science’. Christianity and ‘science’ may have appeared to be in conflict, but they had a mutual interest which was essential to the survival of both. That was to ensure that as few people as possible believed that consciousness was eternal in everyone, and that our consciousness reincarnates into countless physical bodies on its journey of evolution through experience. The acceptance of that by the population would mean goodbye to Christianity and most other religions, and goodbye to the whole basis of scientific ‘thinking’. One of the Brotherhood’s most effective tools is to make organisations dependent for their very survival on the suppression of knowledge. The result of this was a world created by the five physical senses which pandered only to those senses. God was dead and the idea of spirit was a primitive illusion. Materialism had arrived with a vengeance. Our culture was built by material senses for material senses. Such a process could not have created any other kind of world than the one we see today. The higher levels of humans were dismissed by ‘science’ as not even existing and the only high-profile alternative, Christianity and its religious soul-mates around the World, were leaking credibility with every passing year, thanks to the time-warp in which they are imprisoned. This left a spiritual vacuum which is only now being filled as an understanding of who we are begins to re-emerge in our consciousness. The material-cosmic- accident view so took over this new religion called science, that even when members of its own profession challenged this belief; they were ridiculed, outcast, or ignored. Just as the Brotherhood ensured that they would be. They don’t want some freethinking scientist to find out the truth and be able to prove it. Nearly every true scientist"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"181 who has taken human under standing forward has faced that kind of reaction and opposition. ‘Science’ became obsessed with the physical level and concentrated its mind on discovering the secrets and potential of the physical world, at the expense of seeking those higher levels where the answers really lie. Almost from the start, ‘science’ has been serving the system and the Brotherhood by helping to imprison the human race. In doing that, the new religion has merely followed the pattern of the old. The whole system was founded and underpinned at every turn by exploitation. Exploitation of the planet; of the human robots in the mines and factories; and of the people in what we now call the Third World. Most of these ‘under-developed’ countries were then under the occupation and control of Britain and other European Countries. Countries like Britain could not lose at this stage. It had the technology, primitive as it was, and it had the British Empire. It could take the natural ‘resources’ from the countries it controlled, turn those resources into products, and sell them back at a profit. This global exploitation by the strong at the expense of the weak would destroy the cultures of Third World countries and take away their self-sufficiency in food. This was vital for the exploitation to continue. When these countries eventually rebelled against physical occupation, Europe and the United States had to replace that with other forms of control. They achieved this by \\\\ replacing physical occupation with financial occupation. They made poorer countries dependent on the industrialised world for their food and finance. The American senator, Hubert Humphrey, put it like this: “I have heard that people may become dependent on us for food. I know that was not supposed to be good news. To me that was good news, because before people can do anything they have to eat. And if you are looking for a way to get people to lean on you and to be dependent on you, in terms of their cooperation with you, it seems to me that food dependency would be terrific.” Exactly. This motivation would lead to the famine and starvation of the 20th century. It was compounded by the exploitation of land for the maximum production of cash crops in ways that would destroy its fertility; and by the political and internal strife in these countries, often caused by the effects of poverty or the overthrowing of"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"182 regimes, openly or overtly, which did not suit the interests of the Brotherhood elite. They didn’t want Third World countries to make their own decisions - they wanted them dependent on the same Brotherhood bankers that ran the West. This goes on today with the United States the leading force in the ongoing effort to unseat any politician or group that threatens American or Brotherhood interests. Witness Nicaragua and the countless South American dictators imposed and empowered by the United States. I go into all this in some detail in my book, It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This. It is all part of the long term Brotherhood plan: “We are interested in the . . . . killing out of the Goyim. Our power is in the chronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker, because by all that this implies he is made the slave of our will, and he will not find in his own authorities either strength or energy to set against our will. Hunger creates the right of capital to rule the worker more surely than it was given to the aristocracy by the legal authority of kings.” (Protocol 3). The speed with which all this happened has been astonishing. When I was travelling through Arizona in 1993, I stopped at a little cafe at a place called Parker. On the wall was a poster depicting the members and exploits of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid whose bank-robbing activities were made famous by a film of the same name. What struck me most was that it all happened in this century. The United States went from horseback to space travel in less than 70 years, perhaps even less than that if some stories of covert space flights in the fifties are true. At the same time the USA has become the front line of self-destruction. Anyone who doesn’t believe that should go into any eating house on any street in America and see just how much of the Earth’s physical form is dumped into a rubbish bin every minute. Since the industrialisation and Christianisation of the United States, it has consumed more of the Earth’s ‘resources’ and created more pollution than any other society on the planet. And tragically that is the culture which has taken over the World in less than the blink of an eye in the lifespan of Mother Earth. If you take the Earth to be one year old, then under that time scale the Industrial Revolution has been with us for less than two seconds. In that fraction of time we have behaved in ways that now threaten the planet’s ability to be a home for human life. Every twenty-four"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"183 hours an area of tropical forest twenty-five miles by twenty is destroyed or degraded; deserts advance by a similar area; 200 million tonnes of top soil is lost through erosion; many and increasing numbers of species become extinct; and 100,000 people, nearly half of them children, die through hunger or hunger related disease. Every single day. But why should we be surprised at this? How could it be any other way when you have an economic system that depends for its survival, let alone its success, on taking, making, and throwing away more every year to worship at the Brotherhood altar of economic growth? It is the ultimate conveyor belt to global suicide. The stark truth is that if you need to consume more every year, the human and environmental effects are both enormous and eventually fatal. Either the Brotherhood elite are incredibly stupid, or they have lost control of their creation, or they have other motives for what they are doing to the planet. I suspect the latter. Here is a summary of why it has taken the human race little more than two hundred years to go from the dawn of the Industrial Revolution to the mess and mayhem we see today - and why it has so massively served Brotherhood interests: (1) If you have constantly to produce more and consume more, you soon pass the point where that can continue within your own borders. You have to sell abroad and export your culture. You have to change the way others live and impose your evolution upon them. You do this by making them dependent on you and by selling your culture through manipulative advertising. If you have an addictive product, like cigarettes, so much the better, because once people are hooked you have a captive market. And once you have other countries addicted to the pursuit of your culture, you have even more power to make them use their resources and land to supply you with what you need to supply them with finished products at a handsome profit. By now you have destroyed their self-sufficiency in food, and you can claim that the developed world is helping the underdeveloped world out of the goodness of its heart, and the success of its culture by ‘giving’ food to them when millions are starving, because they can no longer produce food for themselves. Even then you only respond with as little as you can get away with in situations that are either well publicised or suit your desire to make others do your will. As someone once said: ‘When you have got someone by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow’. They might just as easily have said ‘stomachs’. The need to expand production and sales each year"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"184 means that everyone has to compete with everyone else. For every winner there have to be losers, often dead ones. The one exception to that is the banking elite. They can’t lose. We talk of the desire for cooperation in the world, and yet the very foundation of the economic ethos is to turn person against person, family against family, town against town, country against country, and trading bloc against trading bloc in brutal competition, while the elite share the spoils between themselves. “In order to give the Goyim no time to think and take note, their minds must be diverted towards industry and trade. Thus, all the nations will be swallowed up in the pursuit of gain and in the race for it will not take note of their common foe. But, again, in order that freedom may once for all disintegrate and ruin the communities of the Goyim, we must put industry on a speculative basis; the result of this will be that what is withdrawn from the land by industry will slip through the hands and pass into speculation, that is, to our classes.” (Protocol 4). (2) It is vital that you also make your own population dependent for their food and existence on the same system. If they have alternatives, they cannot be forced to do your will or stand by a factory machine most of their waking hours. The effect of this is to diminish their spirit and grind down their resistance to any propaganda that you feed to them through a compliant and systemserving media. The need for expanding the system requires that your scientific’ research is geared to inventing new things that you can persuade people to buy; to finding cheaper ways of making those things through technology; and to inventing new weapons of mass destruction. As with video recorders, so with guided missiles. If you can constantly advance the technology of whatever you produce, people and countries will constantly ‘update’. In short, they will keep buying the same thing again and again as perfectly adequate ‘products are systematically made technologically ‘obsolete’. These twin aims of product and weapon advancement to serve the economic system is what science has largely been about. Serving humanity and seeking truth has been a strictly secondary motivation for the scientific Brotherhood-manipulated establishment. The weaponry is also important to protect the wealth of the powerful, and to increase that wealth when it becomes economically desirable for a war in which you can supply both sides."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"185 (3) This system is so obviously destructive and stupid that if you allowed people to be shown in its true nature, they would soon see the obvious. Christianity feared and vehemently opposed educa tion for the masses because of the possible consequences of people seeing that creed for the silliness which most of it is. But they need not have worried. The system had no intention of educating people, especially the young. It wishes to indoctrinate, not edu cate, and that is what it has done. ‘Education’ is there to turn out fodder for the system. Its aim is to persuade people to see things its way and reject any idea that there could possibly be an alternative. What could be better for the system than to take children away from their homes on most days during their formative years, and feed them whatever they need to believe to become the next generation of robots? It is quite happy to give Christianity a good mention up to a point because that is no threat to anything except itself and human understanding. As we have seen both the System and Christianity have a big stake in holding back human understanding, anyway. Further afield, where there are native peoples who have not been subjected to this economic mind control, you take away their forests, lands, and way of life either by force or through Christianisation. With their culture destroyed, they become dependent and often seek to escape from the nightmare through alcohol or drugs. Your control of the world is extended by environmental destruction. (4) The need to produce and sell more every year means that the point quickly arrives when people can no longer increase production by themselves. You build machines which turn out more products with fewer people. As production needs to constantly increase, the machines have to get bigger and require ever fewer people. Unemployment grows. The way the system responds to this is in the only way it knows how: by fiddling the unemployment figures to hide how bad things really are; by starting wars; and by increasing the number of things that people want by manipulating the symbols of human success so they all relate to posses sions. You need to make people dissatisfied with whatever they have and to seek happiness through the accumulation of material ‘things’. This however means that your production must follow the money because poor people can’t buy. Therefore production is increasingly geared to the wants of the well-off minority, and away from the needs of the poor majority. This leads to some people having ever y possession they could"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"186 possibly desire, while others sleep in cardboard boxes in the street. Look how the system has manipulated Christmas. Christianity recycled a pagan mid-winter festival quite erroneously into the birthday ofJesus and the system has recycled that into an orgy of consumption. We speak of having a ‘traditional Christmas’, when most of the traditions have only been here since the start of the Industrial Revolution. What should be a lovely time of rest, enjoyment, and a gathering together of friends and family, has become a nightmare for millions. Children are bombarded with television advertisements for expensive toys, and their parents often borrow money they cannot afford because they don’t want to disappointment them on Christmas Day. They either struggle through the next year paying off the debt, or they spend Christmas feeling guilty for not providing what their children have been conditioned to want. This exploitation of emotions becomes more desperate and explicit every year because the Christmas spending boom is now essential to the survival of many shops and factories. The difference between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ comes down to the number of pieces of paper they possess. This mostly has nothing whatsoever to do with their abilities or their desire to contribute to the well-being of society. You can be a financial ‘winner’ and earn lots of bits of paper by making some plastic claptrap that is no real use to anyone. But you can be a financial loser by dedicating your life to the care of others. What you sell is what matters, not what you contribute to humanity. As we have seen the easiest way to make money is to create it out of nothing. Values and desires become distorted by this and societies become sick and more divided. Another implication of this annual expansion is that, as production becomes more mechanised, the investment necessary to compete gets greater and the small fall by the wayside. Big becomes beautiful and life becomes ugly. The economic power gathers in fewer and fewer hands in line with the Brotherhood plan and the major corporations and banks call the shots far more than elected politicians. (5) The mopping up of unemployment by the expansion of ‘wants’ can only go on for so long. Through this century, and particularly since the sixties and seventies, the so-called ‘Third World’ has started to produce more finished products. The system that started with Britain exploiting its empire for ‘resources’ and selling them back the finished products has changed dramatically. The whole of Europe and"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"187 then the United States followed and expanded what Britain had started. In the second half of this century, the Far East, Asia, Africa, and South America, were sold the Industrial Dream, often by banks who wished to invest the money that was pouring in, especially from Arab countries after the Brotherhood-engineered oil price surge of the 1970s. The World has become awash with products looking for people to buy them. (6) At the same time there are fewer people with the money to buy those products. Once a large number of countries have the same ambition - to produce more and sell more and they pass the point where this can continue within their own borders, everyone has to compete with everyone else for sales all over the world. This becomes a battle to the economic and, for at least 100,000 people every day, the physical death. More automation is required to produce more products at a lower cost because everyone has to compete to find ways of making the same product cheaper. More automation means less employment, and less money in people’s pockets to buy the products the machines are making. The major manufacturers begin to transfer much of their production to Third World countries because the laws on exploitation there are even more lax than in the West, and you can pay people a fraction of the wages demanded in Europe and America. (7) As a result of all this, the system is now in desperate trouble and that is precisely what the banking elite want to justify their next step, a centralised world economy, based on a World Central Bank. While some unemployment is seen as good for the system because it helps to keep those employed subservient through fear of losing their job, there comes a stage where it is dangerous. This happens when the numbers without ajob, and with no prospect of getting one, reach uncontrollable proportions. The amount of money being produced by declining sales is no longer sufficient to pay the welfare benefits of those increasing numbers who are no longer employed and the social needs of the victims the system spits out when they are no longer any use to it. The system is so crazy that to survive it needs more and more people to buy each year, but fewer and fewer people to make what they buy. It cannot have both, but it needs both. People will be subservient only while they are indoctrinated to believe that the system will provide."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"188 When it becomes clear that it will not, people begin to rebel against that system. This rebellion becomes even more powerful as those without work and with no prospect of work, see their welfare benefits cut back by politicians overseeing declining industrial sales in the wake of all that I have described. The Illuminati want the people to respond violently to all this as we shall see, and response, the rebellion must be peaceful, if their plan is to be thwarted. (8) The main waste product of this system is human debris. When you force people to work in a soulless, mindless, system, this can have severe mental and emotional affects. Our hearts desire freedom, love, and joy. Our inner self wants to be positive, creative, and tap all the endless potential that we all have, and I mean all. But the system demands that we are little more than the extension of technology and expendable whenever technology can be created to replace us. To the system we are not people or spiritual beings, we are units of production and consumption. You will even note that we are now referred to by the stewards of the system, the politicians, economists, and industrialists, as ‘consumers’ because that is how it sees us. This system without a soul has created an explosion in other expressions of consumption such as alcohol and drugs. These are ways that people try to escape from the nightmare and the agony their inner selves are suffering. They may not even be aware that they are feeling like this at a deeper level. But it will still manifest in drugs and other forms of temporary escape from the realities of this mad world. The stress of the system’s demands, the constant competition, the fear, the imprisonment and suppression of the spirit, has become a conveyor belt for mental, emotional, and physical disease, or dis-ease as it really should be pronounced. The stress causes imbalances in the mental and emotional energy fields and these are passed on through the chakras to all levels of being, including the physical body. We have more and more illness caused by stress, and all the pollution and other dangers the system produces in its insatiable desire for expansion at all costs. Is it any wonder that you see defeat in so many faces. The system, science, and religion have combined to make billions tired of living, but scared of dying. Crime is another consequence. If you programme people to see their own success and that of others in terms of consumption and possessions, don’t hold up your hands in horror when those who cannot earn the money to consume and possess choose another way"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"189 of ‘succeeding’ in the system’s terms - theft, mugging, burglaries. In times of high unemployment more people are denied the ability to succeed through consumption or even feed their families, and this is why the crime figures soar. Also if the system treats human life as meaningless, worthless, fodder, without dignity or respect, don’t be surprised if that is how many others start to see their fellow human beings. Growing violence is evidence of this. Resentment at being rejected by the system leads to resentment against everything and everyone. In this state of mind some will mug an old lady for a few pounds or dollars without a thought for what they have done to her. Their motto will be: ‘the system has no respect for me, so why should I have any respect for anyone else? It’s everyone for themselves’. But hold on a second. If your agenda involves the introduction of an ever more authoritarian police force, military and legal system, what do you need more than anything to carry public opinion with you? More crime, the more violent and horrible the better. In a system in which the possession of pieces of paper is the only way you can enjoy food, shelter, and warmth, you are faced with increasing numbers of people made redundant by technology and recession who are hungry, homeless and cold. There are also those who are disabled, elderly and infirm, or unable to work for other reasons. These, too, are denied the means to earn pieces of paper. The System reacts to this in a variety of ways. In some countries it ignores such people and suppresses wholesale rebellion by strengthening the police force and the army and by making those in work fearful of speaking out against this cruelty and losing their job. Elsewhere, governments pay these victims of the system as little as they can get away with, though in a few more enlightened countries they are more generous. But all use the weapon of fear to control the population and prevent serious rebellion. Every year the System is faced with bigger bills for crime, policing, medical services, welfare benefits, and all the rest. This is an inevitable consequence of take, make and throwaway, and all that goes with it. And how does the system and its mind controlled politicians react to this? To say we must have a greater expansion of production and consumption to raise more money by creating more growth. This ‘policy’ spews out yet more victims and demands, yet more resources are spent on crime, police, medical services, and welfare benefits.

As Mark Twain said: ‘If you’re only tool is a hammer, all problems look like nails’. (9) The demands of the system and its de-humanisation of people has led to the exploitation of other life forms. I have heard it said that animal rights campaigners should think more about cruelty to people than animals. This misses the point. Cruelty is cruelty. Any society that will justify the appalling treatment of animals that goes on today will have no qualms about being cruel to people. Animals, like people, have become another commodity, another form of throughput. We perform experiments on them which make the worst excesses of the Nazis seem like kindness itsel£ We have the horrors of the slaughter houses and food factories. 500 million chickens in Britain are forced to live out their wretched lives standing on wire mess in tiny cages with hardly enough room to sit down. They are egg-throughput machines. Around 40 million little chicks are killed in Britain every year within hours of their birth for the ‘crime’ of being male. They are from a species genetically developed for egg laying. The males cannot lay eggs and so they cannot live. Every week in British slaughter houses we murder 8 million chickens, 300,000 pigs, 80,000 cattle, 500,000 turkeys, 50,000 rabbits, and 300,000 sheep in conditions of dreadful cruelty and barbarism. As the saying goes: If slaughterhouse walls were made of glass, we’d all be vegetarians. Only a human race de4inked from its true self and controlled by a consciousness that wishes to destroy our compassion and inner goodness would allow this to happen. There is a British Cabinet Minister and outspoken Christian dogmatist who has ridiculed vegetarians at every opportunity. “If God had wanted us to be vegetarians”, he said, “He would have given us three stomachs.” In reply you could say that if God had wanted us to talk such baloney He/She would not have given us a brain. (10) To hide the realities of the system and its corruption you need ‘Security Services and other organisations dedicated to secrecy. It is claimed that they are required to keep an eye on potential threats from other countries and terrorist groups and to safeguard national security, but as we have seen the main aim of governments and the secrecy services is to keep truth from their own people. This is vital if the system is going to survive. Truth to own people. This is vital if"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"191 the system is going to survive. Truth to the system is like garlic to a vampire. The security services spend more time spying on those peacefully challenging the status quo than they do on potential terrorists. They know and manipulate the terrorists, anyway, and indeed engage in terrorism themselves. All sorts of underhand manoeuvring goes on to stop any individual or group which they fear may be vehicles for effectively challenging the system. Frame-ups, phone taps, agents provocateur, even murder; all these methods are used by the state and the global Brotherhood and its representatives to stop those who present a threat to their continuing control. (11) Into all that I have said, another fundamental limitation on the system’s further expansion must be added. It is the most important factor of all. If you demand that every year you consume more, you dismantle the planet on which we all depend. Even the land is treated like a factory floor. It has been so exploited with chemicals to maximise short term production that its ability to go on producing is being reduced every year. If you had a machine that produced the essentials of human survival and it was the only machine of its kind that existed, what would people say if you took a sledgehammer to this machine and bashed it into tiny pieces? People would say you were bonkers, crazy, mad, many sandwiches short of a picnic. Well that is exactly what the human race is doing to the planet. Every year through this Industrial Revolution we have taken more ‘resources’ from the Earth and turned them into more pollution in the name of ‘progress.’ In doing this, the system has had to increase the number of products that are disposable and thrown away as soon as possible after purchase. Only in this way can you increase production. You can’t do it if you make things to last. This economic necessity under the rules of the system has given us the disposable cup, knife, fork, plate, razor, etc, and the ever-increasing amount of throwaway packaging. Something that is used once and thrown away is an orgasmic experience for the system; anything that is made to last as long as possible is potentially fatal. As I have said, the United States is on the front line of this suicide, but most of the world is involved also. We have created such a monster that the more successful it is in its own terms, the quicker it destroys the planet. But we still have politicians talking of the need to return to full employment. Under the rules of the present system, full employ ment of the traditional kind across the world would leave the planet a waste land. It is utter,"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"192 utter, insanity. It cannot go on and it will not go on. The consequences of this system of self-destruction have created a world in which 20 per cent of the population consume 80 per cent of the ‘resources’ every year; the other 80 per cent of humanity must go without their needs so the system can pander to greed. People throughout the world die from the diseases of too little, while elsewhere others die from the diseases of too much. It has produced a world full of conflict and division, one in which pain, suffering, exploitation, and war are essential to the systems survival. The Brotherhood which has created and orchestrated this system for its own ends, know it is a nonsense and after their planned coup on the human race, the first thing they will do is dismantle the system they have imposed: “You understand perfectly that economic arrangements of this kind, which have been suggested to the Goyim by us, cannot be carried on by us.” (Protocol 20.) They know the System’s stupid. It is supposed to be! But let me stress one point above all others. The enslaving consciousness and the pressures of this planet may make it more difficult to express our true selves, but it does not make it impossible. You only have to look around your own community and the world in general to see wonderful, loving, caring, and generous people. We don’t have to be robots or be controlled by the Brotherhood and the Luciferic thought patterns; we allow ourselves to be and we can stop doing so. We see enough in our own lives and elsewhere to know what is acceptable and what is not; we all have the opportunity to start to think for ourselves and live what we believe; we can all open our minds and re-connect with our higher consciousness. Millions are doing this today and many others have done so throughout history even through these traumatic centuries in the life of Planet Earth. It doesn’t have to be like this and we don’t have to be like this. Humanity is in nature good, not evil. We can express that goodness if we choose to. How strong is our will to resist the urgings of the Luciferic consciousness? How strong our desire to follow our own heart? The present transformation will bring - is bringing - change of an incomprehensible scale. The Luciferic control of human"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"193 consciousness is being removed and it will be both a time of turmoil and glorious opportunity. Clearly it is a transformation that has arrived not a moment too soon."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"194 12 The New World Order I can understand if some people are having trouble with the mental gymnastics demanded by this book. After all, your consciousness is being challenged to reject the accepted history of humankind, and to see through the smokescreen that much of it is. This is not always easy when you have been through the education (indoctrination) system, and the establishment version of past, present, and future are constantly fed to us through the media minute by minute. And in a world in which the ‘norm’ is to laugh at the idea of UFOs and extra-terrestrials, you are being presented with a view that suggests that far from not existing, ETs of both positive and negative intent have been a fundamental influence on human affairs. Perhaps most difficult of all to accept is that a brotherhood was set up thousands of years ago to initiate an elite into the spiritual ‘truths’, while twisting those truths enough to con the initiates into manipulating everyone else; and that today this same brotherhood has progressed to the point where it controls most of the world’s political, economic and secret service activity. From the perspective of life which the system encourages to us to believe, all of this appears to be simply ridiculous, quite outrageous and over the top. That Icke must be a candidate for the funny farm, eh? But that is exactly what you are supposed to think. Human beings are indoctrinated with such an inaccurate version of history and of reality that even if the suppression fails and truth comes out, it is so different from the indoctrinated version, that people just laugh and say it’s off the wall. What was it that Hitler said? “The bigger the lie, the more will believe it.” “If in regard to the external foe it is allowed and not considered immoral to keep the enemy in ignorance of plans to attack him by night or in superior numbers, then in what way can the same means in"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"195 regard to the worse foe, the destroyer of the structure of society and the commonweal (sic), be called immoral and not permissable?” (Illuminati Protocol 1). I am not suggesting that this brotherhood has mind-controlled its millions of members worldwide into knowingly dedicating their lives to the ‘Great Work of Ages’ called world domination. As I keep on stressing, the overwhelming majority will not know what they are a part 0£ It is as vital for the elite to keep them in the dark as it is for the mass of the population to be kept in ignorance. It couldn’t work if the membership knew the game plan because most would want nothing to do with it, and the brotherhood branches, like the freemasons, need an acceptable public face to hide behind. Their members below certain levels of initiation provide that with their dinner dances and their charity work. It’s the same with most of the others. Even lower levels of the secret societies are used for manipulation of local councils, courts, commerce and police officers, but most supporters of the Brotherhood are’very decent, kind, people. It is the elite we need to concern ourselves with and, at least in the great majority of cases, that does not even include politicians. They are pawns like everyone else. Those who work within the Brotherhood societies at the lower levels and haven’t realised the true agenda, no longer have the excuse of ignorance. The Illuminati Protocols make clear that the masonic lodges and the lower degrees peopled by what they call “Goy cattle” are merely there to provide the elite with “a show army in order to throw dust in the eyes of their fellows”. These unsuspecting, naive, masons should understand that they are expendable, too, in the eyes of the Illuminati. Everyone is. The elite’s obsession with world domination is their sole, driving, motivation. One Illuminati protocol points out that what it calls “Goy Masons” who know too much will be dealt with after the elite “come into their Kingdom”. Another says: “We execute masons in such wise (sic) that none save the brotherhood can ever have a suspicion of it, not even the victims themselves of our death sentence, they all die when required as if from a normal kind of illness. Knowing this, even the brotherhood in its turn dare not protest. While teaching Liberalism to the Goyim we at the same time keep our own people and our agents in a state of unquestioning submission.” (Protocol 15)."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"196 Even the Brotherhood elite has not been - and still is not today -in total control of everything. They have had some colossal failures I’m sure, and they have had periods through history when they have been less effective than at other times. But as each successive generation within the Brotherhood has passed on the initiations and indoctrination to the next one, its power to affect and decide the outcome of events has grown, particularly over the last two hundred years, as global communications and the world financial system has allowed enormous power to be held by the very few. The Brotherhood now pervades every area of our lives, and through the media which it also controls it can drip feed the population in ways it could never do before. Their plan to dominate the world, which goes under the name of the New World Order is reaching its conclusion - if we don’t wake up fast. In his period as President of the United States, George Bush even used those words New World Order to describe his vision of the future after the Gulf War. The Brotherhood elite which includes the Rothschild and Rockefeller empires now have six main front organisations for their covert activities. They are the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and the United Nations. All of these came directly, or indirectly, from the Round Table secret society set up by the freemason, Cecil Rhodes, and the Round Table still stands at the centre of this empire of control. Around that symbolic table sit the few who direct the world’s political and economic affairs. This empire is, in effect, the World Government in waiting, waiting that is, to become the official one. The aptly named Harold Pratt House at 58 East 68th Street in New York is the headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations. It was started with Rockefeller money in 1921. We have seen how this ‘think tank’ controlled events during the Second World War and it has continued to do so. Appointees from the CFR have been numerous and prominent within successive United States administrations, and the foreign and domestic policy of a supposedly free and democratic nation is controlled by this non-elected Brotherhood front group. If they direct US foreign policy, of course, they do so for the world. The CFR has affiliated organisations right across the US. It is the American arm of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, which is also known as ‘Chatham House’. This was set up in 1920 by “former delegates to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919”, - and these two ‘think tanks’ working in concert are the reason for the so-called ‘special"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"197 relation ship’ between Britain and the USA, and was responsible also for manipulating the Americans into the Second World War. The Institute* is obviously very influential in the foreign policy of the United Kingdom, and other countries have similar organisations under its influence. The Trilateral Commission was launched by David Rockefeller, the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank and head of the Rockefeller family empire. It was made public in 1973, but almost certainly existed in secret in 1920. The Commission consists of invited financiers, industrialists, media moguls, union leaders, and politicians from North America, Western Europe and Japan, and its aim is to control the course of international events, in order to protect and expand the interests of the elite in those three areas of the world. The symbolism of the triangle should be noted. It is a major brotherhood symbol. Within three years of going public it had achieved its ambition of installing the first TnLateralist president in the White House, Jimmy Carter, and his ‘National Security Adviser’ was Zbigniew Brzezinski, the commission’s first director and a leading inspiration behind its formation. Carter filled his administration with Trilateralists, among them his Vice-President, Walter Mondale, and Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance. The Bilderberg Group is another forum for Europe’s and America’s leading politicians, financiers, industrialists, media executives, and military leaders to discuss the course of human affairs. The Rothschilds and Rockefellers are the power behind the Bilderberg Group, which is the European and NATO connection within the Brotherhood empire. The Bilderberg meetings were started, yet again with Rockefeller and Rothschild money, by Prince Bernhard of the House of Orange in the Netherlands. The name Bilderberg comes from the hotel in the Netherlands where the group first met in 1954, though the existence of the group was denied for many years. Some researchers claim that Prince Bernhard was a member of the SS before the war and employee of I. G. Farben. After marrying into the House of Orange he became chairman of Shell Oil. He chaired the meetings until 1976 when he was forced to resign in a corruption scandal. Bilderberg meetings are held in strict secrecy, and only * Others attending included Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands, Queen Sophia of Spain, the owner of the Washington Post) the chairman of Ruper Murdoch’s News International, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, and a stream of prime ministers, politicians, bankers and industrialists."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"198 if you know an insider can you find out anything of their discussions. Lord Carrington, the former British cabinet minister and Secretary- General of NATO, is a prominent Bilberger, and became chairman in 1991. He is also a president of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. He works closely with the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, and with Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State. Kissinger is a Bilberger, a Trilateralist and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Lord Carrington was a founding board member of Kissinger Associates. Both are also on the board of the Hollinger Corporation (chairman Conrad Black, a Bilberger and owner of the London Daily Telegraph and theJerusalem Post. The Club of Rome is another ‘think tank’ organisation which claims to be developing a strategy for the survival of the planet and it, too, supports the idea of centralised planning and world government. Finally, there is the United Nations which is based in New York on land given by the Rockefellers. The plan for the UN was hatched during the last War by a secret steering committee of the Council on Foreign Relations. The UN was sold to the world under the cloak of pursuing peace among nations. Unlike its predecessor, the League of Nations, this one was going to stick and serve the Brotherhood. If one world war wouldn’t persuade governments to do as the elite required, give them another one; that did it. For United Nations read United States, and for USA and UN read New World Order. The Round Table and its subsidiaries control the United Nations. It was their creation and on all decisions that matter they call the shots. Out of this has come the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and the ground is now being prepared for a world army under UN (Brotherhood) control. NATO is already run by the Brotherhood. Conflicts are being triggered and inflamed across the globe to soften up public opinion to accept this as the only way to deal with the gathering violence. The more horrendous the pictures the media broadcast from the world trouble spots, the better it is for those who want a centrally-controlled world army. The UN Secretary General Dr. Boutros Ghali has already called for a permanent, heavily armed, UN force to be in situ by 1995. At a meeting of the Bilderberg Group at Baden Baden, Germany, m 1991, Henry Kissinger, is reported in Spotlight to have said: “A UN army must be able to act immediately, without the delays involved in each country making its own decisions on whether to participate based on par ochial considerations”."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"199 Governments don’t run the world the Brotherhood does. You can’t even run for the presidential nomination within your own party in America without enormous sums of money behind you, and without massive financial backing you have got no chance of running for the presidency itself. Once you have accepted that, there are favours to be paid off; and if you are not willing to play the game, you won’t be supported by the financiers anyway. Politicians are not usually privy to the whole brotherhood plot, even if they are members. They are only told what they need to know, and those who are invited to attend the Bilderberg meetings are there to be fed the brotherhood line of the best way to run the world. It is the Bilderberg Group’s permanent executive that runs the show, as it is with these other front organisations. One of those invited to the Baden Baden meeting of the Bilderbergers in 1991, incidentally, was the then governor of Arkansas, one Bill Clinton, who went on to become President. He would not have become President unless the elite wanted him to. The aim of the Illuminati is the introduction of a world government to which every continent would be subordinate. It would dictate foreign policy and control the world army. Underpinning everything would be a world central bank based on the lines of the national central banks of today, and there would be one currency controlled entirely by them. It also wishes to go further and turn the people of the planet literally into robots in ways that I will highlight shortly. If you look at the world today you can see how nations are already losing the power to make decisions to giant trading blocs like the European Community and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and in Europe the move is towards one currency and one European Central Bank. The pieces are being moved around the board in preparation for the ‘sting’. It is revealing to note, also, how so many politicians who oppose this loss of national sovereignty suddenly find themselves discredited and have their power removed. Spotlight, the investigative Washington DC paper, reported in May 1989 that the Bilderberg meeting that month on La Toya Island, off Spain, had decided that Margaret Thatcher would be removed as British Prime Minister, because of her “refusal to yield British sovereignty to the European Superstate that is to emerge after 1992”. That is exactly what happened when she was removed while in office by her own side, the British Conservative Party in 1990. It was a Brotherhood coup, nothing less, to ease the way to a United States of Europe. The latest GATT Agreement which opens more borders to"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"200 ‘free’ world trade is another creation of the Brotherhood elite to destroy a country’s ability to make its own economic decisions. The game plan is this. The Brotherhood, manipulated by its Illuminati elite, has been working to ceate conflict across the world on all levels. This is going into overdrive now. They are also undermining the world economy, which they control, to destroy what remains of the confidence the population has in politicians and governments. The Brotherhood has ensured that people of limited ability, intellect and vision - puppets - have reached the top in politics, and this has had two main effects. It has made sure they were easy to manipulate by the Brotherhood ‘advisors’ behind the scenes, and their obvious lack of ability has helped to remove the credibility still further of politics and politicians. This is exactly what the plans has always been in preparations for the economic collapse they will engineer. “The hatred (of the present order) will be further magnified by the effects of an economic crisis which will stop the dealings on the exchanges and bring industry to a standstill. We shall create by all subterranean methods open to us a universal economic crisis whereby we shall throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers simultaneously. These mobs will rush delightedly to shed the blood of those whom, in the simplicity of their ignorance, they have envied from their cradles, and whose property they will then be able to loot. Ours they will not touch, because the moment of attack will be known to us and we shall take measures to protect our own.” (Illuminati Protocol 3). This is the culmination of the long term plan to create dependence through the ‘Welfare State’. First they removed the independence of people by making them dependent on working for the military- industrial system. Then they squeezed the number of jobs and made more and more people dependent on so-called handouts, while taking away all alternatives of a self-reliant lifestyle that was not dependent on the Brotherhood economic system. Now they are using that manufactured dependence to further manipulate. They are reducing social security payments and will seek to force people to work for the state in return for a pittance called ‘unemployment benefit’ or whatever. What they want to create is an underclass of bitterness which will trigger civil war between the haves and have nots. They"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"201 also wish to crush the human spirit and make it too weary to resist the New World Order, and even to welcome it as their saviour. When things have got so bad, in terms of the economy, wars, and disease, and the world is in utter chaos, along will come the Brotherhood with its mask of compassion and benevolence and promise to put everything right. What they won’t say is that the ills they will pledge themselves to remove are the very ills they have orchestrated to programme the human mind. They will blame it all on the politicians they have controlled and the system they have created. They will blame it all on the politicians they have controlled and the system they have created the secret societies which they are, themselves, committed to destroy should they get to power so they cannot be used to covertly undermine them! “It is from us that the all-engulfing terror proceeds. We have in our service persons of all opinions, of all doctrines, restorating monarchists, demagogues, socialists, communists, and utopian dreamers of every kind. We have harnessed them all to the task: each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established forms of order. By these acts all states are in torture; they exhort to tranquility, are ready to sacrifice everything for peace: but we will not give them peace until they openly acknowledge our international super-government, and with submissiveness. . . To produce the possibility of the expression of such wishes by all the nations it is indispensible to trouble in all countries the people’s relations with their governments so as to utterly exhaust humanity with dissension, hatred, struggle, envy and even by the use of torture, by starvation, by the inoculation of diseases [Aids], by want, so that the Goyim sees no other issue than to take refuge in our complete sovereignty in money and in all else. But if we give the nations of the world a breathing space the moment we long for is hardly likely ever to arrive . . . .

Wake Up. Trades Union and other ‘workers organisations’, political and non-political, are being used to bring about the fascist World Government, mostly without realising it: “We shall raise the rate of wages which, however, will not bring any advantage to the workers, for, at the same time, we shall produce a rise in prices of the first necessities of life.....we shall further undermine artfully and deeply sources of production, by accustoming the workers to anarchy and to drunkeness and side by side therewith taking all measure to extirpate from the face of the earth all the educated forces of the goyim. In order that the true meaning of things may not strike the goyim before the proper time we shall mask it under an alleged ardent desire to serve the working classes and the great principles of the political economy about which our economic theories are carrying on an energetic propaganda.” (Protocol 7). Behind this attempt to complete the ‘Great Work of Ages’ are some of the same mystical teachings of the infiltrated Brotherhood and its Mystery schools which go back at least as far as ancient Egypt and Babylon. On one level the New World Order would appear to include the crowning of a ‘Messiah’, the Second Coming of a World King in around the year 2,000. The crowning is planned to take place in a rebuilt Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, which would replace the Moslem Mosque currently on that site. This new Messiah would seem to be someone (at least in the Brotherhood’s misguided mind) claiming a bloodline back to King David via Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and their offspring. This is what the Knights Templars were dedicated to doing (and still are in the guise of the Freemasons) and the Priory of Sion still exists and continues to pursue this bizarre ambition, along with its long held goal of a “United States of Europe”. Another aim of the New World Order is for one World Church - its own - based on the beliefs of the Templars. Some researchers believe that the ‘World King’ is part of a bloodline going back to the last Roman Emperor. Like I say, it doesn’t matter if you believe this nonsense followed by the Brotherhood, as long as they believe it, we are all"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"203 affected. The Illuminati are not stupid, but they are very strange people. According to Sumer tablets and freemasonic legend, there was a supernova or massive explosion in the heavens in the ancient period. It has been claimed that the grand gallery in the Great Pyramid at Giza is focused on the area of the Southern sky where the supernova would have been seen in the triangle of stars called Zeta Puppis, Gamma Velorum, and Lambda Velorum. Some scientists have identified pulses which they believe to be radio waves caused by a star which blew apart around 4,OOOBC. The Sumerian star catalogue, which has been shown to be very accurate, predicted that the blazing star would be seen again on Earth in 6,000 years - around now. Perhaps the Brotherhood intends to use what it believes to be the return of that exploding star to usher in its New World Order and the world king. If it can cause so much mayhem in the world before then, people will be only too willing to believe in some Second Coming to bring ‘peace’ to humanity -especially if this is combined with amazing sights in the sky. I don’t know what goes on the minds of the Brotherhood, because the reality of life has been so muddled in their consciousness by the Luciferic forces and the indoctrination of the ages, that goodness knows what they believe or will seek to achieve. The overall ambition, however, remains the same. To imprison the human race, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically. Investigators of the New World Order and brotherhood history come from all shades of belief. Among them are Christian fanatics and those, like me, who think that religion is a curse on the world. There are some who have got interested in the subject from the economic point of view, while others have come into this area of investigation via science, the New Age, the security services, UFO groups, etc. There are some I would not choose to spend an evening with and others who are calling for the Illuminati to be hung, which is, to say the least, hardly my own approach! In short, the investigators come from many belief systems and this makes even more compelling the enormous area of agreement between them on the main themes of the conspiracy I am outlining. I emphasise the need to keep our eyes on the themes and not get too bogged down with every detail, because there is a great deal of misinformation flying around. You have to be aware of the double- bluff - the leaking of information by the Brotherhood to take researchers off the trail. The Brotherhood intelligence network has infiltrated many New Age, UFO, and investigative groups and you"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"204 have to be careful not to believe everything claimed by apparent ‘opponents’ of the New World Order. Remember how the Brotherhood works. This whole area is teeming with ‘ex CIA’ men claiming to have seen the light and anxious to tell the public the truth. In some cases they might be genuine, in many they will not. The most effective form of disinformation is when truth is mixed with fiction which can easily be shown to be inaccurate. This way you achieve two things. You discredit the investigators by proving that some of their claims are wrong, and you discredit in the public mind the other information they have put out which is true. It is vital that when some information genuinely released by writers and researchers is proved to be false that people don’t at the same time reject everything else they are saying. That is what you are meant to do. And, anyway, why if the authorities have nothing to hide are they putting out disinformation in the first place? The whole idea is to confuse and this not only applies to New World Order investigators, but also the public in general. “In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into a state of bewilderment by giving expression from all sides to so many contradictory opinions and for such length of time as will suffice to make the Goyim lose their heads in the labyrinth and come to see that the best thing is to have no opinion of any kind in matters political.” (Protocol 5). Whenever I hear someone say “I never discuss politics or religion” as if that is a virtue, I feel like screaming. Crucial to the Illuminati cover-up, the publishing of disinformation and the discrediting of investigators like myself, is the press and the media. I will take more of this in a later chapter, but suffice to say now that the world media is almost totally under Brotherhood control and where they don’t actually run the publication, they control the ‘information’ that it receives. Most journalists (and there are some honorable exceptions) are in a mental prison, again most of them without realising it. I have met many who clearly think they are street-wise about the world when if they only opened their eyes they would see that they are little more than copy typists for the manipulators. They largely ‘investigate’ irrelevances or subjects which suit the Brotherhood’s desired plan. What the public really need to know is never addressed. I heard Harold Evans, the former editor of the London Times and Sunday Times, talking on the radio of the appalling way the media"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"205 tycoon Rupert Murdoch, his former boss, runs his vast world newspaper and broadcasting empire to suit his own commercial and political interests (and who else’s?). Evans described how Margaret Thatcher in her years as British Prime Minister was “Murdoch’s poodle” who did as she was told. I found it particularly interesting in the light of this book, that Evans also made the point that while American journalists were committing endless time, money, and energy into investigating the bedroom habits of Bill Clinton, and the financial speculation of his wife, the terrible effect of the Federal Reserve Board on the US economy went unchallenged. But then, after what this book has revealed, that is no longer a surprise, is it? Most so called professionaljournalists are irrelevant to real information gathering and communication. That is being done by researchers who have the courage to search for truth and the magazines now springing into life which are prepared to print it. John Swainton, Editor of the prestigious New York Times in the / 4860s and 70s in a retirement speech to his staff said: “There is no such thing as a free press. You know it and I know it. There’s not one of you who would dare to write his honest opinions. The business of a journalist is to destroy truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the fret of Mammon, and to sell himself his country and his race for his daily bread. We are tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are jumping jacks; they pull the strings, we dance; our talents, our possibilities and our lives are the property of these men. We are intellectual prostitutes.“* The main difference between researchers of the New World Order is over the existence or not of extra-terrestrials in all this. I have made it clear in the book that I do believe ETs exist and that they seeded the human form as we know it. I feel their direct involvement, on Earth at least, dramatically reduced after Atlantis, but I feel they have continued to have an effect, positive and negative, on human evolution. I think they have worked through human consciousness and when you see in due course the mind controlling techniques available to the Illuminati’s human scientists and manipulators, you * Quoted by Dana Baker in her article on “Media Suppression” in Profile Magazine."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"206 will appreciate that anything is possible for extra-terrestrials who are far in advance of us technologically and in their mind-controlling potential. It is important to remember also, given the themes I have been suggesting through human history, that the ETs have had this knowledge and potential throughout the period covered by this book. It could well be that negative ETs (by far the minority) have control of the minds of the Illuminati, and I believe that to be the case. The Illuminati are victims, too, and mind-controlled to mind control everyone else since ancient times. That is not to say that I accept all the UFO stories. There is a great deal of disinformation being put about to confuse and divert and I feel that some claims about UFOs are being used to cover up Brotherhood activities, for reasons I will explain later. But for the moment, let us look at the evidence for the direct involvement of ETs on Earth today. Human history is littered with stories of strange lights and ‘gods’ in the sky, unidentified flying objects, and the appearance of ET-type figures. Of course not all will be genuine, and there were probably non-UFO explanations for most of them, but it is silly just to write them all off as some people do. The reports increased in modern times from the early 1940s and a number of incidents have been reported of extra-terrestrial bodies being found. The most famous is known as the Roswell incident which has been documented by many researchers, including Tim Good in his books on the subject. On July 2nd 1947, the story goes, at least one spacecraft crashed during a storm in the New Mexico desert near a place called Corona, seventy-five miles North-west of Roswell. The crash left a trail of debris a mile long and a hundred yards wide. A ranch hand, ‘Mac’ Brazel, picked up some of the remains, strange pieces of metal which were incredibly light and strong which had written upon them geometrical symbols and hieroglyphics. The ranch hand didn’t tell the authorities about this find for several days and when he did some personnel from the Roswell army-air base arrived to investigate. After they reported to the base commander he authorised a press release announcing they had found a flying saucer. This was printed in the local papers and one report said: “The office of the 509th bombardment group at Roswell Army Air Field announced at Noon today that the field was in possession of a flying saucer.”"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"207 Suddenly the higher levels of the military arrived on the scene and the cover-up began. They withdrew the press release and launched a weather balloon which they immediately caused to crash. They made this available for press pictures claiming that the balloon and not a flying saucer had been found. Meanwhile, in another area of the crash site, a civil engineer working on an irrigation project and a group of archeologists found four extra-terrestrials. Three were dead and one was still alive, so the story says. They were described as three to four feet tall wearing very tight, space suit-type clothing, but with no cover on the heads or hands. The military closed off the entire area and those who saw either the crashed craft or the bodies were threatened by the authorities and warned of the consequences if they revealed what they had seen. The local radio station, KGFL New Mexico, was visited by the military after recording an interview with a witness and told that if they wanted to be on the air twenty-four hours later they should hand over the interview and forget it ever happened. This they did. A local mortician who accidentally looked into an operating theatre and saw one of the extra-terrestrial bodies was told that he would be ‘dead bones’ if he opened his mouth. A soldier, Sergeant Melvin E Brown, was told to guard something without being told what it was. When he investigated he found extra- terrestrial bodies. Brown told his family very little, but his daughters remember him saying that the bodies he saw had larger heads than humans, and no hair. They looked yellowy in colour and their slanted eyes reminded him of the Chinese. It could have been this race that ‘seeded’ the Chinese, perhaps. The extra-terrestrial races that visit the Earth are many and diverse, and therefore, so are the races of the Earth which they originally created, and possibly continue to affect genetically. Brown was terrified to reveal anything more of what he knew to his dying day, but now people are beginning to speak out and describe their experiences. More than two hundred people witnessed something of this story. There has been much speculation about the events that followed the discovery of these craft and their occupants in a number of incidents during the 1940s and ‘SOs. Many investigators and insider informants have said that an ET was found alive in another incident near Roswell in 1949. He was given the name ‘EBE’ or Extraterrestrial Biological Entity, and lived until 1952. His metabolism worked much like a plant, with nourishment absorbed through the skin. EBE, and other ETs found alive over the years,"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"208 passed on some astonishing information to the Americans, it is said, which transformed their understanding of Creation and the origins of the human race as we know it. What they were told, according to some writers, supports the themes of ET activity and ‘seeding’ of the human form by ETs, according to some writers. A few researchers, especially the former member of American Naval Intelligence, Bill Cooper, go much further than most and claim a secret conspiracy between the Illuminati and a race of negative ETs which, he believes, started in the 1950s. He highlights this in his book, Behold a Pale Horse. In summary, he suggests the following hypothesis based on what he saw in Naval Intelligence and what he has been told by his ‘contacts’ since then. To save putting the next few paragraphs in quotes or adding in endless “Cooper says” or “Cooper claims”, please keep in mind throughout this little section that the following is what Bill Cooper is saying, and not me. Cooper reckons that following the information passed on by the EBE, Project Sign, later called Project Grudge, was launched to investigate what was going on. Another project, called Blue Book, was formed to issue disinformation and hamper outside investigations. President Truman formed the National Security Agency in 1952 by secret executive order with the task of starting a communication with the ETs. The National Security Agency (NSA) is not subject to any laws in the United States, which do not specifically mention it by name. The work of the NSA is about as secret as you can get, and it is by far the most important arm of the Amencar.’ intelligence agencies. It attracts most of the funding. Truman told the highest levels of the allies and the Soviet Union of what had been found. The NSA’s main job was to find ways of communicating with the ETs and establish the background to their activity. This was done though a special project code named SIGMA. Dwight D Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in World War II, became President in 1953 thanks to encouragement and support from the Rockefellers. He was another president from the Council on Foreign Relations. More spacecraft and extra-terrestrials were found and he engaged his friend and CFR member Nelson Rockefeller to help with the ET problem. Rockefeller used the opportunity to restructure the administration of government to make it easier to manipulate, after he was made chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Governmental Organisation. Nelson Rockefeller was a Republican who was elected governor of"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"209 New York State four times and rose to the position of Assistant Secretary of State under Roosevelt, even though that was a Democratic administration. He would later become Vice-President after twice losing to Richard Nixon in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination. Communications were eventually made with a race of ETs who claimed to come from a planet linked to the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. The communications were made thanks to the work of Project SIGMA. The ETs took a high orbit over the Equator and the Americans, says Cooper, used computer binary language to set up a landing and face to face meeting. This happened in 1954 when a group of ETs landed at the Holloman Air Force base and later at the Edwards Air Force Base where they met Eisenhower himsel£ Both the landings and the meeting were filmed, apparently, and somewhere the film still exists. The claims about this meeting are supported by other sources. It is known that Eisenhower was on vacation in Palm Springs, playing golf at this time. He was staying with his friend Paul Roy Helms at the Smoke Tree Ranch, but on the relevant day 20th February 1954, he ‘went missing’ for four hours. This would have given him plenty of time to get to the Edwards Air Force Base (then called Muroc), to attend the meeting. The official explanation for his disappearance was that he had to visit a local dentist after losing a cap on his tooth while eating a chicken leg. No proof of this has ever been offered. The meeting with the ETs led to an agreement. They would not interfere with human affairs so long as their presence was kept a secret, and they were allowed to abduct a certain number of people for research purposes because they had major problems on their own planet, particularly with reproduction. The ETs said the humans would have no memory of the abductions, because of their ability to programme the mind. The Americans agreed to a limited number of abductions on the understanding that the humans would not be harmed, and in return the ETs said they would pass on highly advanced technology and the knowledge of how to time-travel. It was agreed that the ETs would not work with any other nation, and that there would be an exchange of personnel and ‘ambassadors’. Underground bases would be established in the United States for the extra-terrestrials and for the exchange of technology. These were to be under Indian Reservations in the area known as Four Corners in Utah, and in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and a location known"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"210 as Area 51 or ‘Dreamland’ near Groom Lake in Nevada. The ETs began to pass on their technology here in an area called S-4, code named the Dark Side of the Moon. Project Redlight was created to begin the experimental flights of the ET technology now in US hands, and various projects were begun to maintain total secrecy of what was happening. Project Snowbird had the task of rubbishing any reports of’UFOs’ over the United States. One way they did this was to show the press what experiments they were doing with conventional technology which they used as a way to explain some UFO sightings. In fact they had technology to overcome gravity, and they had their own space craft in the 1950s which, by comparison, make today’s Space Shuttle look like the technological equivalent of a London taxi. The Space Shuttle, like the technology used in the ‘first’ Moon landing, is a con, a cover for what is really going on. Cooper says the underground facilities were paid for with a secret fund administered by the Military Office in the White House. This money was laundered many times before it reached its destination, to mask the origin and purpose. Eisenhower was the last president to know what was really going on, and later presidents who asked about the fund were told it was to build underground shelters for the government in times of war. President Lyndon Johnson used it to build a cinema and a road on his ranch, because he had no idea of its true purpose. There are now, Bill Cooper says, underground sites for the military and ETs all over the States. Most presidents after Eisenhower have been told only that extra-terrestrials with problems on their own planet want to settle here and are handing over incredible gifts of technology in return. Some have known nothing. Eisenhower set up a permanent committee to supervise all covert operations relating to the ETs. It was called the Majesty 12 (MJ-12) and consisted, according to Cooper’s research, of Nelson Rockefeller, CIA Director Allen Welsh Dulles, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Secretary of Defence Charles E Wilson, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Arthur W Radford, the FBI Director J Edgar Hoover, and six men from the executive committee of the Council on Foreign Relations. These were known as the ‘Wise Men’ and they were all members of a secret society called the Jason Society or the Jason Scholars. These recruited members from the Skull and Bones and the Scroll and Key secret societies at the Harvard and Yale Universities. George Bush was a member of the Skull and Bones and would later join the Council on Foreign"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"211 Relations and become head of the CIA. MJ-12 has had many changes of name over the years, it would appear. Under Eisenhower and Kennedy it was called the Special Group; under Johnson it was the 303 Committee; under Nixon, Ford, and Carter it became the 40 Committee, and under Reagan it was known as P1-40. More recently there has been an attempt to promote disinformation with a ‘briefing paper’ which mentions an organisation called Majestic 12. Several presidents, including Carter and Reagan, have talked of seeing UFOs before they took office. Carter said during his election campaign that, if elected, he would reveal every piece of information available about them to the public and the scientists. Perhaps he intended to, but he never did. Eisenhower soon realised that the ETs were not keeping to their agreement. Mutilated animals and people were being found across the country and many abductees were clearly not being returned to the Earth. The Americans now found out that the ETs were interacting with the Soviet Union and that, Cooper says, ....... they had been manipulating humanity through the secret societies, mysticism and religion for a very long time. They had control of the mind of Adolf Hitler and all of those ‘evil’ people who have made humanity suffer so much. Eisenhower established a committee to investigate what was happening. Cooper’s sources say it consisted of members of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Jason Society. Zbigniew Brzezinski, the instigator and first director of the Trilateral Commission, was also the director of this new committee for the first eighteen months with Henry Kissinger taking over from him. This group was called Quantico II after the marine base at Quantico, Virginia, where its later meetings took place. Nelson Rockefeller had a retreat built in Maryland which could only be reached by air, which he did specifically for meetings of this group and MJ 12. This location was code named the Country Club. In the end they decided that the only way to proceed was to continue to seek friendly relations with the ETs. The working relationship has continued ever since although not without conflict and disagreements. It could be that it is not all dense physical interaction, perhaps. It may be that there is psychic communication between ETs and those capable of receiving their frequency. So that is Bill Cooper’s hypothesis. What do we make of it? Personally, my intuition tells me that disinformation has been fed to"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"212 him, but on the basis that the best disinformation mixes truth with fiction, we should not perhaps write it off in the rather arrogant way which some have done. No one has a monopoly on truth, especially when the Brotherhood security services are drooping disinfromation all over the place. I feel there has been contact between ETs and the American secret government, and that it continues today, but it does not have to be a dense physical interaction. It may be psychic communications between ETs and those capable of tuning to their frequency. The Brotherhood uses psychics a lot. Whatever is the reality of this, it’s about time the Pinnochio politicians of the world, especially those who claim to represent the American people in Congress, got off their knees and started making waves to make sure the relevant information on these ‘UFO’ incidents is made public. I feel that the time is not too far away when the truth of the ET connection will be made known. Another ‘insider’ who says he wants people to know what is happening, is Bob Dean. He says he was a soldier in the US Army for twenty-seven years and was promoted to Cosmic Top Secret Level, the highest in NATO, while serving at the S.H.A.P.E Headquarters in Europe. According to him, many UFOs were being tracked by NATO forces in the 1950s and ’60s. He suggests that an investigation was launched under the cover of a study called ‘An evaluation of a possible military threat to Allied Forces in Europe’. It included a report on what were said to have been twelve bodies found in Northern Europe in 1962. The report concluded says Dean, that the planet has been the subject of a detailed survey by extra-terrestrials of many kinds for hundreds, possibly thousands of years, and their technology was hundreds of years ahead of ours. I certainly agree with the analysis. Dean quotes Victor Marchetti, a former special assistant to the executive director of the CIA, as saying privately in 1979: “We have indeed been contacted, perhaps even visited by, extra- terrestrial beings, and the US Government, in collusion with the other powers of Europe, is determined to keep this information from the general public. The purpose of this international conspiracy is to maintain a working stability between the nations of the world, and for them, in turn, to maintain institutional control over their respective populations. “For these governments to admit that there are beings from outer"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"213 space with mentalities and technological capabilities obviously far superior to ours, could, once fully perceived by the average person, erode the foundations of the Earth’s traditional power structures. “Political and legal systems, religious, economic and social institutions, could all become meaningless in the minds of the general public. The national hierarchical establishments, even civilisation as we know it, could collapse into anarchy.” Researcher Tim Good in his books suggests that the RAF have had numerous experiences with UFOs and that their UFO investigations centre is within the headquarters of the Provost and Security Services at RAF Rudloe Manor in Wiltshire. The UFO Unit, it is said, operates secretly under the cover of an organisation called the Flying Complaints Flight. This unit is staffed by officers trained in counter-intelligence and it could well have been from here that the crop circle phenomena has been systematically destroyed in the public mind. The patterns in the crops have appeared all over the world, but it was when the amazingly detailed geometric patterns began to appear in Southern England in the early 1990s that the disinformation campaign really began. Public and media interest reached such a peak at the time that something had to be done to stop it. People were asking questions about possible causes, and they were beginning to realise that there was more to life and the Universe than they had been led to believe. In addition to the few materialistic tricksters trying to show that the phenomenon could be easily explained, there erupted organised campaigns to hoax, and to discredit the best known crop circle investigators. People appeared out of nowhere claiming to have made all the crop circles that appeared over decades all over the world. Ridiculous as this may seem, the public, which in general are incredibly gullible, bought the idea that the phenomenon was all a gigantic hoax. Interest in crop circles slumped dramatically. They are still appearing, with unhoaxable geometry, but only the enthusiasts know about them now. The media has lost all interest, because it is as gullible and as fickle as the general public, more so in some cases, and, of course, it has a tail to wag and a master to lick. I feel, however, that events will bring the crop patterns back onto the public stage. There is certainly a fantastic cover-up going on in the UFO field. But of what? Extra-terrestrials landing here, interacting with the elite, and abducting human beings? Or is this all just a smokescreen to hide"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"214 what is really happening? Other researchers, while agreeing on all the main themes of the New World Order conspiracy, believe that the claims about extra-terrestrials are all disinformation and that the genuine UFOs that people report are, in truth, human technology. They say that this advanced technology which is far ahead of anything the public know about, was not handed over by ETs in underground bases, but was developed by Illuminati scientists. This, some say, could have begun after the war when the Americans got hold of the work that had been done by Nazi scientists who the Brotherhood made sure escaped from Germany. Certainly it appears that the Nazi scientific and brotherhood elite had developed anti- gravity technology by the end of the war which used the Earth’s natural energy field for its power. It was so secret, Hitler possibly knew nothing about it because he wasn’t in control of events; the Brotherhood who controlled him were. This Nazi technology, it is claimed, looked like the UFOs many people describe. The American Academy of Dissident Sciences has details of this. So yes, say these researchers, there are UFOs, but they are built and flown by humans, not ETs. This theory says that the disinformation about ET landings are just a way of covering up the technology they have which, if it became generally available, would transform the world economy and free people from so much dependency on the System - because the technology used to fly these craft is the same as that which would provide free energy to everyone, without the need to use fossil fuels. It is also possible that the UFO theme is being used in the public mind to prepare for an ‘aliens are coming’ announcement which will justify a global state of emergency and centralised control. Anything is possible. Here we have another fusion of agreement by almost all investigators into these subjects. The Brotherhood elite have had, by whatever means, human or ET, the ability to travel in space at least since the 1 950s and, many researchers agree, they have established bases on the Moon and Mars under a project which has become known as Alternative Three. This was the name of an apparently fictional story that is perhaps nearer the truth than was originally thought. Maybe the Illuminati know the planet is about to undergo some great change on all levels and want some insurance, who knows? What I am sure about is that the first human landed on the Moon before 1969. When Apollo 11 touched down with Neil Armstrong’s ‘One small step for man, one giant step for mankind’, it"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"215 was pure Walt Disney. That ‘giant step’ had happened years earlier with technology far in advance of Apollo. The astronauts on that ‘first’ Moon landing were shocked at what they found there, because like most of the lower officials at Mission Control they didn’t know the background to what was going on. How stunned they must have been, but they knew the price of speaking out. According to Otto Binder, who worked on the NASA space programme, significant segments of the conversations between Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11 were not made public after they landed on the Moon. He says that people using VHF receivers to bypass NASA broadcasts heard this conversation: Mission Control: “What the hell was it? What’s there? Malfunction?” Neil Armstrong: “These babies are huge, sir......enormous. Oh God, you wouldn’t believe it. I’m telling you there are other spacecraft out there lined up on the far side of the crater edge they’re on the Moon watching us..” Even more amazing, those craft could well have had Americans on board! What a joke it all is. There is a good chance, too, that the information given to us about the nature of the Moon and Martian atmospheres is unture and that it is far more hospitable than we are led to believe. When, in 1960, President Kennedy agreed a programme to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, he innocently gave the Brotherhood elite a wonderful vehicle, to take out of the government system enormous amounts of money allocated to the ‘official’ space programme, and channel them into the unofficial one. Researchers suggest that the Americans and the Soviet Union, at Brotherhood levels, were working together throughout the so-called Cold War, another Illuminati creation. It was a means of frightening the populations on both sides into suffering appalling hardships, while their governments spent countless billions on weapons research and construction. No doubt there were other reasons, too. There was no prospect of either side using the weapons; that was not the idea. When one side got too far ahead technoligically, they would pass the information to the other through the brotherhood network. Once the stockpiles reached a certain level, the creation of more weapons could not be justified, except on the grounds of needing to keep ahead of the other side’s technology. If they made"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"216 sure that neither was too far advanced of the other, they could both go on demanding, and getting, more money for new research and development. This was especially important in America where they at least had to pay lip service to democratic accountability. Much of that development money was being channelled into the anti-gravity technology coming from either the ETs or their own scientists, depending on your point of view, and into building vast underground bases where the secrecy was ensured. Again both pro-ET and no-ET researchers largely agree that the underground facilities exist, though they may differ on precisely the reason for them. Some of the Star Wars budget was used for these secret purposes, too, and for other covert projects unkown to the people, and even most of the elected government. The USA were opponents of the Soviet Union? Hardly. The lower levels of both governments and the populations may have thought so, but the Brotherhood elite on both sides were on the same team and played for the same captain - Lucifer and possibly the negative ET group working through their consciousness. The Illuminati and its Brotherhood offshoots which control the CIA needed, and still do, a constant stream of massive funding for the covert projects they are involved in. These include the sort of things I have been outlining, and all the other manipulations the book has documented, like the support for civil wars and despotic dictators, which the CIA has secretly supported and brought to power to serve their interests. Next time you see an American president put his hand on his heart and talk about America standing for freedom, I should sit down before you fall over laughing. One of the main ways the covert projects are funded is through illegal drugs. Brotherhood branches and elements within the CIA and some of the world’s other secret services, control the world market in drugs. Cooper and other writers have stated this and it came very close to becoming widely known in the wake of the Iran-Contra Affair. Those who have investigated the CIA-drugs connection say it began in the late 1950s. It is claimed that the CIA and other agencies arranged to transport drugs from South America by sea to oil rigs drilling off the US coast. From there they could be brought ashore under the cover of the oil operations. Now the CIA and other Brotherhood branches control the enite world market in illegal drugs. The more the laws are tightened by so-called ‘Wars on Drugs’, the higher the street value. The American authorities have been so committed to the ‘War on Drugs’ that they have allowed US Oil companies to ship chemicals to South America"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"217 which are needed to make the drugs. The story of the Iran-Contra affair involving Oliver North during the Reagan Administration was the tip of a fantastic iceberg, and look at how easily it was covered up. The American people and media want a rocket directed at their backsides for allowing it to happen. The invasion of Panama by US forces in 1989 which cost twenty-six lives in Operation ‘Just Cause’ and led to the abduction to America of President Manuel Noriega, was linked to the covert drugs operation and the drug money laundered through Panama. One name that keeps coming up again and again as I read the work of investigators into all this is George Bush, the member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateralist, former head of the CIA, and President of the United States before Bill Clinton. He was also the President of the offshore division of Zapata Oil, it is alleged, when that company’s offshore oil rigs were used to bring in the drugs in the 1950s. Now it cannot be fair to make accusations like this against Mr Bush as some researchers do if he is innocent in these matters. Surely it is only right that, as with Pope John Paul II, the claims made about Mr Bush in relation to drugs and his family’s financial interests in Panama, are openly and publicly refuted with undeniable evidence so there can be no stain on his character whatsoever. All evidence points to a coordinated Brotherhood campaign to give young people every opportunity to take and become hooked on drugs. Today, finding drugs is often no problem for even children. The Brotherhood is at war with the young people of the world. It wishes to see them drugged, their spirits shattered, their minds filled with nonsense. They know that the energy and natural idealism of the young could cause them problems in their sinister ambitions. They need to crush the young, and that is what they are trying to do. It is time for the young people of this planet to open their eyes and refuse to be programmed. The Protocols make clear how they intended through this century to divert the young and the “Goyim” in general. It wants to stop people thinking for themselves and how well it has succeeded: “In order that the masses themselves may not guess what they are about we further distract them with amusements, games, pastimes, passions, people’s palaces..... Soon we shall begin through the press to propose competitions in art, in sport of all kinds; these interests"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"218 will finally distract their minds from questions in which we should find ourselves compelled to oppose them. Growing more and more disaccustomed to reflect and form any options of their own, people will begin to talk in the same tone as we, because alone we shall be offering them new directions of thought of course through such persons as will not be suspected of solidarity with us.” (Illuminati Protocol 13). One president who stood up for his principles was John Kennedy and he paid for it with his life in Dallas, Texas, on November 22nd 1963. Kennedy does not appear to have been from the Council on Foreign Relations. He scraped into power at the 1960 Election by less than 100,000 votes and the Brotherhood almost certainly wanted his challenger, Richard Nixon. There is, of course, great mystery and controversy surrounding (a) who killed Kennedy and (b) why? What there is no controversy about, to anyone with eyes and a brain, is that he was assassinated in a military style operation. The ‘evidence’ that he was killed by a ‘lone assassin’ Lee Harvey Oswald is so hysterical, I won’t insult your intelligence with it. Oswald was a member of the US secret services who was set up over a long period of time, and the Kennedy assassination was no last minute decision. It was carefully organised by the Brotherhood that runs the secret government of the United States. The ‘who?’ is clear to me, but what about the ‘why’. Kennedy was bad news for the Brotherhood elite. He promised to “splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces”. It is said by some researchers that he had found out about the drug operation and ordered it to be stopped: he certainly wanted to sort out the Federal Reserve, the cartel of Brotherhood banking interests that control the American economy; and he wanted to withdraw from the Brotherhood- engineered Vietnam War and end the cold war with the Soviet Union. All these things struck at the very heart of the Brotherhood operations and long term planning. Those researchers who accept the claims about the ET connection say that Kennedy had also found out about that, and was planning to reveal it; but I am not saying this is correct. The evidence uncovered by the courageous people who would not accept the cover-up has made it crystal clear that Oswald could not have been the assassin, and that the killer bullet came from the other direction. A cine film taken by an onlooker called Abraham Zapruder and suppressed by the government for many years makes this obvious, too. Bill Cooper believes the crucial shot came from the"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"219 driver of Kennedy’s car, secret service agent, William Greer and cites the Zapruder film in support of this. Others say the shot came from behind the crowd. Oswald said he had been set up, but he was conveniently killed by another stooge, the night club owner Jack Ruby, before he could come to trial. Witnesses who saw things that undermined the cover-up version of events were harrassed, intimidated, or killed. Kennedy’s body was rushed by plane from Dallas to Washington for autopsy by military pathologists who would do as they were told and make the ‘correct’ report. Near the scene of the assassination today, like some grizzly two fingers to the world, is an obelisk dedicated to freemasonry. This was nothing less than a Brotherhood coup on the United States. Kennedy was replaced by his vice-president, Lyndon Johnson, a freemason. He immediately ordered the blood-stained and bullet- holed car to be cleaned and repaired, so destroying more evidence, and just as quickly reversed Kennedy’s withdrawal policy in Vietnam. Under him the war quickly escalated and when it ended, two million Asian and 58,000 American lives had been lost and $220 billion had been spent. The Vietnam war was a grotesque human and financial killing in the classic Brotherhood mould. The Cold War also continued and weapons spending increased massively, just as the Brotherhood wanted. Johnson set up the pathetic Warren Commission to ‘investigate’ Kennedy’s death. Earl Warren was a freemason and the whole thing was the most obvious cover-up. Some witnesses said their evidence had been changed and even their signatures forged. Most of the Commission was made up of people from the Council on Foreign Relations, and the cover-up was completed by 33rd degree mason J Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI, and yet another freemason, the former CIA Director, Allen Welsh Dulles. Five years later, Jack Kennedy’s brother Robert was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after making a speech in his campaign to win the Democratic presidential domination. I believe that he, Martin Luther King, and John Lennon was all murderd by the same force. The Brotherhood makes and breaks presidents almost at will, and it is the same in other countries, too. According to Bill Cooper and others, President Nixon intended to fight to the end when faced with impeachment over the Watergate scandal. The Brotherhood wanted no such impeachment hearings and told him to resign. When he refused, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a top secret message to the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"220 commanders of US forces all over the world. According to Cooper, who claims to have seen the message while working for Naval Intelligence, it said: “Upon Receipt of this message, you will no longer carry out any orders from the White House. Acknowledge receipt”. It was another five days before Nixon resigned. Who replaced him? Thirty-third degree mason, Gerald Ford, who, in 1974, made Nelson Rockefeller his Vice-President. (The Thirty-thrid degree is divided into two parts - one knows the real agenda, the other does not.) Today, the Brotherhood secret government continues to control the United States and continues its preparations for global coup. A book by Bob Woodward, one of the journalists who investigated Watergate, is already suggesting that the economic policy of the Democrat, President Clinton, is being directed by Alan Green-span, the Republican chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who was appointed by President Reagan and re-appointed by President Bush. Clinton has also announced increased trading links with China, despite the disgraceful civil rights record of that country, but then money always speaks louder than principles. Is Bill Clinton a Thirty- third degree Mason as some researchers suggest? Is he a mason at all or a member of any other Brotherhood-type secret society? Has he ever been? What is his connection to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg Group? These are legitimate questions which the public needs to have answered. They are far more important, media of needs to America, than what he does or does not do in hotel bedrooms. One thing is for sure, if the Brotherhood had not selected Bill Clinton, with or without his knowledge, he would not be president: “Then it was that the era of republics became possible of realisation; and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a caricature of a government - by a president taken from the mob, from the midst of our puppet creatures, our slaves.” (Illuminati Protocol 10). What we also need to know is the extent of the Lucifer cults within American military intelligence and the CIA. One report has already come to light about Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Aquino, a senior officer within US Military Intelligence. He formed the Temple of Set (the ancient Egyptian name for Lucifer), and when it was made public, the authorities said they had no problem with that. If there"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"221 was a purge on secret, Lucifer-inspired, cults and societies within the secret services of the world, the intelligence network would probably collapse due to lack of personnel! Interestingly, Aquino served as a psychological warfare specialist in Vietnam and this has become an increasingly important weapon for the Illuminati. The secret development of mind control techniques by the intelligence agencies have also reached an advanced stage. These agencies operate outside of democratic control. Thirty-third degree freemason, Gerald Ford, launched a Commission to look into the workings of the security services after the Watergate scandal. Who did he ask to chair it? Nelson Rockefeller! If it wasn’t so tragic, you could almost laugh. The CIA and its fellow agencies around the world, including the British, have been spending billions on research into mind-controlling and population controlling- techniques. These involve, among other things, drugs, brain washing, brain implants to turn people literally into robots, the injection of experimental viruses, hypnosis, and the use of electromagnetic fields, according to researchers of these subjects. If you think humans have been robots up to now, stick around, unless we take action now. Mind control goes back to the ancient Brotherhood mystery schools and beyond. The Nazis were perfecting it before and during the war and so were the American agencies which became the CIA. In the 1950s the CIA was funding mind-controlling projects with code names like Project Bluebird (Artichoke after 1953) and later Project MK-ULTRA. The British and many other agencies were doing the same, as information crossed borders on the Brotherhood networks. The CIA was funding tests into LSD and similar drugs in the 1950s and ’60s and some horrendous experiments have been done in the state prisons and psychiatric institutions, involving children as well as adults. Don’t let them kid you the Nazis had a monopoly on such things. Anything they have done, the ‘good guys’ are also doing in the lands of ‘freedom andjustice’. As this book was going to press, the US Government admitted that people, including mentally handicapped children and pregnant mothers, had been used in the past for experiments, without their knowledge and consent, into the effects of radiation. The past? Similar things are still happening! So if you are seeking to escape this mad world through drugs.... don’t, don’t, don’t. LSD was not the liberating drug it was claimed by so many to be. It was researched and encouraged by the CIA, the British"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"222 Secret Service and others and, to a large extent, it thwarted the 1960s revolution and the desire of the baby boomers for mental freedom, by subverting their values with a lack of direction. Don’t let it happen again!! The mass prescribing of anti-depressants and other drugs world-wide is playing its part in advancing the zombie mentality which the Brotherhood want to bring about. Some of these techniques have undoubtedly been used to take out people who threaten Brotherhood operations. You can appreciate how it can be done when you see what one CIA psychiatrist said about the use of hypnosis and the implantation of minute electrodes in the brain: “The subject who was able to develop good post-hypnotic amnesia will also respond to suggestions to remember events which did not actually occur. On awakening, he will fail to recall the real events of the trance and instead will recall the suggested events. If anything, this phenomena is easier to produce than total amnesia, perhaps because it eliminates the subjective freling of an empty space in the memory.” What a great way to programme a ‘lone assassin’. I have no doubt that many of the ‘abductions’ claimed to have been by UFO occupants are in reality abductions by human servants of Lucifer in the Brotherhood. That is not to say that people aren’t abducted by ETs, but this is used as a cover for Brotherhood activities of exactly the same kind, too. Suggestions are implanted into the victims’ mind, as described above, so they believe they have been taken and implanted by ETs when it has really been done to them by humans. Under deep hypnosis by those who are investigating this phenomena, many of these ‘ET victims’ have recalled being taken away in a van, sometimes marked US Navy. Perhaps the vans are an example of the advanced technology that the Americans have given the ETs in exchange for theirs! I’ll swap you this inter-galactic, inter-frequency, anti-gravity craft, for a Ford truck. Yes, sounds reasonable. It’s a deal. Many people who have said they were abducted by UFOs have been found to have brain implants which can be seen on X-Rays. Apparent UFO victims have often recalled having operations during their ordeal, in which needles are inserted into the brain. Because this technology is not familiar to ‘normal’ science, it is assumed that it has come from some extra-terrestrial source. But, for whatever"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"223 reason, the science of the Brotherhood has put them years ahead of the science the rest of us know. Brotherhood scientists working on code-named projects have developed an electrode which can receive and transmit signals, produce visions and hallucinations, and have complete physical control of a person’s body. Given that the ETs have always known of these techniques, it puts some of the ‘spiritual revelations’ of St Paul, Moses, Mohamet, John of Revelations, and the Mormon founder, Joseph Smith, into another perspective, maybe? Too incredible to believe? Let me quote the words of Dr Jose Delgado, when he was a psychologist at Yale University decades ago: “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact.... it is even possible to create and follow intentions, the development of thoughts and visual experiences. By electrical stimulation of specific cerebral structures movements can be induced by radio command, hostility may appear and disappear, social hierarchy can be modified, sexual behaviour may be changed, and memory, emotions, and the thinking process may be influenced by remote control.” Want a lone assassin? No problem. Want an Israeli to kill a group of Arabs in an attempt to demolish peace talks? No problem. Want some guy to go into a school with a gun and start killing children to manipulate public opinion into demanding an armed or more authoritarian police force? Want to destroy the credibility of a group or organisation which threatens you by making one of its members do something terrible or ridiculous? No problem. We at the House of Mind Control can cater to your every desire. Why is it that most of the ‘lone assassins’ are made out to be mentally deranged or ‘nutters’. Who, or what, makes them like that? This is how John Lennon was killed. He threatened the Brotherhood with his promotion of peace, love, the eternal nature of the spirit, and his inspiration to the young. He was murdered by a mind-controlled attacker. If you don’t want to make a big public show of it, there is always the drug-induced heart attack or brain haemorrhage. Nor is this confined to the United States. An investigation in Sweden revealed that for the last twenty-five years doctors there have been using patients for on-going mind experimentation. They have been implanting transmitters into the brains of patients to use them like laboratory animals. The control of which Delgado speaks was possible in the 1950s and no doubt long before that."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"224 Today, the Brotherhood, thanks to its secret scientific research, have the ability for mass mind control. They have perfected the use of microwave pulses carrying instructions which can control individual or collective behaviour. Both the Americans and the Russians can do this. This knowledge of ‘psychic attack’ has been passed on over the centuries through the Brotherhood. An issue of the newsletter, ‘Tactical Technology’, in 1993 reported the latest developments in Russian technology of this kind. The report was about a visit to Russia in November 1991 of Janet Morris, the Research Director of the US Global Strategy Council, a think tank in Washington DC, founded by the former CIA Deputy Director, Ray Cline: “Morris and other members of a team sent to investigate Russian technologies for commercial development were invited to a demonstration of a mind control technology. A volunteer from the US team sat down in front of a computer screen as innocuous words flashed across the screen. The volunteer was only required to tell which words he liked and which he disliked. At the end of the demonstration the Russian staff started revealing the sensitive, innermost, thoughts of the volunteer - none of which had been previously discussed....... The Russians told Morris of a demonstration in which a group of workers were outside the hospital working in the grounds. The staff sent an acoustic psycho-correction message via their machine to the workers telling them to put down their tools, knock on the door of the hospital and ask if there was anything else they could do. The workers did exactly that, the Russians said. “The Russians admitted to using this technology for special operations team selection and performance enhancement and to aid their Olympic athletes and an Antarctic exploration team. Being an infra-sound, very low frequency-type transmission, the acoustic- correction message is transmitted via bone conduction. This means that earplugs will not restrict the message. An entire body protection unit system would be required to stop reception. The message, according to the Russians, by-passes the conscious level and is acted upon with exposure times of under one minute. Morris envisions this technology will be miniaturised into a hand-held device. Presently the International Healthline Corporation is planning to bring a team of specialists to the US in the near future to further demonstrate the capability.”"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"225 Want the British Cabinet, the House of Commons, the US President or Congress to come to decisions that suit you? No problem. Want to encourage civil wars and the most unspeakable behaviour to further justify a world army and government? And what if you want stock markets to react as you wish them to? When you look at this, it gives new meaning to the phrase: ‘Forgive them, they know not what they do.’ There is another sinister aspect to this that we must resist with everything we have. Everything about us is already kept on computer, and now the Brotherhood want to go a stage further and have our actions totally under their control. Once again they are trying to do this covertly under the cover of a ‘reasoned’ suggestion to help us. How kind they are. We are now hearing of the growth in credit card fraud and how something must be done so people can be identified more easily. What will be suggested is some kind of bar coding on each person - like they use on the goods in the supermarket - and in this way the authorities will know where we are, and what we are doing at all times. It would also be used to transmit messages to us like the computers and robots we would then be. They are already leading up to this by doing it with animals, and we are next if we allow it to happen. The Mann Humane Society in America explained the technique in an article by one of its public relations associates: “For nearly a year, the Marin Humane Society has been implanting every dog and cat adopted from the shelter with a micro-chip ID, a high-tech answer to the age old problem of permanently identifying your beloved pet. The micro-chip, about the size of an uncooked grain of rice, is encased in biomedical grade glass. The chip is imprinted with a ten-digit alphanumeric code and is implanted by simple injection between the animals shoulder blades. With the wave of a hand-held scanner, the chip is activated to transmit the code to a computer which provides the owner’s name and address, any relevant medical information and, most importantly, the owner’s phone number.” The Brotherhood of the New World Order want to go further than that with humans. They want us bar-coded so we can be ‘read’ at supermarkets and banks, like a checkout assistant now reads a tin of beans. A man at IBM who invented the lazer-bar reader for supermarkets has also developed a method of putting the same type of device under human skin in one billionth of a second. It is invisible to the naked eye and could carry all the information anyone"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"226 needed to know about us. We could be permanently linked to a computer, and who is to say that signals could not be sent both ways? Six thousand people in Sweden have already accepted a mark on their hands as part of an experiment into a cashless society, and trials have also started in Japan. Micro-chip implants are being inserted into people during abductions. They now want to dupe everyone into accepting it legally. Their ideal is to have every new born baby implanted as the normal course of events. They will use the excuse of medicine (this micro-chip will re-programme the body to fight disease), of finding missing people Oust think your child need never be lost again), and a string of other reasons. Each one might sound very reasonable in itself, but look at the hidden agenda. Don’t let it happen! Nor is electromagnetic and high technology limited to mind control. Its use is causing catastrophic damage to the physical body and the environment, besides being perfected for military use. Our non-physical selves are a series of interacting, electromagnetic energy fields, so we are affected at the core of our being by other electromagnetic fields. And if the etheric level is affected, the physical body malfunctions. For reasons of mind control and to create more efficient weapons system, waves of electromagnetic pulses are being generated across the world by particularly the United States. The US Omega Network, with stations in Nor-way, Argentina, Hawaii, Japan, Liberia, La Reunion Island, Australia, and the US are sending out low frequency ground waves as part of a nuclear weapons response system. These ground waves are causing ill effects for those who live in the area and for the Earth’s energy field. The Omega Network is only part of the mass of electromagnetic frequencies being emitted for reasons ofweaponry and control. These are responsible for an enormous number of cancers, cataracts, genetic defects, and mental illness. Robert Becker MD, an author and specialist in electromagnetic pollution, quoted in the incomparable Nexus Magazine, said this: “All abnormal man-made electromagnetic fields, regardless of their frequencies, produce the same biological effects. These effects, which deviate from normal functions and are actually or potentially harmful, are the following: “Effects on growing cells, such as increases in the rate of cancer cell division; increases in the incidence of certain cancers;"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"227 developmental abnor malities in embryos; alterations in neurochemicals, resulting in behavioural abnormalities such as suicide; alterations in biological cycles; decline in immune-system efficiency; alterations in learning ability.” It is this electromagnetic pollution that is the overwhelming cause of the dying forests, and while atmospheric pollution is terrible, this is used as a front for the main killer. But one Brotherhood technique is to use the threat to the environment as a justification for promoting the coordination powers of a world government. Throughout the decades since 1945, the CIA and other intelligence agencies on the Brotherhood network have been covertly working to increase conflict and control. The Suez ‘crisis’ in the 1950s was an example of how the Allies even dupe each other. ExCIA man Miles Copeland tells in his autobiography of how the British Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, became so obsessed with removing Egypt’s President Nasser after he had nationalised the Suez Canal, that the US Secretary of State expected to be asked any day by the British to agree an assassination plot. This would have been rather difficult for the Americans because they were supporting Nasser and hoping he would help to reduce the influence of Islam. As Copeland points out: “At this time, the CIA station chief received a message from [CIA Director] Allen Dulles himself, sent at the insistence of his brother, [the Secretary of State], directing us to examine ways in which, if push came to shove, Nasser could be killed. “There was a negative tone to the message which implied that the Dulles brothers would welcome a carefully thought out reply to the effect that Nasser was invulnerable, but we were not, of course, to mention the fact that we were the reason he was out of reach of would-be assassins since we had ourselves designed the security arrangements around him. “......And now I must make an even more arresting admission. While the ‘straights’ in Washington were increasingly displeased with the anti-American content of Nasser’s public utterances and the anti- American propaganda that poured out of Radio Cairo, the Middle East’s most far reaching voice, can you guess who was writing a goodly portion of the material? We were. We understood, as Nasser did at that time, the new regime’s hold on the country depended on its being consistently and convincingly anti-American, and that Nasser"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"228 couldn’t even risk an indication of reasonableness towards our various Middle East policies..... We took pains to make it counter- productive, of course, and we included a lot of patent nonsense, but we kept virtually in control of its production.” With the above in mind, look again at the anti-American speeches of Saddam Hussein at the time of the Gulf War in 1991. There can never have been a more obviously orchestrated conflict than that. The Americans made it plain to Saddam that if he went into Kuwait they would not react. He went in and they reacted. On 25th July 1990, Saddam met with the US Ambassador, April Gillespie, after he had told the Arab nations and the Soviet Union that he intended to invade Kuwait! They did not object. According to cables released in July 1991, Gillespie deliberately misled Sad-dam who believed that the US took the same view. She was acting under instructions from the White House. The then-president Bush seemed content to use sanctions at first, but suddenly over a short period US forces began to arrive in large numbers. The United Nations gave the US ‘permission’ to attack Saddam under their flag and, with support from countries like Britain and France, they unleashed their macho men on the Iraqis. The US were keenly supported by Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, where the Saudi branch of freemasonry is largely based at the US oil company, Aramco. When the American (sorry), UN forces had the Iraqis in disarray and could have moved on to take Baghdad to remove the dictator they claimed to hate so bitterly, they stopped. Why? Because they didn’t want Saddam removed, he was too useful where he was - if; indeed, the real Saddam was still alive by then. I’m not convinced that the man who is now claimed to be Saddam is the same person that we saw before he ‘disappeared’ for so long through and after the war. Some channelled information I was given a few days ahead of the Gulf conflict said: ..... There is no way to appease the situation as only a few know the truth of the real situation. Here we have a war of economics, money, materialism, but most of all greed. The monies do not go to the people, but into the coffers of only a few because of corruption and secrecy. As the walls fall on the economic crisis so will dishonesty come to light. It will involve those that you trust as well as those you do not trust.”"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"229 The ‘victory’ over Saddam was portrayed as the effectiveness of the United Nations, and what a benefit a UN (Brotherhood) army could be. Once again the media poodle wagged its tail through the Gulf War period, and whenever you read a paper or see a news bulletin, remember above all else that nothing is ever what it seems to be. The plan for world domination continues apace across the planet today as the secret armies are trained and prepared with government funding behind fake names and fake projects. One of these in the United States is called the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This has a budget of billions of dollars, and yet it wasn’t even created under constitutional law. It is the result of a Presidential Executive Order. In 1935, the Emergency Management Act was passed to give the President the right to by-pass Congress and make laws in times of national emergency. Fair enough, you might think. Sometimes you have to act quickly when there’s an emergency. The little point they don’t tell you is that there is always officially a state of national emergency in the United States! This gives the President powers to make laws whenever he wishes, and have them ready and waiting for the time when they can all be implemented at once. You might like to know that these executive orders passed since 1935 have given the President the power to do the following, whenever he decides there is increased international tension or economic crisis: To take over all transport, roads, and ports; all media; the power industries; food production and farms; all aircraft; relocate communities and mobilise people into work brigades under government supervision; start a national registration scheme. The list goes on, and when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot challenge it for at least six months. “He (the President) will have the right to propose temporary laws, and even new departures in the government constitutional working, the pretext both for the one and other being the requirements for the supreme welfore of the State...... “We shall invest in the president the right to declare a state of war. We shall justify this last right on the ground that the president as chief of the whole army of the country must have it at his disposal for the defence of the..... constitution.” (Illuminati Protocol 10)."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"230 FEMA came into being this way. It was started by..... Zbigniew Brzezinski; remember him? He started the Tn-Lateral Commis sion with Rockefeller money, and served as National Security Advisor for the first Tri-Lateralist President, Jimmy Carter. Brzezinski stayed on after Carter’s defeat, to continue his work with FEMA under Ronald Reagan. FEMA’s public face is presented as an organisation that reacts to national emergencies -everything from a nuclear attack to an earthquake or an urban riot. Strange then, you might think, that only six percent of its budget is spent on national emergencies. The rest is used to construct underground facilities for the government in time of ‘foreign or domestic’ emergency, and to build ‘holding facilities’, prisons and ‘refugee facilities’, none of which have ever been used for such purposes. So why are they building them? FEMA has around 3,600 employees, and yet only sixty work on natural disasters or prepare plans in case of nuclear attack. What are the rest doing? Two familiar names were in charge of FEMA for a number of years: General Richard Secord and Colonel Oliver North, who worked with the CIA and US Air Force to smuggle weapons in what became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. FEMA is another major arm of the secret government. One of its aims is to disarm the American people. Now, I’m all for getting rid of weapons of all kinds, but again you need to look at the motives behind it. If you are planning a takeover, a coup against what passes for a democratic order, then it is much easier if the population is unarmed. And what do you need to justify laws taking away the public’s right to own a gun under American law? More violent, high profile crime. Exactly what you need to justify the arming of police forces like those of Britain, which have not carried arms as a matter of course in the past. Incidentally, the American Gun Control Act of 1968 is word for word the Nazi Gun Control Law of 1938. Another branch of the secret government working with FEMA is the Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force (MJTF), which was started by President George Bush. Bill Clinton talks of the need for a national police force when he already has one. The MJTF is now in almost all American states, and its role is house-to-house searches, the seizure and ‘categorising’ of men, women and children, and their transfer to detention centres (built by FEMA, remember), and the interrogation of these people. We are talking about concentration camps here, ladies and gentlemen. Twenty-three such camps were authorised originally and another twenty were allowed for under the 1990-91"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"231 military budget. The MJTF recruits from urban street gangs, who are now allowed to do legally what they have been doing illegally for most of their lives, to enter homes, take possessions etc. They are too stupid to see that they are being used, and that they will be removed too, when their purpose is served. The third element in this triangle is the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FINCEN). This is made up mostly of people from overseas police forces and military, particularly European. FINCEN in Montana has a number of Gurkas in its ranks. They have thousands of helicopters and other aircraft at their disposal, which are appropriately painted black. Many times, black helicopters have been seen near the occurrence of cattle mutilations which are said to be the work of ETs. FINCEN personnel are trained to land, do their dark deeds, and then disappear into the sky very quickly. The Brotherhood-controlled United Nations is supporting and helping to coordinate these operations. All it takes is one major manufactured ‘crisis’, and the starting gun fires. Goodbye democracy, or what claims to be democracy. I understand the plans for the takeover of the United States are now well advanced. Part of this is for Michigan, for instance, to become known as ‘Area 5’, with its capital as Chicago and its governor appointed by the President without the complications of an election. One p05sible ‘emergency’ to set off this chain of events could be that of a terrorist with a nuclear weapon, threatening to destroy the United States. Watch for such a deceit, because something like this will be used to justify the coup in its first stages, if it gets that far. These covert preparations for the New World Order are not confined to the United States. They are happening in all the major countries, with most of the politicians having no idea of what is going on behind their backs, or what the money they are allocating is really being spent on. In Britain the laws are getting more sinister every year. The Department of Transport pays security firms and private investigators to identify those who protest peacefully against road projects that destroy the environment, and it sends innocent people to prison for the crime of trying to stop this madness of taking the human race out of existence. We must challenge this by protesting in even greater numbers. They can’t arrest us all!

Don’t forget that some of it"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"232 could have been planted to deceive in the first place. I certainly do not claim that every detail in this book is correct. I have taken the findings of many researchers and tried to weave a story from this wealth of combined information, using my intuition and the common threads as my guide. I would not stake my life on every detail, but I would on the themes. Throughout the process of my spiritual awakening I have been left in no doubt when I am being guided to an area of knowledge that needs to be made public. Suddenly information on a specific subject comes in from all directions, and never more so than with the New World Order. I had only vaguely heard of the term until, over a period of three weeks, all the information about it in this book was put into my hands by a variety of different people. Those on the higher levels who are guiding me wanted this information put in the book, and made available to the public. It really doesn’t matter whether you believe ETs are involved or not. The outcome is the same - a covert attempt to take over the world by duping the mass of the population and ‘removing’ those who refuse to play ball. That’s the simple fact we all need to keep focussed on. The Brotherhood will not succeed ultimately, because the transformation of consciousness now unfolding will sweep their plans away eventually. They may use a lot of twisted Egyptian mythology to justify their ambitions, but they should remember that in those stories Horus, the son, defeats Set in the final battle. So it will be. But what the Lucifer - (Set) - controlled Brotherhood can do is make the transition far more difficult, painful and traumatic, and hold back the spiritual awakening of millions of people. They are using the increasing violence and conflict, the collapsing global economy and the threat to the environment - all of which they are, to a large extent, causing - to hookwink the people into the nightmare of a world government, world central bank, world currency, world army, and global control. Perhaps waiting in the wings is the claim that the planet is in imminent danger of an alien invasion. This could well be the card they are preparing to play to coerce a terrified population into willingly handing over all the centralised power the Brotherhood desire. I have noticed that suddenly the media is full of ‘alien abduction’ stories and such like, and information is being released into the public arena about ‘aliens’ on perhaps a bigger scale than ever before. This makes me even more wary about some of the more extreme claims about extra-terrestrial"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"233 activities. Is public opinion being prepared for the ‘aliens are coming’? Who knows the truth? All I can say is that if you hear that the ‘aliens are invading’ and the authorities start taking emergency powers, please, please, be very careful before you believe it. Remember the Illuminati want you to accept central world control of the governments, banks, currency and army. Anything that seeks to justify that is the Illuminati at work and we must refuse to accept it. The Illuminati want to manipulate you into giving them authoritarian powers, and once that has occured an extreme, and I can’t stress enough the word extreme, facist government will be imposed across the world. “When we at last definitely come into our kingdom by the aid of coups d’état prepared everywhere for one and the same day, after the worthlessness of all existing government has been definitely acknowledged... we shall.. slay without mercy all who take arms to oppose the coming of our kingdom. Every kind of new institution of anything like a secret society will also be punished with death.” (Illuminati Protocol 15). “We shall create an intensified centralisation of government in order to grip in our hands all the force of the community. [New laws]... will withdraw one by one all the indulgences and liberties which have been permitted by the Goyim and our kingdom will be distinguished by a despostism of such magnificent proportions as to be at any moment and in every place in a position to wipe out any Goyim who oppose us by deed or word.” (Protocol 5). “The Goyim are a flock of sheep, and we are the wolves. And you know what happens when the wolves get hold of the flock? There is another reason also why they will close their eyes: for we shall keep promising them to give back all the liberties we have taken away as soon as we have quelled the enemies of peace and tamed all parties... It is not worth while to say anything about how long a time they shall be kept waiting for this return of their liberties.” (Protocol 11). We have a big decision to make.

THIS first half of the book is not a detailed history of the world, nor is it meant to be. I have merely sought to pick out certain key themes which, I feel, will help us to end the violence, destruction, and the control behind it. Most people who have been incarnate on the planet over these thousands of years were not, as individuals, all murdering, persecuting bigots. I am the first to say that, and I stress it again now. Most lived their lives in the best way they could within the confines of this dense physical form and the limitations of the world around them. Most do not come into incarnation to cause suffering, that is not their intention. They want to serve the planet, not destroy her. But once we incarnate we can become like dodgem cars in a fairground, hooked up to the same thought patterns and, to varying degrees, with the Luciferic consciousness at the wheel. I remember my friend Yeva having a psychic vision once when I was with her that gave some idea of what it must be like waiting to incarnate. She saw millions of people being told about what was happening here and how best to remember who they were after incarnation. The overwhelming feeling she had during this vision was the frustration of these beings. They knew what needed to be done on the Earth, but they also knew that after incarnation the pressures were such that they were likely to act in the same destructive ways as those currently in dense physical bodies. Before we become consumed by guilt over all that has happened through human history, we should remember that this is a tough place to be at the moment, and has been for a long time. When I highlight the destructive behaviour of humans over these thousands of years I am not judging or condemning individuals. I am challenging the thought patterns, imbalances, and downright mind control that have motivated that behaviour. The Augustines, Jeromes, Hitlers, and"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"236 sundry popes, are victims also. It is their thought patterns I challenge and seek to expose, not them as eternal beings. I have given this negative force a symbolic name, Lucifer, for simplicity, but really it is an extreme imbalance which we can all be subject to if we let our values drop. This is not, however, humanity’s natural state. I say again: We are intrinsically good, not evil. It is the unique density of this planet and the severe negative influences that are behind our actions, and the only way we can change that is to think for ourselves and synchronise with our higher levels. Accepting that those levels exist is the first and most important step we can take. One thing is very clear from the patterns addressed by the book so far. Whenever we have had the free flow of all information into the public arena and everyone has respected another’s right to interpret that information in ways that feel right to them, human evolution has surged ahead. Whenever the free flow of information has been stemmed and doctored and one belief system imposed, human evolution has stopped or declined. We need to keep this at the forefront of our thinking as we search for ways to build a fair and balanced world in the years to come. To some people it may appear that I see a conspiracy behind every corner, but I don’t. I am a great believer in the ‘cock-up factor’ of history, too, and not every event is the Brotherhood at work. But I have been trying to chart a path through the last twenty thousand years or so, to pick out common links and connections. This has led me, and growing numbers of others around the world, to believe that there is indeed a central conspiracy of manipulation which threads its way through human history. When I look at all the coincidences that happened in a few weeks to present me with information about this conspiracy before the book was completed, it is clear that other levels of consciousness want people to know that there is some serious string-pulling going on, and it is time that the puppeteers were exposed. They can’t control events if we will not cooperate. We have the power, not they, if only we could recognise it. What I hope I have succeeded in doing in the first half of the book is to highlight the following: (1) That over thousands of years a Brotherhood of secret societies has emerged which has been used to manipulate humanity in the most fundamental and horrific ways, and that its goal of world dictatorship is planned to be imposed in our lifetimes. (2) That extra-terrestrials have probably had a fundamental"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"237 impact on human evolution. (3) That far from civilising the world, Christianity and other dogmatic, imposed, religions have held back our evdlution for at least two thousand years. (4) That the free flow of all information and knowledge is the path to freedom and understanding, a fact confirmed by the constant examples of Church and political dictatorships destroying alternative views to their dogma and control. (5) That the ills of the world have been overwhelmingly caused by the great majority allowing themselves to be blindly led by the few. (6) That the belief that anyone has a monopoly on truth and wisdom is probably the most destructive and stupid belief it is possible to have. (7) That to believe our dense-physical bodies are superior to another race or culture is, along with religion and greed, the cause of almost every war and conflict experienced by humankind. (8) That the virtue of forgiveness really is the only way we are going to break the cycles of vengeance and revenge. I’d like to expand on those last three points. Our belief that the physical body is ‘us’ in total has to change if we are to be set free from these cycles. It is this belief that leads people to seek revenge in this life for what was done to the ancestral line of their bodies hundreds and even thousands of years ago, when the body is merely the vehicle for their consciousness to experience this dense physical world. It is like two people in different spacesuits on the Moon having a fight because cf what two other spacemen did to each other while wearing the same kind of spacesuits years before. We would say that was crazy and yet look at Northern Ireland, the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, and so on and that, in effect, is what they are doing. Only by recognising this can it be stopped. This is one reason why the Illuminati have worked so hard to keep the spiritual truths from the mass of the people, and it is vital that this suppressed knowledge as set out in this book be widely known. Even then this understanding has to be wider and more mature than belief systems like Hinduism which uses karma and reincarnation to justify some horrific behaviour. Also, giving responsibility for our actions to someone else is like handing over a lethal weapon. Once we look to others to lead us and tell us what to do and think we are building the"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"238 foundations of all the violence, pain, and suffering I have documented. The great majority of those who persecuted non-believers or different believers actually thought they were carrying out the wishes of God. They had allowed themselves to be so mind-controlled that whatever they were told was God’s command they followed to the letter. No-one would have persuaded them they were doing anything wrong. They were people of their time, controlled by the belief system programmed into them. Today it’s still the same with billions of people mind controlled to think the way the brotherhood demands and they ridicule, condemn, and even murder those who challenge its nonsenses and control. What is the difference, except in background and scale, between that and the horrors of religious and political persecution in the past? Both are the result of the same non-thinking, the same robotic responses, and the desire to pass responsibility to think and act to others. What makes it most effective for the forces of destruction is that people who don’t think are persuaded that they do. Nothing is more dangerous than a closed mind that thinks it’s open. It is the ultimate illusion, and yet I meet people like that every day. We have lurched from extreme to extreme over most of the last twelve thousand years and more because we have not, collectively, had the humility to appreciate that we do not know it all, or even nearly so. There is no way we will balance all knowledge and understanding while one group thinks it has all the answers and the others think the same. We had the Roman Catholic Church that persecuted non-believers because it believed itself to have the truth; then came the Protestants who persecuted Roman Catholics for the same reason; then the Protestants broke up into factions caused by the minutest of difference between them, and they persecuted each other because each believed they had the truth; then came materialistic science which proceeded to marginalise and condemn those in its own profession who challenged the this-world-is-all- there-is dogma. Each faction and dogma decides it has the truth, builds an empire of income and influence, and defends that against all comers, especially if they bring new knowledge to question the status quo. This mentality sees the preservation of privilege through the status quo as far more important than the advancement of human understanding. Whoever has their hands on the wheel seeks to keep everyone else out of the vehicle. The ‘ba ba’ mentality in which the masses do as the few, even"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"239 sometimes the one, tells them is at the heart of the control of the human consciousness. Divide and rule is the great truism. How can it be that one or a small group of people have controlled millions in the countries and empires of human existence? What was that Gandhi said? ‘100,000 Englishmen cannot control 300 million Indians if those Indians will not co-operate.’ Instead whole civilisations have gone ‘ba ba’ and followed the leader of the herd. Or they have allowed themselves to be offered privileges by the dictator, be it a man, woman, or system, and ignored the injustices their fellow humans suffer. That is plainly true of the world today. But I remember what Pastor Niemoeller, a victim of the Nazis, said: “First they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and there was no-one left to speak out for me.” If we ignore injustice against others we are just as responsible as those who directly cause that injustice. Again as Gandhi said: ‘Silence is connivance’. It is time to let the divisions fall away and stand up for each other. They might be able to imprison, kill, or discredit a few who say enough is enough, but they can’t do it to millions standing side by side together. Power is only the ability to persuade one group of people that you have power over them. Power is an illusion and is shown to be so when all people stand together and peacefully say no, this is not right and not acceptable. Running through all these themes across the centuries of human existence is the need for revenge.. If anything this is the most destructive of all emotions. We all feel it instinctively when we feel someone has treated us unfairly. That is understandable within the pressures of this planet. Many times in my life when people have acted negatively towards me, I have had a wish to pay them back. Sometimes that feeling still flows through me when something happens that I feel particularly strongly about. But we need to take a breath and think before we react instinctively looking for revenge. If you do that and look at the wider consequences this destructive desire for revenge can be dispersed. It doesn’t mean you don’t still feel hurt, but the need to punish those you believe responsible is released. This is so important, I cannot stress it enough. As Chief Seattle"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"240 said: “when our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong and disfigure their faces with black paint, their hearts, also, are disfigured and turn black. Then their cruelty is relentless and knows no bounds. Our old men are not able to restrain them. True it is that revenge is considered gain, even at the cost of their own lives, but old men who stay at home in times of war, and old women who have sons to lose, know better.” What we have seen so far in the book are cycles of vengeance and revenge. The cycle of one persecuting the other and the need for righting that wrong by further, often greater, persecution in return. Mostly it is the innocent who suffer not the persecutors. Not every Puritan wanted to persecute those of another faith, nor every Roman Catholic, or Anglican. But they were still the victims of the other side when they came back for revenge. Unless we forgive our enemies, including the Illuminati, we cannot possibly break these cycles of human and planetary pain and destruction because the lust for revenge will go on. Forgiveness may appear to be an old and familiar theme, but wisdom is not new. It is as old as Creation itsel£ Forgiveness has, and always will be, the key to human progress. I would not claim for one second that it is easy in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, but it remains the only way. If we are to build the new World, a task we will discuss in Part Two, we will only step out of the cycles of darkness if we forgive each other, reject mind control, and refuse to be sheep led by human, extra-terrestrial or misguided non-physical shepherds. It is time to open our eyes and our hearts and take responsibility for our thoughts and actions. It is time to wake up and grow up. If we do that, an astonishing future awaits us, and it is to that vision we will now turn."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"241 This page is intentionally left blank to follow the pagination of the printed book."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"242 This page is intentionally left blank to follow the pagination of the printed book."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"243 PART TWO THE LIGHT"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"244 14 Goodbye to all That DURING the ‘baby boom’ years after the last World War there was a mass incarnation of the volunteer souls.. Some volunteers had come earlier and others have arrived in the forty-odd years since then. The ‘volunteer’ babies born in those immediate post war years were, however, the biggest influx of those who had chosen to be at the cutting edge of change and transformation. To quote a channelled message from Truth Vibrations: “Those of you who are at the forefront of this, you are rather like a snowplough. You are the thin end of the wedge. You really have, how shall I put this? To a certain extent, I suppose, you have the shitty end of the job. You have got to do an awful lot, but nevertheless you are capable of doing an awful lot. That is why you have chosen to come, that is what you are hear for, to really shovel some shit, and therefore make some space behind you to make it easier for the others.” I should point out that when thought forms from higher levels are decoded by the lower self and the brain they are often spoken and written in the channeller’s own style. While some would say you have come to remove the negative domination, others would say you have come to shovel some shit. Either way, the volunteers who have incarnated to be alive at this time - not only the post war babies by any means - are here to play their part in changing human consciousness by returning it to its natural state of love, peace, compassion, and wisdom. The volunteers task is to help the planet so she can heal herself; to remove the brotherhood domination, and to leave the babies and young children of today with a clear run to create a new world without the Luciferic influence to trouble them."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"245 The volunteers are being supported by a vast network of highly evolved entities on other frequencies and by extra terrestrials who wish to free the planet from those who have other, less laudable, ambitions for the human race. It is sorting out time. The volunteers are being guided to complete three main tasks: (1) To raise human consciousness by passing on information that opens the mind and helps people to remember what they already know deep down about the nature of life, Creation, and the current transformation. This helps them to re-synchronise with their higher selves and access more of their eternal knowledge. (2) To repair the energy grid and prepare the Atlantean system for the time to come soon, when it replaces the temporary system that has been in operation over the thousands of years since then. This involves the re-activation of the harmonic keys which will unlock those incredibly powerful energies which were turned down, or off; at the end of Atlantis, as symbolised in the King Arthur legends. (3) To channel energies into the Earth that will balance out the severe negative domination in her energy field caused by all the negativity generated by the pain, conflict, and violence documented in this book. In this chapter I will look at some of the ways this is being done, how everyone can help, and the sort of effects we can expect in our everyday lives. Energies are being channelled into the grid by volunteers who are collectively known as Light Workers. Anyone can do this as I explain in my book, Heal the World. It is not an exclusive club for the chosen ones. There are no ‘chosen’ ones, only people. Energy passes through their energy fields and physical bodies and is transformed into a frequency the Earth can absorb. On these occasions the human body becomes like an acupuncture needle for the planet, channelling and balancing energy flows. Since my conscious awakening in 1990, I have been all over the United Kingdom and to many parts of the world doing this, places like Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, the United States, Italy, Egypt, Israel, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, and France. I have had some amazing experiences along the way as I recount in my autobiography, In The Light Of Experience. Tens of thousands are knowingly doing this work and millions, unknowingly. These energies which are coming in to raise the frequency of the Earth’s energy field are, to a large extent, the Photon Beam I mentioned in the early part of the book. The orbit of the Solar System"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"246 is taking us back across the Photon Beam, the rebalancing beam of highly charged particles which offers the chance for those who are ready to raise themselves to a higher frequency. The Earth Spirit, the energy field of the planet, is due to do just that. The period of the opportunity for the Luciferic consciousness is coming to an end and it will have to wait until another opportunity is offered either by humanity or another consciousness stream. It is reckoned to take 2,000 years for the Earth to cross the beam and so all this won’t happen tomorrow, but major changes are upon us. Entering the beam is like crossing the light cast by a lighthouse or torch beam. You enter in the more diffused, weaker, light first and then you go on to pass across the centre where the light is most powerful. I believe that sometime in the last century the Earth began to move into the diffused ‘light’ of the Photon Beam and by the 1960s it was having an obvious effect on those who were open to it. You don’t have to open yourself to it and the changes it is creating in the energy field of the planet. There is no compulsion, but there are consequences. Many people, especially the young, tuned to these energies in the 1960s and it manifested as the period known as ‘Flower Power’. Energy is consciousness and the energies carried the information and knowledge which inspired the values behind the sixties phenomenon. If you listen to much of the flower power music and the protest songs of that time, you will hear the themes of vibrations - good, bad, and changing vibrations - of love for all, and of the times they are a changing. All three reflect a knowledge of what is happening in this time of the Great Awakening of humankind. Through the 1970s and the ’80s as the brotherhood pulled in the other direction and sought to destroy such thinking, we still saw the rise of environmental awareness, the growth in animal welfare movements, of vegetarianism, and explosions of human compassion like Live Aid. Now, in the 1990s as we move further on into the beam, wake up time is upon us as the rebalancmg of the Earth’s energy field helps us to re-connect with higher levels of ourselves and so become ‘whole’. I meet people all the time who have suddenly awakened and begun to see the world in a new light. They cannot understand why they could not see before what is now obvious to them. But the reason is simple. Earlier in their lives they were working mostly through the conscious level only, that part of us which is subject to the severe limitations of the dense physical body. This can, and mostly is, programmed by the messages it constantly receives through the eyes"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"247 and the ears in this Lucifer-controlled world and we can believe some ridiculous things. When we reconnect with all levels, our perceptions reflect the guidance of our higher wisdom and understanding and we see what a daft world we live in. When this re-connection happens it can be like a dam bursting as knowledge and information floods into the conscious level and it can be a traumatic time as you try to make sense of what is happening to you and your life. I have written about this in Heal The World. The higher we can all raise our own vibratory state by thinking, searching, and seeking truth, wisdom, love and understanding, the higher the vibrations that can be passed through us into the Earth and the quicker we remove the Luciferic domination. A channelled communication in Truth Vibrations explained something of this. Speaking of the energies switched off in the latter days of Atlantis, it said: “As the energies around your planet quicken, so these latent energies which have been withdrawn will be phased back in. They will gradually be awakened. As the consciousness of your planet raises itself those of you Light Workers who are working together to raise your consciousness, you will be able to hold more and more refined vibrations, and so we will be able to use you as a catalyst to be able to feed in more and more energies. As more of you raise your consciousness, so we can awaken more of these energies.” The books on the subject, the talks, the media interviews, the discussions with friends, and the energy channelling are all helping to awaken people and raise the frequency of the energy field. Most of the awakening is being triggered by energy changes on the non- physical levels, and even when I speak I can feel energy pouring through me to the audience and vice versa. That is where the most important interchange is going on. But words, written and spoken, are also an energy and they can be extremely powerful in getting information to the conscious level to challenge the programming. With every person who changes his or her thinking, we are another step nearer to that point when the power of such understanding is strong enough in the collective mind of humanity for that to become available to everyone, as in the hundredth monkey syndrome. It is in the collective mind that Lucifer is being challenged most powerfully. I believe we are getting close to that ‘critical mass’ when the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"248 collective mind begins to be a source of positive rather than negative influence upon we ‘individuals’ who are connected to it. When that happens we will see people change with a speed that will beggar belie£ But I am not suggesting this time of change will be easy for anyone. Those who have come here to be at the sharp end of this transformation have often been ‘tested’ to the very limits of their endurance, especially on the emotional level. This has been designed to unleash all their inner emotional and mental strength and courage. Now is the time when all that has been experienced in previous physical lifetimes will have to be called upon because the Luciferic consciousness and its expressions through the economic, political, military and industrial establishment is not going to go quietly. But have no fear that it is going to go. It is already on the way. People who are awakening are finding themselves at odds with the society in which they live, and even within their families, too. As they expand their consciousness, they are accessing higher levels of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. Those with the courage to outwardly express how they feel are challenging conventional thinking and behaviour of almost every kind. They are called anything from ‘loony’ to ‘dangerous’ by those still mesmerised by the physical world. The Luciferic consciousness works hard to undermine them, just as it did 2,000 years ago and on so many other occasions through history. But it will not succeed. What will happen - is happening - is that the numbers opening up to these changes will go on increasing until they are the majority. Those who resist will eventually go out of incarnation and continue their evolution on a level suitable to their current state of being. They won’t cease to exist because we all live forever, but they will no longer be able to live on this planet as her frequency moves well behind theirs. Around the planet is a frequency range. As this rises, some of the lower frequencies fall out of the range. You could think of it as like climbing a ladder. With each higher rung that your hands reach, your feet are leaving others behind. The consciousness still tuned to those lower ‘rungs’ as the Earth moves on will be affected in many ways. Their vibratory rate will be falling out of synchronisation with the planet’s energy field in which they live. This will affect their behaviour, their mental and emotional stability, and their physical health. These will consist of the Brotherhood and the people still clinging"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"249 on to the old order. This will create tensions between those wishing to bring change and freedom of lifestyle and expression, and those who want to resist the inevitable by trying to force people to conform to old structures. For those with closed minds who cling on to the status quo the time will come when the vibratory gap between them and the planet will be so wide they will go out of incarnation. The effects on their behaviour will add to the negative aspects of this transition period and it is up to everyone to help them with love and understanding. I would stress, though, that not everyone who leaves their physical shell in the years ahead will be suffering from the effects of vibratory change. Many will be moving on at the moment they always planned, their experience in this incarnation completed. But those who are going with the changes and those who are not will become clearer with every month from now on. In Heal The World, I have suggested ways in which we can increase the speed of this tuning in process by healing ourselves and the planet. For have no doubt, healing ourselves, loving and forgiving ourselves, is the only way we will heal the Earth and allow the Earth to heal us. Healing ourselves spiritually and emotionally changes the nature of the energies we generate into the world. Love is the most powerful of all energy. Love is the answer. The vibratory changes, hastened at certain times by particular astrological alignments, will affect the whole world. Nothing and no- one will be the same again. Everything is the same consciousness in different states of being. So if that consciousness is changing in our part of Creation it must affect everything - the way we think; our emotions; our bodies; the physical Earth; the weather; and, for those who choose to resist these changes to the end, even their ability to stay in incarnation. A channelled message in 1990 spoke of the implications for relationships and attitudes. These themes are clear in the letters I receive and the people I meet: “I feel now you are sensing the energies coming in, the energies surrounding your planet. This is causing many of you to ask questions. It is causing many of you to re-evaluate completely your way of life, where you feel you wish to go, what you want to do. It is causing tremendous upheavals. Some of these are very confusing, very distressing, very disturbing. Some people in relationships are finding they can no longer continue in those relationships because their partners cannot tune in to what they have been tuning into. It is"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"250 causing a great deal ofdisturbance. And I have said to this sensitive (channeller) on more than one occasion that you must organise yourselves into groups to support each other..” Even some long standing relationships are ending as one partner chooses to take the spiritual path and the other does not. People who have always had so much in common are suddenly like strangers to each other. They are literally on different wavelengths. Once one partner begins to react to the changes and go with them, the urgings of their inner self will be far more powerful than their desire to protect a relationship, much as they may love their partner. Some will leave for long periods to follow their path, others will part for good. But when both partners choose to follow the frequencies, their relationship will grow stronger and evolve to a new level and understanding of love. I see the nature of relationships and family situations changing anyway. There will be no ‘norms’ and people will choose to live and love in many ways that will be considered shocking and outrageous today. They are nothing of the kind. Love is love is love. We will see the return of the extended family and less emphasis on the two parents and two children model of today. In other books I have likened what is happening to the Earth’s energy field to a bowl of water. If you wish to raise the level of the water from the bottom of the bowl to the top you have to turn on the tap. As you do this, the calmness in the water is disturbed and the more you turn on the tap, the more confusion, chaos, and turmoil is unleashed in the bowl. When you reach the top of the bowl and turn off the tap, the calmness quickly returns, but at a much higher level than before. If you see the water in this example as the Earth’s energy field and the tap as the energies coming in, you can see the potential for extreme effects. In Truth Vibrations, written in 1990, I passed on channelled predictions of the following themes in this decade and the next one: * Growing and often staggering extremes of weather and other natural disasters, including massive fires. * Gathering conflict all over the world to the point where the United Nations would be overwhelmed. * The collapse of the world economic system. * The rise of the political right. * The break up of the Soviet Union and other large countries and empires. * The end of the British monarchy, traditional politics and"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"251 institutions of state, and conventional economic and scientific thinking. * The collapse of the religious empires like the Roman Catholic Church and the rise of the religious right as a last desperate attempt to keep them going. * Record breaking earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, and general geological activity. * Time appearing to pass quicker every year. This is the effect of the quickening vibrations and the speeding up of ‘Cosmic time’. You can’t see this in the hands of the clock moving quicker, but you can feel it and there seems to be less time to do everything. These effects will have a dual cause. The brotherhood network will be trying to cause as much disruption as possible to stop the transformation, and hold back the Earth’s energy field so it cannot make its evolutionary leap and leave them behind. I feel they will be using their knowledge and technology to try to weaken the grid and stop the rise in fequency. They even have the technology to affect the weather, particular in smaller areas. The changes within the Earth’s energy field will also create many of these effects, but there is something we can do about that. The situation is this, quite simply. The further the energy field is from balance the more disruption will be caused by the re-balancing effects of the Photon Beam. So the more we, humanity, can help to create that balance the less traumatic this period will be in all things. The further you push down a pair of scales on one side, the more dramatic is the ‘kick back’ when they thrash around seeking balance. The principle is the same with the Earth’s energy field. The more we can generate the energy called love from our heart chakra for the Earth, people, and all forms of life, the more we will help the planet to balance out the negative. This will make less extreme the process of passing through the balancing beam. We all have the potential to do that, it only takes the will and a change of perception. You can make that change now if you wish. Love yourself; love your enemies, love the world. We are not alone. Other extra-terrestrial consciousness streams are working to help. But they will not impose themselves on our right to free will as the others do. We have to ask for their help. More than anything we need to help ourselves. We certainly need the support and love we can get because the Luciferic consciousness knows what is happening and the nature of the consciousness shift that is underway.

Open your hearts and fasten your seat beats."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"253 15 The Economics of Enough SPIRITUAL enlightenment is wonderful, but without a practical expression it can be overwhelmed by the forces of control. We not only have to think love, and think change, we have to live it, too. For instance, if we don’t challenge practically the ambitions of the Brotherhood, we are allowing the spiritual revolution, the Robots Rebellion, to be blocked. It is harder to rebel and think for yourself when you have a micro-chip inside you transmitting the Brotherhood’s message than when you are free from such interference. And those under such manipulation are hardly going to generate the love and understanding we urgently need. In the rest of the book I am going to outline some of the ways we can speed the spiritual revolution, and stop the brotherhood from stopping us. I will start with the economic system which the elite currently controls. Even with six billion people sharing this planet, it is still possible to provide for everyone’s need. What it is not possible to do, as Gandhi said, is to provide for everyone’s greed. The economic system which meets the wants of the few by denying the needs of the majority is in its twilight years. It is unsustainable environmentally, and even in its own primitive economic terms it has reached the end of the road. Don’t be kidded by those computer screens in the financial centres and the economists with their jargon and System-speak. They are programmed minds who mostly parrot the System’s line because they can’t raise their vision to see beyond it. This makes them easy fodder for the Illuminati elite to pursuade or bribe them to support ever greater centralisation. The present system isn’t working and so on the basis of ‘something must be done’ they promote more central control, like a World Central Bank. That changes nothing. It’s the same lunacy controlled by fewer people."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"254 The first thing we need to do is remove economic growth from our assessment of human and economic success. Gross Domestic Product is the figure that mesmerises and controls the policies of governments throughout the world. But GDP is meaningless. All it measures is the amount of money that changes hands for goods and services in any year. THAT IS IT. Economic growth is not a measurement of economic success, it is merely a measurement of economic activity. It is like measuring the success of a soccer team by the amount of running it does in a match rather than the number of goals it scores. Every time there is an environmental disaster caused by the pursuit of economic growth, the money spent on reacting to that disaster is added to economic growth because it is adding to economic activity; every time someone is ill and needs treatment it adds to GDP; the same when there is a war. The system of self- destruction takes the money made from growth and the money made from the consequences of growth, and instead of taking one from the other, it adds the two together. Staggering? Of course it is, but that is the system that controls your life and is dismantling the planet. Any system which uses the growth figure as its only measurement of national, human, and economic success must create a barely-one- dimensional world which reflects the nature of its economics. But then that is what the Brotherhood bankers want it to be. Any sane society, which ours is about to become, must have measurements of human progress that reflect the multidimensional beings that we are, such as: How few are in poverty? How few are homeless? How few are hungry? How few are lonely? How few are unhappy, dissatisfied, and unfulfilled? How few feel they are denied the opportunity to realise their full potential? How few feel their lives are controlled by others? These are some of the true indicators of human progress, and yet they are the very areas ignored by the present system, because those who control it wish to imprison the people, not set them free. For their system to survive it has to increase, not decrease, everything on that list. What is good for people is a disaster for the System. You will notice, too, that the measurements I have listed refer to ‘how"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"255 few?’. Today’s system measures success only in ‘how many?’ Increasing ‘throughput’ is all it can think 0£ The more units of activity it can produce, the more successful it claims to be. Question government ministers about health care provision and they will reply in justification of their policies: ‘We are treating more people than ever before’. But why? Why do so many need treatment? Surely success in health care should be measured by how few require treatment and how many people are healthy, not by how many are ill. The System sees rising house prices as a sign of economic success while thousands live in the street because they can’t afford a home. Surely success should be judged on how few people are homeless, and not by how much more it costs every year to buy a house. The whole throughput mentality is so ridiculous that you have transport ministers welcoming increased car sales (throughout), while at the same time complaining that they can’t afford to build all the new roads necessary to cope with the extra traffic. (A consequence of throughput.) The acceleration of human and industrial throughput will not solve the problems of the world. It is creating most of them. America has consumed more fossil fuels and minerals in the last 50 years than the rest of humanity combined in the whole of human history. If growth is the way to eliminate poverty, homelessness, hunger, and all the other human ills why hasn’t America managed to do it, despite consuming the planet on that suicidal scale? And what would happen to the Earth if every country sought to do the same? But that is exactly what they are being urged to do. Brotherhood-manipulated politicians and economists have even invented the impossible in their desperation to justify this and hide the realities. They now talk of ‘sustainable growth’ when there is no such thing. No growth is sustainable, because we live on a planet of finite size with a finite ability to take the punishment. Yet the journalists and interviewers never question them on this obvious contradiction. Greens are ridiculed for their policy of a no-growth economy. But what could be more sensible and efficient? That policy says there should be no growth and a significant annual decline in the rate we use natural ‘resources’. This reduces destructive throughput by getting more from less; by making things to last as long as technological knowledge will allow; by recycling waste back into the production process so reducing the need to take more from the planet; by insulating buildings to reduce the fuel required to keep"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"256 them warm; and by encouraging local production for local consumption to reduce the need for so much transportation and the trucks, motorways, etc. The list of ways we can get more from less through commonsense is endless. This would lead to a sustainable, steady state, economy in which no more is taken from the Earth than she can replenish and no more is thrown back at the Earth than she can safely absorb. In the future we will not need to take from the Earth at all for our fuels because there is no need to once you understand the nature of energy and how to harness it for warmth and power. The theory which seeks to justify growth as the way to remove suffering is called ‘trickle down.’ The belief is that if you allow the rich to exploit and become richer that will create the money at the top which will ‘trickle down’ in wages and services to provide income for those further down the economic scale. The same justification is applied to countries. If the rich get richer they will trade with the poor, and money will trickle down to them. The problem is that it doesn’t work and the brotherhood bankers know it doesn’t work. It is not supposed to. Most of the money stays near the top of the pyramid, because the closer you are to the top the more you get paid. Those at the bottom have to survive on the scraps that fall from the rich man’s table which, in a phrase, is what trickle down really is. At the bottom of the pyramid the majority of the people in the world struggle for, and often fail to find, even the basics of human existence. The world has had well over a century of rapid economic growth, and yet half the population of the planet is in relative or absolute poverty. Around a billion are in absolute poverty, the definition of which is ‘a condition of life so characterised by malnutrition, illiteracy, and disease as to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency’. But the growth-trickle-down fallacy has hypnotised all the political movements, the Greens apart. Ask a capitalist, communist, socialist, or liberal democrat for a way forward economically, and they will give you a version of take, make and throwaway based on trickle down. As the frequencies rise and consciousness expands, this illusion is being rejected by millions of people, and the numbers will grow at an ever-quickening rate. Even those who once dismissed or ignored the Green analysis are beginning to question openly the economic madness we are indoctrinated to worship. The billionaire financier, James Goldsmith, said this in the London Times:"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"257 “Economic growth is the way to measure success, and science and technology are its principal tools. This is the basis of modern thought, but I question it. The leading modern society, America, has produced the greatest surge in economic growth and material prosperity in history. In the past fifty years its gross domestic product (GDP) has grown in constant, inflation-adjusted dollars, from $1.5 trillion to $5.9 trillion. American science and technology have achieved incredible innovations. And yet, American society is deeply ill.” There will still be the brotherhood fodder who try to retain and justify all that I have described, because they believe it is best for them personally, or they are closing their minds to the changing consciousness. But trying to prop up this economic insanity will be like trying to plug holes in a crumbling dyke. For every leak you manage to repair temporarily, another dozen will be sprung, until the entire dyke is washed away. The economic system has to go, and we have to stop cooperating with it. What we must be aware of is an engineered collapse of the global economy by the brotherhood with the intention of introducing a WorJd Central Bank pledged to rebuild it. This is their intention and while no-one wants the System to be dismantled more than me, we must resist centralisation and use the collapse to de-link from the System. We can expect a crash on the global stock markets which the Brotherhood would have no trouble instigating and that will send the System into free fall. Insurance companies faced with more claims through crime and natural disasters, and fewer people who can afford the rising premiums are already feeling the walls of change closing in. Add to this the financial implications of changing attitudes to life, the weather extremes, and geological events, and you can see the days are numbered for the economics of the madhouse. The only danger, as I keep stressing, is if we allow the collapse to justify further centralisation. If that happens the System will be rebuilt with even more control. So what can we do? I can’t say exactly what will happen, because no-one knows in detail what the future will bring or how humanity will use its free will to react. But if we are to end the power of an economic elite we need to move from the big to the small; from central control to community and individual control; from humans serving technology"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"258 to technology serving humans. Awakening people are demanding these changes and they will be necessary anyway when the world economic order is holed below the water line and sinks. There is going to be a great deal of reacting to events and we will have to move very quickly. We will see that we all depend on each other, and community spirit is going to return in a very big way. Throughout the Industrial era, the trends have been in the other direction. Financial power has been concentrated in fewer and fewer hands by the cost of installing mass producing technology and the need to compete with other countries. This has been the bankers’ doing. We have seen community businesses fail in the face of unfair, market-rigged, competition from the major banks and corporations, all of which are Brotherhood controlled. National companies have grown through this economic injustice to become multi-nationals which wield enormous power around the world. Many of them have a bigger turnover every year than scores of countries, and that gives them the muscle to exploit those countries and even govern them from behind the scenes. This brings about the grotesque sight of food growing land in poor countries being used to grow luxury crops for the rich. This is often at the instigation of Brotherhood multi-national corporations and corrupt politicians. In my book It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, there is a chapter entitled ‘Empty Bellies and Chocolate Bars’. It is so called because according to Oxfam well over half the children in Ghana are malnourished, while half the food growing land in Ghana is growing cocoa for the western chocolate industry. Another statistic I used in that book was that 400,000 children are reckoned to die in Brazil every year from hunger-related disease when Brazil is one of the biggest exporters of food in the world. While those children live and die in poverty, the land that could feed them is used to increase the profits of multi-nationals and the rich world in general. This manipulation of trade and debt by the West has led to the almost unbelievable situation in which more money passes from poor countries to rich every year than goes the other way. Remember that next time you see Western politicians talking about the ‘aid’ they are sending to the poor, or when you hear people criticise such aid because ‘charity begins at home.’ No it doesn’t. Exploitation begins at home and is exported across the world. In the new tomorrow the word charity will be used only in accounts of human history. There will be giving and receiving, but there will be no dependence and"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"259 therefore no ‘charity’. Charity exists today only because exploitation and manipulated dependency has created the need for it. The System controls us through dependencE. It makes us dependent upon it for all the necessities of life, food, clothing, warmth, and shelter. That has been its Lucifer-inspired ambition, and it has largely succeeded. This dependence on essentials means that we have to play the System’s game or we won’t survive. The first priority of any new economics must be to reduce and then remove dependence on the System for those things. Once you have adequate food, clothing, warmth, and shelter, you immediately have choices. You no longer have to do what the System wants you to do. Removing dependence requires the dismantling of centralised power in all areas of our lives. Economically and politically it means small, not big, is beautiful. The emphasis will be on communities coming together to supply their own needs, and not being dependent on a system over which they have no control. It has become so silly that if someone starts a rumour on the Tokyo stockmarket to make a financial killing, the knock-on effect can have consequences for the lives of people living on the other side of the planet. Self-reliance and self-sufficiency in all essentials will be the basic model of future economics, because that decreases dependence and gives power back to people. In this view of economics, the people of Ghana will be fed by food grown on their own land. The needs of their people will be served first, and not those of the multi-national chocolate factories. Poorer countries have been persuaded and manipulated to believe that the best way for them to ‘succeed’ is to use their land to grow cash crops for the Western multi-nationals and to use that money to import food from the West. This means the West can’t lose. It can make the chocolate products to sell back to places like Ghana at a profit, and also sells food to them. Even better, it controls the price of both the cash crops it imports from those countries and the products and food it exports to them, because the West controls the financial system. Or the Brotherhood does. The countries of the Third World know that if they refuse to accept this injustice, the multi-nationals will move elsewhere as they play off one poor country against another. The way out of this bind of control through dependence is to produce the essentials locally whenever possible and local production for local need will be forced upon us anyway by weather, geological, political and economic upheavals. The only effective response to all this will"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"260 come locally. Look at the chaos that one snow storm, hurricane, or period of heavy rain can cause. Imagine what will happen as all that increases. We are going to see just how tenuous is our modern, technological, world when faced with the realities and power of nature. The GATT agreement which is designed to open up the world to ever greater competition by removing import barriers is the Illuminati elite at work again. If you want to create dependency on the System for all the countries of the world, the myth of free trade has had to be sold and conditioned into people because without ‘free’ trade the strong could no longer exploit the weak on anything like the same scale. The truth is that trade has never been free in modern society. It is a licence to exploit the weak. The GATT agreement is an effort by the elite to create more control and dependence. Those politicians and economists who can’t see the real agenda promoted GATT in a desperate attempt to find more places to sell products and generate ‘growth’. But of course there are still only so many people and so much money, and for everyone who sells more as a result of this agreement someone else must sell less. The ones that sell more will be those who sell cheapest, and they will be the ones prepared to exploit people and the planet more than the opposition. For every winner there must be even more losers. We have turned trade and economics into a sporting contest, a sort of Economic Olympics. We talk of ‘Japan pulling ahead’ or ‘Korea coming through fast’ while most of the world never even gets to the stadium. Events will unfold, I believe, that will reduce the production of oil, the cocaine of the System. It is addicted to oil and only survives by consuming and pricing it at levels which do not reflect the reality that it is finite and has fantastic environmental costs. Take away oil and there is basically no System. If this happens it will bring an end to the ridiculous situation in which one country exports a product to the other side of the world while importing back across the world that country’s version of the same product. It is justified in the name of ‘choice’, but what is this choice? The choice of having ten, twenty, a hundred different shampoos to buy, all of which do the same basic job with the same basic ingredients? What about the choice denied to people of going out in the sunshine at certain times of the year because a system that speaks of ‘choice’ has so damaged the ozone layer that skin cancer is becoming an epidemic in some areas? Do"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"261 you know that products are often transported from country to country with each one adding another component because that’s the cheapest way for multi-nationals to produce them? Our ports and airports are full of ships and planes using fuel and resources and causing untold pollution when most of it is unnecessary. It serves no-one except multinational corporations and the bankers. Far from supplying needs and ‘choice’ it is actually denying both to the majority. In the years ahead, countries and communities are going to be more concerned with supplying their own necessities than exporting their production across the planet. This will unlock so much creativity. If the economic system is the way people are controlled and pressured to conform, think what opportunities await us as it collapses or we de-link ourselves from it and those pressures are removed. The Chinese word for crisis, wei-chi, means both danger and opportunity. While the fall of the System may be seen as a danger to us, it is really an opportunity to unleash all the infinite power of human ingenuity. This has been imprisoned by a system in which thinking is the last thing it wants us to do. Orders are issued from above by the few and the majority do as they are told. They are not asked their opinion, they are treated like robots. If you want to find the best way of doing something you don’t ask a manager in an office, you ask those who do the job day after day. But those people are rarely consulted. In the future there will be no ‘us’ and ‘them’, no orders from above. Those who currently impose their view on others are going to be in the same boat as everyone else as the Robots’ Rebellion gathers pace. The economic disintegration caused by a variety of reasons will give us a blank sheet of paper on which to start again. The quickening frequencies are triggering within us the desire for control over our own lives. This is leading us towards smaller economic units and a wish to withdraw ourselves from the present system as much as we can. The necessities of providing for need in the wake of the collapse will demand the same course of action. In the transition period at least, the emphasis will be on barter goods and services in exchange for goods and services with often little or no money changing hands. This expansion of barter is happening today. People who are awakening are using it to step out of the System as much as they can and as unemployment rises millions are seeing that the System can no longer provide for them and their"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"262 families and has no prospect of doing so. This approach is going to be vital, as social security payments are squeezed and used to turn people into little more than slaves to the State. When I wrote It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, which was published in 1990, I highlighted a barter system called LETS. At the time I could find only three examples of this at work in England, Today, only a few years later, there are countless LETS Systems in action. LETS is short for Local Employment and Trade System and it overcomes the limitations of money. Under the present economic order, money is everything. In a recession when money is tight, skills are locked within people. The money is not there to pay them for their skills and allow them to pay others for theirs. Many of the needs of people and their communities go unmet when the skills are there to provide them. LETS releases those skills. It works like this: You invent a currency. The name doesn’t matter because it doesn’t actually exist in physical form. They are just imaginary units of exchange. When you join a LETS group, you are given a list of all the skills and contributions being offered by the other members. You write down a list of all the things that you can do. It can be anything from baby sitting to repairing a house. If there is something you need that a member of the group can provide, you contact them and agree a price in your unit of currency. On the Isle of Wight where I live, one group has called their currency ‘Wights’ and that is the name I will use here, but it could be anything. Let us say that you contact a car mechanic in the group and you agree a price of 50 Wights for him or her to repair your car. When the job is done, you ring the LETS coordinator and you say ‘credit so and so with 50 Wights and debit my account with the same.’ The mechanic now has fifty units which he or she can use to purchase your skills or anyone else’s in the group and you have committed yourself to giving 50 units worth of work to the group also. No money has changed hands, but you have your car repaired and the mechanic will be paid in whatever services he or she might need. It may be that, for the moment, some money has to be spent on items purchased within the System, perhaps some spark plugs or engine parts in this case, but in some LETS groups even shops are offering food and goods in exchange or part exchange for barter in this way. You can take it further and have each member commit themselves to so many units of work a month for those in the community who cannot contribute through illness or infirmity. But there are very few"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"263 who cannot offer something. One way of running LETS is to have a rate per hour for everyone so all time is measured equally. You can start now, the sooner the better, to build a community economy as independent as possible from the world system. The more we can live outside of that system, the more the power of the Brotherhood Bankers is reduced. Put an advertisement in the paper and call a public meeting or just gather a few friends around who you think might be interested. There might already be a LETS in your area which you can join. There are no rules that must be obeyed. Each group works out what is best for them and learns with experience how best to proceed. These LETS groups can grow quite large, but it is best to keep them to manageable numbers. It is important to have them up and running as soon as possible to reduce dependency on the Brotherhood and to limit the chaos and suffering when the present system collapses. In the new peoples’ economics we will need local cooperatives and community-owned companies for food distribution. It is simply daft for food to be grown in one area and sent long distances to other communities while those communities send their produce in the other direction. Food cooperatives will have the role ofcollectmg the food from local farmers and growers and distributing this to the local shops and markets. To be truly responsive to local needs, these cooperatives should be controlled by representatives of ALL the community, not only the farmers and growers. We will require community organisations, again with all views and needs represented, to coordinate the production and distribution of the necessities of life to everyone in their community. Their brief will be to ensure that no-one goes without food, warmth, clothing, and shelter. This can be provided much more quickly and efficiently by local communities once they can control their own lives and be freed from the barriers presented by the current system to any form of activity which operates independently of its structure. These community economic cooperatives will also have the role of identifying the goods and produce imported into a community which could be produced locally. They will then seek ways to replace the imports with local production. There can be local currencies to work alongside barter and community banks will be developed to channel local money into the local economy. These banks should not make money out of money, only cover their costs. If we are going to bring in the changes to ensure that economics serves people, the System of"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"264 making money out of money must end. To type in numbers on a computer screen and then charge interest for lending money that doesn’t exist has to stop if the control is going to stop. Money should be a form of exchange and a measurement of productive activities and not a way of increasing your wealth for doing nothing. This ethos has turned the global economy into a giant casino with the table rigged against all, but the few. I am not suggesting that communities cut themselves off from each other in the local economies. Quite the opposite. There will still be trade where possible, but it will be for the mutual and equal benefit of both communities involved and largely based on an exchange system of barter rather than a financial transaction. I do not see trade in necessities except where one community cannot provide them for itself. As you will see in the next chapter I am saying that we need closer links between communities not an intensification of division. But why does unnecessary and destructive economic activity which makes all communities dependent on outside forces have to be a basis for cooperating with each other? Surely the fierce competition between communities such a system creates discourages the very cooperation we wish to see. It is time for people of all backgrounds, creeds, colours, and views to come together and cooperate for the good of the whole and not compete for the good of the few. I can recommend a book called After The Crash by Guy Dauncey (Green Print) which offers lots of advice and examples of how to build a local economy in which people can free themselves from the clutches of national and international control. Don’t let anyone tell you this isn’t possible. It is, and it is happening now. Local production for local need is the direction in which we are being guided by changing consciousness and economic necessity. We will also realise from these experiences that we have been indoctrinated to accept a perverted view of efficiency. We have been sold the line that says if you centralise your production you can produce things cheaper. This might be true in a few cases, but not the majority. Most of these products are only cheaper in the shops because they do not reflect the full cost of producing and distributing them. Let me give you an idea of what I mean. If something is made or grown locally and sold as near as possible to where it is produced, the price will reflect virtually the full cost of production and distribution. Not all of it, but most of it. That is not"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"265 the case with centralised production. When you centralise you need massive trucks to deliver those products. You need millions of them and they must get bigger and more destructive as the centralisation intensifies. They consume fossil fuels at a breathtaking rate with the trucks capable of less than ten miles to the gallon. To cope with these trucks we have to build more motorways and by-passes at incredible cost. We have to spend money repairing the motorways and roads, the water and gas pipes, buildings, and pavements, all damaged by the ever increasing weight of the trucks. We have to pay in medical costs for the growth in road accidents and ill health caused by pollution and the stress of living alongside roads full of traffic and trucks which shake your home and deny you peace and quiet. We have to spend more on the welfare system, because people-based businesses which served their local communities have been closed down by machine- based giants who largely serve only their shareholders and profit margins. Financial speculation, not human need, dominates industry - just as the Illuminati Protocols said it would. None of these costs I have listed are reflected in the price of the products that are produced in this way. You pay for them once at the shop and again in your taxes, while the costs in environmental destruction are not even acknowledged. They are passed on to future generations which, through reincarnation, could be us! All this creates an illusion of efficiency which has hoodwinked billions of people into accepting centralisation as ‘progress’. When those costs have to be reflected in the price on the shelf local production will often be shown to be cheaper, especially the essentials like food. Packaged and factory-prepared food is far more expensive than buying fresh food locally and preparing it yourself. The national and multi-national food conglomerates have to find ways of taking a potato or a carrot and adding as much to its value as they can. They do this by turning out processed, conveyor belt, ‘convenience’ food in the form of crisps or pies or whatever. And because food produced in this way has to travel long distances before being eaten, chemicals and preservatives have to be added which increase the cost of the medical services by the affect they have on the human body. This is on top of the poisons the food already contains as a consequence of chemical-based farming methods. The food giants can ensure big profits from what started out as a potato or vegetable costing only a few pennies. We will see the return of buying fresh food locally and preparing it at home at a much cheaper cost in the years ahead."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"266 The centralisation of production and political control have brought about the death of community. The System’s policy of divide and rule has destroyed so much community spirit, cooperation and local self- reliance. Local post offices and small shops have closed. So have local schools and children have to be bussed out of their community to the big, often impersonal, centralised schools. Their parents have also had to travel longer distances to work as centralisation has closed local firms and created the need for mass commuting with all the road, public transport, and pollution costs that entails. People are forced to begin and end each working day in traffic jams or crowded trains alongside others in the same situation. More of their time is taken by working and travelling, and less is available for families, friends, and life in the community. Governments talk of the need for ‘family values’ while promoting a system that breaks up families for most of every day, and creates pressures that many relationships do not survive. More people are now realising that if you can reduce your number of ‘wants’, you need less money to live. Simplifying your life like this can free those most precious of gifts - time and choice. Yet another consequence of centralisation has been the dependence of communities on one or very few companies for their economic stability. When those industries falter or the companies decide it is better for them to centralise elsewhere, the communities are devastated because their economic base is so small and dependent on so few. Community economies of the kind that will evolve in the years ahead will not suffer from such lack of diversity. The multi-nationals who use their power to exploit people and the planet will not survive the transformation. The expansion of consciousness will ensure that their days will pass. Business will go through a fundamental reassessment of values and motivations, because the evolution of consciousness is not limited to the weak and the poor. It is touching everyone who is prepared to open their mind and go with the gathering flow. I wish to emphasise again that in my critique of the economic system I am not condemning or judging people. I am challenging the thought patterns that control the people who serve the System. Managing directors living their lives under the daily and growing pressures of serving balance sheets and growth figures are as much victims of this madness as those they employ, or don’t employ, on the factory floor. With every day, more of the ‘winners’ are finding their work"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"267 unfulfilling and without meaning. Their true selves are rising to the surface and new views and values are entering their consciousness. As this continues, they will be asking many questions they have never asked before. These questions will include: What is my business really here for? What are we really here for? Is it merely to accumulate money as fast as possible? Is that all that life is about? Are we here to be terrified of not selling more things every year? I know that many business executives are already asking these questions and they are realising that they are victims also. The new business that will emerge from the ashes of the old will be there to serve rather than exploit and it will judge its success by these criteria: (1) Is the process of producing, distributing, and selling the product damaging in any way to the planet and the natural life support systems? (2) Is the business exploiting the world rather than making a contribution to healing the world, serving human need, and making it a better place for all people and life-forms? (3) Is the business harming or exploiting animals mentally, emotionally or physically and causing them pain and stress of any kind? (4) Is the business exploiting people to maximise profits? Is it paying them less than their work is worth because I can use my economic power to make them accept whatever they are offered? Am I exploiting my suppliers or weaker countries and peoples by abusing my economic power over them? (5) For the business to win, does it require that other people or countries must lose? (6) Do those working in the business feel a part of the decision making process and empowered to release their full creativity, or do they feel their creativity has to conform to some rigid corporate structure in which the maximisation of profit is the only driving force? If the answer to any of those questions is ‘yes’ we are looking at a business that is going to be submerged in the changing consciousness in the collective mind of the human race. The new business will seek to ensure that economic activity leads to everyone winning from any situation and that includes the Earth. We are moving from win4ose economics to win-win economics. The new business will have no rigid structures. Instead it will evolve its ways of working and"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"268 operation from foundation values like caring, sharing, compassion, environmental responsibility, love in its widest sense, peace, harmony, truth, justice, and respect. From these principles each business will evolve in ways that best suit its community and the people involved. Diversity and variety will replace the centralised uniformity of today. You can go to almost any city in the world and see the same names and shop fronts, all co-ordinated by some centralised multi-national corporation. One culture created in the United States is being imposed upon the whole of humanity with the bulk of the profits going back to head office at the expense of the local people and their indigenous culture. The kind of changes that I am describing will put a stop to this cancerous expansion. An executive from a multi-national fashion corporation told me that he was already seeing this rejection of uniform ity showing itself in their sales figures. They could no longer sell one design all over the world. People were looking for individual designs that allowed them to express their individuality. It may appear to be a contradiction, but the move towards an understanding of the Oneness of all consciousness will lead to a desire by people to express themselves in ways that emphasise the infinite variety within that Whole. The re-balancing of the planet is happening on all levels and affecting all things. The re-connection of lower and higher self will lead to a rebalancing of economics and business practice. Those who try to continue with the old methods and motivations will find themselves struggling to sell their products. The System has been created to appeal to the five physical senses. Products and advertising have been geared to this and the five senses have largely made the decision on what and where to buy. Now other senses are coming into play. These are the higher senses that work through the intuition. They are often referred to in every day conversation as a ‘sixth sense’, although there are many levels of them. These are becoming more influential in decision-making as people awaken. Everything is energy and absorbs energy. The energy in a production process is transferred to the product and that energy, consciousness, will reflect the intent behind the product. If the intent is only to make as much money as possible, the product will carry that thought pattern. If the production involves environmental degradation, that, too, will be in the energy field of the product. This has not really mattered to companies so far because the five"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"269 senses do not relate directly to that energy field of the product. They relate to its feel, smell, taste, look or sound. But as growing millions become more sensitive to higher levels of themselves, they will be tuning into the energy fields of everything and everyone -.including products in the shops. They will sense on these intuitive levels the intent behind a product. They won’t be saying: ‘Oh I’ll buy this pair of jeans because I can sense that the intent of the company is to serve, not exploit’. They will simply pick one product and not another because their intuition will encourage them to do so. They won’t know why they are choosing that product. They will just do it. This will mean big trouble for those companies which produce with negative intent and they will be racking their brains trying to work out why people are rejecting their goods when there appears to be no explainable reason why this should suddenly be so. There will be two stages in the transformation of economics and business. The first stage will be the acceleration in the break down of the old and the attempts by the brotherhood to use that situation to bring in their World Central Bank and one currency. From the chaos that will follow this period, the new will emerge. There will be a great deal of ad-libbing and reacting to events. It will be a time when barter will be essential and we will have to help each other on the basis of need. New technologies will be discovered which I will talk about later which will transform our lives. This technology will give us all the power and warmth we need without touching or harming the physical Earth - and it is technology that already exists. The second stage will see the consolidation of the new economics and technologies as the old fades to become history. As the decades of the next century come and go and the frequencies go on rising, humanity will build a new world of amazing and wondrous potential. What we would call miracles will be as much a part of every day life as take, make, and throwaway is today. I cannot stress enough the importance of distinguishing between the transition period and the world that will follow. Yes, of course, there will be traumatic times. This always happens when one era is replaced rapidly by another. I can see shortages of food perhaps and much upheaval. But the transformation to a higher consciousness is not leading us back to caves, hardship and struggle. If you want a system that brings hardship and struggle, then stick with the present one. That delivers both with unwavering efficiency. The transformation is guiding us to an era of abundance in the next"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"270 century. When the destructive ways have been replaced and the Brotherhood’s control dismantled, the Earth will be abundant in her gifts of food and beauty. Love will replace hate and cooperation will replace competition. The present system does not want abundance. Its power is in scarcity. That increases the price, the profit, and the ability to control. We will see that life is meant to be a joy. We are not here to be victims and it wasn’t supposed to be like this. Deep down beneath the layers of conditioning, the robots know this is true and the memories of that truth are beginning to stir within the hearts of those who have the will and the vision to think for themselves. Knowledge and understanding is starting to surface and the robots are rebelling. Not everyone will make that choice, perhaps the majority will not. But many will and they will change the world. Change and necessity shall free all our pent-up, locked-up, creativity, love, and passion for living. We will see human nature in its fullest and most glorious expression. We will discover potential within us that we never believed possible. Humans are not sinners who must find Jesus to be ‘saved’. We have been misguided and misdirected by a disconnection from our true selves, that’s all. The re-connection into Wholeness will bring a transformation of outlook and values that will rid this planet of the ills that currently overwhelm human consciousness. It will also wrest control from the forces that seek to destroy. All is thought and thought is all. Nothing happens in the physical world which has not been preceded by a thought. Physical actions are manifestations of thought. If thought is imbalanced and destructive so will be the physical world. If thought is balanced, loving, and constructive, that is the society that will emerge. We create our own reality, and that is why vision is so important. The greater the vision the greater the reality. The old vision had money, production, and exploitation as its focus. That is the reality it has created. The new vision is about respect and love for all life and all that is creation. This is the world that is soon to be."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"271 16 The Politics of People ONE of the greatest myths known to the human race is that politicians have power. It is simply not true. How can 365 members of Parliament in Britain have power over a population of some 57 million? Or a President have power over 250 million Americans? They can’t. Their only power is in persuading us that they have power. Like everything on this physical level, it is an illusion. I mentioned earlier that towards the end of British rule in India, Gandhi told the colonial government, ‘100,000 Englishmen cannot control 300 million Indians if those Indians will not cooperate’. In that one sentence you can see where the real power lies. It lies with us, the mass of the people, and not with governments, armies, industrial conglomerates, or the Brotherhood. They only appear to have power because of the apathy and indoctrination of the robots. Once enough robots wake up and rebel we will see what a sleight of hand this business of ‘power’ really is. I feel for politicians. In many ways, they are the biggest victims, the most programmed of robotic beings. They change nothing which is not acceptable to the system. The economic madness which they have helped to unleash across the world has imprisoned them and their successors. They are no more free to act on fundamental issues than a prisoner in Dartmoor or San Quentin. At election time, they have to tell people what they believe enough of them want to hear. If they don’t do that, they don’t get elected. And what do most people want to hear from their politicians? What the system has indoctrinated them to demand. More growth, possessions, money and economic ‘success’ for their country. Politicians are pawns being moved around a board by the Brotherhood, a programmed population and the interdependency the system has constructed. Politicians cannot act independently in one country because they are linked to a system which insists that they"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"272 play by its rules. If they seek to limit imports of unnecessary goods which their country is capable of making for itself; others immediately take action to block their country’s exports. Even those politicians who have seen the system for what it is - and there are painfully few - would recoil at the prospect of taking any action that would bring with it a chaotic but vital period of transition while their economy was recovering from the colossal blow of losing export revenue and redirecting itself into producing the goods it had been importing until then. Any government which tried to do this would be overthrown either democratically or by force. The System has the politicians slavishly serving its wishes through manipulation, indoctrination and fear. They will never take the action necessary to free humanity from its imprisonment or the planet from her punishment. Only by the system’s collapse and its replacement by another way of thinking can we be freed from our dependency and be able to step into an era of economic sanity. Essential to this is an end to politics as we know it. Representatives of the people are there to serve those people, not their party or self- interest. It is such an insult to the word democracy to see politicians allowing themselves to be used like fodder to vote in Congress, the House of Commons and the other parliaments of the world in whatever way their party leaders tell them. They are the prisoners of the Whip system. The Whips are party officials who are there to ensure that the Members of Parliament which the population has elected follow the wishes of their party and never the urgings of their conscience or what they believe are the needs of the people. Parliaments are, appropriately, microcosms of the whole system. You have the few at the top like the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, or the President and his advisors, who try to force their Members of Parliament or Congress to toe their line. They, in turn, most of them without realising it, serve the non-elected Brotherhood above them. Political leaders often talk of the need for people to show self responsibility, but they are the last ones who want to see any such thing - especially in their own party. When MPs take responsibility for their own thoughts and vote with their beliefs, they are ‘disciplined’ by their party and told they will never be considered for promotion. This is democracy? I remember when I was a national speaker for the British Green Party, the Conservative Government introduced a Poll Tax which was"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"273 deeply unfair in that it asked the poor to pay the same as the rich. The strength of the protests and a campaign of non-payment forced the Government to scrap it (people power again). At the time, the Environment Secretary vehemently supported the tax and condemned those who challenged its unfairness. It was he who guided the bill through parliament to bring the Poll Tax into law. Some years later, that same man was interviewed on a programme looking back at the years of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister. He said he had always believed the Poll Tax was unworkable and should never have been introduced. He had, he claimed, even said this to Margaret Thatcher before he had agreed to introduce it. On the same programme, the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Poll Tax said that he, too, had told Mrs Thatcher it was a ridiculous idea. The film cut from him to archive footage of Margaret Thatcher proclaiming the Poll Tax at a Conservative Party Conference. Sitting close by and clapping all that she said was that same Chancellor of the Exchequer who, in private, was saying it should never be introduced. Stories like that and much, much, worse could be repeated many times in parliaments all over the world. Let us not avoid the issue here. The political system and the economic system are one and the same. They are indivisible. Both are sick, corrupt, stupid, selfdestructing and Brotherhood-controlled. Like the economic order, the political circus has created mechanisms and structures for turning out the robots and clones it needs to survive. Unless you are a system-serving, toe-the-liner, you will struggle to be selected to represent a major party in an election. Some people with a mind of their own slip through this net, but they are so few they can be muzzled or made impotent even if they are elected. The attitudes to life you need to become an MP or a Senator are mostly the opposite of what is required for honest, fair and inspired government. “The political has nothing in common with the moral. The ruler who is governed by the moral is not a skilled politician and is therefore unstable on his throne. He who wishes to rule must have recourse to both cunning and to make believe. Great national qualities like frankness and honesty are vices in politics, for they bring down rulers from their thrones more effectively and more certainly than the most powerful enemy.” (Illuminati Protocol 1). Like the economic system, politics has become ever more"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"274 centralised through this century. British local government has had responsibilities and decision-making on many issues removed by Westminster; and Westminster is surrendering responsibilities to the European Community. Others have done the same. It is all leading towards the Brotherhood dream of a World Government and I even hear some intelligent, caring people supporting the idea, often from the best of intentions. I say again and again... NO,NO NO. As with most changes that give power to the few, it can be presented as highly desirable. If we had a World Government, they say, we could stop this or stop that, do this, or do that. Others believe that the move towards World Government is a natural part of our evolution and journey towards wholeness. We started in tribes and communities, this way of thinking suggests, and we are evolving through national and continental government to World Government. I challenge this view. World cooperation and World Government are not the same thing. Does anyone really think that a World Government convened under the present system is going to be any less sick, corrupt, stupid and self-destructive than national or international governments? Of course not. But we are not looking here at a government that has the potential to inflict all these things on a single country. We are talking about the world. Both sides of the left-right political spectrum have those who support the idea, but then, as with most things, the idea of left and right is another illusion. They are different aspects of the same bubble of unreality - and manipulation. The Brotherhood does not have a political line. It will use anyone or anything for its own ends. In its ranks and under its influence are politicians of all kinds and persuasions. The Communists and the capitalists speak the same language. Communism is merely a more authoritarian form of capitalism, anyway. Politicians, even the high-ranking ones, are mere front men and women compared with those working behind the scenes. President Reagan was an excellent example of this. He fired the bullets, but others loaded the gun. Imagine what control could be gifted to a tiny group of people if World Government became a reality. It would have nothing to do with the evolution to wholeness and everything to do with controlling the lives of six billion people. The way to avoid this is to pass decision-making and control down the line to people and communities and not to create the final rung on the ladder to world domination. We should demand this and refuse to cooperate with the present system."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"275 Look at examples of how global political-economic organisations, already in existence, have behaved. Those Brotherhood creations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, are there to make sure the system is served under all circumstances. When Third World countries begin to struggle to pay back debts to the rich, in goes the IMF to lend them yet more money that doesn’t exist and which they will not be able to repay. In return for this ‘help’, the IMF insists on measures to cut back on spending on the poor, healthcare, education and food subsidies. This brings more pain and suffering for the population. They also insist that those countries increase their exports to raise money. More food-growing land goes under cash crop production. But, with the IMF telling scores of countries to do this, the market is flooded with certain commodities or goods and the price collapses. They are all exporting more, but earning less. Who wins? The West. It has to pay less for its imports. The World Bank (not to be confused with a World Central Bank) is supposed to invest in projects to help the poorer countries. Instead, it has been responsible for investment in Third World countries that have destroyed their environment, put local farmers out of business and made western companies richer at the expense of the very country the bank was supposed to be assisting. If economic control is to be devolved to communities, political decision-making must be similarly devolved. This will be resisted by national and international governments. They will be desperate to maintain their control and this is another reason why the economic crash is necessary. Take economics out of national and international governments and there is little left for them to do under the present order. These governments are, in effect, only stewards of the world economic system on behalf of the banking elite. No-one is going to take any notice of them when the priority for everyone is the provision of essentials after the crash. They will be politicians with no-one to govern. The breakdown of the old can only lead to a return to local decision-making, if we reject the Brotherhood plans. There will be no other way to cope and react successfully to what will need to be done. Eventually we will see the end of political parties. They are the product of a divided humanity and have no place in the new tomorrow. Like all ‘isms’ they insist that their members serve the ism first and their hearts and conscience second. They battle for power by offering the same basic policies presented in slightly different"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"276 languages but, the Greens apart, they all serve the system and their members serve them. Indeed, some elements of Green politics are also system-serving without realising it. Political parties have also added to the confrontational nature of politics which mirrors the lack of cooperation that pervades the entire system. Politicians, in general, have sought office to achieve power. They want absolute power to impose their views upon the population. They will deny this but that is what they want, collectively. The electoral system in Britain gives control of decision-making to parties which considerably less than half the population have voted for. This is all old age nonsense. Politicians should be there to empower people. The key words are enable, allow and respect. To enable people to realise their full potential and follow their own instincts; to allow people to do whatever they wish and live in any way they choose as long as it does not cause harm to others; and to respect the rights of all people to control their own lives and make their own choices. The representative is a servant, not a dictator. Modern politics has got the two mixed up. From these principles, communities will decide on a system of representation that suits them. There will be no imposition of rigid structures by national and international governments once the transformation is well under way. Communities will be in control. I see elected representation as only part of community action. With the new consciousness, cooperating will come naturally without the need for laws and regulations of the kind we have so many of today. The world is drowning in laws and legislation because of the desire to control people and in response to the negative behaviour of those disconnected from their true selves. Representation will evolve with rising consciousness and in reaction to the collapse of the old structures. But, here are a few ideas which are likely to play some part in the new politics in the post-Brotherhood world: * I think we will see Neighbourhood Councils representing groups of houses and streets. If someone is lonely or hungry or in any sort of need, it will be the role of the Neighbourhood Council to take the necessary action. They will not ring Social Services because Social Services won’t exist in the way that it does today. Everything will be on a smaller, community scale. The explosion in the Welfare State and Social Services has been a reaction to the collapse of community. Now that the Brotherhood elite have largely achieved that, they will seek to squeeze the welfare services. Neighbourhood Councils will"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"277 alert the people of their area as to what needs to be done and will sort it out themselves, whenever possible. You could set up a Neighbourhood Council where you live, today. Through this, you could co-ordinate the care of the people in your area by the people in your area. There is no need to wait for the crash. It is a tragedy that so many do not even know who lives in the flat next door, let alone at the end of the street. Centralisation and the system of divide and rule, have brought this about. It is time to change this but it will not be easy. It will take commitment and there will be many people who fear participation because they have been programmed to believe that they are here to follow, not to lead. But, these changes will happen because circumstances and awakening consciousness will demand them. The more we can de4ink from the system now and prepare the groundwork for community organisation, the smoother the transition will be. * Neighbourhood Councils will have a representative on the Community Council. How big an area these Community Councils will cover will be decided by the people involved, in consultation with other communities around them. I would see elected Community Councils working alongside community forums. These forums would be open to everyone to present their views and suggestions for ways of improving the community. They would allow the knowledge and ingenuity of people to be given a hearing. Today, we have professional politicians making decisions about subjects they know little or nothing about. Those who are close to these subjects are never asked to speak in the debates or to offer their insight into problems which they work with every day. Giving people that opportunity in the present system of centralised control is almost impossible because there are too many people involved. But, in a community situation, that would not be the case. Everything would take place on a human scale. Even now, under the present system, there is no reason why community forums could not be organised to give a platform for local views and action. Indeed, this is happening as awakening people follow their instincts. The elected Community Council would attend these regular forums and listen to the people they represent. The councils would consist of people elected from right across society. Besides representatives from each neighbourhood there would be the opportunity for all sections of society to have an elected spokesperson -food producers,"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"278 shopkeepers, employees, environmental groups, young people, old people, and so on. I would suggest a similar dual approach to economic organisation. Elected representatives to a community economic cooperative would coordinate the day-to-day organisation and development of the community economy while an economic forum would allow everyone to contribute to the discussions on economic matters. People are much more enthusiastic and motivated when they know they have the opportunity to contribute and make a difference. You will be amazed at how many apparently insuperable problems can be solved once human ingenuity is harnessed to its full potential. The task for these community economies in the transition period will be to provide food, shelter, warmth and clothing for everyone and to do it in ways that are environmentally sustainable. * I would see the main roles of Regional Government to be the following: To support the communities in their efforts to be self- reliant in all essentials; to ensure that essentials which cannot be provided locally are provided from surpluses in other communities; to coordinate necessary trade between communities to the mutual benefit of both; to be a forum for communities to exchange information and experiences; to pass on details of new discoveries and technology which would benefit communities and add to their self reliance; to arbitrate in disagreements between communities; and to ensure that the actions of one community do not adversely affect another, either economically or environmentally. The regional level will be particularly important in the transition period in organising food distribution to the big urban areas which do not have enough food-growing land to feed themselves. * I do not believe the present national governments, as such, will be necessary, although groups of regions may choose to get together to support each other. The next level of representation after regional could be continental. These would be areas covered today by the European Community or the United States and Canada -that sort of size. I would see these as forums and coordinators, not governments. This is very different from the present European Community model which is little more than an economic trading bloc with system- serving and centralising motivations. The continental forum I am thinking of would be a meeting place where regional representatives could exchange ideas and discuss issues of mutual interest. This level would arbitrate on disagreements between regions, ensure that one"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"279 region was not harming others economically and environmentally, and help to identify and direct the essentials of food, warmth, clothing and shelter to regions who were not yet self-reliant or who were struggling, temporarily, from the effects of natural disasters. They would also coordinate relief operations in places where natural disasters had occurred, with expertise, transport and technology on permanent standby to be on the scene in the shortest possible time. This would be a kind of Global International Rescue which all communities and regions could call upon. * The other level of representation would be the World Forum. This is not the same as World Government. It would be a place where representatives from the continental forums would meet to discuss topics that affected the whole world. It would arbitrate in disagreements between continents and co-ordinate the provision of essentials which a continent was unable, at any stage, to provide for itsel£ The World Forum would have no army at its disposal and, apart from powers to intervene to prevent environmental degradation that had global implications, it would have no other power to impose its decisions. All armies will be dismantled when the transformation of consciousness is well underway. I would also see the World Forum as a body that would represent the planet in formal interaction with other Universal Civilisations which are going to be openly visiting this planet and we theirs in the future just as we visit other countries today. We desperately need forms of democracy that empower and involve all people. The present ‘democracies’ were created by the Brotherhood with built-in flaws to ensure they were only illusions of freedom: “All these so called ‘People’s Rights’ can exist only in idea, an idea which can never be realised in practical lift. What is it to the proletariat labourer, bowed double over his heavy toil, crushed by his lot in lift, if talkers get the right to babble, journalists get the right to scribble any nonsense side by side with the good stuff? The proletariat has no other profit out of the constitution save only those pitiflil crumbs which we fling them from our table in return for voting in favour of what we dictate, in favour of men we place in power...” (Illuminati Protocol 3). This devolution of economic and representative power to communities with support, but not control, from above has built-in"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"280 environmental benefits. People, as a rule, do not wish to pollute their own neighbourhood. National governments give permission for polluting factories to be imposed only on those communities where they don’t have to live themselves. The main motivation of a national government is economic growth, not the wishes of one community. With decision-making transferred to community level, the incentives to reject polluting technology are far greater. If you are seeking to be self-reliant you are going to look after your environment as a first priority because that is your self-reliance. The link between a sustainable environment and a sustainable economy will be staring you in the face every day. This structure is not a model for the future written in stone. I have only outlined a few ideas to illustrate some of the trends that are already quietly underway and which will come to the fore as the transition proceeds to challenge the Brotherhood nightmare of central control. I expect the economics and representation of the future to be much more diverse than a single, set structure. In every community and region there will be variations on the theme of self-reliance in essentials and decision-making at the lowest level possible. There will be many difficulties and complications to overcome because these trends are faced with a world that has been geared and created to serve a very different system. Communities and regions do not break down into neatly packaged units with the ideal ratio of farmland to people. We have appalling urban sprawls and it will be some time before anything like the ideas I have put forward will be reality world-wide. There will be a lot of chaos, hard work and learning from experience before that can happen. What we can do is make a start now and try to de-link ourselves as much from the system as we can. It is worth noting again that the fewer material wants we have the less we need to work and earn to live. This frees more time for us to do what we really want to do. If we simplify our material lives we give ourselves choices which are denied us if we work, work, work to chase the material dream and its symbols of ‘success’. We need to free ourselves from the so-called work ethic. This insists that, unless we are in paid employment all day, at least five days a week, we are lazy and work-shy. What rubbish. But what could be better for the system over the last two hundred years than for us to believe in the work ethic and its misguided morality? With people rejecting this conditioning and giving themselves time and opportunity to use their"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"281 full creativity, we will see such changes for the better; an explosion in the arts for a start. Music, in particular, has a fundamental role to play in using its vibrations to raise the frequency of the planet, although it can be used to do the opposite in the wrong hands. We are going to discover more notes and tones as the changes gather pace. People think that the collapse of the present order will see us living in caves and tents for evermore. But the release of human creativity will lead us into a world of abundance. Being poor is not purity, it is poverty, and we will have the means to remove this cancer. Ours will be a world that celebrates and encourages beauty, style and excellence in all things. The idea, put forward by some, that living rough has some kind of spiritual street-cred is a delusion, I feel. The transformation is about balance while poverty is an obvious sign of imbalance within a society. Two areas related to political and economic change are the media and what we laughingly call justice. The media, or most of it, is the propaganda machine of the present system. Nowhere do the mainstream newspapers, magazines, radio and television programmes question the obsession with growth and free trade, except in the rarest of circumstances. The only questions they ask are how best to stimulate both. They never ask why these things are so desirable and what the consequences of them are. The media depends on the system to survive and offers all the support it can. It is also Brotherhood-controlled. The media has allowed itself to become the vehicle for selling the American (Brotherhood) culture to the world. In its raw state, the media is like knowledge. It is neither negative or positive. It is how it is used that is negative and positive. Some individuals in the media already do some outstanding work, exposing exploitation and hypocrisy and highlighting injustices that need to be addressed - but they are a depressing few. Local radio stations can be wonderful sources of information close to the people and they are going to be crucial in times of turmoil and change. The media could be used to communicate understanding and information that would free humanity. Instead, its overwhelming contribution is to imprison our thinking because its own thinking is imprisoned. “We must comple the governments of the goyim to take action in the direction fovoured by our widely conceived plan, already approaching the desired consummation, by what we shall represent as public opinion, secretly prompted by us through the means of that so called"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"282 ‘Great Power’ - the Press, which, with a few exceptions that may be disregarded, is already entirely in our hands.” (Illuminati Protocol 7). “What is the part played by the Press today? It serves to excite and inflame those passions which are needed for our purpose or else serves selfish ends of parties. It is often vapid, unjust, mendacious, and the majority of the public have not the slightest idea what ends the press really serves... ... All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions - aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, even anarchical - for so long as the constitutions exist... Every one of them will have a finger on any one of the public opinions as required. When a pulse quickens these hands will lead opinion in the direction of our aims... Those fools who will think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own camp will be repeating our opinion or any opinion that seems desirable to us.” (Protocol 12). I have been explaining in countless press interviews about the eternal nature of all consciousness, the frequencies, the so-called great mysteries of life, and why we are having extremes of weather and seeing the old order crumble. Only a very few have printed a word of this. They come along being nice to my face and go away to their typewriters to undermine what I am doing. All they have wanted to do is talk about is my private life and to misrepresent what I am saying to encourage the belief that I am crazy. I am challenging religion. They say I have discovered religion. I am questioning most of the Bible. They present me as a Bible-basher. I challenge the whole idea of ‘Messiahs’. They say I am claiming to be one. And mind-controlled people believe this stuff. They say, ‘You should never believe what you read in the papers’, but they go ahead and do exactly that. One journalist, who accepts the themes of what I am saying, wrote an article for a newspaper about me. The editor rejected it because it was ‘too positive’. I predicted in 1991 that we would see record- breaking weather extremes in this decade, particularly rains and floods. At a time when France, the Netherlands and Germany were suffering from terrible floods and the Isle of Wight, where I live, was being battered by rains which would lead to some of the worse floods the island has seen, a journalist rang my home. Did he want to talk about the weather, why it was happening and what we could do about"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"283 it? Not quite. “Who do you think should be the new manager of the England soccer team?”, he asked. On one occasion a friend in Scotland told me of an article in the Scottish Daily Record which had said I was a ‘Cult Lord’. As I had already written several books opposing the whole idea of cults, I was interested to see how the paper could justify such a claim. Across the top of the page was a giant headline ‘The Cult Lords’. Underneath were articles about various people. David Koresh, who was at the centre of the siege in Waco, Texas, was among them and there, alongside the mass murderer Charles Manson, was me! I wrote to the editor asking how on earth that could be justified and he replied that they had not suggested I was a cult leader!! And because of the injustice of the ‘justice’ system, which is only there for the rich in these cases, there was nothing I could do. I’m sure there will be more character assassination to come in an effort to discredit the information in this book. These are examples of the kind of mentality which mostly governs the stories you read and hear in the media. I have worked on local newspapers and regional and national television and radio. I have seen how journalists are some of the most programmed beings on the planet. Not all of them, but the majority. Especially at the extreme end. I dread to think of the karma they are collecting every day as they go about their business of distorting, lying and destroying lives. What they do to others, they will need to face themselves on the journey of evolution if their actions are motivated by negative intent. Like politicians, I feel for them. They know not what they do. They are de4inked from their higher selves and locked within a media structure that programmes them to programme others with their trivia, drivel, untruths, narrow vision and Brotherhood propaganda. When they leave the confines of the physical body they will be horrified at how they have allowed the system to control them. Most journalists are puppets of fear and negative thought patterns, but they don’t have to be. They are not bad people. They are misguided and they have the choice to change. Fortunately, the awakening process is there for everyone and many journalists are opening their consciousness to new ideas. Their problem is getting past the editors and the newspaper owners who block information because they don’t want to hear it or allow others to hear it. I laugh when the media complain of press censorship when the biggest censors of information"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"284 are the media themselves. Along with economics and politics, we have seen the centralisation of media power into Brotherhood hands. They control the world’s news agencies that feed information to newspapers and the broadcast media all over the planet. The Brotherhood media serves the Brotherhood bankers. I have no doubt, either, that intelligence services like the CIA have the technology to use television broadcasts to send subliminal messages into our non-conscious mind, without us, or even the television station concerned, being aware of it. In 1994 a Polish radio station began to send out an inaudible sound on its frequency to clear of mosquitos the homes tuned to that station. It was, apparently, very effective in doing so, but thousands of listeners started to complain that it was also driving their cats mad. If they can do that to insects and cats, they can do it to humans. What is really coming out of some of the explosion of radio and television stations around the world? I ask this ofjournalists or the ones who can’t see that they are being used as propaganda poodles: Are you going to go on meekly serving your masters, or are you going to rebel? If you only realised what the New World Order has in mind for you and your media, you would take a very large gulp! And where are the journalists’ unions in all this? I say to them: Get together, open your eyes, and stop cooperating. I cannot tell you how much you will regret it if you don’t. I will be most pleasantly surprised if such a journalistic rebellion does happen but, for now, on past experience, I will not be holding my breath. In the meantime, we have to provide alternative sources of information, and stop buying newspapers. The alternatives are emerging in magazines and papers struggling into life across the world. We also have access to a printing press - the photo copier -to network information through communities and further afield. I have found that radio is by far the best means of communicating in the media as it is today. Newspapers distort by reflex action and television is too often looking for items so short it is impossible to communicate effectively or in depth. I have found that radio offers the time to speak at length and if it is live you are free from editing. What you say is what the listeners hear. The staple diet of many radio stations is the phone4n and you have the chance every day to ring up and comment on subjects from the perspective presented in this book and countless others. The awakening is leading to growmg interest in subjects like reincarnation, alternative healing, UFOs, and related"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"285 topics. The media will not be able to resist this interest indefinitely because they will want to use it to increase sales and viewing figures. That will only further stimulate interest and help to awaken more people which, as a result, will speed the demise of the system on which the present media depends. In the communities of the future, communication of information will be much more diverse, both in content and control. There will be a revolution in ‘justice’, too. The police-lawyer-jury- judge system serves and protects the status quo and it is run by the Brotherhood secret societies, especially the Freemasons. One high ranking judge revealed the attitude behind our version of ‘justice’ when he said that people wrongly convicted by the system should not be released because it undermines public confidence in British justice. It takes massive ongoing campaigns over many years for those wrongly imprisoned to be released. Some never are. In Britain there are three people in prison for killing a newspaper boy called Carl Bridgewater. A fourth has already died since he was wrongly convicted. I covered this case when I worked for BBC Television. They are obviously innocent and the only reason they are still behind bars is that so many other wrongly convicted people have had to be released in the last few years and the authorities don’t want to open the criminal justice system to yet more derision. They want to put as much time as they can between those other high-profile releases and the inevitable release of ‘the Bridgewater Three’. Never mind that this policy demands that three people innocent of the crime for which they were convicted spend even longer in prison. The System comes first. Government ministers and officials who should have no influence in the courts or public inquiries meddle as much as they can when certain sentences or decisions would suit them politically. Some Home Secretaries make known their feelings in these cases, and this is communicated unofficially down the line and through the freemason’s network to the judge. Not every judge takes notice, but many do. It’s good for their career prospects and helps the Brotherhood. It is far from unknown for judges to be influenced in their sentencing and decisions by the secret signs that tell him the defendant or lawyer is a fellow freemason. When public inquiries are organised to hear objections into road projects that devastate communities and the environment, governments make sure an inspector who sympathises with their view is appointed to hear the objections and reject them. If people only knew what goes on behind"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"286 the scenes, the robots would have rebelled a long time ago. The winners in this charade of democracy and justice are the system and the legal profession which is alive with freemasons, as is the police force. It is run for the professions and the elite, not by a desire for fairness. The costs of going to court to pursue justice have long entered fantasy land. Most people have to concede their rights because they can’t afford to pursue them. This gives all the aces to those with money. They can afford to buy theirjustice. The majority cannot. Even legal aid which is supposed to help the poorest to pay for legal representation is being cut back at every opportunity. Meanwhile the leading lawyers and the judges take home often enormous salaries from a system that most people cannot afford to use. I was once involved in a civil case which should never have got to court. This happens, however, when one side is willing to negotiate and the other is not. All the costs in the case were awarded against me. Given the circumstances and the background that was outrageous, but that’s another story. My own legal costs were £1,500. The other side’s costs were estimated in court as about £2,000. But when their final bill arrived from a firm of solicitors in Banbury, Oxfordshire, it had grown miraculously to almost £4,000! My shock at this was made worse when I read the bill. Only £1,576 of that figure was for work the firm had actually done. On top of that they had charged me for not using a barrister. No you didn’t misread that. I said not using a barrister. It was a straight forward case that any competent solicitor could have handled and, as I say, there was no need for a court hearing, anyway. But because they were saying they could have used a barrister had they chosen to, I had to pay for them not doing so. No, I assure you I am not joking. It is quite within the law for them to do that. Also they charged me extra because I had ‘opposed their application throughout’ and because of the ‘importance of the case to our client’. I had to pay and in effect be financially punished by a firm of solicitors because I had challenged their demands and because it was an important case for their client. As every client considers court hearings to be extremely important to them, they could apply that added charge to every case they handle. I had to pinch myself to believe this was happening, and so did my own lawyer who was as bewildered and appalled as I was. You can appeal to a court against legal bills when costs have been awarded against you."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"287 It is called taxation. This I did and I was confident that the bill was so silly and against all laws ofjustice and fair play that it would be reduced and sanity would return. The court did reduce the bill. They reduced it by £135 and I was charged £186 for the cost of them doing so!!! It struck me that this was one case in one court on one afternoon involving one firm of lawyers. Just think what is going on in courts in America and all over the world. How many people are being cleaned out financially by pursuing their rights to justice or defending themselves against injustice? It is one of the great ironies that members of the legal profession who spend their time prosecuting or defending illegal theft are themselves responsible day after day for legalised theft. The legal system is in the same category as economics, politics, and most of the media. It is sick, corrupt, stupid, juvenile, self-destructing and brotherhood-controlled. Ask those many lawyers who are motivated by helping people and not by making as much money as possible and they will tell you the same. I know how frustrated these caring lawyers are at being forced to operate in such a corrupt and corrupting system. But you see the system has to persuade us that we do have freedom, live in a democracy, and have a fair system ofjustice. If it doesn’t maintain that facade, we are more likely to rebel. It is time we did. Governments do not look honestly and deeply at the causes of crime because to do so would reveal that the ‘values’ necessary for economic growth are the very values that encourage crime and violence. Instead they condemn law breakers, wash their hands of responsibility, and call for harsher punishments. The prisons are overcrowded because society is punishing the symptoms and not addressing the cause. And what is the reaction of the growth mentality to crowded prisons? You got it. Build more prisons. In America which claims to be the home of freedom, justice, and civilisation, some states still send people to the electric chair or the firing squad. This is not justice. It is barbarism. Opinion Polls (or rather opinion manipulators) in Britain continually show that the majority would bring back hanging for some crimes. What arrogance to think we have the right to take the life of another, and what mental gymnastics it must require to say that killing is wrong and the state should kill anyone who does it!! Expect to see governments trying to introduce more authoritarian laws in all countries as the decade progresses which further erode freedom. We must resist this,"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"288 peacefully, but with great determination. The changing consciousness will reject the present methods of ‘justice’. Crime will plummet when new values and measurements of human success are accepted and personal achievement is not measured by possessions. The move towards local decision makmg and the involvement of all people in the life and direction of communities will reduce negative behaviour still further. The relinking with our higher levels and all that understanding, love, and wisdom, will have the biggest impact on the reduction of crime and negative behaviour. Before that time arrives, we need to look at why people act in the negative ways they do. Why have people been so de-humanised that they can mug and maim frail old ladies. The way to change that is not to use the fear of incarceration in some grotesque prison that will further de-humanise them. It is to treat them in ways that re-humanise their values and spirit. If someone attacks an old lady, the way to stop them doing it again is to put them, under supervision initially, into situations where they meet and work with old people. This will allow them to see that those they mug are not meaningless, worthless, victims for those of greater physical strength. They are human beings with feelings. I see mediation within the community replacing courts and lawyers and ludicrous legal bills in the decades that follow the turn of the Millennium. The number of laws will diminish as will the numbers required to administer them. You don’t need laws to say you must not pollute, when human consciousness has reached a level that would not dream of harming the Earth in any way. Nor do you need laws to punish violence when there is no violence, because all life is seen as sacred. In the years before that I believe that more and more awakening people will refuse to cooperate with the economic, political, and legal systems in ever-increasing numbers. The system depends on mass subservience and unquestioning cooperation to survive. You can arrest a dozen people for a peaceful protest. You cannot arrest 100,000. Cooperation is the basis of the new world, but it has to be two-way. One-way cooperation leads only to exploitation. A refusal to cooperate with exploitation will be another way the system will fall. Writing about the themes of the future is difficult because there will be distinct phases of change. In the short term the breakdown of the old will bring chaos, confusion, and fear. Crime will grow as people grab and steal what the system can no longer provide in the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"289 old way. The Brotherhood will be encouraging crime, even stimulating it through its mind-controlling technology, because it wants the public to demand a more authoritarian police force with laws to match. We may see martial law, military coups, and internal conflicts increase around the world. Many will be looking around for someone to blame for this mayhem, and the encouragement of racial and ethnic prejudice will result. Most human minds have been programmed to hand over responsibility to others. Amid the confusion of change, they will look to any strong leader to tell them what to do. This is fertile soil for dictators. There will be tensions, sometimes severe, between those serving the status quo and those moving with the frequencies. The way they see life and what they wish to do will be in conflict. It is up to awakening people to avoid violence in these circumstances. The last thing we need is more negative energy adding to the extremes we already have. In contrast to these negative aspects of the transition, we will see the expansion in positive behaviour from those following the frequencies. These people will be healing divisions wherever they can. Old barriers between those of different colours, creeds, and ways of life, will be no more among those tuning in. This will be the new consciousness emerging from the death throes of the old. In the medium term, as the System sinks beneath a tidal wave of change, I feel the community and regional economies will be stabilising and order will return. By this time, the world population will have fallen rapidly, with more going out of incarnation than coming in. Those who hold out against the frequencies and close their minds will have left the planet as they fall behind the quickening vibrations. The level of consciousness that will inherit the Earth will be meek, in that it will not use violence or imposition, but it will be mentally and emotionally strong and wise. When the chaos subsides and calmness returns to the weather, the surface of the Earth, and humanity in general, beings of advanced evolution will arrive in large numbers to assist the development of the new societies. Much further into the future, the world will be unrecognisable from the one we see today and even from what I envisage for the medium period. The frequencies will have risen to levels ofknowledge and understanding that will give humanity the ability to manifest and de- manifest, to travel across space and time at will, to create through the power of thought, and to be dependent on nothing except the energy of life itself By then we will not even require food as we know it. We"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"290 will absorb all that we need from the Ocean of energy around us. Consciously leaving our bodies and experiencing other frequencies will be available to everyone whenever they wish. There will be no possession of people or objects. Love and respect for everyone and everything will be our guiding light."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"291 17 The Science of Sanity WE speak of the ‘wonders of modern science’. If only we knew how primitive some of those wonders really are. There is such a difference between the ‘science’ we are told about and that which we are not. We have the establishment scientists believing they are at the cutting edge of human understanding while in the secret underground bases technology exists that would blow their minds. Literally, some of it. Take our sources of energy, as created by the science we are allowed to know about. We rape and devastate the Earth collecting oil, gases, and clumps of matter. We release the energy held inside them by burning what we have collected. In doing this we lose much or most of the energy they contain and we create horrendous pollution that poisons our air and water and damages our forests. The alternative is to build blocks of concrete called Nuclear Power Stations. These create waste that is lethal for up to 24,000 years and probably far longer. No- one knows what to do with this waste, but we go on producing it. One of the by products is plutonium. One thousandth of a gram of this is fatal and if enough gets into the hands of a terrorist or dictator they could make a nuclear bomb. Oh yes, and should these power stations leak or explode as with Chernobyl, substantial areas of land become uninhabitable and incapable of supplying food. Thousands, possibly millions, will die sooner or later from radiation poisoning or cancer and there’s a good chance that babies born to those affected will be deformed. And this is called scientific advance? It is, rather, a scientific smokescreen. A deadly one. The Brotherhood at the highest human level made a definite decision to create support the myth that there is no such thing as spirit or an eternal sel£ It knew that wasn’t true, but that knowledge was for them, not the people whom they wanted to control. Religion had had"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"292 its day and humanity was starting to reject its view. This, the Brotherhood decided, could only continue to increase. Another rigid belief system had to take its place, and anyway, they preferred for people to think they were nothing, but lumps of meat. One of the Brotherhood’s creations was the famous Royal Society in Britain. It opened its doors in the late seventeenth century and has been a wonderful vehicle for selling the quite hysterical idea that only the physical world exists. Goodbye God. The media have once again played their part like the good lap dogs they have chosen to be and they still treat the words of a ‘scientist’ as solid gold truth. They are scientists after all, and they are very clever people who know more than we do. I know you don’t understand the jargon, but don’t worry your little head about it. You just get on with your life and let the scientists us tell you how things are. They know best. What a negative affect this has had on human life. We are back again to the five senses. The collective mind of ‘public’ science is convinced that this physical world is the only one that exists. They have ridiculed anyone, even members of their own profession, who have questioned this and the Brotherhood have arranged for much of that onslaught against real scientists. A science in this state of misunderstanding will obviously concentrate its research on the world of the five senses. Its ‘advances’ over the last 200 years or so have been in understanding some of the potential to exploit the physical environment. From the perspective of this physical level it has achieved some remarkable feats. It has landed on the Moon (well after the secret scientists did, however), developed endless gadgets, and found ways to treat the symptoms, though less often the causes, of some illnesses. But by ignoring or dismissing the existence of other non physical levels of people and the planet, it has given itself a very limited and lopsided view of Creation. Sadly it has done the same for billions of people. Far from advancing understanding, it has held it back by undermining the efforts of the more enlightened scientists and people working with psychic sources who challenge the this-is-all-there-is view of life. Say someone goes missing and you organise a search party. You choose not to look in the area where the person is lost and discourage or prevent anyone else from looking there. If anyone does you ridicule and condemn them when they say ‘I’ve found him’. So you don’t find the missing person and in the mind of the search party and all the people they influence that person remains lost. By taking your"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"293 search party to another area you may find other missing people you didn’t know were there. You will ‘discover’ many things that will be new to you. But you won’t find the one you are supposed to be searching for because he is lost in the area where you refuse to look. If you take the ‘missing person’ to be symbolic of the mysteries of life and the search party to be mainstream science, you have the reason why those so called ‘mysteries’ are still unanswered by science. Had they not done this and had they had the humility to listen, we would be much further along the road to solving our problems. In fact many of them would not have been created in the first place. Science is part of the problem when it could, and should, be part of the solution. If it had not been so obsessed with the physical world alone or been so arrogant in dismissing alternative thought, we would already have the technology to provide all the power and warmth we need by harnessing the Ocean of Energy all around us. We would not be destroying the planet for our heat and light. The knowledge of how to tap into the non-physical, sub-atomic, energies that surround us is available today, but the scientific establishment and the system in general does not want to know. The reason is that what we call ‘science’ is system-led. It is funded by, and owes its livelihood to, the system and the Brotherhood, which is following its own agenda. When I wrote It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, half the world’s scientists were involved in weapons research, and most of the rest were researching technologies to serve take, make and throwaway. The Lucifer-controlled system does not want us to know who we are and science has played its role brilliantly. It has denied the existence of our true selves and encouraged us to believe we are just a cosmic accident. People who know they are eternal beings of light and love, on an endless journey of evolution through experience, are not so easy to manipulate and control. Science has also been the System’s mad professor, producing all the potions, poisons, and technology that have so affected the planet. The System is based on oil and other fossil fuels, and with the help of science it has managed to protect these energy sources from the knowledge that would replace them with non destructive alternatives. I do not wish to decry the achievements that scientists have made in some areas, but the overall contribution of mainstream ‘public’ science has been to suppress human understanding and to use its knowledge for destructive, rather than constructive, purposes."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"294 The story of science has mirrored that of religion in many ways. Both decided on a creed and belief which they then imposed upon the world and both have sought to block all efforts to present information and evidence which exposes their misunderstandings. But then both are controlled by the same masters which have ensured that both can survive only by suppression. Once they painted their colours to the mast and proclaimed one unyielding dogma, their empires, funding, power, and influence have been dependent on the survival of that dogma in the minds of enough people. Suppression of information and understanding becomes essential to their continued existence. If you are a scientist who depends for his living on the current scientific dogma, the desire to block alternative explanations which would shatter that dogma, can be very compelling. The System, no doubt with considerable Brotherhood influence, has ensured that these key areas like science, politics, economics, the media, and religion must suppress truth if they are to survive. In suppressing that truth, they must also promote a destructive illusion for the robots to focus on. The media slavishly support them by communicating the myth that establishment science is at the cutting edge of human understanding. I wrote to all the BBC Television science programmes summarising the work of open minded scientists who are convinced the general themes of consciousness and frequencies set out in this book are true. I offered to put the programmes in touch with these people. I wrote to investigative programmes like ‘World In Action’ with the same information. Only one even bothered to reply, and that was only to say that in effect they did not cover topics that were not accepted by mainstream science! Game, set, and match to mind control. James Lovelock is one open-minded scientist who has challenged convention. He has put forward the theory of ‘Gaia’, the Greek name for the Earth Goddess. This theory proposes that the Earth, far from being dead matter, is a living, thinking, organism. I would go much further than Lovelock, but there is a great deal of what he says that fits in with the overall themes I am putting forward. In his book The Ages of Gaia he explains why science is system rather than information led: “You may think of the academic scientist as the analogue of the independent artist. In foct, nearly all scientists are employed by some large organisation, such as a governmental department, a university, or a multinational company. Only rarely are they free to express their"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"295 science as a personal view. They may think that they are free, but in reality they are, nearly all of them, employees; they have traded freedom of thought for good working conditions, a steady income, tenure, and a pension. They are also constrained by an army of bureaucratic forces, from the funding agencies to the health and safity organisations. Scientists are also constrained by an army of bureaucratic forces, from the funding agencies to the health and safrty organisations. Scientists are also constrained by the tribal rules of discipline to which they belong. A physicist would find it hard to do chemistry and a biologist would find physics well-nigh impossible to do. To cap it all, in recent years the ‘purity’ of science is ever more closely guarded by a selfiimposed inquisition called ‘the peer review’. This well-meaning but narrow minded nanny of an institution ensures that scientists work according to conventional wisdom and not as curiosity or inspiration moves them. Lacking freedom they are in danger of succumbing to a finicky gentility or of becoming, like mediaeval theologians, the creatures of dogma. “As a university scientist I would have found it nearly impossible to do full time research on the Earth as a living planet. To start with, there would be no funds approved for so speculative a research. If I had persisted and worked in my lunch hour or spare time, it would not have been long before I received a summons from the lab director. In his office I would have been warned of the dangers to my career of persisting in so unfashionable a research topic. If this did not work and obstinately I persisted, I would have been summoned a second time and warned that my work endangered the reputation of the department, and the directors own career.” Control the funding and the lab director and you control what is investigated and what isn’t. That is what the Brotherhood does. This all-knowing science has been with us for such a short time in human evolution. It is only very recently that some of the planets have been ‘discovered’. Neptune was not identified until 1846 and they didn’t know Pluto was there until 1930. There are more planets still to find in this Solar System, and thousands if not millions of other such systems across the Universe. If you took the Sun be the same size as an orange, then on that same scale the nearest star outside of this Solar System would be 3,000 miles away! To think we can pontificate on details about the Universe and dismiss the idea that there are other universal civilisations is just beyond belief. Scientific"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"296 understanding is in its infancy. It is like a small child forcing its view of the world on everyone else. When you look at its ‘big bang’ theory for the Universe, the explosion of a ‘Cosmic Egg’ of matter which they say formed the universe, it is incredibly naive. It is founded on calculations that other galaxies are speeding away from this one. The implication being, conventional thinking believes, that they are still being forced away by the power of the original explosion. It is a very tenuous hook on which to hang a theory that has become accepted by many as ‘fact’. Galaxies are moving because everything is in orbit. Much of the scientific ‘advancement’ of the modern world is merely the confirmation of what the ancients already knew, because space visitors and channelled communicators told them. Science is not as clever as it thinks it is, but far from showing the humility necessary for open minded research, it has consistently dismissed even its own profession when they have predicted new possibilities. They don’t understand something and so they arrogantly say it cannot happen. An Astronomer Royal said that talk of space travel was ‘utter bilge’ just eighteen months before the Russian Sputnik was orbiting the Earth, and that was primitive compared with what secret science was doing! As another astronomer, Carl Sagan, once said: “Intellectual capacity is no guarantee against being dead wrong”. If; however, alternative explanations are systematically suppressed everyone else is encouraged to be dead wrong also. But the dyke is collapsing for science as it is for all expressions of the system. From without, the evidence continues to mount through near death experiences and ‘inexplicable’ phenomena, that reveal the limitations of understanding and vision at the core of ‘public’ scientific theory. And from within, the open-minded, genuine, scientists who seek to unlock the mysteries of Creation are being inspired by the rising consciousness to accept what psychics have been saying for so long. These twin pressures on scientific dogma will bring current scientific ‘thinking’ and its empire of influence and delusion crashing down in this decade and the next one. With the genuine scientists now tuning into the higher frequencies, the understanding of who we are and the nature of life is awakening in their consciousness. This is leading them into areas of inquiry that will unlock the mysteries for them. The establishment will try to resist their findings, but it will make no difference. The laws of physics are going to be re-written. The way physics is currently perceived by scientists considered by the public to be ‘geniuses’ is in"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"297 reality well wide of the mark. The supporters of today’s view of physics have closed their minds to the non-physical levels of existence and ignored 99.99 per cent of Creation. No wonder their understanding is so limited. How tragic that scientists like Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, and many others had identified the basic answers to many of the mysteries scientifically much earlier in this century, but were ignored and attacked by Brotherhood supporters, as were the psychics who have known for thousands of years what today’s system-serving scientists still don’t know. More than 2,000 years ago the Greek philosophers understood the principles of life and Creation before Christianity, Islam, and others arrived on the scene. The rising consciousness will sweep away the delusions and present us with technology beyond our dreams. There will be no need for fossil fuels, electricity pylons, or even the ‘alternative’ sources like wind and wave power. Each home will have a device, perhaps no bigger than a shoe box, which will harness the Earth’s energy field to provide all the power and warmth we need. It will not have to be plugged into a grid. It will work independently anywhere you wish to take it. Transport will be revolutionised and made non-polluting by using the same understanding. We will have the knowledge to travel through time. Space travel will be like catching a bus today. The idea that we are alone in the Universe will seem as ludicrous as believing the Earth is flat. Later will come all the ‘miraculous’ feats like manifesting and demanifesting, which I have already spoken of. How do I know? Because most of it is already happening today, suppressed or in secret, and has been for decades. Free energy is a fact. By that I mean technologies that provide unlimited supplies of energy without using any fuel themselves. They access the ocean of power in the Earth’s energy field and other energies all around us and produce no pollution and no environmental degradation whatsoever. You need no coal mines, no oil rigs, no power stations, nuclear or otherwise, and no ugly power lines in a national grid. These technologies can be used to heat and power homes, businesses, vehicles, anything. We talk of the ‘electric vehicle’ running on batteries, when the brilliant Croatian scientist Nikola Tesla ran a car in New York with a form of free energy technology in 1931, and man called John Worrel Keely of Philadelphia demonstrated his ‘Dynaspheric Force’ free energy machine in New"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"298 York in the 1890s! While investigating the magnetic forces flowing between the Earth’s, poles, he discovered that ‘corpuscles of matter’ could be divided by vibration and the principle used to drive a motor. The inventors of free energy technology have always suffered suppression and some have been harassed in other ways. One, John Searl, was jailed for his trouble. In 1946, when he was only 14, he built his Searl Effect Generator (SEG) which was inspired by a dream he had as a boy. It was based on a magnetic device, and it generated usable electricity. As he perfected his creation, Searl also began to build flying craft using the same power system which could out perform even today’s conventional air and space craft. Three months before he planned to build a craft for a manned flight, he was jailed for using his own free electricity and not paying the power company to use theirs! While Searl was in prison on this outrageous charge, the authorities burned all his papers. The Brotherhood and the System in general is desperate to stop these technologies, because they will remove our dependence for fuel and warmth and the whole cover-up of their technology will begin to come to light. Many free energy inventors are refused patents, and their work can be classified by an international ‘Military Use Refuse’ law which can stop them from publishing their findings or promoting their technology. But the Brotherhood elite know all about it, because the information goes to their secret scientists. How appalling to think that while old people shiver from the cold and die from hypothermia because they can’t afford their heating bills, the ability to produce limitless energy for free is suppressed to serve the interests of some perverted elite. In Britain, fuel bills have increased enormously after a new tax was added, and people suffer ill health from the pollution caused by this primitive burning of fossil fuels. Meanwhile the answer is blocked and has been for decades. Where are you politicians? Where are youjournalists? Where are you environmental groups? Expose this scandal and insist that free energy technologies are further developed and made available to everyone. The free energy technology of the Illuminati elite is further ahead of anything the public know about as it is in other scientific knowledge. How they must smile at what is being taught to students in the schools and universities of the world under the title ‘science’. The Brotherhood know that the laws of creation as set out at the"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"299 start of the book are correct. They know about energies and frequencies. It may be a version twisted by other misunderstanding, but they know the real laws of physics. I am not saying this next story is all accurate, it may be disinformation, but it will give you some idea of how far ahead Illuminati scientists are of ’Goyim’ scientists. Franklin D Roosevelt was a close friend of Nikola Tesla, the scientific genius who was to say that much of his knowledge came from ETs. One of Tesla’s students, Guglielmo Marconi, set up a secret group which claimed to have built ‘flying saucers in the 1940s, and to have landed on the Moon in the early 1950s. Interestingly, a number of Marconi scientists and others working in similar areas have strange and inexplicable deaths. Roosevelt asked Tesla, some researchers claim, to become the director of a project which is now known as the Philadelphia Experiment. His number two was Dr John Von Neumann and the team based themselves at Princeton University before everything was moved to the Brooklyn Naval Yard in 1940 and code named Project Rainbow. The brief was to make an American ship invisible both to the radar and the human eye. They achieved this with a mine sweeper by generating intense magnetic fields. Tesla was given a battleship for his next experiment in 1942, but protested when he learned that this time there would be a crew on board. He felt they would be in danger and, it seems certain, he sabotaged the test which didn’t work. Tesla left and ten months later he was said to have been found dead in his New York hotel room. Von Neumann took over and on July 20th, 1943, he conducted the experiment again on the US destroyer escort, ‘The Eldridge’. It worked, but the crew went hysterical and were sick. Von Neumann asked for more time to perfect the technology, but the Chief of Naval Operations insisted it was finished by August 12th, 1943, because they wanted to use this capability in the war. He said, however, that he would accept only radar invisibility. This they achieved in Philadelphia Harbor, but then after a blue flash, the Eldridge disappeared for three hours. Now it gets complicated because we are about to cross frequencies of time and space. Two young scientists on board, Edward and Duncan Cameron, came on deck to find the crew suffering from extreme hysteria and the two of them jumped overboard. The story claims that they didn’t land in water, but in the Montauk Army Base on New York’s Long Island"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"300 where they realised that it was now 1983 - forty years later. Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but stay with me! The general background to the Philadelphia Experiment has been told in a feature film, and the basic themes of it are said to be correct. In the underground centre at Montauk the Camerons were taken to see Von Neumann, now of course a much older man than the one they had known in 1943. Von Neumann was reported to have died in 1957, but that was part of the cover for his work. He told them that they had to be transported back in time to the Eldridge in 1943 to smash the equipment because the experiment had created a ‘bubble in hyperspace which threatened to cause catastrophe on this frequency. Von Neumann had by now (1983), perfected the technology for time travel thanks to the extraterrestrial input since the 1950s, this story claims. The Camerons were transported back to the ship and 1943 where they smashed the equipment. When that happened, the Eldridge reappeared physically. See, I said it was complicated, and it’s even more so when you read the full story as documented in other books. It is hard to comprehend all this if we remain stuck with our version of time rather than a version in which the past, present, and projected future are happening together. Perhaps most amusing was the fact that when Cameron, back in 1943, told Von Neumann what had happened to him in 1983, his boss refused to believe him! Again I say that I am not suggesting that I believe every word of this. I don’t know. There are some amazing stories coming out, but I do believe that at least the Illuminati scientists are working in these sort of areas, including inter-frequency and, possibly, time travel. It is said that when the Eldridge returned to the physical world of 1943, it was a nightmare to behold. The time-space-molecular synchronisation had been so scrambled by what happened that many of the crew members were found to be part of the superstructure of the ship. Others were insane and still others would disappear or burst into flames. Talk about cleverness without wisdom. The mad professors are out of control. The researchers making these claims say the project was stopped after the Eldridge disaster and Von Neumann went to Los Alamos to work on the development of the Atomic Bomb. But by 1947 curiosity, and the potential for power presented by what had been learned in the Philadelphia Experiment got the better of them. It was re-started under Von Neumann as Project Phoenix at the Brookhaven National Laboratories in New"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"301 York. He also worked with the recovery of the crashed space craft and extra-terrestrials, like the one near Roswell. Some researchers say that a number of craft were deliberately brought down by the American military, when they realised how they could be seriously destabilised. Von Neumann and Dr.Vannevar Bush were two who worked with the extraterrestrial from the Roswell crash known as EBE, it is suggested. The development of Project Phoenix into the 1980s has, some claim, produced the knowledge and technology to travel through time. One story says they have travelled forward in time, but when they reach 2011 everything enters a dream-like state. 2011 links in with the predictions of the Maya and others for the time of great change. There is so much speculation, and looking at the themes rather than all of the detail, claim and counter-claim, is probably far more productive. It is further said that Von Neumann and the secret scientists have also perfected the technique of making a person older or younger by breaking their ‘time lock’. Tesla was working on time locks before he died, or disappeared. We are time4ocked at birth into this frequency’s version of time. On physical death, the time lock breaks and we are free to move on to other space-time worlds. Without this time lock during a physical life it would be chaos, and the sort of things that happened to the crew of the Eldridge would be happening to all of us. But if you can remove the time lock in a controlled way, you can advance or regress the age of the physical body, or so some investigators have said. The Brotherhood elite know how to change the weather in a limited way, and from the grotesque experiments they carry out on their abducted victims these insane scientists also know how to create clones. Some of the ‘little greys’ which people often report seeing could be from their laboratory and I’m sure they have developed the ability to create a human body, Frankenstein style. To think we are having discussions about the morality of genetic engineering while this is going on! Thousands of people go missing in the world every year and are never seen again. A number of them, I have no doubt, end up in the underground laboratories. Their understanding of anti-gravity technology - space craft - is now very advanced and many of the UFO sightings we hear about will be craft being tested and flown by human pilots. The bright light or glow around a UFO as reported by so many people is caused by the magnetic field produced by some craft which distorts the"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"302 gravitation field to create anti-gravity. There are many different technologies that these craft use to harness the natural energy fields. Think what such knowledge could do in the right hands. It could bring an end to poverty, suffering and environmental degradation, We could be travelling from Britain to Germany in five minutes, Britain to Australia in half an hour or less. Leaving today’s destructive insanity behind will not mean poverty for everyone, as the present system collapses. We have the choice to have a life made easier by amazing, non-destructive, technology that will dump poverty, hunger, and homelessness into the dustbin of history where it belongs. This we will do because these misguided men and their extra-terrestrial masters are not going to win. The transformation, with help from all levels, is going to remove their manipulation, and they will have to wait for another opportunity to work out their vast imbalances. They will do their damndest to cause havoc over the next 20 years or so, but their control of this planet is coming to its conclusion. There needs to be a rebellion of science students - all students -in every university, each coordinating with the others. They should demand to know what knowledge is really available and reject the rubbish they are being spoon fed to keep them in the dark. The same with their lecturers, most of whom don’t know what is going on either. Come on, get moving my friends. There is no time to lose. Don’t take no for an answer. Do it peacefully and with love, but ensure it is underpinned by unbreakable determination. The robots must rebel, or you will regret it forever and a day. The medical students and other health employees need to do the same. The way people suffer when there is no need, is one of the greatest scandals of this story. As the transformation progresses, other methods of healing will bring an end to the drug-obsessed, surgery obsessed, disease care services of today. Once again medical science has been directed to see only the physical level of being. It treats symptoms and not causes, because it does not understand the causes. How can it when most illness results from imbalances on our non- physical levels and medical science insists those levels don’t exist? It is known that people who live under or near power lines or have close contact with electromagnetic technology are more prone to certain illnesses, particularly some cancers. Human science has no idea why this should be. But our non-physical self is a series of electromagnetic energy fields working as one. When we come into"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"303 close and consistent contact with other powerful electromagnetic fields thrown out by power lines and technology, our subtle selves are affected in various ways. This imbalance distorts the etheric body which governs the workings of the physical. In turn the etheric organisation is disrupted and the physical becomes imbalanced, resulting in cancer or another dis-ease. That is why the crew of the Eldridge was so affected on all levels by the immense electromagnetic field they were subjected to. Even illness is used to serve the system. The Brotherhood-owned or -controlled drug companies fund scientific research, and insist that the scientists they are funding look only for ways of treating disease through drugs or technology that can be bought and sold. The world is awash with tablets and potions, and the drug companies measure their profits in billions. Some of their gross markups are as high as 90%. But the disease-care services are submerged by people who are ill! When I was younger I had a doctor who hardly lifted his head long enough to look at me before he was writing a prescription for some drug or other. Representatives from the drug companies have many ways to ‘encourage’ doctors to use their products. So many people are ill, physically or emotionally, that the disease-care services are little more than conveyor belts cutting open and administering drugs to the never-ending stream of system-created disease that is passing by. The doctors and nurses are as much the victims as the patients. For doctors and nurses, see economists, politicians, scientists andjournalists. They are programmed to think the System’s way and do its bidding within the prison of misunderstanding it builds around them. But again many are awakening from this slumber. Nothing sums up better the conveyor belt mentality of medical care than a circular sent out by a doctor’s practice on the Isle of Wight. It said that patients were reminded that doctors appointments were for five minutes only and this was not the time to discuss other problems. There you have it in a sentence. The fact that the ‘other problems’ were likely to be the cause of their illness did not seem to register. If there are imbalances in our eternal selves, especially at the emotional level, they will filter down through the chakra system to manifest as physical disease or disease. Medical science reacts by throwing drugs at the symptoms while ignoring the cause. It accepts that stress and emotional problems can cause illness because the evidence is overwhelming. But it rejects any idea of eternal consciousness and so"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"304 it cannot understand why stress causes disease. When they identify an emotional problem they prescribe Valium or other anti-depressants in an attempt to suppress the symptoms. What the patient really needs is for the cause of their depression to be addressed. If you are depressed because you have poor housing you don’t need drugs you need a decent house. But instead of being a health service, the system has turned doctors and nurses into medical garbage collectors, coping with the human debris the system daily tips out. I am not condemning doctors or anyone in the medical profession. What else can they do when their workload is such that they can give no more than five minutes to a patient and have no power to provide what the patient really needs to remove their dis-ease? Preventative medicine which removes the causes of dis-ease before they become physical problems is largely ignored by the medical establishment, because to do what is necessary would mean re- thinking all its values and misguided principles. Instead, even preventing illness - or claiming to - is used to stoke the fires of financial opportunism and exploitation. Did you know that the fluorides added to drinking water in the name of fighting tooth decay were used as rat poison for nearly 40 years? Since the early 1900s industrial fluorines have been a major polluter of rivers and streams, poisoning land and animals. They are a by-product of the aluminium industry. In 1939 the Mellon Institute in the USA asked Dr Gerald Cox to find a market for fluoride waste. Cox, a biochemist, suggested the idea of putting them in the public drinking water. This delighted his paymasters, the Melon Institute, because it was owned by the family of Andrew Mellon, the owner of the Aluminum Corporation of America (ALCOA). In 1944, Oscar Ewing was employed by ALCOA at an annual salary of $750,000, and this was fifty years ago! Within months he had moved on to be the head of the Federal Security Agency and he began a campaign to have fluoride added to public water supplies. By 1951, he had persuaded Congress that it was a good idea and was given two million dollars to start the work. You could not put this rat poison into rivers and streams because it was considered too dangerous, but you could put it into water that people drank. This was great for ALCOA, but terrible for the people, and this sort of covert wheeler- dealing is going on behind the politician-speak every day. This is dream land for drug companies. It is no surprise that one drug"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"305 company alone I saw increased its six monthly profits by 1.7 billion dollars. This adds greatly to the wealth of people like the Rockefellers who own half the pharmaceutical industry in the USA, according to Nexus magazine. But such increases in profits have run parallel to the growth in drug-related illness. Dr Brian Strom, Associate Director of Medicine and Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, estimates that the side effects from drugs kill 160,000 Americans every year, and put 1.6 million into hospital. I’ve seen people I know prescribed pills for symptoms, and other to offset the effects of them. This is making the tills ring even quicker for the drug companies. If medical science does not understand the true nature of the human being, how can it avoid creating drugs that cause more harm than the original illness they are designed to treat? But then a drugged-up population is just what the Brotherhood wants. And how do we know what they are putting in those drugs? The drug companies are terrified of alternatives to this madness. They portray alternative healers as ‘quacks’ who are potentially dangerous when they, themselves, are often lethal. There are people who call themselves alternative healers who are nothing of the kind and you have to be careful. But I don’t remember an alternative healer coming up with Thalidomide which deformed so many babies; nor do I recall them giving people drugs with side effects that ensure their victims will never be able to walk out in the sunshine again. Drug companies have done both and much more. Just as the oil companies and the Brotherhood seek to stop free energy technology, so the Brotherhood drug companies make every effort to discredit and destroy all cures that do not involve drugs. They don’t want a cure for cancer. They are making too much money selling drugs to treat the symptoms of it. This is not about health. It is about wealth. The Pharmaceutical Industry is one of the most corrupt and corrupting organisations humanity invented. It is Brotherhood- controlled and one of the most sinister of its operations. Ian Sinclair, in his book You can overcome Asthma says that in 1972, a commission set up by the Chilean President, Salvador Allende (a doctor), reported that no more than two dozen drugs were actually effective. The doctors on the commission proposed a dramatic reduction in drugs purchased from the companies, mostly American. Within a year, the junta with CIA support, had ousted Allende in a"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"306 coup. The doctors on the commission were killed, and the new regime recommenced business as usual with the drug companies. The industry controls the whole system - doctors, universities, research, government, health departments, the lot. And when they are prevented from marketing drugs which are exposed as dangerous, they dump them on the Third World. So, everyone involved in medicine, are you going to continue to take all this, or are you going to get together and do something? AIDS is a massive earner for the drug industry. They even leaked claims about ‘cures’ to boost their share price as people invest in a company in the hope that they will make lots of money when the ‘cure’ is marketed. They do this with other ‘cures’ too, and the media poodle barks to its master’s tune again by running stories of drug research projects on the verge of this or that ‘breakthrough’ which never sees the light of day. AIDS, this heaven-sent profits- booster for the drug companies, is not some mysterious disease that has come from nowhere. It was almost certainly created in a laboratory. I have seen some evidence presented by Robert Strecker MD that AIDS is basically caused by the amalgamation of two animal diseases - bovine leukemia in cattle and visna virus which affects sheep. Dr Strecker says that, the genes of the AIDS-causing virus do not exist in primates or humans. But they do exist in these two viruses, known as retro-viruses, in cattle and sheep. During hearings of the Church Committee in 1969 it was learned that the Department of Defence had asked for ten million dollars to create new viruses to destroy the immune system. In 1972 the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation (part of the UN) carried suggestions from a group of virologists that a virus be made to destroy the T-cell and B-cell systems of human beings. The idea was, it appears, that if they could make a virus to cause cancers and leukemia, it would help them to find a cure for those diseases. Strecker’s research leads him to believe that the bovine leukemia and visna virus were mixed in the laboratory to create the bovinevisna virus. This was then grown in human tissue, which turned into a virus that affected the human body in a way that dismantled the immune system. We call it AIDS. The authorities denied this, and even denied the existence of the cattle-sheep virus combination known as the bovine-visna virus, but Dr Strecker tracked down papers detailing this very thing. He says:"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"307 “(Bovine-visna virus) had the exact same shape as the AIDS virus; it had the same molecular weight; it had the exact same genetic structure in a sense; it had the exact same Magnesium dependency, which is relatively unique in this class of agents. It had the exact same capability of killing T-cells selectively and yet, in the cumulative knowledge of the world’s AIDS experts, this virus didn’t exist. Now that’s a lie. “What we think happened was that... in 1972 we produced a group of viruses that will cause cancer in the laboratories around the world and then, in our opinion, these viruses were probably tested. We think they were tested in large populations in Africa, which explains how you get three hundred million Africans probably infected today The epidemic in Africa would not have started from a single-point infection. In other words, the numbers infected are so great that there had to be a mass inoculation at some point in the mid-1970s. What we think really happened was a group of scientists went to Africa and actually tested these agents there.” It is also interesting that, according to Dr Strecker, the initial spread of AIDS in the United States tallies exactly with a US Government vaccine study on Hepatitis B which involved young, white male homosexuals between the ages of twenty and forty. AIDS appeared where the Hepatitis vaccine study had been - New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and St. Louis. If you believe that no one would ever do such a thing, that’s because you run your life with standards that are far higher than the misguided people who run the world. When you think that many countries have tested nuclear bombs without evacuating either their soldiers or the local population, because they want to study the effects on the human body, it is clear how much respect some of these characters have for human life. Poisons and radiation have been released purposely into local populations around the world for studies on the effects. Germ warfare testing has been conducted in this way. One of the projects which have done this in the United States was called MK-ULTRA which I spoke of in an earlier chapter.. Robert Strecker says that in Alabama, they recruited black men in the 1930s for a long-term study on the progression of syphilis, and when penicillin came along, they prevented the men from being cured, because they considered the study more important. The same mentality, and worse, goes on in the scientific community today among the extremists. That Alabama"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"308 study, incidentally, was conducted by the US Public Health Service Department which today works out of Atlanta, Georgia under the title of The Center for Disease Control, and it ‘leads’ the government battle against AIDS. I feel that the cure for AIDS might already be known. I don’t know if all Dr Strecker’s assumptions are correct, but he makes some telling points and I feel sure that AIDS has its origin in a laboratory or with negative ETs. One of the themes running through the findings of the researchers into the New World Order is that there is a secret plan to reduce the global population by genocide, and that includes attempts to use diseases like AIDS and germ warfare techniques. As I say, these are strange people under the influence of a very misguided force. What is it that the Protocols say? They would undermine humanity in part by “the inoculation of diseases”. The idea of reducing the population through the spread of disease is believed to have originated from a meeting of scientists in 1957, who came to the conclusion that the soaring population, pollution and the exploitation of the environment would destroy the planet’s life support systems by the year 2000. Eisenhower ordered a study to be conducted into alternative ways of responding to this crisis. Alternative One was to use nuclear devices to blast holes in the stratosphere to allow heat and pollution to escape, and change the destructive human culture into one ofenvironmental protection (this was rejected). Alternative Two was to construct underground cities, connected by tunnels, where selected representatives of the various cultures would continue the human race. Alternative Three was for the chosen few to move to new bases on the Moon and other planets. The Moon was code-named ‘Adam’ for this plan, and Mars was ‘Eve’. All three alternatives include the release of deadly diseases, and AIDS is said to be one of them. I cannot confirm any of this, and I don’t present it as fact, but what is obvious is that we have not even begun to know the full story about AIDS. One body of opinion suggests that the HIV virus, which is said to cause AIDS, is not the culprit, or not the only one, and I believe that the electromagnetic pollution produced by the military and secret services is harming the human immune system. The cure for AIDS and other human diseases lies in the areas termed alternative medicine. I am particularly impressed with vibrational medicine and the use of sound to re-balance and reharmonise the mind, body and spirit. I said before that every"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"309 vibration has its own sound, shade of colour, symbol and number, and if you can use these to harmonise the body and the human energy field, dis-ease is replaced by health. The sound which represents the vibration of tre-harmony for the Earth is the ‘OM’ sound and its colour is white, the amalgamation of all colours. The ancients knew of this The symbol of the OM vibration is the three spirals which together form a triangle. It can be found on countless ancient sites, stones and caves. This knowledge is now resurfacing in our consciousness, and it will revolutionise healing. Alternatives like acupuncture, homeopathy, rieki, radionics, aromatherapy, reflexology, and others reflect a far wider understanding of the human being. They seek to remove the imbalances on all levels and treat the cause, not the symptom. Preferably, they wish to identify potential trouble and re-balance the energy fields before any physical discomfort is felt. Acupuncture, which is thousands of years older than the drug companies, uses needles to balance out the energy flows through the chakras and the lines of energy known as meridians. Hands-on healing of the genuine kind is not ‘faith healing’; it is the transfer of energies from the healer through their hands to the patient. A form of photography developed by a Russian couple called Kirlian can photograph the energy fields around the body. They found that when they photographed someone with an illness the energy fields were weak. When they photographed healers, the energies were particularly vivid and bright. After a healing session, the patient’s energies were stronger and the healers had temporarily diminished. Everyone has the potential to heal to some level depending on what they have chosen to do in this life. In the next few years, millions are going to realise that they have come to the Earth to be healers, because that is going to be vital during the transition. The evolution of healing is another example of why the system has to collapse if real change is to be realised. The growth in alternative healing has been hastened by the breakdown of the disease-care services like the National Health Service in Britain. That is constantly short of funds because the system is unable to produce the money from over-production to cope with the growth in human dis- ease caused by conspicuous consumption; and when a health service is dependent on drug-based treatments and expensive surgery, it will never have enough money for all it needs to do. The demise of the economic system is encouraging people to look for alternatives like"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"310 barter, and it is the same with healing. The disease services are falling apart and people are turning to alternatives far more rapidly than they would otherwise have done. The changes in conscious ness will speed this process every year, until we see a fusion between the knowledge of the physical level as expressed by today’s doctors, and the understanding of the higher levels which alternative methods possess. I do not see this fusion as a 50-50 balance. Nothing like. The alternative methods will become the overwhelming foundations of health care, and other even more effective methods will be developed as higher knowledge becomes available to us and we can control the aging process and remove genetic disease by re-programming the DNA genetic coding. The cut ‘em and drug ‘em days are almost over. We will see that the physical body is a far more fantastic creation than science has yet understood and the basis of all health and illness is thought. Our etheric energy fields organise the physical body as I have already said and it encodes every single cell with a memory of what it is and what it has to do. A cell is a classic example of the universal principal of as above, so below. Each one is, in its energy system and memory, a smaller version of the whole body. Our thoughts are constantly affecting this process positively and negatively. Everything that happens to us which affects our thoughts is affecting the DNA genetic coding which we pass on to our children, or, at be more accurate, the physical bodies we create for the consciousness of our children. We can get genetic illness because of an emotional trauma or physical accident which someone experienced in the same genetic line thousands of years ago. The affect of the emotions on the etheric organisation is passed through to the DNA and on down the line until the DNA is ‘wiped’ clean of that inherited genetic imbalance. This can be done very quickly and simply in a few minutes once you know how, and long-standing illnesses disappear after such treatment. It does not involve a single drug or any surgery whatsoever. As this gains acceptance you will not be able to give away shares in the drug companies and conventional medicine. We are obviously very much affected by the genetic history of the ancestral line of our genetic spacesuits and people are dying every day, every minute of every day come to that, for the want of a simple treatment that can remove the genetic inheritances that all bodies carry. What we do and what we experience emotionally and physically in this life is passed on to our children. Once this DNA cleansing is widely accepted, expectant"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"311 mothers and would-be fathers will go through this process to ensure that they are passing on only positive genetic codes to their children. The emotional state of the mother during pregnancy has a very big effect on the children, because the baby in the womb is linked to the mother’s blood supply and its growing form is affected genetically by what she is experiencing emotionally. Healers in this field of Vibrational Medicine and genetic cleansing are years ahead of medical science as we have come to know it. Watch the drug companies try to marginalise and outlaw alternatives to their empires of greed as the years progress. They are already doing so, and we should respond to this in the usual way - by ignoring them and any laws that might arise from their lobbying. The expansion of healing and healers cannot happen too fast. Some diseases will disappear with the rising consciousness, while new ones will develop some of them from the effect of the quickening vibrations on those who choose to close their minds to change. The vibratory disharmony between those people and the consciousness of the planet will have many consequences for mental, emotional, and physical well-being. The more people who have activated their healing gifts, the better it will be for everyone. This need will be compounded by the consequences of administering drugs like sweets. I wrote in It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This of the danger from ‘Superbugs’. These are viruses that have developed immunity to drugs like antibiotics which have been prescribed for almost anything that moves. We are now seeing these Superbugs and I feel that some diseases we thought had gone forever will start to return. Superbugs, incidentally, have implications for food production. Drug4nfested farming methods are giving insects immunity to the poisons sprayed on the crops. On the other side of the transition our knowledge will be such that we will live on this physical level for hundreds of years if we wish, just as we did in Atlantis. We will hear stories of a time on Earth when people said that only the physical world existed; we will be told of a civilisation so primitive that they ravaged the planet for fuels, cut open their bodies, and used potions that caused as much illness as they cured. We will smile at the story tellers. We will shake our heads. And we will find itso hard to believe."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"312 18 Bricks in the Wall LET me offer you a definition of the word education as expressed in schools and universities across the world: To teach, instruct, and imbue with a doctrine, idea or opinion. The Oxford English Dictionary would not agree because that it is the definition it gives for the word ‘indoctrinate’. But, to me, that is a perfect description of humanity’s version of education. Our children are not educated. They are indoctrinated - ‘imbued with a doctrine, idea, or opinion. This is essential to the process of conditioning that we are subjec- ted to throughout our lives. Education for the young is a wonderful concept if education is what it really is. But the system largely controls what children are taught, how they are taught, and what it wishes them to believe. What better way to condition your population than to have control of what young people are taught through their formative years? And from what we have seen of the system in all its glory, do you think this control is going to be used for the good of the children or the good of the system? Education, at least in its Western mode, is there to turn out system fodder. It fills young and potentially creative minds with streams of boring, irrelevant and often inaccurate information; with complex mathematical equations most people will never use; and with a view of history that puts the State in the best possible light. A Texan lady told me how she was taught history. First, a long time was spent making the class feel good about being Texan. They were not only the best people in America, they were the best in the world. Once that was established, the genocide of the Indians by the white settlers was glossed over and rushed through in a ridiculously short time. You would have thought, she said, that only in the 20th century did American history really start. What you would call ‘education’ is part of the Brotherhood war on the young:"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"313 “We have got our hands into the administration of the law, into the conduct of elections, into the press, into the liberty of the person, but principally into education and training as being the corner-stones of a free existence. We have fooled, bemused, and corrupted the youth of the Goyim by rearing them in principals and theories which are known to us to be false although it is by us that they have been inculcated.” (Illuminati Protocol 10). I have been saddened on my many visits to universities to see young people in their teens who do not have a thought in their head that someone else has not put there. They stand before you after only 17 or 18 years on the planet and are already mindlessly parroting the system’s propaganda. Another robot reporting for duty. I was amazed to be told in all seriousness by a student at the prestigious Cambridge University that if you don’t eat meat you die! The fact that I was standing in front of her fit and well after many years as a vegetarian had no effect on her conviction that refusing to eat dead animals was the equivalent of suicide. You can understand how indoctrination can take hold so quickly. The further you progress within the education system the more opportunity there is to control your thinking. Some of the most enlightened people I have met left school as early as they could and had not been to university. Enlightenment comes by expanding your consciousness and accessing higher levels of knowledge. Most conventional education closes minds and focuses them on this physical world alone. The campaigner, Michael Roll, makes this point in his booklet The Suppression of Knowledge. He was referring here to those in high places within the system, but the principles apply to everyone and everything, be it religion, science, or economics: “If a baby from birth is told by loving parents that 2 + 2 = 3; and later at Sunday school, kindergarten, preparatory school, public school, and university this young mind is again told by apparently clever and often highly respected teachers that 2 + 2 = 3; and if this same teaching comes through the mass media, backed by the weight of law, is it any wonder that many people, often in very responsible positions, seriously believe that 2 + 2 = 3 ?” The system is geared to the setting and passing of examinations. This immediately creates ‘successes’ (those with the ability to absorb"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"314 and remember m6stly irrelevant and inaccurate information) and ‘failures’ (those who do not have that ability or are too bored to use it). The ‘successes’ go on to university to absorb yet more irrelevant and inaccurate information and the ‘failures’ go off to look forjobs that are more likely to be given to the ‘successes.’ What a way to start your life, be you a success or failure. I was a failure under that definition. I was bored stiff at school. I could not see how most of the tidal wave of information I was being forced to listen to day after day could have any relevance to my future life. I also had the underlying feeling that most of what I was being told was baloney anyway. I was talked at by the teachers and rarely consulted for my view or asked to express creativity. I never passed an exam and I left school at the first opportunity to become a professional soccer player. All my education in its true sense has happened since. I enjoyed school for the sport and my friends. I liked most of the teachers, too, because they were very nice people. But the lessons and examinations were something I had to endure in order to play soccer and be with my mates. I can see why the system loves examinations. They are an excellent way of making children and young people absorb the system’s view. There is little margin for personal opinion. If you are going to pass you must tell the status quo what it wants to hear. Who sets the questions in exams? The status quo. Who decides what the answers must be if you are going to pass? The status quo. Whatever is the conventional wisdom of the day provides the criteria under which you pass or fail. A few centuries ago you would have failed your exam if you had said the Earth was round! Like all aspects of the system, education is in desperate trouble. (ts role is to produce robots to fill the jobs the system requires them to do and to condition out of young people any idea of rebellion against the status quo. The system does not evolve to encompass the gifts and creativity of people; people have to be conditioned and prepared to fit the system. People blindly accept that while take-make-and- throwaway could employ the robots. Most accepted that you went to school to be prepared for work and then you worked in a trade until you retired or died. But now that is no longer happening in the same way. Millions of young people can see no prospect of ajob at the end of the line. Even the ‘successes’, the university graduates, are struggling to find employment. A feeling of ‘what’s the point?’ is growing. Truancy is mostly caused through boredom and a lack of"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"315 self worth and involvement at school. Everyone, but everyone, has latent creativity and gifts they have come to offer the world. Human education is only seriously interested in the gifts that fit the system and that leaves out a terrific number of alienated people. Within this perversion of the word education are a number of enlightened teachers and, to a lesser extent in my experience, university lecturers. They do the best they can to lessen the indoctrination. There are schools which try to tap the full potential of their students. But, like the doctors, nurses, politicians, journalists, economists and scientists who are opening their consciousness to greater understanding, teachers and lecturers are subject to severe limitations of action by the structure and control they have to endure. As the demise of take-make-and-throwaway quickens we are hearing government ministers talking of a ‘return to basics’ in all things. This is their way of finding some illusion of security in a mythical 1950s utopia in which everyone had their place and everyone knew what it was. This back to basics policy when applied to education, puts an emphasis on ‘talking at’ teaching, an expansion of tests and exams and, to quote one Education Secretary, a return to teaching a fear of God. Give me strength. I see a very different approach surfacing as consciousness expands its understanding of life. Like everything I have discussed in this book, the transition period for education will be one of opposites. The status quo and those who support it will try to hold back change by returning to ‘basics’ as they call them. They will wish to make education even more rigid and impose more dogma as a reaction to changes that will eventually sweep it away. Against that will be a growing demand from awakening people for education to replace indoctrination. There are things we all need to learn in our early years, like how to count, write, and communicate. We also require a summary of the ideas that claim to explain what is happening around us. But, like history, these need to be presented as ideas, opinions and views, not facts, unless they can she shown to be so. You only have to read government papers which are released thirty years after events to see how the state re-writes history every day - look at the information in this book! Secret Illuminati documents which have come to light say that they have rewritten some history, perhaps to suit its own ends. To present all but the outlines of history as fact is to mislead. Children in the United States were brought up to believe the Indians were"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"316 backward savages. When those children grew up, many treated the Indians appallingly from that indoctrinated perspective. British children are taught by law in the schools that the Christian story is historical fact, not a story that Christians choose to believe. I was never told at school about Constantine’s Council of Nicaea, the Jesus-style saviour figures of the pre-Christians, or the ‘crusade’ against the Cathars. Nor are my children. Every Christmas, pupils in primary schools perform nativity plays. That’s fine if the story of the Nativity is portrayed as art, the acting-out of a Christian belief. But it isn’t. It’s mostly presented to the children as history. I am looking forward to an education which teaches written and verbal communication, the mathematics we will need in our everyday lives, and the information that will help young people to have a wide understanding of the world. They need to be given access to all views and to be encouraged to have their own opinions. In the teaching of religion, for example, the course would include explanations of what all religions believe and why. There would be no imposition of one Christian, Muslim, or Jewish dogma. Explanations of karma, reincarnation, and Earth energies would be added to the curriculum along with the principles of astrology and alternative forms of healing to allow children and students the opportunity to have access to all views, not only those which the status quo wants us to believe. Education of the future will encourage self-reliance. The basic skills people need to live without dependence on the system will be at the heart of this. How to grow food, cook, build a house, repair and maintain a home and its contents and the other skills necessary to be independent. This gives young people choices throughout their lives. The education system of today is teaching more and more about less and less. It is producing people who are dependent on earning money from one specialised skill to pay for all the other things they need. This is the opposite of independence. And look at the consequences when that skill is no longer required by take-make-and- throwaway. But making people dependent serves the system magnificently. The main motivation of the new education will be to identify and encourage the gifts the student has brought into incarnation. The students themselves will decide this. Ask young people what they most enjoy and you will invariably be looking at their natural potential. We reveal our gifts in our enthusiasms and interests. Many young people who are less than ‘successful’ at school will be doing"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"317 some marvellous things in their spare time when they are in control of what they can and cannot do. I have known people who were regarded as failures at maths at school but who can work out the odds and pay-outs for a horse race at lightning speed. This is possible because the maths involved - in this case when applied to horse racing - has become part of their enthusiasm. You may not agree with horse racing or betting, but that’s another subject. The point I am making is that, if you encourage people’s enthusiasms and use those as a basis for teaching other skills, you are going to be very much more successful than if you only talk at them from the front of the class or tell them to read text books. The new education will not concentrate on the skills demanded by throughput. There will be greater opportunities to develop gifts in the arts, crafts and sport. With everyone’s gifts encouraged, there will be no ‘failures’. Youngsters will not be leaving school thinking they have failed because the examination results say so. Once the base and diversity of knowledge has been taught, the opportunities will be there to specialise and develop to a level of excellence whatever the student has decided he or she wishes to do. But this will happen with the wide range of skills and understanding underpinning that specialisation and the choices they offer, always available. Respect and love for the Earth and all life will be encouraged throughout the new education. From an early age, children will spend time, as part of their curriculum, working in the community with old people, the infirm and those in need for whatever reason. Loving and caring for each other will be the guiding principles of education. Professional teachers won’t be the only vehicles for educating the young. In every community there are thousands of people with skills and knowledge which would benefit students. But, instead of using that wealth of knowledge, the system relies on teachers and lecturers alone to give insights into subjects for which they often have no practical experience. There needs to be a better balance between the teachers’ classroom skills and the practical experience of others in the community. It is time for the teaching profession to rebel and refuse to serve this system of indoctrination any longer. They are just being used by those in control to feed the children in their care the information the system wants them to hear and believe. Come on teachers and teachers’ unions. Refuse to be used as system fodder programmed to turn out more fodder to replace you. Stop cooperating, Say No. The"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"318 same applies to parents. Insist on real education. Stop cooperating with the programming of your children. The circle must be broken. During the transition period, I expect more people to take their children out of the state system. They will either teach them at home or get together in groups to form their own schools. These will not be giant comprehensives. They will be much smaller and more personal. A typical one could be composed of just a few families getting together. Far less of a student’s day will be spent sitting and being talked at; far more in doing and talking themselves. The move away from formal state education will increase through this decade and across the millennium. Economic collapse will add further to the demise of the present education system. Further in the future, the whole concept of education will be unrecognisable when compared to what we have today or even to the new approach to learning which I have been promoting. We need to appreciate that going through the state education indoctrination machine and coming out with examination passes and letters after your name does not, in itself, make you intelligent, wise or inspired. It can actually suppress all three. While I was writing this chapter I saw a ‘highly-qualified’ scientist giving a television lecture about the new frontiers of science. At the end he posed a number of questions which he said science will need to answer about the mysteries of life. People without his paper qualifications have been answering those questions since before he was born, but the system has not listened. In the next twenty years, it will be shown, even to the satisfaction of mainstream thinking, that the themes in this book and others about life and Creation are correct. The media could have printed these answers years ago, but they ignored them because I and people like me do not have letters after our name or have our explanations pored over in scientific journals. Nor are we supporters of the status quo. The education system of today doesn’t just indoctrinate the population during their time at school and university. It decides throughout our lives who we should listen to and who we should not, especially when science is involved. Yet, if you can access higher levels of consciousness, you can bring into this world understandings and knowledge that are light years ahead of human science, the bulk of which is only interested in the physical world.

With the frequencies rising, they are able to tune consciously much earlier in their lives to frequency levels that were denied to us. We have had to work to stay with the rising frequencies while babies today can come in at the highest levels available to this planet. They will be manifesting their higher knowledge and understanding of who they are and what they are doing here much earlier than we could. This doesn’t mean they are necessarily more evolved than many others on Earth today. It means they can connect earlier in their lives with the higher frequencies the planet is moving into. I have heard many people say that babies today are different. Well this is why. This phenomenon alone will ensure that education will become a two-way process, as it should always have been anyway. We will tell the children what we know, or think we know, and they will tell us what they know. Encouraging them to connect with their highest potential will be the most important gift we can give to them and the world. The education of the future will be designed to bring out all the skills and knowledge that we possess and to help to lead us along the life path we have chosen before incarnation.

If they can control the way you think and feel they can control your behaviour and hijack your individuality. They can take you over. ‘They’ can take many forms: entities on other frequencies, religions, elements of the New Age and the technology of mind- control under the guidance of those groups outside of governmental and democratic control who seek to rule the world. In this chapter I am looking at some of the ways ‘they’ exploit the spirit and the minds of the human race, how we can stop it happening and how ‘they’ are likely to react to the challenge of the changing consciousness that threatens their ambitions so fundamentally. It is important to know what is going on because the mind controllers in all their forms will be trying even harder today to prevent the sort of changes I have outlined in the second halfofthe book. Religions like Christianity, Islam, Judaism and so many others have only survived this long by fear, indoctrination and imposition. Without these, they would have been long gone. In their extreme forms they amount to nothing less than spiritual fascism. Their fear, guilt and prejudice have been indoctrinated through the generations over thousands of years and they have made a fundamental contribution to the division and pain on the Earth today. How ironic that those who proclaim the Jewish religion and condemn Islam could well have experienced Islamic lives in the past and vice-versa. It’s the same with Protestants and Catholics, those two expressions of the Christian creed which have often been in conflict. Whenever I see Ian Paisley, the vehement Protestant spokesman in Northern Ireland, a voice in my mind says, ‘He was apope!’. While the major religions speak of a world of spirit, they have been created by and motivated by the misunderstandings in the world of matter under the guidance of highly negative and imbalanced aspects"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"321 of the Luciferic consciousness working on the minds of those involved - not all of them, but enough. The religions have sought material and political power and that has been their driving force. They have wished to control and deny free expression. The Inquisitions, the torture and the mass murder of non-believers are evidence of that. Any creed which has to indoctrinate, frighten and impose itself through violence and genocide has no respect for human life and freedom of thought and expression, nor for the very values it is supposed to proclaim. If they are so confident that what they say is true and credible, why do they feel the need to impose it and suppress alternative explanations? The answer to that is that, without imposition, it would not be here today. We now have endless factions of Christianity, Mormons, Methodists, Baptists and more far right mind-controlling sects springing up to take advantage of humanity’s spiritual emptiness and lack of meaning, particularly among the young. ‘Give us your money, do as we say and we’ll give you all the answers because we are the representatives of God. If you don’t do what we say, you will be rejected by Jesus and go into the fires of hell.’ That sums up the basic message of so many sick and misguided groups which prey on the minds of those seeking meaning in this crazy world. Exploitation of the spirit is a growth industry. For nearly two thousand years Christianity had a free hand to force its creed upon the population of; particularly, the Western world. British people were forced to go to church by law and even today Christianity is given free air time quite outrageously day after day by the BBC and others to broadcast its propaganda. The Christian view is taught, again by law, in the schools. The Church of England is part of the institution of State. Prime Ministers are involved in the selection of bishops and the monarch is crowned as ‘Defender of the Faith’. Most people have forgotten that the church became part of the state in the first place only because Henry VIII wanted a divorce and the Pope refused to allow it. As we have seen, Henry’s decision to ignore the Pope and the determination of his daughter, Elizabeth I, to become supreme head of a Protestant Church of England led to Church and State becoming linked at all levels. To this day, bishops are given automatic places in the House of Lords and most of the clergy are often reluctant or frightened to speak out strongly against governments who abuse the values for which the Church claims to stand. There are exceptions to this, but the general rule remains."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"322 Christianity and other religions have instigated, supported or watched without challenge, some of the most horrendous atrocities against humanity and the Earth. Roman Catholicism, that most arrogant of dictatorships controlled by the Brotherhood and the notorious P2 Lodge of Freemasons. still tries to force people to behave in ways it deems acceptable. Yet, despite all its imposition, privileges and advantages, the Christian Church is crumbling before our eyes. Attendances continue to fall and churches to close because the money is no longer there to pay the bills. The Church of England has been financed mostly from its land holdings and inherited wealth. The largest part of this land, and therefore the Church’s wealth, came into its possession through force of various kinds, violent or psychological. In some cases, landowners who went off to fight for God (Christian power and influence) in the Crusades were persuaded by the Church to sign over all their land and property in the event of their death. Giving all that to the Church would ensure a place in Heaven. Purely by coincidence it would also ensure that the Church became richer. They could always come up with a biblical passage to support them: “And everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father or mother, or wife or children, or lands for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.” But falling attendances and ill-fated property speculation from the late 1980s have dramatically reduced the wealth of the Church of England, and others are also, or will soon be, in similar trouble. Around three-quarters of a billion pounds have been wiped off the Church of England’s assets and that is only what they have publicly admitted to. Parish churches have been told they will now have to raise more of their money for themselves because the central fund cannot afford to continue with donations at the level they have been in the past. Even the ability of the Church to pay pensions to its clergy has been questioned. Alongside this blow to its finances has come the public questioning of its dogma. I have said before that part of the plan for the transformation has been for some of the volunteers to incarnate with the task of becoming part of the bastions of mind-control, like the Church, the media, the monarchy, and science. They would not remember this yet but they are being activated at the right time to"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"323 undermine these organisations from within. A wonderful example of this, I believe, is the former Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins. He has attracted fierce criticism from fanatics for questioning the Christian version of the Virgin Birth, much of the Christmas story, the Second Coming and the existence of a place called Hell to which sinners are supposed to be condemned for all eternity. Like most people who stand up and speak out with courage he was only articulating what others believe but are too frightened say. It speaks much for the feeble foundations of Christianity that those who attack the Bishop say he is questioning the whole basis on which the Christian religion stands or falls. If a creed depends on events that supposedly happened two thousand years ago, as reported in a book written by who knows who and who knows when, in who knows what circumstances, it doesn’t say much for the creed, does it? But the Bishop has had the courage to keep on speaking out and, slowly, others within the Protestant and Catholic churches are beginning to do the same. The realisation is beginning to dawn that ancient texts have to be read symbolically, not literally, most of the time, and that you cannot use them as an infallible record of truth. Such people have a long way to move before they encompass the sort of themes included in this book but they are already questioning the dogmatic view of the Church. We will see more people breaking ranks and saying what they have long believed - that the dogma of the Christian creed is simply not credible. You only have to read some Christian literature to realise that: “If you ignore him (Jesus) and reject him now, at the Day Of Judgment when we must all stand before him he will ignore and reject you. ‘I do not know you, depart from me’.” (This is the ‘loving’ Jesus and the Prince of Peace?) “...after death there is no more opportunity to turn to Christ. It will be too late.” (This is clearly bad news for the babies who die after a few minutes or the little children who have not had the opportunity to know what Jesus is demanding of them. And what about the children in parts of the world who do not even know of Jesus?) “The good news of the Gospel is that Jesus, the perfrct substitute, made the ultimate once and for all payment on our behalf It cost Him His lift. As a result God gives the free gift ofsalvation to those who believe in His Son.”"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"324 (The publication from which this quote is taken included a chapter attacking alternative thought called ‘The Fine Art Of Baloney Detection’!). Throughout the Christian Church there are many thousands of people, like the Quakers, who have been attracted by the laudable values attributed to Jesus in the Gospels. They have suffered the dogma but lived the values. They have used the Church to work for the good of the community. Indeed, there are some magnificent human beings working within Christianity and other religions. These are people who would have found other ways to express their decency if the Church had never existed. They are prisoners of the dogma within the Church structure but not within their own consciousness. When that structure is no more, and that time is not far away, these Church people will be freed to live and promote the values of caring, sharing, love and tolerance without being forced to insist that everything in the Bible is true and the word of God. Such values have been devalued by the dogma which anyone with a mind they can genuinely call their own knows to be invention and not even inspired invention at that. The rising frequencies will be affecting open minded, value4ed, Church people in the same way that they are awakening others. As we have seen with the Bishop of Durham, the awakening to their role in this life will be so powerful that they will not be able to stop themselves from speaking out, no matter what the short-term consequences for them might be. Tensions will grow between this awakening consciousness within the Church and the closed minds who will seek security in the face of these changes by the promotion of dogma in its most extreme forms. The demise of the economic system will bring the political right to the surface and the religious right will rise in the wake of the Church’s collapse. Both will fail as the transition proceeds, but they could cause considerable pain and disruption in the short term. There are likely to be witch-hunts by the extremists against those within the religions who disagree with them. I see in all the religions the rejection of dogma by sensible, open- minded Muslims, Jews, Christians and others in the light of the changing consciousness. They will start to think for themselves and demand freedom of thought and expression. Summon your courage, thinkers within the Church, and speak out. The religious robots also need to rebel. The extremes will react against this challenge, creating potential for conflict. Mind-controlled fanatics who will be"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"325 befuddled even more by the rising vibrations could resort to violence and inquisition in an attempt to impose their will. There will be attempts to portray the upheavals of the transition, including the weather and geological events, as God’s reprisals against a human race which does not behave as he says, (i.e. what the religious dogmatists say). This will succeed with a few people and there will be a temporary turning to these religions by those who fear what is happening but don’t wish to take responsibility for their own thoughts and actions. I believe that the Brotherhood and the scientists of the underground bases, may use their Walt Disney technology to project illusions of great religious miracles to suggest that the Second Coming is upon us and that people must repent (for repent, read ‘do as they say’). The Brotherhood will be at the same time be using the Church and destroying it when the moment arrives to introduce its own “Messiah” or “World king”, whatever form that is supposed to take. Having manipulated the Vatican for its own ends, it will bring down the Roman Catholic Church. It is vital that people do not buy their ludicious, but sinister, alternative: “We shall not overtly lay a finger on existing churches, but we shall fight against them by criticism calculated to produce schism... only years divide us from the moment of the complete wrecking of the Christian religion. As for the other religions, we will have still less difficulty in dealing with them.” (Illuminati Protocol 17). Religion is under challenge on two fronts, the Brotherhood and the changing consciousness, and the way we react to its devise is going to decide which one will hold sway in the collective human mind. The greatest potential for trouble is from those countries where religious fascist regimes are already in control. To the people of such countries I would offer again these words: ‘100,000 Englishmen cannot control 300 million Indians if those Indians will not cooperate’. Sadly, after a lifetime, often many lifetimes, of severe indoctrination, many of those in countries controlled by the religious right have layers of conditioning to remove before they will challenge that control in large enough numbers. As always in looking ahead, exactly what will happen is impossible to say because that will depend on how many open up to the new frequencies and how humanity as a whole reacts to events."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"326 Christianity is already well aware of the consequences for its influence and existence being posed by the new consciousness. Its reaction to this has been painfully predictable. It is turning to the weapons it always uses in times of trouble - fear and misrepresentation. Nothing encapsulates this approach and what we are likely to see from the dogma-supporters in the near future better than a book called New Age versus the Gospel: Christianity’s Greatest Challenge. It was put through my letter box by a local Christian offering to ‘save’ me from my misguided ways. He did this with the best of intentions I am sure but all the book achieved was to confirm to me (a) the pathetic nature of dogmatic Christianity and (b) the way in which that dogma reacts to alternative thought. This is some of the blurb on the book cover: “Suddenly it is chic to be ‘spiritual’.” (Implication: you can only be spiritual if you are a Christian). “But the roots of today’s ‘Spirituality’ are in Paganism, and not Christianity.” (A breathtaking statement when Christianity is recycled Paganism!) “...(The New Age).. a heady mix of Hinduism, Buddhism, and the hard core occult represents the greatest threat to Christianity in the history of the faith.” (The term ‘hard core occult’ is designed to frighten people. Occult is another word, like Paganism, that Christianity has assassinated. Originally it meant ‘hidden’. To investigate occult mysteries is to say you are investigating hidden mysteries. The word occult has been changed to imply devil worship. No single body has promoted the cause of extreme negativity more than Christianity through the centuries, except the Brotherhood. And the greatest threat to Christianity is, and has always been, itself.) “Christians need to know where New Age is coming from and how to counter its claims.” (misrepresent them.) “New Age Versus the Gospel analyses the menace, comes to grips with the Gospel and points to the Powerfor revival.” (The rise of evangelical dogmatists to condemn awakening peoples as evil followers of the Devil and to condemn other members of their own creed who disagree with them as not real Christians). I have already been rebuked ‘in the name of the Lord’ by Christian evangelists and been dubbed ‘the anti-Christ’ and it was no surprise that a whole chapter was devoted to me in that book. I had to read the account about me a couple of times to confirm I wasn’t dreaming. It was hysterical. The writer said that I had claimed on a television"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"327 programme to be a ‘New Age priest’. I am more likely to call myself Nellie The Elephant than that. As you will see, I have great reservations about some areas of what is termed New Age, although not for the reasons expressed in that book. What is more, the whole idea of priests is abhorrent to me. Stand by for more of such insults to the intelligence as the Christian dogmatists cling on to their sinking ship and thrash out at all who are heading for the lifeboats. The foreword to the book was written by a cleric from All Souls Church, Langham Place, London. This is opposite the headquarters of BBC Radio and it is from All Souls that much free Christian propaganda is broadcast to the nation by the ‘independent’ BBC. The author of the foreword has a real problem with the idea that all is One and all is God. Christianity is obsessed with portraying God as an outside force which is not part of us. Humans cannot find answers from within, the book informs us, we have to be ‘rescued’ and that can only happen if we ‘find’ Jesus. Only by accepting that Jesus had to suffer horribly on the cross, in order for his father to agree to forgive the sins of the rest of us, can we be ‘saved’, apparently. He says that ‘from beginning to end, the New Age Movement expresses a preoccupation, even an infatuation, with self. It puts self in the place of God and even declares that we ARE God.” Dogmatic Christianity is based on division and lack of self-worth - a division between different parts of Creation and the belief that we are born sinners. Love of self is seen as arrogant, selfish and offensive to God. In fact, it is the lack of self love and, through that, love for others which is at the heart of humanity’s malaise. We cannot love, forgive and respect others until we can love, forgive and respect ourselves. This link between love for self and love for others is highlighted in my book Heal The World. People who are aggressive in their behaviour towards others are people who hate themselves. Their hatred of self is projected outwards in an apparent hatred of the world. Yet, I was banned from speaking at the Central Hall in Westminster, London, because I am saying love yourself; love the world. I had wanted to hire the hall for a talk. I rang them and learned that the date I wanted was available. All was going well. Then, after the details had been agreed, the lady asked for my name. When I told her, there was a silence. After a few seconds she recovered her voice but her attitude had changed. The hall was run by the Methodist Church,"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"328 she told me. I would have to write in and outline what I would be saying before permission to hire the hall would be granted. So much for freedom of speech, I thought. I wrote to them but they asked for more details. I wrote again to inform them that, in part, I would be saying that we need to love, forgive and respect ourselves if we are do the same for others. I was not surprised that the Methodist trustees of the Central Hall replied that I would not be allowed to speak there. But I was rather taken aback by the reason they gave for this ban. Part of their letter said: “....The doctrines of the evangelical faith which Methodism has held from the beginning and still holds, are based upon the Divine revelation recorded in the Holy Scriptures. The Methodist Church acknowledges this revelation as the supreme rule of faith and practice..” In other words, I take it, they believe that the Bible, despite all its contradictions, incitements to violence, and (according to research in the 19th Century) 36,191 translation errors in the King James version alone, is one hundred per cent accurate and infallible. The letter continued: “Central to the evangelical Christian doctrine is the belief that to love God is the first commandment, and that implicit trust in Him is the path to salvation. It is our feeling that the promotion of a world- view which is based on ‘self-love’ would be contrary to the Christian Gospel which Methodism seeks to expound.” What have we come to? Someone is barred from speaking because a view which involves loving, respecting and forgiving yourself and others is ‘contrary to the Christian Gospel...’. Well, if that is the case, there is something seriously wrong with the Gospels or the interpretation of them. No wonder the Church is dying on its feet when people hear this proclaimed from the pulpits; nor is it surprising that Christianity has sought and fought to crush other views that threaten to expose its gigantic confidence trick on the minds of humanity. In the face of the new consciousness, this centuries-old prison of the mind has no chance of surviving, no matter how it presents the beliefs of those who are putting a different view. In his criticism of the New Age, the cleric from All Souls gives"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"329 us an excellent insight into the misunderstandings and desperation of Christianity. He says in his introduction: “To New Agers ‘transformation’ has nothing to do with people’s morality or behaviour. It refrrs rather to the transformation of their consciousness, the discovery and development of their own potential.” He says that as a criticism? And what will a transformation of consciousness do if not change the way people think and behave? Christianity lives in a dream world in which one generation indoctrinates the next. It speaks of Divine Will and revelation when, in reality, its dogma was decided by a Roman Emperor, sundry bishops and misguided popes who sought economic and political power above spiritual insight. Its beliefs and ceremonies have their origin in the Pagan beliefs they so despise. Nothing will be affected more by the transformation, all over the planet, than Christianity and its like. Open-minded true scientists are going to be inspired to confirm that all consciousness is eternal, that Creation is made up of frequencies and that everything is the same energy in different states of being. All is One. This and other discoveries and exposures will hasten the end of Christianity. We will see real science (not the system-serving variety) and spirituality (not religion) speaking the same language. In fact, they already are. The new spirituality will have no rules and regulations. It will respect the right of all to believe what they think is correct. Its only challenge will be to those who wish to force others, through subtle and less subtle means, to believe what they want them to believe. My problem with Christianity and other dogmatic religions is not with their right to believe what they wish, but with the way they have tried to impose their beliefs through fear, violence and support from the State. Had that not been the case, this chapter would not have needed to be written, for the Christian religion would no longer be with us. During the transformation, people will be guided together, naturally, as higher selves reconnect powerfully with our physical personalities. It will be a free spirituality in which we can link with the Source and the higher levels when we are alone at home, with a few friends, or in vast groups. The choice will be ours and one will be no more valid than the other. With so many churches built on energy points, I believe many could be used by spiritual groups as Christianity continues to fold and the churches close. They could be"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"330 used for energy-channelling and healing, rather than for the obsession with events which took place two thousand years ago. They will be places of love and joy where the gift of life can be celebrated with others. They will not be places of fear and guilt which emphasise ‘sin’ at the expense of people loving themselves. With science and spirituality working as one, we will be visiting and interacting with other loving civilisations in the Universe and moving across frequencies. This will give a fantastic understanding of life and Creation compared with what we have now. Our spirituality will evolve rapidly as a result, if we are open to it. There are dangers on this road, however, even for those who accept the themes of this book. You can believe in reincarnation without serving others. You can speak of peace and love without really meaning it at the core of your being. It is easy for love and peace to become the spiritual equivalent of ‘have a nice day’. All that glitters is not gold and all that speaks of love and peace is not loving and peaceful. I have had several experiences, some very extreme, which have shown me this. So much of what is termed ‘New Age’ is merely the Old Age in disguise. It is, too often, the old thought patterns and reactions at work under a different cloak, that’s all. The New Age is a vast tapestry of people and beliefs and should not be seen as a movement or entity which thinks and believes the same. I refuse to call myself ‘New Age’ because, like tens of millions of others, I am an aspect of consciousness awakening to my true self and that does not require titles or all-encompassing ‘movements’. It requires me to follow my own intuition at all times. Within the New Age field, there is substantial exploitation and there are many who complicate simple themes. The more complicated you can make it appear, the more people will be dependent on others to decide what is best and to sell them endless paraphernalia - rebirthing tanks, counselling, karma sessions and goodness knows what else. The idea is to free people from spiritual dependency and dependency of all kinds - not to create a new dependency on a guru, teacher, channeller or piece of equipment. That is not to say that some of these New Age services are not helpful when enlightened people are involved, they certainly are. But too much is irrelevant and emotionally-dangerous exploitation. It can hold back your awakening and, in areas like karmic counselling, can, possibly, make you feel really bad about yourself if the counsellor tells you of unpleasant things he or she claims you were responsible for in past lives. It is the same with"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"331 many channellers. Much channelled information is claptrap and needs to be treated with great caution. There is a woman I met briefly with Yeva who now sends me a stream of strange letters claiming the most outrageous things. She is quite obviously in a state ofconsiderable confusion and in need of some enlightened help yet, on her business cards, she describes herself as a past life and present life counsellor. Be careful. The Brotherhood have infiltrated New Age and UFO groups and negative extra-terrestrials could have been using channellers for thousands of years. Remember, they know this consciousness shift is planned and they want to stop it because they know the consequences of it for them. What better way than to feed a load of trash through channellers and ‘gurus’ to those who are being affected by that shift? I read in one American New Age magazine some channelling, purporting to come from extra-terrestrials, that was calling for a world government. I have reservations, too, about some of the communications which allegedly come from ‘Ascended Masters’. Whenever I hear that term, I feel really bad about it. I have had bad vibes about some of the groups who have promoted this idea of ‘Masters’, not least the ‘I am’ cult in the United States. The Masters, according to New Age belief; are part of something called the Great White Brotherhood who are said to be guiding humanity and the Earth through this time of change. But are they? Someone is, for sure, but can it be the entities who are said to be Masters? I’m not yet convinced, you know. It could be that it is the hierarchal tone of Ascended Masters that makes me feel less than positive about it and maybe the blind worship of these entities is not something they wish to happen. But, even if the ideas of Masters is correct, is every channelled entity who claims to be from that consciousness stream really telling the truth? The answer to the latter is definitely No, because negative ETs and the Luciferic consciousness use some channellers tuning to the lower frequencies as a means to manipulate. Claiming to be from what is so widely accepted to be a positive consciousness stream like the Masters in an excellent way of doing it. I have no doubt that consciousness of a very high evolution is trying to guide us, and so are streams of positive, loving ETs from other Universal civilizations, but we always have to be selective and wary about who is on the other end of the line. Being spiritual is vital to the transformation but being streetwise is equally so. Once again, the key is to follow our intuition, to listen to"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"332 channelling while being very selective. It is what we feel is right within our hearts that matters and that doesn’t need the name of some Master of other to give it legitimacy. It has no name. It just is. A danger I see is that parts of the New Age could become nothing more than another religion. The signs are already there. We have the gurus, the teachers, and the ‘living gods on Earth’. We see ‘disciples’ giving over their responsibility to think and act to these people in the same way that Christians do to the Bible and Jesus, and Muslims do to the Koran and Mohammed. I have met people who have been diverted from thejourney to enlightenment by becoming obsessed with Indian gurus. I have seen how they have turned their homes into shrines to them. I am not saying that we should not listen to the views of the guru figures, but no more so than anyone else. What I challenge is the unquestioning worship of them. This is another expression of humanity’s collective desire to pass on their responsibility to others for the way they think and act. This is precisely what the Brotherhood wants. All over the New Age arena are cosy little niches where people can become trapped and cease to evolve their understanding. Some have a certain belief about karma and they stick with it, no matter what other information comes to light; some channel the same non-physical entities all their lives instead of expanding their consciousness to access higher and higher levels of information and knowledge; others mix only with those who agree with them and avoid the sometimes-unpleasant and painful necessity of taking their knowledge to sceptical audiences who have as much right to hear it as everyone else. I understand why some people find a nice little spot on the path and pitch their tent. There have been many times in the past when I have wished to step off the road and take a rest for a while from the frustration and aggravation of speaking to closed minds. But, if we are to speed the emergence of the new consciousness and free humanity from the prison of indoctrination as smoothly as p05sible, we must continually work to expand our own understanding and to pass on what we believe for others to accept or reject. No-one said it would be easy and turning the New Age into another religion or giving our responsibility to guru figures will hold back the spiritual revolution. Respect and love are the foundations of the new thinking - the worship of others is not, I would suggest. That’s the old way recycled."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"333 But the positive contribution of what is termed the New Age movement and which I term the Spiritual Renaissance far outweighs the negative. I have met thousands of wonderful, loving, non- judgmental human beings who are doing a superb job in helping people to awaken. No-one wants to stop the exploitation of the new consciousness more than they do and, whenever I talk in these terms at meetings, the audience invariably shows its enthusiastic support for this view. What I am saying is, be careful. Just because someone claims to be a channeller, astrologer, karmic counsellor or healer does not mean that they are proficient in those skills. Not even the well-known ones, necessarily. Look for those who are recommended and respected by others in their field or by previous clients. More than anything, our own intuition should be our guide. I believe we could see three clearly identifiable groups during the transition. There will be those who reject the rising frequencies and who, as the years pass, will be easy to recognise. There will be those who move so far and stop when they find a comfortable niche. And there will be others, the few probably, who go on searching, seeking and challenging, no matter what the personal consequences in the short term. The further you walk along the road the lonelier it can become, as others stop through weariness, material gain or fear. With every step, you are tuning to a higher wavelength which evolves your understanding and behaviour. From the perspective of those who have chosen to stop back down the road you may appear extreme and strange. If you keep walking and seeking, you will be ridiculed and increasingly condemned by the first group of padlocked minds. But I feel the second group, many of which will be within what is termed the New Age Movement, will also be less than supportive of those on the front of the snowplough who will be questioning many of the themes on which some New Age niches depend. The road to enlightenment is never-ending. Just as we are leaving dogmatic religion behind, so we will eventually do the same with many elements of current New Age dogma. The third example of the exploitation of the spirit and the mind is the Brotherhood with the behaviour-controlling technology I talked about in an earlier chapter. We are getting help with this from the higher levels who are taking steps to block it as the transformation proceeds. The more who ask for this to be done, the better. Mass forms of mind control can only affect us if we allow ourselves to de4ink from the frequency of love to which our heart chakras are"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"334 tuned. If we think love and live love we can resist it. Another crucial way our minds are attacked is the programming by the messages which are projected at us through the media and our general lives every day. We should not underestimate their power to exploit our minds and spirits. An Illuminati document called “Silent Weapons of Quiet Wars” was published in Beyond A Pale Horse. The document was found in 1986 in an IBM copier bought at a second hand sale. It was dated 1979. It encapsulates all that I have been saying in this book: “Experience has proven that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon and gaining control of the public is to keep them undisciplined and ignorant of basic systems principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused, disorganised, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other hand. “This is achieved by: 1. disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics, and discouraging technical creativity. 2. engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities by: (a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media - especially the TV and newspapers. (b) giving them what they desire - in excess - “junk food for thought” - and depriving them of what they really need. (c) Re-writing history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities. These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology. The general rule is that there is profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore the best approach is to create problems and then offer the solutions. “In Summary: Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters ofno real importance. Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"335 Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth grade level. Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farm with the other animals.” Recognise all that? Of course you do. It is the world we live in and it is exactly what the Illuminati have sought to create. If we are going to repel this form of spiritual and mental exploitation we must start to think for ourselves; to get involved and to get informed about what is really going on; to make sure our children are informed and realise how they are being manipulated; to get off our knees and start to use our minds to their full potential; to reject the pressure to accept the drip, drip, drip of trivia designed to deaden our consciousness. The best way to challenge the negative is with joy, laughter, peace - and knowledge. The negative does not understand love and peace. And never underestimate your own potential and the power of your own psyche. You own it. It belongs to no-one else, not a church, guru, ascended master, piece of technology or ET. You are connected through your higher self to all Creation. Tap into that and no-one, but no-one, can exploit your spirit."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"336 20 The Earth Needs Rebels “All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing” - Edmund Burke. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and a transformation of human understanding can begin with one thought and one rebel. Every improvement in the human condition has come from someone pushing against the tide and speaking out, no matter what the consequences. That person is within all of us. Rebellion and the desire for positive change is at the heart of the human spirit. But what is rebellion? The meaning of the word is often misunderstood. Many of those who once came to heckle and laugh when I have spoken in public have been under the impression that they were rebels. Yet they are system servers doing exactly what they are programmed to do - undermining anyone prepared to challenge its control. Beers and jeers don’t make a rebellion. Others see rebels as those who wage war against the State. I am sure those in Northern Ireland who daily kill and maim think they are rebels. But, again, they are merely puppets of the Luciferic consciousness and the Brotherhood working through both sides. The rebellion of which I speak does not involve armed uprisings or violence of any kind. It is a rebellion against indoctrination and mind control; a refusal to be programmed a moment longer by the ‘values’ imposed upon us by other generations and by the super robots in politics, economics, science, religion and the Brotherhood networks. Thinking for yourself and having the confidence and courage to live what you believe - that’s rebellion. From this will come change in every aspect of life on Earth. Such"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"337 rebellion will show itself in this transition period in a refusal to cooperate with the system and the Brotherhood elite. Awakening people will seek ways of disconnecting themselves as much as possible from dependency upon its destructive delusions. They will have the courage to speak loudly and confidently, for they will know that the Robots’ Rebellion cannot be stopped. It is not for me to tell people what to do. I have no desire or stomach for that. But I support the campaign of non-cooperation and peaceful resistance which is gathering across the world. I believe it will continue to grow and that some of its manifestations could be: * A boycott of all banks which create money out of nothing and charge interest on it. I hope people will withdraw their money from these banks and even refuse to pay interest on their loans. The latter decision needs to be well coordinated so that millions do it at the same time. * Support for community banks and ethical banking which invest in projects designed to benefit people and the planet. * A refusal to cooperate with and in schools, universities and government departments in every country, until we have the free flow of information about what is really going on in secret and all the knowledge available. * Constant sit-ins, peaceful occupation and mass protests at government headquarters in every country, particularly the key players like the United States, Russia, Britain, Australia, Japan, the European Community and the United Nations. * The peaceful disruption of all occasions of state in every country until we are told the truth and the closing down, by mass sit-ins, of roads and entrances to parliamentary buildings. * Mass peaceful resistance to projects that harm the environment. If they face such protests everywhere, the authorities will soon have to re-think and listen. * The boycotting of all court proceedings that may arise from such actions and mass sit-ins at the court buildings to disrupt them, also. * The bombardment of phone-in programmes and audience participation programmes with questions and information about the secret government and what people can do to stop its manipulation. * Protests and sit-ins at the headquarters of media organisations until they refuse to be Brotherhood poodles and start to report the truth to people. Boycotts of system-serving newspapers. * The same at the headquarters and branches of the Freemasons in"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"338 each country and district and the immediate resignation by all members of the Freemasons and other secret organisations who no longer wish to be used as a front for the manipulation of the world. * A refusal to vote for or support any politician who refuses to disclose whether he or she is a member of a secret society or closely- connected to anyone who is. A refusal to support any politician who is a member of any Brotherhood front organisation, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission or, in London, connected to the Royal Institute of International Affairs. The three most important words here are peaceful, determined and constant. Those who serve either knowingly or, more often, unknowingly, the forces who control us do not deserve our hatred. They need our love and we should protest with laughter and joy. They know not what they do and they are in prison as well. I always find it sad that some who protest against the activities of far right groups, do so with aggression and hatred in their hearts - the very same emotions that motivate the far right. We need to protest with love because that is the energy we wish to spread across the world. But our love must not be blind, it must be streetwise. We must remember that in the world of the Brotherhood black is white and white is black. Remember this also: Silence is convenience. It is time to think, to take responsibility, and to speak and act against the silent, secret, tyranny. The Brotherhood acknowledge the threat to their ambitions of individuals thinking for themselves and responding with action: “(We wish to) discourage any kind of personal initiative which might hinder our affair. There is nothing more dangerous than personal initiative; if it has genius behind it, such initiative can do more than can be done by millions of people among whom we have sown discord.” (Protocol 5). One individual can make a difference. We are not helpless, and the manipulation is not invincible, nor the ills of the world insurmountable. It depends on your state of mind. Problems can become solutions. If we are going to return freedom to the Earth, we have seriously to harass the system into realising that the robots are not cooperating any more. We will not be lied to and manipulated. There are billions"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"339 of us and only a relative handful who operate the secret world government. They cannot impose their will on us unless we allow them to. Are you going to be a robot or a rebel? That is your choice for there will be no in-betweens. Rebellion may appear on the surface to be the opposite of peace and love, but I don’t believe that it is. Through this book I have strongly questioned the thought-patterns which control economics, politics, the media, science, religion and parts of the New Age. Some may see this as judgmental. But we are all responsible for what has happened since Atlantis and we have all done things we would rather not have done. It is pointless trying to be holier than thou and judging others from that lofty and misguided per-’ spective. Speaking out against negative thought-patterns is not being judgmental or unloving. After all, what is love? Is it loving to ignore what these patterns are doing to people and the planet? Is it loving to say that all is well and that there is no need to change what we do? Is it loving to avoid upsetting some people when, by speaking out, you may be able to alert others to the dangers and the exploitation? I think not. There are times when love is calling a spade a shovel if that is what is needed for positive change. One of the most important channelled messages I have been given said: “True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, but it will always give that which is best for it.” Or, to add some humility to that, what we believe is best for it. I have met many people who think that protest and direct action, even of the peaceful kind I am advocating, is unloving. I would not agree with that and I feel that unless we begin a campaign of noncooperation with the system, we will allow the Brotherhood elite to do some desperately unpleasant things in the wake of our inaction. There have been some negative themes running through this book, but they are not there to frighten, they are there to inform and alert. Have no fear. A new dawn awaits us and it will bring an end to such horrors. We are on the threshold of incomprehensible change as Mother Earth moves back into alignment with the rest of the Universe and raises her consciousness to a higher dimension of love and harmony. When you think of all the wonderful things that happen in the world, even against the background I have described, think what life will be"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"340 like when that disruption and disharmony is no more. That day is near. We will see the truth that humanity is not evil or stupid, but loving, intelligent and overflowing with the love and creativity which it is desperate to express. It may not seem like that sometimes, but there are reasons for this, as we have seen, and the period of Luciferic opportunity is almost over. We shall love the Earth and love each other. We shall love those who love us and love those who hate us. We shall not choose between them, for all are we and we are all. We are each other and the truth of that is re-emerging in our consciousness. Open your heart, follow your heart, and your life and all life on this planet will be transformed. We are here to change the world. We chose to come and our time has come. We cannot and we will not fail."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"341 Bibliography Allan, Derek & Delair, when the Earth Nearly Died - Compelling Evidence of World Catastrophe, 10,500BC: Gateway Books, Bath.
