Our apparently ‘physical’ reality is a decoded projection of waveforminformation fields – the Metaphysical Universe. Body-Mind decodes waveforminformation into electrical, digital and holographic reality within a tinyfrequency band called visible light.[../Images/00075.jpg][../Images/00421.jpg]The ‘physical’ (holographic) world only exists when it is ‘observed’ (decoded)and that includes the human body. When any part of our ‘physical’ reality is notbeing decoded it exists only in its waveform state.[../Images/00394.jpg]We see the world as ‘solid’, but that is a holographic illusion decoded fromwaveform information. The world is but a dream within a dream.[../Images/00005.jpg]We are Infinite Awareness having an experience within a particular band offrequency. Our name, sex, race, culture, religion, job and ‘life story’ are not‘who we are’, but merely a brief focus of attention. Body-Mind acts like a lensto focus attention on the frequency range of visible light and people confusethis with ‘who they are’. We are not Ethel Jones or David Icke – we are InfiniteAwareness, the All That Is, Has Been And Ever Can Be – All Possibility.[../Images/00167.jpg]Everything within in our reality is a holographic expression of waveforminformation. Planets and stars are waveform/electrical/digital phenomena and asthey move and interact they change the nature of the universalwaveform/electrical/digital information fields to which ourwaveform/electrical/digital levels are connected. In doing so, they influenceour states of being. We call this ‘astrology’.[../Images/00002.jpg]Our ‘astrological field’, absorbed at birth (some say conception), interactswith the ever-changing universal field in a different way to someoneborn/conceived at a different point in the cycle’.Everything, no matter how ‘solid’ it may appear to be, is the holographicprojection of waveform information and so at the waveform level everything isconnected. This is how it is possible to communicate with animals and what iscalled the natural world. This is not done by voice to ‘ear’ communication, butat the waveform and electromagnetic levels of reality which are ultimately thesame energy source or, as some have called it, the collective unconscious whichconnects all expressions of itself.[../Images/00056.jpg]There is no time or space. These are decoded illusions, just as a computer gameappears to have time and space when it is only information encoded on a disk. Wethink that what we see in the night sky is a fantastic distance away and yet itall exists in a small area of the brain which is decoding waveform informationinto holographic ‘visual reality’.[../Images/00148.jpg]Earth people once interacted with reality through the heart vortex, theHeart-Mind, and the brain served the heart instead of dominating perception asit has since the Archon hijack.[../Images/00302.jpg]Crucial to the takeover by the demented ‘Hannibal Lecter’ Archons was a schismin the waveform fabric of our reality which triggered a series of cataclysmicevents that destroyed the ‘Avatar’ global society and humanity had to startagain.[../Images/00055.jpg]The schism or massive distortion at the waveform level was decoded through intoholographic distortion – monumental ‘physical’ upheavals and a transformation ofhumanity’s sense of self and reality.[../Images/00008.jpg]The Archons engaged in genetic manipulation to shut down much of the humanreceiver-transmitter system and re-tune RNA/DNA to a fake reality – the Matrix.Humans were now living in a manufactured illusion while believing it to be‘real’. They still are.[../Images/00386.jpg]It is believed that the genetic tinkering must have been done throughprocreation or ‘physical’ techniques like gene spicing; but if you broadcastinformation on the frequency of RNA/DNA you can mutate the body through acollective download.[../Images/00081.jpg]The Archons changed the nature of the Saturn sun and made it a broadcastingtransmitter of fantastic power.[../Images/00343.jpg]Saturn is a gigantic inter-reality gateway and broadcasting unit which is theprime source of the fake reality – the Matrix. The rings are a sound (waveforminformation) system which is being amplified by the Moon and decoded by thehuman Body-Mind. This is what I call ‘The Hack’.[../Images/00104.jpg]The Matrix and what lies beyond the Ouroboros or ‘Ring-Pass-Not’.[../Images/00105.jpg][../Images/00133.jpg]Another effect of the Saturn-Moon Matrix is to act as a firewall to the greaterreality in the same way that much of the Internet is firewalled by the Chinesegovernment and so denied to the population.[../Images/00261.jpg]The Matrix entraps human perception in a hamster’s wheel of repetition,predictability and severe limitation of both potential and a sense of thepossible. This, in turn, leads to a self-identity of ‘little me’ and ‘I can’t’.[../Images/00430.jpg]The Archons are broadcasting an information blueprint encoded with thetransformation of our reality to an Orwellian world of total control. They andtheir hybrid agents are working to tune the population into this blueprintfrequency band so they will decode into holographic being their own globalprison. What is called ‘preemptive programming’ – as with the stream of moviesportraying the society the Archons wish to create – is all part of this.[../Images/00425.jpg]The Saturn-Moon Matrix gives new meaning to the phrase ‘getting out of the box’.[../Images/00268.jpg]Words are decoded sound vibrations and they are used to program perception andunderpin the vibrational hamster wheel.[../Images/00108.jpg]The language codes embedded in human RNA/DNA manifest as the sound vibrationthat we call words which, in turn, further encodes RNA/DNA through a constantlyself-perpetuating feedback loop. It is a powerful form of subliminalself-programming.[../Images/00001.jpg]The Earth beyond the frequency wall of the Matrix (the speed of light) is verydifferent to the one that we are experiencing within the Matrix.[../Images/00223.jpg]Not everyone is enslaved by the Matrix. Those who open their minds and expandtheir range of awareness can connect with information, knowledge and insightbeyond the Matrix and therefore see what others cannot see. These people areusually called ‘mad’, ‘fantasists’ or ‘dangerous’ by those aware only of thefake reality. They are also described as ‘awakened’ by those with greaterperception.[../Images/00072.jpg]People (awareness) can still be trapped in reality ‘bubbles’ even after leavingthe body if their point of attention remains fixed on the illusion.[../Images/00122.jpg]The reality ‘bubble’ can be easily escaped by transferring your point ofattention from ‘physical’ self-identity to that of Infinite Awareness – the AllThat Is.[../Images/00184.jpg]The compartments, or ‘alters’, of trauma-based mind control. Many politiciansare subjected to this and others throughout ‘The System’.[../Images/00170.jpg]The Archon-manipulated global society seeks to close minds to expanded awarenessand sense of the possible. When people succumb to this they have no filter,challenge or alternative explanation to see or expose the lies of the system forwhat they are.[../Images/00140.jpg]The most severely closed minds can be found in the essential pillars of thesystem – the left-brain prisoners within ‘science’, medicine, politics,corporations, finance, religion and here with the mainstream media.[../Images/00393.jpg]A major gateway to subconscious human perception is through symbols and imageswhich are information fields that enter the brain through the sight senses –just as sound enters the brain through the ears.[../Images/00345.jpg]The information fields of symbolism and images bypass the conscious mind toimplant perceptions in the subconscious while the target has no idea this ishappening. When people hear sound within the frequency range of the consciousmind at least they are aware of it; but with symbols they overwhelmingly enterthe subconscious to secretly influence perception.[../Images/00064.jpg]The greatest expression of the Saturn Control System along with finance isreligion and the covert worship of Chronos, the bearded god of Saturn.[../Images/00090.jpg]The cube, six-pointed star and associated symbols and digital codes representthe standing waves of the Saturn-Moon sound frequencies. But when you awaken toConsciousness the Control System is immediately breached.[../Images/00234.jpg]The Archon hijack and the Saturn-Moon Matrix have transferred the prime point ofhuman interaction with reality from the heart to the belly – ‘the emotions’.[../Images/00135.jpg]A heart society is founded on love in its widest sense while a belly society isfounded on low-vibrational emotion.[../Images/00216.jpg]The Archons have turned the ‘Avatar’ heart society into the belly society thatwe see today which is dominated by fear and emotional reaction.[../Images/00390.jpg]The Archons know that if they can manipulate humanity into low-vibrationalemotion they will block access to the heart centre and the love, awareness,insight and innate intelligence that will connect with ‘home’.[../Images/00016.jpg]The sub-reality ‘bubble’ that the Archons and their hybrids are working tocreate between the Earth and the ionosphere.[../Images/00201.jpg]The Archon realm is very close to this one in terms of frequency and tomass-control humanity the population must be manipulated into low and densevibrational states which connect them to the Archon realm and the Saturn-MoonMatrix. This is why awakened people with awareness that expands beyond theArchon realms have been targeted by authority throughout what we callknown-history through death, condemnation and ridicule.[../Images/00287.jpg]Satanism is the most powerful expression of Archontic control because it isdirectly interacting with the Demiurge/Archons.[../Images/00040.jpg]The Archons are ‘made from luminous fire’ and they are the hidden ‘gods’, or‘God’, worshipped knowingly by Satanists and largely unknowingly by religionsand even most members of secret societies.[../Images/00288.jpg]The Demiurge, the Judeo-Christian ‘Devil’ or ‘Satan’ (and ‘God’), possesses theSaturn sun which is an interreality portal and broadcaster of the Matrix ‘Hack’.[../Images/00256.jpg]All the elements that dictate and enslave human society are ultimatelycontrolled by the same Archontic force and they are forms of worship and serviceto that force. Prime among them are Satanism and its offshoot paedophilia.[../Images/00215.jpg]People can see the human hierarchy of power, including political leaders androyalty, but they are but projections within human reality of the Archonhierarchy.[../Images/00110.jpg]The global Control System symbolised as a spider’s web.[../Images/00363.jpg]The apparently all-powerful political leaders are just little boys and girlsdoing what ‘teacher’ demands.[../Images/00048.jpg]The Saturn-Moon Matrix as it currently plays out.[../Images/00049.jpg]The Archons and their hybrids are working to project their world of death anddestruction into our reality. They are computer-like, machine-like, psychopathicparasites without creativity, empathy or compassion. Look around and you’ll seehow the Archon world is becoming our world by the day. The Archon plan is tochange our reality vibrationally and atmospherically to become closer and closerto their reality – Eben Alexander’s ‘Realm of the Earthworm’s Eye View’.[../Images/00361.jpg]The Transhumanist part-human, part-machine agenda.[../Images/00205.jpg]The many and various aspects of Agenda 21 and the Archon world being imposedupon human society.[../Images/00381.jpg]The energetic transformation that I call the Truth Vibrations, symbolised hereby the lions, are awakening ever greater numbers of people to see and challengethe Archon agenda for human society.[../Images/00304.jpg]Open your heart and open your mind to your true and infinite self and the Archonhouse of cards must fall.[../Images/00229.jpg]Open your heart, listen to your heart, and the power of the program is no more.[../Images/00293.jpg]We are the ‘dazzling darkness’ of the All That Is and multiple expressions ofexperienced reality.

Once you break free of this mental and emotionalenslavement then the PRS and TT techniques – and all the others – can be seen50-feet-high in flashing neon lights.Perception enslavement in the left side of the brain is crucial to the Archonticgame plan. The brain has two hemispheres with a bridge connecting them calledthe corpus callosum (Fig 508). These hemispheres have very different functionsor personalities and we are supposed to be whole-brained people to give us thebest aspects of both. This is, however, not what the Archons want and so withmost people this doesn’t happen. They are slaves to the structure-obsessed leftside of brain and this is reflected in the hierarchical structure of humansociety. The right-brain sees ‘wholes’, not parts, and in doing so can connectthe dots in ways that the left-brain cannot. The right-brain is random,spontaneous, creative, inspirational and the unpredictable maverick.Psychologists call the right-brain ‘subjective’ – ‘Proceeding from or takingplace in a person’s mind rather than the external world’ and ‘expressing orbringing into prominence the individuality of the artist or author’. Theright-brain is far more closely aligned with the reality of the heart than theleft-brain and so that’s the last place the Archons and their bloodlines wanthumanity to be. The right-brain can take you ‘out there’ into other realms ofAwareness and this is where the true nature of life ‘on Earth’ can be perceivedand understood. If your right-brain is not open and powerfully functioning youcan never locate the levels of the rabbit hole from where the conspiracyoriginates. So the Archons seek to lock people away in the left side of thebrain. This is not only to keep us in the proverbial ‘box’, although that iswhat the left-brain becomes when operating in isolation. The function andpersonality of the isolated left-brain also reflect the Archons and their ownpersonality and methods of operation. The left-brain gives us the perception ofeverything being apart from everything else with ‘space’ in between – theillusion of the Matrix. It cannot see wholes, only parts; it cannot seepictures, only dots; and it just loves structure. Oh, yes, it gets off on it, infact. The left-brain is logical (from its perspective of logic); rational (fromits perspective of rational); and it is ‘sequential’ in that it takes eventshappening in the eternal NOW and puts them in a sequence that we perceive astime. The quicker it makes that sequence move the quicker ‘time’ seems to passand vice-versa. The left-brain is also ‘objective’ – ‘based on observablephenomena, presented factually: an objective appraisal’. What is the basis ofmainstream ‘scientific’ belief? That which is based on observable phenomena,presented factually: an objective appraisal. Mainstream ‘science’ is amanifestation of left-brain imprisonment and so cannot unlock the foundation‘secrets’ (secret only to the left-brain and the closed mind) of our experiencedreality. The left-brain is human society as it is currently lived and structured(along with the reptilian brain), and it is here that the information Matrix, orthe Hack, becomes the constructed illusion of experienced holographic ‘physical’reality. When American brain-scientist Jill Bolte-Taylor had a stroke caused bya haemorrhage in the left side of her brain in 1996 she stopped seeing ‘normalreality’. The left-brain was no longer decoding information through the digitalto the holographic and suddenly she could no longer define where she ended andthe rest of the room began. She said that ‘the atoms and the molecules of my armblended with the atoms and molecules of the wall’, and all she could see was aunified field of energy. She said that what she called her ‘brain chatter’stopped as if someone had pressed the mute button. Brain chatter – the bodysoftware program talking to itself while people believe this to be their ownthoughts – comes overwhelmingly from the left side of the brain. Jill said:[../Images/00131.jpg][../Images/00164.jpg]Figures 508:The two hemispheres of the brain and the bridge between them, the corpuscallosum.> I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of energy around me.

The consequences of this include a sense ofsevere limitation – ‘I can’t’, ‘it can’t’, ‘that’s not possible’ – and a senseof ‘little me, I have no power’. If you plug people into the left-side of thebrain to the point where it dominates their perception of reality you plug theminto the Matrix with no other point of reference to understand what is going on.This is what has happened and so we live in a left-brain society populated byleft-brain people and institutions.Learning to be stupidThe left-brain can be very stupid when disconnected from a powerful connectionto the right-brain just as Body-Mind can be when disconnected from the influenceof Consciousness. But when the two hemispheres work in unity they can be anamazing combination, as with Body-Mind and Consciousness, and heart, brain andcentral nervous system. We are back to a key theme – distortion and inversion.The manipulation of the two hemispheres and the communication bridge betweenthem is yet another distortion of how things were meant to be. This is theArchons to a tee and they have put guards at the gate to the left-brain to blockout right-brain influence. The domination of the right-brain has its imbalances,too, as we see with people who are incredibly creative but struggle to functionin the world as it is because they are leftbrain deficient (‘ungrounded’) and sothey cannot put their creativity into action. We need to be whole-brained tobalance out both left and right distortions. I emphasise again that to observethe traits of the left-brain is to observe human society as moulded by theArchons and their bloodlines. The left-brain is obsessed with time; it cannotsee that everything is connected; it loves structure and hierarchies; and itdeals only in what it believes to be logical, rational and based on observablephenomena – can I see it, touch it, taste it, smell it, hear it? Yes? Well itmust exist, then. This is the pea-size, five-sense perception of mainstream‘science’, academia, medicine, politics, law, media and all the otherinstitutions that dictate reality to the masses. Humanity overwhelmingly lives,individually and collectively, in a left-brain prison and the keys aresystematically thrown away at a very early age. We are mostly born to parentswho have already been subjected to left-brain programming. They pass on thisperception of reality to their children because they believe their ownprogrammed perceptions are ‘logical’ and ‘rational’ and based on ‘observableevidence’. Their teachers told them so, and their university lecturers andprofessors. Scientists say the same and the media, too, because journalists donot investigate the validity of the official view – they simply repeat it asfact. Children download these perceptions from the earliest age through theinfluence of their parents and then at around age four they enter theprogramming sausage machine bravely known as ‘education’. For the rest of theirchildhood and at least most of their teenage years they will have their parents’perceptions confirmed at all the stages from pre-school to university. Most oftheir friends and acquaintances – often all of them – will be confirming thoseperceptions of reality because they are going through the same programmingsystem or have been through it already. All day, every day the mainstream mediain all its forms is confirming the same perceptions and ridiculing or condemninganyone who questions them. Most of the so-called ‘alternative’ media is thesame. I read a comment about me on an ‘alternative’ website when what I had saidabout Jimmy Savile and his paedophilia and necrophilia was being shown to beaccurate. The comment said: ‘He has been writing about Savile since way back,and has been proven correct.’ This is the left-brain speaking because I did knowabout Savile long before he was publicly outed by the colossal weight ofevidence. The left-brain couldn’t deny this because it was ‘an observablephenomena, presented factually: an objective appraisal’. But the comment alsocalled me a ‘Lizard spotter and much-loved lunatic’ because I had ‘a tendency tobang on about lizards’. The left-brain can’t deal with that or compute itbecause the very concept is way beyond the walls of its concrete and coagulatedsense of the possible. The ‘alternative media’ is overwhelmingly dominated bythe left-brain, too, and that will never be able by itself to get even close tothe depth and scale of what is actually going on. This is why I have beenridiculed and dismissed by the mainstream media and most of the alternativemedia. Both take their reference point for what is rational or irrational,credible or crazy, from the left-brain ‘norms’ of ‘science’ and academia ortheir particular religion. All religion is a manifestation of the left-brainbecause if the right-brain was engaged the illusory divisions between‘different’ religions would be clearly seen along with the endless connectionsand common themes.The ‘education’ programming machine is absolutely vital to ‘The System’ becauseit is designed to implant perceptions of reality at the earliest age to ensurethat the mind-fodder will either run the system as adults in accordance with thegame plan or they will be good little slaves for the rest of their lives whilebelieving themselves to be free (Fig 509). American writer H L Mencken describedit well when he said: ‘The aim of public education is not to spreadenlightenment at all; it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible tothe same level, to breed a standard citizenry, to put down dissent andoriginality.’ All in all you’re just another brick in the wall, as Pink Floydput it (Fig 510). In fact, those running the system and those being run by thesystem are all slaves. It is only a matter of degree. The Archontic force doesnot want people to be educated in a way that opens their eyes to their plight.In the days of official slavery it was illegal to educate a slave or teach themto read and today’s ‘education’ system is a more subtle version of that –although not so subtle if you know what you are looking at. There is a rewardand punishment system for those who accept the programming and those who don’t.The process of mainstream ‘education’ swamps the left side of the brain with thesystem’s version of reality by communicating ‘logical’ and ‘rational’information based on ‘observable evidence’. Students are then told to retainthis information and revise it thoroughly before taking something called an‘exam’ in which they must repeat to the system what the system has told them tobelieve (Fig 511). If they do this really well they pass their exams and‘progress’. Well done, Johnny, well done Jane, good marks. If they go on doingthis really well they might even go to university and get a degree to mark theirdegree of programming. How programmed are you? I’ve got a first class degree.Oh, first class programming, well done you. A study by Kyung Hee Kim, professorof education for the College of William and Mary in Virginia, focused on thecreativity of school age children between kindergarten and 12th grade using themeasurement known as the Torrance Tests of creative thinking. He found a‘massive’ decline of creativity the longer the students progressed through theschool system as ‘children have become less emotionally expressive, lessenergetic, less talkative and verbally expressive, less humorous, lessimaginative, less unconventional, less lively and passionate, less perceptive,less apt to connect seemingly irrelevant things, less synthesizing, and lesslikely to see things from a different angle’. These are nearly all traits of theright hemisphere of the brain which the education (programming) systemsuppresses to allow the left-brain to dominate perception (Fig 512). Youngpeople all over the world stress and worry waiting for their exam resultsdesperately hoping that they have successfully told the system what it has toldthem to believe while their innate gifts and talents are never activated. AlbertEinstein said: ‘Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability toclimb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.’ I leftschool aged 15 (couldn’t wait) to play professional football and never took amajor exam in my life. Phew, what an escape. Exam passes and degrees allow youto choose a specialisation of science, medicine, academia, or even politics andmedia which are dominated by degree-passers. Would-be scientists, doctors,academics and the like then take more exams and tell their specialityinstitutions what they have told them to believe. If they do this very well theybecome a ‘scientist’, a doctor, a lawyer, a professor of something or other, andthey may even be so successful that they go on to run those institutions. Howlovely, except for one little problem:[../Images/00236.jpg]Figure 509: Just another brick in the wall.[../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 510: Hey, teacher – leave those kids alone.[../Images/00030.jpg]Figure 511: The ‘education’ system – little boxes, little boxes, little boxesall the same.[../Images/00391.jpg]Figure 512: ‘I must serve the system, I must serve the system, I must serve thesystem ...’It’s all BOLLOCKS.This ‘rational logic’ based on ‘observable evidence’ is illusion. What isconsidered ‘rational’ is merely a point of observation dictated by your sense ofwhat is real. If that sense of reality is bloody nonsense to start with then sowill be your ‘rationality’, and the same with what is perceived to be ‘logical’.This is in keeping with the so-called ‘Icke’s Law’, discovered by a man calledDavid Icke after much experience and observation, which contends that bollocksbegets bollocks. It is, apparently, closely associated with the law of cause andeffect. Now, what is this about ‘observable phenomena, presented factually’?Observed by whom, pray? Scientists and academics who start out, like all humans,being able to decode next-to-fuck-all compared with what exists in the ‘space’they are looking at? Humans who then proceed through a process called‘education’ and ‘specialisation’ that leads them down an ever-narrowing myopiafrom seeing next-to-fuck-all and on and on and ever closer to seeing fuck-allitself? I do believe it is. This is done by what I call a firewall lobotomywhich makes the right side of the brain – the big picture, ‘out there’ side – apassenger on the back of the bus bored out of its mind and desperately hopingthe bus stop will appear soon so it can get off. The bus stop is the cemeteryfor most people and only then does the left-brain guy, with the crazed eyes andgoofy face, get his hand off the wheel. Even then this usually requires a pairof pliers before the funeral can proceed. The Archon genetic manipulation (andthe structure of human society) has closed off untold volumes of communicationbetween the two hemispheres through the corpus collosum and there are billionsof cells in this hemisphere bridge that appear to be inactive. The system alsoputs guards at the gate to the left-brain, called scientists, teachers,academics and the media to defend the left-brain from right-brain influence (Fig513). Ridicule and dismissal of right-brain perceptions are thrown in as aback-up system. If the village idiot told you what was rational, logical andbased on observable evidence you wouldn’t accept that without question; buthumanity in general does precisely that with the idiot institutions that dictatehuman reality, or the sense of it. These left-brain crazies are simply repeaters– repeating what the system has told them to believe is real. We have repeaterscientists; repeater academics; repeater doctors; repeater ‘journalists’;repeater everybodies. There is no original thought or insight, just repetitionof the program. A definition of the word ‘academic’ is: ‘Conforming to a setrules and traditions; conventional’. Got it in one. How can that mentality evertake us forward? Oh, the technology might change, but not the basic premise.Refuse to repeat and refuse to conform to this institutionalised bullshit andinstead of the carrot you get the stick. You don’t pass your exams (you are a‘failure’) and you are considered a disruptive influence in the classroombecause you dare to question what you are being told. You are ridiculed byprogrammed teachers and fellow students. If you are in the public eye you areridiculed by the programmed media. This is, as I dubbed it a long time ago,psychological fascism. The left-brain lacks what the right-brain has inlimitless abundance – creative imagination. The Archons and their bloodlinesseek to exploit human creative imagination because they don’t have any, but thisexploitation is only on their terms. They don’t want humanity to creativelyimagine a world of peace, joy and freedom because their game would be up.Instead they feed information and perception programs to the subconscious to tapinto the process through which human creative imagination manifests reality.This is how they are manipulating humanity to build our own prison bysubliminally connecting us with their information blueprint – a subconscioussense of reality in which humans are enslaved. This is the world portrayed by somany movies in the last 20 years and more all the time. The idea is to programthat sense of reality so we manifest it as our experienced reality. They areterrified of us accessing our own infinite powers of conscious imagination andso creating a very different reality to the one they seek to impose. The idea isto suppress conscious imagination and exploit subconscious imagination. The keyto this suppression of conscious imagination is the suppression of theright-brain and the dominance of the worker-ant, know-your-place left-side whichis far more influenced by the reptilian segment of the brain. They both lovehierarchical structures for a start.[../Images/00397.jpg]Figure 513: The left-brain guards at the gate.A Saturn returnThe outrage that is ‘homework’ is designed to eat further into the right-brain‘being’ time of children and young people. You mean six or seven hours a day,five days a week for 15 years or more is not enough – they have to work at homeas well?? Observe, too, how art and music have been reduced in scale and fundingin the ‘education’ system and how very young children are introduced toleft-brain ‘learning’ at an ever earlier age. Art and music have the potentialto stimulate the right-brain and allow children to play unmolested by ‘facts’and structure and their conscious imagination to flow. The system wants to blockthis and stimulate the left-brain so that it becomes the omnipotent force andarbiter of reality for the rest of their lives. Teachers in general don’t knowthey are doing this because they have already been through the same programmingmachine; but those who ultimately impose this system know exactly what the gameis. Children should not go near academia until at least age seven or eight andeven then it should be a very different kind of academia (so unrecognisable fromtoday’s version that you would not call it academia). Until then, they should beallowed to play, ad-lib and free-think until their creative imagination is onfire. Then the left-brain will take its rightful place as a servant and not amaster. A new curriculum being imposed in the United States makes it compulsoryfor at least 70 percent of the books to be non-fiction – so deleting the verybooks most likely to stimulate conscious imagination in the right hemisphere.They are to be replaced with technical books ‘more suited to preparing studentsfor the workplace’. I hear that so much ... the need for education to prepareyoung people for the workplace or changing education to teach the skills ‘thatemployers want’. What that really means is preparing them to become a cog in themachine with no capacity to free-think, tap into their innate creativity or opentheir minds to see how the dots fit together. Erica Goldson, the top student inher year at the Coxsackie-Athens High School in New York State, took theopportunity to demolish the education system in her 2010 valedictory speechwhile her teachers squirmed behind her once they realised what she was saying.It’s a brilliant summary of what Archon education really is and you can watch iton YouTube. The education system is not tailored to develop the multiple skillsand unique gifts of the individual but to turn every individual into part of aclueless, dumbed-down mass which is just intelligent enough to be a slave buttoo stupid to see that they are. The left-brain connects us to what we perceiveas the external world and that is okay so far as it goes; but once it becomesthe dictator of perception in this ‘external world’ that’s when the troublestarts. Would you let your computer tell you what to think of your emails orwhere to go on the Internet? No, but that is, in effect, what is happening whenpeople allow Body-Mind and especially the left side of the brain to dictatetheir sense of reality. The Sefer Yetzirah, or the Book of Formation orCreation, is the most ancient text of the Hebrew Kabbalah and it describessomething called the ‘Binah’ which has been connected to Saturn either literallyor through its influence. Binah is often symbolised as being dark or black andcontaining the hidden. The Sefer Yetsirah says that the Earth ‘... sits on thethrone of Binah’. This is interesting because Binah is described as a state ofperception akin to the conscious ‘five-sense’ mind in contrast to ‘Chochma’ –expanded, creative awareness. This breaks down as Binah (left-brain) and Chochma(right-brain/heart) and so how interesting that Binah is associated with Saturngiven what I am saying about what I call the Saturn-Moon Matrix. The MatrixControl System seeks to entrap humanity in the left side of the brain – theBinah, or Saturn influence. The Zohar, another part of the Kabbalah, says thatone of the names of God (the gods) connected to the Binah is ‘El-ohim’ (theDemiurge-Archons-Saturn). Add the left-brain to its cell-mate, the reptilianbrain, and you pretty much have the human condition. This is not by accident,but by design. It is very instructive to compare the traits of the left-brain,the reptilian brain and the astrological (energetic) influences of Saturn. Theyare expressions of each other in so many ways. Saturn is the planet (sun) ofrestriction, authority, control, obedience, poverty, fear and time. Saturn isthe astrological ruler of institutions, corporations, figures in authority andscientists. It represents laws, rules, regulations and ‘tradition’ (repeatingritual). Saturn is non-emotive and represents limitation, austerity anddiscipline. The left-brain is ‘logical and rational’, loves hierarchicalstructures of power and decodes information in the NOW into a sequence that wecall ‘time’. Left-brain dominated people control science, academia, medicine,politics, big business, religion, the media and the military. The reptilianbrain or R-complex is obsessed with ritualistic behaviour, the fear of notsurviving, hierarchical structures and conforming to traditional ways of doingthings across the whole spectrum of society – legal, religious and cultural.What is more, they all lack creative imagination.Excuse my FrenchI am all for education as in learning, but we don’t have that. The system ofwhat we call education has been structured from the start to program a student’sperception of reality for the rest of their life. The fact that it doesn’talways work is a testament to the power of Consciousness over programming, butwith the vast majority of students, work it does. A network ofRothschild-controlled organisations including the Frankfurt School of socialengineering set out to change the thinking, beliefs and perceptions of thepopulation through the programming system known as education. It is quite simpleonce you create a hierarchy and the institutions they administer because itpretty much runs itself from this point. Would-be teachers and college academicsfirst go through the system as children and young people and they are primed tosee the world in the desired fashion. They then move on to teacher trainingestablishments for further programming and to learn how to program the nextgeneration through exams to confirm that they, too, are programmed enough toprogram others in the ‘education’ perpetual-motion machine. They later go off toa school, college or university and teach their students within the confines ofsomething called a ‘curriculum’. This is set by government agencies so thateveryone is programmed the same way and woe betide any teacher who deviates fromits mendacious myopia if they have any ambitions to have a career in‘education’. Some of the most perception-programmed people I have ever met havebeen highly decorated university students and their revered academics. Richard‘Dogma’ Dawkins at Oxford University and Christopher French, professor ofpsychology at Goldsmiths College, University of London, come immediately tomind. I have met them both and while they are supposed to be intellectual‘giants’ I personally never found anyone home in either case. Both vehementlyattack any opposing view of reality or healing with the usual arrogance ofignorance. Dawkins is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was once,bizarrely in my view, the Oxford University Professor for Public Understandingof Science from 1995 until 2008. How can he help the public understand what hedoesn’t? French is a professional ‘sceptic’ of anything that deviates in any wayfrom the norm that the system has programmed him to worship and he is theEditor-in-Chief of The Skeptic magazine in the UK (the American spelling of theBritish sceptic). I can think of no one more suited, except perhaps for Dawkins.Both are classic prisoners of the left-brain, as are ‘sceptics’ in general.People say that it is good to be sceptical but it’s not. It is good, indeedessential, to question, research and filter information, yes, but that is notwhat sceptics do. They set out from the off to discredit anything that does notconform to their software. The idea is not to question and see if somethingstands up to scrutiny, but simply to destroy its credibility. They don’t care ifsomething has validity – their goal is to persuade people not to believe that ithas. Much of this stems from their own desperate need to constantly confirmtheir own belief system because far too much has been invested in that forsomething like the truth to be allowed to come along and demolish it. Frenchonce attacked what I say in my books on a television programme and when I askedhim if he had read any of my books he said ‘no’. Extraordinary. The lack ofresearch for an alleged academic was shocking and what contempt for the watchingaudience. But it was even worst when I asked him how on Earth he could thereforeclaim to know what I am saying. ‘I read it in the papers,’ came the reply.Dawkins and French are two wonderful examples of the academic guards on the gateto the left side of the brain mocking and blocking entry for the insights of theright – insights that would explain why what people like Dawkins and Frenchbelieve to be parapsychological psychobabble is far more logical than anythingthey have ever come up with or ever will in their current state of mind. Some ofFrench’s ‘explanations’ for the so- called ‘paranormal’ are ridiculous and itsays everything that he calls reality as it really is ‘paranormal’ whilereferring to his own nano-reality as ‘normal’. Academics and ‘scientists’ likeDawkins and French think they are so clever and yet the system has had them forbreakfast, dinner and tea and an important part of this is to make them thinkthey are clever when, in the greater scheme of understanding, they are in myview clueless. The Indian philosopher and writer Jiddu Krishnamurti put it sowell: ‘It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sicksociety.’ Dawkins and French are not alone, either. They are downloads of theblueprint, the software program downloaded into academics, scientists, doctorsand journalists the world over. The left-brain will never understand reality byitself, but the right-brain can because it connects dots and sees unity notfragmentation.Planned stupidityCharlotte Iserbyt was a Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of EducationalResearch and Improvement at the US Department of Education during the first termof President Ronald Reagan, and also worked for the State Department. Herobservations and experience in this period, and highly detailed research thatfollowed, led to her writing the book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America,which exposed exactly what the title suggests. You can also watch her video onYouTube called The Miseducation of America. She details a story that could betold about countries throughout the world because the Archon networks follow thesame global agenda. Iserbyt’s book is based on documents she took from the filesof the Department of Education in Washington where she worked. The documentsreveal a calculated plan to transform the education system into a means of massperception programming to create ignorant and compliant adults who would servegovernment and corporations like unquestioning robots and support the agenda forthe centralised control of humanity through a world government. ‘Education’ isactually the conditioning of perception of self and the world to remove allmoral, psychological and perceptual barriers to the desired social change andthe descent into full-blown slavery. The system is designed to instil thefollowing life-long perceptions:> • Truth comes from authority.> • Intelligence is the ability to remember and repeat.> • Accurate memory and repetition are rewarded.> • Non-compliance is punished.> • Conform intellectually and socially.Charlotte Iserbyt’s work at the National Institute of Education shocked her intoaction when she realised from reading official documents that grants and fundingwere being targeted to create a brainwashing operation under the name of‘Education’ and that the use of computers in schools was high on the list withthe eventual deletion of books. This is also related to the replacement of paperbooks with electronic books which so many people prefer today, but I wish theydidn’t. Iserbyt uncovered the plan to encode school computer software withbrainwashing and perception-manipulating techniques. She said:> So, I spent six weeks up there, going through all the stuff. I can’t tell you> how horrible . . . First of all, even if you don’t care about children, you> don’t care about education, you don’t care about your country, you don’t care> about anything (Are there people out there who don’t care about anything?) –> they do care about their wallet, huh?

Can you> imagine, designed by Washington... all the different education associations.> And within that big paper that I found – Better Education Skills Through> Technology, it was called, Project BEST – I found this one paper (this was> sort of a draft), it said: ‘What we at the federal level can control and> manipulate.’ That’s a direct quote!Children and young people the world over are being prepared to be nothing morethan a cog in a centrally orchestrated machine and we are seeing more and moregroup-based ‘education’ to teach children to concede individuality to groupthinkand to put even more pressure on those in the classroom that have no wish toconform. This is presented as their lack of conformity (‘supporting theconsensus’) holding back the group. The emphasis is upon ‘group learningstrategies’ and all children in a group must achieve the goals before the groupmay move on. One term for all of this is Outcome Based Education which meansensuring a single outcome for all – a programmed mind (Fig 514). This grouporientation makes Outcome Based Education a system for behaviour modification ofthe group, not education for the individual. It is a collective modification inwhich competition is discouraged and the individual learns that the group ismore important than them. Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was a British writer,social critic and aristocrat from the Archontic Russell bloodline. Hisgrandfather was Prime Minister John Russell and his official parents wereViscount and Viscountess Amberley, although you never know with royalty andaristocracy. Bertrand Russell wrote in his 1951 book, The Impact of Science onSociety:[../Images/00338.jpg]Figure 514: Little boxes, little boxes ....> Education should aim at destroying free will so that pupils thus schooled,> will be incapable throughout the rest of their lives of thinking or acting> otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished ... Influences of the> home are obstructive; and in order to condition students, verses set to music> and repeatedly intoned are very effective ...> ... It is for a future scientist to make these maxims precise and to discover> exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is> black. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been> in charge of education for more than one generation will be able to control> its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.There you have in two paragraphs what ‘education’ was created to achieve andwhat it is doing today in an ever more extreme form. Behavioural scientists andsocial engineers have been widely employed to bring this about andindividuality, choice and freedom are their sworn enemies. The most prominent intransforming American ‘education’ was the Rockefeller-funded Wilhelm MaximilianWundt (1832-1920), a professor at the University of Leipzig in RothschildGermany who became known as the one of the founding figures of modernpsychology. Wundt viewed human beings as nothing more than the sum total oftheir experiences and therefore able to be programmed like what we today call acomputer. This is the philosophy on which education was founded and not only inthe United States either. Erich Fromm (1900-1980) was another Rothschild Zionistinfluence on education policy and closely associated with the ‘philosophy’(programming) of the Rothschild Zionist Frankfurt School. His aim to wasmanipulate children and the rest of the population into seeing alleged ‘experts’in the various fields as the fountains of wisdom and knowledge and not to thinkcritically for themselves by doing their own ‘thinking and deciding’. EdwardBernays (Rothschild Zionist), the socalled ‘father of public relations’(propaganda and mendacity) told his clients to always hire ‘experts’ such asscientists to get their propaganda across because the public held them in suchhigh (programmed) regard. Acquiescence to perceived all-knowing ‘experts’ isprecisely in the line with the technocratic society that the Archons are seekingto impose with their agents in control. Insider Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote 40years ago about the coming ‘technetronic society’. He said:> The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled> society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by> traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous> surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files> containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files> will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.[../Images/00035.jpg]Figure 515: ‘Where is Australia?’ ‘Ugh, isn’t that in Mexico?’‘Education’ has been systematically manipulated to turn out young peopleconditioned to accept just such a society. Look also at the tidal wave of‘experts’ trotted out by the media worldwide every day to tell us what tobelieve and think. Complete tossers most of them as well. Humanity is paying forits own enslavement and that of their children by handing over outrageous chunksof their income to government who then spend it on employing social engineers toturn education into a conveyor belt for zombies (Fig 515). You cannot divide thedumbed-down education system from food additives, fluoride in drinking water,vaccines, pharmaceutical drugs, electromagnetic influences and the brain-deadmedia because they all come together in the war on human perception andcognition and the mutation of the human vehicle. In fact, drinking water is aprime conduit for this because food additives, vaccines, pharmaceutical drugs,genetically-modified organisms and so on are flushed down the toilet to turn upin rivers, streams and drinking water. Pollution of all kinds seeps through intoground water supplies and so drinking water. If people saw what a top classwater filter takes out of what comes through the tap they would be shockedrigid, and it is all adding to the dumbing down process. Stanford Universityresearcher and geneticist Dr Gerald Crabtree believes humans are losingcognitive capabilities and becoming more emotionally unstable. He said:> I would wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear> suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most> intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions, with a good memory, a> broad range of ideas, and a clear-sighted view of important issues ...> Furthermore, I would guess that he or she would be among the most emotionally> stable of our friends and colleagues.And the whole thing is coldly deliberate. Charlotte Iserbyt reveals how USgovernment documents detail a plan to gradually (Totalitarian Tiptoe) change theway that children and students are taught with the goal of deleting parentalinfluences so the State becomes the parents – see Aldous Huxley and Brave NewWorld. I knew from my own research in the 1990s that, as Charlotte Iserbyt saysin her book, the Rothschild-controlled Andrew Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Education and the Rockefeller General Education Board werepump-priming social engineers and other players in this conspiracy to hijack theminds of the world’s children. The Archon families established tax-exemptfoundations – the Rockefellers have many – to fund their agenda under the guiseof philanthropy and donating to the public good. This way they can do theirdastardly deeds without even paying tax. The tax-exempt foundation scam wasexposed in detail in the 1950s by the United States House Select Committee toInvestigate Tax-Exempt Foundations and Comparable Organizations. This is betterknown as the Reece Committee after its chairman, Carroll Reece. The committee’schief investigator Norman Dodd did a brilliant job exposing the agenda that thefoundations were serving. He produced minutes of the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace that showed that it was manipulating war to change the faceof American society. A telegram was even sent to puppet President Woodrow Wilsonurging him not to let the First World War end too quickly before it had changedAmerican society irreversibly (see ... And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Theseare the callous, heartless, soulless Archons that I am exposing and they didn’tcare about the mass carnage every day of that war would bring. But what happenedwhen Dodd revealed his findings with detailed supporting documentation? Nothing,of course. Those that control the foundations also control the politicians thatlet them do what they like. The Archon corporations have moved in on educationjust as they long have to governments and their agencies. Archontic abominationslike Monsanto – the biotech version of Goldman Sachs – give funding touniversities and put their executives on ‘education’ boards to ensure that theirversion of people-killing genetically-modified food, pesticides and herbicideswin academic approval and a thumbs up in the curriculum. Michael Gove, thedreadful Education Secretary in the Cameron Conservative (Tory) Government inBritain, wants to allow corporations to establish ‘for profit’ schoolsindependent of elected accountability. This is being promoted by a pressuregroup called ‘Bright Blue’ under the Orwellian name of ‘free’ schools to invertwhat is really being suggested. A book in support of the policy says:> It will be important, of course, to convince the public that this does not> stem from an ideological position: that somehow private is better than public> and Tories are pursuing privatisation in awe of money-making. This is not> true. This is a sensible, hard-headed policy which provides alternative> funding sources to boost diversity and ultimately quality of education in this> country, while – and this should be said time and time again – ensuring state> education remains free at the point of use.Yes, and I can knit fog. The Archon plan is for their corporations to take overeverything and it is clearly happening. Charlotte Iserbyt reveals how what Icall Problem-Reaction-Solution has been used to advance the Orwelliantransformation. One engineered education ‘crisis’ has followed another and eachtime the ‘solution’ has been to increase the scale of perception programming.Remember that the life-force of Problem-Reaction-Solution is problems or crisesand so they have to keep engineering them if they don’t occur naturally, whichmost of the time they don’t. This applies to the entire spectrum of humansociety. Those children that don’t easily conform to the programming are said tohave ‘learning difficulties’, ‘behaviour issues’ or ‘Attention Deficit Disorder’(ADHD) which I define as an instinctive awareness that what you are being toldis bullshit. I had this most of my school life although it wasn’t given a namethen and I provided my own ‘cure’ by daydreaming out of the window (Fig 516).Today they ‘deal’ with these manufactured and invented psychological andbehaviour ‘problems’ by handing out Ritalin, and other psyche-scrambling drugs,like confetti at a wedding. If they won’t conform to the program we’ll drug themand get them that way. You only have to look at some of the alleged symptoms ofADHD ... not listening when spoken to, being forgetful, not finishing homework,fidgeting, talking excessively. In a word: nonconformity. They inventedAttention Deficit Disorder to justify drugging whole generations but it has goneeven further now with Ritalin and associated drugs being prescribed for thoseunderperforming (in the system’s view) academically (Fig 517). I have beensaying and writing for years that ADHD is a manufactured and invented NoProblem-Reaction-Solution and even the American psychiatrist Leon Eisenberg(Rothschild Zionist), known as the ‘scientific father of ADHD’, eventuallyagreed. Eisenberg, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, was quoted by theGerman weekly Der Spiegel as saying seven months before his death in 2012: ‘ADHDis a prime example of a fictitious disease’. Yes, a fictitious disease that hasmade a staggering fortune for Big Pharma and destroyed the lives of wholegenerations of children. This is the same Eisenberg who was described byPsychiatric News as ‘a leader in child psychiatry for more than 40 years throughhis work in pharmacological trials, research, teaching, and social policy andfor his theories of autism and social medicine.’ He was just another liar,manipulator and crazy messing up the lives of children worldwide to advance theArchontic design. Despite Eisenberg’s close-to-deathbed confession, Americanschools are given financial incentives to ‘diagnose’ children with hisfictitious disease and since that scheme began the number of children officiallylabelled ADHD has gone through the roof. Patti Johnson from the Colorado StateBoard of Education told the US House of Representatives Subcommittee onOversight and Investigations:[../Images/00046.jpg]Figure 516: My days at school.[../Images/00277.jpg]Figure 517: No, but the ‘education system’ is.> The so-called learning disorders have, sadly, become a way for financially> strapped schools to make ends meet. In many states, schools have become> authorised Medicaid providers and funds can be collected in behalf of a child> labelled with one of the learning or behaviour disorders.> This can be such a lucrative cash cow that in a letter dated October 8, 1996,> the Illinois State Board of Education strongly encouraged the superintendent> of one of its districts to participate in Medicaid incentives. The letter> stated that Illinois had received $72,500,000 in federal Medicaid money in> 1996 and that Medicaid dollars have been used for a variety of nonmedical> purposes and that ‘the potential for the dollars is limitless’.Four million children are now on Ritalin in the United States alone and thefigures in countries like Britain would equally constitute mass child abuse withRitalin prescriptions increasing four-fold in a decade. Think of the profits forBig Pharma of drugging our kids. The military uses drugs just as liberally tosecure conformity from the troops and their programming is only a far moreextreme version of what is done to children. Soldiers have to be subjected tosome of the most potent and extreme perception programming on the planet becausethey have to be conditioned to follow orders without question even when it meanskilling civilians, including children, that they have never met and know nothingabout except for what the programmers have told them. Children, students and thepopulation as a whole are also subject to military perception programming – Godbless America, support the troops – to believe that it is fine and ‘doing yourduty’ for the military to follow orders without question. Talking of which,education is becoming a propaganda tool of the Pentagon and NATO by conditioningstudents to support their wars of conquest in the name of protecting people fromterrorism. If you put these words into a search engine you will hear an idiotteacher at work in this regard: ‘Moulding Young Minds: American SchoolsPreaching the Virtues of a War On Iran’. This stupid man was promoting Americanand Israeli military intervention in Iran during an alleged ‘discussion’ withstudents that included the rule that an opinion that nothing should be doneabout Iran was not allowed. When one bright student was challenging this andrightly pointing out that the United States was the only country to bomb anyonewith nuclear weapons she was told by the brain-donor teacher that this was‘irrelevant’. Almost immediately after the student made her point you hear thePrincipal’s office, which was monitoring the class, summon her on an intercom.This is straight off the books of Orwell’s 1984. Many teachers are no longereven writing individual reports on their students, but instead using a computerprogram that allows them to put in the student’s name and alleged ability rangeand the software offers a series of stock option phrases to compile the report.All individuality is being deleted from what passes for education. Building asystem like this is easy in the absence of challenge from the target population.All you have to do is employ psychopaths, sociopaths, control freaks and moronsto run your schools and institutions and away you go. There are no nationalstandards for the punishment and restraint of children in American schools andonly 17 states have any protection laws. Put the words ‘There are no words todescribe the outrage and it’s still happening’ into YouTube and you will seewhat this means for kids at school, often those with autism and otherdisabilities. A child is given what this criminal school calls ‘skin-shocktherapy’ which is Orwellian code for an electric shock that has the kidscreaming with pain. Yes, this is happening in American schools along withpupils being put into padded cells (exposed to be happening in the UK, too) andeven specially designed restraint duffle bags. Thousands of children have beeninjured and traumatised and dozens killed by these lunatics and yet what youwill see in the video is all perfectly legal. This is all systematicallypreparing children for the adult world of total control, brutality andsurveillance that the Archons are currently imposing so fast. Yes, and anyonethink that psychopaths, paedophiles and masochists wouldn’t be attracted to theteaching profession in these circumstances? There are still intelligent, kindand genuine teachers who the system hasn’t filtered out yet, but every day forthem must be a nightmare of frustration and incredulity.Gates at the gateA man who will be getting significant mentions in the later stages of the bookis Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates who heads the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation with his missus (Fig 518). The more I research about Gates the moreblatant it becomes that this guy is a serious player in what is going on. Eitherthat or he’s an idiot. You pay your money, in his case lots, and you take yourchoice. The reason I offer such a stark choice is that these can be the only twopossible explanations for why Gates uses his foundation to fund and promote somany pillars of the Archontic bloodline agenda – the climate change lie,geoengineering, vaccinating the entire world, population culling, death panelsfor old people, genetically-modified food (not least in Africa), on and on itgoes. This will become clear as we proceed into the Hunger Games chapters, buthe’s at it with ‘education’ also. There appears to be no aspect of life in whichthis genius in his own mind cannot decide what is best for everyone. One articleexposing Gates was headed: ‘Indoctrinate the World: Gates Foundation HijacksEducation Policy’. It went on to explain how the Gates Foundation had set out to‘transform public school classrooms into psychological laboratories completewith human test subjects’. Foundations and corporations are actually the samething in all but name and just as governments have a revolving door withcorporations like Monsanto through which the same people move between one andthe other, so Obama has recruited a number of people from the Gates Foundationand involved them in developing and imposing new policies for education. Well,they are both following the same game plan so I guess it makes sense. Gates alsoworks closely with other foundations like another education-manipulator, theRockefeller Foundation, which Gates said ‘inspired’ him to establish his own.Oh, please. We are looking at a global network of masks on the same face workingto the same end. They go under names like ‘government’, ‘corporation’,‘foundation’, ‘television channel’ and ‘newspaper’. They are all on the sameteam if you go high enough. The US General Education Board, founded by theRockefellers, said as long ago as 1902:[../Images/00289.jpg]Figure 518: What is the agenda of these people?> In our dreams ... people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding> hands. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into> philosophers or men of learning or men of science. We have not to raise up> from among them authors, educators, poets or men of letters. We shall not> search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians, nor lawyers, doctors,> preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have ample supply.Now the Gates Foundation has entered the fray to take this to its conclusion andMichael Petrilli, vice president of the Fordham Institute, has declared: ‘It isnot unfair to say that the Gates Foundation’s agenda has become the country’sagenda in education ...’ A California Teachers Association article highlightedthe influence of the Gates Foundation in ‘reforming’ the school system. The term‘reforming’ – copiously used by Archontic gofers like Tony Blair – is simplycode for changing society in the image of the Archon blueprint. The articledescribed how funding from the Gates Foundation and others came with stringsattached to demand in return for the money a more ‘top-down, authoritarian’structure and standardised testing (i.e. program every mind the same). The GatesFoundation has spent some $50 million on a project it calls Measures ofEffective Teachers. This is evaluating teachers to make sure they are doing whatthe system tells them. The all-knowing, expert-on-everything Melinda Gates toldthe PBS NewsHour: ‘What the Foundation feels our job is to do is to make sure wecreate a system where we can have an effective teacher in every single classroomacross the United States.’ Yes, a teacher effectively programming children withthe system’s perception blueprint.Big Brother SchoolsEducation programming is not only about what is thought and how it is taught.There is also conditioning the acceptance of an Orwellian society of totalsurveillance by making schools and colleges mirror what they want the world tobe like. We now have schools and colleges with cameras everywhere and irisscanning and fingerprint technology to pay for dinners or take out a librarybook. Microsoft, the company brought to worldwide significance through its frontman Bill Gates, is hiking around a system already used in some schools in whichpupils as young as four have to swipe a bar-code in and then press their thumbon a scanner just to take out a school library book. One school at which thiswas ‘trialled’ was Higher Lane Primary in Whitefield, Bury, Greater Manchester.Those who arranged for this clearly don’t realise that what they are doing is aform of deranged insanity and where are the parents when these things areintroduced? There is absolutely no need for any of this whatsoever, butnecessity plays no part. The whole idea is to program children to accept thisinvasive level of surveillance and privacy deletion to be ‘the way it is’ and,after a generation or two, perfectly natural. People tend to accept the world asit is when they are born. That becomes their reference for normal and any changeis a deviation from that norm. The norm of my generation born in the 1950s wasnot the outrageous scale of Orwellian surveillance and imposition that we seetoday and we have seen nothing yet if we sit on our hands any longer. This meansthat I can make the comparison between what was and what is and the speed ofchange in between. Children born today don’t have that experience, thatreference point. To them this is ‘how it is’. The idea of turning schools intofortresses in which children are kept under lock and key and watched whateverthey do and wherever they go is changing the reference point of normal for newgenerations. They are being conditioned to take it for granted and so notchallenge what is imposed upon them (Fig 519). The more you can stage massshootings at schools using your drugged up, mind-controlled stooges to take therap the more you will terrify parents and children into accepting Orwellianschools as an essential means of protection. I am seeing an ever gatheringnumber of stories, especially in the United States, of having police officerseither at schools or called to deal with incidents involving rebellious childrenand students that teachers of a previous era would not have dreamed of involvingthe police with. It has gone so far that Janet Napolitano, the RothschildZionist head of the Archon-controlled US Homeland Security, established a newHomeland Security Advisory Council involving 19 university and collegepresidents with the job of integrating education with the demands of ‘nationalsecurity’. This would take surveillance and spying on students to still newlevels of outrage and absurdity. Young people are being prepared to accept humanmicrochipping through fascist ‘trials’ (yes, of course they are) which forcestudents to wear microchipped IDs that allow their movements to be monitored allday. This began with the moronic management at the Northside Independent SchoolDistrict in San Antonio, Texas, and is planned to be expanded to 112 schools –yes, and the rest nationwide and eventually worldwide. The Student LocatorProject (how about a much more relevant Academic Brain Locator Project?) hasbeen justified by student safety and reducing truancy, but that is just ananything-will-do excuse. The real reason is to program familiarity andacceptance of human microchipping. What about the safety of student freedom andprivacy? The school district threatened to suspend, fine and expel students whorefused to comply and without the chip they cannot access common areas like thecafeteria or library or buy tickets for extracurricular activities. These peopleare light years beyond pathetic. This is the technique being used to bring inhuman microchipping. They won’t make it compulsory at first, just as otherschools are introducing non-mandatory ID chips, but then they stop people doingmore and more essential things, including banking, unless they have a chip.These Texas schools have gone the whole way and made it compulsory from thestart. Schemes like this are increasing all the time and include chips embeddedin the clothes of pre-school children. A student tracking programme in theAnaheim Union High School District in California includes an automated wake-upcall and students must enter a code five times a day to track their movementswhen they leave for school, arrive, at lunchtime, when they go home and at 8pmin the evening. Now just take a breath and let that sink in. You enter thisreality as Consciousness and within three or four years the system is tellingyou what you do, what you don’t do, where you can go and where you can’t, whatyou can say and what you can’t. I’ll tell you what schools are in one word –prisons. The only difference is that you are allowed to go home in the evenings,but now the school fascists are imposing more and more on that time especiallywith the outrage called ‘homework’. They are deleting as much play (right-brain)time as possible although the robot teachers and school heads are too ignorantof the world to see the context in which they work. Parents and students arebeing taken to court in this Brave New World of school fascism as was the casewith Ashley Derrick, again in Texas, who went before a judge for her sonMarcus’s occasional late attendance and non-attendance when the reason wasdoctor and psychologist appointments for his chronic asthma and, in his doctors’opinion, attention deficit disorder. AlterNet reported:[../Images/00198.jpg]Figure 519: Preparation to be a good little slave.> Dallas-area school districts are not uniquely harsh on suspected truants.> Around the country, school administrators, elected officials, and prosecutors> are tackling the truancy problem through the criminal justice system,> ratcheting up enforcement, slapping students and parents with big-dollar> fines, and threatening jail time.

How much more extreme does it have to getbefore the penny drops? Schools are prisons for the young. They even look likethem with their fences, padlocked gates, security doors, cameras, fingerprintingand prison warders, sorry ‘teachers’. Mississippi school children can even findthemselves in a police car for ‘violating dress code’. Unfortunately theteachers and managers do not suffer the same consequences for violating sanity.One five-year-old boy was taken home by police for not wearing black shorts. Hedidn’t have any and his mother had used a black marker to cover up the white andred, but a little bit could still be seen – black and red, that is, not thebrain activity of the teaching staff. A student was sent to a juvenile detentioncentre for wearing the wrong colour socks because it was considered a probationviolation after a previous fight. Five black students were arrested on felonyassault charges because a peanut hit a school bus driver when they were throwingthem at each other. It is clear from the figures that there is a big racial biasagainst black students in the way these idiots hand out their punishments.Racial discrimination in Mississippi? Who would have thought it? My two sonswent to a school near where I live and everything was relaxed, open andnon-intrusive. Today it has padlocks on the gate, a high fence right around theperimeter and an off-the-peg system-server for a head teacher. Never mind whatparents, children and even most of the staff think. What the Mein Fuhrer Statedemands is all that matters, and is it any wonder that a control-freak statewould seek to employ control-freak enforcers? Schools are even being used todevelop agents for Homeland Security because they are going to need so many inthe world they are planning. The Pentagon’s, yes the Pentagon’s NationalSecurity Education Program (NSEP) is funding schools to ‘provide a cadre ofhighly qualified candidates for employment in the national security community’.They are looking for potential psychopaths in other words. Another aspect ofbehaviour preparation for the Orwellian State is making children and youngpeople fearful of authority and disconnected from normal human behaviour likehugging to say hello or goodbye. The Archons don’t want human responses – theywant robotic, emotionless behaviour like their own. This has led to a series ofextraordinary reasons for pupils to be suspended. These include hugging; havinga ‘distracting haircut’ (individuality); singing a wellknown heard-everywheresong because of its ‘sexual content’; a nine-year old for saying to a friendthat his teacher was ‘cute’ (sexual harassment); and having bloodshot eyes. Thisis designed to make children and young people watch every word in fear ofbreaking some code, law and regulation or infringing the Rothschild ZionistFrankfurt School-created political correctness.Paying to be programmedWhat is really taking the piss, and what the Archon families must be inhysterics about, is to make the targets of your ‘education’ programming take onmortgage levels of debt to pay for it. According to an investigation by theLondon Independent on Sunday the cost of securing a degree (of programming) isnow £100,000 over the course of a working life when interest and other fees andexpenses are taking into account on top of the £30,000 to £40,000 to pay for theactual tuition. The average student debt is estimated to be £53,000 bygraduation with living costs added in. Many have no chance of ever paying itback and so they have it hanging over them their whole lives. National Union ofStudents president, Liam Burns, said: ‘It is shocking that politicians treat thepotential of a generation before they have even started their working careerwith such nonchalance.’ That’s the idea, Liam. It is all preparation for alifetime of servitude. It was only in 1998 that tuition fees were introduced bythe Archontic front-man Tony Blair with students required to pay up to £1,000 ayear for tuition. Then the Totalitarian Tiptoe went into overdrive – exactly asplanned – and by 2013 it was £9,000. Student debt in the United States wasapproaching a trillion dollars by 2013 after a nearly 300 percent increase since2004. The number of borrowers and the size of the loans also increased by 70percent; with students late with their repayments up by 17 percent. Americanstudents are becoming homeless and hungry to try to pay their way. DiegoSepulveda, a student at the University of California, was made homeless afterlosing his job at a Subway outlet and National Public Radio reported that he wasalternating between sleeping in the library, the student centre and friend’scouches while having the occasional shower in a school gym. Others live inwomen’s shelters or sleep rough. Francisco Reynoso, a gardener in Palmdale,California, had debt collectors arrive at his home after his student son haddied to tell him that he would now be responsible for paying back the tuitionfees. The banks are screwing students and their parents into the ground in trueheartless Archontic fashion. The number of students going to university inBritain dropped by 40 percent in the wake of the fees-hike, but that suits theArchontic agenda perfectly. The children of the rich and El-ite have no problemwith the fees and this is all part of the fork in the road that we are seeing inall areas of society in which the rich and super-rich live in one world and therest of the population exist in the other to be nothing more than slaves totheir perceived ‘betters’. This is not to say that it is good to go touniversity as it is currently structured, but the degrees are necessary in thisrigged system to qualify for jobs within the institutions of state, science,medicine, law etc. etc., and they don’t want the ‘lower classes’ to be in thosepositions. They want them to be the exclusive domain of the El-lite as they oncewere and mostly have been since, but now the plan is to purge them of anyone whoisn’t from the ‘right’ background to open the way to the technocratic society –a world of poverty and control for the masses with an El-lite living in extremeopulence protected by a ruthless, armed-to-the-teeth police state.The programming system that I have described and which is hilariously known as‘education’ is the perception factory that moulds, stamps and wraps the minds ofthose who will go on to become ‘scientists’, psychologists, academics, doctors,politicians, lawyers, judges, ‘journalists’, bankers and corporate CEOs. Theparents of most of those will have little problem writing a cheque for tuitionfees. The same basic mind with the same basic perceptions heads out into theworld and its chosen specialisation while locked away in the same left-brainprison cell courtesy of the system known as ‘education’. This is what I call theacademic mind. It is a little boy at kindergarten who imagines himself to be anintellectual colossus in the way that a kid playing a computer game imaginesthat he is driving the tank or bombing a city. The system treats them asintellectually superior and gives them names like doctor, consultant, professorand QC to underpin the illusion that they have ‘got it’. But in my definitionthe ‘intellect’ is only the left side of the brain and by itself that is acomplete dunce compared with Consciousness. I return to my theme. If somethingis founded on a flaw or distortion it will machine-gun flaws and distortions inall directions. This is precisely what is done by ‘scientists’, psychologists,academics, doctors, politicians, lawyers, judges, ‘journalists’, bankers andcorporate CEOs. Some will do so knowingly because they are well aware that theyare agents of the conspiracy, but most will promote and dispense their flawedand distorted perceptions while believing that their ‘good education’ has giventhem a genuine fix on how things are. At this point the unknowingly programmedbecomes the unknowingly programming. All that means is to tell others to believewhat they have been programmed to believe and we know this as ‘scientific’orthodoxy, medical orthodoxy, the structure and systems of state and absolutelyeverything prefixed by the word ‘mainstream’. This includes, of course, themainstream media which is peopled by those who have been mind-moulded andperceptionprogrammed by the education system and the university production lineto see the world and reality in the same way as those they are reporting. As thegreat American comedian and thinker, George Carlin, said: ‘It’s a big club – andyou ain’t in it’. But most of these people, including, perhaps especially,‘journalists’, are so programmed that they don’t even realise that there is abig club – let alone that they’re in it. ‘I’m just reporting the world as I seeit’, I hear them say. No, you are reporting the world as the system hasprogrammed you to see it since you dispensed with the high-chair and in manyways even before. Now, here’s a thought: the masses get their ‘information’ andperceptions of reality from ... yes, wait for it ... it’s coming ...‘scientists’, psychologists, doctors, academics, politicians, lawyers, judges,bankers, corporate CEOs and ‘journalists’. What did I say again? Bollocks begetsbollocks and that is why human society is drowning in testicality (I made itup).This cancer of the mind has pretty much infiltrated every country in the worldunder the banner of ‘all children must be educated’. Yes, but they don’t mean‘educated’ which is only Archon-speak (inversion) for being programmed to beuneducated and that is what this is really all about. ‘All children must beeducated’ is brought to you by the purveyors of ‘all children must bevaccinated’ and funnily enough both are funded and promoted by Bill Gates. Lifeis so full of coincidences, eh?"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00372.jpg]Archon ‘Science’If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradictswhat some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority andbase your reasoning on your own findings.Leonardo da VinciWhat we call ‘science’ is the prime source from which the global populationoverwhelmingly gleans its sense of reality, what is possible and impossible andthe nature of life and who we are.Science is defined as: ‘The systematic study of the nature and behaviour of thematerial and physical universe, based on observation, experiment, andmeasurement, and the formulation of laws to describe these facts in generalterms.’ Another definition is ‘any body of knowledge organised in a systematicmanner’. The term ‘systematic’ is defined as ‘comprising or resembling asystem’; the definition of a system is ‘a group of interacting, interrelated, orinterdependent elements forming a complex whole’ and ‘a group or combination ofinterrelated, interdependent, or interacting elements forming a collectiveentity’.’ I quote the dictionary here to be systematic in my study of what‘science’ really is – little more than a guard at the gate to true reality, andpurposely so. ‘The Matrix is a system, Neo,’ and ‘science’ operates as a systemin service to the bigger system of human control. To be a mainstream scientistwith funding from The System you have to be very proficient at absorbinginformation downloaded from the education curriculum and repeating it accuratelyon an exam paper. This allows you, if circumstances go your way, to decide onthe scientific specialisation you then wish to pursue. There is quite a choicefor those by now firmly ensconced in the left-brain prison cell:Acarology; Actinobiology; Actinology; Aerobiology; Aerology; Aetiology;Agrobiology; Agrology; Agrostology; Algology; Allergology; Andrology;Anesthesiology; Angiology; Anthropology; Apiology; Arachnology; Archaeology;Archaeozoology; Areology; Astacology; Astrobiology; Astrogeology; Audiology;Autecology; Bacteriology; Bioecology; Biology; Bromatology; Cardiology;Cariology; Cetology; Climatology; Coleopterology; Conchology; Coniology;Craniology; Criminology; Cryology; Cynology; Cytology; Cytomorphology;Cytopathology; Dendrochronology; Dendrology; Dermatology; Dermatopathology;Desmology; Diabetology; Dipterology; Ecohydrology; Ecology; Ecophysiology;Edaphology; Electrophysiology; Embryology; Endocrinology; Entomology;Enzymology; Epidemiology; Ethology; Exobiology; Exogeology; Felinology;Fetology; Formicology; Gastrology or Gastroenterology; Gemology; Geobiology;Geochronology; Geology; Geomorphology; Gerontology; Glaciology; Gynaecology;Hematology; Heliology; Helioseismology; Helminthology; Hepatology; Herbology;Herpetology; Heteroptology; Histology; Histopathology; Hydrogeology; Hydrology;Ichnology; Ichthyology; Immunology; Karyology; Kinesiology; Kymatology;Laryngology; Lepidopterology; Limnology; Lithology; Lymphology; Malacology;Mammalogy; Meteorology; Methodology; Metrology; Microbiology; Micrology;Mineralogy; Mycology; Myology; Myrmecology; Nanotechnology; Nanotribology;Nematology; Neonatology; Nephology; Nephrology; Neurology; Neuropathology;Neurophysiology; Nosology; Oceanology; Odonatology; Odontology; Oncology;Oology; Ophthalmology; Ornithology; Orology; Orthopterology; Osteology;Otolaryngology; Otology; Otorhinolaryngology; Paleoanthropology; Paleobiology;Paleobotany; Paleoclimatology; Paleoecology; Paleontology; Paleophytology;Paleozoology; Palynology; Parapsychology; Parasitology; Pathology; Petrology;Pharmacology; Phenology; Phlebology; Phonology; Phycology; Physiology;Phytology; Phytopathology; Phytosociology; Planetology; Planktology; Pomology;Posology; Primatology; Proctology; Psychobiology; Psychology; Psychopathology;Psychopharmacology; Psychophysiology; Pulmonology; Radiology; Reflexology;Rheology; Rheumatology; Rhinology; Sarcology; Scatology; Sedimentology;Seismology; Selenology; Serology; Sexology; Sitiology; Sociobiology; Sociology;Somatology; Somnology; Speleology; Stomatology; Symptomatology; Synecology;Technology; Thermology; Tocology; Topology; Toxicology; Traumatology; Tribology;Trichology; Typology; Urology; Vaccinology; Virology; Volcanology (orvulcanology); Xenobiology; Xylology; Zooarchaeology; Zoology; Zoopathology;Zoopsychology; Zymology.I’m sure there will be many more, too. These specialisations rarely if ever talkto each other and often compete ferociously for funding and the very structureof ‘science’ is systematically fragmented into ‘dots’ when you can only see apicture when the dots are connected. This structure has been established to makesure that they never are. The specialisations are known as scientific‘disciplines’ in the meaning of a ‘field of study’. I cannot emphasise enoughthat words matter fundamentally to Archontic suppression because of theirvibration and their role in subconsciously programming perceptions. In this casethe term ‘discipline’ has other meanings including ‘a systematic method toobtain obedience’ and ‘a state of order based on submission to rules andauthority’. If you put these definitions and earlier ones together you see thetruth about ‘all-knowing’ science. This is the sequence that makes mainstreamscience largely irrelevant to understanding the nature of reality.Firstly the scientists of each generation are delivered by the mind factory thatis mainstream education. They already have a perception of reality based on whatthey have been told is real since their first day at school and that ‘real’ isthe ‘scientific’ real of the very mainstream ‘science’ they are now entering.They have to pass more exams in their specialisation and conform to orthodoxy topass them and the funding only comes if they stick to the song sheet throughouttheir careers. Ask any real scientist who has challenged the orthodoxy aboutwhat then happens to their funding. The term scientific discipline is a perfectdescription in the sense of ‘a systematic method to obtain obedience’ and ‘astate of order based on submission to rules and authority’; it is the systematicprotection and defence of a flawed and ludicrous explanation of reality and thisis why it cannot come close to explaining the great ‘mysteries’ of life. We areback with the Archontic theme of inversion: mainstream science is not there touncover the secrets of life, but to make sure they are never uncovered. Touncover the secrets, as with this book, is to uncover the Archontic enslavementof humanity and so ‘science’ is the essential guard on the gate together withits bedfellows-in-uniform – academics, politicians and journalists. Academicsquote scientists as the arbiters of truth and so do schoolteachers, politiciansand journalists who together form an ‘everybody knows that’ for the populationin general. Well, I don’t know that. I think it’s all bullshit. Politicians talkabout changing laws (as with ‘global warming’) in line with the findings(beliefs, often bought and paid for) of ‘distinguished scientists’; but what Imostly see are very undistinguished software programs at best and on the take atworst, parroting the official story and asking if the cheque is in the post. Inthe same way I hear politicians say they are acting on the findings of a‘distinguished judge’ in some inquiry or other, but I see a bloke wearingsomething with a tail on his head telling the government what it was agreed thathe would tell them before the ‘inquiry’ even started. The judiciary are some ofthe most corrupt people on the planet and so are most ‘scientists’. They, too,are told what the outcome is going to be before the funds are wired. Does anyonethink that corporations like Monsanto and Big Biotech, Big Pharma or Big Energyand Radiation are going to hand over mega bucks to scientists to report thattheir products, wares and technologies are lethal health-destroying shit? Ofcourse not, and so there is a no-paper-trail unwritten agreement – a nod’s asgood as a wink – that scientists accepting the funding will come to the ‘right’conclusions which will then be reported in the media as ‘scientists say’ when itis really the corporations with a vested interest saying it via the corruptscientists they have put on the payroll. I have detailed countless stories inother books of this corruption that infests mainstream science and it is gettingworse not better. Big Biotech and Big Pharma alone have armies of ‘scientists’lying for them and manipulated into the relevant departments of government toturn the lies into legislation or on to television screens to be promoted as‘experts’ who turn lies into the public’s perception of the world they live in.The vast majority of scientists have nothing to do with exploring reality andthe big questions about human existence. Most spend their days earning thecorporate dollar developing new toxic and heath-destroying additives for foodand drink; finding ways of turning every last entrail and animal leftover in tosomething they claim to be ‘food’; inventing new diseases and conditions andthen developing drugs and vaccines allegedly to treat them; justifying theever-expanding use of drugs for spurious and ridiculous ‘psychological’ reasons,especially for children; and developing still more built-in-obsolescencetechnology like iPads and cell phones to part people from their money whileadding further to our irradiated world. Cheers chaps, good work.Scientific ‘facts’ = unscientific assumptionsMainstream science is not about the genuinely open-minded pursuit of knowledge(‘science’ comes from the Latin ‘scientia’, meaning knowledge). Independent realscientists struggling for funding do that and I am a scientist under thedefinition of ‘any body of knowledge organised in a systematic manner’. Anyonecan be who pursues knowledge for the sake of knowledge – science for the sake ofscience. You don’t have to go through years of brainwashing first. Mainstreamscience is there to systematically block the genuine pursuit of knowledge whilepresenting an image of the genuine pursuit of knowledge. Researcher andbiologist Rupert Sheldrake has to his great credit been tenaciously challengingunscientific orthodoxy for decades (orthodoxy = ‘conforming with established oraccepted standards, as in religion, behaviour, or attitudes’). Sheldrake listsin his book Science Set Free ten mainstream science dogmas which prevent it fromunderstanding reality:> 1. That nature is mechanical.> 2. That matter is unconscious.> 3. The laws of nature are fixed.> 4. The total amount of matter and energy are always the same.> 5. That nature is purposeless.> 6. Biological inheritance is material.> 7. That memories are stored as material traces.> 8. The mind is in the brain.> 9. Telepathy and other psychic phenomena are illusory.> 10. Mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works.If the foundation assumptions are wrong then everything perceived from thoseassumptions must by definition also be wrong. If you assume that ice is notcaused by cold then you will light a big fire in your igloo and the roof willcave in. In the same way if you wrongly assume that you know what the body isand how it works your ignorance will devastate health with vaccines andpharmaceutical drugs even without those in the shadows who do know how it worksand purposely set out to devastate health for reasons that I will be explaining.If you assume that creation started with the Big Bang then everything thatfollows from that must be Big Bollocks. And it is an assumption, not the provenfact that scientists and media would have you believe. The media repeatersreport the scientific norms as fact without question or investigation. I toldthe story in Remember Who You Are of how Big Bang Theory is a perfect case of anoriginal assumption becoming ‘scientific fact’ merely through repetition and theteaching of each generation of children and students that this is how everythingbegan (Fig 520). The theory claims that around 13.7 billion years ago theuniverse was compressed into the nucleus of an atom and they call this the‘singularity’. Before this, they say, there was no time or space and then camean explosion generating temperatures of trillions of degrees. Is it warm in hereor is it me? This ‘Big Bang’ created subatomic particles, energy, matter, spaceand time. No, the Matrix did that in terms of our currently experienced reality.Then, the official story goes, along came planets and stars and everything inall existence that we see thanks to something the size of the nucleus of an atomgoing pop. Amazing, eh. American researcher and writer Terence McKenna capturedthe nonsense of all this when he said of Big Bang Theory ‘give us a free miracleand we’ll explain the rest’:[../Images/00329.jpg]Figure 520: Big Bang bollocks.> Every model of the universe has a hard swallow.

This was a group ofquasars (the brightest known objects in the universe) which is so big it wouldtake four billion years to cross even travelling at the speed of light (that’sthe official perspective anyway). Quasars are also known as quasi-stellarobjects and give off immense amounts of energy in the form of radio waves andother sources. The relevance of this colossal quasar cluster – about a fifth ofthe observable universe – is that something this large could not have formedwithin the Big Bang theory. Dr Roger Clowes, lead author of the astronomerteam’s report, said the discovery ‘upsets the foundations of everything we do’.Yes, and were programmed by the education system and the ‘scientific’ norms tobelieve was real. With the greatest of ironies the Big Bang Theory was firstsuggested in 1927 as the ‘hypothesis of the primeval atom’ by Georges Lemaître(1894-1966), a priest at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. He waspartly educated by the Jesuit Order, one of the leading secret societies in theArchontic web. One of the main ‘confirmations’ that the universe is stillexpanding as a result of the mythical ‘Big Bang’ is the phenomenon known as‘redshift’ – the belief that celestial bodies appear to be red in the lightspectrum when they are moving away because of the effect of frequency waves. TheBig Bang date of 13.7 billion years ago derives from redshift calculations andyet Edwin Hubble, the man credited with discovering redshift, said: ‘It seemslikely that redshift may not be due to an expanding universe, and much of thespeculation on the structure of the universe may require re-examination.’ Theredshift assumption is now in as much trouble as its associated ‘Big Bang’. Sohere we have the very foundations of the mainstream ‘science’ version of theuniverse – the one taught in schools and universities and constantly repeated asfact by the media – based on two assumptions that are patently flawed andblatantly nonsense; and these are the same people with the breathtakinglybare-arsed cheek to call alternatives to this view ‘pseudo-science’, which isthe mantra of the Skeptics Society. This is the same stream of unscientificclaptrap that asked us to believe at one point that the world was flat and thatthe Milky Way was the universe and nothing else existed before Edwin Hubbleproved them wrong in the 1920s. The whole history of mainstream science is ofmaking assumption after assumption after assumption based on other flawedassumptions and then being proven wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong again. Theassumption from which all other assumptions come is that the world is solid.This is extraordinary given that the scientific ‘discipline’ of quantum physicshas proved that it isn’t, but by the time quantum physics really got underway inthe 20th century the mechanical view of everything was so entrenched that it wasnot going to let little things like the truth get in the way. The rest of‘science’ vaguely acknowledges the quantum revelations only when absolutelynecessary and otherwise careers on like a drunk in a juggernaut ‘cocking a deaf‘un’ as we say in Britain to any information that exposes its beliefs andassumptions as the ravings of a lunatic. On the centre stage of this mentalityare people like Professor Richard Dawkins, Christopher French and the SkepticsSociety who peddle their beliefs and condemn non-believers in exactly the sameway that you see with religion. Dawkins especially is vehemently anti-religionbut too self-deluded to realise that he is the high priest of his own religionof Scientism in which the God is no god and the official version of everythingare the holy texts. Even those genuinely seeking to understand reality get sobogged down in the detail (left-brain) that they disappear up their ownbacksides with complexity rather than seeing how simple (right-brain) it all isin the basic themes (Fig 521). I read an article headed ‘Gravitinos’ – Will TheyUnlock the Mystery of Dark Matter in the Universe? It described the work of AreRaklev, an associate professor in particle physics in the University of Oslo’sDepartment of Physics, and his efforts to identify and explain ‘dark matter’which mainstream science believes makes up most of the universe even though itis invisible (hence they call it ‘dark’). What you hear constantly fromscientists and journalists is the line ‘what we know is’. Journalists andtelevision news presenters will say ‘what we know is’ about a story when theydon’t know at all. What they say they know is normally only what the authoritieshave told them and nothing more. It is another assumption that they know andthis infests the media as much if not more as it does mainstream science. AreRaklev said in the article that ‘we can calculate how much dark matter there isin the universe’. No, mate, you think you can – you assume you can. He goes onto say ‘we still know little about what dark matter is’. Oh, but they havealready assumed that they can calculate how much of it there is?? What if darkmatter doesn’t exist at all? What if what you think is dark matter are reallywaveform and electromagnetic forces in the unseen impacting upon the seen? I amjust going to quote from the article – widely available on the Internet – toconfirm my point about complicating the simple and clambering through the analcavity:[../Images/00433.jpg]Figure 521: Mainstream ‘science’, academia and ‘journalism’.> In order to dig deeper into why Raklev believes dark matter consists of> gravitinos [don’t go there], and have any chance at all of understanding the> theory behind gravitinos [ditto] ...> ...

The Big Bang Theory is the prime example and inamong all that mind-numbing complexity you will see that Raklev’s gravitinostheory is wrapped up with the Big Bang Theory. Assumptions and theoriesdependent on other assumptions and theories delivered as fact – mainstreamscience in twelve words. This is what is taught as fact in the schools anduniversities and demanded to be repeated as fact in exam papers; this is what isrepeated as fact by the mainstream media and most of the alternative. Okay, hereis a theory of everything, my ‘ToE’, in terms of our experienced reality:Everything is the same energy/awareness in different manifestations – waveform,electrical/electromagnetic, digital and holographic – and all are expressions ofeach other. The universe and everything ‘within’ it is conscious and all theatoms, quarks, electrons and other particles are only by-products of the processin which waveform information is decoded into electrical, digital andholographic states. Reality is whatever we think it is because our beliefs andperceptions influence the decoding process to become our apparent experiencewhich means that the belief-system of scientists can dictate the outcome oftheir experiments – and does so all the time. But that is only the reality thatwe are currently aware of. The true theory of everything is far simpler:Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion. Put another way:Everything is a single unified and Infinite Awareness and ‘Creation’ is itsimagination. If humanity realised this – remembered this through the tidal waveof programming – the world would be very different and that is what mainstreamEstablishment science is there to prevent. The great majority within itscorridors and laboratories are so programmed themselves that they do notunderstand the agenda they are serving. They are caught in the hamster’s wheelof ‘progress’ going nowhere except on the surface and it has been centuries inthe making. The great American cosmologist Carl Sagan described the situationbrilliantly:> One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long> enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer> interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s> simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.> Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.Stitching-up scienceThe pillars of mainstream science and its beliefs and assumptions – and thepolicing of them to this day – have largely emerged through the Royal Societywhich has been dominated from the start by networks of Archontic secretsocieties like the Freemasons and the Rosicrucian Order. The Royal Society wasestablished in London by a royal warrant issued by Charles II in 1662 and becamethe world’s first assembly of scientists and engineers. Thus was born thedominating influence on the beliefs and direction of ‘science’ and thatinfluence came from initiates of secret societies that well knew that themechanistic dogma they imposed upon science was a con-trick. Their secretsocieties are founded on the very occult knowledge which mechanistic mainstreamscientist calls pseudo-science and dismisses with a wave of the hand. Archonticinversion at work once again. Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626), the High initiateand co-writer of the plays that were wrongly attributed to the illiterateWilliam Shakespeare, is said to have been the inspiration to form the RoyalSociety nearly 40 years after he died. Bacon was a leading Rosicrucian,translator of the Kings James version of the Bible and architect of Freemasonry(Fig 522). It was Bacon who wrote The New Atlantis symbolising a future Americarun by experts and what we would call technocrats even before any but those inthe inners circles knew that the American continent even existed. Leading lightsin the Royal Society have included Isaac Newton (1642-1726), a Rosicrucian GrandMaster who became a fellow in 1672, and he did more than anyone to promote themechanical nature of existence when he knew that this wasn’t the case. Othernotables were Elias Ashmole (1617-1692), one of the first registered Freemasons;Andrew Michael ‘Chevalier’ Ramsey (1686-1743), a leading light of Freemasonrywho was admitted to the Royal Society without scientific qualification; and JohnByrom (1692-1763), a Freemason and member of the Cabala Club, also known as theSun Club. More than 500 of Byrom’s papers were found in a house in Manchester in1984 which included texts describing sacred geometry and architecture,alchemical and esoteric symbols and information from the Jewish occult bible,the Kabbalah. They were working with one stream of knowledge while using theRoyal Society and their new Establishment version of science to keep thisknowledge from the population and it is has been happening ever since. EliasAshmole was an alchemist and Rosicrucian with many esoteric contacts in Germany.He was a close friend of Charles II and a Knight of the Order of the Garter; thepremier order of ‘chivalry’ headed by the monarch, which continues today.Ashmole was extremely well connected and maintained close contacts with the‘Invisible College’ that met in Oxford from 1650 (proposed by Francis Bacon inThe New Atlantis) which was the driving force behind the creation of the RoyalSociety. It included scientist Robert Boyle (1627-1691), another leading secretsociety initiate, and Sir Christopher Wren (1632-1723), the architect behind StPaul’s Cathedral in the City of London and, like Boyle, a Grand Master of theRosicrucian Order. The Royal Society, at its core, is a secret society thatlocks into the wider web and what it says or calls for is what the Archonticsystem tells it to say and call for. One of its tributaries was the LunarSociety, named from the fact that it met once a month on the night of the fullmoon in Birmingham, England, between 1765 and 1813. Its membership is highlysignificant and included American hero and Satanist Benjamin Franklin, the highlevel Freemason and Rosicrucian who was closely connected to the Freemasonsbehind the French Revolution, a friend of the British royal family andaristocracy and closely-associated with the Satanic Hellfire Club of his friendSir Francis Dashwood based in a cave system near what is now High Wycombe.Another Lunar Society member was Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of CharlesDarwin who the Archontic bloodlines used to further sell the belief in asoulless, mechanical and brutal universe with his assertions about the ‘survivalof the fittest’ in the mid-1800s. This became known as the theory of naturalselection in which the genetically most ‘advanced’ survive while the weakest dieout and it has been used to justify eugenics and race purity programmes likethose of the Rockefeller-funded Nazis. Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was just thesalesman for this manufactured belief-system which was described much earlier in1794 by his Lunar Society grandfather Erasmus in a book called Zoonomia. JosiahWedgwood of the Wedgwood pottery empire was another Lunar Society member and hisdaughter married Erasmus Darwin’s son, Robert Darwin. She gave birth to CharlesDarwin, and the same bloodline produced the infamously race-purity crazy, ThomasMalthus (Figs 523 and 524). It was Malthus who said that disease and terribleliving conditions for the masses were essential to stop overpopulation and thedilution of the bloodlines of the perceived El-lite:[../Images/00125.jpg]Figure 522: Sir Francis Bacon.[../Images/00413.jpg]Figure 523: Charles Darwin.[../Images/00273.jpg]Figure 524: Thomas Malthus> We are bound in justice and honour formally to disclaim the right of the poor> to support. To this end, I should propose a regulation to be made declaring> that no child born ... should ever be entitled to parish assistance ... The> [illegitimate] infant is, comparatively speaking, of little value to society,> as others will immediately supply its place ... All children beyond what would> be required to keep up the population to this (desired) level, must> necessarily perish, unless room be made for them by the deaths of grown> persons.That is the Archon mentality encapsulated – soulless, heartless, emotionless,callous and mechanical. These are the traits they are desperately trying totransfer to humanity in general, not least through the fundamentally-related‘science’ and ‘education’ systems. John Maynard Keynes, the economist whoimpacted so powerfully on modern economic policy, believed Malthus to be agenius and Charles Darwin and his crowd thought he was a ‘master of logic’. Sixof the members of the Lunar Society were educated in Edinburgh and so wasCharles Darwin. Edinburgh University is the centre for the preparation andrecruitment of bloodline operatives in Scotland just as Oxford and Cambridge arein England and worldwide. Edinburgh University is where the El-ite Masonicgrouping known as the Speculative Society is located, which has been connectedwith events surrounding the Dunblane school shooting tragedy. The Archonticpincer movement has been to entrap perception with religion (I am just little meand I have no purpose and I am subordinate to my genetic and intellectualbetters – scientists, academics, doctors and other ‘experts’ who tell me what tothink); and with the ‘rational’ belief that we are all a cosmic accident,nothing more than a computer-like machine (I am just little me and I have no useor purpose and I am subordinate to my genetic and intellectual betters –scientists, academics, doctors and other ‘experts’ who tell me what to think).The preferred option and the one they are pushing ever more obviously today isthe latter because this, even more than religion, disconnects perception from asense of any continuation of life after what is perceived as death. Once you buyinto this humanist philosophy that dominates the perceptions of science in theform of people like Professor ‘Dogma’ Dawkins you really are in the realms of Iam just a machine and there is no point to me. To take on such a narrow band ofreality is also to disconnect from the influence of levels of self that you donot believe exist.Such is the goal of ‘education’ and ‘science’ and they both come together togive us the biggest mass killer in the ‘Western World’ – modern ‘medicine’.Bollocks does indeed beget bollocks."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00063.jpg]Archon ‘Medicine’They dispute not in order to find or even to seek Truth, but for victory, and toappear the more learned and strenuous upholders of a contrary opinion. Suchpersons should be avoided by all who have not a good breastplate of patience.Giordano BrunoA foundation pillar of the Archontic conspiracy is a branch of ‘science’ knownas medicine. There are many reasons for this. You don’t want a sharp-thinking,vibrant, healthy and energetic population – that would be much too hard tomanipulate and control – and so you make them cumulatively none of these thingsby the use of pharmaceutical drugs dispensed by often little more than drugcompany representatives and high street chemists bravely described as ‘doctors’.Modern (Stone Age) medicine is also crucial to holding the line that preventsthe population becoming aware of its true self and the true reality. If doctorswere told what the body really is and how it works, and treated patients on thatbasis, the pharmaceutical cartel would be out of business and so wouldmainstream medicine. The cat and the bag would part company. Treating the bodyin the knowledge of what it really is would open the door to mass understandingof reality. I have spoken before about what I call defending the first domino.If you have dominoes lined up all over the floor you know if they are accuratelyaligned that when the first one falls it will progressively topple all the rest.The Archons know this in relation to the knowledge that is allowed to circulatewithin human society and so they defend the first domino at every turn. I hearpeople asking why governments and law enforcement respond in such an apparentlyover-the-top manner with certain people and situations. Invariably when you lookat what is happening they are defending a first domino. Healers treating peopleenergetically in accordance with the body’s true waveform/holographic natureface such attacks, condemnation and scrutiny from the system because they standat the gate – the first domino – to an understanding of reality. Doctors andmainstream medical ‘experts’ engage in these attacks because they have been soprogrammed by their education and medical school training that they have boughtthe lies hook, line and the other thing. In the spirit of Archontic inversionmost ‘experts’ in every field are really ignorant about the subject on whichthey are said to be expert. I haven’t been to a doctor for aeons because Iprefer to be healed than be made even sicker. It is no mystery, in the light ofall this, that the number one killer in the United States is the treatment. Addtogether all the doctor errors, drug-reaction fatalities, deadly infectionspicked up in hospitals etc., and you find that doctors and treatment bymainstream sources are the leading cause of death ahead of heart disease andcancer. An investigation by the respected online Consumer Reports said:> Infections, surgical mistakes, and other medical harm contributes to the> deaths of 180,000 hospital patients a year, according to projections based on> a 2010 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Another 1.4> million are seriously hurt by their hospital care. And those figures apply> only to Medicare patients. What happens to other people is less clear because> most hospital errors go unreported and hospitals report on only a fraction of> things that can go wrong ...> ... ‘There is an epidemic of health-care harm,’ says Rosemary Gibson, a> patient-safety advocate and author. More than 2.25 million Americans will> probably die from medical harm in this decade, she says. ‘That’s like wiping> out the entire populations of North Dakota, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It’s a> man-made disaster’...> ... ‘Hospitals haven’t given safety the attention it deserves,’ says Peter> Pronovost, M.D., senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns> Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. Nor has the government, he says. ‘Medical harm> is probably one of the three leading causes of death in the US, but the> government doesn’t adequately track it as it does deaths from automobiles,> plane crashes, and cancer. It’s appalling.’Governments don’t track it because they are controlled by the same Archonticforces that own Big Pharma. So, a deep breath here: Deaths caused by differentaspects of the treatment are right up there as a leading cause of death inAmerica and yet ‘most hospital errors go unreported and hospitals report on onlya fraction of things that can go wrong ...’ Shit, what must the real figure bethen? Death by doctor must on that basis be way ahead of anything elsecontributing to people departing this world. It will be the same in othercountries, too, because they are all dominated by ‘Western medicine’ which ismostly nothing more than an Archontic fast-track to the cemetery. But then itmust be this way because pharmaceutical medicine is treating a body that it doesnot understand (although those in the shadows do and they are doing this onpurpose). Studies have also revealed that adverse drug reactions that are notfatal are under-reported by as much as 85 to 94 percent and let nobody kidthemselves that very many deaths caused by drugs and incompetence are not givena fraudulent cause to cover up what happened. On one level the body is anelectrochemical organism and this can be devastated by pharmaceutical drugs. Itis almost comical in the United States to watch the endless television drugadvertisements conclude with some breathless person reeling off all the possibleside effects. This can take as long as the advertisement sometimes, even thoughthe voiceover is speaking so fast. Some Big Pharma companies have contemptuouslytaken to putting images on the screen during these breathless side-effectvoiceovers specially designed to divert attention from what is being said. Andthat’s another thing: ‘side-effects’. There is no such thing. They are not‘side-effects’ – they are effects every bit as much as the one they are using topromote the product. It would be far more accurate to say ‘these are the effectsof this drug – one of them we say is good and the rest are not good at all andcould easily kill you.’ This wouldn’t be beneficial for business, though, buthey, don’t worry, we have lots of other drugs to treat the effects of all therest (Fig 525). Testing and trial procedures are often pathetic and the USauthorities now allow drugs on the market with virtually no testing under a scamcalled ‘breakthrough therapy’ which is claimed to ‘expedite the development andreview of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions’ (like taking BigPharma drugs, presumably?). Another ruse is to bypass even doctors as much aspossible and allow ever-more powerful drugs to be sold directly over the counterin chemists and drugstores. You don’t need a doctor to kill you – now you can doit yourself, no prescription necessary. Not only that, but when the billionstaking these mind and body potions pee their residues away they end up in therivers and drinking water supplies. We have fish going through genetic mutations– so what is the cumulative effect on humans given how long this has beenhappening now? Pharmaceutical medicine is another term for human carnage. Adetailed and profusely-sourced report sponsored by the non-profit NutritionInstitute of America revealed that some 700,000 Americans die every year fromBig Pharma and Establishment medicine:[../Images/00286.jpg]Figure 525: Big Pharma ‘medicine’.> Each year approximately 2.2 million US hospital patients experience adverse> drug reactions (ADRs) to prescribed medications.

By> comparison, approximately 699,697 Americans died of heart disease in 2001,> while 553,251 died of cancer.[../Images/00354.jpg]Figure 526:The idiocy with which antibiotics have been handed out like candy has createdsuperbugs that are antibiotic-resistant. The British Government’s Chief MedicalOfficer described this as ‘a catastrophic threat’ to the population and globalpill-popping is now happening on a gargantuan scale. By 2011 Americans weretaking on average twelve medications a year and this continues to grow withspending on prescription medications increasing by $200 billion in 20 years (Fig526). Here are some figures from the US Centers for Disease Control:Physician office visits:> • Number of drugs ordered or provided: 2.6 billion.> • Percent of visits involving drug therapy: 74.4%Hospital outpatient department visits:> • Number of drugs ordered or provided: 255 million> • Percent of visits involving drug therapy: 75.5%Hospital emergency department visits:> • Number of drugs ordered or provided: 267.7 million> • Percent of visits involving drug therapy: 78%This doesn’t include the mountain of drugs bought over-the-counter either, andthese figures quoted by the CDC are not the latest which will be higher (Fig527). Now, get this. A research team working with the British Medical Journalconcluded that 90 percent of drugs and treatments don’t work. They investigated2,500 of the most common drugs and treatments and found that only twelve percentof those regularly prescribed by doctors have been shown in proper scientificstudies to have any benefit for treating illness – and those figures will be fartoo high because of the way Big Pharma fixes the data. We are looking atundiluted madness. The latest Big Pharma scam is drugs as ‘preventativemedicine’. No, it’s good. Instead of having a healthy lifestyle you just takedrugs all your life for things that you don’t have to stop you getting them. Itis being suggested that those who don’t have Alzheimer’s should take Alzheimerdrugs to stop them getting it. But isn’t suggesting this nonsense a clear signof dementia? They are taking the drugs, right? Then there is the statins‘prevention’ conspiracy. You tell people that cholesterol causes heart disease(nothing like as simple as that and cholesterol is crucial to health for itsrole in turning sunlight into vitamin D). Then you give them statin drugs to‘bring down cholesterol’. But in doing so it can set off a series of knock-oneffects that can lead to heart damage. But, no worries. At least you had yourheart attack after adding to Big Pharma profits while a heart attack without thedrugs would have paid them nothing. Profitable heart attacks are good; it’s theunprofitable ones that are the problem. Someone has just dropped dead without usmaking a profit – call a meeting. A paper published in the American Journal ofCardiovascular Drugs quotes almost 900 studies on the adverse effects of statinsincluding muscle pain; increased blood sugar (leading to diabetes); cognitiveloss; neuropathy; anaemia; acidosis; fevers; cataracts; sexual dysfunction;increased cancer risk; suppression of the immune system (as always);degeneration of muscle tissue; pancreas dysfunction and liver dysfunction. Oh,I’ll get some then, is the chemist still open? Despite this background we had anidiot in Britain, one Professor Sir Rory Collins, saying that everyone over 50should be taking take statins regardless of their health history. But have nofear. He must be right because he’s an ‘expert’. Eight million people in the UKare now taking statins and one in four Americans over the age of 45. Dear god.It was revealed in 2013 that Britain’s National Health Service (inversion) waspaying millions in severance payments to staff that included gagging agreementsto prevent them exposing the incompetence and corruption of the ‘health’ system.Over one three-year-period this equated to the salaries of nearly 750 nurses.The figures were revealed in the aftermath of the inquiry into the 1,200preventable deaths at England’s Mid-Staffordshire Hospital due to outrageousincompetence and lack of care. A Freedom of Information request to the UK Officefor National Statistics revealed that more than a thousand hospital patients hadstarved to death in four years and for every person who died this way anotherfour had ‘dehydration’ on their death certificates. The number of patientsleaving hospital suffering from malnutrition had doubled to 5,558. Talk aboutinversion. Most people believe that going to the doctor or the hospital is theway to regain health when you can be, and often are, putting yourself in seriousdanger. America with its colossal ‘state of the art’ ‘healthcare’ industry isone of the worst of all and a report by Save the Children in 2013 revealed thatmore babies die on their first day in the United States than in 68 othercountries. The report said:[../Images/00051.jpg]Figure 527: Have you taken your pills today?> The United States has the highest first-day death rate in the industrialized> world. An estimated 11,300 newborn babies die each year in the United States> on the day they are born. This is 50 percent more first-day deaths than all> other industrialized countries combined.> It is worth reading that last sentence again to take in its full enormity.The structure of sicknessBig Pharma ‘medicine’, or ‘allopathic medicine’, is 100 percent a creation ofthe Archon bloodlines with the Rothschilds and Rockefellers once again to thefore. The American Medical Association (AMA) was launched in 1847 some 15 yearsafter the British Medical Association (BMA) and others have followed throughoutthe world to hijack the treatment of sickness and disease. They are part of aglobal fascist pharmaceutical Mafia that includes theRothschild-Rockefeller-created World Health Organization (WHO) that now dictateshealth policy to governments almost everywhere. But it is nothing more than agangster’s moll – like the Rothschild-Rockefeller-created World TradeOrganization (WTO) – to focus control of entire areas of global policy likehealth and trade under one unelected, unaccountable roof. This allows theRothschilds and Rockefellers, who own the ‘roof’, to dictate the policies onevery continent just as they do through the Archontic banking cartel. The WorldHealth Organization serves the interests of the Big Pharma cartel which owns theWHO and the same with corporations and banks with regard to the World TradeOrganization. Governments do whatever these Rothschild-Rockefeller frontoperations tell them to do. I think they call it ‘democracy’ which is defined as‘the common people considered as the primary source of political power’. Excuseme a moment I am laughing so much I have to catch my breath. The AmericanMedical Association (AMA) was given the task by its creators of controlling themedical schools and removing all influence of ‘alternative’ methods of healingwhich were in use long before the Rothschild-Rockefeller hijack of human healthcare. The AMA was funded by the Rockefeller family and Carnegie Foundation whileJohn D Rockefeller founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in1901, the country’s first institute for medical research, to promote Big Pharmamedicine and it continues to do so today as the Rockefeller University. The waragainst alternatives to Big Pharma was led by Rothschild Zionist Abraham Flexnerwho was sent out to medical schools to report on their ‘suitability’ to teach onthe basis of whether they taught alternative therapies. Flexner’s RothschildZionist brother Simon Flexner led ‘research’ for the Rockefeller Institute from1903 to the 1930s into the cause and prevention of disease. Abraham Flexnerdelivered his manipulated ‘findings’ in 1910 in The Flexner Report whichdemanded that American medical schools should only teach and research theprotocols of mainstream science. The Rockefeller funded and orchestrated reportalso called for higher admission and graduation standards to sift outalternative thinkers. The Rockefeller-controlled American Medical Associationeven had a Propaganda Department, later known as the Investigations Department,to target, discredit and destroy alternative practitioners. One of itsspecialities, as it still is today, was arranging for anti-alterative articlesand studies produced by ‘safe’ people to be published in major journals andreported by the national media. The media is always compliant because (a)‘journalists’ have been through the same ‘education’ programming system andbought the pharmaceutical lie; (b) the mainstream media is owned by the samenetworks that own Big Pharma; and (c) a massive chunk of the media’s advertisingrevenue comes from Big Pharma. This, ladies and gentlemen, is where your ‘modernmedicine’ came from while John D Rockefeller, the oil tycoon and head of thefamily behind all this, was treated by his personal homeopath to the day he diedat the age of 97 – a fantastic age at the time.The other foundation of the health hijack was to introduce a system of licencingand this is used right across society today for almost everything. It goes likethis: you introduce licencing for something and pass laws (through yourbought-and-paid-for politicians) to say that you cannot do or practice so-and-sowithout a licence; and to get a licence you have to do it the way the licencingauthority dictates (ultimately the Archon bloodlines). In this case, if you wantto be a doctor you must be licenced and to be licenced you must only prescribethe scalpel and the drug. Anything else that is not officially approved and youwill be struck off even if it works, no, make that especially if it works,because that would endanger the Big Pharma monopoly. They are using the sametechnique of licencing and all-powerful governing bodies to control alternativemedicine today and dictate how it is practiced. What people have to appreciateif they are going to understand what Big Pharma medicine is all about is that itwas created from the start and is run to this day by Archon bloodlines to serveArchon interests – the very Archons that have a deep hatred of humanity, want amassive cull of the population and seek to enslave us like pigs in a pen. Thatis the goal of Big Pharma medicine – not healing and wellness. Why would thisArchontic system want to heal and benefit in any way its target humanpopulation? The system is designed to generate multiple billions every year forthe pharmaceutical industry and on that level alone would people of thismentality want to reduce business by making people well when they make theirdaily fortunes from people being sick? The opposite is the case and so drugshave effects that they say require other drugs which have effects that requireother drugs and the till just keeps on ticking as they develop new drugs andthen invent the diseases and psychological conditions to justify their use (Fig528). But money is still a by-product more than the main thrust of the gamewhich is to drug body and mind, zombify the population and make a primecontribution to the mass human cull which I will explain later. Licensing,propaganda and manipulation saw a 50-percent reduction in medical schoolgraduates by 1919 and the number of medical schools sharply declined. TheRockefeller fortune funded the schools that played ball, but not of course thehomeopathic schools they wanted to destroy. Even the Hahnemann School inPhiladelphia, named after the creator of homeopathy, Christian Friedrich SamuelHahnemann, switched to teaching Big Pharma ‘medicine’. Today the system iscompletely controlled by the Rothschild-Rockefeller networks and other Archonticsources through this recurring sequence: Would-be doctors must first go throughthe Archontic ‘education’ brainwashing to be thoroughly programmed with thesystem’s version of reality and to confirm the extent of their programming bydoing well in their exams; they then go on to Big Pharma-controlled medicalschools where programming about the nature of the body is downloaded andintensified along with the belief that the only way to treat illness is thescalpel, the drug and the cemetery; they then go into doctors’ surgeries andhospitals to ‘treat’ bodies they don’t understand with drugs they are told toprescribe; if anyone rebels against this medical straightjacket the door is thenext thing they see (the same with teachers, academics, mainstream scientists,lawyers and most journalists etc.). Doctors answer to their Archonticcontrolledprofessional bodies like the medical associations and medicine as a whole ispoliced in each country on behalf of Big Pharma by Big Pharma-controlled ‘publicprotection’ (Big Pharma protection) organisations like the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in theUnited States. These agencies and governments in turn answer to theRothschild-Rockefeller World Health Organization. This structure has beencreated entirely to serve the Archon agenda and 95 percent of those involvedwill have no idea that this is so or know an Archon from a colon. Mind, I canunderstand that because they are both full of shit.[../Images/00407.jpg]Figure 528: Big Pharma wants a healthy society?Doctors on the takeI have exposed the corruption of Big Pharma and the medical industry at lengthin other books (see the Doctors Destroy Health section in Human Race Get Off YouKnees, for just one example). I have catalogued how shocking numbers of allegeddoctors are on the take from Big Pharma through ‘gifts’ and free holidays atexotic places under the cover of ‘conferences’ they don’t even have to attend.There are also pay-offs for services rendered disguised as ‘research grants’ forwhich no research is ever done or expected to be done. I have detailed howsystematic and computerised the corruption has become with doctor-prescribingrecords studied by the drug companies to see which are big prescribers of drugs(an easy touch to get them to prescribe more) and those who prescribe less (adrug company representative is despatched to see what can be done). I have nevermet a former executive or employee of a Big Pharma drug company (they are allone company if you go high enough) that didn’t tell me that the cartel’s first,second and last priority was increasing the bottom line no matter what theeffect on human health. The Big Pharma cartel, Big Biotech cartel and Big Foodcartel are equally Archontically evil and corrupt because they are expressionsof the same force working to the same end. Big Food and Big Biotech make peopleill with their poisonous products along with poison-infested drinking water, andBig Pharma then provides the ‘treatment’ which makes the patient even worse inthe long run and often in the short. The whole system is founded on corruptionwhich is embedded in the very fabric of medicine. We have Big Pharma agentsappointed to government agencies that are supposed to be policing them anddoctors and officials in the pay of Big Pharma sitting on government committeesand agencies deciding what vaccines and drugs will be allowed on the market(every one that isn’t blatantly lethal and often those, too). Big Pharma alsohas around 1,300 lobbyists in Washington DC – more than two for every member ofCongress. ‘They are powerful,’ said Senator Chuck Grassley, a chairman of theSenate Finance Committee. ‘You can hardly swing a cat by the tail in that townwithout hitting a pharmaceutical lobbyist.’ Is it any surprise then thatlegislation favourable to the drug industry, including immunity fromprosecution, is constantly passed by the poodles on the Hill? It is the sameelsewhere, too, in this global gluttony of bribery and corruption. In Britain,for example, doctors are awarded bonuses for meeting government ‘vaccinationtargets’. These are financial incentives to increase the uptake of the toxicvaccine potions purchased by the government from Big Pharma. The Indiana-baseddrug giant Eli Lilly alone paid out $200 million to doctors and others in the‘healthcare’ industry to promote their drugs, according to official disclosure.Doctors being paid at all to promote the drugs of Big Pharma is a globalscandal, but the scale of the payments is way beyond scandalous and way into therealms of the corrupt and criminal. Does anyone think the interest of the drugcomes first for these ‘doctors’ or the interests of the patient? Eli Lilly wasforced to disclose the figures because of a court case in which it agreed tosettle criminal and civil actions for promoting drugs for uses that were notapproved and concealing the serious health risks of its schizophrenia drugZyprexa. They settled for $1.4 billion. GlaxoSmithKline agreed to a record $3billion settlement in 2012 after admitting the biggest health fraud case inAmerican history relating to bribing doctors, the illegal promotion ofprescription drugs, failing to report safety data and promoting medicines foruses for which they were not licensed. This behaviour is not rare, nor confinedto Eli Lilly and GlaxoSmithKline. It is the way the whole cartel works and thecases are legion where Big Pharma corporations have put drugs on the marketwhich they knew were highly dangerous or kept them on the market when they wereknown to be killing people. As an Internet article pointed out:> Big Pharma spends nearly $19 billion a year bribing and influencing> physicians, by the way. That’s billion with a ‘B’. How much money is $19> billion? It’s more money than NASA wastes smashing satellites into Mars and> exploding space shuttles in Earth’s upper atmosphere. It’s more money than the> entire junk food industry spends hypnotizing obese children into nagging their> parents for another box of sugar-bomb breakfast cereal at the quickie mart.> Heck, it’s more money than the entire United States spends on genuine disease> prevention and health education.You’ll find many examples of Big Pharma/doctor corruption in my other books.The Cancer cullThe number of cancer deaths let alone cancer sufferers worldwide is staggeringand they are increasing all the time as the toxic content of food, drink andenvironment (including the fantastic leap in atmospheric radiation) combine todevastate the balance and harmony of mind and body. Something like eight millionpeople die every year from cancer with more than half a million of those in theUnited States. The global number is predicted to rise to twelve million by 2030but given what the Archon networks have in mind that will be a seriousunderestimate if things are allowed to continue in the current direction. Canceris the biggest cause of death for people under 85, and in the US one in fourpeople die from the disease. A report by Macmillan Cancer Support predicted thatby 2020 almost half the UK population will have cancer in their lifetimes.Cancer is a parasitic monster that feeds on the body host and as such it is aform of Archontic possession. Big Pharma well knows what the cure is, but thereis no way they are going to make that available when the idea is to kill peopleand not cure them. I have revealed in other books how Dr Richard Day (RothschildZionist), professor of paediatrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and headof the Rockefeller-controlled eugenics organisation, Planned Parenthood, told aclosed meeting of paediatricians in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1969:> We can cure almost every cancer right now. Information is on file in the> Rockefeller Institute [now the Rockefeller University], if it’s ever decided> that it should be released.Day also said that the plan was to control and cull the population throughmedicine, food, new laboratory-made diseases and the suppression of a cure forcancer. He said that letting people die of cancer would slow down populationgrowth: ‘You may as well die of cancer as something else.’ This is the cold,callous, heartless Archontic ‘mind’ that created and controls the medicalindustry worldwide and runs the global Control System in all its facets andforms. This mentality is going to create a medical system for the benefit ofhumans? The very opposite applies and this is why alternative treatments forcancer, some of which I know can be highly effective, sometimes even at a latestage, are hunted down by Big Pharma, its agencies in government andorganisations like the national medical associations. They are all on the BigPharma payroll and so they dance to its tune. In doing so, they have beenresponsible for the death and suffering of billions across the world.Alternative cancer practitioners are targeted because Big Pharma is not going tosuppress the cure and then let someone else come along to break the monopoly andspill the beans. Many courageous people who have had incredible success withcancer treatment over the decades have ended up dead or in jail after beingbranded a ‘charlatan’ or ‘witchdoctor’. What better definition of fascism ortyranny could there be than people being prevented by law from deciding howtheir own body will be treated and by whom? The demonisation of alternativetreatments is supported by the essential compliance of the corrupt and idiotmedia which ridicules and condemns these treatments while many of the writers goon to die of cancer because there isn’t a cure. Idiot media? Far too mild. Thecompulsory cancer treatments that doctors must administer are chemotherapy andradiation – both of which devastate the immune system and ensure that the bodyis wide open to further cancer and other disease. So much so that in Britain afive-year survival for cancer patients, sometimes less, is officially recordedas a cure. Chemotherapy is a deadly poison that kills cells. Er, that’s it,nothing more. This is a form of Russian roulette based on the theory thatchemotherapy will kill the cancer cells before it has killed enough healthycells to kill the body. This is a point worth carefully noting. Look at all thetrillions that have poured into Big Pharma health ‘research’ this last more than100 years and yet still all they can do in response to cancer is to poisonpeople. How can this be? They have no intention of finding a cure when theyalready have one which has been kept under wraps while millions have died everyyear when they didn’t need to. All those people rattling their tins andorganising ‘charity’ events for cancer research are just feeding the monsterthat is systematically suppressing the cure that it already has and the natureof the disease itself. Cancer is actually a form of fungus and while the medicalracket denies this (because their ‘treatments’ would be toast) they stillprescribe the liver-damaging Tamoxifen for breast cancer which is an anti-fungaldrug. I spent many hours with a CIA scientist in the 1990s who told me how hehad been swiftly cured of cancer through a ‘serum’ he was given because his workwas important to them and they wanted him to live. Here is another reason whythe Archon bloodline big names live for so long. Is it not infinitely morelikely even by statistical chance that with all the trillions handed over forresearch and the decade after decade that this research has been going on thatthey have found a cure and suppressed it rather than failed to find one? Theywant people to suffer and die and the longer they suffer the better because theArchons feed of the energy of suffering and death. Then in 2012 and early 2013research revealed that far from curing cancer chemotherapy made it grow faster.Research published in the journal Nature Medicine did not set out to expose thisoutrage but stumbled on it by chance while seeking to understand why prostatecancer cells are so difficult to treat. The team at the Fred Hutchinson CancerResearch Center in Seattle, Washington, found that chemotherapy triggered thebody to release a protein called WNT16B which boosts the survival and growth ofcancer cells. The study found that chemotherapy causes ongoing damage to the DNAin healthy cells which is why the health of cancer patients is never the sameagain for the rest of their lives because the damaging effect includes the cellsof the immune system – the major target of Archontic medicine, food andbiotechnology. Once the immune system is weakened the body is open to attacksfrom all and sundry that it would otherwise deal with. Study co-author PeterNelson said: ‘WNT16B, when secreted, would interact with nearby tumour cells andcause them to grow, invade, and importantly, resist subsequent therapy ... Ourresults indicate that damage responses in benign cells ... may directlycontribute to enhanced tumour growth kinetics.’ Dr Raghu Kalluri, head of theMatrix Biology Division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, was aco-author of a study published in 2012 in the journal Cancer Cell which foundthat cancer drugs have the same effect. He said: ‘Whatever manipulations we’redoing to tumours can inadvertently do something to increase the tumour numbersto become more metastatic, which is what kills patients at the end of the day.’Okay, a very deep breath and a look at the cold facts: Not only are cures forcancer suppressed and kept under lock and key; not only areindependently-discovered treatments targeted and their practitioners harassedand even jailed by government agencies serving Big Pharma; not only dochemotherapy and drugs not cure cancer ... they can help it grow faster!! But ifyou are seeking to advance the Archontic agenda for humankind isn’t all thisexactly what you want? Big Pharma ‘medicine’: cut ‘em; drug ‘em; poison ‘em;irradiate ‘em. There, feeling better?If chemo doesn’t kill them – try radiationThe other mainstream ‘treatment’ for cancer is radiation and what is a majorcause of cancer? Radiation. In this way mammograms give more women breast cancerthan they ever identify. Why wouldn’t they when you are irradiating such asensitive part of the body? A long list of published studies have highlightedthe dangers of mammograms and the way they can cause cancer and even theiraccuracy in detecting cancer makes them irrelevant with up to 70 percent of‘cancers’ they detect turning out not to be cancers at all. This has made morewomen very dubious about being dosed with radiation for no good reason and whatis the response of the ‘health’ companies? Are they recommending that womendon’t have mammograms? Oh no, this is Big Pharma we are talking about. They areoffering women $25 gift cards if they have them! Published research hassuggested that perhaps as many as 25,000 people in America develop cancer everyyear from medical radiation exposure from the gathering technology. Once theonly source was X-rays but now we have computed tomography (CT), positronemission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dosing peoplewith cumulatively-deadly and DNA-damaging radiation and there is no questionthat the technology is endlessly used when not necessary just to add it to thepatient’s bill to make a profit on the machines. CT scans for adults andchildren have soared and Dr Jahan Fahimi, an emergency physician at theUniversity of California, San Francisco, told Reuters Health how figuresrevealed that ‘... for every six or seven kids that go to the ER for bellyache,one is going to get a CT scan’. This is often done for money with scans costinghundreds of dollars a time and performed more frequently on insured patients.No, surely not. Dr Fahimi said: ‘I tell my patients that the CT scan I do todayhas a chance of causing cancer at some point down the road. That risk may be onein 500, it may be one in 1,000, but it’s not zero.’ Returning to breast cancerand its treatment ... researchers at Duke University in North Carolina scannedthe records of 112,154 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1994 and 2004and found that those who chose not to have a mastectomy had a better chance ofsurvival. Research in Britain revealed that thousands of women are being givenaggressive and extreme cancer treatments when they are not justified by thecondition and we now have women having their breasts and other body partsremoved when there is nothing wrong with them because doctors have told themthey have a ‘cancer gene’ that is likely to give them cancer. In fact, this‘cancer gene’ and this or that gene propaganda is not true. The healing geniusthat is my friend Mike Lambert at the Shen Clinic on the Isle of Wight pointsout that a large number of genes need to work in unison to cause cancer. Two ofthe ‘cancer gene’ mutilators are actress Angelina Jolie, who had a doublemastectomy, and 24-year-old Miss America contestant Allyn Rose who announced inearly 2013 that she planned to have both breasts removed because her mother diedof breast cancer. She said that her father had persuaded her to have theoperation presumably after he had his own brain removed. Rose said that when herfather suggested the mastectomy at the age of only 18 she had told him: ‘Dad I’mnot going to do that. I like the body I have.’ She said he then got serious andsaid: ‘Well then you’re going to end up dead like your mom.’ How did he knowthat? Doctors told him. What a pillock. Even worse, Allyn Rose was being used bythe health abuse industry to encourage other women to do the same. PatriciaGreenberg, Director of Cancer Prevention at the Jonsson Comprehensive CancerCenter in Los Angeles, said that ‘preventive surgery’ was a “very reasonable”choice for someone with Rose’s family history and a genetic predisposition.’ DidI mention that the world is mad? Once again, not only are they giving women lesschance of survival by resorting to surgery when they have cancer they arewheeling them into operating theatres to be mutilated as a ‘precaution’ whenthey are perfectly fine. Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!! The system is insane and it is meantto be, but it only gets its way because so many people are equally insane andprogrammed to be. Here we come back to the manipulation of perception to believein all-knowing ‘experts’ – the policy promoted by famed Rothschild Zionistpropagandist Edward Bernays. He clearly didn’t take his own advice, however,because he lived to be 103. People tend to construct their sense of reality fromwhat ‘scientists’ say and their health or illness from what doctors say withboth underpinned by what ‘journalists’ say (repeat). This can be, and usuallyis, a fatal naïvety. I saw a quote that said: ‘Social engineering – the clevermanipulation of the natural human tendency to trust.’ That is bang on the nail.I have known so many people with cancer who have refused to even consider analternative route to health and instead have devastated their bodies withchemotherapy and radiation and then ... died. The program goes so deep that itbelieves those in authority must know what they are doing or they wouldn’t be inauthority. How can anyone else know what they are talking about when theyhaven’t even been to medical school or got their licence or been to university?Babes in arms so often become babes in cemeteries because their default positionis to look for protection from the mummy and daddy state. But the state isn’t amummy or daddy. It is a demonic monster with demonic intent.Culling the kidsChildren are often traumatised while still in the mother’s womb by the mother’smental and emotional state and experience. Then immense trauma comes with theBig Pharma hospital birth process which is designed to create distortion andperception blindness in mind, body and energy field. This is what trauma can doto people and it starts with the often drug-dosed brutality that we call ‘beingborn’. American researcher Jeanice Barcelo has done a great deal of work on thisand her website is called BirthofaNewEarth.com. Once a child is through thetrauma of birth the poisoning of mind and body through Big Pharma vaccinesbegins. You’ll find background detail, figures and facts about vaccinations inmy other books and I am only covering the subject at this point to place it incontext with the goals, aspirations and methods of the Archontic system of humansuppression and control. Vaccinations should be filed under Giant Hoax alongwith fluoride in drinking water, genetically-modified food, human-caused climatechange and all the other usual suspects. The human immune system is perfectlyfine by itself, thank-you, and all it needs is the nutrition and lifestyle thatallows it to perform most effectively. What it doesn’t need while it is stilldeveloping in the first two years of life is to be overwhelmed by a chemicalshit storm that means that the immune system will never be what it could havebeen because of the impact of this before it is fully-formed. We are now talkingabout 25 to 30 vaccinations before the age of two (and increasing all the time)and even more to age six and the teenage years (Fig 529). It was reported in2013 that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which pleaded guilty to the largest drugindustry scandal in recorded history, was working with an Indian pharmaceuticalcompany to develop a six-in-one for polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough,hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B in a single dose for the poorestand weakest people. Can you imagine what that tidal wave of toxic shite will doto them in one go? These vaccines contain: Aluminum – which causes dementia andAlzheimer’s disease; Antibiotics – too many makes you resistant them and theyhave other damaging effects; Formaldehyde – a highly-toxic chemical that cancause cancer (including myeloid leukemia), damage the brain and nervous system,and cause blindness and seizures; Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) – a brain toxinthat attacks neurons and can be fatal. It is outrageously used as a flavourenhancer in packaged tasteless crap which somehow becomes known as ‘food’;Thimerosal – lethally-toxic methyl mercury that can devastate the nervoussystem. We are told that mercury is a deadly poison, which it is, and then theyput it in vaccinations for children and adults (Fig 530). An independent reviewof child vaccines by the nonprofit US National Vaccine Information Center foundthat many contain aborted human foetal and altered DNA material, andgenetically-modified human blood protein (albumin). This brings me to two of theprime goals of vaccines – to cull the population by damaging the immune systemand mutate human genetics to create the purpose-built moronic human slave. Lookaround, they are already well on the way to getting there. DNA-mutatingingredients in vaccines and drugs have to be lined up alongsidegenetically-modified (GM/GMO) crops and food and genetically-mutatingelectromagnetic pollution – not least from cell phones – to see themulti-faceted war on human DNA and genetic function. In fact, they are nowmixing vaccines and GMO with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving agenetically-modified flu vaccine. Mike Adams at Naturalnews.com wrote:[../Images/00212.jpg]Figure 529: Welcome to Planet Earth – you’ll like it here.[../Images/00210.jpg]Figure 530: Get your flu shot or you might not get flu or have your immunesystem damaged for life.> A new vaccine for influenza has hit the market, and it is the first ever to> contain genetically-modified (GM) proteins derived from insect cells.> According to reports, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently> approved the vaccine, known as Flublok, which contains recombinant DNA> technology and an insect virus known as baculovirus that is purported to help> facilitate the more rapid production of vaccines.> According to Flublok’s package insert, the vaccine is trivalent, which means> it contains GM proteins from three different flu strains.

Billions and billions in profits are not enough andthe taxpayers whose immune systems they are devastating have to pay for thesource of that to be developed. Two participants died during trials for Flublokaccording to vaccine’s package insert by its manufacturer, the Protein SciencesCorporation. The serious nerve disease Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GSB) is alsolisted as a potential side effect: ‘If Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) hasoccurred within six weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine, the decisionto give Flublock should be based on careful consideration of the potentialbenefits and risks.’ What the fuck does that mean? If the first shot resulted inGuillain-Barre Syndrome careful consideration should be given on whether to haveanother one? Yeah, go on, stick it in, let’s see what I get this time. Jeeez. Itis claimed by vaccine promoters that they do not contain mercury, but here is aquote from the website of the US Government Centers for Disease Control andPrevention: ‘Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that is added tovials of vaccine that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination andgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria.’ A United Nations treaty bans the use ofmercury in products like batteries, lamps, switches, skin-lightening cosmetics,pesticides and thermometers by 2020 because it is so dangerous, but the treatymakes exceptions for mercury use ... for military and civil protection, productswith no mercury-free alternative, products used in religious or traditionalpractices and vaccines containing thimerosal, the ethyl mercury preservative.Now if this exemption was only sheer stupidity it would be a jaw-dropper, butmercury is being left in vaccines to specifically target human health and brainfunction especially in children who are more susceptible. This was staggeringlysupported by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) which endorsed the WHO’sludicrous con-clusion that thimerosal should not be considered a dangeroussource of mercury. Dr Walter Orenstein, a member of the AAP Committee onInfectious Diseases, said that keeping thimerosal in vaccines was essential‘mostly for humanitarian reasons’ – because vaccines without it would cost toomuch for developing countries. ‘For American parents, this is more looking atthe world and our role and responsibility in protecting the children of theworld than it is a direct impact’, he said. ‘We need this exception becausethimerosal is so vital for protecting children.’ I have heard some bollocks inmy life, but my goodness that’s right up there. Mercury researcher Dr I MTrakhtenberg wrote in Chronic Effects of Mercury on Organisms:> Chronic mercury exposure is also a threat to our health and makes us> especially vulnerable to flu infections.

This would explain why there is so much fluamong the vaccinated despite the flu shots and why a report from the US Centersfor Disease Control revealed that 91 percent of people over 65 who had the fluvaccine still ended up getting the flu. So the flu shot doesn’t stop you gettingthe flu? No. So why do you have it every year? Er, well, they say ‘get your flushot’.

The combined influenza vaccine,which contains the mercury-based preservative Thimerosal, was encouraged forpregnant women, but an investigation in Human and Environmental Toxicologyrevealed that after the mass immunisation of the duel vaccine miscarriages andstillbirths soared by an incredible 4,250 percent among vaccinated pregnantwomen. The number and type of vaccines are increasing as new reasons tovaccinate are invented on the most spurious ‘evidence’ with the aim of producingstill more money for Big Pharma and still more toxicity and damaged immunesystems and DNA for the target population. Dr Jay Lieberman of the Centers forDisease Control is reported to have made a presentation about thimerosal whichignored data about its dangers and while having connections to Big Pharmacompanies that use thimerosal in their products. This is a clear conflict ofinterest, but this is how Big Pharma works the world over.The system stinksDr Maurice Hilleman (1919-2005) developed nearly 40 vaccines for Merck and was amember of the US National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, theAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.He was also given a special lifetime achievement award from the World HealthOrganization. Yes, that’s how horrible his work must have been. Hilleman said inan interview later in life that vaccines given to Americans were contaminatedwith leukaemia and cancer viruses. Asked why the public had not been told hesaid: ‘Obviously you don’t go out [and tell the public], this is a scientificaffair within the scientific community.’ No, it’s not. It is an ‘affair’ aboutdead children and dead parents and others and the suffering of millions, butthis is the Archontic mentality that we are dealing with. Software would havemore heart and decency than these people and they are indeed demented. I havebeen told that vaccines also have time-release diseases encoded to activatelater in life. Cancer in children has soared since vaccines were introduced andit is not a brain teaser to see why. Dr Lucija Tomljenovic from the NeuralDynamics Research Group at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver,Canada, published an explosive exposé of British vaccine corruption called ‘Thevaccination policy and the Code of Practice of the Joint Committee onVaccination and Immunisation (JCVI): are they at odds?’ The 2013 paper was basedon official documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act andrevealed how the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), whichadvises the British Government on vaccine policy, had major ties to Big Pharma(of course, par for the course all over the world) and had suppressed evidenceand lied about vaccine dangers and anything that presented them in their truelight. Big Pharma own the agencies that decide state drug and vaccine policy andthose that are supposed to protect the public from such dangers and corruption.Dr Tomljenovic said in her report that vaccination is a medical intervention andshould be carried out with the full consent of those who are being subjected toit. This required an objective disclosure of the known or foreseeable risks andbenefits and, where applicable, a description of alternative courses oftreatment. Dr Tomljenovic said that in cases where children and infants wereinvolved full consent with regard to vaccination should be given by the parents.She went on:> Deliberately concealing information from the parents for the sole purpose of> getting them to comply with an ‘official’ vaccination schedule could thus be> considered as a form of ethical violation or misconduct. Official documents> obtained from the UK Department of Health (DH) and the Joint Committee on> Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) reveal that the British health authorities> have been engaging in such practice for the last 30 years, apparently for the> sole purpose of protecting the national vaccination program [Big Pharma and> the Archontic agenda].> Here I present the documentation which appears to show that the JCVI made> continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and> contraindications to vaccinations to both parents and health practitioners in> order to reach overall vaccination rates which they deemed were necessary for> ‘herd immunity’, a concept which with regards to vaccination, and contrary to> prevalent beliefs, does not rest on solid scientific evidence as will be> explained.> As a result of such vaccination policy promoted by the JCVI and the DH, many> children have been vaccinated without their parents being disclosed the> critical information about demonstrated risks of serious adverse reactions,> one that the JCVI appeared to have been fully aware of.

Dr Tomljenovic said that thetranscripts of JCVI meetings also confirmed that some of the Committee membershad extensive ties to pharmaceutical companies and that the JCVI frequentlycooperated with vaccine manufacturers on strategies aimed at boosting vaccineuptake. Some of the meetings at which such controversial items were discussedwere not intended to be publicly available and they were only released laterthrough the Freedom of Information Act (FOI). She said that these particularmeetings are denoted in the transcripts as ‘commercial in confidence’ and reveala clear and disturbing lack of transparency. Some of the information was removedfrom the text (including names of the participants) before being releasedthrough the Freedom of Information section of the JCVI website. None of this isa one-off or specific to the UK or even vaccines – the same happens worldwidewith Big Pharma drugs in general. Dr Tomljenovic’s list of conclusions equallyapplies everywhere in the same way:> 1) Instead of reacting appropriately by re-examining existing vaccination> policies when safety concerns over specific vaccines were identified by their> own investigations, the JCVI either a) took no action, b) skewed or> selectively removed unfavourable safety data from public reports and c) made> intensive efforts to reassure both the public and the authorities in the> safety of respective vaccines.> 2) [The JCVI] significantly restricted contraindication to vaccination> criteria in order to increase vaccination rates despite outstanding and> unresolved safety issues.> 3) On multiple occasions [it was] requested from vaccine manufacturers to make> specific amendments to their data sheets, when these were in conflict with> JCVI’s official advices on immunisations.> 4) Persistently relied on methodologically dubious studies, while dismissing> independent research, to promote vaccine policies.> 5) Persistently and categorically downplayed safety concerns while> over-inflating vaccine benefits.> 6) Promoted and elaborated a plan for introducing new vaccines of questionable> efficacy and safety into the routine paediatric schedule, on the assumption> that the licenses would eventually be granted.> 7) Actively discouraged research on vaccine safety issues.> 8) Deliberately took advantage of parents’ trust and lack of relevant> knowledge on vaccinations in order to promote a scientifically unsupported> immunisation program which could put certain children at risk of severe> long-term neurological damage.So why do they do this? (a) money; (b) they don’t give a shit about anyone butthemselves; (c) those in the shadows who orchestrate this deceit and corruptionknow exactly why they want the world’s children vaccinated – to ensure alifetime of profitable disease, block them off from the greater reality and cullthe population by targeting the immune system from the earliest age. Who is oneof the leading global advocates and funders of all this despite the starkevidence of what vaccines do? Bill Gates – with his missus in tow (Fig 531).Gates calls it ‘God’s work’. Well, the Saturn god, maybe. Dr Tomljenovic hasbecome a very vocal critic of vaccination disinformation along with hercolleague, neuroscientist Christopher Shaw. These are some other points DrTomljenovic makes about vaccine safety:[../Images/00214.jpg]Figure 531: Gates saving the children.> • Aluminium can break through the blood-brain barrier which protects the brain> from toxicity and therefore poison the brain.

Now there are calls to give the same vaccines to boysin the UK to ‘protect them from throat cancer’. They are already doing this inAustralia and the US Centers for Disease Control are recommending the same. Butof course they are – why would they not when they are only agents of Big Pharma?I can hear the kids’ immune systems screaming for mercy at the very thought ofthis insanity. Australian Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said of agreeing toinflict Gardasil on boys: ‘It’s a very exciting journey, an Australianinvention, a world-first vaccine for women and now a world-first vaccine foryoung men.’ Those words are going to stick in her throat for life eventually.The morons in government worldwide are extraordinary in both number and depth ofmoronity. Is there such a word as moronity? If there isn’t, there should be. Weneed it.Poison your child – it’s the lawThe campaign of misinformation, intimidation and demonisation of parents whorefuse to vaccinate (poison) their children is leading to mandatory vaccinationsand not only for children either. The state is insisting that you poison yourchildren and yourself – or else; and that you severely damage the immune systemsof your children and yourself – or else. I say again: what a definition oftyranny. Archontic inversion means that parents resisting the Big Pharmafascists are portrayed as child abusers because they refuse to allow theirchildren to be vaccinated or put through the deadly and useless nightmare ofchemotherapy. Parents are increasingly being made to do so by a programmed andcorrupt judiciary that takes its ‘values’ from equally programmed and corrupt‘medical experts’. The Archontic networks won’t take no for an answer unless wemake them because choice leaves people able to say no to their mind and bodybeing blitzed by toxins. Medical staff are already being fired for refusing tohave a flu vaccination that includes mercury; aluminium; Phenol (carbolic acid);Betapropiolactone, a disinfectant; Ethylene glycol (antifreeze); Triton X-100, adetergent; Sodium phosphate; Octoxinol 9, a vaginal spermicide; and Nonoxynolwhich is used to treat sexually-transmitted disease. They are not giving peoplea choice whether or not to have that lot injected in their bodies if they wantto keep their job? That is sheer fascism. In one of the most laughablejustifications for this Kathleen McManus, a Medical Center chief operatingofficer, said that officials had decided to make the shots mandatory becausevoluntary compliance has never topped 65 percent. Oh, so if you all agree to doit won’t be mandatory, but if you don’t it will be. But here’s the line ... ‘Thepeople we serve here are very sick and I will not put a patient at risk.’ Wordshave no meaning. This no vaccine-no job policy extends in the UK to doctors,nurses, firefighters, police and prison officers, forensic scientists and refusecollectors with the hepatitis B vaccine mandatory for such employment. It isclaimed that this is needed to protect them from infected blood, but try tellingthat to the 200 from those professions reported in the London Daily Express tobe suffering from serious physical and mental health problems as a result of themultiple vaccinations with 60 percent of sufferers now disabled. Some US stateshave sought to further limit rights for parents to opt out of vaccinations fortheir children including New Jersey through a bill proposed by Majority LeaderLoretta Weinberg (Rothschild Zionist). The Home School Legal Defense Associationtook on the case of a Pennsylvania couple after their new-born baby daughter wasforcibly taken by police and staff and given a hepatitis B vaccination againstthe will of the parents. The mother who had just given birth was escorted fromthe hospital by police. This is the arena that the world is sleepwalking into.Politicians are constantly batting for Big Pharma in return for the millions ofdollars given by the industry in political donations with Obama a majorrecipient. No surprise, then, that the tyranny known as Obamacare is incrediblyprofitable for the pharmaceutical industry and removes choice by making itcompulsory for everyone to have medical (Big Pharma) insurance with the alreadyfinancially-desperate facing fines from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ifthey don’t buy insurance. The IRS has said that by 2016 insurance will costfamilies of four and five a minimum of $20,000 a year. Obamacare has beenpromoted as giving healthcare to everyone, but it is just another ruse totransfer enormous sums from people and government (taxpayers) to healthinsurance corporations. Obama is so crooked it is a wonder he can walk straight.Here are just a few headlines from stories that I have in my research file whichI have collected in a few months.

The British Health Protection Agency (HPA)has even called for babies to be inoculated against whooping cough at birthbecause of an epidemic but what they don’t say is that the epidemic is happeningto vaccinated children. Oh, the vaccine obviously doesn’t work if we give it attwo months so we’ll give it at birth – that will fix it. The UK Guardianreported:> The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has asked the government’s vaccination> advisers to look at a number of options including immunising newborns. The> [whooping cough] vaccination is usually given to babies at two, three and four> months as part of a five-in-one dose, which also covers tetanus, polio,> diphtheria and Haemophilus influenzae type B.

It has recommended the> inoculation of healthcare workers in close contact with babies.Five-in-one dose?? What?? It is immune system homicide. But when peoplechallenge the insanity of the system turns its fire on them in unison – doctors,medical associations, government agencies, politicians, Big Pharma and media. DrAndrew Wakefield, a Canadian-trained gastroenterologist, was vilified andeventually struck off by the General Medical Council (GMC) after rightly makinga connection between mercury in vaccines and autism which has soared in unisonwith mercury in vaccines. The GMC trumped up a spurious ‘professionalmisconduct’ charge as an excuse to do the bidding of its Big Pharma masters whowould have been desperate to avoid the exposure of their health-destroyingvaccines and all the Big Pharma-destroying law suits that would follow.Wakefield questioned the impact of the combined measles, mumps and rubellavaccine, or ‘MMR’ in terms of both autism and bowel problems and only thecorrupt or idiotic could fail to see the connection between mercury in vaccinesand autism. Dr Rashid Buttar told the Congressional Reform and Oversight HearingSubcommittee on Wellness and Human Rights about his amazing results fromtreating autism simply by removing mercury from children’s bodies. His own son,Abi, made a full recovery from autism after mercury detoxification. Dr Bob Nash,chairman of the American Board of Clinical Metal Toxicology, said: ‘When 31children recover from a devastating disease by a simple transdermal treatmentthat detoxifies metals, then common sense dictates that perhaps metals areinvolved.’ Not to the Big Pharma cabal it doesn’t. They know about the link, butthey just don’t want the public to know. Instead the UK Advertising StandardsAuthority (ASA) ordered the website BabyJabs.co.uk to remove information thatquoted evidence of a link between vaccines and autism including that by DrWakefield. The ASA is the ‘self-regulatory organisation of the UK advertisingindustry’ – an industry that attracts enormous sums of money from Big Pharmaadvertising. ‘Scientists’ in the US and UK are also using a computerised globalmonitoring system which can track all social media activity challenging orquestioning the vaccine lies and report this to the authorities. Who hasprovided the funding? The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This man needs tohave the spotlight turned on him big-time. But while all this denial andcover-up goes on about the link between vaccines and autism, families are beingpaid millions in compensation after children develop autism in the wake ofvaccinations. The US Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (an arm of thecover-up) awarded millions to two children in January 2013 who developedvaccine-related autism, but at the same time it refused to admit that vaccinescause autism because then the floodgates would open. Both of these cases were‘unpublished’ to keep the contents of medical records and other evidence frompublic scrutiny. The evitable happened in 2013 when it was announced that avaccine had been developed for symptoms associated with, yes ... autism. AndrewWakefield was further vilified in early 2013 when an alleged measles ‘epidemic’broke out in Wales and was blamed on children not being immunised with the MMRbecause of Wakefield’s ‘scaremongering’. We were told that approaching athousand cases had been confirmed and frightened parents queued to have theirchildren vaccinated with the MMR including many who had refused it before. Iheard idiots in the media condemning Wakefield for what had happened and fearwas being promoted at every opportunity. But when the figures were officiallypublished it was revealed that the cases were a fraction of what had beenclaimed in terms of laboratory confirmations. Measles had been misdiagnosed byan astonishing margin – by up to 18,200 percent according to one analysis. Whatabout the vaccinated children that still got measles? What about thenonvaccinated children that didn’t? These were questions not asked by themainstream media because that was far too complicated for them – best just tobash Wakefield and repeat the government line. The idiots at the UK Telegraphnewspapers launched a campaign in the wake of the engineered panic in Wales toallow childcare and preschool centres to ban unvaccinated children under a ‘nojab, no play’ policy. Is there a vaccine for ignorance and stupidity? If so,contact Telegraph newspapers immediately. Another Big Pharma weapon in thedrug-vaccine cover-up is the draconian British libel laws. Henrik Thomsen fromCopenhagen University Hospital, one of Europe’s leading radiologists, was suedfor defamation by GE Healthcare, a subsidiary of General Electric, for what hesaid about the drug, Omniscan. Thomsen and other doctors could not understandwhy 20 kidney patients who had been given routine scans then developednephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). This makes the skin swell, thicken andtighten. One person died and others were confined to wheelchairs. It was laterconfirmed that the apparent common denominator was that all were given Omniscanto enhance the images produced by the scan. The Medicines and HealthcareProducts Regulatory Agency confirmed that there had been 20 cases of nephrogenicsystemic fibrosis in the UK after patients were given Omniscan and five peoplehad died. Henrik Thomsen now refuses to speak about the subject in the UK afterbeing issued with a libel writ for what he said about the drug. Another ruse toovercome the now greater parental awareness about the dangers of vaccines is toallow children as young as 12 to decide for themselves if they want to bevaccinated irrespective of what their parents think. Legislation has been passedto this effect in California and something similar is being proposed for Texas.Put all this madness and corruption together and you can see why the followingis predicted in the next few decades and I feel they are being optimistic. Thiscomes from the Agora-health website:> • Cancer is set to claim twice as many lives by 2030 than it does today,> according to official figures from the International Agency For Cancer> Research.> • Your odds of suffering a devastating heart attack or stroke have shortened> to greater than 1-in-3, according to the British Heart Foundation.> • Diabetes now affects over 220 million people globally and the consequences> of high blood sugar kill 3.4 million every year – a figure which is set to> double over the next fifteen years (source: World Health Organization)> • By 2030, a new case of dementia will be diagnosed every four seconds,> according once again to the World Health Organization.This and so much more is the result of toxic food and drink, stressful lifestyleand useless medicine. What makes it even worse is that it is all planned andcalculated for reasons that I will be documenting.Crushing the alternativeWhen your aim is to poison, irradiate and destroy the immune systems of thetarget human population the last thing you want is for alternatives to beavailable. You want all humans in your net, not only those that are solid-goldasleep. This is the reason for the ongoing assault by Archontic officialdomagainst alternative methods of healing, food supplements and fresh, organic,nonchemical food (Fig 532). A major global weapon in this war on alternatives tothe Archontic corporations which dominate medicine and food is called CodexAlimentarius (‘Food Code’ or ‘Food Book’). This is in the process of banningaccess to food supplements of adequate doses and quality that compensate for theloss of nutrients in our food and keep us protected from the diseases thesemadmen and women are concocting in their laboratories. They are using thesmokescreen of ‘harmonising’ food and supplement laws and regulations across theworld. You will notice the emergence of ‘international law’ and ‘internationaltreaties’ and this is the Totalitarian Tiptoe building the web of global laws inpreparation for a global government. Codex Alimentarius is aRothschild-Rockefeller front for Big Pharma, Big Food and Big Biotech to destroythe opposition. It was established in the 1960s by the Nazi war criminalsHermann Schmitz and Fritz ter Meer. Schmitz was president of the Nazi chemicalgiant, IG Farben, and Fritz ter Meer was an executive. This was the same IGFarben that ran the concentration camp at Auschwitz and Ter Meer had the phrase‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ (‘Work Makes Free’) placed over the main gate at the camp(Fig 533). Fritz ter Meer was also employed by Bayer, an IG Farben companycreated by his father, and, like Schmitz, Ter Meer was jailed by the Nurembergtrials for war crimes. He served only four of his seven year sentence thanks tothe intervention of his friend, Nelson Rockefeller, the four-times Governor ofNew York, and he was released to become supervisory board chairman of Bayer andto help launch Codex Alimentarius which is hijacking global food and supplementlaws on behalf of the Big Pharma cartel that includes the constituent parts ofIG Farben. The Codex Alimentarius Commission was officially established in 1963by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the WorldHealth Organization. It is recognised by the World Trade Organization whichgives Codex powers of enforcement. These are Archontic Rothschild-Rockefelleroperations the lot of them. We have Rothschild-Rockefeller fronts establishingother Rothschild-Rockefeller fronts with no public oversight while the worldlooks on and the global concentration camp is built step-by-step, day-by-day asthe inmates watch sport and game shows while they pop their pills. The table issystematically rigged against alternatives to Big Pharma and I know of peoplemaking cancer disappear after the system wrote them off, but they have to flyaround the world dodging the authorities to find safe havens where they can dotheir work of healing the sick. This is how corrupt and disgusting the systemis, but then it is designed to mass kill people and medicate the minds of thejust-about-living so you can see why those involved are so heartless andArchonticly callous and emotionless. The Court of Appeals in New York ruled thatit is fine for Big Pharma representatives to promote drugs for what are termed‘off-label uses’ – those used not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Circuit Judge Denny Chin said: ‘In the fields of medicine and public health,where information can save lives, it only furthers the public interest to ensurethat decisions about the use of prescription drugs, including off-label usage,are intelligent and well-informed.’ What by a drug rep only interested in thebottom line and peddling his potions? He is going to be intelligent andwell-informed about the possible consequences of off-label uses? What bullshit,but Big Pharma gets virtually whatever it wants. Meanwhile, alternativepractitioners can say virtually nothing about their non-pharmaceuticalalternatives without facing prosecution, big fines and even jail. If any healthbenefits are claimed or discussed for foods or dietary supplements they arereclassified as drugs – yes, even fruits and such like – and become subject toan impossibly expensive approval process by the Food and Drug Administration. Myclose friend Mike Lambert at the Shen Clinic on the Isle of Wight is doingfantastic work restoring the health of people that the system has tossed asidebut because he is doing that the authorities do everything they can to stop him.This even includes the deeply corrupt Isle of Wight Council that forced him outof his premises in the most disgusting way for the personal ends of those whocovertly control it. The contact details for the Shen Clinic are at the back ofthe book. I wrote about something called Salvestrols in an earlier book as atreatment for cancer, but in my view and experience these have been completelysuperseded now by the far more powerful and effective Resveratrol. This is not,however, just any Resveratrol, but the particular kind used and recommended byMike Lambert. I have been taking them for a year together with something calledQ10 (again not just any Q10, but Mike’s recommended Q10) and my health hasimproved in fantastic leaps. No, I am not on any commission, not a cent. I justwant others to have the benefits that I have had and those once with veryserious and life-threatening diseases who were sent home to die by Big Pharmamedicine. Studies carried out at universities in Germany, France and Asiasupport the potential qualities of this formula in certain types of cancer,cancer prevention, heart disease, and a whole host of other serious healthconditions and concerns. Resveratrol-V, containing this formula, is availablefrom Bio-Continuum.com. Another scam by the FDA is to rule that a naturalsubstance is a ‘drug’ and then award exclusive rights for its sale to a BigPharma corporation. This is what happened to an extract from a South Americantree known as dragon’s blood. The FDA classed it as a drug with a wave of thepen and gave sole rights to Salix Pharmaceuticals to sell it through NapoPharmaceuticals of San Francisco under the brand name Fulyzac to treat peoplewith diarrhoea caused by HIV drugs. The same happened to the natural hormonepregnenolone which can help to prevent miscarriage. The FDA ordered that itswidespread use be stopped and gave exclusive rights to KV Pharmaceutical whoimmediately increased the price by 15,000 percent. This denied the benefit to alarge number of mothers who could no longer afford it. What level of evil doesit take to run the FDA? It is almost unimaginable. The FDA with its corruptionand armed SWAT teams for added intimidation of its targets is nothing more thana fascist hit man in service for Big Pharma to destroy the opposition, stealnature and allow dangerous drugs and vaccines onto the market. It is worthwatching a documentary about the systematic destruction of alternative healthavailable on YouTube called We Become Silent: The Last Days of Heath Freedom.Funny, too, isn’t it, that drugs that can kill you and put you spiritually tosleep are promoted and protected by the authorities but psyche-opening drugswhich, if used properly in safe conditions can show you the illusion, arebanned. In fact, crazy of crazies, the federal government has banned thepossession or manufacture of a list of mind-opening substances includingDimethyltryptamine, or DMT, the main active ingredient in ayahuasca, which isnaturally produced (manufactured) by the human brain. Arrest that brain! Thisnonsense is designed to stop people using these substances to see through theillusion of the Matrix. The late great American comedian and deeper thinker,Bill Hicks, said: ‘I think it’s interesting the two drugs that are legal –alcohol and cigarettes, two drugs that do absolutely nothing for you at all –are legal, and the drugs that might open your mind up to realise how you’rebeing fucked every day of your life? Those drugs are against the law.Coincidence?’[../Images/00278.jpg]Figure 532: The Archontic network is seeking to destroy the remaining sources ofnutrition and alternative health care.[../Images/00199.jpg]Figure 533: Fritz ter Meer’s contributions to humanity – concentration camps andCodex Alimentarius. But his friend Nelson Rockefeller thoroughly approved.While I was writing this chapter the British Government’s Chief Medical Officer,the system-trained, Big Pharma-trained Professor Dame Sally Davies, ventured theopinion that homeopathy is ‘rubbish’ and that its practitioners are ‘peddlers’.This is no surprise because all government medical officers are Big Pharmagroupies, but it is still a headshaker that a professor and ‘Dame’, no less,could be so bewildered, so utterly devoid of perception filters, that she canaccuse anyone of ‘peddling’ when she gives her support to Big Pharma, thebiggest and most profitable killing machine on Earth and far outperforming eventhe war industry in producing dead and maimed people. These, too, are casualtiesof war – the war on human health and human existence for billions. When didalternative forms of treatment ever generate a headline like this: ‘Teenage girlwins $109 million payout after ibuprofen leaves her brain damaged, blind andcauses 90 percent of her skin to fall off’? Professor Dame what’s-her-namebrings us full circle as a classic representative of theeducation-medical-science-lawyer-media programming machine. She thinks thathomeopathy is ‘rubbish’ because she has no idea what the body is or how it worksand so what homeopathy is actually doing. She is another arrogant academiceducated to the point of idiocy, and the system is full of them because it setsout to make them so. The education system brings them all to a certain level ofprogramming – the base programming – and then off they go into theirspecialisation. Each specialisation of science, medicine, politics, law, mediaand so on supports the belief- systems of all the others because they have allbeen taught by the time they leave school and university that mainstreamscience, medicine, finance, law and authority knows best. This is, after all,where the ‘experts’ come from. All of these specialisations take their realityreference from all the others and so if parents are taken to court for notagreeing to have their child put through chemotherapy the judge will side withthe doctors who ‘know best’. All this is reported by the media which is largelyjust another specialisation of the same base program. This is why the mainstreammedia slavishly follows the party line of science, medicine, finance, law andauthority in general and produces a stream of correspondents and ‘experts’,including doctors, who spew out the program 24/7. The BBC has a ‘MedicalCorrespondent’ called Fergus Walsh whom I have watched for years parroting theBig Pharma propaganda and establishment medical line while being ignorant abouthis subject. It turns out he is married to a former GP who now works in thepharmaceutical industry. I can’t say that my spine stiffened with an electricalsurge when I read that. If Fergus Walsh ever said anything on air that wasn’tfrom the Big Pharma song sheet I would expect him to implode immediately due tocellular shock. I wonder if there is a drug for that? Or a vaccine? Maybe hiswife knows.[../Images/00428.jpg]Figure 534: The frenzy of perception programming.So this is the system of conditioning and preparation that moulds the minds ofthe overwhelmingly unknowing foot soldiers of the Perception Deception who, withtheir strings pulled secretly from the shadows, deluge the human population witha lifetime of propaganda and programming (Fig 534). This is done because thehidden masters well know that if you put bollocks in you will get bollocks out."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00039.jpg]Archon PoliticsThere is only one good: knowledge; and one evil: ignorance.SocratesNone of the system’s specialisations or the system itself could function withoutlaws to impose their will, programming and propaganda. This is where anotheroffspring of ‘education’ comes in that we call ‘government’. This is thespecialisation of all specialisations (apart from banking) in that it has thepower to dictate the structure of human society, how the money is shared out (ifthe banks agree), how the young are ‘educated’ and who goes to war with whom.Well, in theory. Governments are really just the up-front illusion to kid thepeople that they have a say in their own destiny and who governs them. Yes,governments are there to govern – ‘To control the actions or behaviour of: Tokeep under control; restrain.’ Words are important because they are vibrationalinformation fields that tell you a great deal about the true meaning of a termor name. People have to be in denial that they are being manipulated for them tobe manipulated most effectively and so the real power structure in the unseenhas to be hidden by the illusory power structure in the seen. This is what isknown as government and politics in general. Openly tyrannical governments canserve Archontic interests, but until the people can be brought under completemind and body control the tyrannies are always open to overthrow by the masseswho can see the obvious fact that they live in a tyranny. It is far moreeffective if you can operate a tyranny disguised as freedom and democracy. Thesetwo words are linked together to make them apparently interchangeable whendemocracy is anything but freedom. Democracy is an elected tyranny –theoretically elected much of the time. It is at best a dictatorship by themajority and usually not even that with the majority voting for parties otherthan the alleged winner. But what the people do at the ballot box or with themodern electronic voting systems really doesn’t matter. This is even more truewith electronic voting – because how do you know that what you press is what isregistered? You don’t and how people stand for this is incredible to me.Political parties and leaders tell you what they will and won’t do if you votefor them and on this basis most people make a decision on who to support – apartfrom those that are so asleep that they vote for the same party every timewithout question. These political pledges are not like a salesman saying that ifyou buy this vacuum cleaner this is what it will do. When you buy a productthere is a contract with the seller that says this must do what it says it willdo. If it doesn’t, you can take it back for a refund and if people sell shoddygoods in any number they can even go to jail. But with shoddy politicians it’sdifferent and they are far more dangerous than something that fails to suck upthe dog hairs. The political suck-up (it rhymes with another politicalspeciality) is the suck-up to corporations, bankers and other fellow bastions ofhuman control, suppression and exploitation which comprise the Archontichierarchy of professional parasites. The political system parasitizes off thelabour and effort (energy) of the people and passes laws that allow thecorporations, banks and the whole cabal to do the same. At their inner core theyare all worshipping and serving the Archontic-Satanic ‘gods’ and advancing theirplans for human subjugation (Fig 535). Politicians secure office through theircorruption and mendacity by telling would-be voters what they will do in power,but the absence of any contract means that they don’t have to do any of it. Wesee all the time that they mostly do the opposite – witness the reams ofpromises broken by Obama including not closing the fascist abomination atGuantanamo Bay when he said it would be closed in his first year in office in2009 (Fig 536). Julia Gillard, the deeply Archontic Prime Minister of Australia,said before coming to power that her government would never introduce a carbontax but then did exactly that (as she always knew she was going to). The LiberalDemocrats in Britain said they wouldn’t support an increase in student tuitionfees, but then did so. The list of lies could circle the Earth many times. Theabsence of a contract means that all votes are irrelevant because you are votingfor the unknown when what is said before an election is so blatantly not done inoffice right across the world. In the Gillard case a contract with the peoplewould mean that if you say you will not introduce a carbon tax before anelection then you can’t do so until after another election at which you say youwill. Yes, of course circumstances change and there has to be some leeway, butnot with open and shut pledges such as ‘I will close Guantanamo Bay’, ‘I willnot introduce a carbon tax’ and ‘I will not support an increase in tuitionfees’.[../Images/00100.jpg]Figure 535: Archon strongholds all of them.[../Images/00151.jpg]Figure 536: Barack Obama ... monumental fraud.[../Images/00113.jpg]Figure 537: Liar, Liar.The political system will never agree to such honesty and integrity because ithas the Archontic agenda to advance although, once again, 95 percent of those wecall politicians won’t realise that this is what they are doing. The fivepercent are working for the agenda in full knowledge of the who, what, why andwherefores, but the rest will be doing what the hidden forces and manipulatorswant through desire for money, status and illusory power, or through ignorance,fear of an ‘accident’, or fear of their secrets (often involving children) beingexposed if they dare to go their own way. There are genuine politicians battlingwithin a thoroughly rigged system, but in terms of a percentage not that manybecause the system infiltrates the perceptions of nearly all of them to someextent and usually massively so. This is why politicians lie all the time (Fig537). If they told the truth of why they are introducing this or doing that theywould go to jail and the political system would collapse. ‘We want to take gunsaway from American citizens while the state is armed to the teeth with high-techweaponry because then we can launch our fully-blown coup in which the peoplewill have to do what we say or we’ll shoot them knowing that nothing can comeback the other way.’ As election winners go I’d say that needs a little morerefining. So you see what I mean – politicians have to lie or their arses wouldbe doing a fly-past. How far would Tony Blair and Boy George Bush have got with... ‘Forces that control both of us staged the fake terrorist attacks on 9/11 sothat we can justify invading country after country and deleting the most basicfreedoms of the domestic population?’ Or ... ‘We are announcing tonight thatSaddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction that he could use against us whennone of this is true so you will support the invasion of Iraq to steal their oiland seize another country in the plan to control the whole of Africa and theMiddle and Near East’. Yep, I bet the people would have been on the streets indroves cheering them on ... as the prison van went past (Fig 538). The genuinelyArchontic politicians, as opposed to the Archonticly manipulated ones, also haveto lie because they know nothing else. Their foundation technique and method ofoperation is inversion and lying is simply an inversion of the truth. This iscrucial to understand when you are listening to political speeches and hearingtheir pledges and promises. You have to reverse – invert – what they say to hearwhat they are really saying. Others in the Archontic loop know this and so theyare listening to the same words in a very different way. They know what whenBush and Blair say that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that theyaren’t; that when Gillard says so vehemently that she will not introduce acarbon tax that she just as vehemently will; and that when Obama says hebelieves in a free society that what he really wants is an Orwellian tyranny.Jesse Jackson, the American ‘civil rights’ leader. No, sorry, that’s too much,got to catch my breath. Okay, try again. Jesse Jackson, the alleged/self-styled‘civil rights’ leader, is a perfect example of political inversion. He promoteshimself as a man of the people, especially black people, and yet he is a man ofthe system and user of the system who is owned by the system and so is a servantof the system (Fig 539). Jackson, a crooked fraud, went on television in ablood-stained shirt claiming to have held the assassinated Martin Luther King inhis arms on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968.Trouble is, he didn’t. Jackson wasn’t even on the balcony when King was shot –so where did the ‘blood’ come from? Kenneth Timmerman, author of Shakedown:Exposing the Real Jesse Jackson, said:[../Images/00087.jpg]Figure 538: If there is a half-truth in a Blair speech it’s a typing error.[../Images/00194.jpg]Figure 539: Jesse Jackson – used car, anyone?> Jesse Jackson was not up on the balcony.

He had no prospects at that point.> The next morning, he flew to Chicago and went on the NBC ‘Today Show.’ In the> meantime, he had hired a public relations agent.

The PR agent takes him to> the NBC ‘Today’ show, he appears in a shirt that he claims is smeared with Dr> Martin Luther King’s blood and he says on national television, ‘He died in my> arms’ – an absolute, patent lie.Jackson has not stopped lying, manipulating, serving his masters and becomingvery rich ever since. He called for the Orwellian and much-despised TransportSecurity Administration (TSA) to be unleashed with guns onto the streets ofChicago to deal with a big increase in gun crime and murders in the wake of someof the strictest gun control laws in America. The two are not unconnected, ofcourse. Jackson also referred to those opposing gun seizure laws to bring aboutthis same situation all over America as domestic terrorists who should bedisarmed. All these points are straight off the wish list of the ArchonticHomeland Security and Jackson was serving his masters all along while claimingto do the opposite. This is the political modus operandi of the Archons.One mask – many facesThe political system is a vital cog in the control system because it empowersall the other cogs, but it is only a creation, pawn and tool of the Archonticrealm that projects its fake Matrix into our reality through Big Government, BigPharma, Big Biotech, Big Oil, Big Food, Big War, Big Media, Big Science, BigAcademia and Big Law. All these are run by people who have first been preparedand programmed by the education system. The Demiurge-Archons manipulate humansociety via their bloodline families and together they suppress and distorthuman perception while feeding off the fear and other low-vibrational humanmental and emotional energy that their system is designed to generate (Fig 540).It is a perceptual-perpetual motion machine with humans as both the slaves andthe power source. The Archons ruled human society through their royal andpriestly dynasties for thousands of years, but the time came when humans hadreached a point of awareness in which they began to reject overt rule by genetichierarchy and, to a large extent, priestly hierarchy. There was a danger duringthis transition period that the Archontic bloodlines would lose their power, butthey survived and prospered by replacing royal dynasties, except for a few thatremained, with political dynasties and, crucially, political parties. When thefew seek to control the many the power has to be concentrated or it cannot bedone. The more you diversify decision-making the less power can be concentratedat the centre and the less the few sitting at the centre can dictate to everyoneelse. Globalisation, the European Union, United Nations, World HealthOrganization, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and WorldBank are deliberately created concentrations of power for the Archontic few toincrease their hold over the human many. It is the same with their planned worldgovernment, central bank, army and currency. When the monarchies fell, thisconcentration of Archontic power was potentially in danger before politicalparties were established to fill the void. What are political parties?Concentrated power. The danger with the demise of the Archontic royal dynastieswas that power would be diversified and people chosen for positions ofadministration and influence by the strength of their character and integrityinstead of, as now, by the colour of their rosette and the name of their party.The concept of political parties soon put a block on any chance of that.Political parties are structured like all Archonticly-inspired organisations ashierarchical pyramids. The tiny few at the top dictate policy and personnelthroughout the pyramid via their gofers and subordinates. Political partyhierarchies simply replaced the royal hierarchies (in theory and officially atleast) and the route into government was now by political rather than royalpatronage (once again, officially at least). The major parties attract all thecampaign funding from the big corporate donors who hand over their money with awhole web of strings attached and parties are also the focus of all thepolitical media coverage. If you try to run for political office outside of themajor political parties you are going to struggle for money to finance aneffective campaign and you are certainly not going to compete for media coverageto get your message across. How many people can name another candidate runningfor US president in November 2012 apart from Barack Obama and Mitt Romney? Therewere actually many, most of them even attached to small political parties, butthey were lost without trace to American voters. The money went to the Democratsand Republicans along with all the cameras and so, as a result, did almost allof the votes; but officially voters made their ‘choice’ (Fig 541).[../Images/00098.jpg]Figure 540: The structure of control. Human society is a fear factory – bydesign.Any serious would-be member of Congress or Parliament, let alone any futurepresident, prime minister or other member of government, has to first join amajor political party – the two (mostly) or three (sometimes) in every countrywith any chance of winning an election. The first part is easy, you just applyto join, pay your membership fee and you’re in. But representing that party at anational election is far from easy. You must persuade party officials that youare the one who should run for office in their area and to do that you need toagree to present and promote ‘party policy’ which has been decided by the few atthe peak of the party pyramid together with those in the shadows that actuallycontrol the pyramid. The centralised control of parties is now fiercer than everand if you are not acceptable to the hierarchy the chances are you won’t getanywhere. Let us say that you are selected and you are elected to Parliament orCongress. If you are to progress through the ranks from there to become a leaderor spokesperson for the party, and potentially a member of a government, youmust show what is called ‘party loyalty’. This means doing whatever thehierarchy tells you to do in arguing for and voting for whatever they tell you.Personal beliefs and perceptions don’t matter. You are not there to serve yourconscience and the people who elected you. The party line is what counts – theparty is your god – or you can kiss goodbye to any further progress up thegreasy pole. Parties even employ people called whips to make sure that membersof the party in political office vote in accordance with the demands of thehierarchy and the whips can threaten any potential rebels with dire consequencesin terms of their career and even their secrets being revealed, if they don’tcome to heel. The Archontic networks in and behind the political system like tohave politicians who are paedophiles and others with much to hide for thisreason. By the time you get anywhere near the top you are already thoroughlycompromised as you lie, fake and stab your way through all the other liars,fakes and hatchet men and women who were standing in your path. I experiencedpolitics briefly from the inside in the 1980s and it is thoroughly and totallycorrupt – breathtakingly so. This includes moral-high-ground, purest-of-the-pureself-delusionals such as the Green Party. The political system like everythingin this reality is a waveform construct resonating within a particular (lowvibrational) frequency band and you have to be a very strong person in terms ofyour values and integrity for you not to be vibrated into line in the same waythat the strongest frequency entrains the others. I have watched even those whoentered politics for apparently genuine reasons be turned with the years intoeverything they once abhorred. The political parties and their realm and methodsof operation are so stitched up and corrupt that the originally genuine persuadethemselves that they have to ‘compromise’ to get things done and progress up theparty to a position where they can change things. But one compromise followsanother and by the time they get into a position to ‘change things’ they havebecome everything they once wanted to change. Others are corrupt from the startand want to be in politics for their own ends. These people are willing to doand say anything to secure political office and also a backhander here and therewould do very nicely thank you. Politics is full of these people and they areused to constant effect by the Archontic networks. The leading politicians inthe leading positions like presidents and prime ministers are chosen at a youngage, often even at birth or before birth in the specifically-seeded upperechelons of the Archontic bloodlines. These will be the most demonised andArchonticlypossessed. Presidents like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama would havebeen chosen long before they even went into politics and the system manipulatedand rigged to put them in the White House. Others like Tony Blair and DavidCameron would have been marked down for British Prime Minister long before thepublic had even heard of them. ‘Elected’ leaders are chosen by the Archonticnetworks that spew them out all over the world and many will be from Rothschild,Rockefeller and other famous Archontic bloodlines brought up under other names.Picking your presidents and prime ministers way ahead of time knowing they willbe ‘elected’ is not as difficult as you would think when you control the money,all the parties and the media, and you know the skeletons of all the potentialrivals of your chosen men or women. Your control of all the major parties meansthat you control the apparently rival candidates anyway and so when you want topromote your chosen Obama as the young, new and vibrant wind of change you havehim put against an aged dinosaur like John McCain with a running mate in SarahPalin who could not win a debate if she was the only one in the room.[../Images/00015.jpg]Figure 541: You are free people – you have a political choice.One-party statesThe illusion of freedom and people-power is achieved by having the same forcetake multiple forms, all of which appear to be ‘different’. The American systemserves as the simplest example of how the one-party state is hidden behind thedelusion of choice but they all operate to the same design. Firstly, let’s havea look at this ‘choice’. The United States has more than 300 million people andyet they are given only TWO choices (actually the same ‘choice’) on who is goingto run the country? TWO? This is ridiculous, but perfect for the Archonticnetworks because two is only one more than their ideal which is ... er, one. Ifyou are going to hide the one-party state then two is the least you are going toget away with and so two is the best option with the least complication andmargin for error. The structure of one-party control is that you have twoparties, or rather one party with two different names. Each party is controlledby a cabal in the background which is there to control party policy and selectits personnel. Then these two ‘party’ cabals answer to a higher cabal and atthis point the ‘two’ parties are actually the same one. The ‘Republican’ Partyof Boy George Bush was dominated by a group known as the neocons orneo-conservatives – people like Elliott Abrams (Rothschild Zionist); RichardPerle (Rothschild Zionist); William Kristol (Rothschild Zionist); WilliamBennett (Rothschild Zionist); John Bolton (Rothschild Zionist); Douglas JayFeith (Rothschild Zionist); David Frum (Rothschild Zionist); Robert Kagan(Rothschild Zionist); Henry Kissinger (Rothschild Zionist); Michael Ledeen(Rothschild Zionist); Lewis ‘Scooter’ Libby (Rothschild Zionist); Karl Rove(Rothschild Zionist); Donald Rumsfeld (Rothschild Zionist); Paul Wolfowitz(Rothschild Zionist); James Woolsey (Rothschild Zionist); Dov Zakheim(Rothschild Zionist); and Robert Zoellick (Rothschild Zionist). The Obama‘Democratic’ Party has a similar group which I call the Democons – people likethe Clintons (Rothschild Zionists); Rahm Emanuel (Rothschild Zionist); DavidAxelrod (Rothschild Zionist); David Zbigniew Brzezinski (Rothschild Zionist,whatever he may claim); George Soros (Rothschild Zionist); and (currently) HenryKissinger (Rothschild Zionist). These groups (different facets of one group)then take their orders from the hidden cabal dominated by the Rothschilds,Rockefellers and others who own and control both parties. This means that nomatter which party is theoretically in power through the ‘will of the people’this Rothschild Zionist hidden cabal is in power (Fig 542). This is why you seepresidents and parties who had opposed the government they replaced come in anddo exactly the same. The agenda for the global Orwellian state continues nomatter what the nature and colour of the government in virtually all countriesbecause of the structure of hidden control that I have described here.Politicians have to lie to cover this. Obama attacked Bush’s policies and thencame in to be Bush on steroids and Rothschild Zionist David Cameron in Britainis just a face-transplant of Rothschild Zionist ‘opponent’ Tony Blair (Fig 543).Even Blair revealed in 2013 that he was giving ‘advice’ to Cameron. At thislevel of politics they know exactly what they are doing and why, and they knowthey are lying when they make their pledges because they know that they aregoing into office to continue the Rothschild agenda and make it business asusual. This is a cinch without any form of contract with the public and if youthrow them out at the next election for going back on their promises that’s noproblem. What is your only other choice in the rigged party system? Voting forthe other party which is also controlled by the same force (Figs 544 and 545).The ‘free world’ is an illusion. It never was and it never will be until we makeit so by putting these networks and families under lock and key where they cando no further harm.[../Images/00042.jpg]Figure 542: Two ‘sides’, one controller.[../Images/00270.jpg]Figure 543: choices, choices.[../Images/00414.jpg]Figure 544: choices, choices.You see that I have put Rothschild Zionist after the names in control of bothAmerican parties. This doesn’t mean that every single one is necessarily Jewishalthough the great majority are. I am using the term Rothschild Zionist toindicate those with strong connections, support and advocacy for the RothschildZionist cause and who are in the Rothschild web of influence. As Obama VicePresident Joe Biden said while on his knees with his tongue out: ‘You don’t haveto be Jewish to be a Zionist.’ But the fact that so many Jewish people are insuch concentrated numbers at the centre of both American parties when theyrepresent less than two cent of the population is an elephant in the living roomthat most people are too uninformed or frightened to see. For those peoplehere’s a little hint (Fig 546). Rothschild Zionists completely controlled thePentagon through Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary PaulWolfowitz (the real power), budget controller Dov Zakheim and people likeRichard Perle and Douglas Feith before, during and after 9/11 when overseasinvasions began in the wake of the staged attacks. This group included the verypeople who authored the Project for the New American Century report published inSeptember 2000 calling for a list of countries in North Africa and the Near andMiddle East to be conquered in ‘multiple-theater wars’. What a coincidence thatthey should be in just the positions they needed to be one year later at thetime of 9/11 to implement just that policy. The Bush White House before, duringand after 9/11 was controlled by Rothschild Zionists Karl Rove, Senior Advisorand Deputy Chief of Staff to Bush, and the convicted crook, Lewis ‘Scooter’Libby, adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney (Rothschild Zionist). Many Bushspeeches, including the one about the ‘Axis of Evil’ (Iraq, Iran and NorthKorea), were written by Rothschild Zionist David Frum from the AmericanEnterprise Institute, a bedfellow of the Project for the New American Century.The head of the Federal Reserve controlling US financial policy throughout theReagan-Bush and Clinton administrations and most of Boy Bush’s was AlanGreenspan (Rothschild Zionist) who was followed in the late Bush and Obama eraby Ben Bernanke (Rothschild Zionist). Anyone think that Rothschild Zionists,less than two percent of the population, might have been running the country andorchestrating the wars that Israel and the Rothschilds wanted?? Both PaulWolfowitz and Robert Zoellick (Rothschild Zionists) went on to be heads of theWorld Bank with Wolfowitz forced to resign in a corruption scandal. Surely not.Henry Kissinger (Rothschild Zionist) is in both camps because although normallya Republican he has been advising Obama on foreign policy (killing as manypeople as they can get away with). Kissinger has been a major agent of theArchontic Cabal for the last half a century and more. William Bennett, by theway, another in the neocon list, is one of the two Bennett brothers thatmind-control victim Cathy O’Brien describes putting her through themind-manipulation process in which people at a White House cocktail partyappeared to be reptilian.[../Images/00334.jpg]Figure 545: The political system as it really is.[../Images/00299.jpg]Figure 546: I don’t see any elephant, where is it?Barack Obama took with him to the White House his Chief of Staff (handler) RahmEmanuel (Rothschild Zionist) and Senior Advisor and election campaign chief(handler) David Axelrod (Rothschild Zionist). Emanuel went on to be Mayor of theRothschild fiefdom of Chicago, the political cesspool from which Obama andAxelrod also slid. His father, Benjamin Emanuel (real name Ezekiel Auerbach),was a Russian Jewish operative with the Irgun terrorist group that helped tobomb, murder and terrorise Israel into existence in 1948. A British officialquoted by American journalist Wayne Madsen said father Emanuel’s speciality wasbus bombing. His son’s speciality in the White House was also bombing – thistime from the sky – so long as someone else did the dirty work (Fig 547). Ifonly he had stayed with his original career the world would be a much betterplace even if ballet audiences would have suffered (Fig 548). Benjamin Emanuelwas one of many Rothschild Zionist agents who were relocated to America afterthe establishment of Israel to produce children born as American citizens tohijack the US political process – people like Rahm Emanuel who has become one ofAmerica’s foremost political fixers. His brothers are Ezekiel Emanuel, an Obamahealth (death) policy adviser, and Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood agent who representsthe interests of ‘radical’ filmmaker Michael Moore, the Obama campaigncontributor, whose film, Fahrenheit 911, glossed over the real story whileanother, Bowling for Columbine, was an attack on gun ownership in line with theArchontic agenda to disarm Americans before embarking on the final militarytakeover. The Emanuels and Moore’s mate, Obama, would thoroughly approve.Obama’s personal advisors on policy, known by the media as ‘czars’, are awashwith Rothschild Zionists and the ratio is almost comically greater than a meanaverage from less than two percent of the population. The themes, methods andstructure I have described in America can be found everywhere because it is theglobal Blueprint – remember the story I told earlier of how ‘competing’ BritishPrime Ministers Edward Heath (‘Conservative’) and Harold Wilson (‘Labour’) bothanswered to Lord Victor Rothschild while one or the other was in Downing Streetfor the entire period between 1964 and 1975. Another ruse of thetwo-party-one-party system is to give each party an image for what they standfor and then have them do in office the opposite of what people think theyrepresent. The reason is that if you have an image of being in favour of biggovernment then people are looking and waiting ... ‘see, look what they’re doing– typical’. But if you get the party with the image of being against biggovernment to introduce the more extreme big government then this is less likelyto be focussed upon in anything like the same way. Obama and the Democrats hadan image of being anti-war and pro-freedom and they have been able to go to warand destroy the most basic freedoms without anything like the protest that BoyBush would have had – and did have – with the Republican image for beingwar-mongering freedom-busters.[../Images/00118.jpg]Figure 547: Rahm Emanuel and his terrorist father.[../Images/00325.jpg]Figure 548: This pose is known in ballet as ‘The Manipulator’.All hands to the tyrannyRothschild Zionism is one of the most important ‘cements’ that holds theArchontic web together along with the networks of the Roman Church and it’ssecret societies like the Jesuits, Knights Templar and Opus Dei and theArchontic power centres in Britain (The City), Germany, France, Belgium, theUnited States, Australia and elsewhere which involve a network of secretsocieties, paedophilia and satanic groups very much including the upper levelsand most hidden levels of Freemasonry. One of the most significant in the UnitedStates is the Skull and Bones Society alongside the campus at Yale University inConnecticut with which the Bush family have long and strong connections. Thefather and son presidents are both Skull and Bones initiates and so is Obama’sSecretary of State John Kerry (Rothschild Zionist) who took over from HillaryClinton (Rothschild Zionist) in early 2013. Skull and Bones initiates are atiny, tiny fraction of the American population but the 2004 presidentialelection was ‘contested’ by Boy George Bush (Skull and Bones ‘Republican’) andJohn Kerry (Skull and Bones ‘Democrat’). This is called ‘democracy’ and anyonecan become president (Fig 549). When Kerry was questioned at a public eventabout his Skull and Bones membership the questioner was removed by police andtasered. A central part of the Skull and Bones initiation ritual is to lie nakedin a coffin (death – Archons/Saturn) with a ribbon tied to your willy while youreveal your sexual secrets. These people are running our world. The control ofpolitical parties with any chance of forming a government is vital to the wholeplan because then you can make at least most of what you do ‘legal’ – notdecent, humane or justified, but ‘legal’ by passing laws that sanction whateveryou want to do. Through the political system you can then also control theeducation system, banking law, corporate law, Big Pharma and medical law, whogoes to war with whom and so on (Fig 550). As a cartoon that I saw said: ‘...you can turn any criminal organisation into a political one by simply legalisingevery crime you’re going to commit.’ I will expose at length later the Archonticplans for humanity which are so clearly unfolding today so we can have theawareness to scupper them, but I need to lay out the basic themes of what isplanned here to put governments and politics into context. The Archons want aworld with an enormously reduced population which is so chemically andpsychologically programmed and genetically reengineered through food additives,pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines, genetically-engineered food, microchips,other technology and electromagnetic influences that they will be mental andemotional zombies on a scale that would make humanity today look wide awake. Themasses would be kept in total poverty under the jackboot and 24/7 surveillanceof a vicious, heartless global Police State peopled by those who would bethemselves totally programmed to do what they do. We are seeing this now evermore obviously with the software in uniform. This plan for mass poverty is whythe global economy has been crashed on purpose and countries like Greece drivenalmost overnight into extreme levels of financial and social deprivation. Theyintend to repeat this everywhere if we allow them to, by lack of action throughlack of credulity at what is really happening. The Archontic plan is for a fewstaggeringly wealthy bloodline families to live in high-tech luxury served bythe working masses entrapped in ‘sectors’ and stacked in high-rise ‘populationzones’.[../Images/00226.jpg]Figure 549: Skull and Bones v Skull and Bones.[../Images/00311.jpg]Figure 550: I repeat this image from earlier to show where presidents and otherpolitical leaders really stand in the hierarchy. They change the ‘law’ to suitthe agenda of those that control them.This is the real reason for the fantastic transfer of wealth from people andgovernments to banks (Archon families) since the engineered crash of 2008. Ifyou are waiting for an economic recovery then forget it, because unless weintervene it is not coming because that is not the plan. The idea is toprogressively make it worse and worse until they achieve the goal of totalsubjugation. Small and independent businesses around the world are constantly –and rightly – complaining about government financial policies, taxation andmountains of regulations and red tape that are making it increasingly impossibleto survive and compete with the corporations; but this is precisely theArchontic agenda at work. Small and independent businesses represent diversity –the very antipathy of the Archons who want their mega corporations to controleverything. The so-called middle class (many running small businesses) are nowbeing targeted for economic destruction because they are nowhere near highenough in the food chain to qualify for the luxury Archontic cities. The plan isfor no middle class just the mega rich and poverty-stricken. For those who shaketheir heads, look again. It is happening now, drip, drip, drip. The cost ofeverything is also being artificially inflated by governments and corporations,not least in terms of food, fuel and energy, to hasten the economic subjugationof the masses. People are already in desperate straits with children andfamilies going hungry in America and Europe as well as in those parts of theworld where hunger has always been commonplace. But food control = peoplecontrol and that is what this is all about. History is awash with dictatorshipskilling the target population often through starvation. Millions died this wayin the Ukraine in the ‘Great Famine’ of the 1930s when Soviet leader andRothschild asset Josef Stalin set out to destroy peasant people who would notcome into line. He blocked grain supplies and those that were available went tothe troops preventing the peasants from revolving. Meanwhile, Stalin wasexporting grain on a vast scale to fund his industrialisation. The Archonnetworks would not commit mass murder? They have been doing so for thousands ofyears at least. They are insane, without empathy or emotion. Of course theywould – and love it. Many have observed that there is never enough money forpeople but always enough for wars. This is undeniably true and the reason is nowsurely obvious. The Archon families and their hidden masters want humans tosuffer and die while constant wars and conflict are essential both to their planfor human enslavement and as an energy source. The British Conservativegovernment of David Cameron is the personification of privilege imposingsystematic poverty. Cameron said of the crippling austerity programme that heand his Chancellor of Exchequer George Osborne have imposed: ‘We are all in thistogether.’ Oh really? Cameron comes from a filthy rich banking family withserious connections to the Rothschilds and he married into the filthy richerfamily of Sir Reginald Adrian Berkeley Sheffield, 8th Baronet, a landownerdescended from King Charles II. Cameron and his wife, Samantha, have a commondecent from the Bible-mistranslating Satanist James I – she through Charles IIand his long-time mistress Nell Gwyn and Cameron through William IV. SamanthaCameron is also descended from the 19th century slave owner William Jolliffe whowas paid compensation of £4,000 (£3.25 million today) for losing 164 sugarplantation slaves in St Lucia at the time of the Abolition Act of 1833. TheArchontic bloodlines are weaved into the very fabric of the Establishment withCameron also a cousin of his university buddy, Boris Johnson, the professionalbuffoon now Mayor of London. They both descend from the German ‘English’ king,George II. Cameron is the 19th British Prime Minister to emerge from the El-liteEton College where royal children are perception-programmed. He was also amember, with George Osborne and Boris Johnson, of the exclusive Bullingdon Clubat Oxford University whose members are infamous for getting blind drunk andwrecking restaurants, pubs and cars with the damage paid for by their richparents. Their ritual chant is apparently: ‘Buller, Buller, Buller! We are thefamous Bullingdon Club, and we don’t give a fuck.’ Oh, yes, I bet Cameron,Osborne and Johnson feel your pain (Figs 551 and 552).[../Images/00116.jpg]Figure 551: Men of the people – David Cameron and Boris Johnson, theprofessional buffoon, pose in Bullingdon garb.[../Images/00114.jpg]Figure 552: George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer imposing austerityon the population, with his friend Nathan Rothschild.World War IIIThe Archontic Brave New World was well portrayed in the 2002 movie, Equilibrium.This included the theme of enforced medication to suppress the mind, emotionsand ability to feel empathy, and so turn everyone into pharmaceutically-inducedArchons. The population – and the police state suppressors in uniform – had totake medication every day and it was technologically-recorded if they had ornot. We are seeing the Totalitarian Tiptoe with regard to this with ediblemicrochips that tell your mobile phone when it is time for your medication andwith the financial incentives to label children with Attention Deficit Disorderand forcibly drug them. The German ARD television channel alleged in adocumentary that Rothschild Zionist Amazon was using neo-Nazi guards to controland intimidate more than 5,000 temporary staff from across Europe at Germanpacking and distribution centres. The programme showed operatives from HESSSecurity (believed to be named after Adolf Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess) wearingblack uniforms, boots and military haircuts, employed to police the workers athostels and budget hotels. Programme-makers said that ‘many were afraid’ andthey revealed photographic evidence of the guards regularly searching bedroomsand kitchens of foreign staff even frisking them and accosting some workers tosee if they had taken breakfast rolls. This is just a glimpse at what is planneduniformly. The Archontic world would be ruled by unelected bloodline bureaucratsand technocrats through a world government, central bank, global currency(electronic no cash), who dictate to a microchipped population. Power is beingconstantly centralised in all areas of human society to this end. Here you havethe real reason for the United Nations, European Union and its like, and forglobalisation, the World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, CodexAlimentarius, NATO, IMF, World Bank and European Central Bank and all the rest.The world Archontic government would own and control all the world’s resourcesincluding all food production and fresh water and, to achieve this, theArchontic networks have to acquire all the countries that currently have theresource reserves. This acquisition of resources, land and people is what thewars in North Africa and the Near and Middle East are really all about. Theexcuses for them cooked up in the shadows for the politicians to parrot are justthat – excuses. They want this sequence of wars to lead to a world war thatwould create a global Problem-Reaction-Solution, a worldwide conflict that wouldlead to a world government, central bank and army to ‘stop this ever happeningagain’. I have been saying since the 1990s that the plan is to bring the ‘West’into a conflict with Russia and China with the trigger in the Middle East – thelocation, in Israel, of the biblical ‘Armageddon’. The United States hasrecently spent hundreds of millions of dollars building underground andpartly-underground facilities in Israel with at least one of them going down sixlevels. All over the world are deep underground military bases (known as DUMBS)and whole cities in some cases and the same within mountains. There is alsostrong potential for US-China conflict in Africa with both working to seize itsland and resources. I have long said watch for the rise of China because that isa crucial element in the whole planned Archontic scenario. China is a base ofglobal importance for the Archons and their bloodlines. American Freemasonichero Albert Pike, the Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry in the 19thcentury and inspiration for the Ku Klux Klan, is famous for a letter that he issaid to have written in 1871 to Italian bloodline agent and Mafia founderGiuseppe Mazzini in which he outlined the three world wars that would lead toglobal domination. He uses the term ‘Illuminati’ for the Archontic networks:> The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to> overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a> fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by the ‘agentur’ of> the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment> this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to> destroy the other governments and in order to weaken the religions.> The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences> between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought> about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong> enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the> Second World War, International Communism must become strong enough in order> to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until> the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm.> The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences> caused by the ‘agentur’ of the ‘Illuminati’ between the political Zionists and> the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that> Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel)> mutually destroy each other.> Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be> constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and> economical exhaustion. We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we> shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show> clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and> of the most bloody turmoil.> Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world> minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of> civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose> deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious> for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive> the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of> Lucifer [the Demiurge], brought finally out in the public view. This> manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will> follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and> exterminated at the same time.People will say that there was no Zionism or Nazism in 1871, but they miss thepoint of how far ahead the agenda is planned and the detail with which humansociety is controlled and orchestrated. By 1871 those on the deep inside wouldhave well known what was planned for 1914, 1939 and present times. Pike was aFreemasonic associate of the bloodline asset Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) orPrince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg, who did much to advance the plan as thefirst Chancellor of a united Germany after the 1871 Treaty of Versailles. ThePike letter is quoted by Commander William Guy Carr, a former intelligenceofficer in the Royal Canadian Navy, in his book Satan: Prince of This World.Many say the letter was never written but when you read what it says about thecircumstances of the Third World War it fits perfectly with current events. TheArchontic families have underground cities to escape to while mayhem isunleashed on the surface which they intend to be nuclear in nature eventually.The Archontic networks have infested governments right across the political,religious and racial spectrum along with NATO and other agents of manipulation.They controlled Bill Clinton and Tony Blair who agreed to go to war; theycontrolled Boy Bush and Blair who agreed to go to war; and they control BarackObama and David Cameron who agreed to go to war along with the leadership ofFrance and other NATO countries. The US Republican Party is supposed to equateloosely with the British Conservative Party and the Democrats with the LabourParty, but while Clinton (Democrat) and Blair (Labour) went to war, so have Bush(Republican) and Blair (Labour) and Obama (Democrat) and Cameron (Conservative).Party labels don’t matter. What has changed since Rothschild Zionist NicolasSarkozy (‘Right’) was replaced by François Hollande (‘Left’) as president ofFrance? Nothing in terms of the wider agenda. Party names are only there to kidthe public they are different while all sides follow the same Archontic path totyranny. The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council whichdecides (at least officially) who can bomb whom are the United States, UnitedKingdom, France, China and Russia. These just happen to be major global playersin the Archontic networks. Why on earth should the United Kingdom with 63million people and France with 65 million have a permanent place on such apivotal body in a world of seven billion? See previous sentence for answer. TheAmerican military has, with shocking levels of Archontic arrogance, carved upthe world into a series of ‘COMS’ which are military commands designated tooperate in different regions (take them over). There is a CENTCOM, AFRICOM,EUCOM, PACOM, SOUTHCOM and NORTHCOM. The role of the last is the militarycontrol of domestic North America (Fig 553). The United States had troopsdeployed in more than 150 countries by 2013 and 35 were in Africa as theycontinued the process of battling with China to take over the continent and itsresources. The new warfare is through unmanned drone attacks and ever more arebeing continually deployed in Africa and the Middle and Near East with the USplanning a new drone base (and far from the last) in Niger near the border withMali. It was revealed in early 2013 that the US had been operating a secretdrone base in Saudi Arabia for two years. How many more are there that we don’tknow about? The ‘COMs’ are only temporary ‘American’ military designations. Whatwe are really seeing is the regional structure of the world army being put intoplace through the Totalitarian Tiptoe. National armies are being merged andbrought together in combat exercises (world army) and in joint operations (worldarmy) against engineered targets to expand the orgy of slaughter and acquisitionthat has followed 9/11. The staggering levels (trillions of dollars) of militaryspending by America at a time when it is $16 trillion in debt (projected toreach $20 trillion by 2016) and so many of its people are suffering sucheconomic hardship clearly shows that this money is not being spent for thebenefit of Americans. The American military is not actually the Americanmilitary at all. It is the Archon bloodline military paid for by Americantaxation and debt which is destroying the country. American wars overseas arenot to protect Americans, but to advance the Archon agenda for global conquestand the plan is for American military personnel, resources and infrastructure tobe transferred to a global command system when a world army is established.America has also been the hired gun to impose the will of the Archons across theworld in the incredible number of wars the country has been involved in since itdeclared independence in 1776. Put ‘American wars since 1776’ into a searchengine and you will see the enormity of the lie that constantly spews from themouths of its presidents and spokespeople that ‘America stands for peace,justice and freedom’. Once again, the Archons and their bloodlines invert andreverse everything and so those words really mean not ‘peace, justice andfreedom’ but ‘war, injustice and enslavement’. At the last the count the UnitedStates was either fighting, or supporting others in fighting, 74 different warsand conflicts and that is without all the covert operations they won’t admit to.Two of the US ‘COMS’ are CENTCOM which involves Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula andthe Middle and Near East, and AFRICOM which covers the whole of Africa exceptfor Egypt. These American (world army) ‘COMs’ are, together with Britain, Franceand the rest of NATO, behind the fake ‘Arab Spring’ that has torn asundercountry after country in precisely the target areas as Archontic politiciansparrot the excuses for the Archontic military to go in and cause the dominoes tofall (Fig 554). The Arab Spring is claimed to have started with Tunisia in 2011but by early 2013 the country had its first general strike in 35 years inprotest at the actions of the ‘new’ America/NATO-backed Islamic regime and theassassination of an opposition leader. The Arab Spring was a fairy-tale from dayone and Rothschild Zionist Google was heavily involved in manipulating events incountries like Egypt where one of the acclaimed ‘heroes’ who pump-primed thepropaganda that caused the masses to take to the streets was Google’s WaelGhonim. His page on Rothschild Zionist-owned Wikipedia describes how he becamean international figure and ‘energized prodemocracy demonstrations in Egyptafter his emotional interview following 11 days of secret incarceration byEgyptian police – during which he was interrogated regarding his work as theadministrator of the Facebook page, “We are all Khaled Saeed”, which helpedspark the revolution’. TIME magazine named him as one of the 100 mostinfluential people of 2011. Wael Ghonim was actually the head of marketing forGoogle Middle East and North Africa based in Dubai in the US-controlled UnitedArab Emirates.[../Images/00119.jpg]Figure 553: The world carved up by America (the Archon networks that controlAmerica).[../Images/00062.jpg]Figure 554: The ‘Arab Spring’ was long in the planning to subjugate North Africaand the Middle East.Caught red-handedThe London Daily Mail ran a story in January 2013 about leaked emails thatconfirmed plans for a chemical attack in Syria sanctioned by Washington thatwould be blamed on President Assad to justify a ‘humanitarian’ invasion of thecountry. The report was quickly removed from the Mail website, but you can see acaptured image of the posting in Figure 555. What the story described was aclassic Problem-Reaction-Solution. The report revealed details of allegedlyhacked emails from the British and Dubai-based defence contractor Britam Defencerevealing a plan ‘approved by Washington’ and organised through the Americanclient state of Qatar to transport a chemical weapon (CW) to Syria that wasclearly intended to be a Problem-Reaction-Solution to remove the Assad regime asthey had been so desperate to do for so long. Obama had said that a chemicalattack by Assad would be the ‘red line’ that would trigger military interventionand the on-the-team French President Francois Hollande followed suit. He agreedthat the use of chemical weapons would be ‘a legitimate reason for directintervention’. Israel naturally said something similar – any excuse for a war.The emails were revealed by a German hacker and were alleged to becorrespondence between David Goulding, the Britam Defence Business DevelopmentDirector, and Philip Doughty, the company’s founder. This was the exchange:[../Images/00179.jpg]Figure 555: The Mail story – now you see it, now you don’t.> Phil> We’ve got a new offer. It’s about Syria again. Qataris propose an attractive> deal and swear that the idea is approved by Washington.> We’ll have to deliver a CW to Homs, a Soviet origin g-shell from Libya similar> to those that Assad should have. They want us to deploy our Ukrainian> personnel that should speak Russian and make a video record.> Frankly, I don’t think it’s a good idea but the sums proposed are enormous.> Your opinion?> Kind regards> DavidWhy would ‘the Qataris’, in other words US puppet Emir Sheikh Hamad bin KhalifaAl Thani, the conduit for funding and arming the ‘rebels’ in Syria and Libya,want to pay enormous sums for a chemical weapon to be delivered to Homs inSyria, one of the centres of ‘rebel’ operations? There can be only one reasonwhen it was obviously not for the Assad regime and note how the brief was toproduce a weapon ‘similar to those that Assad should have’. Britam admitted thatits computer system had been hacked but denied that the emails were genuine. Idon’t believe them. An alleged software systems administrator who said he hadchecked the technical details of how the Britam email was routed said: ‘I haveto admit that the email does indeed look genuine ... all these facts check out.So with Mythbusters objectivity I have to call this one plausible.’ Other leakeddocuments included what was described as ‘extremely personal information’ anddetails of some Britam employees that appeared to show they were mercenaries.The United States, Britain and NATO work with a whole web of ‘private defencecontractors’ who are nothing more than extensions of the military under othernames – the infamous Halliburton, once headed by Dick Cheney, and Blackwater,later called Xe and now Academi, are the best-known, but there are so manyothers. Blackwater keeps changing its name to cover the tracks of its infamy. Asactor Kenneth Williams said in a Carry On film: ‘Infamy, infamy, they’ve all gotit infamy.’ The Western media ignored the Britam email story apart from thatDaily Mail report which was quickly removed. A false-flag chemical weaponsattack had been on the cards for a while and you can get a good idea about whatis planned by listening to the ‘red lines’ these people announce. They say thatif their target does this or that it will justify a military attack and then youjust get someone else go and do this or that. Those that hacked the emails madeit very much more difficult to get away with it in Syria and that’s why themainstream media wouldn’t touch the story. This is all related to what GeneralWesley Clark said in the television interview in 2007 about the Pentagonplanning to attack and destroy the governments in seven countries in five years– Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran. Remember Clark wasdescribing a plan hatched during the Republican administration of Boy Bush andyet exactly the same plan targeting the same listed countries has continuedunder ‘Democrat’ Obama in America’s one-party state (Fig 556). You just knewthat eventually the claim would be made that Assad had used chemical weaponsagainst civilians because these people are nothing if not predictable. The claimbased on ‘evidence’ supplied by, yes, Britain and France, was duly made in thehope of justifying what they are aching to do; but then came an interview withCarla del Ponte, a member of a UN panel investigating in Syria, in which shesaid there were ‘strong, concrete suspicions’ that the Syrian rebels had usedsarin nerve gas. ‘This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not bythe government authorities’, she told Swiss-Italian TV. A CNN report in December2012 revealed how the Pentagon was training Syrian rebels in the use of chemicalweapons. It said:[../Images/00024.jpg]Figure 556: The wish list during the Bush administration has been continued byhis ‘opponent’ Obama.> The training [in chemical weapons], which is taking place in Jordan and> Turkey, involves how to monitor and secure stockpiles and handle weapons sites> and materials, according to the sources. Some of the contractors are on the> ground in Syria working with the rebels to monitor some of the sites,> according to one of the officials. The nationality of the trainers was not> disclosed, though the officials cautioned against assuming all are American.White House spokesman (propagandist) Jay Carney said they were ‘highly scepticalof any suggestions that the opposition used chemical weapons’ and they believedthat Assad was responsible. True to form the US announced again in June, 2013(with no evidence) that Assad had used chemical weapons and Obama said that theywould now supply weapons to the ‘rebels’ (officially and in greater number, thatis, rather than covertly as up to that point). At the same time the EuropeanUnion dropped its ban on weapons supplies to the ‘rebels’ with Britain leadingthe way. All this happened as Assad troops were retaking locations held by the‘rebels’ and the Archontic plan was going pear-shaped. Another point: why wouldAssad even think of using chemical weapons when he knew that it would give hisglobal enemies just the excuse they wanted to destroy him? He would be crazy –and he isn’t. Israel launched bomb attacks on Syria in May, 2013 in the hopethat the Syrian army would be weakened and seeking a Syrian retaliation thatcould lead to all-out war. This was reported as a unilateral attack by thepsychopaths of Tel Aviv, but it would have been sanctioned behind the scenes bythe usual suspects – the US, Britain, Canada and NATO in general. Obamaconfirmed as much after the attacks when he said that the US ‘coordinatesclosely’ with Israel. Israeli planes bombed locations around the Syrian capitalDamascus in their second attack in three days and claimed to have destroyedstockpiles of Iranian-made guided missiles intended for the Lebanese militantgroup Hezbollah. They produced no evidence of this and Lebanon is another targeton the must-have list.Syria is not a war caused by ‘rebels’ within the country just as the Libyan‘revolution’ was not. They are part of a systematic fake ‘Arab Spring’ takeoverof the whole of Africa and the Middle and Near East by forces working throughthe United States, Israel and NATO (all the same thing if you go high enough ordeep enough). I have been exposing this agenda in my books for years and themilitary intervention in Mali was only one example of what is planned forcountry after country in Africa, orchestrated through the US AFRICOM network inleague with NATO countries. Watch out South Africa because they want you, too.They want everything because they are insane. The French action in Mali was onlythe French arm of the Archon networks serving the global agenda and seeking tosecure abundant natural resources including gold and uranium reserves. Inanother you-couldn’t-make-it-up moment the Archontic French President FrancoisHollande, who sent in the troops, was given a UNESCO peace prize for his‘valuable contribution to peace and stability in Africa’ by going to war, makingthousands of Malians homeless and, according to Amnesty International, imposing‘serious human rights breaches’ including the killing of children. Inversion,inversion, inversion. The Archon networks usually manufacture a different excusefor each new country although with Libya and Syria it was exactly the same.‘Rebels’ funded and armed by the US and NATO (via Qatar, Turkey and SaudiArabia) start attacking government targets and when the government returns firethe forces behind the ‘rebels’ scream through their compliant and ignorant media‘Gaddafi/Assad is killing his own people’. They then use this ‘humanitarian’excuse to send the boys in to slaughter the innocent and steal oil reserves andother assets. They did this in Libya and they have been desperate to do this inSyria but it has not been as easy as they thought and so they planned tocovertly arrange a chemical attack to say ‘we have to send in NATO to stop Assadkilling his own people with chemical weapons’. No wonder the Daily Mail articlewas removed so quickly. When their game is exposed they lose their coverstories. Conspiracies are so often dismissed in real time only to be confirmedwith hindsight, but at the very moment a past conspiracy is being acknowledgedany claims to real time conspiracies go on being dismissed. This isschizophrenic doublethink yet again. It is now officially confirmed that whenEgypt’s President Nasser seized and nationalised the Suez Canal in 1956 therewas a conspiracy between Israel, Britain and France to take it back. Theagreement, called the Protocol of Sèvres, was that Israel would invade Egypt andthen Britain and France would say that if the fighting didn’t stop they wouldsend troops to ‘save the canal’. This is precisely what happened, but anyoneexposing the collusion at the time would have been called a loony conspiracytheorist. By the way, as the Israeli troops were withdrawing from Egypt afterthe ceasefire they destroyed roads, railways, telephone lines and the villagesof Abu Ageila and El Quseima, and stole six railway locomotives. Oh, justanother day in Tel Aviv then.[../Images/00359.jpg]Figure 557: Arch manipulator Brzezinski.Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Archontic asset and co-founder of the TrilateralCommission with David Rockefeller, admitted in a French magazine interview thatwhen he was Jimmy Carter’s National Security Advisor from 1977 to 1981 he hadtrained and armed Afghan ‘rebels’ to fight the then Soviet-satellite regime inthe capital Kabul to give the Soviet Union ‘their Vietnam’ (Fig 557). This wasdone in collusion with Britain’s MI6 and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence(ISI) which had close connections to 9/11 ‘terrorist leader’ Mohamed Atta, a manwho was such an Islamic fanatic that he had an American girlfriend, tookcocaine, drank heavily and his favourite food was pork. Brzezinski’s plan was tomake the Soviets invade to protect their Afghan satellite and then bog them downin a war they couldn’t win. The Brzezinski armed and trained Afghan ‘rebels’later became known as the Mujahedeen/Taliban/‘Al-Qaeda’. During theReagan-Father Bush regime that followed Carter’s, US Intelligence arranged for aman called Osama bin Laden to travel from Saudi Arabia to lead the Mujahedeen inthe long and bloody war with the Soviets. The Bin Laden family were friends andassociates of the Bush family, especially Father Bush, but when Boy Bush was inthe White House at the time of 9/11 the former CIA asset Bin Laden was used asthe fake villain and the Taliban-Mujahedeen demonised to justify the USinvasion. There is no contradiction in this because there is a common theme –whatever is best for the Archontic agenda at the time. It suited the Archonfamilies for Bin Laden and the Mujahedeen to be heroes when they were fightingthe Soviet Union through the 1980s after the Soviets invaded to shore up theirregime in Kabul; but then it suited them after 9/11 to cast them as demons thatAmerican forces had to be despatched to trounce in the ‘war on terror’ (Fig558). In the same way, the ‘war on terror’ was supposed to wage war against‘Islamic terrorists’ and ‘Al-Qaeda’, but the ‘rebels’ in Libya and Syria werelargely ‘Al-Qaeda’ fighting in the interests of the US-NATO campaign of terrorand conquest together with the Muslim Brotherhood. This is the same ‘Al-Qaeda’(‘The Database’) which only really existed in any significant form after 9/11because its recruits believed in its existence as a result of the Americanssaying it existed! Even now it is more a name than a structure and exists toserve the interests of the Archon bloodlines even though virtually none of themwill know that. When ‘Al-Qaeda’ (Western-backed terrorists) gained access toLibya’s arms stockpile, including chemical weapons, they then had the chance toarm similar groups all over Africa and the Middle East which is just what theArchon families wanted to cause death, destruction and mayhem. A sickeningexample of the mentality involved is the Syrian ‘rebel’ Abu Sakkar who wascaught on video cutting out the heart of a dead soldier, taking a bite andsaying: ‘I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers ofBashar the dog’. These are the sort of insane people that the US, Britain andNATO are arming and funding. Once Gaddafi was dead and Libya was secured for thecabal many of the ‘Libyan rebels’ (mercenaries) just headed for Syria to do thesame there. The leading ‘rebel’ group fighting the Assad regime in Syria is AlNusra, an ‘Al- Qaeda’ offshoot to which nearly 30 US/NATO-supported ‘rebel’groups in Syria pledged allegiance. The Muslim Brotherhood which is takingofficial control of countries vanquished by fake revolution and military attackhas been a front for America, Britain and Israel for decades, as I explained inRemember Who You Are. The Brotherhood can also be used to stir up fears of anIslamic takeover when they are just stooges of the very forces saying that.*They are a bunch of frauds. Many of the other people cast as Islamic terroriststo justify military intervention are actually people fighting to retain theirlands from the Archontic locusts. The term ‘terrorists’ is just a label todemonise people when it suits, and to be ditched when it doesn’t. This techniquewas plain to see when the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) which has beenresponsible for the deaths of thousands in Iran was removed from the USGovernment list of terrorist organisations ... because it commits terrorismagainst the US target regime in Iran. Major General Amos Yadlin, former head ofIsrael Military Intelligence and military attaché to Washington, called inFebruary 2013 for Israel to cement closer ties with al-Qaeda-linked ‘rebels’(terrorists) in Syria for a united assault on ‘the big enemy, which is Iran’. Ihave highlighted in other books how the divisions between Sunni and ShiiteMuslims (the division stems from some irrelevant disagreement long, long ago)were being exploited by Israel and the West to divide and rule the Arab worldand set it at war with itself. This is what Yadlin was talking about here whenhe said that ties should be strengthened with Sunni forces for a joint attack onShiite Iran. Eric Draister, founder of stopimperialism.com, was right when hesaid that Israel and al-Qaeda are ‘two sides of the same coin’ creatinginstability and provoking violence in Syria: ‘Israel and al-Qaeda are two sidesof the US-dominated imperial system which has waged war on the independentnation of Syria attempting to destroy that country.’ Major General Yadlin saidthat the ongoing destructive violence in Syria had brought about strategicbenefit for Israel. But, of course – that is why it happened. The leader of theforeignbacked Syrian opposition, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, an engineer and managerfor major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell’s Syrian division, pledgedallegiance to the Israeli regime if Assad is overthrown. Israel took advantageof the violence and chaos in Syria to give a US energy company a license for oilexploration in the Syrian Golan Heights which Israel has illegally occupiedsince the Six Day War in 1967. Israeli political analyst Yaron Ezrahi said thatthis was ‘mostly an Israeli ploy to deepen its commitment to the occupied GolanHeights’. Israel has no intention of returning occupied land – only even furtherexpansion (Fig 559).[../Images/00245.jpg]Figure 558: The Hidden hand of the ‘Arab Spring’.[../Images/00218.jpg]Figure 559: The snake in the sand.The Soros Doctrine (being cruel to be ... crueller)Readers of my previous books will be well aware of the heinous activities of thebillionaire financier George Soros (Rothschild Zionist) who has become mega-richby being a bagman for the Rothschilds. His real name is George Schwartz and hehelped to confiscate the possessions of fellow Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungarywhile posing as a non-Jew. He has also worked tirelessly for decades for hisRothschild masters to advance the Archontic plan and part humans from theirmoney. They call Soros a financial speculator, but since when does the word‘speculate’ relate to someone who knows what is coming and bets beforehand thatit will happen? He has a maze of ‘trusts’ and foundations that specialise in,among other things, training people in the art of civil rebellion. Not rebellionagainst the Archontic Cabal, however, or they would rebel against Soros. No, no.Soros ‘rebellions’ are against Archon targets to bring about a ‘people’srevolution’ which, when all is done and dusted, has the Archon bloodlines incontrol of the country with their selected frontman or woman of choice. The‘Arab Spring’, especially the early stages, was a Soros production (Fig 560). Ihave exposed in detail the Soros rebel-training web in concert with people likeBrzezinski in Remember Who You Are and his funding of ‘think-tanks’ like theCenter for American Progress (inversion) to direct the policies of theDemocratic Party for which he is a Democon. He has also been a puppet-master toObama along with Rahm Emanuel (Rothschild Zionist) and David Axelrod (RothschildZionist). Brzezinski has been an Obama mentor for decades. But I want tohighlight here the Soros manipulation of the ‘humanitarian’ excuse to invadecountry after country. This began publicly with a Soros article in 2004 entitled‘The People’s Sovereignty’, published in the magazine Foreign Policy owned bythe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace which was exposed by the ReeceCommittee investigation into tax-exempt foundations to be manipulating war.Soros’ theme and aim was to replace the government of a country as a definitionof sovereignty with the population of the country as the sovereignty. This maysound okay unless you know the context. Up to this point to attack a country wassaid to be an invasion of sovereignty if the government did not want to beattacked and why would it? The Soros scam was to have sovereignty redefined asthe population and then you could invade a country on the basis that the targetgovernment was violating the ‘people’s sovereignty’. See ‘he’s killing his ownpeople’. This was the scoundrel’s punch-line in the Foreign Policy article:[../Images/00061.jpg]Figure 560: Arab Spring – The Movie> But true sovereignty belongs to the people, who in turn delegate it to their> governments. If governments abuse the authority entrusted to them and citizens> have no opportunity to correct such abuses, outside interference is justified.> By specifying that sovereignty is based on the people, the international> community can penetrate nation-states’ borders to protect the rights of> citizens.> In particular, the principle of the people’s sovereignty can help solve two> modern challenges: the obstacles to delivering aid effectively to sovereign> states, and the obstacles to global collective action dealing with states> experiencing internal conflict.Remember this was in 2004 well before the planned ‘Arab Spring’ that Soros knewwas coming because his network was at the forefront of making it happen.Triggering rebellion is easy with so many tyrants in power waiting to bereplaced by new tyrants with the population in the middle manipulated intounknowing and essential participation in what most of them think until realitydawns is a glorious revolution of freedom and change for the better. Thisredefinition of sovereignty is presented with the Soros doctrine of‘responsibility to protect’:> ... the rulers of a sovereign state have a responsibility to protect the> state’s citizens. When they fail to do so, the responsibility is transferred> to the international community. Global attention is often the only lifeline> available to the oppressed.Yes, Soros cares so much about the oppressed. Only by being an emotionlessgenetic inverter is it possible to be so mendacious without a smear ofconscience. Soros had outlined the takeover tactics:> • You decree that the people represent sovereignty and that governments have a> responsibility to protect the sovereign population.> • If they don’t do this, or your propaganda makes it look that way, there is> an automatic transfer of power from the country to the ‘International> community’ (Archon network).> • You cue your armed, funded and trained rebels to attack the target regime,> wait for the regime to respond – ‘he’s killing his own people’ – and say the> regime has failed in its responsibility to protect.> • The International Community send in the military to protect the people (by> bombing them shitless, as in Libya, and taking over their land and resources).Soros and company don’t want sovereignty for anyone except themselves and aworld government. He said: ‘Sovereignty is an anachronistic concept originatingin bygone times when society consisted of rulers and subjects, not citizens.’What do you have to do to bring about world government? Destroy nationalsovereignty. See the EU. What Soros wrote and called for in 2004 is now globalpolicy adopted by the United Nations’ Security Council and General Assembly in2005. The way was opened for the Arab Spring and the international militaryintervention that has followed. Meanwhile, countries in North America and Europecan do what they like to their ‘people’ without any chance whatsoever ofintervention by the ‘International Community’ (world government). Why? They arethe ‘International Community’.Crazy is the new normalThe control of global politics by mad people has created the madness we call theworld. I had a personal experience of system insanity when the Japanese videogame giant, Sega, blocked the use of an anti-war song at my Wembley Arena eventin October 2012 that I wanted to play during a call for people to stop killingeach other. This ban was not about money because the financial deal had beenagreed and the final paperwork was about to be exchanged. It was apparentlystopped by the ‘brand manager’ of a game series called, wait for it ... TotalWar. The reason for this decision was nothing more than personal bias andprejudice because Sega told us that they did not want ‘their’ music associatedwith a ‘controversial figure’ like me. Or the ‘brand manager’ didn’t. When itcomes to crazy, inexplicable and bizarre, the very fact that the originalwriters of a great anti-war song could sell the rights to a multinationalcorporation for use in a video game series called Total War takes some seriousbeating; but maybe that can be eclipsed by the about-faced bizarreness of therights holder using this anti-war song in a video game in which war is sold asentertainment while banning the use of the song to call for peace andreconciliation at an event which thousands were attending. And if you want towalk the extremes of bizarreness and Orwellian doublethink, imagine if theperson banning the use of the song in its true context considers the requester‘controversial’ while presumably considering himself non-controversial, sane andcredible for producing and promoting video games in which simulated mass-murderis presented as a bit of fun and a way to enjoy your free time. But then waritself has become a video game with mindless and moronic uniforms and ‘yessirs’killing thousands of people in the Middle and Near East in remotely-controlleddrone strikes while sitting at their consoles, joysticks in hand, on the otherside of the world – just like the kid in his bedroom playing Total War.Hey, kid, you play Total War?‘Sure do.’‘You good at it?’‘Yes sir, got to level one.’‘You wanna job?’I hadn’t focussed much on video games before but what happened prompted me tohave a closer look. My goodness. One YouTube posting exclaimed: ‘A 30,800 menbattle in Total War!’ Hey, brilliant. Lots of simulated dead people at nineminutes in. What fun. And this stuff does not affect the minds and perceptionsof the young and others playing it hour after hour with regard to theirattitudes to war and violence? The world is mad: it’s official. And Total. Ittook me a matter of minutes to find the following comments by Total War playerson a dedicated forum (grammar not corrected):> Love shooting up peasants with archers.. love the noise as the arrows hit the> men and you see the blood splatter and some of them die.

There is no way in the worldthat constantly killing in simulated war with the player having the power todominate and kill does not influence perceptions of life and death, war andpeace. Not with everyone, maybe (though probably), but at least with a verylarge number and this is all part of the brutalisation of the human mind toimplant cold, callous emotionless Archontic perceptions. Look at the samementality when military drone ‘pilots’ kill people they have never met and knownothing about by targeting them on the equivalent of a computer game screen inthe cockpit and then ‘elimnate’ them, as the misspelt forum post talks about(Fig 561). You can see a picture in Figure 562 of a real-life video war gameplayed by the US military in Iraq with real weapons and real people and usingthe same language you would hear from kids playing Total War. The troops saybefore killing innocent people on the ground – ‘Light ‘em all up. Come on,fire!’ and ‘Look at those dead bastards’. This is what war is today to such alarge and gathering extent. It is a video game with simulation and realityincreasingly blurred in the perception of the players whether it be fantasy orvery real. Body-Mind cannot detect the difference between real and fantasy inthe sense that thinking about something or experiencing a simulation can triggerthe same mental, emotional and physical responses as if it were reallyhappening. So it must be with video war games and other forms of video violence,especially the more you play them. Seventy-two percent of Xbox game owners saidin a 2012 US election poll that they supported more drone strikes on ‘suspectedterrorists’ (men, women and children). One video game blog ran the headline‘Xbox 360 Owners Sure Do Love Drone Strikes’. I wonder why. The poll wasconducted in conjunction with polling organisation YouGov to establish, intruth, if the programming was working. The head Xbox pollster was DavidRothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research New York City. A toy company isalso producing killer drones for children to play with when they are not usingtheir Xbox. How helpful. Enormous numbers of children, young people and adultsare gripped by this new epidemic of video addiction in which the body demandsits constant fix of emotional chemicals produced by the response to playing thegames. The global population has long been systematically desensitised to warand its horrors and the video game producers are just the next major phase ofthis. The Rockefeller insider who told a meeting of paediatricians inPennsylvania in 1969 about the cure for cancer being found and suppressed alsosaid that the plan was that ‘violence, pornography and obscenity in the mediaand movies would be increased to desensitise people to violence and porn [andto] make people feel that life is short, precarious and brutish.’ Violent videogames in which the player can choose to be violent and merciless are a new levelof the mind and perception programming that includes television and movies inwhich the violence can only be watched and not participated in or instigated. Inthat sense, violent video games are a further step along this dark and dangerousroad. When set within this context, the decision to block the use of an anti-warsong in an anti-war context while using the same lyrics for ‘wage war’ videogames can be seen to take place within a society suffering from extreme levelsof what Orwell called doublethink.[../Images/00331.jpg]Figure 561: No words necessary.[../Images/00336.jpg]Figure 562: The mentally ill play computer games.Political schizophrenicsIt is the schizophrenia which makes it all possible. Such doublethinking,double-minds can easily equate someone challenging the madness as‘controversial’, even ‘crazy’, while they daily promote insane objectives andbelieve themselves to be completely balanced and ‘normal’. The communalschizophrenia allows the perpetrators and believers of the madness tocompartmentalise their minds, and thus their actions, by ensuring that thedifferent parts of the mind involved in utterly contradictory behaviour simplyavoid acknowledging each other’s existence. This means that there can never beany reassessment of self and behaviour. For example, drone pilots sitting atvideo screens at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada can take their own childrento school in the morning and then head for work to kill other children thousandsof miles away who they have never met and know nothing about. American authorJames Bamford, who has written extensively about US Intelligence, said:> Death warrants for targets are signed by mid-level bureaucrats, and soccer> moms and dads double as joystick killers. They operate in comfort and safety,> half the Earth away from their targets and close enough for many to run home> for lunch between kills.Only shocking levels of desensitised schizophrenia can explain this – apart frompsychopathy – but then that is something similar anyway. Talking of which ...Barack Obama and the rest of the global political establishment. There are otherforms of mental illness that do not involve schizophrenia and in many ways theseare even more extreme. I am speaking of those, like Barack Obama, who are nothiding themselves from another part of themselves, but know they are lying whenthey lie and know they are being hypocrites when they are being hypocritical.They just couldn’t care less. Obama’s speech at the United Nations in 2012 was awonderful example in that this mass killer and war criminal had the nerve tocondemn others for violent extremism for either doing nothing or a fraction ofwhat Obama sanctions in a month:> It is time to marginalise those who – even when not resorting to violence –> use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel as a central principle of> politics. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must> do together: educating our children and creating the opportunities they> deserve; protecting human rights and extending democracy’s promise.It was like ‘Evita’ singing Argentina. You say what suits your interests in themoment knowing that it’s all bullshit. Obama’s aversion and distain for truthmeans that he can high-horse his way through a written-for-him Teleprompterspeech condemning violence after signing off his latestkill-without-charge-or-trial list, agreeing to more deadly drone strikes againstthe innocent and generally overseeing the mass murder of people with brownfaces. This is how far we have now come along the road to global tyranny withObama now being presented with a list of people that the military-intelligencecommunity want to kill with unmanned drones and the alleged president signinghis name on the death warrants. They then give the order for the computer-gamedrone operators to seek out and murder those on the list without any evidencebeing produced against them, no charges, no trial. Nothing. The military say wewant to take these people out and Obama says okay (Fig 563). Britain is involvedin this drone war, too. The cold-blooded murder of anyone is disgusting enough,but they have killed thousands of civilians who are neither on the list nor haveharmed anyone. This is happening all the time and goes largely unreported. YetObama claims his administration is the most transparent and ethical in thehistory of the United States (inversion). He said this while opposing a Freedomof Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit that would make him reveal the alleged legalbasis for killing people without charge or trial. The outgoing Defense SecretaryLeon Panetta took madness to a whole new level in 2013 when he announced a newDistinguished Warfare Medal for drone operators sitting at computer consoleskilling the innocent thousands of miles away. This medal is literally for beinggood at targeting computer technology to kill people – like a medal for gettingto the top level of a video game. At the same time people peacefully protestingoutside drone bases against the murder of the innocent are arrested. This isstill more Archon inversion. Plans for the medal were later dropped thankgoodness in face of opposition. How appropriate that either side of Barack Obamaas he makes his State of the Union address every year are the symbols of powerknown as the fasces – the word from which we get the term fascism (Fig 564).This could not be more appropriate given the agenda of those that control thisprofessional liar and fraud and virtually all of those he has followed in theWhite House. The word fasces comes from the Latin fascis or ‘bundle’ and it wasthe power symbol in ancient Rome although it goes back further (Fig 565). Theywere often decorated with laurel leaves and once again we see this behind Obama.The laurel is another major bloodline symbol and we see it on the logo of thecabal-controlled United Nations. The axe head on the fasces symboliseddictatorship and the magisterial power to impose capital punishment. The rodstied together represent individuality (people and countries) enslaved as onecollective unit ruled by a dictatorship – the axe head. I have just describedthe European Union with its structure that mirrors the fascist symbol. Now whywould the ‘Land of the Free’ have the symbol of fascism, the symbol from whichthe very term came, at such a prime location in its alleged ‘democracy’ (orrepublic as it was supposed to be)? And why can the same symbol be found in thefollowing places, among many others?: the Oval Office; the Mace of the UnitedStates House of Representatives; the official seal of the United States Senate(Fig 566); the base of the Statue of Freedom on top of the Capitol building; thefacade of the United States Supreme Court building; the Lincoln Memorial; eitherside of the bust of Lincoln commemorating his Gettysburg Address inPennsylvania; the interior of the Washington Monument; the statue of GeorgeWashington at the site of his inauguration, now the Federal Hall NationalMemorial; the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (Fig 567); theofficial seal of the United States Tax Court; the seal of the National GuardBureau; US Army Military Police heraldry; the Grand Army Plaza, New York; theseal of Brooklyn; the state seal of Colorado beneath the ‘All-seeing eye’; theemblem of the Knights of Columbus. Why? Because America is a fascist statemasquerading as ‘freedom’. It is the new Rome, and Washington DC is built onland that was called Rome and the location dictated by the Roman Church.Britain, Australia and the European Union etc., are also fascist entities in(ever-diminishing) disguise. All the rest is window dressing, cover up andillusion.[../Images/00415.jpg]Figure 563: ‘They think I want peace ... ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ...[../Images/00298.jpg]Figure 564: The fascist symbol and there are also two behind him.[../Images/00350.jpg]Figure 565: The Roman symbol that led to the term ‘fascism’.[../Images/00260.jpg]Figure 566: Fascism in the Senate.[../Images/00079.jpg]Figure 567: Fascism in the courts.The man handing Obama the drone death list has been the necessarily cold andheartless John Brennan who was until early 2013 his ‘chief of counterterrorism’.Brennan supported torture by the Bush administration and Obama wanted him forCIA Director during his first term. Brennan’s views on torture would have madethe nomination process very messy for the new man of peace and love in the WhiteHouse so he made Brennan his Deputy National Security Advisor which didn’trequire Senate hearing approval. But in 2013 with the Obama mask now back in thedraw at the start of his second term Brennan was made Director of the CIA and nodoubt torture and drone attacks will subsequently soar. Brennan appeared beforethe Senate Intelligence Committee for his confirmation hearing in early 2013.The Committee is chaired by Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein (Rothschild Zionist)who not only speaks with two tongues but two faces. One face/tongue demands thedisarming of Americans because of the Sandy Hook incident (with its countlessunanswered questions) and the other seeks to justify killing children andfamilies in drone attacks by outrageously misrepresenting the figures. Butobviously killing children and their families from the air thousands of milesaway is not the same as in America – I mean, they’re brown people aren’t theyand oppose the agenda of Israel? Protestors at Brennan’s hearing were met withFeinstein’s cold arrogance and dismissal – she does cold well. Keep serving yourmasters, Feinstein, you know it makes sense. Feinstein insisted that civiliandeaths from US covert strikes each year has ‘typically been in the singledigits’, but she produces no evidence to support that. She also said that ‘forthe past several years, this committee has done significant oversight of thegovernment’s conduct of targeted strikes’ and had done its ‘utmost to confirm’civilian casualty data provided by the executive branch. The Bureau forInvestigative Journalism checked out this statement and said it could find noindication that either the House or Senate Intelligence committees had tried tosecure evidence for civilian drone casualties outside of the US Intelligencecommunity. The major independent groups investigating civilian deaths from droneattacks said they had not been contacted. You mean Rothschild Zionist Feinsteinis not telling the truth? Really? As I write, America is at war with morecountries and regimes than at any time since 1945 with drone attacks targeting‘terrorists’ (civilians) in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and elsewherewith more to come. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced in February2013 that the Obama administration will not be releasing any more informationabout using drones to kill American citizens. ‘I say, cleaning person, I am justlifting the carpet – will you grab a brush?’ Virginia E Sloan, president of theConstitution Project, summed up the situation: ‘We have this drone war, and theAmerican public has no idea what the rules are, and Congress doesn’t know muchmore.’ It’s called a tyrannical dictatorship, Virginia.The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) signed into law by Obama in 2012makes it legal for the United States military to arrest or use force against anyperson (including American citizens) that the state says it suspects ofterrorism and hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location withoutevidence, charge, lawyer or trial. No, this is not a conspiracy theory. It isAmerican law. Now. A ‘terrorist suspect’ in this context is someone who isalleged to have ‘substantially supported’ certain terrorist groups andassociated forces, but none of this is defined and the coach-and-horsesvagueness means that they can basically say and do whatever they like. SenatorLindsey Graham, a man with the brain power of a tumble drier, said of thisfascist provision: ‘When they say I want a lawyer tell them to shut up – youdon’t get a lawyer.’ This is a man who swore to uphold the Constitution as parthis oath of office and yet can say this and not be fired. But why would he be?He might not be serving freedom, decency, fairness or justice, but in not doingso he is serving those who put him in office and keep him there. It is the fewdecent politicians that get fired. Obama sanctioned the murder without trial orevidence of American citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan in drone attacks inYemen. They also killed al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son Abdulrahman, an Americancitizen, ‘by mistake’ in a drone attack two weeks after his father died. RobertGibbs, an Obama senior adviser and former White House Press Secretary, was askedto justify the killing of an American citizen, a minor, without due process,trial or even being accused of anything. The Archontic Gibbs replied: ‘I wouldsuggest that you should have a far more responsible father if they are trulyconcerned about the well-being of their children. I don’t think becoming anal-Qaeda jihadist terrorist is the best way to go about doing your business.’First of all you don’t kill a son because of the father; second the boy waskilled two weeks after his father’s death; and thirdly how much inhumanity(Archons are by definition inhuman) can you have and still find it possible todraw breath? The US Justice [inversion] Department published a 16-page report inFebruary 2013 outrageously and ridiculously seeking to justify drone murderwithout evidence, charge or trial. It said the government can order the killingof American citizens if they are believed to be ‘senior operational leaders’ ofal-Qaeda or ‘an associated force’ (innocent civilians) – even if there is nointelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the US.Obama’s White House Press Secretary, the professional liar Jay Carney, said:‘These strikes are legal, they are ethical and they are wise.’ Like I say, crazyis the new normal, the new status quo, and the US president in the Land of theFree is a legalised mass murderer. House Minority Leader, the truly ludicrousRothschild Zionist arse-licker Nancy Pelosi, said that Obama doesn’t‘necessarily’ have to reveal that an American citizen suspected of terrorism hasbeen killed in a drone strike and CIA Director John Brennan refused to rule outdrone assassinations of Americans on US soil. This is the world in which we arenow living, but most people are still oblivious of that. Even most of those whoknow about the killer drone assassination programme are not aware of the ‘nightraids’ operated by the Joint Special Operations Command when trained psychopathsin uniform kick down doors and kill people with no questions asked on the say soof ‘informants’ who often name people they don’t like as terrorists to have themtaken out. So many innocent people have been murdered in this way by the USmilitary.US Attorney General Eric Holder is a man you can trust with your lif ... er ...your freed ... er, well, there must be something you can trust him with, surely?I mean, does he ever take a list down the store and come back with everythingyou asked for? Come on, I need some help here. Anyway, Holder said: ‘It ispossible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it wouldbe necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of theUnited States for the president to authorize the military to use lethal forcewithin the territory of the United States.’ Holder knows what is going on and assuch that statement is outrageously disingenuous. ‘It is possible’ means ‘it isplanned’. The British Government has in at least two cases revoked the passportsand citizenship of British citizens living in drone strike areas immediatelybefore they were killed by US drone attacks. It avoids the controversy ofAmerica killing British ‘subjects’. Opinion poll research revealed the scale ofObama groupie programming which has destroyed the anti-war movement that grewunder Boy Bush. Obama can do the same or worse and there is not a whimper fromthose frauds who put their banners in the shed and locked the door behind them.Opposing war is for life, not for a presidential term. An opinion poll revealedthat only 27 percent of white liberals in a control group supported the dronetargeted murder policy, but that became 48 percent when they were told thatObama was doing it. The result was much the same with African-Americans and itwas dubbed the ‘Obama cue’. A few people can’t control the world? Investigativejournalist Jeremy Scahill, author of Dirty Wars: The World Is a Battlefield, wasright when he said ‘one of the enduring legacies of the Obama administration isthat he has normalised assassination as a central component of ... nationalsecurity policy.’ Obama was portrayed as being against war when he clearlywasn’t, but this was the image that was promoted. He was going to be theantidote for Boy Bush, we were told, but he is also justifying his state murdersand surveillance by quoting the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Act(AUMF) which was passed in the Bush era three days after the 9/11 attacks. Eventhe New York Times has called the repeal of this Act because it has ‘become thebasis for a perpetual, ever-expanding war that undermined the traditionalconstraints on government power’ and results in ‘an unintelligible policywithout express limits or protective walls’. How can Obama be so corrupt as touse a law instigated by the Bush Administration that he so condemned? It’s all agame to bluff the public while they both serve the same force. Note the use ofthe term ‘perpetual war’ which is straight off the pages of Orwell’s 1984.President Boy Bush also changed the law to allow presidents to ‘legally’ order(we give ourselves permission) the assassination of foreign leaders. The fatalcancer of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez in 2013 was incredibly convenient at atime when the US and Israel were desperate to depose him for his exposure oftheir game plan. Chavez said publicly in 2010 that the Israelis were trying tokill him. Obama sunk to still more depths of depravity in February 2013 when hesigned a Presidential Memorandum waiving a previous ban on America supplyingweapons to countries that use child soldiers. A Presidential Memorandum is anorder issued to the executive branch of government – that is how easy it is tomake the abuse and killing of children or anyone else ‘legal’. Thisconstantly-parroted term ‘legal’ means nothing except that killers and criminalshave decided that they can be killers and criminals by signing a piece of paperto make their killing and criminality ‘legal’. The NDAA Act of 2013 specificallyprevented the closure of the death and torture camp at Guantanamo Bay whichObama had made a major pledge to close when he took office in 2009. He never hadany intention of doing so – his words were only aimed at getting elected so hecould continue business as usual. It is worth quietly pondering on this fact:there is a man in the White House with the power over life and death whenever hechooses, who can jail indefinitely anyone he chooses via made-up excuses and yetwe know little about his background – the official story is laughable. He hasnot produced a valid birth certificate to prove that he even qualifies to be aUS president (Fig 568). The fact that blatantly fake certificates have beenproduced to stop the speculation shows that there is something on the originalthat he absolutely doesn’t want the world to see. Either his birthplace does notqualify him to be president or the father/mother on the document would demolishthe official story. If you define sanity as balance and harmony and insanity asvarious degrees of distortion of that balance and harmony, then Obama issuffering from an extreme form of mental illness. He should be given treatment,not the presidency, and the same with ‘rivals’ like Mitt Romney and John McCain,both of whom are a psychiatrist’s life’s work. I think that Congressman Ron Paulis way off the pace in terms of the bigger picture of what is happening, but hesays many things that are clearly true about finance, the Federal Reserve andcalling for the troops to stop killing people and come home to their families.Well, to anyone in control of their own mind, they are. But he has beenridiculed by the crazies who think they are sane with lines like ‘someone eithergive Uncle Ron his meds or take him back to his room’. You can see once again inthe treatment of Ron Paul that wanting peace is viewed as a psychologicalillness while instigating and supporting war makes you a credible and‘streetwise’ statesman despite being an instigator or participant in massmurder. This is only the political expression of using an anti-war song for aSega war game while denying its use to promote peace and an end to conflict. Thesame applies to honesty and corruption. We have become so used to corruption –once again the new normal – that we have become sceptical and suspicious ofhonesty and integrity. As the British writer and actor, Noel Coward, put it:‘It’s discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how fewby deceit.’ The anti-slavery campaigner Frederick Douglass said: ‘I prefer to betrue to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, ratherthan to be false, and to incur my own abhorrence.’ He would never make apolitician.[../Images/00241.jpg]Figure 568: ‘Take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up back in your bedand you believe whatever [WE] want you to believe.’I look at country after country dominated by different cultures and religions,but I see the same common theme – the general population protesting against theactions of its governing classes. It is happening in Israel as it is happeningin America, Britain, Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Brazil, and more countriesall the time. We need to put down that which divides us – the nonsense of race,religion, politics and fake history – and come together with the understandingthat everyone is protesting against the same force which controls the IsraeliGovernment of whatever party just as it controls those of America, Britain,Greece, Spain, Italy and elsewhere. No more division. We are in this together.Oppressed Israelis need to find common cause with oppressed Palestinians and thesame with oppressed Greeks, Spaniards, Americans, Italians, Portuguese, British,Irish, Turks, Brazilians, Australians, Africans, Indians and others. Slowly, ohso slowly from my point of view, but quicker than ever before, it is beginningto dawn on many people what the game really is. Billions are being divided byrace, culture, religion and country so that the Archon hundreds at the very coreof the conspiracy can enslave and direct the lives of all the rest. If peoplewill only realise this and act upon it then the House of Cards will fall becauseit is the masses who are holding it together with stupidity, ignorance,arrogance and child-like naïvety.*Postscript: As this book went to press, hundreds were killed in horrificviolence in Egypt in clashes between the Egyptian army and supporters of theMuslim Brotherhood and deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, who was removed by amilitary coup. This was classic US/UK/Israel destabilisation (divide and rule)in league with Saudi Arabia with both the Brotherhood inner circle and the armyowned by the forces that control the United States which gives $1.3 billion ayear to the Egyptian military. It is no coincidence that Robert Ford wasnominated to be US Ambassador to Egypt as the violence unfolded. Ford ran deathsquads to destabilise Iraq and the wider Middle East when he was stationed atthe embassy in Baghdad and went on to become Ambassador to Syria just before theviolence erupted there."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00026.jpg]Archon ZionismAlways forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.Oscar WildeThe secret society that I call Rothschild Zionism controls the United StatesGovernment and politics in general via front organisations like the AmericanIsrael Public Affairs Committee, an extremely powerful and influential lobbygroup representing a foreign power and widely known as AIPAC.The United States Congress, the White House and the Pentagon are in its pocketand those who would rather not be prostituted to Zionism know the consequencesof not doing so in the form of opponents being funded to oust you, getting a badpress and any secret you would rather stay that way coming to light. This is whywe were ‘treated’ to the puke-making sight of Israel Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu receiving nearly 30 standing ovations for talking total baloney beforeboth Houses of Congress in 2011. The ‘representatives of the people’ were‘singing’, or standing and clapping, for their supper – pay-outs from richRothschild Zionist donors and the promise not to destroy them through the meansI’ve described. Rothschild Zionism is a global network that operates across allborders and one of its most powerful and influential groups was established inthe Soviet Union after Rothschild Zionist Lenin seized power thanks toRothschild money and manipulation. This is known today as the Russian Mafia, RedMafia, or ‘Red Octopus’, and it has a highly significant presence in New Yorkand the wider United States with strong ties to the Rothschilds, theAnti-Defamation League (ADL), AIPAC and Mossad. Robert Friedman exposed in hisbook Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America that the ‘RussianMafia’ is really the ‘Jewish Mafia’ and he died of a ‘tropical disease’ afterpeople he named put a price on his head. Friedman’s work was echoed by Jewishwriter Laura Radanko, a long-time researcher of the Russian Mafia and author ofThe Russian Mafia in America:> During the detente days of the early 1970s, when Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev> had agreed to allow the limited emigration of Soviet Jews, thousands of> hard-core criminals, many of them released from Soviet Gulags by the KGB, took> advantage of their nominal Jewish status to swarm into the United States ...> In the 1970s, more than forty thousand Russian Jews settled in Brighton Beach> [in New York]. It was under the shadow of the elevated subway tracks on> Brighton Beach Avenue, bustling with Russian meat markets, vegetable> pushcarts, and bakeries, that the Russian gangsters resumed their careers as> professional killers, thieves, and scoundrels.Radanko says that there are 30 Russian crime syndicates operating in the UnitedStates with major ones in New York, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles andDenver. Another tide of Russian Zionists relocated to the US in the 1990s, amongthem former KGB officers and veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. They andtheir successors are so merciless that it is said ‘they will shoot people justto see if their guns work’. More empathy-deleted psychopaths, in other words.This makes it easier to understand why American politicians jump to attentionwhen the Zionists speak. There are many ‘incentives’ to do this and not all ofthem are financial. Israel is of course the ‘spiritual’ home of the RothschildZionists – Russian and otherwise – and a safe place to run when trouble brews.Dr M Raphael Johnson wrote the following in a Barnes Review article called TheJudeo-Russian Mafia: From the Gulag to Brooklyn to World Dominion:> The roots of Jewish organized crime go far back into tsarist times. Organized> crime syndicates assisted Lenin’s gangs in bank robberies and the creation of> general mayhem. During the socalled revolution, it was difficult, sometimes> impossible, to distinguish between Bolshevik ideologues and Jewish organized> crime syndicates.

The Israeli state will not extradite its citizens to> non-Jewish countries, and, therefore, Jewish murderers can quite easily escape> punishment in Israel.There is Zionist law and the law the Zionists demand is imposed on everyoneelse. Then we have the manipulation of political events through the chequebookand wire transfer. Alan Hart, a former BBC and Independent Television Newscorrespondent, wrote in Zionism: The Real Enemy of the Jews: ‘Jewish people makeup less than two percent of the American population, but account for 50 percentof the political campaign contributions.’ This incredible amount of politicalfunding (control and influence) does not come from Jewish people in general, butfrom the mega-rich individuals, banks and corporations controlled by RothschildZionism. Obama’s biggest corporate donor was the Rothschild Zionist-ownedGoldman Sachs, the organisation (with others) fundamentally responsible for theengineered global economic crash which has caused such death and sufferingworldwide. Hey, but think of all that energy to trawl and vampire. RothschildZionists fund and control the Republicans as they do the Democrats.Establishment candidates in the 2012 Republican presidential campaign werepuppets, string-pulled by Rothschild Zionist money and policy demands. This iswhy they will say anything, no matter how extreme and ridiculous, that supportsthe goals of Israel. Investigative journalist Christopher Bollyn has revealedhow Newt Gingrich was funded in the 2012 presidential campaign to the tune of atleast $5 million by Rothschild Zionist casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, aclose friend of Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu (Fig 569). Mitt Romney, whowon the Republican nomination, had the Rothschild Zionist Crown family fromChicago behind his campaign which, according to Bollyn, has close connections tothe Rothschild/Israeli Mossad. Rothschild Zionism dictates American foreignpolicy and has engineered the stream of overseas wars of acquisition and massslaughter (Archon food source). It was the Rothschild Zionist-dominatedneoconservative or neocon networks behind the Boy Bush administration that used9/11 as the excuse to invade Afghanistan and they were the architects of the‘War on Terror’ that led to the invasion of Iraq using the lie about weapons ofmass destruction. The man credited with being among the first to ‘warn’ aboutthe threat of ‘global Islam’ is Avi Lipkin, pen name Victor Mordecai, with his1995 book, Is Fanatic Islam a Global Threat? Lipkin is an American-born Israeliwho served in the Israeli Defense Forces and in the intelligence department ofthe press office of Israeli Prime Minister and terrorist, Yitzhak Shamir. Lipkinclaims to have spoken in 500 churches worldwide and his role is to bring theChristian Zionists on board with his ‘Islam must be stopped’, ‘Armageddon’claptrap. I am no supporter of any religion, and certainly not Islam, but by farthe greatest danger to the world is from the satanic orchestrators of RothschildZionism. They own and control the global media to dictate the way that theirmanipulations and wars are reported to the population for whom they have acontempt so deep that words cannot be found. Rothschild Zionist columnist JoelStein wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2008: ‘I don’t care if Americans thinkwe’re running the news media, Hollywood, Wall Street or the government. I justcare that we get to keep running them.’ If anyone else said that Zionistscontrol the news media, Hollywood, Wall Street and the government they would becondemned as racists and neo-Nazis – even though they say it themselves. Thesheer arrogance of those representing less than two percent of the Americanpopulation is unspeakable. Rothschild Zionists are behind the banking system,chemically-infested food and water, Big Pharma medicine, Internet censorship,the law and political correctness, the list is endless. This is not to describeJewish people as a whole, very many of whom are victims of the Zionists, as inNazi Germany. I am talking about the inner circle secret society of RothschildZionism and its agents and gofers placed in key positions throughout the system.These people are Archonticly insane and they have a considerable nuclear andchemical weapons stockpile which they refuse to allow to be inspected and refuseto sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty while condemning Iran over itsnuclear threat when it doesn’t even have a nuclear weapon. The United States,Britain and the ‘West’ say nothing about Israel’s nuclear and chemical weaponsarsenal. They don’t even acknowledge its existence but demonise the non-nuclearIran as a nuclear threat – a country that has not attacked anyone since 1798.The United States in extreme contrast has hardly stopped doing so since the dayit was established (Fig 570). Iran has one of the lowest military budgets in theMiddle East while Israel is one of the most trigger-happy countries on Earthwith one of the world’s best equipped militaries largely thanks to the UStaxpayer (Fig 571). The reference in the political cartoon to ‘Vanunu’ isMordechai Vanunu, the former nuclear technician who told the truth to a Britishnewspaper about the Israeli weapons programme at Dimona in the Negev desert. Hewas kidnapped by Mossad, the Rothschild enforcement agency, and jailed for 18years with more than 11 of them in solitary confinement after a ‘trial’ held insecret. Vanunu still can’t leave Israel or talk to foreign journalists since hismulticonditional release in 2004. The response of the Rothschild-Zionistcontrolled ‘free world’ to any of this? Silence. The nuclear stockpile thatVanunu exposed is not even Israel’s. It belongs to the Rothschilds and was madepossible by the manipulations of Lord Victor Rothschild who controlled BritishIntelligence, as I outlined earlier. This is insider Israeli historian, Martinvan Creveld, giving us a chilling reminder of the mentality with its finger onthe Rothschild Zionist nuclear button:[../Images/00434.jpg]Figure 569: Gingrich and Adelson: ‘You sing, Newt, and I’ll wire.’[../Images/00196.jpg]Figure 570: Yes, Iran is a threat to America and America only wants peace.[../Images/00213.jpg]Figure 571: Hypocrisy as an incurable disease.> We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at> targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are> targets for our air force ... We have the capability to take the world down> with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.Once again, what was the response to the Rothschild Zionist ‘free world’ to thisthreat? Still more silence. But they can’t find a microphone quick enough tocondemn Iran and other targets. This includes the constantly-repeated claim thatIran’s former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has said that Israel should bewiped off the map when he actually called for the end of the Zionist regime inIsrael and for a Middle East where Muslims, Jews, and Christians would livetogether in liberty. There is no way that this scale of nuclear and chemicalweapons capability has been stockpiled by Israel for the defence of a populationof less than eight million on a sliver of land in the Middle East. People betterwake up to what is happening and fast. The Israeli (Rothschild) enforcement armMossad is the world expert at what is called false flag operations – doing thedeed and blaming it on others – and they were at the core of what happened on9/11 to give the Rothschild Zionist neocons the excuse to start ticking targetcountries off their hit list. They have all this power over American society andthey have contempt for Americans and American interests. Israel even attackedthe USS Liberty in international waters during the Six Day War in June, 1967,which involved Israel, Egypt, and other Arab countries. Egypt was blamed for theattack on the Liberty in another demonisation exercise, but it later emergedthat the ship was hit by Israeli aircraft and torpedo boats. Thirty-fourAmerican crewmen were killed, more than 170 wounded and the ship was severelydamaged. Israel incredibly claimed ‘mistaken identity’ when the truth wasexposed. Consequences for Israel? None. How could there be when the samenetworks control America, Canada, Britain and the European Union, Australia, NewZealand and so on and so on? Andrew Adler, the moronic Rothschild Zionistpublisher of the Atlanta Jewish Times, said that Israel should consider orderingMossad to assassinate Obama so that his replacement would defend Israel againstIran. Adler said:> Order a hit on a president in order to preserve Israel’s existence. Think> about it. If you have thought of this Tom-Clancy-type scenario, don’t you> think that this almost unfathomable idea has been discussed in Israel’s most> inner circles?They have certainly done this before. Mossad and Israel were the major playersin the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, as I detail in ... And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. Adler was forced to apologise for his remarks, but hisbiggest crime from the Rothschild Zionist point of view was that he wasrevealing how they work. A report in the online Foreign Policy Journal said theUnited States Intelligence community has produced a draft paper urging thegovernment to end its slavish support for Israel. The paper, called PreparingFor A Post Israel Middle East, is said to have been compiled by 16 agencies witha total budget between them of more than $70 billion. It describes Israel ascurrently the greatest threat to US national interests which are fundamentallyat odds with Rothschild Zionist Israel. It apparently reveals ...> ... Gross Israeli interference in the internal affairs of the United States> through spying and illegal US arms transfers. This includes supporting more> than 60 ‘front organizations’ and approximately 7,500 US officials who do> Israel’s bidding and seek to dominate and intimidate the media and agencies of> the US government ...So few, yet so manyMembers of the Rothschild Zionist secret society are everywhere that theOrwellian agenda is being orchestrated and imposed. A white paper presented tothe US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence called for an ‘evolvingmission’ for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that moves away from‘fighting terrorism’ into an East German ‘Stasi-like’ domestic surveillance andintelligence operation. This, of course, was what was always planned as my bookshave said since Homeland Security was created. The white paper, entitledHomeland Security and Intelligence: Next Steps in Evolving the Mission, waspresented by the Homeland Security Group at the Aspen Institute, an organisationI have been exposing since the early 1990s. The Aspen Institute HomelandSecurity Group is co-chaired by a man who encapsulates everything that I havesaid here. His name is Michael Chertoff (Fig 572). He is:[../Images/00327.jpg]Figure 572: Isn’t synchronicity incredible?> • The son of a Mossad agent and duel American-Israeli citizen.> • The Assistant Attorney General who freed more than 100 Israeli spies in the> US after 9/11 and the ‘dancing Israelis’ (Mossad agents) arrested for cheering> and high-fiving when the towers were hit and filming the event with obvious> prior knowledge.> • The co-author of the freedom-busting Patriot Act justified by 9/11.> • The second Director of Homeland Security, an organisation justified by 9/11.> • The main promoter of full-body airport radiation scanners produced by a> company represented by his own Chertoff Group – scanners that were introduced> because of the ‘underpants bomber’ who boarded his plane without a passport at> Amsterdam airport where the ‘security’ is operated by an Israeli company.Chertoff personifies the way that the Rothschild Zionism secret society placesits agents and initiates in the essential place at the essential times to ensurethat the world is transformed and directed according to its blueprint for globalconquest. They do not represent Jewish people, but a force of evil that seeks toenslave us all, including Jewish people. The Rothschild Zionist politicalnetwork in the United Kingdom includes the Friends of Israel, which has a branchin every major political party, and the Britain Israel Communications andResearch Centre (BICOM). These are in truth, like AIPAC in the US, the BritainIsrael Propaganda Centre. BICOM lists its activities as the following:> • ‘Providing real-time briefings and high quality in-depth research.’ [Selling> Rothschild Zionist propaganda to the political and media classes.]> • ‘Publishing daily briefings, which give coverage to all Israel-related news> as reported in the British and Israeli print and online media, as well as> analysis of the main stories of the day.’ [Selling Rothschild Zionist> propaganda to the political and media classes.]> • ‘Organising and delivering visitor programmes for key politicians, academics> and journalists.’ [Paying for them to visit Israel, be wined and dined and> primed to promote the Rothschild Zionist agenda.]BICOM’s former chief executive Danny Scheck was a leading official of theIsraeli foreign ministry and a chief spokesman and director of the pressdivision of the ministry. He left BICOM to become Israel’s ambassador to France.The present chief executive is Lorna Fitzsimons, a former Labour MP. Fitzsimonstold the Herzliya Conference, a major stage for the leading political names inIsrael to present their policy, that ‘public opinion does not influence foreignpolicy in Britain. Foreign policy is an elite issue’. Actually, it is largely aRothschild Zionist issue (same thing, I guess) and is currently channelledthrough Rothschild Zionist Prime Minister David Cameron and Rothschild ZionistForeign Secretary William ‘What do I say and when do I say it, sir?’ Hague. TheHerzliya Conference is sponsored by the Israeli think-tank, the Institute forPolicy and Strategy, which is headed by Daniel Rothschild. Once you gain controlof major countries you control the groupings of those countries like the UnitedNations and the European Union. The Rothschild Zionist-controlled media meansthat the bias and breathtaking over-representation of a small minority group ingovernment, banking, business and media is almost never highlighted orquestioned. But if the same was true of Arabs, Russians, Chinese or blackpeople, there would be an outcry. The BBC’s bias towards Israel and againstPalestinians or any critics of Israel is legendary. This media-control alsomeans that considerable and vehement opposition to Rothschild Zionism by manyJewish people is rarely reported and so the public is given the impression thatall Jewish people are Zionists (absolutely not true) – see Figure 573. TheRothschild-appointed voices of Zionism, including the Anti-Defamation League andB’nai B’rith, are portrayed as if they speak for all Jewish people when theyspeak for the Rothschilds. Politicians are cowered into silence by thewell-oiled and funded condemnation-machine when any of them speak out of turnand question the perfection of Israel. The Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Tongeresigned from the party after she said that Israel in its present form would notgo on forever because it would reap what it has sowed. The Labour Party leaderEd Miliband (Rothschild Zionist) said there was ‘no place in politics for thosewho question the existence of the state of Israel’ (criticise the state ofIsrael) while Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg (Rothschild Zionist) said thather remarks were ‘wrong and offensive and do not reflect the values of theLiberal Democrats’. This is a gimme given that the ‘values’ of Clegg and theLiberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative parties (see also Democrats andRepublicans) are to nod frantically to anything that Israel demands whilefuriously licking the Rothschild arse. This is required by their unofficial oathof office. Baroness Tonge was also sacked as the Lib-Dem health spokesman in2010 for saying that Israeli troops sent to Haiti after the earthquake weretrafficking human organs. No one bothered to find out if it was true when therehave been many reports of the Israeli trafficking of organs taken from livepeople. Protecting victims is not their priority only protecting their ownbacksides. Someone has criticised Israel so they have to call the army out.Liberal Democrat MP David Ward got the treatment at the time of HolocaustMemorial Day in 2013 when he said how sad it was that within a few years ofliberation from the concentration camps Jewish people were inflicting atrocitieson Palestinians in the new State of Israel ‘and continue to do so on a dailybasis in the West Bank and Gaza’. What is wrong with that? It is a perfectlyvalid observation that you would think those who had been treated so badly inNazi Germany would not treat others so badly and especially so soon. The reasonis that the same Rothschild forces behind Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russiacreated and control Israel. Ward soon realised that you need balls of steel whenyou criticise Israel while representing a party with balls the size ofnanotechnology and tongues the length of the River Nile (see also theConservative Party, Labour Party, Democrats and Republicans, pick your countryand it’s all the same). The Rothschild Zionist lobby jumped to theirreflex-action condemnation (they do outrage like no others) and Clegg and theLiberal Democrats jumped to reflex-action attention. Ward apologised ‘sincerely’and according to the Jewish Chronicle he agreed not to use the term ‘the Jews’ever again in the same context. Soon it will be any context other than praiseand eulogy. The Rothschild Zionist networks are the bullies of the world andthey have intimidated most politicians into global silence. They have done it tome, too, as you can see, and I would like to apologise unreservedly to those whohave killed children and civilians week after week in Gaza and the West Bank forcausing any unintended offence by showing the picture in Figure 574, and forventuring the view that they are a bunch of clinicallyinsane, heartless,brainless, fascist psychopaths. When is the Multiple-Thousands of Dead ChildrenKilled By Israel Memorial Day – can anyone tell me?[../Images/00188.jpg]Figure 573: All Jews fear Iran, says the propaganda. Oh really? Jews with Iran’sthen President Ahmadinejad.[../Images/00176.jpg]Figure 574: Genocide in Palestine.No justice for RachelThe subjugation of world politics to the will of Israel (the Rothschilds) wasconfirmed yet again with the muted response to one of the most predictableoutcomes in legal history when an Israeli judge in an Israeli court ruled thatan Israeli soldier was not responsible for killing American peace activistRachel Corrie by driving over her in a bulldozer. The thoroughly-decent23-year-old was wearing a luminous jacket and had been talking through amegaphone when she stood in front of the Israeli military bulldozer provided bythe Caterpillar company in the United States and used to mercilessly demolishthe homes of Palestinians (Figs 575 and 576). Alongside the driver was anothersoldier acting as a lookout. On March 16th 2003, Rachel Corrie was trying toprevent the demolition of homes at the Rafah refugee camp with other activistsfrom the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) which was founded byPalestinians, Americans and an Israeli to support the Palestinian cause throughnon-violent means. Corrie had studied the methods of Gandhi and Martin LutherKing and this is where she was coming from. Joe Carr, an American ISM activist,described what happened when the bulldozer arrived:[../Images/00267.jpg]Figure 575: The murder of Rachel Corrie.[../Images/00162.jpg]Figure 576: Heart never dies. Mind never lives.> Still wearing her fluorescent jacket, she knelt down at least 15 metres in> front of the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as> activists had successfully done dozens of times that day ... When it got so> close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of> rubble being pushed by the bulldozer ...> ... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer’s blade, and the> bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the> operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the> driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly> pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and> shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued> forward, until Rachel was all the way underneath the central section of the> bulldozer.Eyewitness Richard Purssell, from Brighton, England, said:> She was standing on top of a pile of earth. The driver cannot have failed to> see her. As the blade pushed the pile, the earth rose up. Rachel slid down the> pile. It looks as if her foot got caught. The driver didn’t slow down; he just> ran over her. Then he reversed the bulldozer back over her again.Another witness, Tom Dale, from Staffordshire, England, remembers:> The bulldozer went towards her very slowly. She was fully in clear view,> straight in front of them. Unfortunately she couldn’t keep her grip there and> she started to slip down. You could see she was in serious trouble, there was> panic in her face as she was turning around. All the activists there were> screaming, running towards the bulldozer, trying to get them to stop. But they> just kept on going.Sami Nasrallah, who lived in the house that Corrie was seeking to protect, said:‘When she saw the bulldozer coming toward my house she stood in front of it,defending my house with her body without a weapon or anything.’ Rachel Corriewas clearly an outstanding human being who had headed for Gaza after she learnedabout the suffering of the Palestinian people from a young man at school ofPalestinian origin. But decent people trying to do decent things don’t matter tothe crazies that control Israel. Nine years after Corrie died an Israeli courtruled that what happened was an accident for which she was responsible. Amilitary ‘investigation’ had already absolved any Israeli of any responsibilitywhatsoever and in Israel’s one-party military state the civil verdict was a mereformality. The court employed the ‘combatant activities’ exception which saysthat Israeli troops cannot be held responsible for physical or economic harm tocivilians in an area defined as a war zone. So designate a target area a warzone and you can do whatever you like. Judge Oded Gershon said that Corrie, oneof several peace activists killed or maimed by the Israeli army, had ‘putherself in a dangerous situation’ and ruled that her death was ‘the result of anaccident she brought upon herself’. Once again – and as always – any Israeliinvolved in any way before or after her death was cleared of all blame.Gershon’s almost laughable bias was revealed in his statement that internationalactivists were seeking to disrupt the actions of the Israeli military by actingas human shields ‘to protect terrorists’. Corrie’s parents, who spent $200,000to bring the civil case, had no chance from the start; but I think they knewthat deep down and just wanted to take it as far as they could to expose whathad happened. They had one option left and that was to appeal to the IsraeliSupreme Court (housed in an Archontic symbol-ridden building funded by theRothschilds) but this court had already ruled that the driver of the bulldozercannot be prosecuted. Gershon’s ‘verdict’ was in support of the State by aservant of the State with all the blame heaped upon a young woman seeking tostop just one of a UN-estimated 17,000 home demolitions up to that point bycold, callous and utterly ruthless people who can do no wrong in the eyes of thegovernments in Israel, the United States, Britain, the European Union and muchof the rest of the world, including Australia and New Zealand. This is the waythat ‘justice’ operates in the land of the self-styled ‘Chosen People’ and thelands controlled by the ‘Chosen People’. Huwaida Arraf, a co-founder of theInternational Solidarity Movement, said:> The judge’s ruling today is outrageous in so many ways, not least of which is> the criticising of Rachel and the maligning of the International Solidarity> Movement in an effort to place blame on all but those who killed Rachel and> worked to cover it up.> These are the same institutions that continue to injure and kill thousands of> innocent Palestinians with no accountability. Not only does today’s verdict> mean that there is no justice for Rachel Corrie, but it also means that no> human rights defender is safe from Israeli state violence.All this is true but none of it matters to the Demiurge-demented Archons thatcontrol Israel and connect with the Demiurge-demented global cabal whichdictates the direction of the world. Israel appointed a new ‘Defence Minister’in 2013, Moshe Ya’alon, who said when he was Chief of Staff of the Israeli Armythat the ‘Palestinian threat’ was ‘like cancer’ and an ‘existential threat’, andthe solution was ‘applying chemotherapy’ (mass murder). Israel’s fascist ForeignMinister Avigdor Lieberman called on Ya’alon to radically redefine the rules ofengagement for the military in the occupied West Bank, encouraging them to shootstone-throwers as ‘terrorists’. These people are expressions of the Demiurge andthus completely mad.The ultimate rogue stateThere is an unwritten ‘international law’ that those who pontificate about‘rogue states’ refuse to acknowledge: Israel does as it likes, when it likes andto whomever it likes and it does so by controlling the political system and themajor media from which everything else comes. Israel’s then Prime Minister,Ariel Sharon (still in a coma since his massive stroke in 2006) told USPresident Boy Bush that Israel would conduct a ‘thorough, credible andtransparent’ investigation into Corrie’s death. I bet they had a good laughabout that one when the cameras stopped whirring. The Rothschild Zionist planfrom the start has been to buy enough time to commit the Palestinian people tohistory. What is happening, and what Rachael Corrie was trying to challenge, isnothing less than systematic genocide. American writer Steve Lendman, a host onthe Progressive News Network, had it right when he described what life is likefor Palestinians under Israeli (Rothschild Zionist) occupation. Imagine, hewrote, facing these conditions every day:> • Living in limbo under a foreign occupier. Having no self-determination, no> right of return, and no power over your daily life. Being in constant fear,> economically strangled, and collectively punished.> • Having your free movement denied by enclosed population centres, closed> borders, regular curfews, roadblocks, checkpoints, electric fences, and> separation walls. Having your homes regularly demolished and land> systematically stolen to build settlements for encroachers in violation of> international law prohibiting an occupier from settling its population on> conquered land.> • Having your right to essential services denied – to emergency health care,> education, employment, and enough food and clean water. Being forced into> extreme poverty, having your crops destroyed, and being victimised by punitive> taxes. Having no right for redress in the occupier’s courts under laws only> protecting the occupier.> • Being regularly targeted by incursions and attacks on the ground and from> the air. Being wilfully harassed, ethnically cleansed, arrested, incarcerated,> tortured, and slaughtered on any pretext, including for your right of> self-defence.> • Having no rights on your own land in your own country for over six decades> and counting. Vilified for being Muslims and called terrorists, Jihadists,> crazed Arabs, and fundamentalist extremists. Victimised by a slow motion> genocide to destroy you.This, as it happens, is pretty much what the global fascist state is planned tobe like. One story encapsulates the callous evil that Palestinians have to dealwith every day. Twelve-year-old Amal Samouni lost 21 members of her family andextended family when Israel bombed the Gaza Strip in 2009 including her fatherand a brother. She was badly injured and still has shrapnel in her skull.Palestinians can hardly breathe without permission and Amal had to apply for atravel permit (no, this is not Nazi Germany, well actually, it is) to attend ahospital appointment at al-Maqasid hospital in East Jerusalem. The Israeliauthorities refused her permission to travel without explanation and so shecould not have treatment (Fig 577). She is a 12-year-old girl who they badlywounded as a nineyear-old and whose family they destroyed. This is the Archon‘mind’ in every sense. Anyone questioning the term ‘genocide’ need only look atthe maps (Fig 578). The definition of genocide is: ‘The systematic andwidespread extermination or attempted extermination of an entire national,racial, religious, or ethnic group.’ I rest my case. Israeli historian IlanPappe wrote in 2006:[../Images/00077.jpg]Figure 577: ‘Israel’s existence is threatened – we only want peace.’> A genocide is taking place in Gaza ... An average of eight Palestinians die> daily in the Israeli attacks on the Strip. Most of them are children. Hundreds> are maimed, wounded and paralyzed. [It’s become] a daily business, now> reported [only] in the internal pages of the local press, quite often in> microscopic fonts. The chief culprits are the Israeli pilots who have a field> day, like shooting fish in a barrel. Why not, they’re only Muslims, so who’ll> notice or care?[../Images/00230.jpg]Figure 578: One word – genocide.Add to this the fact that the best part of a million Palestinians fled thecountry in terror in the period before the State of Israel was declared in 1948because of mass murder by the Rothschild Zionist terror groups such as Haggadah,Irgun and the Stern Gang and their terrorist operatives such as Menachem Beginand Yitzhak Shamir who later became prime ministers of Israel. ThosePalestinians forced to leave their own land by terror and their descendants nownumber some five million but they are denied the right to return by thepresent-day terrorists in Tel Aviv. All this has been happening decade afterdecade as the Rothschild-controlled politicians in the United States, Canada,Britain, Australia, New Zealand and others have looked the other way whilearrogantly targeting, destabilising and bombing, or supporting the bombing, ofother countries on the grounds of their governments killing and abusing thepopulation. But Israel can do what it likes and the politicians of the West andmuch of the rest of the world stay schtum. Israel can attack ships ininternational waters and murder loving, caring young people bringing suppliesdesperately needed by a Gaza Strip blockaded by the Israeli military to stem thedelivery of food, fuel, medicines and other essential needs in the most tragicand populated piece of land on the planet. Agents of the Israeli/RothschildMossad can walk into a hotel in Dubai after entering the country with fakeBritish passports and kill a leader of the Palestinian Hamas without anyconsequences whatsoever even though the faces of these Mossad agents (Israeliterrorists) were all over the Internet after being captured on hotel securitycameras (Fig 579). The British Foreign Secretary at the time, David Miliband(Rothschild Zionist), brother of current Labour Party leader Ed Miliband(Rothschild Zionist) did nothing in response except to prevaricate and thenforget all about it. Israel can bomb Lebanon, Syria and the defenceless GazaStrip while the world sits on its hands and tapes over its tongue except to saythat ‘Israel has a right to defend itself’. If you use that pea-shooter I willrespond with a missile – I have the right to defend myself. Israel can breach,according to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, virtually all 149articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the treatment of civiliansunder occupation and in war zones (Fig 580). It can commit and get away withwhat the UN Commission describes as war crimes against the Palestinians underthe terms of the Convention and the 1945 Nuremberg Charter. How much more are wegoing to take from the playground bully and spoilt child?[../Images/00395.jpg]Figure 579: Mossad agents were caught on hotel cameras, but nothing happened.[../Images/00395.jpg]Figure 580: The world is mad.Rothschild Zionists continually point out the consequences of Nazi fascism whilepromoting their own version as standing against fascism. Jiddu Krishnamurti, theIndian speaker and writer, said: ‘It is no measure of health to be well-adjustedto a profoundly sick society.’ But that is where most people are – politiciansand Rothschild Zionists more than anyone. The profoundly sick society is theirnormal and so to them it is not profoundly sick. There was controversy inBritain in early 2013 about a football manager called Paolo Di Canio. He washired by Sunderland in the top division and suddenly what had not been a majorproblem and hardly ever mentioned became a national story. Di Canio had made thefascist salute during a match when he played for Lazio in Italy and describedhis political views in 2005 in terms that he was ‘a fascist, not a racist’. Hehas also said that Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was ‘basically a veryprincipled, ethical individual’ who was ‘deeply misunderstood’. Now in my world,although I profoundly disagree with him, he has a right to those views so longas he doesn’t force them and the consequences on anyone and there was absolutelyno evidence of that. They are just his views and he’s a football manager, notstanding for Parliament or starting a political movement. The media storm overDi Canio’s appointment was triggered by the resignation from the club in protestby non-executive vice-chairman David Miliband (Rothschild Zionist), the formerForeign Secretary as I have just mentioned. Miliband resigned in protest at theviews expressed eight years earlier by Di Canio, a football player and managerwho has done nothing to put what he believes into political practice. Miliband,the ‘man of principle’, wanted to make a statement that he abhorred fascism –not least as a member of a Jewish Marxist family whose mother lived in mainlandEurope during the Nazi era. Yes, very principled. But wait. Isn’t this the sameDavid Miliband, a British Foreign Secretary and former close advisor to TonyBlair, who supported the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq which killed andmaimed for life millions of civilians based on lies?; is this the same man whotaped his mouth and sat on his hands in the face of the ever-unfolding genocideagainst Palestinians by Israel when as Foreign Secretary he could have loudlyand continually condemned and exposed what was happening? It surely is. The sameDavid Miliband who resigned very publicly in protest at the views some yearsbefore of a football manager who, to my knowledge, has never voted to bomb andslaughter anyone. I may not agree with Di Canio’s views, but I know which of thetwo has done most to put fascism into practice and who therefore is the greaterdanger to the world. Miliband will not for a second see this gross hypocrisybecause he is well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society. To him, his supportfor mass murder in faraway countries cannot be equated with fascism and nor canwhat Israel is doing daily to Palestinians. His brain is firewalled from suchconnections, but when someone voices support for an officially-labelled fascistlike Mussolini he can thrust his nose in the air in holier-than-thou indignance.Being well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society means to equate bombingcivilian targets with a legitimate action to advance the principles of the ‘freeworld’. Profound sickness becomes their version of normal and rational. If youare born into a madhouse and you grow up there knowing nothing else then thehappenings in the madhouse become your version of normal. Tell someone in thissituation that what is happening is madness and they will call you mad. This ishow so many perceive world events and their daily lives. In the same way, Israelis the most racist society on Earth and yet hurls that label in all directionsat anyone who dares to question that it is not the very symbol of sweetness andlight.Rothschild Zionists, not ‘Jews’But remember that I am using the term Rothschild Zionist for all this and notJewish people in general. There are many Jews that you rarely hear about whocome not from the belief that they are above all others, but from one ofdecency, compassion, intelligence and a sense of justice. Among them is GideonLevy, a columnist with the Israeli daily, Haaretz, who said of the RachaelCorrie case:> This week, the judge in Haifa added his verdict to a long and embarrassing> list of court rulings aimed at sanctioning almost every kind of improper act> committed by the IDF. The message is clear: Israel doesn’t want people of> conscience at a time when it is doing mischief. They are risking their lives.> And the message to the soldiers is: It is permitted to kill them; nothing bad> will happen to you. When the IDF acts in this way, it is perhaps possible to> understand it, but when the judicial system sanctions this, it is depravity.> Behold, Rachel, behold – your death was not in vain. It at least revealed,> once again, that the Israeli judicial system is a partner to the foul deeds.Other Jewish exposers of Rothschild Zionists include the great NormanFinkelstein who has had his academic career destroyed by them in America forspeaking out and the superb Gilad Atzmon, the Israeli-born jazz musician,novelist, activist and writer. See his book, The Wandering Who? Finkelstein’sparents suffered in the Nazi concentration camps but they and he have beenintelligent and compassionate enough to see through the Rothschild Zionistexploitation of Jewish people and the genocidal treatment of the Palestinians.See his book, The Holocaust Industry. Gilad Atzmon served as a paramedic in theIsraeli Defense Forces (IDF) in the war with Lebanon in 1982 and he concludedthat he was ‘part of a colonial state, the result of plundering and ethniccleansing.’ He said that it was only then that he learned about Palestinianrefugees in Lebanon unable to return home and of the destruction of their homesand villages. ‘We were indoctrinated into a denial of the Palestinian cause’, hesaid. ‘We were not aware of it.’ This is the foundation of the RothschildZionist strategy. Keep those that you claim to represent in ignorance of whatyou are doing, have already done, and plan to do. Jewish people who buy the lieare among the most indoctrinated on the planet because of their incessant andsystematic cradle-to-grave programming. Atzmon highlights the judge’s statementin his verdict about Rachel Corrie not behaving ‘reasonably’. But whatconstitutes ‘reasonably’? Atzmon rightly points out the difference in thedefinition of ‘reasonable’ between a young, idealistic, peace-loving Americangirl and the fanatics that run Israel and its establishment systems:> Being an American youngster, Corrie mistakenly believed that Israeli soldiers> were humanly driven. Being a reasonable person she must have believed that an> Israeli bulldozer driver would never drive over her body. She was wrong.> Corrie clearly failed to grasp that Israeli ‘reasoning’ was lethally fuelled> by psychosis and fantasies of destruction.> Corrie failed precisely where so many solidarity activists fail. Israel is no> normal state. It is a state of one people only – and a people who believe> themselves to be chosen. The meaning of this is both simple and devastating.> The people of Israel believe that their lives and security is a cosmic asset> that must be maintained at the expense of the rest of humanity.> However, make no mistake, Israeli psychosis is consistent and even driven by> reason, but this ‘reason’ is somewhat different to that of the rest of us. It> is certainly far from being universal. Rachel Corrie, on the other hand, is a> universal symbol. She is the epitome of solidarity, empathic thinking and> courage, but her tragic death is also a clear indication that something is> fundamentally wrong with Israel.> Rachel Corrie’s death makes it clear that it isn’t just the Israeli leadership> or military elite who are blind to human life and moral conduct. It isn’t just> Netanyahu or Barak who are in a state of dismissal of human life. We are> dealing here with a murderous continuum; it is the leadership, the anonymous> soldier, the bulldozer driver – and also Judge Gershon and the Israeli legal> system.As the Israeli-American-British alliance (Rothschild) gets ever closer tocompleting the destruction of the Palestinian people in their own lands, thesqueeze has been applied to stop the true horrors of what is happening beingreported. There are increasing restrictions being applied on journalists andhuman rights organisations to enter Gaza to prevent such exposure, and thedeaths of peace activists is a warning for them to keep away or get the same.Judge Gershon’s verdict was yet another reminder. Rothschild fronts like theAnti-Defamation League want to demonise those who challenge the horrors that thePalestinians daily endure as promoting racial hatred against Jews when we areseeking to promote basic humanity. This is not about race; it is about commondecency. Many Jewish people can see this, including the magnificent youngIsraelis who go to jail rather than serve the genocide through compulsoryconscription to the Israeli military and play their part in abusing and killingPalestinians. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets toprotest against government policies and their economic plight. At least two haveset themselves on fire in protest at what is happening – one died and the othersuffered 80 percent burns. Moshe Silman died after setting himself alight at aprotest against inequality and he left a note condemning the Israeliestablishment for ‘taking from the poor to give to the rich’. The other man wasa disabled Israeli war veteran who was protesting at the treatment of formertroops by officials in charge of rehabilitating veterans. People rightlyhighlight the billions transferred from American taxpayers to Israel every year,but it doesn’t go to the Israeli population in general. It is taken from theAmerican people by the American Rothschild-controlled El-lite and handed to theIsraeli Rothschild El-lite. The US draft intelligence paper that I mentionedearlier, reported by the Foreign Policy Journal, is said to stress that many inthe American Jewish community are sick of Israel’s behaviour. It is said torefer to the ‘expanding chasm among American Jews objecting to Zionism andIsraeli practices’ which include ‘the killing and brutalizing of Palestiniansunder Israeli occupation’. It is reported to say that these are gross violationsof American and International Law ‘and raise questions within the US Jewishcommunity regarding the American responsibility to protect innocent civiliansunder occupation’. It goes on:> Israel, given its current brutal occupation and belligerence, cannot be> salvaged any more than apartheid South Africa could be when as late as 1987.> Israel was the only ‘Western’ nation that upheld diplomatic ties with South> Africa and was the last country to join the international boycott campaign> before the regime collapsed.If Rothschild Zionism and the entire Archon edifice of corruption andmanipulation was brought to book and brought to heel and its inner core andleadership was put on a diet of prison food it is not only Israel that woulddramatically change for the better. So would the entire world."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00303.jpg]Archon EconomicsNowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.Oscar WildeThe Control System has been designed so that money is the foundation ofeverything. Having or not having it dictates where you live, what you eat,whether you eat, where you work, whether you work, if you live or die, andalmost every life-choice imaginable. This is the idea. It means that those whocontrol the money control the world and the wars. The Archon bloodlines –especially the Rothschilds – control the money (Fig 581).The Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars mass manipulation manual appropriately detailsat length how the financial system is controlled and directed towards the goalof human control and it acknowledges the central part played by the House ofRothschild. The document describes how the global economy and its nationalcomponents are structured as an electrical and energetic system. ‘Money’ is onlya form of energy because everything is and today it is mostly electronic datacalled ‘credit’ passing around a global computer system with cash being rapidlytaken out of circulation. I have made the point in my other books that theRothschilds and the Archon networks see money as flows of energy and they haveimposed a system that ensures that pretty much all of it flows to them in theend. The Silent Weapons manual says:> Economics is only a social extension of a natural energy system ... Since> energy is the key to all activity on the face of the earth, it follows that in> order to attain a monopoly of energy, raw materials, goods, and services and> to establish a world system of slave labor, it is necessary to have a first> strike capability in the field of economics.> In order to maintain our position, it is necessary that we have absolute first> knowledge of the science of control over all economic factors and the first> experience at engineering the world economy.> In order to achieve such sovereignty, we must at least achieve this one end:> that the public will not make either the logical or mathematical connection> between economics and the other energy sciences, or learn to apply such> knowledge.This theme of creating a banking system that the target population does notunderstand was captured by a member of the Rothschild dynasty (there are somany) called Nathaniel Meyer Rothschild. He apparently told a group ofinternational bankers in 1912: ‘The few who could understand the system willeither be so interested in its profits, or so dependent on its favours, thatthere will be no opposition from that class, while on the other hand, the greatbody of people, mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantagethat capital derives from the system, will bear its burdens without complaint,and perhaps without even suspecting that the system is inimical to theirinterests.’ And so it was and still is. Silent Weapons says this in summarisingthe economic system:[../Images/00057.jpg]Figure 581: Control the money and, in today’s world, you control the people.> To make a short story of it all, it was discovered that an economy obeyed the> same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical theory and practical> and computer know-how developed for the electronic field could be directly> applied in the study of economics.> This discovery was not openly declared, and its more subtle implications were> and are kept a closely guarded secret, for example that in an economic model,> human life is measured in dollars, and that the electric spark generated when> opening a switch connected to an active inductor is mathematically analogous> to the initiation of war.Booms and busts, war and peace, are all factored into the computer model to pushhuman society ever closer with maximum speed and efficiency to an Orwellianglobal state. Is it not so true in this distorted world that human life isindeed ‘measured in dollars’? All this is a form of mass energy-vampiring, too.As money passes through our lives some of our own energy – life-force – attachesto the electromagnetic information fields that we call money. This energeticattachment is made during our temporary ownership or possession. When this moneyreturns to source through the repayment of loans and interest, taxation in allits forms and spending money with corporations etc., so some of our energy goeswith it. The same applies to energy parasites like Facebook who claimjoint-copyright to anything posted on a Facebook page to use in any way theylike even when you are no longer a Facebook member. This is the vampiring of thecreative energy and imagination of the human masses which the Archons don’thave.There is no moneyThe highest levels of the Archon bloodlines and their hidden masters obviouslyknow that we live in a holographic illusion of their creation and as long ashumanity can be kept ignorant of this fact there is nothing the population cando to free themselves from the mind-prison. This means that while humans largelysee money as ‘physical’ and ‘real’, the Archontic force sees energetic fieldsand illusions. There are two fundamentally different realities being lived inthe same ‘world’ (frequency range) and this is certainly the case with theillusion called money. The systematically-ignorant masses see money as somethingtangible – a coin, a note or even a credit card. It exists, it’s real. I mean,it buys things doesn’t it? But the Archons know that money is an energeticfigment of programmed imagination. There is no ‘money’ as humans believe it tobe, only a perception of money as they believe it to be. What is a coin reallyworth? Only the value of its metallic content and even then only what someone isprepared to pay in given circumstances. In other words, next to nothing andoften nothing. What is a paper note worth no matter what the size of the numberimprinted upon it? The value of the paper, that’s all, but then who would wantto buy little bits of paper already made unusable by the printing all over them?What is electronic money really worth? Nothing. It is only an electroniccomputer code and what value or use to anyone is that in and of itself? Quiteobviously money is virtually worthless and most of it completely so. Theperception of its value, and so its ability to purchase, comes from theperception of its value. This perception is embedded in the human psyche bythose that control and report the system. A currency can be made to leap orcrash in perceived value simply by circulating a rumour of an economic positiveor negative. It doesn’t have to be true and often isn’t because the manipulatorsknow that the value of money is not a reality that becomes a perception but aperception that becomes a reality. Put it in the mind and you put it in thepocket. What we call money is known as a ‘fiat’ currency. The definition of fiatis: ‘Paper money or coins of little or no intrinsic value in themselves and notconvertible into gold or silver, but made legal tender by fiat (order) of thegovernment.’ The term fiat comes from the Latin meaning of ‘Let it be done’, ‘Itshall be’. This nicely describes the process in which money with no value isgiven the perception of value because governments say it has value. Yes, thesame governments owned the Archon networks that also own the banks and financialhouses (Fig 582). The currency for economic interaction was once something ofvalue to the receiver – anything from gold to guns to furs. It was based on‘I’ll give you this is return for you giving me that’. Then paper money wasintroduced, but its value was still backed by the ability to convert it intogold at a fixed price whenever you wanted. The third stage was the one thatlaunched today’s economic madness and free for all when paper money became thecurrency, but was backed by nothing (Fig 583). Its value was all in the mind ina whole new way and this has become even more extreme by the rapid replacementof worthless paper money with worthless digital money. The transition made oneof its biggest steps in this Totalitarian Tiptoe with the Bretton WoodsAgreement in 1944 when the engineered World War II was used as theProblem-Reaction-Solution to impose a new global economic order that handed theworld and lives of the masses to a handful of bankers in theRothschild-Rockefeller financial cartel. Delegates from 44 ‘victorious’ Alliedcountries met at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, toagree ‘a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relationsamong independent nation-states’. The gathering also established theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstructionand Development which is now part of today’s World Bank. The centralisation ofglobal financial control had taken a giant leap overnight and when President‘crooked-to-his-fingernails’ Nixon (and his handler Henry Kissinger) ended theconvertibility of the dollar into gold in 1971 the worldwide fiat money systemhad arrived.[../Images/00324.jpg]Figure 582: These are some I made earlier.[../Images/00344.jpg]Figure 583: Not worth shit – unless we believe it is.‘Banking’: lending people ‘money’ that doesn’t existWorthless fiat money goes hand in hand with fractional reserve lending whichallows banks to lend ‘money’ that doesn’t exist and charge interest on it. Thiscriminal activity is perfectly ‘legal’ because ‘... you can turn any criminalorganisation into a political [or financial] one by simply legalising everycrime you’re going to commit’. The Archon networks that control the banking andpolitical systems had their governments pass laws that allowed banks to lend atleast ten times what they have on deposit or in reserve – hence it is calledfractional reserve lending. This means that every time you put a dollartheoretically into a bank you are giving the bank the right to lend another nineor ten that it doesn’t have and charge interest on it (far more than that inreality). This is how ‘money’ is created. It is private banks overwhelmingly andnot governments that put money into circulation by making loans of non-existent‘money’ called ‘credit’. These money-creating banks are ultimately controlled bythe same Archontic networks and this means that the Archons and their bloodlinescan create economic booms or busts at will by creating more money or removing itfrom circulation (as in the ‘credit crunch’ after the engineered crash of 2008).This is what we call the economic system: When people and businesses go to abank for a loan, say $50,000, where does the ‘money’ come from? It is manifestedout of fresh air by typing into your account $50,000. That’s it. The banks canlend around ten dollars – at least – for every one they have on deposit and sothe bank does not have to own the $50,000 to lend it to you. It is all agigantic conjuring trick and based on ‘lending’ nonexistent money called‘credit’ (Fig 584). From the moment that you have the $50,000 keyed into yourcomputer account you become liable to paying back that money which has neverexisted, plus interest. Should the borrower be unable to do that at some pointbecause of a lost job and (bank-induced) economic downturn then the bank getswhatever assets they gave as collateral for the non-existent loan – their home,business, car, land, farm and so on. The Archon banking system has in this waystolen – ‘legally’ – much of the wealth of the world in return for worthlesspaper and computer codes. This makes banking the most potent example of what theArchons are: parasites. They feed off the efforts and creativity of others andsteal that energy in the form ‘money’. But there’s more. When people spend theirloan, say $10,000 of the original $50,000 to buy a car, the receiver of that‘money’ (non-existent credit, remember) deposits the $10,000 with his or herbank. Now the second bank can lend ten times the $10,000 which came from theoriginal $50,000 that was conjured out of nothing as credit in the first place.Every loan goes on creating more and more non-existent credit for as long as itcontinues to circulate the banking system. When people ‘buy’ a house with amortgage the bank is lending them non-existent credit or figures on a screen.The seller of the house has those figures transferred to their screen and thenthey are transferred again to the screen of the seller of new house that theyare ‘buying’. That’s all a mortgage is – figures circulating between computerprograms. Ask most economists and television financial correspondents and‘experts’ how money is created and they will look at you with blank eyes or giveyou some bullshit story that isn’t true. I know because I have tried it over theyears.[../Images/00190.jpg]Figure 584: A banker at work.Not only is there still more but it gets worse and even more outrageous. Whenthe bank gives you a non-existent loan of non-existent credit you are pledged topay back the principle and the interest. The problem is the interest is nevercreated only the principle – in this case $50,000. This means that by cold andcalculated design there is never anything like enough units of theoreticalexchange in circulation to pay back all the outstanding debt plus interest.People losing their homes, businesses, livelihoods and ability to feedthemselves and their families is built into to the system. During an economicboom created through an expansion of credit Peter paying Paul hides the extentof the difference between money in circulation and outstanding debt; but oncethere is an economic downturn when the issuing of credit is suppressed the truthbecomes painfully obvious in lost homes and businesses and shattered lives. Thisis happening in ever greater extremes today. Governments are owned by the banksbecause they, too, have long been caught on purpose in the cycle of borrowingcredit ‘money’ from the Archon banking system and committing the taxpayers topay it back with interest. But they can’t pay it back because the system ismanipulated to prevent this and so debt is followed by even more debt. Americangovernment debt has now passed $16 trillion and is projected to be $20 trillionby 2016. Britain with its far smaller economy is in excess of a trillion poundsin debt – more than $1.5 trillion. Neither is anything like a true indication ofthe true debt, most of which is hidden behind smoke and mirrors. There is no waythat this can ever be repaid and nor does the banking system want it to bebecause debt means power and control over the debtor. People sell possessionswhen they have debt they can’t pay and so do governments which is why we havehad such an orgy of worldwide state assets being sold at knockdown prices tocorporations owned by the same Archon networks that created the debt and theeconomic crash to dramatically increase the debt. Look at Greece alone. Anotherstage of financial takeover related to this is what has become known as the ‘IMFriot’ in which you make it so bad and untenable for the population that theyriot in protest. Investigative journalist Greg Palast leaked World Bankdocuments in 2001 which detailed a four-step process to asset-strip the wealth,infrastructure and resources of countries and one was to covertly instigatecivil unrest to create chaos and cause investors to withdraw and triggereconomic collapse and bankruptcy. This has been done in the developing worldmany times and they now want to do the same in the West. Palast said: ‘Thiseconomic arson has its bright side – for foreigners, who can then pick offremaining assets at fire sale prices.’ These various expressions of the samemanipulation have handed ownership of national energy and water supplies toforeign corporations over which the population has little control and if you godeep enough this transfer of wealth, resources and power is being transferred bypoliticians of the Archon networks to corporations of the Archon networks infull knowledge of what they are doing – see Thatcher, Blair, Cameron, Reagan,the Bushes, Clinton and Obama. Corporate state asset-stripping under Thatcherbecame known as ‘privatisation’ and the major company administering the saleswas ... N M Rothschild.Governments also say that they have to cut back welfare and other spending andimpose austerity programmes to repay the debt to private banks and otherslending fresh air money that doesn’t exist. Debt is power and control to theArchons and they want as much of it as possible. This is the motivation behindthe crippling student debt that will dictate the lives and choices of youngpeople for at least most of the rest of their lives. Wars are fantasticaccumulators of un-repayable debt. The Rothschild networks that control thebanks engineer wars through their puppet politicians and terror groups. Thebanks lend massive sums to fund the wars and the same networks get the same‘money’ back – and more – by selling the countries weapons made by theirarmament corporations and through contracts for their private security companiesand mercenaries. When the weapons have destroyed the infrastructure of a countrythe banks lend more ‘money’ for reconstruction and that largely goes tocorporations owned by the same networks. Wars are a stunning transfer of wealthfrom the populations of countries at war to the Archons networks that engineerthe wars. The same happens with ‘overseas aid’ when taxpayer money is given toother countries but with the agreement that will be spent with certain Archonticcorporations. Why do governments borrow money at interest from the Archonticprivate banks when they could issue their own currency interest free? The answerby now is obvious. Interestfree money would be of fundamental benefit to peopleand seriously mute the power of the banks. It doesn’t happen because those thatcontrol the banks control the governments. American President Abraham Lincolnwas in the process of issuing interest-free money known as greenbacks when hewas assassinated.Control the economy? Child’s playAllowing banks to create the money supply has many serious consequencesincluding the fact that the very unit of exchange starts out life as aninterest-bearing debt. Money is just another word for debt in so many ways andit cannot pay back debt because it is debt and has been from the moment it wasissued. British notes have printed on them: ‘I promise to pay the bearer the sumon demand’ of whatever the alleged value is. The note is not the repayment ofdebt, but an IOU promising to pay if you demand it. But even if someone doesmake this demand there is no money which is not debt to pay them with. It wasonce said that the promise to pay on demand referred to being able to exchangethe note for gold or coinage, but that no longer applies. It is now a promise topay but with nothing to pay with. Money is a debt promising to pay a debt with adebt. Another foundation effect of having private banks create ‘money’ throughthe issuing of credit is this gives them total control over whether an economy,local, national or global, is expanding or contracting. This is the mosteffective way that the Archons have stolen the wealth and resources of theworld. Economists call this the boom and bust cycle as if it was some naturaloccurrence, but it is all manipulated. Pouring non-existent credit ‘money’ intocirculation also creates inflation which reduces the buying power and worth ofits illusory ‘value’ and so £100 today had the purchasing power of £299 asrecently as 1982 while the cost of necessities and basics has comparativelyincreased. No wonder people are finding it harder and harder to pay their billsand feed their families. This global organised crime of credit creation givesthe Archon banking system total control over governments and the world economythrough the following repeating sequence:> • The banking system pours lots of money into the economy by making lots of> loans at low (though variable) interest rates. The variable rates mean that> you are borrowing blind as well as being robbed blind because you have no idea> what future repayments might turn out to be.> • With lots of theoretical units of exchange in circulation the credit is> available for people to buy and generate an expansion of economic activity> which leads to more demand and production and more employment and profits.> • Business and people tend to get into more debt in these boom periods with> the confidence of full order books and apparently secure jobs. Business> borrows more for new plant and machinery to meet demand and people will borrow> more for homes, cars and holidays.> • Then at the optimum point from the Archon network’s point of view an excuse> is found to stem the flow of credit into the economy and/or increase interest> rates. Both have the effect of taking money out of circulation, and demand for> goods and services begins to fall.> • Businesses start to fail because they are not generating the income to pay> their costs and bank debt. People lose their jobs and can no longer pay the> debt on their homes, cars and other possessions. This is what they call a> slump or recession.> • Now the banks take the real wealth in property, land, farms and resources> from those who cannot repay principle and interest on credit ‘money’ that does> not and will never exist.This cycle has been played over and over for centuries by the banks to suck upthe wealth of the world and we are currently in the midst of a coldly-engineeredperfect storm which they plan to continue until humanity is in mass and abjectpoverty on a scale never seen before. If people sit around waiting for aneconomic turnaround they will wait until they sit in a debtor’s prison becausethe Archons are going for the winning post this time. People overwhelminglydon’t lose their homes and livelihoods because they refuse to work, but becausethere is not enough economic activity to allow them to work. The obsession withwork, work, work, often just to survive, is another Archon program encoded inthe Matrix. The game plan was described by Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812),the founder of the dynasty, who is quoted to have said: ‘Let me issue andcontrol a nation’s money and I care not who makes its laws.’ His son, NathanRothschild (1777-1836), who built the British arm of the dynasty, said somethingsimilar: ‘I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule theEmpire. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empireand I control the British money supply.’ The money system completely distortshuman society in the most fundamental ways including the suppression of humantalents and abilities. How many people have talents and gifts that would be ofgreat benefit to the community but they can’t use them because there is no moneyto pay them? Okay, you might say, they should do it for nothing, but they oftencan’t give their time because they are too busy trying to make a living doingwhat the system demands rather than what they really want to do with their livesand abilities. How many times do you hear ‘I would love to do this or that withmy life, but I can’t because I don’t have the money’? How many charityorganisations would like to help needy and desperate people but cannot do sobecause they don’t have the money? People go hungry, even starve, through lackof money when food is plentiful. They are left to freeze in the cold when energyis available but they don’t have the money to pay for it. Look at all thehomeless people and families and look at all the empty homes just standing theredoing nothing since the banks foreclosed, and what keeps one from the other ismoney that does not and will never exist (Fig 585). A Conscious society would beoutraged by this, but most are not so because they are programmed to believe‘that’s the way it is’. But it doesn’t have to be. It is purposely made thatway. Control the flow of non-existent credit and you control global humansociety. Crazy, but true. The whole system is rigged with stock markets playedlike a yo-yo by Archontic networks through the trillions they move around thefinancial system every day. They invest and the markets go up and they withdrawand the markets go down. Control of the programmed and unquestioning mainstreamfinancial media means that rumours and crises can be triggered at will.Investment is all about confidence. If you damage that confidence with fakerumours and artificial crises you generate the panic that brings about a crash.The Archon families have also absorbed the wealth of the world by selling sharesat the peak of the market (which they inflated) and then buying at the low ofthe market after one of their engineered economic crises. Winning on the stockmarkets is hardly difficult when you know when they are going to rise and fallbecause you are making that happen.[../Images/00272.jpg]Figure 585: Banking greed and manipulation have devastated the lives ofbillions.Some history ...Banking takes us back once again to the usual suspects. Temple priests weremaking loans in Babylon in the 18th century BC and by 1000 BC transferring bankdeposits to third parties was common. Later the Knights Templar ran majorfinancial centres in London and Paris and Archontic bloodlines in Venice andnorthern Italy known as the Black Nobility were centrally involved in thecreation of the modern banking system. These included infamous Satanists likethe de Medici family and they established financial centres of Lombardy innorthern Italy. This is where the association between banking and the wordLombard comes from. ‘Lombards’ became the term used for all bankers in Florence,Genoa, Venice and Milan. The word ‘bank’ comes from ‘banco’, meaning ‘bench’,and refers to the benches that the moneychangers sat upon while doing theirbusiness. Judges and magistrates are also known today as ‘the bench’ and this isconnected to the common Archontic control and mutual origins of banks andjudiciary. The Black Nobility expanded their banking empire into Germany, theNetherlands and London where they in part created The City and one of itsbest-known thoroughfares, near the Bank of England, is still called LombardStreet. There are extremely close connections between the bloodlines of Italyand the Roman Church and the former Khazars that I call Rothschild Zionists. Inmany ways they are different expressions of the same thing. The Rothschildsbecame ‘guardians of the papal treasure’ according to the Jewish Encyclopaediaof 1906. Terms like Jewish and Roman Catholic are very misleading in the upperlevels of the Archon networks because they are all on the same team andultimately have the same genetic origin. I smile when I hear conspiracyresearchers arguing over whether it is a Zionist or Jesuit plot and evencondemning each other for believing it is one or the other. They are masks onthe same face working to the same end. You will quite often find Archonoperatives who are born Jewish but become Roman Catholics to be trained andeducated (programmed) by the Jesuits. Adam Weishaupt was a founder for theRothschilds of the Bavarian Illuminati in 1776, a secret society behind theFrench Revolution. Weishaupt was born Jewish but educated at a Jesuit school inGermany. The origin of worthless paper currency can be traced to former Khazarsfrom the Caucasus and Sumer/Babylon who were gold and silversmiths in RothschildGermany. This is why Goldschmidt or Goldsmith became a common Jewish name. The‘smiths’ began to issue notes confirming ownership of gold and silver in theirvaults when transactions took place rather than physically moving the metalsaround. They realised that only a certain amount of the gold and silver came andwent from the vaults and they began to issue paper notes to people who did notown any gold or silver and charge them interest on it. They were lending thewealth of others to make fortunes for themselves and in doing so they wereparasitizing once again. They could get away with this so long as they didn’tissue ownership certificates at a rate that exceeded the amount of gold that thetrue owners were likely to want to physically withdraw. This is the techniquenow known as fractional reserve lending. The Judaism-converted Khazars had acrucial advantage when it came to banking and that was ‘usury’ which is MedievalLatin for ‘interest’ or ‘excessive interest’. Usury was banned in the Christianworld at one time and, at least officially, remains so within Islam. The Jewishreligion did not ban usury and the ability to charge interest or excessiveinterest gave the former Khazars the game-winner that allowed them to dominatethe banking arena. The most successful of them was a German Khazar or AshkenaziJewish family called Bauer who changed their name to Rothschild in honour of theSaturn symbol on their home in Frankfurt. The Rothschilds and their circle ofGerman Jewish banking families such as Schiff, Kuhn, Loeb, Speyer, Warburg,Goldman, Lazard and Lehman moved in on the United States to create the bankingsystem that today controls much of human society. They joined forces with theRockefellers, another German Jewish family, and built American’s banking,industrial and corporate power structure that now manifests as Morgan Stanley,JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and the rest of Big Banking, Big Biotech, Big Pharma,Big Oil, Big Food, Big Media and Big Government.[../Images/00429.jpg]Figure 586: The privately-owned Federal Reserve is a law unto itself.Their vice-like grip on the US Government and banking system came when theyestablished the privately-owned (Rothschild-owned) Federal Reserve which ishilariously called American’s Central Bank. It is not. The ‘Fed’ is a cartel ofprivate banks, all controlled by the same networks, and it runs the UnitedStates entirely for Archontic interests (Fig 586). Jacob Schiff and PaulWarburg, German Zionists and Rothschild associates, were instrumental inmanipulating the Federal Reserve into existence thanks to a bill passed onChristmas Eve 1913 when most members of Congress were not there. It was steeredthrough by Congressman Nelson Aldrich who had married into the Rockefeller clan.The Schiff family lived with the Rothschilds at their Saturn-symbol home inFrankfurt and Warburg’s brother Felix, even though Jewish, was a banker toHitler. Schiff and Paul Warburg ran the Rothschild New York financial houseKuhn, Loeb and Company which funded the Russian Revolution led by Vladimir Lenin(Rothschild Zionist) and Leon Trotsky (Rothschild Zionist). The Federal Reservehas since ‘lent’ the US Government worthless printed money and credit thatdoesn’t exist – plus interest – and continues to be owned by the Rothschilds andassociated Rothschild Zionist banking families. The purchasing power of thedollar has plummeted since the creation of the Fed while debt and inflation haveabsolutely soared (Fig 587). The Fed hijacked America with the intention ofdestroying America and it is almost there. The Archon bloodlines love centralbanks because they are what they say – central. They are an accumulation andconcentration of power over banking and finance in every country and if you canconnect them in terms of policy you can dictate global finance on that levelalone even without your additional control of stock markets. I am hardly goingto surprise anyone who has read this far to say that national central banks areconnected and coordinated through a range of organisations like theRothschild-created Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel,Switzerland, with branches in Hong Kong and Mexico City. This officially‘fosters international monetary and financial cooperation and serves as a bankfor central banks’, but is not accountable to any government. It might be worthreading that last sentence again to let it sink in. The BIS is not subject toany taxation or national laws and achieved infamy with the few who know bylaundering money for the Nazi regime during World War II (Fig 588). The heads ofthe major central banks meet every two months in Basel to plot the Archonticcourse of the world economy. The Wall Street Journal said of the BIS in 2012:‘While many national governments, including the US, have failed to agree onfiscal policy – how best to balance tax revenues with spending during slowgrowth – the central bankers have forged their own path, independent of votersand politicians, bound by frequent conversations and relationships stretchingback to university days.’ The connections are much deeper than university daysand extend deep into the Rothschild networks which also operate within academicinstitutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and theFabian Society created-and-controlled London School of Economics (LSE). I haveexplained the LSE background in detail in Human Race Get Off Your Knees. Leadingbankers and central bankers at the time of writing are Stanley Fischer (LondonSchool of Economics, MIT), governor of the Bank of Israel and former chiefeconomist at the World Bank; Mervyn King (London School of Economics, MIT), theoutgoing governor of the Bank of England, who was visiting professor at MITwhere he shared an office with then Assistant Professor Ben Bernanke, now headof the US Federal Reserve; Mario Draghi (MIT), president of the European CentralBank and ‘former’ Goldman Sachs executive; and Jeremy Stein (MIT) who is on theBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Many other central bankersworldwide have MIT connections along with the Deputy Governor of the Bank ofEngland Charles Bean (former head of economics at the London School ofEconomics) and many leading officials of the US Federal Reserve. Rothschildgofer and multi-billionaire George Soros also attended the London School ofEconomics.[../Images/00297.jpg]Figure 587: Earning ‘more’, but buying less.[../Images/00206.jpg]Figure 588: The Bank of International Manipulation in Switzerland.There are other central bank coordination groupings, too, including the Group ofThirty, also known as the G30, which replaced the Bellagio Group of RothschildZionist economist Fritz Machlup, who became a member of the G30. Once again wefind the same names manipulating away. The Group of Thirty was founded in 1978by its current executive secretary Geoffrey Bell at the invitation of theRothschild Zionist Rockefeller Foundation. The group’s first chairman was JohanWitteveen (Rothschild Zionist), former managing director of the RothschildInternational Monetary Fund, and the current chairman is Jean-Claude Trichet(Rothschild Zionist), former chairman of the European Central Bank before MarioDraghi and a member of the board of the Bank for International Settlements. Thechairman of the Board of Trustees for the Group of Thirty is Jacob AharonFrenkel (Rothschild Zionist), an Israeli economist and former governor of theBank of Israel who became chairman of JPMorgan Chase International. The G30chairman emeritus is Paul Adolph Volcker, a business partner of the Rothschildswho has a long and very close relationship with the Rockefeller family throughpositions at Chase Bank and the Trilateral Commission and his membership of thetrust committee of Rockefeller Group. Volcker is a founding member of theRockefeller/Brzezinskiestablished Trilateral Commission, a long-time member ofthe Bilderberg Group through which global financial policy is also coordinated,and he attended the London School of Economics. Volcker (Rothschild Zionist) waschairman of the US Federal Reserve at the time of Jimmy Carter and Reagan-Bushbetween 1979 and 1987. He was followed by Alan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist)from the end of Reagan-Bush, through the Father Bush and Clinton presidenciesand for most of the Boy Bush years between 1987 and 2006; and then came BernardBernanke (Rothschild Zionist, London School of Economics, MIT) from 2006 topresent day (Fig 589). When you research the maze of financial and othernetworks, as I have for a quarter of a century and published in other books, thesame names appear over and over and the two main ones, at least at the level ofpublic identity, are Rothschild and Rockefeller. The Rothschilds have holdingsestimated by Credit Suisse to be $231 trillion and they own the national andcentral banks except for two or three, including Iran. There were seven before9/11 but no longer are they to be found in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq andLibya. How blatant it all is. Islam forbids the charging of usury or excessiveinterest and that is the very lifeblood of the Rothschild method of operation.Insider Carrol Quigley (1910-1977) was an American historian and professor atGeorgetown University who taught Bill Clinton and was given access to documentsdetailing the global financial and political conspiracy. He published thebackground in two major books, Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in OurTime and The Anglo-American Establishment. He wrote in Tragedy and Hope: ‘Thepowers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than tocreate a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate thepolitical system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.’President Woodrow Wilson is reported to have said something similar after heoversaw the introduction of the Federal Reserve through the manipulations of hishandlers and Rothschild agents Colonel Edward Mandel House (Rothschild Zionist)and Bernard Baruch (Rothschild Zionist). See ... And The Truth Shall Set YouFree for the detailed background. President Wilson said that House was ‘mysecond personality’, ‘my alterego’ and ‘his thoughts and mine are one’. Houseand Baruch were behind Wilson’s decision to enter the First World War and werethe president’s advisors (controllers) at the Versailles Peace Conference in1919 when Europe’s future was decided in the wake of the war(Problem-Reaction-Solution). Wilson realised too late what had happened andwould describe how ‘a little group of wilful men, representing no opinion buttheir own, have rendered the great government of the United States helpless andcontemptible’. The European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and WorldBank are all strands in this web of financial deceit and control and thenetworks moved as one unit to bring about the crash of 2008 and the stunningtransfer of wealth from the global population via governments to banks and theirArchontic owners.[../Images/00037.jpg]Figure 589: Greenspan and his lapdog Bernanke –Rothschild Zionists controllingthe Fed.Dash to crashThe momentum for the long-planned crash began when Alan Greenspan (RothschildZionist) took over the Federal Reserve in 1987 and began to systematicallydismantle checks and balances in financial regulation which allowed for alegally-supported freefor-all that was designed to end in tears for thepopulation although not the major banks (Fig 590). He was supported in thispolicy by President Clinton’s Treasury Secretaries, Robert E Rubin (RothschildZionist, London School of Economics); Larry Summers (Rothschild Zionist, LondonSchool of Economics, MIT), former co-chairman of the Rothschild-controlledGoldman Sachs, vicious foul-mouthed thug and former chief economist at the WorldBank; and Peter Orszag (Rothschild Zionist, London School of Economics), BillClinton’s Special Assistant for Economic Policy and Senior Economist and SeniorAdviser on the Council of Economic Advisers. Brooksley Born, the head a minorgovernment financial agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, sought toexpose the madness of deregulation and where it would enviably lead but she wasforced from office in a campaign of vilification led by Greenspan, Summers,Rubin and other exponents of intimidation and thuggery (see Remember Who YouAre). The crash was not going to be stopped because it was an essential part ofthe long term plan for human enslavement. Other members of the deregulation gangwere Timothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist), an assistant to Treasury SecretaryRobert Rubin (Rothschild Zionist) and president of the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York, the most powerful in the Fed cartel; and Arthur Levitt (RothschildZionist), the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which issupposed to be a body of financial regulation. Geithner was also employed forthree years by the infamous Kissinger Associates to which no-one with even afragment of integrity need apply. To give you a feel for this operation it wasKissinger who said in cables published by WikiLeaks that ‘the illegal we doimmediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer’.’ The Archons cover allbases and genuine people like Brooksley Born are rare and getting rarer. GaryGensler (Rothschild Zionist), who spent 18 years at Rothschild Zionist GoldmanSachs, became head of Born’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission when she wasforced out to stop any more challenges from that direction. The deregulationpolicy was being mirrored in the United Kingdom by Rothschild Zionist poodles,Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor Gordon Brown, just as RonaldReagan’s ‘Reaganomics’ in the 1980s was mirrored by Margaret Thatcher’s‘Thatcherism’. It is all coordinated and planned long before it happens.Thatcherism was hatched by the Centre for Policy Studies, the think-tank thatshe co-founded with Sir Keith Joseph (Rothschild Zionist) and Alfred Sherman(Rothschild Zionist) while Reaganomics was inspired by his economics advisorMilton Friedman (Rothschild Zionist), the American economist from the Universityof Chicago. Alan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist) left in Fed in 2006 so that BenBernanke (Rothschild Zionist) would face the flack when the crash Greenspan knewwas coming duly arrived in 2008. Greenspan was rewarded for his efforts onbehalf of the Archontic families by being awarded America’s highest civilianhonour, the Congressional Gold Medal. So the major architects of the worldeconomic crash of 2008 that has caused such depths of suffering and mayhem wereAlan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist) and those in his support team includingRobert Rubin (Rothschild Zionist), Larry Summers (Rothschild Zionist) andTimothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist). Summers and Geithner were known as‘Rubin’s poodles’. But never mind, the Golden Boy, the Great ‘Hope’, the GreatSaviour, was soon coming in at the election in November 2008. Barack Obama wasdifferent – he will sort them out. He was a man of justice, kindness ... er,peace. Alas, such fantasies were only for the programmed and naïve. In realityanother mask on the one-party state was about to continue what he had opposed(but only verbally) to secure office. Obama immediately set about naming hiseconomic team to repair the devastation left by the above-listed crooks andconmen. This was the ‘team’ that he chose, or rather had chosen for him: TimothyGeithner (Rothschild Zionist) was made treasury secretary; Larry Summers(Rothschild Zionist) was appointed director of the White House National EconomicCouncil; and Paul Adolph Volcker (Rothschild Zionist), a Rothschild businesspartner, was made chairman of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Othermembers of this Rothschild Zionist coup included:[../Images/00154.jpg]Figure 590: Greenspan made things disappear, like homes, jobs and livelihoods.Peter Orszag (Rothschild Zionist), director of the Office of Management andBudget; Jared Bernstein (Rothschild Zionist), chief economist and economicpolicy adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden; Mary Schapiro (RothschildZionist), chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Gary Gensler(Rothschild Zionist), chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC); Sheila Bair (Rothschild Zionist), chairman of the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC); and Karen Mills (Rothschild Zionist), head of theSmall Business Administration (SBA).[../Images/00189.jpg]Figure 591: The way to put out a fire is to pour more petrol on it.No doubt Obama was well advised on who to pick by his White House Chief of StaffRahm Emanuel (Rothschild Zionist) and his Senior White House Advisor andelection campaign coordinator, David Axelrod (Rothschild Zionist). The Jewishpopulation of the United States is less than two percent of Americans and theRothschild Zionists among them even less. There’s no conspiracy? My god. Denialis a terminal disease. Obama also nominated Chicago mogul, long-time friend andRothschild Zionist billionaire Penny Pritzker as his Commerce Secretary in 2013.Pritzker, from the family that owns Hyatt hotels, raised millions for Obama’spolitical campaigns from the time that he ran for the Senate in 2004 and she wasnational chair of his campaign finance team for the 2008 presidential electionin which the money raised shattered all records. The Rothschild Zionistsdesperately wanted this guy. As an added bonus, Pritzker had personal experienceof guiding a bank into oblivion when her Superior Bank in Chicago went bust in2001 because of ‘predatory, deceitful, racist tactics and practices’ and thePritzker family was fined $460 million. Superior was the first of thederegulated banks to crash and it was the forerunner of what happened in 2008.US taxpayers lost almost half a billion dollars while depositors, many of thempoor people from Obama’s district, lost their homes. But then he nominatesRothschild Zionist Pritzker for US Commerce Secretary. This man is such a fraudand a crook that words lose their meaning. When the crash happened in 2008 thecabal already had their Goldman Sachs man Hank Paulson as the Boy Bush treasurysecretary to ensure that their engineered problem would be met by the desiredsolution – trillions of dollars in the form of taxation and debt transferredfrom the people to the banks that had caused the crash via governments owned bythe same network that own the banks. Paulson had left his job as CEO ofRothschild Zionist Goldman Sachs, a major instigator of the crisis, to becomeBush Treasury Secretary in 2006 to prepare for the economic Armageddon plannedfor two years later. When it happened the ‘solution’ was all ready to go asmoney was hosed in all directions to ‘bail out the banks’ that are ‘too big tofail’ (Fig 591). As pig troughs go I doubt it has yet been eclipsed withunimaginable sums handed to the banking and financial system includingRothschild-controlled banks and insurance companies like Citigroup, JP Morgan,Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group (of course), AIG and somany others. Citigroup (advised to disaster by Rothschild Zionist and crasharchitect Robert E Rubin) received $100 billion in taxpayer bailouts to stayafloat while the population went under. Goldman Sachs took that taxpayer moneydespite being a major cause of the crisis and despite making $4 billion inprofit by betting on a collapse in the sub-prime mortgage market (basicallypeople given loans that they couldn’t pay back). Here’s a headline for you:‘Federal Reserve Board Members Gave Their Own Banks $4 Trillion in Bailouts.’This was the revelation that after the crash of 2008 the Federal Reserve gavemore than $4 trillion in zero or near zero-interest loans and other support tobanks and businesses which had executives serving as directors of ... theFederal Reserve (Fig 592). What can you say in the face of such corruption andcallous disregard for the population? Senator Bernie Sanders, one of the fewwith the integrity to expose the financial outrage, released the report compiledby the Government Accountability Office. Sanders said:[../Images/00227.jpg]Figure 592: America destroyed by the Rothschild Zionist bankers while the worldlooked on.> This report reveals the inherent conflicts of interest that exist at the> Federal Reserve. At a time when small businesses could not get affordable> loans to create jobs, the Fed was providing trillions in secret loans to some> of the largest banks and corporations in America that were well represented on> the boards of the Federal Reserve Banks.Sanders highlighted the appalling Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer ofJPMorgan Chase, who was part of the Fed leadership that agreed $391 billion inemergency funds to JPMorgan Chase. Then there was Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GeneralElectric, a member of the New York Federal Reserve that created the CommercialPaper Funding Facility which then lent $16 billion to ... General Electric. Butthese people have such conscious schizophrenia that they can do this and thenlecture others on ethics. Mario Monti, the Goldman Sachs executive who becamethe unelected technocrat prime minister of Italy, said that the response to acorruption scandal in Italian football should be to close the game down for twoto three years. He said: ‘In recent years we have seen so many shamefulphenomena: we have recently witnessed an invisible blackmail of [a code ofsilence], with the players of Genoa kneeling down in the face of who knows whatkind of threats from hidden forces, and I also find it unacceptable that publicmoney has been used, and is still being used, to settle the debts of footballclubs.’ Monti said that without choking which is miraculous in itself to me. Nomatter what the level of corruption in Italian football it is eclipsed byMonti’s global banking system about every ten seconds and as for hidden forces,invisible blackmail, codes of silence and private debt paid by public money,don’t get me started. Once Bush and Paulson had got the bankfest underway incame Obama and his Rothschild Zionists to not only continue this policy ofhanding trillions in public taxation and debt to the banking system but tomassively expand it by employing the very people that had caused the crash.Peter Orszag (Rothschild Zionist, London School of Economics) was in charge ofall government spending as budget director. Orszag was the founder and presidentof the economic consultancy firm which advised the Central Bank of Iceland inthe period before it went bankrupt and advised the Russian Ministry of Financewhen the country’s resource assets were being given away to Rothschild Zionistoligarchs like Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich to make them instantbillionaires. Orszag also worked closely with Rahm Emanuel (Rothschild Zionist)to impose the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which has purposelydemolished American industry along with other calculated legislation. Orszagresigned as budget director in 2010 and was replaced by Jacob Lew (RothschildZionist) who was returning to the post that he held under President Clinton.Obama announced at the start of his second term that Lew (Rothschild Zionist)would be the new treasury secretary after Timothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist)left to re-join the Rothschild-Rockefeller Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) asa distinguished fellow (inversion). ‘We are thrilled to welcome Tim back to theCouncil on Foreign Relations’, said Rothschild Zionist CFR President Richard NHaass, a Rhodes Scholar; former Department of Defense special assistant toPresident Father Bush; National Security Council senior director for Near Eastand South Asian Affairs; vice president and director of Foreign Policy Studiesat the Brookings Institution; senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace (inversion); and research associate at the InternationalInstitute for Strategic Studies. Talk about Archontic Man. Haass was obviouslytaking the piss when he said of Geithner: ‘Both at the Treasury and at the NewYork Federal Reserve, Tim was a tireless, creative, and responsible custodian ofthe public trust’ (inversion).Whys and whereforesThere were two main reasons for the engineered crash and endless other offshootbenefits for human enslavement factored into their plans. One was to transformthe economic and political order ever closer to their goal of a worldgovernment, world central bank, world army and single electronic world currency.The Vatican and Rothschild assets like financier and fake-revolution manipulatorGeorge Soros (Rothschild Zionist) were soon calling for a world government andcentral bank to ‘solve the problem’ which the forces they serve had purposelycaused. The single electronic currency within a cashless society is a foundationplan for human control. Barter will be the only means of purchase once cash hasgone should the computer system say no to your card or microchip as it isplanned to be eventually. You will see efforts to outlaw barter on the groundsof losing taxation revenue to stop even that. The euro single currencythroughout most of the European Union was never an end in itself. It was merelya stalking horse to delete all the individual currencies that preceded it suchas the franc, guilder, mark and lira. The euro, too, is due to be replaced bythe global single electronic currency and the euro crisis serves that aim. Thenetworks are coordinating this cash-free policy all over the world that has beenin the pipeline for at least many decades and in reality far longer. Sweden isone country that is virtually cash-free already and Italy’s unelected banker-ledCouncil of Ministers announced that cash transactions will be limited to 50euros from 2013. The Council was headed by Prime Minister Mario Monti, aEuropean chairman of the Trilateral Commission, leading member of the exclusiveBilderberg Group and international advisor to Goldman Sachs and Coca Cola. Heand his unelected government of technocrats (see Brzezinski’s book) wasappointed in the face of Italy’s engineered debt crisis(Problem-Reaction-Solution). Spain and many other countries are limiting cashtransactions and this is planned to happen everywhere. I have been predictingthis in my books since the early 1990s and now you are seeing all sorts ofadvertisements, open and subliminal, incentives and technology like the ‘GoogleWallet’ pushing this agenda (Fig 593). The plan is to make it more and moredifficult to use cash with the law being employed to impose maximum hassle. AFlorida court ruled that it was perfectly fine for employees at state tollbooths to detain drivers paying with cash until the collector has filled in a‘Bill Detection Report’ with the car registration and driver’s personal details.This is for payments with bills as small as $5. It is all about bringing in thecashless society because cashless = control. You need no further confirmation ofthe importance of this to the overall plan than that Bill Gates is promoting itsintroduction. This guy is seriously involved across the spectrum of Archonticgoals. An article in Bloomberg Businessweek quoted Gates as saying that he hatedcash ‘because of its effect on people at the opposite end of the wealth spectrum– the world’s poor and unbanked.’ Yes, multi-billionaire Gates cares about theworld’s poor just as he cares so much about the world’s poor children that hewants to destroy their immune systems with toxic vaccines. If Gates was onlybeing idiotic it would be bad enough, but this guy knows what he is doing. Imean, could anyone be so stupid as to say that the world’s poorest people, madepoor by banks and global corporations, are adversely affected by not being ableto bank?? Fake heart-on-the-sleeve Gates may fool the asleep but no one in anyway conscious. This is one arrogant and manipulating man. His Bill and MelindaGates Foundation is a major financial backer of the Better Than Cash Alliance –an organization dedicated to imposing the cashless society. It is supported bythe US government’s USAID and is described as ‘a global public-privatepartnership dedicated to supporting organizations transition away from cash toelectronic payments’. It is founded by Archontic organisations like The Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation, Citi, Ford Foundation, the Omidyar Network (eBayfounder Pierre Omidyar), UN Capital Development Fund and Visa Inc. What a scam.[../Images/00047.jpg]Figure 593: The cashless society means cashless control.The engineered crash in Europe and the ‘euro crisis’ has been used as planned asa Problem-Reaction-Solution to bring thousands of banks under the directsupervision of the Rothschild-created European Central Bank (ECB) in theRothschild family home city of Frankfurt, Germany. The ECB was headed at thetime of the 2008 crash and subsequent bank and national bailouts by Jean-ClaudeTrichet (Rothschild Zionist) who is now with the Group of Thirty and the Bankfor International Settlements. He is not known to breathe unless the Rothschildsgive him permission. The current president of the ECB is Mario Draghi, a vicechairman and managing director of Goldman Sachs International and a member ofits management committee. Draghi was with the firm while Goldman Sachs wasmanipulating events to hide the extent of Greek debt which eventually led to thecountry’s catastrophic collapse into extremes of poverty. Now as president ofthe ECB he dictates to Greece what they must and must not do in response to whatwas made to happen by the collusion of the Greek Government and Goldman Sachswhile Draghi was a leading executive. Investigative journalist Greg Palastexposed how Goldman Sachs secretly bought up €2.3 billion in Greek Governmentdebt, converted it into yen and dollars, then immediately sold it back toGreece. This was done at an apparent massive loss to Goldman Sachs but it wasdone to hide the extent of Greece’s enormous budget deficit and Goldman didn’tmake a loss at all because it was being paid a quarter of a billion dollars infees by the Greek Government for its manipulation. The cost of Goldman Sachscredit default swap insurance for bondholders exposed by the whole scamskyrocketed when news began to break of the basket-case nature of the Greekeconomy – caused by Goldman and the government. This meant even greater profitsfor Goldman Sachs and company as did betting on the Greek Government bonds tocollapse because they knew what was going on behind the secrecy. JPMorgan Chaseand a wide range of other banks were also involved in the manipulation thatbrought economic death, destruction and misery to Greece. How many others,including Britain, have been hiding debt in this and other ways with all theconsequence’s that must follow? Goldman Sachs is at the very centre of theglobal economic nightmare and its policy has been to cause the problem and thenmanipulate its people into the positions of political power to impose thesolutions that Goldman Sachs demands on behalf of its Archontic masters.Goldman’s actions in the Greek crisis led the elected government to fold and itwas replaced by unelected banker Lucas Papademos, a Goldman Sachs executive,vicepresident of the European Central Bank to Rothschild Zionist Jean-ClaudeTrichet, and a member of the Trilateral Commission. Mark Carney, the newgovernor of the Bank of England, former governor of the Bank of Canada andcurrent chairman of the G20’s Financial Stability Board, spent 13 years withGoldman Sachs working all over the world. This included Russia where Goldman wasadvising the government during a financial crisis while betting against thecountry’s ability to pay its debts, which it didn’t. This is precisely whatGoldman did in Greece. Former Goldman people are all over the place in positionsof decision-making and influence and, as with the CIA, you are never formerGoldman, just no longer officially employed by them. Goldman Sachs is headed byLloyd Blankfein (Rothschild Zionist) and was founded by Rothschild ZionistsMarcus Goldman and Samuel Sachs who both came from families that relocated toAmerica from Germany. The extraordinary transfer of debt from government toteetering mega banks soon had whole nations in financial crisis just as the planforesaw and then in came the European Central Bank, IMF and the World Bank tobail out the countries that had bailed out the banks. These three institutionsare controlled by the banking system which had been bailed out by thegovernments who were then bailed out by the European Central Bank, the IMF andthe World Bank. It is extraordinary what has been allowed to happen. Countriessuch as Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and many more were handed credit‘loans’ with strings attached which meant that the European Central Bank and IMFwere now running the countries in effect. These were the heads of those bankinginstitutions while this was happening: Rothschild Zionist Jean-Claude Trichet(ECB); Rothschild Zionist Dominique Strauss-Kahn (IMF); and Rothschild ZionistRobert B Zoellick (World Bank). Zoellick had replaced Rothschild Zionist PaulWolfowitz and both were neocons with the Project for the New American Century.Human catastropheThe crash was caused by removing regulation to allow the satanic levels of greedwithin the mentally-deranged banking and financial system to run riot with bonusincentives written into contracts to sell almost anything to anyone. Homemortgages and other loans were handed out like confetti to people who had nochance of repaying them, but the bonus was paid when the contract was signed nomatter if the loan was later defaulted as it was certain to do. Toxic mortgagesand loans that the banks accrued were sold on as triple-A safe with the help ofthe bank-controlled and funded ‘credit-ratings agencies’ Moody’s, Fitch andStandard & Poor’s which dominate the market. They gave the thumbs-up to totalshite, and pension funds and other organisations representing the ‘littlepeople’ bought them and lost a fortune for their clients. These are the sameratings agencies that have since been credit-rating countries – decisions thatcan, and have many times, brought nations to their knees through the effect of adowngrade on the ability to raise new funds and pay debts. The ratings agenciesare paid by the banks to rate their securities which presents a conflict ofinterest that beggars belief. This mayhem and madness has happened and is stillhappening with ‘money’ – credit – that has never, does not and will never exist.It is the same with the ‘Third World Debt’ that has crippled nations, broughtthem under the control of corporations, the IMF and World Bank, and killedhundreds and hundreds of millions of people. Iceland showed what could havehappened when its response to the Icelandic banking collapse was – thanks topeople power – to let the banks go to the wall and jail the guilty. As a result,Iceland has come through far more successfully than the rest of the world. TheArchontic plan is not for countries to come through the crisis, however, but togo ever deeper into the economic mire to crush people and force them intosubmission with homelessness, hunger and cold (Fig 594). We are having homelessand hungry people fined for looking through trash bins for something to eat andat the same time there are bans on feeding the hungry in public withoutpermission from the authorities. Both laws apply in the sick city of Houstonwhere a homeless and hungry man called James Kelly was fined for ‘disturbing thecontents of a garbage can in (the) downtown business district’. When the ownersof a store in Augusta, Georgia, were evicted by the SunTrust Bank in Atlantathey put the remaining food and other items in the car park for the hungry, butthen police turned up to stop hundreds of people getting to the food and had itdriven away to a land fill. The marshal of Richmond County, Steve Smith, said‘...we just have to make sure that it’s handled, disposed of by law’. The lawtrumps basic humanity every time. Only the Archontic mind would even considersuch things never mind implement them. The emergence so fast of the police stateis to meet the challenge of people resistance once enough realise what is goingon. The hungrier and more destitute people have become by then the lesseffective they are likely to be, or that’s the idea, anyway. The multi-trillionshanded to the banks and others could have been used to keep people in theirhomes, but instead it was used to throw them out amid millions and millions offoreclosures. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner (Rothschild Zionist), who wascentrally involved in handing that public money to his banking associates withno strings attached, asked the international Rothschild Zionist ‘law firm’Squire Sanders & Dempsey if American states could, as some requested, legallyuse bailout money or TARP to support the legal bills of people trying to protecttheir homes from foreclosure by the bailed-out banking system. Theprivately-owned Rothschild Zionist Squire Sanders & Dempsey said ‘no’, theycouldn’t, and so Geithner (Rothschild Zionist) said the money could not be usedto protect the public – the very public which had bailed out the banks – frombeing foreclosed by those same banks. US President Thomas Jeffersonprophetically said in 1809:[../Images/00294.jpg]Figure 594: The plan is to turn the screw on the entire population to force theminto mass submission.> If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their> currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks ... will deprive> the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the> continent their fathers conquered ... The issuing power should be taken from> the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.But it wasn’t and the rest is history and misery. Jefferson also said that hebelieved ‘that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties thanstanding armies.’ So this has proved to be. In fact, standing armies ‘stand’,conquer and kill in service to the banks which control their political leaders.Once again it was this combination of banks and their political stooges andservants that have relieved multi-millions of their homes since 2008. Many inthe United States were foreclosed by banks that didn’t even own the propertiessuch is the maze of debt-selling between banks and institutions. Even people whoowned their homes outright were getting foreclosure notices. Bank employees orcontractors were swearing in law that they had detailed knowledge of thousandsof mortgage documents presented for foreclosure every month when they had noteven read them. Bank employees used fake signatures known as ‘robo-signing’ tospeed the foreclosures and this led to an estimated hundreds of thousands offamilies fraudulently removed from their homes. The major mortgage ‘lenders’settled for $25 billion with 49 state attorney generals over the fraudulenthandling of foreclosures, but the deal gave defrauded homeowners an average ofonly $300 while the ‘consultants’ involved in the rigged investigation were paid$2 billion. Federal regulators also indicated that they would not hand overtheir evidence of illegal activity to homeowners seeking to sue the banks. Thesystem is rigged from top to bottom and you can see how deep the heartlessArchontic mentality has infiltrated human society. The bank and credit cardcompanies are doing the same in pursuing people through the courts for moneythey don’t owe. Noach Dear, a state civil court judge in Brooklyn who presidesover these cases every day, said: ‘I would say that roughly 90 percent of thecredit card lawsuits are flawed and can’t prove the person owes the debt.’ Yes,he said 90 percent. Bank contractors have been breaking into homes and changingthe locks, stealing and destroying belongings, even sometimes locking pets andpeople inside. Richard Fersch, a Pennsylvania sergeant in charge offoreclosures, said: ‘For some reason when these contractors ride by residencesand don’t see anyone home, they just jump the gun and change the locks.’ ‘Forsome reason’? The reason is that they are pond life serving the pond. Some 700members of the military were illegally evicted by the banks. This is what youare fighting for chaps. It’s funny how the foreclosures quickly reduced whenNevada made it a felony to file fraudulent mortgage foreclosures with thecourts, subject to 10 years in jail and fines of $10,000 per violation. Theyknew they were taking away the homes of families illegally and this is the scaleof callousness that we are dealing with (Fig 595). I would say that bankers areevil except that evil would probably sue me for defamation of character.Families have been thrown out of their homes in the middle of the night atgunpoint. This happened to Christine Frazer and her family in Atlanta when theDekalb County Sheriff’s department evicted them on the say so of Investors OneCorporation which was apparently the fourth company to buy their mortgage ineight months. Others like 62-year-old disabled veteran Ramsey Harris was leftoutside in the rain with everything he owned in a heap and valuables missing. ‘Iwas just broken-hearted’, he said. ‘I couldn’t believe what was happening to me... I ended up standing, watching all my life’s work go down the tubes.’ Thestories are endless and merciless, but remember those quotes from earlier aboutGreenspan and bankers:[../Images/00031.jpg]Figure 595: Those that control the banking system are Archon bloodlines and sohave no empathy and no mercy.> ... I can recall the Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals, but never> having the supremacy to lead them. I still regard them as lackeys and not real> brokers of occult power.

They love it – death andmisery is their energetic nectar and the more the better. The people’s debt andausterity bailed out the bankers but they still went on paying themselvesgrotesque bonuses while those who saved them via governments fell ever deeper inthe mire (Fig 596). The new year of 2013 opened with 210,941 US homes foreclosedin the January – one in every 624 American homes. Meanwhile, the chairman of theRoyal Bank of Scotland, which was bailed out by the taxpayer and is 82 percentowned by the government, said that his chief executive’s pay was ‘modest’. Yes,a ‘modest’ £8 million a year in salary and bonuses. These people live on adifferent planet. It’s a form of mental illness. Small businesses could suddenlynot secure credit from the banks they had bailed out even if they had perfectcredit histories because the chance was and is being taken to destroy allcompetition so the Archontic corporations can run everything (Fig 597). A reportin 2013 revealed that the percentage of Americans working for themselves is atits lowest in the entire history of the United States. People squeezed betweenbanks denying credit and government’s cutting welfare payments have been forcedinto the lairs of vicious and callous loan sharks charging phenomenal interestand threatening violence for nonpayment. A record nearly 50 million were onstate food stamps in the United States by the start of 2013 because ofunemployment and poverty – an increase of 70 percent since the crash of 2008.This figure amounts to 15 percent of the American population and that is doublewhat it was in 1975. The Bullingdon Club rich-kids in Britain, Prime MinisterDavid Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne, are attacking and demonisingthe poorest and most vulnerable, the jobless, homeless and disabled, into evermore extreme levels of depravation and fear while they and the Archontic bankersthey serve are allowed to do what they like. British journalist Sonia Paulton,one of the tragically few worthy of the name, wrote an excellent demolition ofthe Cameron/Osborne welfare cuts that have brought great depravation andsuffering to sick and disabled people in the UK:[../Images/00074.jpg]Figure 596: ‘So you say you need a loan?’[../Images/00259.jpg]Figure 597: The world the Archon networks are working to create and it isclearly happening across the world.> So these cuts will now become law and, as a nation weeps, the details are> sorrowful when applied to reality.

Party labels are irrelevantand we are looking at a single seamless force behind all of them. More than300,000 people aged 70 or over are still doing often menial jobs because theycan’t afford to live off a paltry state pension that they have spent their wholeworking lives paying into and the best part of two million children live in coldhomes in Britain because ever-increasing energy prices charged by corporationsmaking ever-increasing profits. The daily headlines around the world say it all:Greece Turning to Desperate Measures as Citizens Face Starvation Due to EconomicCollapse; Greece’s Unemployment Rate to Hit 29% in 2013; French Woman KillsHerself and Children over Financial Woes; Depression, Suicides Rise as Euro DebtCrisis Intensifies; More Abandoned Children as Europe Austerity Wears On;Disability Deaths ‘On the Rise’ in UK; 100,000 more children to be plunged intopoverty; Quarter of British People Skip Meals to Heat Their Homes; One in fourAmericans is suffering from malnutrition; 17 Million Americans Repeatedly RunShort of Food: Report; Homeless Children in Shelters on the Rise in NYC But Manyare Turned Away; America’s descent into poverty; Ireland: The Devastating SocialImpact of Economic Austerity Measures; Spain Plunders 90% Of Social SecurityFund To Buy Its Own Debt. What a stark contrast it all is with this headline:‘Fed Members Gave Their Own Banks $4 Trillion During Bailout.’ James S Henry, asenior advisor and Global Board member of the Tax Justice Network, said:‘Private elites ... had accumulated $7.3 to $9.3 trillion of unrecorded offshorewealth in 2010, conservatively estimated, even while many of their publicsectors were borrowing themselves into bankruptcy, enduring agonizing“structural adjustment” and low growth, and holding fire sales of publicassets.’ Lloyd Blankfein, the Rothschild Zionist CEO of Goldman Sachs, who haddone so much to bring the world economy to its knees, told CBS that people wouldhave work longer and harder and take a delay on their pension entitlements.Blankfein really does give evil a bad name (Fig 598). The truth is, as Bloombergreported in February 2013, that the profits of the banks that pay theirfantastic bonuses are almost entirely due to the tidal wave of taxpayer moneyhanded over by their cronies in government and the Federal Reserve. Bloombergsaid:[../Images/00283.jpg]Figure 598: Lloyd Blankfein swears to tell the truth? Never. It can only meanthat he wants to leave the room.> Lately, economists have tried to pin down exactly how much the subsidy lowers> big banks’ borrowing costs.

They’re just taking thepiss. These people are truly evil when you think of the consequences for thepopulation on which these Archontic parasites feed. While people suffer suchhardship and deprivation, the leading bankers are paid billions and thehotel-heiress and professional tosspot Paris Hilton is reported to be spending$350,000 of her $100 million fortune (for doing nothing) on a two-story housefor her dogs. This is the lifestyle of an American hedge (financial speculation)fund manager described at alternet.org:> Steven Cohen [Rothschild Zionist] of SAC Capital is a typical product of the> New Gilded Age. He paid $14.8 million for his Greenwich home, which he stuffed> with a personal art collection that boasts Van Gogh’s Peasant Woman Against a> Background of Wheat (priced at $100 million); Gauguin’s Bathers ($50 million);> a Jackson Pollock drip painting (also $50 million); and Andy Warhol’s Superman> ($75 million).> Not satisfied, Cohen spent millions renovating and expanding, adding a massage> room, exercise and media rooms, a full-size indoor basketball court, an> enclosed swimming pool, a hairdressing salon, and a 6,734-square-foot> ice-skating rink.

Youwill see how this fits so perfectly into the plan for human servitude on a scalenever seen in known human history when I come to the Hunger Games chapters. The‘Third World’ or ‘Developing World’ (inversion) was the first to be targeted andenslaved in sweat shop factories, slave labour and living conditions of filthand squalor. This was essential to doing the same in the ‘free’ world because itgave the Archontic corporations a way to make their products for cents on thedollar in China and the Far East where the Archons in power are some of the mostextreme on the planet, and this, in turn, allowed for the transfer of jobs fromthe West to the East (Fig 599). If employment had stayed high and adequatelyrewarded in North America and Europe the economic coup could not have happenedand so the fatal haemorrhage of jobs and incomes was instigated through thecentralisation of power programme known as globalisation (Fig 600). Archonticpoliticians and bureaucrats in governments, the European Union and the UnitedNations working through Rothschild-Rockefeller fronts like the World TradeOrganization sold a belief in ‘free trade’ (inversion) which means freedom forthe Archon corporations to exploit everyone on earth. The removal of tradebarriers (barriers to exploitation) has happened in concert with thederegulation of financial checks and balances and the pigs were set loose tosnout the global trough. I would like to sincerely and unreservedly apologise topigs here for symbolically associating them with these people. The Archoncorporations can now make their products in a country using slave labour kept inline by the police state of an Archon government and then sell them in the richworld at an enormous profit. China is the blueprint for how they want the worldto be with an incredibly rich El-lite served by poverty-stricken massessuppressed by a violent and ruthless force of military police which can keep thepopulation under surveillance 24/7. If people can’t see this being introduced inthe West day by day then they are not paying attention. The engineered crash of2008 and the biggest transfer of wealth or buying power from people to El-litein recorded history was a giant step to this end. A sign of what they plan tocome is the use of prisoners to make products for slave wages. The US prisonservice competes with commercial companies for government contracts. Thegovernment-owned Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR) employs 13 thousandprisoners to do this work and the more prisoners they have the more productsthey can make. There are more inmates in American prisons than any other countryin the industrialised world. This prison slave-labour government company UNICORpays no taxes and has none of the costs that a commercial company faces whichare imposed by the same government that owns UNICOR. Michael Mansh, aPennsylvania clothing manufacturer, almost had to close a factory and lay-off100 employees when UNICOR completed unfairly for a major contract. It was onlywhen Mansh went on national television to tell his story that UNCOR withdrew.The Archontic networks are global and so there is no surprise that the same ishappening elsewhere. Inmates from Prescoed prison in Monmouthshire, South Wales,were revealed to be working for a call centre for 40 pence an hour or £3 a day.Becoming Green, the company involved, admitted firing other employees after theprisoners were taken on for ‘work experience’. Kenneth Clarke, a former ministerin the despicable governments (on so many levels) of Margaret Thatcher,announced in 2012 a doubling of the number of prisoners in British jails workingfor 40 hours a week on welding, plastering, motor mechanics, printing andcontracts for the private sector. Clarke, who became the justice secretary(inversion) in the Cameron government, called prisoners a ‘wasted resource’.This is what humans are to these people: ‘a resource’. Some prison staff havecalled the scheme ‘disgusting’ and a ‘worrying trend’, but they better get usedto it because if we allow this to continue the Tiptoe ends with the slave labourcamps. We are also seeing the return of debtor prisons with people simply toopoor to pay what they ‘owe’ (non-existent credit) being jailed as a punishment.As one headline put it: Return of the debtors’ prison: ‘How debt collectors in aTHIRD of states are throwing poor citizens behind bars for owing just $280’.Well, at least they will find plenty of work there, eh? The American CivilLiberties Union (ACLU) produced a report entitled In For a Penny: The Rise ofAmerica’s New Debtor Prisons in which it revealed how ‘day after day, indigentdefendants are imprisoned for failing to pay legal debts they can never hope tomanage ... In many cases, poor men and women end up jailed or threatened withjail though they have no lawyer representing them’. The ACLU said that courts inOhio are illegally jailing people because they are too poor to pay their debtsand often deny a hearing to determine if they can pay what they owe. A New YorkTimes report described how ‘the mushrooming of fines and fees levied bymoney-starved towns across the country and the for-profit businesses thatadminister the system’, was leading to ‘growing numbers of poor people ...ending up jailed and in debt for minor infractions’. There are rich laws andpoor laws with those well off enough to pay the fines going home and those whocannot going to jail. The slave labour agenda can also be seen in the policy ofthe British Government to stop the welfare benefits of thousands of youngunemployed (mostly thanks to governments and banks) unless they do three monthsof unpaid work. No one personifies the grotesqueness of what is happening morethan Australian mining tycoon Gina Rinehart who is said to be the world’srichest woman. She called on Australians to take a pay cut because Africans canbe hired for $2 a day. She also said that Australians should ‘spend less timedrinking or smoking and socialising, and more time working’. Yes, to makeRinehart even richer.[../Images/00124.jpg]Figure 599: Jobs have been ‘outsourced’ to sweat shops in poor countries tobring the US economy to its knees and make the population dependent on thegovernment and its agencies.[../Images/00330.jpg]Figure 600: Globalisation is simply the expansion of global control by the fewover the many.Another part of the strategy for Archon corporations and governments is toconstantly increase prices of essentials like food, fuel and energy and increasetaxation and costs and fines of all kinds to squeeze the masses into the hellishArchontic nightmare that life has now become for billions – but is stillcomparative paradise compared with where they want to go. Forcing all Americansto take out health insurance with Obamacare or face big fines from the IRS atthis time when people are in desperate straits is all connected and still moreconfirmation, if any be needed, of the soulless android that occupies the WhiteHouse. The make-it-up-as-you-like judicial system also ruled in 2013 that thegovernment can deny social security payments which people have paid into alltheir lives if they refuse to enrol in the state Medicare system or withdrawfrom it when Medicare is supposed to be voluntary. Well, we’ve just decided it’snot, too bad. Lawyer Kent Masterson Brown, who represented clients challengingthe ruling, said: ‘Not only have the courts allowed these agencies to grantthemselves permission to seize a retiree’s Social Security benefits should theyopt out of Medicare, but they have allowed those agencies to turn voluntaryprograms into compulsory ones’. This is the new America, mate. The scale oftaxation is incredible and when you add all the other taxes to income tax and anexplosion of stealth taxation hidden behind ever increasing fines and fees thepercentage of income that goes to the state would blow your mind if it was allput together. An article on Gazette.net captured the theme:> Consider all the ways we’re taxed. When we’re born (birth certificate), when> we die (death certificate), when we make money (income tax), when we spend> money (sales tax), when we own property (property tax), when we sell property> (capital gains tax), when we go to a concert or ball game (amusement tax),> when we own a vehicle (license, registration, tolls, gas tax) and special> taxes on cell phones, tobacco, alcohol, energy, etc. Then, when we die, they> tax our income all over again (death tax). Heck, they even tax our bowel> movements (flush tax).Yes, the death or inheritance tax is the government taxing again what hasalready been taxed before it can be passed to loved ones. The Gazette.netarticle was about Maryland introducing a rain tax after the EnvironmentalProtection (inversion) Agency ordered Maryland to reduce storm water runoff intoChesapeake Bay at a cost of $14.8 billion. This is being raised by taxing peopleon the amount of ground covered by anything like a patio, driveway or roof thatstops rainwater soaking into the ground. They are assessing this by usingsatellite imagery and geographic information systems. No one thought that GoogleEarth was created as a service to the people did they? These are all examples ofthe Archon state parasitizing the life-force and creative imagination of thehuman population for the Archon crazies. The middle class is being sucked intothis economic plughole so they and those labelled working class become a singleserf class serving the tiny El-lite protected from the serfs by segregation,distance and the Orwellian tyranny that is emerging by the hour (Fig 601). Sothe poor are being made poorer and those who were not poor are fast becoming so.But there are still large numbers of people who are neither poor nor super-richor part of the bloodline cabal and they are now being targeted in the next stageof mass human subjugation. This is the reason for what happened in Cyprus inMarch 2013 when private bank accounts were seized and plundered. Up to thispoint money had been transferred from people to banks via governments throughcollective taxation and additional debt and this led to austerity policiesagainst the poor; but that didn’t address the ‘problem’ of those who were stillfinancially okay. To get them the conspirators need to go direct to theirindividual assets and in Cyprus this precedent was set after the Cypriot bankingsystem faltered apparently through its financial connections to the collapsedeconomy of Greece. The ‘rescue’ deal was agreed at the behest of the so-called‘Troika’ of the Rothschild-controlled European Central Bank,Rothschild-controlled IMF and Rothschild-controlled European Commission withRothschild-owned Germany in the mix, too. This was the ‘deal’ (state theft):[../Images/00165.jpg]Figure 601: All by calculated design.> • The country’s second largest bank, Laiki Bank, was split into two parts, a> ‘bad bank’ and ‘good bank’, before being closed, incurring thousands of job> losses.> • Deposits in Laiki Bank of less than 100,000 euros (effectively the ‘good> bank’) are insured by EU law and were transferred to the country’s biggest> bank, Bank of Cyprus.> • Deposits in Laiki Bank of more than 100,000 euros are not insured by EU law> and they were put into the ‘bad bank’.> • Deposits in this ‘bad bank’ and deposits of more than 100,000 euros in Bank> of Cyprus were frozen and used to pay Laiki’s debts and recapitalize Bank of> Cyprus. These uninsured depositors will have to face enforced losses of up to> 60 percent, even 80 percent on their deposits.People with those accounts had no choice. The ‘Troika’ simply stole their money.The propaganda promoted the fact that many rich Russians owned accounts thatwere hit (another reason for what was done), but there were far more who hadlegitimately worked their whole lives to accrue that money who suddenly lost upto 80 percent of their assets above 100,000 euros. One day people were livingout their lives comfortably on the money they had spent their whole livesearning and the next most of it was gone – stolen by the state and the bankingsystem. Yes, I can hear people say, but that’s not as bad as what is happeningto those with nothing. No, it isn’t, but the point is that it is all connected.They are two facets of the same war on human freedom and have to be seen in thatcontext or divide and rule will continue until the cliff edge appears foreverybody. The ‘deal’ also included Cyprus selling some state-owned firms so theArchons can have them. What happened in Cyprus, with banks hit by the GoldmanSachs-engineered Greek financial collapse, was all planned long before the storyhit the media. Very large amounts of money were suddenly withdrawn from Cyprusbanks at the start of 2013 and much of this would have been due to those in theknow warning their friends and associates about what was coming. The Italianmedia reported that 4.5 billion euros left Cyprus in the week before the crisiswas made public. The respected Cypriot newspaper Filelftheros revealed thatCypriot president Nikos Anastasiades had warned close friends about what wascoming so they could move their money abroad. He said nothing to the Cypriotpeople that he was elected to represent (in theory) only the month before. TheCypriot newspaper Haravgi also reported that a company owned by the relatives ofAnastasiades moved millions of euros out of the country a few days before the EUstole depositors’ money. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch minister of finance andpresident of the Euro Group of euro-country finance ministers, said that theCyprus ‘rescue programme’ represented a ‘new template’ for resolving euro zonebank problems and ‘other countries may have to restructure their bankingsectors’. This caused outrage and great anxiety and he had to startbacktracking, but what he had done was let slip what the plan really is to stealthe people’s money. There is currently an EU Eurozone guarantee on deposits of100,000 euros or less (hence that amount was excluded in Cyprus), but all ittakes is for the crisis to continue to escalate (as planned) and then it will be‘we cannot afford the guarantee any longer’. Then they can clean out everyoneand create their mega-rich, mega-poor Orwellian global state that I have beenwarning about this past nearly 25 years. It also became clear in the wake of theCyprus theft that US Homeland Security is claiming in internal memos that underthe (9/11-justified) Patriot Act it has the right without any warrant to seizeany customer bank accounts and to open and inspect the contents of safe depositboxes and to remove ‘bar gold, gold coins, firearms of any kind unlessmanufactured prior to 1878, documents such as passports or foreign bank accountrecords, pornography or any material that, in the opinion of the agent, shall bedeemed of to be of a contraband nature’. The Canadian Government of RothschildZionist-controlled-to-his-fingertips Stephen Harper proposed plans forCyprus-style ‘bail-ins’ should major Canadian banks fail. They are coming foryour money so that you can be forced into servitude. The Cyprus precedent alsoseverely damaged confidence in the banking system and made bank failures evenmore likely and this is all part of the script. Greece is no longer a member ofthe EU – it’s a colony and this is what the Archon bloodlines are seeking foreverywhere as they batter the masses into submission. Greece agreed that itslenders in one bailout could seize the country’s gold reserves of 111 tonnes andthe plan is to do the same eventually with the far more gold-wealthy Portugal(382.5 tonnes), France (2,435.4 tonnes) and Italy (2,451.8 tonnes). If Greecedefaults its assets will be seized and it will not be able to tradeinternationally. Greece is being crushed to pulp and it is the blueprint forevery country. They want the people so desperate that they will either agree towhatever they are told to do or will be too weak to resist. The Fabian Societyin London is a major strand in the web and I mentioned earlier that it is namedafter a Roman general whose modus operandi was never to engage in a decisivebattle in which one side could win or lose. His approach instead was to weakenthe enemy over a period of time until they were so weak that he and his armycould walk in unchallenged. This is what the bloodlines are doing to the humanrace and we are now reaching an advanced stage.The final crash of the current system is almost certainly planned to beaccomplished through what they call the ‘derivatives market’. A simple, but lessthan full explanation of derivatives is that it involves fraudsters hedgingtheir financial bets by scamming someone else into taking their risk and sellingthe same financial ‘products’ to multiple buyers who all think they are the onlyowner. It is another fresh-air, no substance, mega-disaster being primed tohappen. Derivatives normally operated through the ‘swap market’ but have beenmoving in on the future’s market. Both are outrageous casinos but the future’smarket has fewer regulations. One figure I saw for the ‘worth’ of thederivatives market was $639 trillion – but with no official figures it’s allguesswork anyway. Derivatives expert Paul Wilmott estimates that totalderivatives exposure in the world’s financial markets could add up to $1.2quadrillion – that’s $1,200,000,000,000,000 or an estimated 20 times the valueof the world economy. To say the numbers don’t add up is like saying Attila theHun had some anger issues. The derivatives market is actually worth basicallynothing – it is all fresh-air transactions that exist only on paper and in themind. When this obvious fact is revealed – smash, bang, wallop, good night andgod bless. US regulators have given the major banks the go ahead to usedepositors’ money – that’s you and me – to fund their exposure to thebound-to-fail derivatives market and it is all a plan to make the vast majorityof the global population destitute. People better start making plans as bestthey can because this is already past the point of no return (in every sense).One organisation to seriously have on the radar is the CME Group (ChicagoMercantile Exchange) which operates major derivatives and futures exchanges inChicago and New York. The chairman emeritus of the CME Group, a ‘pioneer offinancial futures’ and chairman of its Strategic Steering Committee, is LeoMelamed (Rothschild Zionist). Watch that space.Archon laws – one for them and one for usThe corrupt and depraved banking system crashed the global economy with the mostextreme consequences for billions and yet no major player was even arrested letalone convicted for their organised crimes against humanity. The likes ofGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan go about their criminal enterprises in the knowledgethat they own the departments of government, agencies and courts that should becalling them to book. The ‘little people’ are jailed for years for minor drug orfinancial offences while HSBC was exposed for laundering billions of dollars ofmoney for the Mexican drug cartel with no leading official even facing charges.The US Department of Justice (inversion) waved it all away with a $1.9 billionfine that would have taken the bank little time to recoup with profits of nearly£16 billion in the same year and the HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver waspaid a bonus of $2 million. The London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor scandalwas also met with pocket-change fines after it was revealed that banks had beencolluding in falsifying the Libor average banking interest rate of major Londonbanks. This had the effect of making the banks look more creditworthy than theywere while producing big profits and distorting the entire global financialsystem which uses the Libor as a reference rate for other transactions includingmortgages, loans of all kinds, and investments by pension funds and state andlocal governments. Those that lost out have had to take the civil route forrecompense after there was no prosecution but in March 2013 New York Judge NaomiReice Buchwald dismissed much of a class action lawsuit in favour of banks suchas the Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. The same judge also dismissed a claimby a consortium of American organic farmers and seed dealers concerned aboutMonsanto’s genetically modified seeds and said the suit was a ‘transparenteffort to create a controversy where none exists’. I wonder when we get to thissubject later if you will think that GMO could possibly be described as a‘controversy where none exists’. US Secretary of Treasury Timothy Geithner(Rothschild Zionist) admitted under questioning by lawmakers that he knew thatbanks were manipulating the Libor rate but did not report this to the Departmentof Justice. Consequences for him? Nil. Glenn Greenwald captured the hypocrisy inan article for the Guardian:> The US is the world’s largest prison state, imprisoning more of its citizens> than any nation on earth, both in absolute numbers and proportionally. It> imprisons people for longer periods of time, more mercilessly, and for more> trivial transgressions than any nation in the west.

You couldnot make it up and the conflicts of interest are so in your face today. Obamaappointed Mary Jo White to head the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)which is supposed to police the activities of the banks and yet she had spentthe previous ten years defending the banks from the SEC and other regulators asa partner in the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. Before that she was the firstwoman to be US government attorney for the Southern District of New York whereshe was responsible for Wall Street. It was Mary Jo White who intervened to stopSEC inquiries into John Mack, former chairman and CEO at Morgan Stanley, overpossible insider trading. When the SEC investigator complained that his inquirywas being blocked he was fired on the spot without notice and the investigationdropped. This is the woman now holding Wall Street to account?? It’s a joke, butthis is how the Archontic banks and corporations get away with their organisedcrime. They make sure their people are running the government agenciesofficially assigned to regulate and prosecute them. The revolving door that seesArchontic place-people moving between the regulators and regulated is spinninglike a top. Dave Hartnett, the head of Revenue and Customs, Britain’s taxcollection agency, stepped down after being accused of lying, but was then hiredby HSBC, a bank with which he dealt at Revenue and Customs, to advise them on‘honesty’. We’ll be hearing next that Stalin advised Hitler on peace and love.The stories are legion of US regulators overseeing the (non) investigation ofbanks and financial firms and then later being hired by them. It is the samestory with the oil corporations. BP and Shell were raided by Europeanauthorities in May 2013 on suspicion of rigging fuel prices, but Prime MinisterCameron said that no executives could be prosecuted under the present law. What?The level and scale of corruption is staggering and this is why the mega bankingand corporate criminals avoid imprisonment while people like 83-year-old JacquesWajsfelner of Weston, Massachusetts, who had fled Nazi Germany to go to ‘free’America, was jailed for five years for not filing an annual Report of ForeignBank and Financial Accounts. He wasn’t even jailed for avoiding taxes, just notfiling the account. This one law for the rich and powerful and another foreveryone else is now becoming blatant and the idea is to reach the stage whenthere is no law for the rich and powerful and only for everyone else. Paying taxis once again what the ‘little people’ do. Minor tax discrepancies and genuinemistakes by the public are met with fines out of all proportion to the errorwhile major corporations and banks often pay no tax at all. I highlighted thisin relation to banks and corporations in Remember Who You Are and we have sincehad the revelations about Starbucks, Google, Apple and Amazon paying little orno corporation tax in Britain on their UK profits and American banks goingoffshore to avoid paying tax at all. This makes them parasites (that word again)on the British and American people and economies which generate those profits.Bank of America set up more than 200 subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands and notonly paid no tax but was given a $1.9 billion tax rebate by the Internal RevenueService – the same IRS that mercilessly targets the general population. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs did the same saving $4.9 billion and $3.3 billionin US taxation, and Citigroup has paid no federal income taxes in the four yearssince receiving a total of $2.5 trillion in bailout funds from the FederalReserve after 2008. Major corporations paid an average of only 12.1 percent ofearnings in taxes in 2011 and 25 of them paid their CEOs more than they paid incorporate income taxes. Lin Homer, Permanent Secretary of UK Revenue andCustoms, said the British Government could not stop international corporationsdeclaring their profits in other countries with tiny rates of tax even when theprofits are accrued in Britain. It emerged that Google alone had avoided £10billion in UK taxes in a single year by moving nearly 80 percent of pre-taxprofits to a shell company in Bermuda. Microsoft (chairman and founder BillGates) avoids £159 million in British corporation tax every year by funnellingprofits through Luxemburg and Ireland to Bermuda. Amazon’s UK division paid just£2.3 million a year corporation tax on £7.1 billion in sales while it costGoogle only £6 million in corporation tax on £2.5 billion in sales in the UK. Itwas revealed in 2012 that Starbucks had paid only £8.6 million in corporationtax since it launched in Britain in 1998 despite sales revenue of £3 billion.Starbucks volunteered to pay £10 million a year in the face of public outrage.Ever tried volunteering what you pay in tax? Detailed research by theorganisation Corporate Watch revealed that six water companies operating inBritain avoid paying millions in tax by routing profits once again through taxhavens and by using a legal loophole that the UK Government chose not to close.This was revealed as water bills continued to increase for the strugglingpopulation and the same with the energy corporations like Britain’s EDFrevealing massive profit increases while announcing massive price increases forcustomers. One thing to watch for very carefully is this ‘problem’ of globalcorporations not paying tax being used to offer the ‘solution’ of a globaltaxation system which will require a global government and financial structureto implement it. This is highly likely given that politicians condemning Googlefor tax avoidance are on the VIP list for Google events. Meanwhile, smallbusiness trying to compete with the next-to-no-tax corporate giants are screwedfor every last penny and the corrupt UK tax authorities are even ‘naming andshaming’ small firms such as hairdressers and plumbers for allegedly owing taxwhile doing nothing to challenge the arrogance of the corporations. But what anencapsulation of the game – kick the little people and let the mega rich dowhatever they want. British tax collectors have people snooping on socialnetworking sites, in newspapers and via a £45 million computer system calledConnect, designed by defence contractor BAE Systems, which works in combinationwith other data bases like the Land Registry. There is also a hotline for thepublic to report each other (74,000 calls in 2012) with informants being paid upto £20,000, according to the UK Daily Mail. Ironically, most of thoseadministering this war on the masses are themselves of the masses and when theyleave the protection of the system they are going to face the same consequencesthemselves for all they have helped to impose on others. Do they really thinkthe system cares about them when corporations are taking out secret lifeinsurance on their employees and picking up all the pay-outs when they die?Incredible? No, just par for the course. This is a report atWallstreetonparade.com:> Most Americans are unaware that for at least 25 years big business and banks> have been secretly taking out millions of life insurance policies on their> workers and naming the corporation the beneficiary of the death benefit> without the knowledge of the employee.

The public is being bled-dry with highertax, costs and fines. Tickets for dropping litter in Britain rose from 727 in1997 to 63,883 in 2012 after Xfor, a private company run by former soldiers, wasemployed by councils with the incentive of keeping more than half of every £80fine it imposes. Xfor made £1.6 million in commissions in 2012 by targeted thepublic for the most minor offences, including dropping bank cards, pens and evencotton from a glove. One of their methods apparently is to hide in the bushes.So they should in bloody shame – not that they have any. Private companies havebeen hired to do the same with parking fines. The school around the corner fromme is on a very wide road and parking is no problem to the flow of traffic, butevery morning and afternoon when parents drop off and pick up their children aparking attendant is there to try to ticket mums and dads. Many of thesefamilies are going hungry because they can’t afford to buy enough food. Onceagain this software in uniform has no shame or compassion. New fines for newmotoring ‘offences’ continue to mount and fines for ‘illegal’ (we say so)parking have increased by fours time in England in a decade to more than £300million a year. In 2010/11 council revenue in England from on-street parking –streets the taxpayer pays to build and upkeep – was £346 million. This was morethan ten times what it was 20 years ago and revenue from all parking has reached£1.3 billion in England alone for councils paying their executives more than theprime minister. It was even revealed in 2012 that UK Revenue and Customs hadmade £30 million the previous year by charging premium phone rates for peoplecalling to ask questions about their tax affairs with some £100,000 paid bythose waiting to be a dealt with. These are all examples and the list is endlessof the masses being squeezed to destruction and submission, and the cold-heartedidiots in uniforms and dark suits like those described here will find eventuallythat the system wants to destroy them, too. The foundation of the entire systemis the passing of laws by Archontic politicians for the benefit of Archonticorganisations and at the expense of the target population. This ‘law’ isoverseen and administered by a ‘legal’ system and judiciary that isoverwhelmingly – though not yet totally – as corrupt as the corruption that itis there to serve ‘safe’ judges that are appointed to cases that the system mustwin and to head ‘inquiries’ in which the outcome is decided before it evenbegins. We are then told that an ‘eminent judge’ had decided this or that whenhe or she is just another eminent professional liar and systemserver. Judges andlawyers come through the same ‘education’ programming machine as thepoliticians, scientists, academics, bankers and corporates. The legal andjudicial system is also alive with secret societies that oil the wheels ofcorruption in the courts of the world. Prosecuting attorneys in the UnitedStates have been exposed for colluding in the most extraordinary ways with thedebt collection agencies they should be overseeing. The Huffington Post reportedin 2012:> From Baltimore to Los Angeles, prosecuting attorneys are renting out their> letterhead – and their law enforcement clout and credibility – to debt> collection companies, as a recent exposé in the New York Times revealed.

Where does that money go? It’s split between the debt> collection company and (wait for it) the prosecutor’s office.But what are Archons? They are parasites and deceivers. Control of the ‘law’ isessential to the whole conspiracy because it allows them to make their criminalactivity ‘legal’ simply by passing a law in their centres of government and toavoid prosecution if they do break a law they have not yet deleted. It furtherallows them to target innocent people deemed a problem to them with a falseprosecution and often a long jail sentence or in some countries a deathsentence. The legal system has been made so incredibly expensive that it isimpossible for the vast majority to seek justice against governments,corporations and the super-rich who can pay for whole teams of legalpeople-crushers. ‘Justice’, like everything else, is on sale to the highestbidder. I had to go through the courts in the United States and Britain to stoptwo people using me as their personal cash cow while contributing nothing. Theyboth lost comprehensively and ended up with not a penny after they wereabsolutely demolished under cross examination by a British barrister and anAmerican lawyer who showed me that the legal profession is not yet totallycorrupt and that decent people genuinely seeking justice do still exist. I cansay the same about the two judges involved, too. But the combined cost ofsuccessfully defending two outrageous cases that should never have come evenclose to court was enormous and without public support with the first one Iwould have gone under along with everything I do. The law in general, though notevery case, is systematically rigged and that’s why the corporate crooks go freeand the jails are full of people who have done a fraction of what the Archonshave done and still do every day.Where has the gold gone?Another scandal that is yet to break in its true magnitude can be summed up withone question: Where has all the gold gone? Certainly there are increasingnumbers of ‘gold’ bars being found that are relatively worthless tungsten with acovering of gold to make them look authentic (Fig 602). Tungsten is the samedensity as gold to three decimal places. But putting the pieces together overthe years it is clear to me that much of the gold that officially exists doesnot, or at least is not where it is claimed to be. US Congressman Ron Paulunsuccessfully called for a ‘purity audit’ of the ‘gold’ in Fort Knox to proveits authenticity and CNBC requested a tour of Fort Knox to film the gold andupdate the last footage that was taken in 1974, but the request was refused. Anofficial said that Fort Knox is a ‘closed facility’ and he was not aware of anymember of Congress touring the facility since 1974. The House of Rothschild hasdominated the world gold market and the price of gold was set every day at theoffices of N M Rothschild in London from 1919 until 2004 when the Rothschildssuddenly withdrew. The German court of auditors ruled that the Bundesbankproduce an audit of Germany’s gold reserves of nearly 3,400 tons, the secondbiggest holding in the world. The gold is held bizarrely – on the face of it –with the Bank of England, Bank of France and the US Federal Reserve. Venezuela,like Germany, has demanded the physical return of its gold. Other countries likeSwitzerland have shown similar concern and so they should because we are goingto find that the gap between the gold that officially exists and that whichreally exists is absolutely colossal. Anyone paying attention over the last fewyears will no doubt believe that nothing would ever surprise them any more aboutthe behaviour of banks and governments, but let me try you with this one:National central banks have been ‘leasing’ their gold reserves to a group ofmajor banks known as bullion banks. These then ‘sell’ the gold to their clientsat a rate that means people are holding paper ownership of far more gold thanactually exists. In short, the banks have been selling the same gold over andover and we are back to the goldsmiths and the way that worthless paper moneycame into being. How on earth, you will rightly ask, can governments lease theirgold to bullion banks who then sell the same gold to multiple parties and thegovernments still claim to own the gold as reserves? But then we are talkingabout the Planet Earth financial system which is as insane as those that createdit – and report it, too. This is CNBC’s senior editor John Carney commenting onthe question of whether all the gold does or doesn’t exist. It is an exhibitionof major league craziness and delusion:[../Images/00235.jpg]Figure 602: The fake ‘gold’.> In reality, it does not matter one bit whether the Federal Reserve Bank of New> York actually has the German central bank’s gold or whether the gold is pure.> As long as the Fed says it is there, it is as good as there for all practical> purposes to which it might be put. It can be sold, leased out, used as> collateral, employed to extinguish liabilities and counted as bank capital> just the same whether it exists or not.> The actual presence of the gold wouldn’t make a lick of difference unless,> say, Germany’s central bank decided it wanted to start using the gold for some> practical, non-monetary purpose like making watches.> For almost all imaginable operational purposes, the actual existence of the> gold in Fort Knox or in the vault beneath the FRBNY’s Liberty Street> headquarters is irrelevant. The bookkeeping is what really matters here. So> long as the Fed says Bundesbank owns X tons of gold, the Bundesbank can act as> if it did own the gold – even if the gold had somehow been swallowed into a> gold-eating galactic worm hole.> I’m sure the Bundesbank officials understand this quite well, even though the> German Audit Court does not. There is nothing to be gained by inspecting the> gold. If it is all there and pure, there is no difference from an undiscovered> absence. But if the gold isn’t there, well, calamity could follow as trust in> the central bank gold depositories evaporated instantly.This is the fairyland that the system’s advocates believe in. When the truthabout gold holdings comes to light they will hear the crash on Mars, but thenthat is the idea.Getting ‘real’I was invited a long time ago to do a weekend event at a sort of stately homeplace by a New Age fellah who told the audience that they must ‘get real’ eventhought he had yet to start himself. By ‘real’, in this context, I am speakingof facing reality and understanding reality so that we can change reality. Bythat criteria, ‘getting real’ is an absolute essential – the crucial startingpoint. We are at best peering over the precipice, ladies and gentlemen, and webetter bloody face the fact before we are hurtling towards the ground. Indeed,we already are if you look around. So many people in the Western world now go tobed hungry just as those in other regions have done since their lands werehijacked by Western corporations and governments. There is a food bank in thetown where I live trying to ease the hunger of children and their families asbest they can and some five million UK families were relying on loans andsavings to buy food by early 2013 according to a report by the consumer magazineWhich? Yet while this is happening you see headlines like these: ‘Goldmanbankers get rich betting on food prices as millions starve’ and ‘Barclays makes£500m betting on food crisis’. Rothschild Zionist Goldman Sachs made more than aquarter of a billion pounds in 2012 by speculating on food prices and Barclays,a major player in the Libor scandal, made half a billion doing the same. MorganStanley is the other market leader in food speculation while people starve, butthen why not when an executive of the food trading giant Glencore said that theglobal food price crisis was a good business opportunity? These people reallyaren’t – literally aren’t – human and so if you apply values like love,compassion, fairness and kindness to them you are losing the plot. Let no onewith a mind of their own tell me that ‘they wouldn’t do that’ when they aredoing that every minute of every day. Yet the program is still so strong in theminds of billions and nothing freezes people in denial of reality more thanwishing that the reality wasn’t happening. I don’t want this to be true and so Iwill convince myself that it isn’t. I watched the half-time programming-fest atthe 2012 Super Bowl with shaking head and saddened heart. The Super Bowl withits fantastic American and global TV audience is no longer just a sportingevent; it is a programming ritual for the collective mind of America and furtherafield. There was a performance by Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z who, as withpeople like Madonna and Lady Gaga, surround themselves with Saturnistic andother Archontic symbolism. We had children from Sandy Hook school singingAmerica the Beautiful for no other reason than to be mercilessly exploited topromote the disarming of Americans for deeply sinister reasons. I’ll addressthis later. Then Alicia ‘Obama groupie’ Keys sang the national anthem andre-sold the illusion that America is the Land of the Free at the very time thatit is being financially destroyed and consumed by an Orwellian tyranny. Keys satat her piano on the satanic pentagram ‘stars’ of the American flag with picturesof US troops cheered for imposing tyranny and slaughter of the innocent infaraway lands and amid the patriotic tears and patted hearts of football heroes.The tears were not in response to reality, but to manipulated illusion. Outsidethe reality bubble mayhem was taking place.Before their teary eyes the United States they think they are adoring is on lifesupport because the plan has always been to use America to destroy America as Ihave for so long warned. The United States played its part in the expansion ofArchontic control as it was allowed to become a ‘superpower’ and impose its willfinancially and militarily on the world; but American was never an end, only ameans to an end. The Archons want to impose their will through a totalitarianworld government and that cannot happen if there are any superpowers with thefinancial and military might to resist its dictatorship. The United Statestherefore had to be brought to heel and this is happening by the minute. Americais already bankrupt. Government debt has officially passed $16 trillion but thatis nothing like the extent of it. Debt galore has been hidden from the officialrecord and some estimates have put the total as high as ... wait for it ... $220trillion. This was the view of Laurence Kotikoff, economics professor at BostonUniversity, in an interview on the Russian TV station, RT. He said that when alldebt is taken into account the United States is in worse shape than Greece andIreland. Money pouring into the hands of banks and other Archontic institutions,not least for overseas wars of Archon acquisition, have continually expanded theofficial debt to the legally-imposed debt-ceiling; but all that happens is thatthe politicians and bankers then go through a pantomime for public consumptionwith catch-phrases like ‘fiscal cliff’ and dire warnings of what will happen ifthe ceiling isn’t raised when they know they were always going to raise it (Fig603). A little time later the new limit is reached and it is pantomime seasonagain. This is being allowed to happen because the Archon bloodlines want todestroy America financially and militarily. This is why Ben Bernanke (RothschildZionist), the Federal Reserve chairman who should be in jail with the keymid-Atlantic, said the debt-ceiling has no value to the United States and shouldbe scrapped. No, Bernanke and his still-today puppeteer Greenspan should bescrapped. Between 2002 through 2011 outsourcing overseas deleted 3.5 million‘middle class’ jobs in manufacturing and in the same nine years only 48,000 newjobs were created for architects and engineers. This is the state of Americatoday as seen through its infrastructure: About a third of all roads are insubstandard condition; nearly a third of road deaths are linked to ‘substandardroad conditions, obsolete road designs, or roadside hazards’; one in every fourbridges carries more traffic than originally intended or is in need of repair;repairing all substandard bridges would cost an estimated $140 billion; 4,095dams are at risk of failure and that is an increase of 100 percent since 1999; athird of dam failures since 1874 have happened in the last ten years; sewersystems spill more than a trillion gallons of untreated sewage every singleyear; America spends about 2.4 percent of GDP on infrastructure while Chinaspends about 9 percent and projections suggest that it would cost $2.2 trillionto repair existing infrastructure without building any more. States and federalassets (in theory belonging to the population) are being sold off tocorporations at a fraction of their worth and great chunks of America are beingbought up by other countries, most notably China. I have said since the 1990sthat China is fundamental to the Archontic conspiracy both economically andmilitarily and this is why the Rothschilds and Rockefellers have such a presencethere. Archontic (Rothschild-Rockefeller) forces in the American Government haveawarded China incredibly generous ‘free trade’ agreements that have allowedAmerican jobs to be transferred to sweat-shop China and American businesses tobe destroyed by the tidal wave of Chinese imports sold by Archontic superstorechains such as Walmart (Fig 604). This has created a US trade deficit with Chinaover the last decade of more than 2.3 trillion dollars. All of this heads toChina while the American economy collapses and while America loses half amillion jobs a year to China according to the Economic Policy Institute. One waythat the Archons within the US Government sought to bridge that gap was toborrow vast sums of money from ... China. This is once again largely fresh-airmoney that America cannot repay and now China is coming back for its collateral.The Chinese Government and corporations (same thing) are buying up great swathesof America in the form of businesses, homes, farmland, property, infrastructureand resources and now want to set up ‘special economic zones’ which would beowned by China on American soil and employ Chinese workers shipped in from backhome. China is doing precisely this in Africa and destroying local businessesand trades. China is offering to write off more than a trillion dollars in USdebt in return for this ‘equity’ (buying up America) as part of a long-time planfor the colonisation of North America and further afield.[../Images/00263.jpg]Figure 603: By debt to destruction and it has all been planned from the start.[../Images/00120.jpg]Figure 604: Archon Mart.[../Images/00389.jpg]Figure 605: You want something?This is what has been happening while people have been playing on their Xboxes,watching TV, ‘supporting the troops’, cheering Beyoncé at the Super Bowl, buyingthe daily government and media lies and singing the national anthem incelebration of the Land of the Free. But this is not only happening in theUnited States. The European economy, the biggest in the world, is imploding, orrather being imploded, and the world is being pied-piped to economic Armageddon(Fig 605).Did I mention that it’s time to wake up?"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00195.jpg]Archon MediaIron rusts from disuse, stagnant water loses its purity, and in cold weatherbecomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigours of the mind.Leonardo da VinciWhen you have so much to hide you require some serious propaganda andsuppression of information to keep your game under wraps and the Archons havejust that. It is called the mainstream media. This epitomises the foundation onwhich everything else stands or falls – the manipulation and control of humanperception (Fig 606).Archontic corporations have seized so much of the global media in the last morethan 50 years that even most local newspapers and radio stations are owned bycorporate giants. This has happened in North America as it has in Britain andthroughout the world. Reports suggest at the time of writing that the AmericanRothschild Zionist billionaires David and Charles Koch are considering a bid fora string of major newspapers including the Los Angeles Times with ‘competition’from Rothschild Zionist Rupert Murdoch. The plan to own the entire media whilecensoring the alternative media continues apace. I worked in news on a localradio station in Birmingham in the 1970s which was then owned as a singleentity, but corporations have long taken over and everything is now centralisedwith multiple stations controlled from a single point even down to the choice ofmusic or the ‘playlist’. This has been done to destroy diversity which is theArchontic equivalent of garlic to a vampire. When you are seeking to control themasses through the manipulation of their perception of reality the control ofwhat they see and hear is absolutely crucial. It is the bottom line andeverything else depends upon it. Diversity of information sources meansdiversity of potential perception as people decide which version of something isthe most credible to them. If they are getting only one constantly recurringversion of an event, be it a war, terrorist attack or financial collapse thenthe chances are that at least most people will believe this mono-narrative inthe absence of an alternative explanation. Watch corporate-controlled ‘news’ orgovernment-controlled sources like the BBC and you will see basically the sameangle taken with the same stories and events. The BBC doesn’t question thegovernment version of anything that really matters and rarely do any of theothers. They take the US government’s account of 9/11 to be the truth when itcame from the very same people that gave us non-existent ‘weapons of massdestruction’ in Iraq which was proved to be a whopping lie to justify theinvasion of an entire people and the mass murder of so many. Real journalismwould have been demanding resignations and prosecutions, but the lambs andlapdogs on the corporate payroll just carry on as if nothing has happened andthe political mass killers are allowed to go on unquestioned and unchecked todeliver their next lie and the next and the next. This is not only confined tothe Western media either. Mr Mendacious himself, Al Gore, the front man for theglobal warming scam, made $100 million from the sale of his little-watchedCurrent TV to the Qatar-based ‘Arab’ station Al-Jazeera which was funded intoexistence by Qatar dictator Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Al-Thani. The Emiris better known in my house as Sheikh bin Doing Whatever US kin Says after beingthe conduit for the funding and arming of US-NATO ‘rebels’ in Libya and Syriaand with his Al-Jazeera plaything supporting the official story while claimingto represent the interests of the Arabic people. The Gore acquisition allowsAl-Jazeera to greatly increase its presence in America and expand its Archonticpropaganda while hiding behind its manufactured and thoroughly underserved imageof Muslim bias. It tells Arab viewers what they want to hear so the Emir and hisUS masters can manipulate their perception of what is really happening in NorthAfrica and the Middle East. First you get their attention and trust and then youcan twist the truth and still be believed. We have thus had Western countriesand Arab countries fed the same Archontic line about Libya, Syria and theacquisition of North Africa and the Middle and Near East.[../Images/00093.jpg]Figure 606: ... and now here’s Bill with the weather.Mendacious repetitionThe BBC doesn’t question the Big Lie about human-caused global warming becausegovernment policy says that the lie is true; it doesn’t question 9/11 or theofficial justification for mass murder and conquest in Libya or the support forprofessional thugs and killers called ‘Syrian rebels’ or the demonisation ofIran to prepare people to accept yet another war. It just takes the officialline and repeats it as ‘news’ and ‘journalism’. This is what journalists are –repeaters of the official and mainstream version of everything just likescientists, doctors, academics and politicians. The BBC is virtually the Londonbranch of Mossad when it comes to reporting events in Israel and Palestine andit has been from the start a subsidiary of British Intelligence if you go deepin the shadows where the BBC interlocks with the secret society and satanicnetworks as all major media operations do. The BBC and corporate news in generalworldwide report any Israeli bombardment of defenceless Palestinians withstate-of-the-art American-supplied weaponry as only retaliation for attacks byPalestinians on Israel. Given the difference in hardware, this is like sayingthat to spray machine gun bullets in all directions is only retaliation toattacks by a bloke with a peashooter. A detailed investigation by Greg Philo andMike Berry of the Glasgow Media Group in their book More Bad News from Israeldocuments the systematic BBC bias in favour of Israel which is imposing amilitary occupation of Palestine in flagrant and arrogant disregard forinternational law. Had Iran done a fraction in total of what Israel does in aweek there would be international calls to send the bombers in to ‘protect thecivilian population’ and the BBC and the other media prostitutes would be givingthem cover. But this is Israel ... shhhhhhhhhh! The media line that ‘Israel hasa right to defend itself’ is, as one writer put it, like justifying lethal forcefor vandalism. Yes, some Israelis have been killed by direct hits and that isterrible. The taking of all human life is to be condemned, but multiplethousands are killed in Gaza by Israel’s high-tech killing machine and the greatmajority are civilians, including children, who have fired nothing at anyone.The BBC’s so-called ‘flagship’ (at half-mast) radio news programme Today did notreport the deaths of five Palestinian teenagers by the Israeli Army in November2012 because the editor Dominic Groves said: ‘Even in the space of a three hourprogramme it is not always possible to cover every development in a story –especially one as long-running and complex as the one in the Middle East.’Complex? Five kids were killed by the Israeli army. What on earth is complexabout that? But when a 16- year-old Israeli was killed by a Palestinian rocketthe same Today programme gave it prominent coverage. This built-in bias is thenorm not the exception in the mainstream media across the whole swathe of dailyevents. The Israeli war criminals could never have got away with theirabominations for so long without the BBC and the corporate media telling onlyits side of the story (lies, lies and more lies) while labelling Palestinians onthe other end of this military onslaught – this systematic genocide – as theterrorists. But then the Rothschild networks own Israel, America, Britain,Canada and NATO and they own the corporate media and the BBC. The public istherefore given the version of the Israel-Palestinian conflict that suits whatthe Rothschilds and company want people to believe. The BBC is a fundamentallycontrolled organisation with a long-line of editorial censorship and strictrules on stories being ‘signed off’ before being allowed to air. This includesan ‘editorial policy’ that goes under the Orwellian name of ‘EdPol’. All BBCstaff and independent production companies working for the BBC are forced toundergo mandatory ‘EdPol’ training. The new Director-General of the BBC TonyHall announced in February 2013 that his head of corporation policy, strategy,digital services, public affairs, communications, marketing and audienceresearch – pretty much everything – would be the notorious Rothschild Zionistsuper-apologist, James Purnell. His career has included lots of time in therevolving door between Labour Party Zionist politics and the BBC. He was astudent researcher to Tony Blair, BBC Head of Corporate Planning, Labour PartyMP and government minister, and now the BBC’s head of everything that matters.Most significantly from a bias perspective he is a former chairman of the LabourFriends of Israel and spent a week in Israel at their expense in 2002 beforereturning to launch a pro-Israel propaganda campaign which included thismemorable example of Saturn-symbol arse-licking in 2004:> ... As the (non-Jewish) chairman of Labour Friends of Israel for the last two> years, I have been shocked by the occasional demonization of Israel that I’ve> encountered. Israel’s government makes mistakes. So do the leaders of the> Palestinians.

I would> call it passive, or unexamined, anti-Semitism.Yes, the BBC is in very good hands – if your name is Netanyahu.It is a global cliché that ‘you don’t believe what you read in the newspapers’,but most of those who say that then go on to do so and most people have no ideahow deep the bias and mendacity goes. The mainstream media is the corporatemedia and so the Archon media with all the major newspapers, magazines,television and radio stations owned by the Archontic corporations to program thepopulation to see self and the world ‘the right way’ (Fig 607). The majorInternet information, search engine and social media sites are owned by the samepeople along with the Internet itself which was only made possible by militarytechnology. I worked in the mainstream media for years in newspapers, radio andtelevision which gave me an insight into how it operates. There are, as always,a tiny few who own and use the media in full knowledge as a vehicle for massprogramming to a specific end; but the rest are the programmed programmers whodo what they do for money, to serve their own vindictiveness and personalagenda, or because they are so programmed and ill-informed that they think theyare reporting events as they really are. The corporate media is comprisedoverwhelmingly of the latter and it is the global home of what I term thearrogance of ignorance. Most ‘journalists’ have no idea about the world theythink they are reporting and yet, because they are ‘journalists’ who have had ‘agood education’, they think they must know what is going on and that those, likeme, who tell a very different story must by definition be crazy. After all, ifeven the themes of what I say are correct then the news media are fundamentallymisguided and have been misleading the public all their careers. They don’t wantto face that and so it’s so much easier (in the short term) to keep their mindsclosed and abuse the messenger for the message they don’t want to hear. I havebeen taking extremes of abuse and ridicule from complete idiots in the media forthe last quarter of a century. I take this as a compliment because if they saidthat I was credible I would have to rethink everything. Journalists mostly thinkthey know it all for the same reason that scientists, academics, politicians anddoctors do. They have been through the same ‘education’ programming machine andbought the bollocks. So when they are reporting anything the bollocks is theirstarting point and as bollocks begets bollocks that original flaw in perceptionbecomes endless articles and television news reports that are expressions andmultiples of the original bollocks. Journalistic programming continues with thevery nature of their lifestyle. Most only seek access to other mainstreamsources like government statements, mainstream science and medical opinion,other newspapers, wire services and media outlets which are as programmed asthey are while the newsroom television spews out the mainstream and officialversion of everything 24/7 on the rolling news stations. When I occasionallywatch them the only things rolling are my eyes. The most programmed people Ihave met in my life have been politicians, scientists, doctors, academics andjournalists and yet they are taken to be the most informed. This inversion(again) is no mystery, however. They are programmed by the same system and sopeas from the same pod. They are computer terminals on the same Internet who aredownloading the illusion that they know what they are talking about so they cantransmit those same delusions to the target population (Fig 608). The Archonconspiracy would not be anywhere close to where it is today in terms of theOrwellian nightmare without the actions and inactions of the controlledkeyboards of the mainstream media across the range of print, radio, Internet andtelevision. David Rockefeller, one of the pillars of the conspiracy for the bestpart of 70 years, is reported to have told ‘media facilitators’ at theBilderberg Group meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany, in 1991:[../Images/00322.jpg]Figure 607: Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks, bollocks, bollocks, bollocks, crap.[../Images/00337.jpg]Figure 608: You are feeling sleeeepeeeee.> We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time and other> great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected> their promises of discretion for almost 40 years ...

The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world> bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in> past centuries.This statement was reported by two French newspapers and Hilaire du Berrier, thevehemently anti-communist publisher of the Monte Carlo-based Hilaire du BerrierReports and a long-time researcher of the Bilderbergers.[../Images/00412.jpg]Figure 609: Amber Lyon is rare proper journalist in a sea of ignorance,compliance and acquiescence.Suppressing realityThere are some journalists, but only some, who do buck the system as best theycan. Sonia Paulton, a freelance proper journalist in Britain comes to mind whoworks with television stations and national newspapers like the Sunday Express.Even then people like her can only go so far in telling the real truth beforethey meet the boundaries of the censors, who are sometimes censoring in aconscious exercise in suppression but mostly censoring for fear of theconsequences of not censoring in libel actions or fury from on high. Soniabecame a presenter on the censorship-free The People’s Voice, the global TV andradio station that I launched in 2013 (see back of book). Another notableexception is former CNN reporter Amber Lyon who put her profession to shame in2012 when she revealed by her actions that she is a real journalist in amainstream media crawling with frauds, fakes, liars, cheats and sycophants (Fig609). Lyon was an award-winning investigative reporter with the Criminal NewsNetwork and was trying to tell the truth about the tyranny and mass murder inBahrain when she realised the true extent of the corruption at CNN – as with allthe mainstream corporate news operations. Lyon was sent to Bahrain in 2011 tocover the protests against the (self-proclaimed) ‘royal’ tyranny of King Hamadbin Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa and the despicable dynasty that has ruled thecountry for more than 200 years (kept in power by Britain and, more latterly,America). CNN did not want her to report the truth about the Bahraini regime,but as a rare proper journalist in the mainstream arena this is what she did.Lyon compiled interviews and evidence exposing the killing, imprisonment andharassment of peaceful demonstrators and how others were just disappearing. Shedid this despite extreme intimidation directed at her and her film crew by theBahraini regime which included forcing them to the ground with guns at theirheads. There were also vehement complaints to CNN executives by the Khalifadictators. Bahrain is home to the US Fifth Fleet and many American multinationalcorporations. It has a highly significant banking sector while petroleumproduction and processing account for 60 percent of its export receipts and 70percent of government revenues. For this reason the American and Britishgovernments support Bahrain no matter what and so while the Khalifa regimekills, maims and tortures its own people nothing is said or done by the glovepuppet ‘leaders’ of the ‘free world’. But while atrocities in Bahrain areignored, target countries like Libya and Syria are condemned and invaded for‘killing their own people’ when in truth the ‘rebels’ involved have been largelynon-Libyan and non-Syrian mercenaries trained mostly by Britain and America andarmed through countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. This is thepolitical background to Amber Lyon’s efforts to tell the truth about what ishappening in Bahrain and she was to find that her own employers, CNN, the ‘news’station launched by big-time insider, Ted Turner, was seriously involved in themanipulation of public perception with regard to events in North Africa and theNear and Middle East. Her Bahrain report was aired just once by CNN in theUnited States, but not at all by CNN International (CNNi) which continued torefuse to broadcast even in the face of complaints from CNN staff. Lyon was alsotold to add statements to her reports that she knew were lies. ‘I couldn’tbelieve CNN was making me put what I knew to be government lies into myreporting’, she said. Then Lyon realised that CNNi was being paid by the Bahrainregime to air propaganda ‘documentaries’ about the fascist state under theheading of ‘sponsored programming’ and the same was being done with countriessuch as China, Georgia and Kazakhstan. So here we have a ‘news’ organisation(owned by the Archontic corporate giant Time Warner) making statesponsoredprogrammes to promote the image which the sponsoring states demand for theirbuck. At the same time, CNN is preventing its own journalists from telling thetruth about those countries by blocking their air time and insisting ontampering with their scripts. Lyon was also quoted as saying that the mainstreamUS media intentionally promotes propaganda against Iran to manipulate publicopinion to support a military invasion. She said that the demonisation scenarioused before the war on Iraq was being repeated with regard to Iran and Syria.Lyon was never sent back to Bahrain after her suppressed report and she was maderedundant by CNN in March 2012. She was threatened with losing severancepayments and health insurance if she spoke out against the broadcaster andexposed its deceit and journalistic corruption, but she has done so anyway toher great credit. Two other proper journalists and investigative reporters JaneAkre and Steve Wilson were fired by Fox News after refusing to accept misleadingalterations to their story about the dangers of Monsanto’sgenetically-engineered bovine growth hormone and similar stories can be found inabundance all over the world. This is the intimidation that keeps journalistsquiet and frightens them into factual submission. I have heard people say sooften over the last nearly 25 years that if what I was saying was true the mediawould be reporting it. When you have worked inside the mainstream media and seenit in all its ‘glory’ from the other ‘side’, as I have, that statement threatensdeath by laughter. The biggest suppressor of truth by journalists is notcensorship, but the sheer programmed ignorance about what is really happening inthe world and how everything is connected. Then comes censorship and this takesthe form of executive censorship and, by far the worst, self-censorship.Mainstream journalists are not hired for their intelligence and knowledge of theworld as it really is. They are hired as compliant repeaters of the official andcorporate line. Report events within the strict parameters of ‘acceptable’perception and you’ll do fine. You may even be seen to have ‘made it’ by gettingyour own show on CNN like one-time professional Israeli lobbyist Wolf Blitzer,CIA intern Anderson Cooper or the pseudo-’journalist’, the deeply bewildered,arrogant and uninformed Piers Morgan. Expose conspiracies to destroy America,like CNN anchor Lou Dobbs, or, as with Amber Lyon, expose the outrages in acountry like Bahrain which sponsors programming on your network, and one way oranother the door comes into view. I remember watching some of Dobbs’ showsduring speaking trips to the United States and wondering how long CNN wouldcontinue to employ him when he began to call out the planned North AmericanUnion and other aspects of the Archontic agenda. Not for much longer was theanswer and Dobbs announced in 2009 that he was resigning after a near 30-yearcareer at the network.While the immorality of the media covers up death, destruction and suppressionwe have the fake morality of never calling a fuck a fuck, but a f**k. This is areport at the Huffington Post and you see this all the time in newspapersworldwide: ‘Sir Bradley Wiggins has belatedly unleashed anger at his former idolLance Armstrong, labelling the cycling cheat a “lying b*****d”.’ Now, what doyou think he said? Lying so and so? Lying possum? Lying low? Lying in? Well,being an adult with a modicum or even smear of intelligence and going so far ascounting the * thingies between the b and d, it is my assessment aftercontemplating for, oh, the best part of 0.5 seconds, that Wiggins has calledArmstrong a ‘lying BASTARD’. So what’s with the b*****d? I’ll tell you. It isthe fake, fraudulent, hypocritical and self-deceiving morality that putsasterisks in words like b*****d and f**k while happily supporting wars thatleave human beings, often children, with limbs and flesh scattered all over thestreet. That’s fine. It’s ‘fighting terrorism’. That’s a moral and just war,isn’t it? But quoting someone saying bastard or fuck has to be symbolicallycovered over, for symbolic is all it is, to preserve the illusion of fakenose-in-the-air morality. Newsrooms in which fuck, bastard and more are thecommon language must protect the mystique of morality by throwing in a few******s. You see, it’s okay in this self-deceiving ‘moral code’ to think bastardand fuck because what else goes through anyone’s mind when they see b*****d andf**k except bastard and fuck? But so long as you don’t read bastard and fuck infull the moral high-ground is retained. They are, after all, ‘responsible andprincipled’ publications. It is hilarious and pathetic and the moral version, inits own way, of saying that you are pepper-bombing cities of civilians toprotect the lives of the same civilians. I run with a different ‘moral’ code: Ifind war, killing and violence grotesque and immoral and the programmedsensibilities of language rather less of a priority. Call a b*****d a bastardand a f**k a fuck, I say. There, did anybody die, lose a limb or see theirchildren blown to pieces? Then there was the headline ‘BBC Radio 4 Rapped AfterListeners Mishear “Cox Sackers”’ Isn’t it fucking marvellous? Can I say fucking?I can’t? Well, fuck that. While people are being mass-murdered in manipulatedwars and are going hungry because of engineered economic collapse there arethose so upset by the words ‘cox sackers’ that they make an official complaintand a BBC ‘Standards Committee’ takes them seriously. Make a complaint about theBBC’s blatant bias, however, and they reach for the delete button. Is there afirst grade school for adults? No? Well, there bloody should be. The real ‘coxsackers’ in this case are those who complained because they were ‘upset’.Ahhhhh, bless their little cotton socks. Play on words? Outrageous. Dead bodiesof children with brown faces? Collateral damage. The news report said: ‘The BBCTrust’s Editorial Standards Committee, which upheld the complaint, concluded:“The phrase was not articulated clearly enough and could easily have beenmisheard for the offensive word “c*** suckers” by the majority of the audience.’I think they mean cock suckers, what do you think? Was this the name of thecommittee? Or the complainants? Or both? Looking at the evidence, I am guessingboth. Please rearrange into a well-known phrase or saying ... up, me, Scotty,beam.Illusion of choiceThe corporate media is structured in basically two ways. Mostly you have thepompous and delusional ‘quality journalism’ operations like CNN and the BBCwhich point their noses skywards and ridiculously claim to be impartiallyreporting events. Then, especially in the United States, you have apparentpolarity ‘news’ stations like Fox News (‘The Right’) and MSNBC (‘The Left’)whose role is to perpetuate the illusory ‘choice’ of two-party politics. Foxsupports the Republicans and MSNBC supports the Democrats, but the key point, ofcourse, is that both support and promote the system within which ‘Republicans’and ‘Democrats’, as with ‘Labour’ and ‘Conservative’ in the UK, are differentnames for each other. Fox News is owned by Archontic asset Rupert Murdoch andMSNBC is owned by Archontic assets NBCUniversal Media (General Electric, or GE,and Comcast). The late great American comedian Bill Hicks was right on when hesaid:> I’ll show you politics in America. Here it is, right here. ‘I think the puppet> on the right shares my beliefs’ ... ‘I think the puppet on the left is more to> my liking’ ... ‘Hey, wait a minute, there’s one guy holding out both puppets.’So to perpetuate this illusion of choice the American public is given peoplelike Bill O’Reilly on Fox News (‘The Right’ and The System) and Rachel Maddow onMSNBC (‘The Left’ and The System) to give nightly support to their designated‘side’ and to attack each other (Figs 610 and 611). MSNBC also have a presenter,I certainly can’t use the term ‘journalist’, called Chris Matthews, who actuallyonce said that listening to Obama gives him a ‘thrill going up his leg’. Howfunny, the sensation runs down mine. To ‘The Right’ it is good for Bush to go towar and kill lots of people with brown faces on the other side of the world, butnothing like as good when Obama does it. To ‘The Left’ it is bad for Bush to goto war and kill lots of people with brown faces on the other side of the world,but nothing like as bad when Obama does it. The common denominator: lots ofpeople with brown faces on the other side of the world being killed. Maddow andO’Reilly launch into each other’s stations and political parties to give theimpression of political debate and diversity with Maddow’s intellectualheart-on-the-sleeve, woman-of-the-people approach contrasting with O’Reilly’snightly portrayal of a right-wing bigot and warmonger who would triple thetoilet roll order at the very thought of going to a battlefield himself. It’sall a game, all a smokescreen, and people like Maddow and O’Reilly are deludedenough about the world they are ‘reporting’ to be completely oblivious to theway they are being used. The money is good, though, with O’Reilly earning anestimated $20 million a year for talking absolute crap. Ahhh, but it’s thecabal’s crap and so he is richly rewarded. MSNBC and Fox will argue overirrelevant detail, rhetoric and smokescreens, but when it comes to the pillarsof the Archontic agenda they all speak as one: Are political parties different?Yes, of course, what do you think we are arguing about every night? Is there aconspiracy that connects political parties, banks, corporations and corporatemedia? What? Of course not – you’re a crazy conspiracy theorist. Is theofficial, nonsensical and contradictory official story of 9/11 true? Yes, ofcourse – you’re not a conspiracy nut are you? And so on and so on. Even a lot ofthe anti-Bush or anti-Obama coverage is only ‘anti’ on the surface. An MSNBCtalk show hosted by Iraq war opponent Phil Donahue was conveniently droppedaround the time of the invasion in 2003 and later an internal NBC memo came tolight which said that Donahue had to go because he would be a ‘difficult publicface for NBC in a time of war’. These media frauds may appear to disagree on thesurface, but they are as one when the fundamentals of the global agenda are atstake – in this case eliminating more people with brown faces. This was whatFox’s ‘fair and balanced’ Bill O’Reilly said in February 2003:[../Images/00296.jpg]Figure 610: Bill O’Reilly (‘The Right’ and The System).[../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 611: ... Rachel Maddow (‘The Left’ and The System).> Once the war against Saddam Hussein begins, we expect every American to> support our military, and if you can’t do that, just shut up. Americans, and> indeed our foreign allies, who actively work against our military once the war> is underway, will be considered enemies of the state by me.> Just fair warning to you, Barbara Streisand and others who see the world as> you do. I don’t want to demonize anyone, but anyone who hurts this country in> a time like this, well – let’s just say you will be spotlighted.Meanwhile, MSNBC has hired Obama’s former White House chief of staff andcampaign advisor Robert Gibbs as a ‘contributor’ and also David Axelrod as asenior political analyst when he ceased to be Obama’s senior White House advisorand election campaign chief after winning Obama a second and final election in2012. The news came as presenter Chris Matthews was having another thrill up hisleg discussing if Obama should have his face added to other presidents on MountRushmore, a ‘debate’ started by MSNBC’s Al Sharpton, another Jesse Jackson whoannounced that he would never criticise Obama under any circumstances aboutanything. Sharpton presents a nightly political talk show on MSNBC. God help us.Analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalismrevealed that in the last week of the 2012 campaign there was not one negativestory aired about Obama and not a single positive one about his opponent MittRomney and they call it journalism. MSNBC was created by US media giant NBC inleague with the Microsoft Corporation of big-time Archontic front man, BillGates. Fox News is owned by Archontic front man, Rupert Murdoch. So why wouldanyone think that they would not be singing the same song using only slightlydifferent lyrics? It is the same with political ‘comedians’ in the United Statessuch as Zionists Jon Stewart (Jonathan Leibowitz) and Bill Maher (Figs 612 and613). Maher, Stewart and others like them on big corporate salaries are alsothere to perpetuate the illusion of free expression and accountability for thepolitical classes. Stewart is all jokey, blokey, and ‘look at those idiots’, butwhen he interviews leading political figures and mass killers like Barack‘Where’s My Drone’ Obama and Tony ‘Who Can I Bomb Next?’ Blair he’s like a babein arms, cooing and clucking and bringing up wind. Not coincidentally, Stewartand Maher are both vehement opponents of anyone questioning the official liesabout 9/11 and Stewart in another fawning interview with Homeland SecuritySecretary Janet Napolitano made his distaste and contempt very clear for thoseexposing the conspiracy. Neither Stewart nor Maher would last a week if theiropinions were otherwise and they used their public platform to demand answersfor all the lies and contradictions that they choose not to see. Rachael Maddowproduced a documentary called Hubris in February 2013 to mark the tenthanniversary of the Iraq War and it focussed on the (Republican) lies that wereused to sell the invasion. The themes of her programme were in my book TalesFrom The Time Loop published just seven months after the troops went in nevermind ten years later. It doesn’t matter a decade after the fact because theArchon networks have got what they wanted and it’s all done and dusted. Wherewas the exposure at the time – because the evidence was there? Maddow’s film wasan exposé of the Republican administration of Bush and Cheney, but where is anyexposure of Obama who picked up the same baton and continued the same agenda?Oh, sorry, criticising Obama is the job of Fox News because he’s a ‘Democrat’.Maddow is another vehement denier of a wider conspiracy for human enslavementand she condemns and ridicules those who suggest otherwise. But, then, onceagain, if that were not so she wouldn’t be employed by MSNBC.[../Images/00247.jpg]Figure 612: Jon Stewart (sarcasm and The System).[../Images/00158.jpg]Figure 613: Bill Maher (politically incorrect [inversion] and The System).Fix NewsMurdoch’s Fox News – Fix News – was exposed by its own former staff in a DVDentitled Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch’s War on Journalism (www.outfoxed.org[http://www.outfoxed.org]). Frank O’Donnell, a former Fox News reporter, saidMurdoch dictated the content of a network that claims with bare-faced cheek ofthe most bare-faced cheek to be ‘fair and balanced’ (Fig 614). O’Donnellrecalls:[../Images/00348.jpg]Figure 614: This is like saying Hitler was a peacemaker.> We received an order from one of Murdoch’s apparatchiks ... that we should cut> away from our newscast and start carrying a fawning tribute to Ronald Reagan> that was airing at the Republican Party Convention. We were stunned because up> until that point we were allowed to do legitimate news and suddenly we were> ordered from the top to carry propaganda, to carry Republican right wing> propaganda.O’Donnell said they were ordered to run a long uncut report attacking DemocratTed Kennedy, a long-time opponent of Murdoch, which had no news value. TheOutfoxed documentary could have equally applied to a long list of global ‘news’operations, not least the Fox policy of imposing a ‘message of the day’ issuedby executives every morning to dictate to their ‘journalists’ what stories wouldbe covered and promoted, which would be ignored, and how the chosen subjectswould be presented as ‘news’. Former Fox contributor and CIA intelligenceanalyst, Larry Johnson, told how the daily diktat would include ‘a detailed listof subjects to talk about and not talk about’ and ‘edicts to the reporters tocontrol what they could say and how they could say it’. Presenter Jon Du Presaid that a memo would arrive from Fox headquarters every day saying ‘we want totouch on the following issues, we want to cover the following stories, we wantto do them in this particular way’. Du Pre was suspended for not beingenthusiastic enough in his all-day reporting on the birthday of Ronald Reagan.He reported to the Fox audience that Reagan admirers had ‘been streaming in fromall over the country and even parts of Canada and Mexico ...’ This simply wasn’ttrue but he said it to watch his back and protect his job in the face ofpressure from Fox News executives furious at the tone of his reporting whichreflected the truth of what was happening and not their desired ‘line’. Fox Newscontributor Larry Johnson describes how correspondents and those booking guestsfor interviews were ‘being monitored by a Stalinist system, afraid to be seentalking to the wrong person or having the wrong kind of e-mail exchange’. FormerFox producer Frank O’Donnell said it was made very clear that staff were beingmonitored and what wasn’t watched and assessed by executives in real time wouldbe reviewed later from the recording. ‘Expert’ interviewees are chosen accordingto the political perception that Fox News wishes to promote and not for theintelligence of the contribution. How could that not be the case when one of theregular Fox News contributors is William Kristol, a founder of the NeoconProject for the New American Century and editor of The Weekly Standard, thepropaganda sheet once owned by Rupert Murdoch and which, together with Kristoland his neocon buddies, played a major role in pressing for the invasions ofAfghanistan and Iraq. Former Fox News producer Clara Frenk said the Republican(‘Conservative’) contributors were well known and ‘very, very strong people’,while the Democrat (‘Liberal’) guests included only one person she had everheard of. Frenk said that Fox often used ‘faux-liberals’ (who essentially agreedwith the right-wing line) or they ‘would just bring on people who were veryweak, you know, people who were not well-known’. Even if you are asked to appearyou had better keep to the party line. Contributor Larry Johnson says that hewas dropped after he answered basically ‘no’ to the question posed by Fox Newsmouth-for-sale Sean Hannity in the run up to the invasion of Iraq about whetherthe Bush administration could fight two wars at the same time:> And Sean Hannity, being the right-wing cheerleader that he is, was just, you> know, incensed that I ... had the temerity to suggest that we couldn’t. Facts> don’t seem to have any effect upon him. What was unusual is it was after that> appearance that, even though I was under contract to Fox for another eight> weeks roughly, they stopped using me.This is what is called ‘fair and balanced’ news when it is really blatantpropaganda. Boy Bush counter-terrorism advisor Richard Clarke got the Fix Newstreatment when his book, Against All Enemies, criticised the administration’sactions before 9/11 and the decision to invade Iraq. The book also contradictedthe official stories of people like Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and ActingChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers about what they were doingon the morning of September 11th. Jeff Cohen, a former Fox News contributor,said:> When Richard Clarke emerged it was obvious this was a danger to the> Administration because he had worked at the highest echelons of the Bush> Administration and it was almost like Fox News was working off the playbook> coming out of the White House – that he had to be torn down, that he had to be> turned into a Democrat, a Liberal ...The same modus operandi of targeting and seeking to discredit people telling thetruth is happening all over the world every day. Fox News was the first USnetwork to announce that Boy Bush had been elected president on the night of hisrigged election ‘victory’ against Al Gore in 2000. The announcement was made byJohn Ellis, who ran the Fox News ‘election analysis’ division and was a firstcousin of George W Bush. Ellis made his move when the data from Florida clearlymade the vote too close to call, but this Bush relative went ahead and announceda Bush victory. This prompted the parrots at ABC, NBC and CBS to do the same.John Nichols, a Washington correspondent for The Nation and author of the Cheneybook, Dick: The Man Who Is President, said:> When Fox made the call that Bush had won and the other networks followed on,> that created the perception that Bush was the winner, when in fact he wasn’t.> But that perception was what really held for the next 37 days and I would> suggest to you that call on election night had more to do with making George> Bush president than any recount or ballot design issue.Once Bush was handed the presidency and officially sanctioned the long-plannedinvasion of Iraq, Fox News was onside as usual manipulating its audience tosupport the slaughter of more people about whom the viewers’ knew nothing exceptfor what Fox News had told them. Dave Korb, a former Fox News freelance writer,revealed how he was ordered to lie about what was happening in Iraq. He saidthat a senior producer told the two or three writers for her segment:> Now just keep in mind, it’s all good. This is such a fair and balanced issue.> Don’t write about the number of dead or troops being under fire or under> attack. Not that somebody might have died, you know, keep it positive. We’ve> got to emphasise all the good that we’re doing.Korb described how the producer made a reference to rebuilding schools andbringing democracy to Iraq. She said: ‘See big progress. Yoo hoo for us’ (Fig615). Censorship and manipulation of ‘news’ creates the environment of fear andintimidation which brings about self-censorship. Once ‘journalists’ andproducers are clear on what the limits and parameters are they simply stopreporting or offering stories that are outside that blueprint. Whether somethingshould be reported or not reported is no longer even discussed and argued onceself-censorship kicks in because nothing outside the parameters is even offeredfor publication or broadcast. This is where we are at and have been for a verylong time. The media ‘in’ word for a story being censored is ‘spiked’ – thestory has been ‘spiked’. This comes from a spike on the desk of editors, stillused when I was in the mainstream media, onto which rejected stories werethrust. Self-censorship means, in effect, spiking yourself before the story iseven suggested, let alone written. A former Fox News reporter, who remainedanonymous to protect his career, said:[../Images/00251.jpg]Figure 615: Not only Fox News, either.> When you have this Executive Vice-president and those around him, who are> consistently saying, ‘no we’re not gonna do that story, no this story’s bad,> this story’s good’, and it becomes very clear to all the Bureau Chiefs, to> everybody involved who have been there over a period of years, there are> certain kinds of stories, it’s not even worth bringing up, there are other> kinds of stories that you know management’s gonna love.Structure of ControlControlling the media is nothing like as hard as it would at first appear. Thekey is corporate ownership or, in the case of the BBC and other statebroadcasters, direct government control (although ‘governments’ arecorporations). The news policy in terms of bias, suppression and propaganda forthe Archontic agenda then filters down from the top. Editors and news executivesare appointed by the owners on the basis of their compliance to their dictatesand they in turn appoint other compliant people as producers and ‘journalists’.Some genuine journalists do slip through, but they still have to get theirstories past the editorial filter before they can appear in the paper or onradio and television news programmes. Every day before papers are completed orbulletins broadcast there is the editorial ‘conference’ in which those in chargedecide what stories will be included and what ‘treatment’ will be given to them.The collective media decided that the ‘treatment’ for Colonel Gaddafi andPresident Assad was to be that of evil men killing their own people and therewas no way that any alternative view or information would be allowed to cloudthe issue (Fig 616). ‘Journalists’ just love their black and white scenariosbecause it makes their lives so much easier than if they have to give both sidesof the story and challenge official propaganda with evidence to the contrary.The phrase ‘you are either with us or with the terrorists’, delivered by BoyGeorge Bush and repeated by Hillary Clinton, has a journalistic equivalent – youare either with us or you won’t be in tomorrow’s paper or on tonight’s teno’clock news. Journalists are despatched to cover stories as a matter of coursewith the angle they must take decided before they have even left the office totalk to people involved or to see what is going on. I have been told byreporters interviewing me that they will get as many positive points in thearticle as they can but if they make me look too good it won’t get in the paper.Then there is outright censorship even at the local level. I did an event nearmy home on the Isle of Wight as a technical run-through for my Wembley Arenaevent in 2012 and on an island of just 23 miles by 13, and in the light of whatI was saying, this was a local news story by any journalistic criteria. But boththe local newspaper and the main radio station ignored it completely becauseboth are controlled by the network of Freemasons and others known as the ‘IslandMafia’. This Mafia hate me with a vengeance for exposing their activities and sonever mind little things like journalism and serving the community – give Ickeand his views no publicity. I worked for years in this environment as ajournalist in newspapers, radio and BBC television and I know how the systemoperates. I was involved almost entirely with presenting sport for the nationalBBC, but this included delivering sport bulletins on the national news atweekends which allowed me countless opportunities to observe the main BBCnewsroom at work. There were some good and genuine people there alongside thepompous, arrogant and incompetent, but they judged everything from theperspective of the system. It was the official version of everything reported asthe true account of everything. The BBC had a centralised ‘news’ gatheringsystem for national and world news which was known by staff as the ‘rip n’read’. ‘News’ bulletins were wired from London throughout the day to all BBCradio and television outlets in the UK including local radio stations and wereprinted out automatically in their newsrooms. Someone would then rip it off theteleprinter every hour or half-hour and walk into the studio to deliver thecontents to their audience as ‘truth’. The BBC communication system will bedifferent today in the electronic era, but the principle will remain the same. Ihave asked some of these people how they know that what they are reading istrue. There is either silence or a bemused look that says either ‘what a strangequestion’ or ‘I have no idea’.[../Images/00398.jpg]Figure 616: And now the news because we want you to be informed.Manning the barricadesThe BBC turns self-congratulation into a way of life in terms of its claims toimpartiality while pursuing its daily systematic bias and suppression ofalternative views. We have seen this so many times with its disgusting treatmentof anyone and anything that questions the official narrative and uses thedevil-word of the mainstream media – conspiracy. They won’t properly investigatethe world but then set out to ridicule, undermine and discredit those that do.One day it may dawn on these stupid people that they and their children andgrandchildren will have to live in the world that their arrogance, ignorance andbias is playing such a role in creating by suppressing its exposure. The BBCgatekeepers ran a series called Conspiracy Files in which they claimed toinvestigate the validity of conspiracy researchers regarding 9/11, the Londonbombings of 2005, and other events and situations. You knew before the openingtitles ran that the programme would conclude that the official stories were trueand the talk of conspiracies was nonsense. The BBC’s news and current affairscould not allow the official version of 9/11 to be questioned, let alonedemolished, because of everything that would come from that in its reporting ofworld events and wars in the context that those behind 9/11 are the very forcesusing those attacks to justify the ‘war against terrorism’. In this wayjournalists have a relationship with truth similar to the one between scientistsand quantum physics. They would rather close their minds to reality than facethe prospect of re-thinking and rearranging everything they do. This is bizarreto me, but true all the same. Conspiracy Files was even eclipsed in its scale ofbias by Conspiracy Road Trip in which the BBC took groups of people who believein various conspiracies to visit the scene of 9/11 or the London bombings in aneffort to discredit their views or get them to change their minds. The contemptthat the BBC has for the subject was confirmed immediately by the employment ofa clueless ‘comedian’ called Andrew Maxwell to lead the group in an effort topersuade them, or at least the audience, that there was no conspiracy (Fig 617).The BBC blurb for the 9/11 show proclaimed that the said clueless Maxwell‘fights an exhausting battle for the truth’ ... ‘in his mission to convert hisfellow travellers’. Put those two statements together and the scale ofcontradiction is shocking. Notice how the word ‘facts’ is only used here in theBBC promotional material in relation to the official version of events:[../Images/00375.jpg]Figure 617: Andrew Maxwell – knows all you need to know.> Andrew Maxwell thinks all five of them are wrong and wants to change their> minds by confronting them with the facts [given to him by the programme> producers].

How does losing your son on 9/11, tragic andheartbreaking as that is, make you in any way more aware, in and of itself,about what really happened that day? The implication is ‘how could you do thisto the families who lost loved ones by claiming it was a conspiracy?’ Familiesdon’t want to know the truth about why their loved ones died? Many families haveindeed sought this very truth and been blocked at every turn but there is nomention of them by the corrupt BBC or of the countless experts in their fieldswho have said that the official version of 9/11 simply could not have happeneddue to little details like the laws of physics (Fig 618). I was asked by a BBCradio interviewer once why I was showing disrespect to the families by sayingthat 9/11 was a conspiracy. How you put those thoughts in the same sentence onlyhe knows, but when I pointed out that many of the families were campaigning forthe same truth he had no idea that this was so. These people are so uninformedit borders on the criminal given their alleged profession. The promotional blurbquoted above encapsulates the BBC and the mainstream media in general in thatits starting point, and finishing point, is that the official story is true andanyone questioning this must be crazy and deluded. Comedian Maxwell was givenfree rein to dismiss any suggestion that the official story of 9/11 is not trueeven though the official version came from the same people who sold the worldthe non-existent ‘weapons of mass destruction’ in Iraq. The BBC is so pathetic,so disgusting, that words do not suffice. I don’t know why anyone agrees to takepart in these conspiracy programme set-ups. They have asked me and my reply tookonly two words, both with one syllable. But people still do, despite theexperience of a guy called Charlie Veitch. He’s the one with the shades inFigure 619. Veitch changed his mind on the 9/11 ‘road trip’ in the face of BBCpropaganda and agreed there was no conspiracy. He has no doubt regretted it eversince given that the evidence is absolutely overwhelming that 9/11 was an insidejob – a fact supported by a wide range of highly-relevant experts includingprofessional building engineers, architects and airline pilots. I bet the show’sproducers punched the air when Veitch ‘recanted’ because that was the idea, nota mature and unbiased investigation of the facts that included the views of theexperts in their field who have left the official story lying in a heap. I thinkthat one reason people still agree to take part in these BBC farces is thebelief that at least they will be able to get some truth across, however little;but what they need to appreciate is that anything they say which is reallyrelevant and powerful in undermining the official story will not make the showthat the public see. The BBC has control of the cutting room and the best wayfor anyone to make a statement about censorship and bias that. and the lies ofthe media system is to refuse to take part in any more of these insults tojournalism. The BBC is running a propaganda operation for the official versionof virtually everything, including the fake global warming scam, the EuropeanUnion and coverage of Israel and Palestine (Fig 620). Those at the core of theorganisation will be well aware of this while most of the staff play their partin the deceit while genuinely believing they are telling the truth and servingthe public interest. The latter are entrapped in a structure of insidiouscensorship in which insidious censors are themselves being insidiously censoredand programmed to believe that they are impartial or, as Fox News would put it,‘fair and balanced’. BBC ‘conspiracy’ producer Riete Oord must know that herseries is disgustingly biased and slanted because she would be off with thefairies if she doesn’t. At the very least of the least there are endlesscontradictions and holes in the official story of 9/11 and yet the mainstreammedia worldwide has hardly produced a single major article or documentarypointing this out. What are the chances of that if the policy is not deliberateand media organisations connected by the same hidden web?[../Images/00033.jpg]Figure 618: Would the media lie to you and censor the truth? Would a fish swimin the sea?[../Images/00410.jpg]Figure 619: On the road with a comedian fronting a comedy.[../Images/00274.jpg]Figure 620: Excuse me, sir, you won’t be needing that.[../Images/00364.jpg]Figure 621: BBC propaganda continues over Syria.The BBC has long been a thoroughly discredited organisation for those who havebothered to research the real background to world events and then watched theBBC, along with CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and all the others that report what youknow to be provable lies as indisputable fact. The BBC was exposed forpublishing a picture of rows of bodies taken in Iraq in 2003 and yet presentingthe dead as victims of the conflict in Syria (Fig 621). The BBC used the pictureto blame the Syrian Government for what it portrayed, as the corrupt andArchontic corporation sought to sell yet another war on behalf of its governmentmasters, something it has done so many times before. The print media is the samewith the world’s most famous newspapers and magazines little more thanpropaganda sheets to promote the Archontic blueprint for the world – The NewYork Times, The Washington Post, Time, Newsweek and a stream of papers andpublications worldwide are enemies of the people and enemies of truth. TheLondon Evening Standard blazed a picture on the front page purporting to be alarge crowd celebrating the bringing down of Saddam’s statue in Iraq during theinvasion in 2003, but it turned out to be a manipulated image with the samepeople included several times to make the crowd look far bigger than it reallywas (Fig 622). Even simple picture cropping can transform the perception of theviewer (Fig 623). Multiply this ten million times with regard to themanipulation potential of modern computer graphics and video techniques. Thescale of deceit has always been enormous, but today it is fantastic andall-pervasive. The advice of don’t believe what you read in the newspapersrequires an urgent update: Don’t accept anything unless you have checked it outfor yourself or, at the very least, the source has a long – a long – trackrecord of accuracy and authenticity. The world is so awash with lies thatfinding the truth is one hell of a challenge every day and the mainstream mediais overwhelmingly, though not yet entirely, an essential support-system for thisArchontic deceit. Intelligence agencies and the military have long infiltratedthe media to manipulate public perception. Watergate journalist Carl Bernsteinwrote an article for Rolling Stone in 1977 headed ‘The CIA and the Media’. Hesaid:[../Images/00308.jpg]Figure 622: Big crowd ... of the same people.[../Images/00095.jpg]Figure 623: Manipulation of perception is so easy.> Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were William> Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System [CBS], Henry Luce of Time Inc.,> Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times, Barry Bingham Sr. of the> Louisville Courier-Journal, and James Copley of the Copley News Services.> Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include the American> Broadcasting Company [ABC], the National Broadcasting Company [NBC], the> Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers,> Scripps-Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami> Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald-Tribune.

See thevideo Operation Hollywood: How The Pentagon Shapes And Censors The Movies onYouTube. The US military was exposed in 2011 for running an online ‘personamanagement service’ that allows military personnel to control up to ten (and therest) separate fake identities to make comments on the social media attackinganyone who questions the actions of authority and especially America. The ideais to manipulate conversations and discussions to undermine those exposing orquestioning the system and that each fake online persona has a convincingbackground, history and supporting details to allow US-based controllers tooperate false identities from their workstations ‘without fear of beingdiscovered by sophisticated adversaries’. The US military won’t be alone eitherand so when you see people like me attacked on forums, comment pages and thesocial media they are not always genuine but carefully posted by those now knownon the Internet as ‘trolls’ and ‘sock puppets’. Authorities that go to thoselengths to manipulate Hollywood and public discussions on the social media arenot going to have their hands on the mainstream media and a lot of the‘alternative’ media? Please.Personal experienceThe reporting and non-reporting of my major all-day event at the Wembley Arenain October 2012 provides many potent examples of the way the system distorts andsuppresses. For the mainstream media it was never going to be a case of askingwhy such a large number of people from all over the world and from all walks oflife would sit for an entire day listening to the information of someone the‘journalistic’ profession has dismissed for nearly 25 years as a mad man and a‘nutter’. Such an approach would demand that they be adult, mature, informed andquestioning of the norms that their minds are so programmed to serve. Not asingle one of those boxes is ticked when the mainstream media arrive on thescene with their stories and ‘treatments’ of events and people already writtenin their heads and agreed with their editorial bosses before they even leave theoffice. No, the only choice to make for these comatose ‘journalistic’manipulators and distorters of reality was whether to ignore that Wembley washappening at all or go yet again for more ridicule and dismissal. A few chosethe latter while the rest looked the other way. I have been pointing out for 30years that there is no difference between the so-called ‘gutter’ tabloid pressand the self-styled ‘intellectual’ we-are-not-your-average-gutter of the‘serious’ media. In the UK these are newspapers like the Independent, theGuardian, the Times and the Telegraph. The same applies in the United States tothe New York Times or the Washington Post and every country will be similar.They are all precisely the same mentality, but the ‘serious’ media use moresyllables to tell the same system-serving story. In fact, some of the mostmanipulative, stupid and childish articles about me over the years have comefrom these intellectual pigmies of the ‘serious press’ who are so self-deludedthat they believe in their own worldly-wisdom while they go about theirbewildered lives with no idea of what the world really is or where they reallyare. The ‘real’ world can only be accessed through the heart and right side ofthe brain while the overwhelming majority of mainstream journalists at alllevels of the folklore ‘gutter’ are serving a life-sentence in the cerebral lefthemisphere of words, structure, hierarchy and the time-space illusion. TheEnglish writer John Milton said: ‘Those who danced were thought to be quiteinsane by those who could not hear the music.’ And that sums it up, really. Mostjournalists cannot hear the music and so anyone dancing must be mad because allthey can hear is silence. Mainstream journalists cannot report the worlds orconcepts beyond the realms of the conscious mind because they can’t tap into themusic (information, insight, inspiration) that takes them beyond the consciousmind. They function only as software functions in a computer program byresponding and reacting according to pre-programmed order, design and datainput. In my case, Icke is mad and no other perception can breach the walls oftheir cell-like reality.‘Go and report that event with that crazy bloke, Icke.’‘Yessir, system activated ... Icke is mad, Icke is mad, I am a Dalek, I am aDalek ... system producing opening paragraph ... “Madman David Icke spoke to madpeople at Wembley Arena and confirmed that he is mad, new paragraph” ... I am aDalek, I am a Dalek ... exterminate ...’The world is now so crazy and the media so awash with automatons that this ismuch closer to the truth than it would seem.. The Los Angeles Times is reportedto be using an algorithm program to compile data in a way that can be publishedin the paper without input from a ‘journalist’. The report said that journalistKen Schwencke ‘has occasionally awakened ... to find his byline atop a newsstory he didn’t write’ because the ‘author was an algorithm he had created.Schwencke said: ‘I doubt that people who read our (web) posts ... realise theyalmost universally follow the same pattern ... I don’t think most people arethinking that robots are writing the news.’ Mmmmm, I wouldn’t bank on that. Ican give you a perfect example of this media bias and distortion in a sequenceof events that happened with regard to Express newspapers, publishers of theDaily and Sunday Express. It began a week before Wembley when I was asked tospeak with a freelance journalist for a story about my work that she wasoffering to the Sunday Express. It was a very rare experience for me because thejournalist was intelligent and informed and there was no doubt that the articlefor that Sunday’s paper was going to be fair and balanced. An editor at theExpress accepted the story and both the journalist and the commissioner of thearticle believed that it was going to be published. But when Sunday came, nostory. A week later, on the day of Wembley, an excuse for a ‘journalist’ on theDaily Express called David Robinson published a calculated attack headlined‘Utterly Bonkers’. Robinson never spoke to me (not that this would have made anydifference) and didn’t turn up at Wembley to see my information put together incontext. Instead he wrote the story from his office using newspaper cuttings andhis own innate bile and bias while no doubt following the orders of hissuperiors to write a ‘knocking piece’. So, to ensure the pay cheque at the endof the month, he did what daddy told him, as his like do every day all over theworld. Even if he had wanted to be fair and balanced (not a state of mind withwhich he is too familiar I would wager) then it would not have been allowed tohappen. This was Robinson’s opening line:> Today a sell-out Wembley crowd, and thousands globally, will spend a fortune> to hear ‘messiah’ David Icke’s day-long rant about ‘lizards’ who run the> world. And you thought HE was barking mad.The arrogance of these idiots is breathtaking. Only he is the decider of truthand reality – yes, a man working for the Daily Express for goodness sake whoknows nothing of my work except for what people exactly like him have written.His uninformed stupidity decides that not only must I be mad because hispea-sized perception cannot comprehend any possibility beyond the softwareprogram that he calls his ‘mind’; but anyone else who is open-minded andconscious enough to come and listen must also, by definition, be ‘barking mad’.What an insult he and his like are to the oh-so-rare real journalists who seekto tell the truth fairly and accurately within a profession which suchmentalities pollute to the core. Then there was ‘Susie Mesure’ from the’Independent’ on Sunday who turned up at Wembley after the first section of twoand half hours which put everything else that followed into context and thenleft well before the end to meet her ‘deadline’ for the next day. She wrote thatshe ‘didn’t get it’. What? She didn’t ‘get it’ in those circumstances? I amshocked. My flabber had never been so ghasted. How could that be? Wow. But thenwould any mainstream media ‘mind’ have got it under any circumstances given thescale of perception programming necessary to hold down a job in a profession inwhich a system mind is compulsory and almost nonnegotiable? Ms Mesure wrote:> To make matters worse I, as a newspaper reporter, am a member of exactly the> sort of crazed humanoid reptilian elite that David Icke is convinced is> running the world to the detriment of the human race, along with, and in no> particular order, Barack Obama, the Queen, Alan Greenspan, Mick Jagger and> Tony Blair.No, Ms Mesure. You are not ‘a member of exactly the sort of crazed humanoidreptilian elite that David Icke is convinced is running the world’. You are asoftware program that thinks it’s conscious. That’s all. This trash comes fromthe ‘Independent’ newspaper with its nose in the air proclaiming intellectualand moral superiority over most of the rest of its sick and sorry industry whenit is just as deep and drowning in the cesspit of misrepresentation and sheerignorance of the world from which all the daily imprints are spawned. Talk aboutthe arrogance of ignorance. Nor was Ms Mesure’s late arrival at Wembley aone-off. The same ’Independent’ on Sunday sent a bloke to an all-day talk I didyears ago and he said he was turning up half way through before reporting on mywork for the paper’s magazine. I said that unless he was there from the start Iwould not talk to him and so he arrived just after I began and spent most of therest of the day doing anything but actually listen. His ‘story’ was written inhis mind before he came and nothing I said would make any difference. He wasalso an extraordinarily stupid man, but then I guess he must have beenhead-hunted for the job which would explain it. Ms Mesure, as with much of thedaily waste of ink and paper that her professional spews out, insults heraudience by her apparent distain for accuracy. She wrote that I said people mockme because I left school at 15. I didn’t say that at all. She claimed that oneof my ‘minders’ spoke to her and asked if she was going to be ‘nasty’ to me. Idon’t have ‘minders’ and the person she spoke to was artist Neil Hague whorightly pointed out how ridiculous it was to turn up and ‘report’ an event afterthe absolutely essential first two and a half hours were over. But one point shemade, though not by intention, was telling: ‘He claims people mock him forleaving school at 15, when I – with my university degree – was left flummoxedbecause, try as I might, I couldn’t understand what he was saying.’ The firstpart is simply not true, as I said, but she is yet another example of howirrelevant the education system is along with most of her own profession. Havinga university degree or not is irrelevant to intelligence and understandingbeyond the realm of the programmed perceptions of the ‘education’ system and themainstream media. Ms Mesure has clearly been through the programming of both andhas become so adept at repeating rather than free-thinking that she has secureda university degree and a job in the ‘serious’ end of the mainstream media.Education is programming. True intelligence is innate – or not. I have met somany sleazy and mendacious reporters and television producers who have said theywere interested in my work but only wanted to take the piss. I remember a blokecoming from an operation called Liberty Bell Productions who said he wanted todo a serious interview but it turned out to be a piss-take programme voiced overby a chap called Clive Anderson who has made a career out of ridiculing people.Why he should go to that much trouble when all he needs to do is find a mirroris not clear to me. The money, I guess. But how frustrating it must be for themedia to think that they had left a corpse lying in the gutter nearly 25 yearsago and then realise all these years later that it had refused to expire and isnow talking to thousands of people at a time all over the world. I refused tospeak with the mainstream print media for many years because once you put one ofthese people between what you say and how it is reported you are almostcertainly wasting your time in terms of accuracy and fairness. I decided howeverto put my toe in the water again in April 2013 to see if anything had changedgiven what was happening with world events when I was approached by RupertMurdoch’s UK Sunday Times. I wasn’t in the least bit optimistic, but I did soout of sheer curiosity and it soon became clear that nothing had changedwhatsoever as they despatched a bloke to my home called William Storr. He was inmy experience a compendium and personification of every reason why I stoppedtalking to the mainstream print media and most of the rest. It comes tosomething when the photographer sent along with him was as unimpressed at hisattitude and behaviour as I was. You have seen how much evidence that I presentin this book alone never mind all the others. There can be few if any books everwritten with more interconnected facts and sources across the whole spectrum ofhuman experience, ancient and modern; but of course and as usual Storr had notbothered to read any of my books before arriving to conduct a major interviewthat I was told would run to four or five pages in the paper’s magazine. Theidea that you would turn up to interview an author, especially of my uniquematerial, without even skimming through, let alone reading, a single book isextraordinary, but he thought he could do that and still pontificate and judgematerial he had never read. He even laughed at the very thought that he wouldhave read one of my books. When I challenged him on this he said ‘but you havewritten so many’. What that had to do with it I never did work out. Storr couldnot grasp what I said about my information being compiled from a tapestry ofendless sources from insiders, ancient and modern research, official documents,cultural accounts and people who have had personal experience of the phenomenaand structures of control that I write about in such detail. The books weresitting there with all the sources and detailed background information and hewas demanding that I give him it all verbally when it is the tapestry that makesthe case. At one point he stood and shouted at me: ‘You have not given me oneexample of where you get your information from – come on give me one, give meone.’ I had just told him at length the story about Christine Fitzgerald, thefriend of Princess Diana, as an example of thousands of separate sources butthat was dismissed as irrelevant. He decided that she hadn’t really meantreptiles when she mentioned the word and was using a metaphor. You only have toread her direct quotes from earlier to see exactly what she meant – reptiles inthe literal sense. Storr had not read even one of my books and so had not readthe quote before deciding what it meant. The fact that he could believe that Iwould talk to her for hours and not know that she was talking literally is justlaughable. This was followed by Storr’s revelation that ‘you are just takingevents that happen and making them fit your theory’ while ignoring the ratherrelevant fact that I had predicted events that he was talking about in my bookslong before they actually happened. Oh, but he hadn’t read any of them. He cameout with the usual ‘but you can’t prove by the scientific method that reptiliansexist’ and I found out later that he writes books that target ‘heretics’ whochallenge mainstream ‘scientific’ dogma. I could quite easily have been talkingto Dogma ‘my understanding of quantum mechanics is foggy’ Dawkins or Christopher‘Where am I?’ French. In terms of mentality I was. French is another who hadnever read my books before dismissing and condemning them and there is a simplereason this. The starting point for people like French and Storr is that what Iam saying cannot possibly be true and so what is the point of reading about it?The possibility that what I say could have any validity is never considered andtheir only question with regard to me is why I am saying what I do. Am I mad oram I conning people? Storr asked me a series of questions about my father andthis reminded me of the TV psychiatrist years ago with a textbook mind whodecided that I have done what I have because of some aspect of my relationshipwith my father. They laugh at me but I find them hysterical. The American writerDerek Bok put it very well when he said: ‘The greatest ignorance is to rejectsomething you know nothing about.’ The ‘fair and balanced’ Storr tried to turnmy views on science against me by pointing out that I had bottles of pills inthe kitchen and I must have been taking drugs for my arthritis. I pointed outthat I had never taken drugs for the arthritis at any time since it came at theage of 15 and that the bottles of ‘pills’ were all natural supplements. Silence.The arrogance of ignorance is always shocking to behold and meeting Storr was ahorrible and depressing experience, making me realise that the mainstream mediais still going round and round in circles on the way to disappearing up its ownarse amid gathering state censorship aimed at deleting even the modicum of realjournalism that still survives. My toe was out of the water as fast as it wentin terms of talking to the mainstream print media and, unless I know the personto be open-minded and fair, I will never speak to any of them again because itis a waste of my time. It took ages for Storr’s article about me to come out,but one Sunday morning when I saw an email in my inbox slugged ‘That reporter isa close-minded fuckwit!’ I knew instinctively that it had been published atlast. I can at least thank my experience with Storr for the motivation to launchThe People’s Voice and bypass the mainstream media.What’s the point?My question is what on earth do these people think is the relevance to the humanplight of reporting the system for the system from the perspective of the systemthrough the bought-and-paid-for media of the system? Okay, it pays the bills andsometimes lets them see the world, but what is the relevance of what they do?Wars are reported and sold largely as the system demands and the owners of thenewspapers and radio and television stations dictate. Talk to real journalistsanywhere in the world and they could scream at the restrictions they are forcedto deal with. The case of CNN’s Amber Lyon who left the Corrupt News Networkafter executive censorship of her reporting in Bahrain is one of the few thatcome to light when untold numbers of journalists worldwide work in the sameenvironment and worse. What is the point of reporting the system for the systemwhen the system has your most basic freedoms and those of your children andgrandchildren in its sights? What is the relevance of what they do? There needsto be a rebellion of real journalists as there does of everyone else. Thebiggest challenge to that is how few real journalists there are. I mean, wheredo you start with people like William Storr, David Robinson and Susie Mesure?They don’t even get there is a problem, let alone who is behind it and their ownpart in perpetuating it. Like most of their colleagues worldwide they not onlydon’t investigate conspiracies they condemn and ridicule those who do. If youwant to mock someone call him or her a ‘conspiracy theorist’. The definition of‘conspiracy’ is simply this: ‘An agreement between two or more persons to commita crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.’ On that basis theworld is drowning in conspiracies. Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are notfound; the 9/11 and global warming official stories are a scientific joke; andcoordinated banking scandals galore are constantly coming to light. But, no,conspiracies still don’t exist. A reporter called Tom Peck on the daily versionof the Independent opened a preview to my Wembley event with the line: ‘They saythat even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day – and maybe the sameis true of conspiracy theorists.’ He was referring to the fact that I wascalling out British media and BBC ‘star’ Jimmy Savile as a paedophile andnecrophiliac long before confirmation of the story broke in the mainstream. Allthe other conspiracies exposed in my books over the years that have sincehappened or come to light pass these people by because they have never readthem. The headline to Peck’s story even referred to Wembley as my ‘comeback’. Inever went away – they did. Where have these people been? Focussed on the littledot they call the world, that’s where. But the irrelevance of the mainstreammedia is that, in terms of the big picture of what is happening to humansociety, their clocks are never right, not even once a day, never mind twice.They are the product of system-programming and so most cannot breach the wallsof their downloaded software to grasp the true and extraordinary nature andscale of what is behind world events and our daily lives.The irony is that the mainstream media denies any conspiracy while that veryconspiracy is creeping up on them, too. The Leveson inquiry into the Britishmedia led by the government-appointed judge Lord Leveson (Rothschild Zionist)was designed from the start to curb the freedom of the media (Fig 644). The‘inquiry’ was justified by the widespread hacking of the telephones ofcelebrities and people in the news by the Murdoch-owned News of the World whichled to the paper closing down. Yes, what happened was outrageous, but the pointis that the practice was breaking laws already in place and people have beenarrested under those very laws for what they are alleged to have done. There wasno need for any new laws to curb the media, but that is what the Archon networkswant to do and the excuse had been created with vociferous support from LabourParty leader Ed Miliband (Rothschild Zionist) and, despite the feignedopposition, Prime Minister David Cameron (Rothschild Zionist). These twoconcluded a ‘deal’ on new laws in Miliband’s office with RothschildZionist-sponsored Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats and the organisationHacked Off which was dominated by celebrities whose phones had been hacked andvocally led by the self-obsessed one-part actor Hugh Grant. Cameron’srepresentative at the meeting was Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin(Rothschild Zionist), who has worked for the Rothschilds. A new organisation topolice the media was set up by a ‘royal charter’ which is a letter from theQueen that creates public bodies or professional institutions without the needfor legislation. This is how the Bank of England and the BBC were established.The monarch has no power, right? It is purely ceremonial and brings in thetourists? The new laws also include Internet sites like my own which are a primetarget for suppression and closure by the Archon networks. If those talking liesand bollocks are not to be exposed as such they have to censor those who can seethe lies and the bollocks. T’was always so. The stitch up of the British mediais not about stopping the often atrocious behaviour of the media towardsindividuals and those who have no redress. It is to protect the system, theconspiracy and those who run the system from legitimate investigation andexposure. The Leveson ‘inquiry’ and the campaign for media laws in generalheavily featured an organisation called Common Purpose which has appeared manytimes in my books and is the speciality of researcher Brian Gerrish atukcolumn.org (Fig 625). Common Purpose is seriously involved in thetransformation of British society and further afield through the taxpayer-funded‘training programmes’ to prepare public officials for the ‘postindustrial,post-democratic society’. Anything Common Purpose is campaigning for is theglobal agenda. One of many sinister Leveson proposals was to give police newpowers to seize confidential material from journalists and name theirwhistle-blower sources. This is aimed at blocking insider whistle-blowers whohave the proof to expose the corruption of the state, and destroying what isleft of investigative journalism. The leaked computer disc that detailed andexposed the incredible corruption by Members of Parliament in stealingtaxpayer’s money through illegal expenses would have been subject to these lawchanges had they been in place at the time. Padraig Reidy of Index onCensorship, said: ‘These measures, if implemented, could have a real effect onjournalism, free speech and the entire climate of freedom in the UK.’ I takeyour point, mate, but that is the idea and what climate of freedom is there anylonger in the UK? The European Union’s ‘High Level Group on Media Freedom andPluralism’ has called for the establishment of media councils in every EUcountry to be monitored by the unelected European Commission which will have thepower to fine, censor and even dismiss journalists if it sees fit. ‘The nationalmedia councils should follow a set of European-wide standards and be monitoredby the Commission to ensure that they comply with European values [controls]’,the group said. Other recommendations include the media councils being staffedwith ‘a politically and culturally balanced and socially diverse membership’which would be nominated by government and not the media, and for libel lawsextended uniformly across the EU, together with an Internet user database thatwould identify and track ‘those responsible for harming others through themedia, even in the online space’. You are looking at fascist/communistcensorship dictated by unelected bureaucrats on the very people in the media whonow say there is no conspiracy. MP Douglas Carswell said that the plans revealedthat ‘the European project is ultimately incompatible with the notion of a freesociety’. The ‘High Level Group’ in typically Orwellian fashion called thedocument proposing to demolish media freedom: ‘A free and pluralistic media tosustain European democracy.’ What is left of the free media is being targetedall over the world through the coordinated Archontic networks with thealternative media on the Internet facing censorship laws through spuriousexcuses such as terrorism (as usual), pornography and copyright. Institutions ofthe mainstream media are even supporting this because of the inroads thealternative Internet media has made in their audiences. They can’t see that boththey and the alternatives are being targeted by the same force for the sameends. Archontic governments are desperately trying to put the genie back in thebottle by targeting those who question and expose authority. Google has admittedthat government attempts to censor content have grown sharply:[../Images/00269.jpg]Figure 624: Rothschild Zionist Leveson in fancy dress and wig wants to gag themedia.[../Images/00240.jpg]Figure 625: The Common Purpose connection to media censorship.> In more places than ever, we’ve been asked by governments to remove political> content that people post on our services. In this particular time period, we> received court orders in several countries to remove blog posts criticizing> government officials or their associates.At the same time the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been exposed forusing tax investigations to specifically target ‘patriot groups’ which challengethe lies of government and demanding that the names of all donors and volunteerswere revealed. The IRS, like the Supreme Court, is a political organisation inservice to the Satanists. How much governments care about ‘media freedom’ can beseen with the revelation in 2013 that the US Justice [inversion] Department ofAttorney General Eric ‘I speak therefore I lie’ Holder secretly obtained monthsof telephone records of reporters and editors at Associated Press. An APexecutive described this as a ‘massive and unprecedented intrusion’ into hownews organisations gather the news, but, in truth, this will be far morecommonplace than anyone imagines. If you want an idea of where they want to golook no further than magazine editor Somyot Pruksakasemsuk who was jailed forten years for two articles that made ‘negative reference’ to the Thai royalfamily. The European Union said the verdict ‘seriously undermines the right tofreedom of expression and press freedom’ and damaged ‘Thailand’s image as a freeand democratic society’ when those hypocrites want to go down the same road.The mainstream media say there is no Orwellian conspiracy and ridicule those whosay there is, but here they are being entrapped by that very conspiracy. If itwasn’t so serious it would be funny, but in the circumstances we face funny itisn’t. Pathetic would be more like it."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00112.jpg]Archon Alternative MediaPatience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. Forif you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurtyou. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with greatwrongs, and they will then be powerless against your peace of mind.Leonardo da VinciThe ‘alternative’ media which is almost entirely based on the Internet has madeincredible strides in the last few years. When I started out on this road in1990 alternative news was virtually non-existent, but today there are anincredible number of websites and writers exposing the global conspiracy in allits multiple forms. This is fantastic – the more the better, I say, with somereservations to which I will come in a moment.The effect on the mainstream corporate-owned media has been devastating withonce major ‘news’ (propaganda) sources like CNN and their ilk losing a seriouspercentage of their former audience and many newspapers struggling to evensurvive. There is a great deal about the alternative media that is excellent andprovides essential balance for the bias and mendacity of the corporate and statemedia, but there is also much about the ‘alternative’ that reminds me of themainstream version. I shake my head often when I see ‘alternative’ writerscondemning the ‘sheeple’ for believing what the system tells them while they arepromoting Christianity and patriotism – both of which are Archon creations toenslave the minds and perceptions of the people. It’s the same with allreligions. How is believing a minister preaching fairy tales from a pulpit anydifferent from believing a president speaking fairy tales from a lectern? Idon’t see the difference myself. They all involve blindly and unquestioninglyaccepting lies as truth and falsehood as reality. By patriotism I don’t meanloving the land where you live, but buying the fake history, fake morality andfake superiority that goes with it and a fake sense of who you are and where youcome from. The conspiracy is founded on the hijacking and programming of humanperception and it doesn’t care which belief system limits your sense of self andreality so long as at least one does. The alternative media spans a wholespectrum of views and opinions from only barely perceivable differences from the‘norm’ to, in my case, a total revaluation of reality itself which questions andoverturns virtually every pillar of experienced human perception. This is whyfrom where I am standing I see much of the alternative media as little differentfrom the despised mainstream variety. I am abused, laughed at and dismissed bygreat swathes of the alternative media in exactly the same way that mainstreamhacks have done for decades. Why? Because what I am saying is way beyond whatmainstream and most alternative writers and readers choose to believe is eitherhappening or possible. People can be very ill at ease with ‘different’ andinstant abuse and dismissal invariably follows.[../Images/00060.jpg]Figure 626: Jesse Ventura in typical pose.Boxes come in all shapes and sizes and some even as big as the ‘alternative’(yeah, right) Jesse Ventura whose closed mind and modus operandi are nodifferent to CNN, Fox or the BBC (Fig 626). Ventura and his team from TimeWarner (owners of CNN) work for the thoroughly miss-named truTV and sought to dome as much damage as possible in 2012 with their childish manipulation andoutrageous lies. This both gave me confirmation that I must be seriously on theright track and showed me that ‘alternative’ people like Ventura are just asdisingenuous as any mainstream tabloid hack. The basis of his attack was thatreptilian entities cannot exist because ‘Jesse Ventura hasn’t seen one’. Oh,okay, I suppose we’d better all just go home now the oracle of all existence hasspoken. I could have been speaking to William Storr on The Sunday Times quiteeasily because the mentality was the same. Former wrestler and Minnesotagovernor Ventura has become a bit of a poster boy for the Christian Patriot wingof the conspiracy research arena for his Time Warner (very alternative) show,Conspiracy Theory. What I found fascinating is that the show has treated everyother conspiracy researcher with respect when talking about the ‘mainstream’ ofconspiracy but when they came to me and entities manipulating this reality fromanother reality immediately they screamed ‘destroy him’. But Ventura and hisbrainless mob will have to increase their level of intelligence by at least amillion-fold to get even close to that and from what I saw I don’t see ithappening myself. They were so desperate to do me and my work as much harm asthey could that they said basically I was conning people for money. Theyestimated from no facts whatsoever, they just made it up, that I must be earning$2 million dollars a year. It was extraordinary nonsense, just a figure pickedout of the air to do as much damage as possible. I live in a one-bedroomed flatand Ventura who was reading the script has a near mansion with its own grounds.But then truth was not the point with ‘truTV’. I got out of bed the morning heinterviewed me after a week of severe ill-health during a speaking tour ofAustralia and America that left me running on fumes. The interview was conductedin the short time between arriving at a speaking venue in Cleveland and speakingfor the next nine hours and then edited in the finished programme to make melook as bad as possible. I have given a quarter of a century of my life so farto do what I do but these people just walk in, think they know it all and haveno respect whatsoever for the work of others. When I said that Ventura shouldstay and listen to the presentation put together over nine hours to see what Iam saying, he said ‘Nine hours?’ and left before the event even started. I didhave sympathy, though, because I doubt that he has the attention span of nineminutes. He wasn’t interested in the truth only his own agenda. This is the‘alternative’ media?? Ventura didn’t even have the decency or respect to meet mebeforehand and insisted that the first time we met was when the cameras wererunning and he strode in like something out of Shrek. This tells you somethingimmediately. He had made his mind up about me without meeting me or readinganything I have written. All he knew is that I was talking about reptilianentities and that was enough for the Brain of America. Ventura is a textbookleft-brain inmate. Once again we see the same sequence with mainstream,‘alternatives’ as with the mainstream media itself: what I am saying cannot betrue because their reality bubbles can’t comprehend even the possibility andthat leaves them with the same two choices. Either I am mad or conning people tomake money. Yes, I have taken a quarter of a century of abuse and ridicule tolive in a one-bedroomed flat because I am doing it for the money. Most of themainstream media go for ‘crazy’ with a few ‘he’s making lots of money’ here andthere while Ventura took the route of ‘it must be for money’. They are sopredictable it is hilarious. I don’t see what people like Ventura bring to thetable in terms of new information and insight. I see what they take from thetable but not what they bring. Ventura has no idea about the conspiracy as itreally is and yet he has been presented as an expert who goes on CNN to be hadfor breakfast, dinner and tea by even people of the brain-power of Piers Morganbecause Ventura doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The Sandy Hook schoolshooting was the most blatant Problem-Reaction-Solution to justify disarmingAmericans at the time when US law domestic enforcement is being armed withweaponry and even tanks and armoured vehicles previously only seem in themilitary; but Ventura made a public statement denouncing suggestions that it wasa staged event. This man fronts up a series called Conspiracy Theory? What ishis game? He has said that he might run for president. I do hope not. Hasn’tAmerica has suffered enough?Bubbles exposing bubblesVentura is a blueprint John Wayne wannabe – the tough, no-nonsense testosteronejunky real American hero fighting for justice. Or, at least that is hisself-image. Wayne Wannabes play the tough, but fair good guys with a heart ofgold. They are fighting the bad guys in their own minds for the ‘best country inthe world’. John Wayne is the personification of a blueprint that ChristianPatriots have been following since they first plundered the lands of NorthAmerica and shipped in the slaves from Africa. Ironically, the descendants ofmany of those slaves that were imprisoned and worked to death by ChristianPatriotism have themselves since been recruited by both. John Wayne was an actorwho never saw a gun fired in combat and yet became a war hero and cowboy hero byplaying those same parts over and over (Fig 627). It was all an act, anillusion, and that’s appropriate, I guess, because the blueprint he spawned – orexploited – is equally illusory. There are many wonderful people in America andhave been throughout its history. I have been fortunate to meet a large numberover the years, but John Wayne America is the prison of prisons for those thatbuy into it. The Wayne blueprint can still be seen in the perception of Americantroops fighting the bad guys in faraway lands for the good of all when they arereally there to plunder countries and resources and pepper-bomb civilians forthe Archontic networks that seek to destroy America, John Wayne or otherwise.Support the troops – they fight for good, for God and America. Oh yes, God andAmerica. These are indivisible in the mind of the Christian Patriot and the JohnWayne blueprint. God blessed America and made it what it is. Was this the sameGod that made Jews his Chosen People? Is he schizophrenic or just a two-timer? Areally extreme Christian Patriot conspiracy guy told me once that the ‘Indians’were only looking after the lands of America until God was ready to give them tohis chosen white people. We were talking next to a massive white cross on a farmin Arizona and I said that I didn’t know which would be my biggest nightmare, aworld run by the conspiracy families or a world run by people like him. TheChristian Patriot mentality, which dominates a significant percentage of thealternative media in the United States, is imprisoned by its belief systemsevery bit as much as those that it dubs the ‘sheeple’. Yes, many can see thatthere is some sort of conspiracy going on to destroy the America they have known– or think they have – but they still perceive this mostly in terms ofleft/liberal = bad; and right/conservative = good. Those who have gone beyondthis to see that there is a one party state masquerading as political choice arestill enslaved by the biblical version of all possibility and they are going tochange nothing substantially for the better until these prisons of the mind aredismantled and the blind followers of Christianity and all religions realisethey have been had. Remember that the eagle which Patriots look up to as asymbol of God’s own country is really a phoenix, a symbol used by secretsocieties and satanic groups for thousands of years. The stars on the Americanflag are satanic pentagrams as are those on the flag of the European Union. TheFounding Fathers who framed the US Constitution were absolutely dominated byFreemasons answering ultimately to the Mother Lodge in London and anotherAmerican hero of the time, Benjamin Franklin, was a practicing Satanist andclose friend and associate of the very British Establishment from which the‘Fathers’ were seeking freedom. It was a sleight of hand to replace overtcontrol of the United States by a foreign power with covert control. Thistakeover of America was described by high occult initiate Sir Francis Bacon inhis book, The New Atlantis, published in the 17th century. Christian Patriothero Thomas Jefferson is widely quoted for his advocacy of freedom and yet heowned some 200 black slaves. The United States Declaration of Independence onJuly 4th, 1776, speaks grandly about it being self-evident that all men (notwomen?) are created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator withcertain unalienable Rights such as ‘Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness’.I am not sure that this would be very self-evident to black slaves and NativeAmericans or the crushed working and increasingly middle classes today. TheUnited States was founded from the start on hypocritical bullshit and thisschism of hypocrisy has delivered the same distortion of perception through tothis day which equates bombing cities of civilians with protecting them fromviolence and mass murder by unmanned drones with fighting for justice andfreedom. The American Establishment has been so skilled at peddling hypocrisyand bullshit as morality and truth because no doubt they learned from theexperts, the British Establishment, the global home of hypocrisy and bullshit(see ‘British Empire’).[../Images/00121.jpg]Figure 627: John Wayne – the soul of Patriot America.The very substantial closed-minded element of the alternative media may be onestep ahead of the mainstream in that it recognises that some sort of conspiracyis going on, but it is still light years off the pace when it comes tounderstanding the nature and depth of that conspiracy. This is where they muststay until minds are opened and concrete belief systems dispensed with. So manytimes I have been dismissed when detailing provable facts about illusory‘physical’ reality because ‘he doesn’t believe in Jesus’. This is the criteriafor deciding the credibility of absolutely everything to these people and theyare the same ones who say that the ‘sheeple’ must wake up. Mainstream ‘science’is another of the boing-boing polarities that is played off against religion toinstigate a fraudulent ‘debate’ over whether black (creation by God) or white(creation by cosmic coincidence) is the explanation of reality and where ‘we’came from. Give people two equally false possibilities and whichever one theychoose their perception is lassoed. There is another section of the alternativemedia that takes mainstream science as its belief-marker when pondering on thepossible and I am dismissed and ridiculed by these people for that reason.Mainstream ‘science’ is just another religion, another bricks-and-mortar beliefsystem designed to hold back the waters of true understanding. Anything with‘mainstream’ in front of it is going to be that way – science, media, medicine,all of them, because this is why they exist. Now we have a mainstream ofconspiracy research going round and round. It refuses to go deeper in the rabbithole when this would mean ditching religious, ‘scientific’ and cultural beliefs.Thank goodness there is now emerging an alternative to the alternative thatdoesn’t conform to religious, scientific or cultural belief systems and norms,but looks at everything on its merits. It constantly asks the key questions:Does what I am hearing make sense of reality and the world? What is the evidenceto support what is being said? And does this feel right to me? Information andintuitive knowing are the guiding forces, not preconceived ideas to whicheverything must conform or be discarded. This approach to seeking greaterunderstanding is open-minded, free-minded and clear-minded. It is unfettered andunrestrained in where it will go and what it will investigate by religious,political, scientific or nationalistic and cultural belief. It can see thatthere are other forces at work beyond those that we can see and that here liesthe real story of why the world is as it is.The ‘come and save me’ diversionA friend forwarded me an email and asked what I thought of the contents. I hadseen it all before many times. It was summarising the claims of an anonymous‘whistle-blower’ who called himself ‘Drake’, which is a form of duck. There wasalso a game in Olde England called ‘ducks and drakes’ dating from the 16thcentury in which flat stones were thrown across the water in a way that madethem bounce before sinking. It is known today as ‘skimming’. The term ‘playingducks and drakes’ became a metaphor to describe behaviour that wasirresponsible, reckless and involved ‘squandering wealth or throwing awaysomething of value’. There are other common phrases inspired by ducks, includingsitting duck and lame duck. I also see that the word ‘duck’ derives from the OldEnglish dūce, or ‘diver’, a derivative of the verb dūcan, which means ‘to duck,bend down low as if to get under something, or dive.’ Put the two together andyou get the phrase to ‘duck and dive’ (‘to be involved in many differentactivities, especially ones which are not honest’). It all seems ratherappropriate to me when I read the claims and assertions of ‘Drake’ who got mostpublicity on an Internet radio show presented by an American called DavidWilcock. The gist of it was that ‘good guys’ in the US military and intelligencecommunity were about to make mass arrests of the ‘bad guys’. As Hitler said,keep your disinformation real simple so anyone can understand it. Good guys andbad guys is perfect. Meanwhile, over in Japan, another alternative media man,Benjamin Fulford, was saying something similar about secret societies in the FarEast moving in on the ‘bad guys’ and outlined his claims in interviews withWilcock. I highlight this story briefly because it is a wonderful example of thenaïvety, self-indulgence and disinformation that is spread through thealternative media to divert and misguide. This is often done by people whobelieve it to be true although the original source will know that it is not. Ihave been asked many times about these ‘coming mass arrests of the Illuminati’,or even been told about them as if they were fact by those repeating the claimsof ‘Drake’, Wilcock and Fulford. This continues even when deadline afterdeadline demanding that the Illuminati players give themselves up ‘or else’ isfollowed by no giving up and no ‘or else’. Fulford said that his ‘good guys’were ‘The White Dragon Society’ which intended to arrest those behind the globalconspiracy and direct events during a transition to a world of peace andprosperity. One day they may be arrested, but this wasn’t it. As a websiteposting said of a radio show involving David Wilcock and Benjamin Fulford inSeptember 2011:> Ben tells David how the ‘Meeting of 57’ representatives from 57 different> countries over the world (about a week ago now) really put a hurting in the> members left in the Evil Cabal. Yes, it seems that countries from all over the> world are jumping ship and turning to side with the Jedi Knights (The White> Dragon Society ... the good guys!). People are tired of the Evil Empire and> want free of them now it seems.The White Dragon Society was described in this way by Benjamin Fulford, again in2011:> We are an international group of financiers, military men, people in> Intelligence agencies, and in secret organisations as well as journalists and> ‘regular citizens’ who have been disgusted by the never-ending wars caused by> the military-industrial complex.Fulford said that the intention was to release all the money currently spent onwars to end poverty and environmental destruction ‘in months’ once they gettheir hands on government dosh. This alone was a ludicrous time-scale given thelogistics of circulating money on this magnitude and putting it into action to‘eliminate poverty’. Fulford said that the White Dragon Society would alsorelease suppressed technology including free-energy technology that works withnatural energetic fields to produce energy at virtually no cost and requireslittle or no energy input. ‘It would allow every one of us to live the life of amillionaire’, he says. This was the crux of the Drake-Wilcock-Fulford scenario:‘Good guys’ within government and military and a coalition of strange groupsgive the elite families a deadline and if they don’t surrender to authority(they haven’t at the time of writing) then the ‘good guys’ are going in to massarrest them and take over the transitional running of government and themilitary (they haven’t at the time of writing). Here’s a question: why did‘Drake’ remain anonymous when he appeared in interviews with Wilcock? Forprotection? Are we really to believe that ‘they’ can’t recognise his voice ortrace where he is speaking from - i.e. who he is and where he lives? Or thatthis can’t happen in the hours that Wilcock said that he has spoken to him onthe phone? Why did ‘Drake’ come out and say what he and his associates plannedto do and so give the alleged targets so much time to prepare? Why didn’t theyjust go in and do it? He even said that they would tell people 24 hours inadvance that they were moving in for mass arrests so that this fact can ‘goviral’ on the Internet; but this would have given the targets 24-hour’s notice,too. Why? Few seemed to ask these basic questions because they were too busycheering and saying ‘thank goodness, we are all going to be saved’. Names on the‘must get’ list apparently included Henry Kissinger; Father George Bush; BoyGeorge Bush; David Rockefeller; Jay Rockefeller; Dick Cheney; Warren Buffet;George Soros; Bill Gates; Bill Clinton; Hillary Clinton; members of the JPMorgan family, the Vanderbilt family, the Rothschilds, the Warburgs, the Britishroyal family and the Queen; the Pope; US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke;US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner; Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein; JP MorganCEO Jamie Dimon; former Bank of America CEO Kenneth D Lewis and Citigroup CEOVikram Pandit. Fulford wrote in February, 2012:> The group that claims to have started the American, French and Russian> revolutions state they have issued a March 31st deadline to the committee of> 300 [said to be part of the Rothschild control structure], according to their> spokesman ‘Alexander Romanoff’. In addition, Prince Harry has been in touch> with the group and has agreed to take over control of the British Royal family> from Queen Elizabeth.This prompts another question: if it was true that Harry had contacted them andmade this commitment – he didn’t, of course, but let’s say he did – why wouldyou make this public and drop the guy right in it? I mean, the whole thing wasabsolutely bizarre. Pinch me, please. Ouch. My god, it’s not a dream. Would thisbe the same Queen and royal family which, having failed to report to the localconstabulary to say ‘it’s a fair cop, guv’ within Fulford’s deadline afterdeadline, somehow managed to appear day after day amid orgiastic mass publicworship during the Diamond Jubilee rituals in which they were protected byenough troops, silly uniforms notwithstanding, to invade a country? I do believeit would. The alleged ‘Grand Master’ of what they call the ‘Gnostic Illuminati’(the good guys if you are not concentrating) was one Alexander Romanov whoclaimed to be a descendent of the mass-murdered Romanovs, the second and last‘royal’ dynasty in Russia which ruled from 1613 until the revolution of 1917when the monarchy was abolished. This was made permanent by allegedly killingthem all in a frenzy of violence. In doing so, one tyranny was followed byanother called Soviet Communism. The ‘White Dragons’ claimed via Fulford to bethe ‘good guy’ bloodlines and secret societies and not like the ‘bad guy’variety. The Rothschild controlled-and-funded Bolsheviks in Russia said much thesame in a political sense when they replaced the Romanovs, but violence andtyranny begets violence and tyranny when its advocates come to power throughviolence and tyranny. ‘No, honest, our violence and tyranny is good violence andtyranny.’ I was just a little confused with all this stuff about the WhiteDragon Society when Fulford was saying the same a few years ago about a BlackDragon Society, but then I read that Black changed its name to White. Well, theysay a change is as good as a rest. Fulford said this about the Black Dragons in2009:> The Black Dragon Society has been re-activated. The Black Dragon Society> reaches into intelligence agencies, governments, crime syndicates, financial> institutions etc. around the planet. Unlike other secret societies such as the> Freemasons, the Black Dragon Society is not united by fear but rather by> friendship, trust and shared values.> It is actively seeking to overthrow the New World Order in order to promote a> campaign to permanently end war, poverty and environmental destruction. It> also seeks to actively implement technology, such as free energy, that was> suppressed by the oil and nuclear loving control freaks of the N.W.O. The> society went underground after World War 2 and has now reactivated itself to> stop the genocidal plans of the N.W.O. thugs.> The society includes as its members top people at MI6, the Pentagon, the NSA> [National Security Agency], the Japanese military/intelligence community, the> KGB, the Serbian secret police, martial arts societies, the Yakuza, the triads> and others. They are allied again with the Red and Green [‘dragons’> presumably]. They can, if necessary, mobilize over 100 million fighters in all> regions of the planet on short notice.Would you want the world run by these people from the very intelligencecommunities (the same one at the very highest level) that serve the interests ofthe very Rothschild-Rockefeller-Windsor cabal that these ‘dragons’ and martialartists are supposed to be challenging? The Yakuza, also known as Gokudō, aremembers of ‘traditional’ (long-time) crime syndicates in Japan which the policecall Bōryokudan, or ‘violence group’. The Yakuza refer to themselves as ‘ninkyōdantai’, or ‘chivalrous organisations’. Ahhh, bless ‘em. Do they bow, open doorsand exchange pleasantries before they cut your balls off, then? ‘Chivalrous’ isdefined as having ‘the qualities of gallantry and honour attributed to an idealknight’. Okay, so what is an ideal ‘knight’ of the Yakuza? Someone who gallantlyand honourably empties your pockets and parts you from your manhood. There wereapparently some 90,000 members worldwide in 2009 and so crime and tyranny(sorry, saving the world from tyranny) clearly feeds the ATM to the point ofobesity. Then there are the Triads which were mentioned by Fulford. These aremore angels of light blowing trumpets. Well, blowing dynamite, anyway. The namedescribes a vast and intricate network of Chinese organised crime that operatesin China (especially Hong Kong), Vietnam, Macau, Taiwan and worldwide hiddenwithin the Chinese populations of the United States, Canada, Australia, NewZealand and Britain, to name only a few. Here we have yet anotherstrictly-enforced hierarchy of gluttonous greed based on fear and secrecy. ThisInternet article describes their structure:> Triads use numeric codes to distinguish between ranks and positions within the> gang; the numbers are inspired by Chinese numerology based on the I> Ching.’489’ refers to the ‘Mountain’ or ‘Dragon’ Master (or ‘Dragon Head’),> while 438 is used for the ‘Deputy Mountain Master’, the Mountain Master’s> proxy, ‘Incense Master’, who oversees inductions into the Triad, and> ‘Vanguard’, who assists the Incense Master.’426’ refers to a ‘military> commander’, also known as a ‘Red Pole’, overseeing defensive and offensive> operations, while ‘49’ denotes the position of ‘soldier’ or rank-and-file> member. [Does this relate to the San Francisco 49ers, or am I getting confused> again?]> The ‘White Paper Fan’ (415) provides financial and business advice, and the> ‘Straw Sandal’ (432) functions as a liaison between different units. ‘25’> refers to an undercover law enforcement agent or spy from another triad, and> has become popularly used in Hong Kong as a slang for ‘informant’. ‘Blue> Lanterns’ are uninitiated members, equivalent to Mafia associates and, as> such, do not have a number designation.The Triads are the same deal as royalty and the secret society network whichkeeps the bloodline families where they are. They are another hierarchy ofseized and imposed control using fear and occult knowledge about the power ofnumbers and vibration. These are the people that Fulford, verbally supported byWilcock and ‘Drake’, was trying to sell to people as their liberators. Shit, ifthat’s liberation goodness knows what tyranny must be like. The Triads andsimilar groups also have their initiation and sacrifice rituals, the same asthose they say they oppose. This is a description of the Triad ritual:> Similar to the Italian mafia or the Japanese yakuza, Triad members tend to be> subject to initiation ceremonies. A typical ceremony takes place at an altar> dedicated to Guan Yu, with incense and an animal sacrifice, usually a chicken,> pig or goat. After drinking a mixture of wine and blood of the animal or the> candidate, the member will pass beneath an arch of swords while reciting the> triad’s oaths. The paper on which the oaths are written will be burnt on the> altar to confirm the member’s obligation to perform his duties to the gods> [those made from ‘luminous fire’]. Three fingers on the left hand will be> raised as a binding gesture.Oh really? How about two? But no, don’t be cynical, please. Fulford said thatthis menagerie of mega crooks and mega killers share ‘the goal of creating apeaceful and prosperous planet’. The clowns had to come on any minute, surely?This had got to be the punch line. I mean, what else could it be? What, noclowns? My god, they were serious. Whatever next, Obama getting the Nobel PeacePrize? I like to keep myself to myself in terms of other researchers and just domy own thing, but these are points that need making because so many are led upthe garden path by elements within the alternative media who are little boys inshort trousers with no idea what they are dealing with but think they have. Iread in a New Age magazine in the 1990s that Bill Clinton was a ‘light worker’and Neale Donald Walsch suggests pretty much the same about Father George Bushin his best-selling book, Conversations with God. I don’t know who his ‘god’ is,but he ought to get out more. Walsch reports ‘god’ as saying:> There have been those leaders among you who have been insightful enough and> brave enough to propose the beginnings of such a new world order. Your George> Bush, whom history will judge to be a man of far greater wisdom, vision,> compassion, and courage than contemporary society was willing or able to> acknowledge, was such a leader. So was Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.Father George Bush is a heartless, soulless serial child abuser, torturer andkiller who cost the lives of millions around the word because of his militaryand economic policies. Gorbachev was a Rothschild-Rockefeller frontman installedto oversee the end of the Soviet Union so that those countries could start to beabsorbed into NATO and the European Union. He now heads a ‘foundation’ callingfor world government. Shakes head, moves on ... David Wilcock wrote after Obamawon his first election that he was not part of the ‘power elite’:> Obama’s Presidential victory represents a watershed moment in human history on> many levels ... Obama’s victory was the final achievement of the dream started> by Jimi Hendrix, who rejected materialism and vanity by sacrificing his guitar> ...> ... It certainly appears as if Obama’s victory is being hailed as the final> return of the same karma that the New World Order elites created by> assassinating Martin Luther King, the Kennedys and others ...> ... The people who are filled with hate and fear don’t want to look at the> facts I present. They scathingly rip at me for my intuitive guidance that> Obama is working for the good of humanity. They believe they are on the> cutting edge of conspiracy scholarship.Well, you’re certainly not, mate. I watched another Benjamin Fulford video fromMarch 2012 in which he interviewed Alexander Romanov and a gentleman in a bowlerhat called Chodoin Daikaku who talked about using martial artists to remove thecabal. Fulford said in 2011 that his claptrap coalition could ‘mobilize 100million fighters in all regions of the planet at short notice’. By the time ofthe video in 2012 that figure had risen to 200 million according to thegentleman in the bowler hat. That is one hell of a recruitment drive. Were theyoffering a free Parker pen? Romanov and Daikaku proceeded to devote much oftheir contributions to praising the Russian President and tyrant, VladimirPutin. They said that he was one of the leaders who had been sent at this timeof change and transformation (see Bill Clinton, Father Bush and Barack Obama).Yes, one of the leaders to lead us into the Orwellian nightmare, but that is nothow these two ‘liberators’ saw it. World peace and harmony ‘needs strength’,apparently, and the reason that Putin is a ‘strong and desirable leader’ isbecause he has studied judo and become a 5th degree black belt, or so Daikakutold us from under his bowler. By heck, there was some serious bollocks beingtalked here. Vladimir Putin is one of the very Rothschild gang that thesebewildered people claim to be challenging and so is the leadership in Chinawhere the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are heavily represented at the highestlevels. Putin and the Chinese dictators are in the process of playing their partin triggering a Third World War with the ‘West’ (controlled by the sameArchontic networks) which is planned to cause the death and nuclear destructionthat they want to lead to a new planetary order – theirs. Alexander Romanovclaims to represent the same (Gnostic Illuminati) group that he says was behindthe French, American and Russian Revolutions (the last of which killed theRomanovs??) when all of them were orchestrated and funded by the House ofRothschild. Are any of these people ever going to utter a single supportablefact? Fulford and his crowd said that they want to introduce a ‘meritocracy’which is defined as ‘a powerful class composed of people who have achievedposition on the basis of their merit rather than by birth or privilege’; and‘rule by persons chosen not because of birth or wealth, but for their superiortalents or intellect’. So who decides who has ‘superior talents or intellect’?Exactly. This is the same form of government being peddled by RothschildIlluminati frontman Zbigniew Brzezinski. The mass arrests nonsense and theWhite/Black/Green/Red/Sky-blue-bloody-pink Dragons are all a childish gamesimplistically broken down into the ‘good guys’ and the ‘bad guys’, or the ‘badguys’ and the ‘not-so-bad guys’ (mega crooks and killers with a heart of gold).Two primary rules of disinformation and perception programming: keep it simpleand tell the people what they want to hear. This is what this bunch of crap andso much more in the alternative media is all about. ‘Yeah, er, duh, I can followthat – these Illuminati who kill and suppress people are the baddies and theseGnostic Illuminati and their mates who kill and suppress people are the goodies.I got it.’ American writer Mark Twain rightly said: ‘It’s easier to fool peoplethan to convince them they have been fooled.’ Those driving the global ControlSystem today are the same bloodlines and secret society networks that ‘Drake’,Fulford and Wilcock say want to bring down the system. Take a deep breath,chaps, take a step back and look at it again before you get any deeper in thisland of make-believe. They can get so tied up and stitched up in the smoke andmirrors maze of ‘my intelligence sources’, ‘my inside contacts’ that massage ‘myego’ when most of these ‘impeccable sources’ are calculated disinformers tomisdirect attention and muddy the waters. Those with little real insight intothe game are child’s play to these two-faced, fork-tongued spooks. The spookskeep it simple, tell people what they want to hear, massage egos, and when one‘insider scoop’ doesn’t happen, or deadline after deadline passes withoutincident, they just promote the next ‘scoop’ and name another ‘deadline’. Thisis what has been happening for some time now and, much as I don’t seek tochallenge other researchers, there comes a moment when an alternative view needsto be aired when you see the misdirection. I have seen it all before withflavour-of-the-moment-and-then-gone operations like the ‘White Knights’ and‘White Hats’ and all the rest. The ‘White Knights’ were mostly claimed to be USmilitary officers who were planning to revolt against the Control System adecade and more ago. The ‘White Hats’ were promoted by people such as ET/UFOwriter Richard Boylan, another one from Naivety Anonymous in my experience and,of course, nothing came of them, either.When you study events and methods of perception manipulation throughout knownhuman history you see clear repeating patterns appearing in every era, cultureand generation. They are hidden behind different names and disguises but theyare the same recurring blueprint. One of the main ones is the saviour blueprintbecause ‘come and save me’ is written into human DNA. Another is to tell peoplewhat they want to hear and when you put the two together the mass manipulationpotential shoots off the scale. Promoting something that is hard to follow andtells people what they don’t want to hear is a near-impossible ‘sell’ and sothey don’t do that. They tell the target audience what they so wish to be true.This also taps into the saviour program that has been embedded in human DNA forthe specific purpose of making people look for an external saviour rather thantake action themselves by tapping into their own innate power. We see this withthe Messiah belief-system of Judeo-Christianity and other religions; we see itin dependence on governments to take action to protect us when they arecontrolled by the very force that is seeking human enslavement; we see it alsoin the blind faith in doctors, priests, gurus and gods of all kinds. This crapabout the White Dragon Society and the ducks and drakes comedy skimming thesurface of sanity are another expression of the come-and-save-me program. ‘Ihave no power, I am just little me, and my teeth chatter at the very thought ofexpressing myself – I need a saviour.’ ‘White Dragons?’ ‘White Knights?’ WhiteHats?’ Great White Brotherhood?’ Oh, yes, please. Anything white must be good.It’ll be all white on the knight. Employ the Archontic language of reversal andinversion and what do you get? These saviour blueprints have another great bonusfor the Archons. They buy time, or what we call time. The longer they canmaintain humanity in a state of non-action the longer they have to completetheir Orwellian lockdown designed to eventually block any effective action andwe are already getting close. We have seen this technique ever since the Stateof Israel was bombed into being in 1948. The endless talks, talks about talksand ‘road maps’ have been delaying tactics to buy time to complete the genocideof the Palestinian people. Whenever it seems that Israel will have to reach anagreement they find an excuse to stop the process with Mossad even staging afake ‘Arab’ terror attack against Israelis to which they can feign horror andsay the ‘peace process’ must be put on hold. The same delaying technique can beseen with the mass arrests scenario. We don’t have to do anything because theWhite Dragons, White Knights, White Hats or Great White Brotherhood are on thecase. But they’re not, and never were. Even if the White Dragon-GnosticIlluminati stuff was true we would only be exchanging one tyranny for another(actually the same tyranny).Words do not sufficeOne final point on the alternative media, within which so many genuine peopleoperate and give their lives to expose the many levels of the conspiracy for noother reason than they believe this to be the right thing to do. There areothers, however, masquerading as exposers of the ‘truth’ who set out to damagethe genuine through lies and disinformation and also in some cases because theyare uninformed egomaniacs. Louis Turi, an astrologer in the United States, triedhard to damage me and what I do after I suggested that the Moon, on which muchof his astrology is based, was not a natural body. He tried at one point toconnect my work to a youngster who went on a shooting spree and listed The DavidIcke Guide to the Global Conspiracy as his favourite book. Turi, a self-styledmodern-day ‘Nostradamus’, sent out a mass email headed ‘Fact! David Icke is anevil promoter’. Meanwhile, those I am exposing go on with their daily horrors,but that doesn’t matter so long as people like Turi get to vent their speen.There is a ‘conspiracy researcher’ called Melanie Vermaak (known as ‘Mel Ve’) ata site bravely called ‘Freedom Central’. Ms ‘Ve’ said that I earn £5 million ayear and that she ‘knew that’ when the very idea is moronic beyond words andeven more than double the lunatic claim of Time Warner and Jesse Ventura. Shealso said that I was basically misleading people by telling the public aboutZionists, but not the Roman Church connection when anyone can see (well, clearlynot anyone) that my books are full of the Vatican connection and there is a 90minute film on the Internet of me walking around Rome talking about the Vatican,Jesuits and other associated secret societies. All this failed to strike thelady’s bewildered ‘radar’ but then it’s not alone. She supported her claims bysaying on an Internet radio broadcast that I and two other researchers hadrecorded an interview in Rome. Oh, that clinches it then ... except that thisinterview took place in Switzerland. I have come across this mentality andmotivation among many other would-be ‘researchers’ in the field, and others,over the years who could not breach the walls of a paper bag if an understandingof the subject were the only method of escape. Ms Ve also came out with theclassic that if I wasn’t controlled by ‘them’ then I would already be dead. Sowhy isn’t she? Is there a more defeatist, give-your-power-away, attitudepossible than to say that the only proof of your genuineness is if ‘they’ killyou? Hey, we have got no chance of success, but think of all the gloriousmartyrs. We are back to the medieval ducking stool. If you don’t drown you are awitch and if you do drown you are innocent. As with people I have had in my ownlife, the red mist before their eyes is not the result of a passion to make adifference in the world in the face of all the horrors unfolding for so many. Itis to do what they think is best for ‘me, me, me’ and how to most effectivelyvent their jealousy and harm their target. We need maturity and integrity in theglobal situation that we face, but such people can deliver only the terribletwos. Apparently, after nearly 25 years and travelling to well over 50countries, I am not a serious researcher according to ‘Ve’ and I do not have theintelligence to do the job anyway. How could I, she says, when I left school at15 without taking a major exam? This mentality is challenging ‘the System’??There is a dedicated and genuine researcher in the UK, a former LieutenantCommander in the Royal Navy, Brian Gerrish, who selflessly works to expose themanipulations in Britain. See his website ukcolumn.org. No matter what he hasunselfishly achieved this ‘Mel Ve’ person attacked him with claims that wereludicrously, laughably and provably inaccurate and when Brian complained aboutthis and pointed out that given his line of work what she said was libellous hereceived an email from Ms Ve’s husband, Richard Vermaak, saying: ‘My suggestionto you Mr Gerrish, is that you make a nice quiet exit from the public eyebecause this is only going to get messier for you.’ This was absolutelyextraordinary with Brian having made such a considerable contribution to publicawareness and supported many parents who were faced with losing their childrento the state fascists. But the Vermaaks’ mentality and worse infests significantsections of the alternative media in among the fantastic people who genuinelywant to make a difference. Another bloke called Martin Timothy, who seemed to beconnected to a dockers’ organisation in Australia, posted a comment under one ofmy videos which said the following:> David Icke’s shows are a money laundering scam ... Ziomossad clone, rumor> monger, whence no one goes to the shows. Then the Zionists who stole 2.3> trillion from the Pentagon, and billions more from the Iraq War chest, who> finance his operation, say X thousands bought tickets, and bingo the money is> clean!What mentality does it take to base such nonsense on few people coming to myevents when the opposite is clearly the case and it would take only a fewminutes to establish that? What are the motivations of these characters and whaton earth goes on in their heads? One says that I am misleading people thatZionism is involved and not the Roman Church (it’s both for goodness sake) andthe other says I am an asset of the Zionists. I was sent the Martin Timothynonsense by someone and I usually smile and get on with my day, but given that Iwas planning to write an article on the subject I emailed the guy to ask for theall the evidence he had to support this claim which I would post unedited on mywebsite. What evidence did he produce? Zilch. The big zero. There is aresearcher in Canada called Alan Watt who has claimed on American radio that Iam an agent of British Intelligence. I contacted him when I first heard to askhim to send me all the evidence that he had to back up his claims and I wouldonce again post every word unedited on my website. The evidence he produced?Zilch. The big zero. Mr Watt has said that there is a British Intelligencetraining operation for people like me at ‘the Cotswolds in London’ when theCotswolds is nowhere near London, never mind ‘in’ it. The Cotswolds is a touristregion way out of London in the west of England, but again don’t let the factsspoil a good hatchet job. An ‘alternative’ website had my picture permanentlydisplayed with ‘British Intelligence’ underneath. I asked them for the evidenceand it turned out to be what Alan Watt said! You can take the conspiracy‘researcher’ out of the system, but you can’t take the system out of theconspiracy ‘researcher’. Well, you can, because it has happened with many, butnot with the mentality I am speaking about. Why do such people do this? Theytell such lies and they must know they are doing so when they can’t produce ashred of evidence to support what they say. Either that or their research, orlack of it, is laughable. What are they trying to achieve? To this mentality thegreater good is not the prime objective and in every walk of life you see thisfragmentation of focus into a game within a game. Infighting in politics is farmore important to most politicians than what is needed to serve the people. Inthe same way, infighting, feuding and competing with other researchers is farmore important to many in this field than actually what we are supposed to beworking for. Have they not looked around the world and their own country andseen what is happening? But their prejudices and jealousies are far too powerfuland consuming. I can understand those who have no idea what is going on andwhere the world is going who hurl their ridicule and abuse; but those who havesome idea and still respond by attacking and exploiting those who are trying todo something? Extraordinary. To know and do nothing is far worse than notknowing and doing nothing. To know and do nothing, and even attack and exploitthose who are doing something, is the very dregs. Surely, we should besupporting each other in the common cause of human freedom in the face of thefascist onslaught. But no; lies, tittletattle, trying to undermine others,profit from others and venting vindictiveness on others is far more powerful formany than putting the greater good before their own perceived (illusory)self-interest. I am all for exposing disinformers and nonsense, but do it withfacts not fact-less vindictiveness. It is way past the time that faceless,gutless people hiding behind anonymous log-in names evolved beyond puberty andstarted making a positive contribution to what we are dealing with instead ofdoing their best to undermine those who already are. The self-indulgence isbreathtaking and when the knock comes on their door they will be screaming fortheir mum.People need to take their power back and not give it away to a government,doctor, scientist, journalist or White Knight and certainly not to me because Idon’t want it, thanks. Many see a distinct difference and division between themainstream and alternative media, but it’s not like that. Yes, there arecolossal differences between the mainstream and parts of the alternative, butnot all of it. Too often they are doubles of each other and the alternativesector can be a vehicle for manipulation and disinformation every bit as much asthe mainstream. The alternative media is far from an Archon-free zone and whywould it be when the idea is to keep the public ignorant of what is really goingon? They are just going to leave the alternative media to get on with itunmolested and uninfiltrated? Sure they are. The lesson is to questioneverything, including all that I say. Check it out and see how it feels to you.Take anything as read without question and you are asking for trouble."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00328.jpg]The Hunger GamesHell happens when the evil of the world exceeds our belief that we can conquer.Leonardo da VinciOne of the most popular films of 2012 was The Hunger Games which portrayed apost-apocalyptic nation called Panem in which a super-rich, super-pampered,super-callous El-ite lived in high-tech luxury while the rest of the populationdaily battled to survive in abject poverty locked away behind prison fences inintensively-populated ‘people zones’. Panem comes from the Latin phrase panem etcircenses or ‘bread and circuses’ – a term derived from Rome and meaning to givethe people diversions and distractions to hide what is being done to them. Thisis not happening today is it?The film’s title referred to the annual Hunger Games when young people agedbetween 12 and 18, known as ‘tributes’, were selected in a lottery to representeach of the sectors, or districts, and fight to the death on a realitytelevision show. The last one standing was then rewarded with fame and wealth.The Games were established in the story as a punishment for a rebellion by thesectors against the heavily defended home of the El-ite called the ‘Capitol’.The film had a grotesquely wealthy and powerful few dictating the daily lives ofthe hungry and downtrodden masses; it had people imprisoned in sectors with eachsector specialising in a particular service to the El-ite; and it had theultimate divide and rule in which people from one oppressed sector sought tosurvive by brutally killing representatives from other equally oppressed sectorson the say-so of the oppressors of all oppressed sectors. The latter isprecisely what is happening today (and since the Archon hijack) when people inuniform from the masses of one country are sent to mass-murder people in uniformfrom the masses of another country on behalf of an El-ite that is oppressingboth masses and never sees a bullet fire in anger except at a grouse shoot. Thefilm was adapted from a book of the same name, one of a trilogy by Americanwriter Suzanne Collins. I don’t know what her motivations were, but the movieadaption that I saw, with its logo of a phoenix standing within a fiery ring,most certainly portrayed the world that the bloodlines are seeking to globallyimpose (Fig 628). The Totalitarian Tiptoes to just such a world are happeningall around us, although most people can’t see this because they don’t connectthe dots. People tend to live in their own ‘little world’ and focus on only afew subjects and interests. This gives them a distorted view of what ishappening because they are so busy concentrating on the strands that they cannotsee the tapestry. I am going to expose that tapestry in the next few chaptersand how the world of The Hunger Games is already well on the way to fruitionunless humanity has a fundamental reassessment of reality.[../Images/00314.jpg]Figure 628: The phoenix agenda.Agenda 21 – the End GameThe foundations, structure and ‘must haves’ of a Hunger Games society aredetailed in a plan being imposed through the United Nations called Agenda 21which encompasses two related themes of ‘sustainable development’ and‘biodiversity’ (Fig 649). Don’t be caught out by the apparent meaning of thewords. They are the work of the inverters and reversers after all. Sustainabledevelopment – as in don’t use more than can be replaced – sounds sensible enoughat first until you realise what this and biodiversity really mean in the contextof the conspiracy. Agenda 21 was established at the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, hosted byMaurice Strong, a Canadian oil and business billionaire and long-time frontmanfor the Rothschilds and Rockefellers (Fig 650). Strong has been a leader oftheir exploit-the-environment-to-scam-the-people programme which is now in fullflow and he said with typical forktongue mendacity that he is a capitalist whenit comes to his billionaire businesses, but collectivist when it comes to savingthe planet. Put this through the bullshit translator and out comes ... ‘I am abillionaire from the Capitol and I want the masses living in Hunger Gamespoverty justified by saving the planet’. Strong is a member of the Club of Rome,the environmental Hidden Hand in the Round Table network that includes theBilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations. Strongnow operates out of China where the Rothschilds and Rockefellers have enormousinterests and influence and he has made a fortune out of the so-called‘environmental’ policies that he has helped to promote. He said in support ofAgenda 21: ‘Isn’t the only hope for this planet that the industrialisedcivilization collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?’ This isa man who became mega-rich through the oil industry. He now lives in billionaireluxury in China where carbon-emitting industry is booming and he is a directorof the Chicago Climate Exchange (largest shareholder, Goldman Sachs), which is‘the world’s first and North America’s only legally-binding greenhouse-gasemission registry reduction-system for emission sources and offset projects inNorth America and Brazil’. The Exchange was established with funding from theJoyce Foundation where Barack Obama was once a director. Strong and Al Gore makemoney through the Carbon Exchange and other means from the lies they promoteabout climate change and the solutions they propose. Kate Johnston wrote on theGlobalresearch.ca website: ‘The same men that sold us the myth of man-madeglobal warming are the same men that sold us the “solution” of a Carbon Tax andEmissions Trading Scheme and now they’re profiting off their lucrativeinvestments which are based on lies.’ Strong fled to China in 2006 after beingaccused of corruption with respect to the UN oil for food program. MauriceStrong involved in corruption? Must be some mistake surely? See ... And TheTruth Shall Set You Free for the background to the deeply unpleasant Strong.Obama lost billions in taxpayers’ money by giving grants to ‘green’ energycompanies that either went nowhere or tits up. A scandal threatened and Obamaordered an ‘independent’ inquiry which cleared him of all allegations (he musthave been a student of Blair). Wall Street’s Herbert Allison was selected byObama to conduct a pathetic and well-paid ‘independent inquiry’ into Obama’sactions and, no, never, it can’t be, he cleared Obama of all blame for anythingand then donated $52,000 to the re-elect Obama campaign. Obama is definitely inthe same league of political corruption in which Blair is an Olympic championand no doubt he will have eclipsed him by now. Time and again you find thepeople pushing the climate change agenda are profiting from that agenda. BritishConservative MP Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change SelectCommittee, has received £140,000 a year from ‘green’ energy companies and whatis most shocking is that he doesn’t see the mind-blowing conflict of interest(or doesn’t want to admit it). This is a man who has said that it may benecessary to ‘bribe’ communities to accept the ugly, noisy, irrelevant windfarms and it was he who proposed a 2013 amendment to the Energy Bill socrippling in its binding carbonemission target that Professor Gordon Hughes ofEdinburgh University, one of Britain’s leading authorities on energy economics,called it ‘surreal’ and ‘a recipe for deindustrialisation’. Yes, but what have Ibeen talking about? The post-industrial, postdemocratic society. Can anyone giveme a word other than ‘corrupt’ for Yeo to be funded with more than twice hisMP’s salary by the ‘Green’ energy industry while chairing the Energy and ClimateChange Select Committee in Parliament which oversees the ‘Green’ energy industryand proposing a draconian amendment with great benefit for the ‘Green’ energyindustry? I think I hear silence. The only alternative to ‘corrupt’ that I canthink of is fucking corrupt. At the same time that Yeo was trying to force theBritish people to commit industrial hari-kari with all the benefits to hisfunders a report into the carbon efficiency of wind power concluded that many ofthese abominations unleash more carbon than they save because a high percentagein Britain are built or planned to be built on peat lands – one of the world’sbiggest absorbers of carbon from the atmosphere. Locating wind turbines with allthe access roads means a lot of peat is destroyed. Take me home mother, pleasetake me home. Then, as if we have not had enough crazy for one day, it wasannounced that Jonathan Cawley, a recent chairman of the wind farm industry’strade body in Wales, and Planning and Development Manager for wind farmdeveloper West Coast Energy, was to become director of planning for theSnowdonia National Park Authority in Wales which has been opposing wind farmsamid or near its stunning natural beauty. Come on mother, quick as you can.Climate change propaganda is a No-Problem-Reaction-Solution to justify Agenda 21and its stable-mate the Biodiversity Treaty. This is an internationallybindingdocument involving nearly 200 countries. The United States signed the treaty,but it was not ratified by the Senate after people like ecologist and ecosystemscientist Dr Michael Coffman exposed its true consequences and implications. Hesaid that he realised during the 1980s and 1990s that the plan was to use theexcuse of protecting the environment to confiscate half the land of the UnitedStates. Similar plans exist for every other country. America may not haveratified the Treaty, but it is being implemented by the day. Agenda 21 demandsthe central global control of all land; all private property; all water sourcesand distribution; all other resources which includes people in its definition;all energy supplies and distribution and all food production and distribution.Agenda 21 is called ‘the agenda for the 21st century’ and that refers to globalfascism/communism. This is a summary of what Agenda 21/SustainableDevelopment/Biodiversity is seeking to impose:[../Images/00058.jpg]Figure 649: Agenda 21 – blueprint for global fascist control.[../Images/00377.jpg]Figure 650: Maurice Strong and Al Gore, the no-soul mates.> • An end to national sovereignty> • State planning and management of all land resources, ecosystems, deserts,> forests, mountains, oceans and fresh water; agriculture; rural development;> biotechnology; and ensuring ‘equity’ (equal slavery)> • The State to ‘define the role’ of business and financial resources> • Abolition of private property (it’s not ‘sustainable’)> • ‘Restructuring’ the family unit> • Children raised by the State> • People told what their job will be> • Major restrictions on movement> • Creation of ‘human settlement zones’> • Mass resettlement as people are forced to vacate land where they currently> live> • Dumbing down education (achieved)> • Mass global depopulation in pursuit of all of the aboveThis horrific plan is being coordinated through the United Nations, the stalkinghorse for world dictatorship, via a non-governmental network once called theInternational Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), and now knownas Local Governments for Sustainability although still using the shortened nameICLEI. The United Nations is now opening ‘embassies’ around world called ‘UNHouses’ under the guise of raising awareness of UN activities, but not theactivities that people really need to know about. They have opened one in HunterSquare, Edinburgh, Scotland, for example. UN External Affairs and InternationalDevelopment Minister Humza Yousaf said: ‘The establishment of a UN House inEdinburgh is recognition of Scotland’s long and proud history as a nation withan international approach and a concern to play its part in tackling globalpoverty, inequality and injustice.’ Yeah, yeah, yawn. It’s a preparation for aworld government dictatorship under Agenda 21. Local Governments forSustainability (ICLEI) and other organisations are integrating the plan intoevery village, town, city and region and it is already becoming widespreadacross the world. In the United States this includes the regional Councils ofGovernments also known as regional councils, regional commissions, regionalplanning commissions, planning district commissions and development districts.The organisational infrastructure of Agenda 21 is already fantastic and involvesgovernment agencies, nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), think-tanks, trusts,foundations, ‘training’ (mind control) operations and ‘initiatives’ which havebeen building the infrastructure for what they call ‘the post-industrial,post-democratic’ society while the public go about their daily businessoblivious of the prison being built all around them by the hour. KonradOtto-Zimmermann (Rothschild Zionist) is the secretary general of ICLEI which issupported by a whole array of Archontic fronts. Harvey Ruvin, a vice-chairman ofICLEI, was asked how Agenda 21 would affect liberties with regard to the USConstitution and Bill of Rights, private property and freedom of speech. Hereplied: ‘Individual rights must take a back-seat to the collective.’ Thearrogance of these people is breathtaking. The extraordinary network supportingICLEI and Agenda 21 includes the Rockefeller-sponsored America 2050; UnitedCities and Local Governments (UCLG); Metropolis; World Economic Forum; UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP); United Nations Human Settlements Programme(UN-Habitat); United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; UnitedNations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction; World Bank; ClintonClimate Initiative; Climate Group (Tony Blair); World Conservation Union (IUCN);Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership; Global Footprint Network;International Centre for Sustainable Cities; Earthquakes and MegacitiesInitiative and the Stakeholder Forum. These and so many others are working tothe same end – Agenda 21 and total human enslavement worldwide, although most ofthose involved will have no idea that they are building a global prison forthemselves and their families. Another of these front organisations is the WorldBusiness Council for Sustainable Development which includes the hideouslyanti-people Monsanto and other lovers of humanity and the environment such asGeneral Motors, DuPont, 3M, Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Sony, BP and Royal Dutch Shell.Destroying food-growing land, dowsing the countryside with toxins and replacingproper food with deadly and soil-destroying genetically-modified organisms isMonsanto’s contribution to ‘sustainability’. Agenda 21 is already operating inmore than 600 towns, cities and counties in the United States and expanding bythe day. I live on the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England which isonly 23 miles by 13 and yet it is signed up to the global Agenda 21 as early as2000. The local council which imposed this outrage talks about ‘Island voicesspeaking out for the future’ when the bloody opposite is true. They know that ifpeople saw this as a global plan there would be far more resistance and thenature of the entire global conspiracy would morph into clarity. To overcomethis they make out that each one is a ‘local initiative’ by local people when itis all globally coordinated (Fig 651). The Isle of Wight document says:> In common with all other local authorities in the UK the Isle of Wight Council> has developed an Agenda 21 Strategy for the Island. The purpose of an Agenda> 21 Strategy is to bring social, environmental and economic well-being to us> all at the same time as ensuring that we leave the world at least as good a> place as we found it. (Known as sustainable development).> The Agenda 21 Strategy has been developed in close partnership with the Isle> of Wight Health Authority [God help us], the Isle of Wight Partnership and> most importantly, with the Island’s communities. The Strategy represents an> honest and wholehearted attempt to involve as many local people as possible in> having their say about how our Island develops into the future. Through this> inclusive process a Strategy has been developed which as far as possible> reflects the views of the community.As examples of Archontic inversion go that takes some beating. This is the typeof disingenuous flannel being employed throughout the world to hide the factthat the fine detail of our lives is being hijacked by the global Archonticnetwork which this book is exposing. Some people behind the island contributionto Agenda 21 will know this while most are just ignorant of the world and/or cansee that there could be some money in it. Never mind the global prison camp thattheir children and grandchildren will have to live in because of them. How badmust it be given that bloodline arse-licker Tony Blair told the UN GeneralAssembly Special session on the Environment in 1997: ‘I want all localauthorities in the UK to adopt Local Agenda 21 Strategies by the year 2000.’Shit, it must be a nightmare, then; and it is. A member of the Agenda 21committees in Santa Cruz, California, in the mid-1990s said that the proposalsthat he heard were so crazy that he laughed at them because they could neverhappen. These included that ‘Mother Earth’s surface was not to be scratched’;humans should be concentrated in settlement zones; education should focus on theenvironment as a central organising principle and all aspects of life covered byAgenda 21, but all of these crazy plans are now being introduced. It sayseverything about Agenda 21 that when I quote from the document circulated by thetiny Isle of Wight I am quoting in essence from every other one throughout theworld. It’s all happy, feely, smiling faces and how we care, when the truth isthat Agenda 21 is a vicious, brutal, heartless strategy to impose a globalOrwellian state. This is the ‘vision for the Island of the Members and Officers’under Agenda 21: ‘A happy, contented and prosperous Island, where each member ofthe community enjoys the highest quality of life and where we work together toensure that the Island’s natural beauty and cultural heritage is passedundiminished to future generations.’ The same crap is being parroted by similarpeople on all continents and it goes on:[../Images/00252.jpg]Figure 651: Agenda 21 – the apparently local hiding the global coordination.> The Island’s Agenda 21 Strategy is a unique piece of work born out of the care> and commitment that Island people have for their home [no it’s not]. It> reflects the energy and vision that fired the original Agenda 21 at the Earth> Summit in 1992, where ordinary people, by joining together, were able to> influence the decision-makers and make their voice heard.No it doesn’t. It reflects the energy and vision of a global cabal thatorganised the Earth Summit of 1992 to manipulate naïve environmentalists and NewAgers into believing that something headed by a billionaire oil tycoon likeRothschild-Rockefeller frontman Maurice Strong cares about the planet and whathe would see as its great unwashed. The Isle of Wight document says that ‘thegreatest challenge now is to connect Local Agenda 21 to the “mainstream”decision processes of local authorities and other corporate bodies so that LocalAgenda 21 really does change the way we live.’ This sentence captures everythingin many ways. The challenge is to connect the Isle of Wight into the globalnetwork of local authorities and corporate bodies that will allow every localcommunity to be controlled by a global administration, a world government. Herewe get closer to the point:> The Island has a unitary local authority, which is responsible for the overall> governance of the Island. This is fortunate as local government has a special> significance for Agenda 21. At the Earth Summit in 1992 it was made very clear> that up to two thirds of Agenda 21 depends upon local government for its> successful implementation.> World leaders acknowledged that only by all of the world’s communities acting> locally, can we ever succeed in bringing about sustainable development. And> that only by empowering those communities through and by genuine local> participative democracy, can we together achieve the changes that are so> urgently needed.A few things here: Firstly, forget about the genuine local participativedemocracy. When I found out that the Isle of Wight had sign up to Agenda 21after ‘local debate and choice’, I continually asked local people I came acrossif they had ever heard of Agenda 21. Month after month I asked the public,lawyers, community workers, anyone I met. Not once did anyone say ‘yes’. This iswhat is happening all over the world. Agenda 21 manipulators either create orhijack some local organisation or other, many of them in locations with bigpopulations, and they have their (controlled) leadership to agree the Agenda 21blueprint for their community together with any uninformed, unwitting idiots whocan be sold a human nightmare as saving the planet. This allows them to claimthat decisions were made after ‘public participation’ when that would have beenthe last thing they wanted, and 99 percent of the ‘community’ has never heard ofAgenda 21 let alone had their say on it. They want no democracy which is whythese people talk privately, sometimes even publicly, about the post-democratic,postindustrial society. The reason ‘it was made very clear that up to two thirdsof Agenda 21 depends upon local government for its successful implementation’ isbecause they want to control every man, woman and child on the planet – everyoneand everywhere and every resource, water source and piece of land. To do thisthey need a global structure of fascist control that goes right down into everylocal community with the jackboots at local level enforcing the will of theglobal centre. This is why there is so much emphasis on local authorities andtown and city authorities in Agenda 21. I exposed earlier and in other books the‘training organisation’ called Common Purpose (common purpose, common consensus,everyone the same) which has been paid very large amounts of money bygovernments and local authorities, police forces and other institutions of stateto ‘train the leaders’ of the post-democratic, post-industrial society. CommonPurpose was heavily represented in the Leveson ‘inquiry’ leading to new medialaws in Britain. It is not a training programme; it is a programming programmeand turns out unquestioning zombie administrators who serve the god of Agenda 21and the associated European Union (see Human Race Get Off Your Knees). The themeof ‘common’ also applies to the ever greater standardisation of laws andregulations and constant reference to ‘international law’. This is the unfoldingglobal dictatorship of Agenda 21. What do you need to be a global dictator? Lawsthat everyone on the planet must obey – international law and thestandardisation of global regulation.No, this is not a joke – if onlyYou can see why I connect all of this to The Hunger Games when you look at theofficial Biodiversity wish-for map of the United States in Figure 652. Thedarkest areas – red in the original – are designated for no human use and mostof the rest of America is confiscated for little and highly-regulated use. Themass of the population would be concentrated in high-rise, densely-packed ‘humansettlement zones’ and denied access to something like 80 percent of present dayAmerica. It is without question the world of The Hunger Games with aglobally-enforced top-down hierarchy that has a world government using its worldarmy and police force to impose its will at regional and local levels (sectors).The Rockefeller-funded America 2050 has produced a map of the new United Statesdivided into eleven ‘megaregions’ and includes parts of Canada (Fig 653).Seattle, Portland and Vancouver, British Columbia, become the megaregion knownas ‘Cascadia’ and this regional system comes under the collective name of‘megalopolis’ which is Greek for large city or great city. America, Canada andMexico are due to merge to form the North American Union in line with theEuropean Union blueprint. I mentioned earlier that the European Union is plannedto be broken up into regions and the same structure is in development all overthe world. The map of the new Europe has regions from different countries linkedup with regions in other countries to end any vestige of national sovereignty oreven national existence (Fig 654). This is a global plan with its fierce centralcontrol hidden behind its lower elements such as the European Union and localgovernment. The EU bureaucrats published a document in early 2013 called ‘ADecent Life For All [inversion]: Ending poverty [inversion] and giving the worlda sustainable future [inversion]’ which proposed to pursue all the goals andambitions of Agenda 21 including global governance. What is planned wouldclearly require a fantastic reduction of the global population and this isindeed what Agenda 21/Sustainable Development/Biodiversity demand. They want thecurrent population of more than seven billion at the time of writing to bereduced to a billion or half a billion and Nick Rockefeller told film producerAaron Russo that they were going to reduce the human population by at leasthalf. These shocking figures of half a billion to a billion can be found intheir own documents and ‘written in stone’ on ‘America’s Stonehenge’. These arethe mysterious Georgia Guidestones in Elbert County which were commissioned in1979 by someone hiding behind the pseudonym R C Christian which is thought tosymbolise Christian Rosenkreuz, the 14th century founder of the RosicrucianOrder, another strand in the Archontic web (Fig 655). The ‘Guidestones’ arealigned with the Sun and Moon and list ten ‘guides’ or principles for a newworld society in the languages of English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew,Arabic, Chinese and Russian, with shorter messages in Babylonian, ClassicalGreek, Sanskrit and Egyptian hieroglyphics. One ‘guide’ calls for the globalpopulation to be maintained at ‘under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance withnature’ (Fig 656). Yoko Ono, the former wife of John Lennon, called the stones‘a stirring call to rational thinking’. I think that statement is more likely tomake John Lennon stir. This is the same Yoko Ono who refused permission forLennon’s songs Give Peace a Chance and Power to the People to be played at myWembley event in 2012 which represented everything that Lennon publicly stoodfor in his later life. Go figure. You can be sure that these stones and what iswritten on them in stone will be located at a point in the Earth’s energy gridwhich is highly effective in sending that information electromagnetically intothe global field to influence human perception. The stone symbolism comes fromSaturn’s relationship with what we perceive as dense matter and itsauthoritarian immovability captured in phrases like ‘written in stone’, ‘set instone’ and with the symbolic stone tablets on which Moses is said to haverecorded ‘God’s law’ (Saturn’s law). There is significance to the Archonbloodlines of literally writing something ‘in stone’ and this is to do withencoding information and a desired outcome in extreme energetic density whichmakes the information patterns or programs harder to break.[../Images/00219.jpg]Figure 652: The demand in Agenda 21 for a massive cull of the population can beunderstood when you see how much of America is designated for no human activity.[../Images/00052.jpg]Figure 653: The Rockefeller-funded America 2050 map of America and Canadadivided into megaregions.[../Images/00146.jpg]Figure 654: The European Union has the same regional structure in its sights.[../Images/00045.jpg]Figure 655: The Georgia Guidestones.[../Images/00333.jpg]Figure 656: Working in support of the Guidestone declarations.Let’s hear it for Bill ...A massive cull of the human population is a constant theme. A draft copy of theUnited Nations’ Global Biodiversity Assessment demands that the world populationbe reduced to a billion and Archontic frontmen like Microsoft billionaire BillGates and CNN founder Ted Turner have been very vocal in their support for justsuch a cull. Turner gave more than a billion dollars to the United Nations forpopulation reduction and said the ideal number would be between 200 and 300million – a reduction of 95 percent. This comes from a man who has five childrenand through his business holdings owns 15 ranches in Kansas, Montana, Nebraska,New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota and, by acreage, he is one of the biggestlandowners in North America and owns the biggest continuous tract of land in theUnited States. I’ll put him and his family down for the Capitol then. They don’tsound like sector people to me. Bill Gates is such a blatant conduit for Agenda21 it is almost laughable. He presses the case for the manufactured lie andidiotic nonsense of human-caused ‘global warming’; his Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation has given billions to population control in league with their friend,multi- billionaire financier Warren Buffett who controls the Foundation withGates; he funds Agenda 21 education policies; the Foundation is the biggestprivate funder of vaccination programmes in the ‘Third World’ which are nothingmore than immune-system destroyers aimed at population reduction – just as theyare in the rest of the world (Fig 657); and the Gates Foundation funds theexpansion of healthdestroying genetically-modified crops in Africa andelsewhere. Gates is also funding a stream of programmes to deliver vaccines ondemand (including by unmanned drones!) and to ‘counter misinformation’ (truth)about the dangers of vaccines. Gates has also made clear his support for thesocalled ‘Death Panels’ that would decide if elderly people should continue tobe treated if it is deemed too expensive (never a problem for him). The more Iknow about the Gates’ and their Foundation the more disgusting I find them. Bonothinks they’re great and that ticks the final box for me. When Bono is on yourside it is time for a major rethink of where you are going and what you aredoing from what I can see. Gates admitted that his father William H Gates Sr.used to be the head of Planned Parenthood which emerged from the Americaneugenics movement. He further agreed that his family have a long record ofinvolvement with population control issues and had supported the beliefs of thearch eugenicist Thomas Malthus. Gates said he now holds a different view but youcan’t see that in his actions which can at best be described as Malthus-lite.Silvia Ribeiro wrote of the Gates’ ‘philanthropy’ in Mexico’s La Jornada:[../Images/00242.jpg]Figure 657: Gates ‘wants to help the poor and needy’.> ... their ‘donations’ finance projects as destructive as geoengineering or> replacement of natural community medicines for high-tech patented medicines in> the poorest areas of the world ... Gates is also engaged in trying to destroy> rural farming worldwide, mainly through the ‘Alliance for a Green Revolution> in Africa’ (AGRA). It works as a Trojan horse to deprive poor African farmers> of their traditional seeds, replacing them with the seeds of their companies> first, finally by [GMO].In fact, Bill Gates is such an asset of the cabal that he was given a knighthoodby the Queen for services to private enterprise and efforts to reduce povertyaround the world. Gates became a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order ofthe British Empire. They love their titles and rituals these people. Gatesjoined a list of despicable overseas recipients of royal ‘honours’ that includesFather George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, FBI despot J Edgar Hoover,Alan Greenspan whose policies crashed the American economy in 2008, 9/11 Mayorof New York Rudolph Giuliani, and mass military killers Colin Powell, WesleyClark and Norman Schwarzkopf. Kill vast numbers of people for the cabal or orderassassinations of problem-people like Martin Luther King and a knighthood isyours. Or fund the agenda like Gates. He goes on and on about the dangers of‘global warming’ while Microsoft (chairman and biggest individual shareholder B.Gates) was exposed for deliberately wasting ‘millions of watts of electricity’to avoid a fine for overestimating their power use in 2011 and so causing powerto be set aside for them that could have been used by others. Rather than paythe fine Microsoft proceeded to burn off the unused electricity to delete theoverestimation. It is the same with global warming high priest Al Gore who has acarbon footprint the size of Godzilla. The Gates are obsessed with populationcontrol and this includes funding the development of ultrasound technology tostop human sperm producing offspring. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the‘largest transparently operated private foundation in the world’, is reported tohave been inspired by the work of two Rothschild front men, Andrew Carnegie andJohn D Rockefeller, and ‘the generosity and extensive philanthropy of DavidRockefeller’. Well, how appalling must it be then? David Rockefeller has beenone of the most active Archon bloodline agents of the last more than 70 yearsand has probably never given a penny to anything that did not in some wayadvance the global agenda (Fig 658). You only have to follow the fundingcriteria and choices of the Gates Foundation to see that it is a mirror of theRockefeller Foundation and the two have appropriately been involved in joint‘ventures’. American Comedy Channel host Stephen Colbert interviewed MelindaGates on his show, The Colbert Report. He said: ‘... now you’ve got a newcharitable hobby horse you’re on, and it’s not necessarily saving people’slives, so much as it’s stopping people’s lives from existing.’ Yes, but it ismore than that when the population control movement and the Archontic familiesbehind it are taken in their entirety. It is also about reducing the populationby killing off those already here. This is being done instantly or cumulativelythrough war, famine, disease, radiation, chemicals in food and drink,contaminating the water supply, outright denial of healthcare or cut backs inits availability and by making ‘healthcare’ anything but ‘healthcare’ byallowing the Archontic pharmaceutical cartel or Big Pharma to run the entireshow in pursuit of profit and the depopulation agenda. A hidden and systematicmutation of the human species is also happening in ways that I will bedescribing and this has fantastic implications for lifespan. The culling ofthose considered genetically inferior is not new either, as we have seen withthe Archon families of Britain and North America providing funding and researchfor the ‘race-purity’ abomination of the Nazis, as I explained earlier. You cansee against this background the real reason for Big Pharma working to develop asix-in-one vaccine for polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B,and Haemophilus influenzae type B to be given in a single dose to the world’spoorest and weakest people. The then US Secretary of State Hillary Clintonannounced in 2012 that a new programme called the Global Health Initiative wouldbe ‘at the centre’ of American foreign policy. This was sold as a humanitarianinitiative, like all people-culling operations, and Clinton said that it wouldwork to reduce maternal and child mortality, prevent millions of unintendedpregnancies, and avert millions of new HIV infections. Put this through theOrwellian Translation Unit and you get ‘eugenics programme’. Clinton alsoannounced at the same time big increases in funding for the United NationsPopulation Fund (UNFPA) which has bankrolled the forced abortion of theone-child policy in China and promotes the eugenics wish list including forcedsterilisation. When the bloodlines and their agents say that they are committedto helping people it means they are committed to culling them.[../Images/00349.jpg]Figure 658: David Rockefeller – Gate’s role model. I can think of better.[../Images/00431.jpg]Figure 659: Margaret Sanger, population culler.Planned eugenicsOne of the centre-stage organisations in the ‘population control’ (peopleculling) movement is the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, widely knownas Planned Parenthood, which is the United States branch of the InternationalPlanned Parenthood Federation. Like most of these birth-control agencies theorigins begin in the eugenics movement so beloved (and funded) by theRockefellers, Harrimans, Bushes and the British bloodline El-lite and theirgofers like Winston Churchill. Planned Parenthood was established by MargaretSanger, lover of H G Wells, the writer and Fabian Society member who was a majorpromoter of eugenics. These fanatics were inspired by the work and thoroughlydiscredited views of Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) who believed that famine anddisease were a God-given check on population growth and so should not beeliminated. This was the chap that Charles Darwin and his circle called ‘amaster of logic’. Margaret Sanger was funded by the Nazi race-purity supportingRockefeller family from 1923 to promote her eugenics (Nazi) philosophy in theUnited States (Fig 659). Soon state administrations, schools and churches werepromoting eugenics and by 1927 half the states of America had introduced theforced sterilisation of the ‘lower stock’ with the support of the Supreme Court.It was fascism once again while waving the flag of a free country. Sangerestablished the American Birth Control League which became Planned Parenthood.Lest there be any doubt that we are talking Nazi eugenics, this is what Sangerwrote in a letter to an associate. She said that black leaders must be recruitedto promote sterilisation programmes for black people:> We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service> backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational> approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don’t want the word to> go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is> the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their> more rebellious members.It was the American wing of the Nazi race-purity movement and how apt that theAmerican Journal of Eugenics was formerly known as ‘Lucifer the Light Bearer’.He gets everywhere, this fellah. Here are some other quotes from this delightfullady on the Rockefeller payroll, Margaret Sanger:> No woman shall have the legal right to bear a child ... without a permit for> parenthood; The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant> members is to kill it; Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race;> Eugenic sterilization is an urgent need ... We must prevent multiplication of> this bad stock.The eugenics movement had to change its public face after Hitler’s version cameto light, but it was the same people with the same motives. Sanger’s AmericanBirth Control League changed its name to Planned Parenthood, and EugenicsQuarterly became Social Biology. This sounded better – but meant the same. ThePopulation Council was launched in 1952 by John D Rockefeller III with fundingfrom the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and another example of how eugenics waspromoted in the post-Hitler world as ‘population control’. The first presidentof the Population Council was Frederick Osborn, a leader of the AmericanEugenics Society, who wrote in 1968: ‘Eugenic goals are most likely to beachieved under another name than eugenics.’ The eugenicist Julian Huxley was thefirst Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific andCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the brother of author and Fabian AldousHuxley, who described in Brave New World how children would eventually beproduced technologically in ‘state hatcheries’ and brought up (programmed) bythe state. The eugenicist Julian Huxley was knighted by the Queen in 1958, nodoubt for services to people culling and deleting the genetic riff-raff. Huxleywas a co-founder of the eugenics front, the World Wildlife Fund (now theWorldwide Fund for Nature) with support from Godfrey Anderson Rockefeller Sr.Eugenicists Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and Prince Philip were alsoprominently involved. Rockefeller attended the ‘Skull and Bones’ Yale Universityat the same time as his friend, Father George Bush. Julian Huxley described howa new approach was needed to promote eugenics after the Hitler experience:> Even though ... any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically> and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that> the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public> mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable> may at least become thinkable.Well, it was always thinkable. The question was how do we sell it and how do weget such a powerful grip over the population that we can just impose it anyway?We are looking at the same plan all along under different approaches to PR. TheWest and especially the United States have spent trillions in total on enforcingpopulation programmes in the poorest countries in the world. Coercion comes inthe form of offering financial aid to governments only if population reductionprogrammes are implemented and there’s no money if they refuse. These‘programmes’ include secretly serialising women when they are in hospital forother conditions. A medical fact-finding mission in 1975 estimated that a thirdof women of child-bearing age had been sterilised through US Government‘programmes’ via USAID (a CIA front) and other agencies. Israel has been exposedfor secretly sterilising Ethiopian Jewish women and that is what you wouldexpect from a regime so obsessed with chosen races. Population policies are alsocentral to other organisations in the Archon web, including the World Bank. Anarticle by Jurriaan Maessen at ExplosiveReports.Com said:> According to two subsequent documents put out by the World Bank, its> guidelines dictate that in order to qualify for World Bank lending, sovereign> nations must implement population reduction objectives as outlined by the> World Bank and UN Population Fund. If they refuse, lending will be withdrawn.> Already pre-tested and implemented in Yemen and Niger, these guidelines are> destined for global implementation within the next decade, says the World> Bank.Domestic populations are also being targeted. Native American physicianConstance Redbird Uri estimated that up to a quarter of Indian women ofchildbearing age had been sterilised by 1977 without informed consent. AngelaFranks said in her 2005 book Margaret Sanger’s Eugenic Legacy that a fourth ofNative American women admitted to one Oklahoma hospital for other conditionsleft sterilised and that all the pure-blood women of the Kaw tribe in the stateof Oklahoma were sterilized in the 1970s. This is part of the geneticmanipulation of the human species that involves wiping out some bloodlinesaltogether. A similar story can be told among black communities and asignificant part of this is to continue with the genetic (information/awareness)suppression of the human race. There was compulsory sterilisation in someAmerican states even after the war and the Nazi experience and it was engineeredand funded by the usual suspects. I tell the story at length in ... And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. There was a ‘State Eugenics Board’ in North Carolinawhich had the authority to order compulsory sterilisation of adults andchildren. Among the sickest of minds involved were Dr Claude Nash Herndon, whohad the title Assistant Director of Eugenics, and Dr Clarence Gamble, an heir tothe Proctor and Gamble fortune. Herndon said:> ... IQ tests were later run on all the children in the Winston-Salem school> system. Only the ones who scored really low [were targeted for sterilisation],> the real bottom of the barrel, like below 70. Did we do sterilisations on> young children? Yes. This was a relatively minor operation ... it was usually> not [done] until the child was eight or ten years old. For the boys we would> just make an incision and tie the tube ... we more often performed the> operation on girls than boys. Of course, you have to cut open the abdomen, but> again, it is relatively minor.What they cannot see in their genetic and narcissistic arrogance is that ifsterilisations were to be performed on those considered the most stupid thenthey should have been the first in line. This was going on in the ‘Land ofFreedom’ after the Second World War and the aim of Agenda 21 is to makecompulsory sterilisation the norm worldwide. We already have the Agenda 21‘health’ policy called Obamacare introducing free sterilisations on demand forall women with ‘reproductive capacity’ and this includes teenage girls. The lawsays that women must have access without having to pay ‘a copayment,co-insurance or a deductible’ for all ‘approved contraceptive methods,sterilization procedures, and patient education and counselling for all womenwith reproductive capacity’. This is another Totalitarian Tiptoe to making itcompulsory. I am not saying that people should not be given a choice about whatto do with their own bodies, but that’s not the point here. It is not aboutchoice, but moving step-by-step to a point when there is no choice. The ultimategoal of Agenda 21 is to have a global China, a society that was closed andisolated for decades to allow the planned global society to be honed, developedand tested for efficiency. One primary element of this is the onechild (or none)population policy. Babies born in China in breach of the one-child rule aredubbed ‘black children’ with no right to food, health care or education. Theyare often killed, if they are female, to stop them producing children later inlife, and otherwise they are left in ‘dying rooms’ where they are systematicallymurdered through neglect and starvation (Fig 660). This is the cold and callousworld of the Archons and their hybrid bloodlines and agents who have no capacityfor empathy. China is not in the least alone in this genocide. John P Holdren,the man that Obama appointed to head the White House Office of Science andTechnology, co-wrote the 1977 book called Ecoscience in which he proposed tomass-sterilise the population by medicating food and the water supply (spermcounts have dropped by a third since 1989 and by half in 50 years). He calls fora policy of forced abortion, government seizure of children born out of wedlockand mandatory bodily implants to stop pregnancy. Only two children would beofficially allowed for each family and any more than that would disqualify theparents from public housing and the child from the right for a free-at-sourcepublic education. These are real nice people and so are those like Obama whoappoint them. In Holdren’s fevered mind a ‘planetary regime’ should dictate thedetail of everyone’s life in a ‘global commons’ (Agenda 21). Robert Zubrin wrotean outstanding summary on the New Atlantis website about what is going onthroughout the world. It was headlined ‘The Population Control Holocaust’ and ifyou put those words and his name into a search engine you will find the fullversion. Zubrin wrote:[../Images/00200.jpg]Figure 660: A Chinese ‘dying room’ for babies. Welcome to Agenda 21.> ... the programs are cruel, callous, and abusive of human dignity and human> rights.

It is not a coincidence that sperm counts have plummeted by half worldwideover the last 50 years and continue to fall. The European Science Foundationwarned in 2012 that at least one in five men aged 18 to 25 is what they call‘subfertile’. The number of couples in Britain seeking medical help withconception has increased by 55 percent in five years. Scientists have blamedenvironmental pollution with ‘gender-bending’ chemicals which disrupt thehormone system. It’s all part of the plan.Day-ja vuThe theme of Planned Parenthood brings me to one Dr Richard Day (RothschildZionist), a national medical director of Planned Parenthood and professor ofpediatrics at Mount Sinai Medical School in New York. He was a Rockefellerinsider and privy to the projected Archontic plan for human society. Dayaddressed around 80 doctors at the Pittsburgh Pediatric Society on March 20th,1969 and for whatever reason spilled the beans on what was to come. He wasn’tdoing this to expose the plan for the public good. It was more that he seemed tothink that by then so many elements were in place that it didn’t matter if a fewdoctors knew. What were they going to do about it, anyway? Day asked them toturn off recording equipment and not to take notes so this small gathering wasas far as it went; but one member of the audience, Lawrence Dunegan, aPittsburgh paediatrician, did take notes and before he died in 2004 he recordeda series of taped interviews to detail what Day had said all those decadesbefore. Dunegan said that Day told the gathering about the plan for populationcontrol (culling), as you would expect from a man in his position with PlannedParenthood. Day revealed the plan to cull and control the population throughmedicine, food, new laboratory-made diseases and the suppression of the cure forcancer. As I said earlier, he told the meeting: ‘We can cure almost every cancerright now. Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute [now theRockefeller University] if it’s ever decided that it should be released.’ Thisis one reason why so many of these bloodlines live to such an advanced age. Theyget the treatment they deny to the rest of the population. I know people who aresuccessfully treating even late-stage cancer and it is not the ‘Big C’, but the‘little c’ when you know what you are doing. Day said that letting people die ofcancer would reduce population growth: ‘You may as well die of cancer assomething else.’ This guy had to be an Archon hybrid with such a total lack ofempathy with those who needlessly suffer or watch loved ones die in horriblecircumstances. There was so much more that Day said in 1969 that has eitherhappened or is happening today. He said that the world would be divided intodifferent regions which would each be assigned a different role to serve aunified global system. Well, stop there for second. This is precisely what wasportrayed in The Hunger Games with the twelve fenced-off sectors assigneddifferent roles to serve the El-lite in the Capitol and in the plan right fromthe start for the European Union. Day said that the United States had beenassigned agriculture, high-tech, communications and education, but its heavyindustry would be ‘transported out’ (it has been – to China, the Far East ingeneral and other regions with access to slave labour). The independence,self-sufficiency and economic pre-eminence of the United States would be endedto make way for a new global structure in which every region of the world wouldbe interdependent on all the others and so have no control over its own destiny(happening). Growing food would be banned by saying it wasn’t safe and the stateand corporations would control all food production (happening). The supply anddistribution of food would be monitored so that no-one could give food to a‘fugitive of the system’ (in the pipeline). Day said that people who don’t wantto go along with the new world system would be ‘disposed of humanely’. Therewould be no ‘martyrs’ and people will just disappear (happening, see the NDAAact in the US that can make people ‘just disappear’). Children and young peoplewould spend longer at school, but learn nothing (happening). This was a goal ofthe Rothschild Zionist Frankfurt School of social engineering that has been theforce behind political correctness and so much else. It is also obvious thatwhat passes for education has been deliberately dumbed-down around the world asI have described. Day said that family life would be made to ‘diminish inimportance’ (something else on the wish list of the Frankfurt School) and we seethis being done through a wide spectrum of attacks on the family. Fewpoliticians do this more than those who say that they stand for family life andwant to restore ‘family values’ (inversion). Day said that there would berestrictions on travel and no private home-ownership (both demanded by Agenda21/Biodiversity). Violence, pornography and obscenity in the media and movieswould be increased to desensitise people to violence and porn (long beenhappening). Day said that the idea was to make them feel that life is short,precarious and brutish (see The Hunger Games and the current life-experience ofso many). He said that music would ‘get worse’ and be used for programmingperception (happening). This is why so much music along with stage shows andmusic videos are full of Satanic (Saturnic) symbolism. Day told the doctors thatsociety would be fundamentally controlled with people electronically tagged (themicrochip is now being introduced via the Totalitarian Tiptoe). Communitieswould be destroyed by unemployment and mass immigration (another outcome listedby the Frankfurt School and happening). The weather would be modified and usedas a weapon of war to create drought or famine (this is clearly happening andbeing blamed on human-caused climate change). Day was involved in weathermodification during World War II. He said ‘people will have to get used to theidea of change (see Barack Obama), so used to change that they’ll be expectingchange. Nothing will be permanent’ (long been happening). He was referring tothe ‘shock-testing’ techniques and others described in Silent Weapons for QuietWars in which you keep people in a constant state of change and upheaval. Thisis what Day predicted in 1969, as posted at: www.overlordsofchaos.com[http://www.overlordsofchaos.com]:> Population control (happening); permission to have babies (in the pipeline);> redirecting the purpose of sex – sex without reproduction and reproduction> without sex (happening); contraception universally available to all> (happened); sex education and ‘carnalising’ of youth as a tool of world> government (happening); tax-funded abortion as population control (happening);> encouraging anything goes homosexuality (happening); technology used for> reproduction without sex (happening); families to diminish in importance> (happening); euthanasia and the ‘demise pill’ (happening); limiting access to> affordable medical care makes eliminating the elderly easier (happening);> medicine would be tightly controlled (happening); elimination of private> doctors (happening in the alternative field with rest to come); new> difficult-to-diagnose and untreatable diseases (happening); suppressing cancer> cures as a means of population control (long been happening); inducing heart> attacks as a form of assassination (happening); education as a tool for> accelerating the onset of puberty and evolution (happening); blending all> religions ... the old religions will have to go (happening); changing the> Bible through revisions of key words (happening in ‘modern’ versions);> restructuring education as a tool of indoctrination (long been happening);> more time in schools, but pupils ‘wouldn’t learn anything’ (happening);> controlling who has access to information (happening); schools as the hub of> the community (to replace parents – happening); some books would just> disappear from the libraries (happening and the same with plans for websites> to disappear); changing laws to promote moral and social chaos (happening);> the encouragement of drug abuse to create a jungle atmosphere in cities and> town (happening); promote alcohol abuse (happening); restrictions on travel> (happening); the need for more jails, and using hospitals as jails (happening> and in the pipeline); no more psychological or physical security (happening);> crime used to manage society (happening); curtailment of US industrial> pre-eminence (long been happening); shifting populations and economies –> tearing out the social roots (happening); sports as a tool of social> engineering and change (happening); sex and violence inculcated through> entertainment (happening); implanted ID cards – microchips (happening); food> control (happening); weather control (happening); knowing how people respond –> making them do what you want (happening – see Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars);> falsified scientific research (happening – see ‘global warming’); use of> terrorism (happening); surveillance, implants, and televisions that watch you> (happening); the arrival of the totalitarian global system (happening).But don’t worry. There’s no conspiracy; it’s all a coincidence.Killing grannyOne of Richard Day’s predicted methods of reducing the population was said to be‘limiting access to affordable medical care [which] makes eliminating theelderly easier’. The tight control of medicine has been with us since oil tycoonand mega crook J D Rockefeller set out to impose scalpel and drug medicine andsuppress alternatives while having his own personal homeopath all his long life.What Day meant was that this suppression would become ever more extreme, whichit has. Eliminating the elderly is an important goal of the conspiracy. Theelderly are among the ‘useless eaters’, as Rothschild Zionist Henry Kissingerdescribes what he believes to be the lower forms of life. Lower than him?Impossible, surely. The bloodlines and their Archon masters only want adultscapable of serving their system and interests and children for their energy.Once people become too old or sick to be of use to these crazies they aredesignated a useless eater and ways are sought to eliminate them. I saw a storywhile I was writing this chapter headlined: ‘Elderly patients are being“deprived of food and drink so they die quicker and free up bed space”, claimdoctors’. The story explained how thousands of (allegedly) terminally-ill peopleare placed on a ‘care pathway’ (inversion) every year to hasten their death. Thereport did not surprise me because I highlighted this very policy in RememberWho You Are and I add the word ‘allegedly’ because it is clear that elderlypatients – and others – are being diagnosed as terminal and their deathsartificially advanced when they are not ‘terminal’ at all, especially within thetimescale of the so-called diagnosis. Doctors who do still have a heart tickingand generating even a modicum of compassion and empathy have confirmed this. Sixdoctors wrote to the UK Daily Telegraph to express their view that hospitals maybe (are) withholding food and drink from elderly patients to make them diequicker to cut costs and free bed spaces. They were talking about akill-them-quick scheme called the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) because it wasdeveloped at the Royal Liverpool Hospital in the 1990s. I am not sure, given thehistory of retaining children’s organs without parental permission at the AlderHey Children’s Hospital in the same city, that Liverpool is a good place to betaken ill at any age. We are looking at a We Don’t Care Pathway, a DeathPathway. It works like this: a doctor decides (often wrongly) that an elderlypatient is in the last days of life and fluids and drugs are then withheld toensure that they die quickly and there are many cases of this being done withouteven telling the person’s family. There are no goodbyes, no warning, andsuddenly their loved one is dead simply because the doctors decided that thisshould be so. The Telegraph reported that this was done with 29 percent ofpatients at the alleged end of their lives and not all of them elderly. Thisplays out in numbers as 130,000 people every year. Official figures show that20,000 people with dementia have been subjected to this state euthanasia everyyear who could not possibly give informed consent and 45 percent have beenunconscious when the decision was made by doctors. This is state murder; thereis no other credible description. The Telegraph revealed in a separate reporthow figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act confirmed that theBritish government was spending millions in bonuses to hospital trusts that mettheir target for ‘Pathway’ murders. Professor Mark Glaser, consultant oncologistat Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, said that the ‘Care Pathway’ was themost corrupt practice in British medicine and was used to clear bed space andmake money (and, I would add, to cull the ‘useless eaters’). He said that hewould not be treated in a British hospital. The six doctors who wrote the lettersaid that patient consent was not always being acquired or their opinion soughtwhile they were able to give it. They also pointed out that in the elderly anatural death is often more pain free. Dr Gillian Craig, a retired geriatricianand former vice-chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, told the Telegraph: ‘Ifyou are cynical about it, as I am, you can see it as a cost-cutting measure, ifyou don’t want your beds to be filled with old people.’ I am sure that, on thelower levels, this is a motivation, but this policy, and euthanasia in general,are stepping-stones to set the precedent of artificially taking life under theguise of compassion. Professor Patrick Pullicino, a consultant neurologist forEast Kent Hospitals, went even further in his condemnation of the death pathway.He said that it had become the equivalent of euthanasia of the elderly.Professor Pullicino said that he had intervened to take a patient off thepathway who went on to recover and return home. This showed that claims that thepatient had hours to live were ‘palpably false’. He added:> Very likely many elderly patients who could live substantially longer are> being killed by the [death pathway]. Patients are frequently put on the> pathway without any proper analysis of their condition. Predicting death in a> time frame of three to four days, or even any other specific time, is not> possible scientifically.> This determination in the LCP leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy. The> personal views of the physician or other medical team members of perceived> quality of life or low likelihood of a good outcome are probably central in> putting a patient on the [pathway]. If we accept the Liverpool Care Pathway we> accept euthanasia is part of the standard way of dying as it is now associated> with 29 percent of NHS deaths.As Dr Richard Day predicted in 1969: euthanasia and the ‘demise pill’; ‘limitingaccess to affordable medical care makes eliminating elderly easier’. Once abenchmark is set, or the foot is in the door, you expand the policy to evergreater extremes, widening the criteria and numbers as you go. Once you feel youhave enough Orwellian power over the community you can kill whoever you likewhenever you like. The outrage at the public exposure of the Liverpool Care(Death) Pathway led the UK government to announce in July, 2013 that it would bephased out over a year (why not immediately?) and replaced with another deathprocess. Watch them like a hawk.Bill’s backThe American ‘health’ policy known as Obamacare is also aimed at denying elderlypatients treatment. This involves an ‘advisory panel’ deciding what treatmentwill and won’t be paid for and these have, understandably, been dubbed ‘deathpanels’. This is a policy that has the support of yes, it’s him again, BillGates. Well, he’s consistent at least. The man talks so much bollocks almostevery time his lips smack together and I can’t believe that he doesn’t knowthat. Can he be that stupid? Or is it easier to be that devious? The perceivermust decide. Gates is also one of the most uninspiring, tedious andsleep-inducing of public speakers, for which I am extremely grateful. It wouldeven worse if he was good at it. Gates said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in AspenColorado in 2012 that there was a ‘lack of willingness’ to make choices betweenlaying-off teachers and ‘spending a million dollars on that last three months oflife for that patient’. It is not a choice that Gates will ever have to make forhimself and his family. He added that choosing between letting someone die andmore teachers was ‘called the death panel and you’re not supposed to have thatdiscussion’. Gates would love to, though, because that is where he is comingfrom. The way he pitched the argument was glaring manipulation and an attempt todivide and rule. Firstly, he picks a large figure of ‘a million dollars’ and ashort lifespan of three months to give an incredibly distorted and extreme viewof what these death panels will be deciding most of the time. Then he plays thatoff against teachers losing their jobs and harming the education (indoctrinationand programming) of children and the young. Gates said the choices had to bemade because of the state of the economy, when it is not in this state becausethe elderly are being kept alive, but because mega-banks and mega-corporationsfrom the very world of the mega-rich that Gates inhabits have been parasitizingto the tune of trillions from the very tax dollars and debt that the elderly –that he is quite okay to see die before their time – have contributed andserviced all their lives. If he wants to cut the cost of ‘health care’, or whatpasses for it, what about addressing some of the biggest parasites on PlanetEarth – Big Pharma? But, no, Gates won’t take on the pharmaceutical parasitesbecause he’s too busy handing them billions for vaccines through the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation to target the immune systems of children throughout theThird World. These very children fit the criteria of Kissinger’s useless eaters.Hey, and if don’t like your new born child – kill it quite legally. This is thestaggering suggestion in an article in the Journal of Medical Ethics entitled‘After-birth abortion: why should the baby live?’ There will be plenty ofEl-lite support for this, too. The authors were Alberto Giubilini from MilanUniversity and Francesca Minerva, a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre forApplied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne. Theysuggest that doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies if they aredisabled, too expensive or unwanted. If doctors and ludicrous academics likethese are deciding whether children have a moral right to life the world is inits death throes. There is nothing left but to deny it fluids and medication andsent it on its way. Take the world to Liverpool where the doctors can finish itoff. The authors say that a baby is like a foetus in that both lack theproperties to justify the right to being an individual. Rather than being‘actual persons’, newborns were ‘potential persons’. A bit like the authors,then.Healthcare is being run down as a whole for the same end. Astonishing amounts ofmoney are spent on the National Health Service (NHS) in Britain and in theprivate system in the United States and yet patient care plummets while themoney disappears down the plughole to administrators and Big Pharma. What canyou say about a healthcare system in which the biggest cause of death is the‘treatment’? There are still some good people working in the health industry,but there is also much incompetence and sheer evil. A 22-year-old man died fromthirst in 2012 while in a bed at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, South London.He even rang 999 and the police arrived after his requests for water wereignored. When they arrived they were sent away by ‘nurses’ who said that he was‘confused’. Staff were described as ‘lazy and incompetent’ which they weren’t,well, not only. They were criminally negligent and people are in jail for farless. Requests by the young man’s family for him to be given prescribedmedication to regulate his fluid levels were waved away and after he died onenurse asked a matron in front of his family if she could ‘bag him up’. Thecallous treatment of patients and people left alone on trolleys in corridors forhours on end are far from uncommon as the system implodes as it is designed to.If you want a certain type of system employ a certain type of person.Make no mistake: what Dr Richard Day so callously predicted from insiderknowledge in 1969 is happening, not least with the cull of the population onmultiple fronts. How interesting, and in no way coincidental, that his list ofsocietal changes is mirrored by the demands of Agenda 21 and Biodiversity."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00400.jpg]Climate ClaptrapEducation is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.SocratesThe foundation Big Lie being used to justify Agenda 21/Biodiversity is thathuman activity is changing the climate. I have demolished the ‘globalwarming/climate change’ idiocy in books like Human Race Get Off Your Knees andthere can be no one with a mind in any way activated that could not see that theclaims are patent nonsense.The very fact that this hoax has been fronted-up by the political scam-artistthat is Al Gore says it all, really. Anyone thought suitable by Bill Clinton(his masters) to be his vice-president has to have a doctorate in mendacity (Fig661). It is like asking if Tony Blair ever lies when the real question is: ‘Dohis lips move?’ Look at all the political prostitutes pushing the climate changeagenda and I rest my case – Gore, Obama, Blair, Cameron, Julia ‘Warm Eyes’Gillard in Australia and their like around the world. Al Gore is just anotherbloodline do-asyou’re-told gofer. He went to Vanderbilt University with a grantfrom the taxexempt Rockefeller Foundation which funds the Archontic agenda whilesaving the Rockefellers wads of cash on their no doubt already insanely smalltax bill. Gore’s daughter married into the Schiff banking family, the closeassociates of the Rothschilds who once lived in the same ‘Saturn red shield’house in Frankfurt. Jacob Schiff ran the Rothschild-front, Kuhn, Loeb andCompany which funded the Russian Revolution that put a symbol of Saturn on thecommunist flag. The now Karenna Gore Schiff would never in all eternity havebeen allowed to marry into the Schiff family if she was not Jewish. No way. Agreat supporter of Gore in his campaign to deceive the world has been DavidMayer de Rothschild, son of one of the family’s leading figures, Sir Evelyn deRothschild. Boy Rothschild officially wrote The Live Earth Global WarmingSurvival Handbook: 77 Essential Skills to Stop Climate Change – Or Live ThroughIt. This was a companion ‘guide’ to Gore’s ‘Live Earth’ concerts all around theworld designed to sell the Big Lie to the young. As usual with these events,Gore was supported by Bono, who appears to have a Who’s Who? of the globalEl-lite in his contacts book, and Madonna, dining partner of Edward ‘Black Eyes’Heath (Fig 662). Bill Gates is one of Bono’s buddies and he sang happy birthdayto Microsoft Man at a concert in Vancouver after delivering the most fawningbullshit about Gates’ contribution to a better world. Bono has joined the clubthat he once claimed to be challenging and the same with his mate Bob Geldof whowas pitching for capital in 2012 for his £125 million private equity company tofind ‘investment opportunities’ in the same African continent that he made hisname allegedly protecting from the consequences of Western ‘investment’(criminal exploitation). If you mean what you say then it’s for life, not forLive Aid. Bono is a climate change groupie promoting the lie just like his mate,Gates. Either he knows that or he is incredibly uninformed about what he issaying and the company that he keeps. Then there is this bloke Rajendra KPachauri, the railway engineer who heads the thoroughly-discredited UnitedNations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which has been theprime promoter of the ‘global warming’ propaganda, or ‘climate change’ as itbecame when temperatures began to fall year on year (Fig 663). Pachauri has beencaught out so many times misleading the public over ‘climate change’consequences, but won the now laughable Nobel Peace Prize (inversion) with AlGore in 2007 for promoting their bollocks (Fig 664). Mind you, if war criminalObama can win in it then surely Genghis Khan should be in line for entry intothe World Peace Hall of Fame. The IPCC was established by the United NationsEnvironment Programme and the World Meteorological Organisation ‘to provide theworld with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climatechange and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts’. Okay, sowhen is it going to start? Pachauri advises companies such as Pegasus CapitalAdvisors, GloriOil, the Chicago Climate Exchange (Maurice Strong/Al Gore),Toyota, Deutsche Bank and NTPC (formerly the National Thermal PowerCorporation). In fact, Business Week names him as a founder of Glori Energy/Oil,Inc. in 2005. How very green. Dr Arun D Ahluwalia, an Indian geologist and boardmember of the UN-supported International Year of the Planet, said of Pachauriand his organisation:[../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 661: Al Gore, High Priest of the Climate Cult.[../Images/00368.jpg]Figure 662: Billo, Killo and Bono.[../Images/00367.jpg]Figure 663: Rajendra K Pachauri – ‘Mr Rothschild and Mr Rockefeller told me thatwhen the temperature rises it is caused by human activity and when it doesn’trise for more than a decade this too is caused by the same human activity andboth are equally a threat to the world.

Pachauri addressed a UNESCOconference in 2009 on how the media should most effectively promote the Big Lie:> Earlier speakers have referred to the importance of bringing about behavioural> changes – and may I submit that these behavioural changes would essentially be> in the nature of changes in lifestyles [see Agenda 21 and Biodiversity].

The fact that large and increasing numbers of mainstreamscientists are challenging the climate change orthodoxy, including many of thosewho once supported it, is not a balance worth reporting? This is the mentalitythat stands between what is happening in the world and what people are told ishappening. How depressing. No wonder Peter Sissons, the veteran news anchor,left the BBC in protest at its bias, not least over climate change. The BBCmanagement decided that the scientific argument over climate change had been wonand so there was no need to provide any alternative view. Sissons said:[../Images/00253.jpg]Figure 665: This is the truth, but it is ignored because the global warming hoaxis crucial to justifying Agenda 21.> ... it is effectively BBC policy, enthusiastically carried out by the BBC> environment correspondents, that those views should not be heard – witness the> BBC statement last year that ‘BBC News currently takes the view that their> reporting needs to be calibrated to take into account the scientific consensus> that global warming is man-made’.The BBC is one of most biased broadcasting networks on earth (even with all thecompetition) while claiming in its legendary pomposity to be the mosttrustworthy. How much airtime has Mr Kirby and the BBC given to scientist andengineer David Evans, a full-time or part-time consultant for eleven years tothe Australian Greenhouse Office (now the Department of Climate Change) who saidthat the debate about global warming had reached crazy proportions: ‘I am ascientist who was on the carbon gravy train, understands the evidence, was oncean alarmist, but am now a skeptic.’ Evans said that the whole idea that carbondioxide is the main cause of the recent warming was based ‘on a guess that wasproved false by empirical evidence during the 1990s, but the gravy train was toobig, with too many jobs, industries, trading profits, political careers, and thepossibility of world government and total control riding on the outcome’. Noticethat – world government. He added that ‘the governments and their tame climatescientists now outrageously maintain the fiction that carbon dioxide is adangerous pollutant’, rather than admit they are wrong even when the evidence isoverwhelming. Evans is so right on many counts: the ‘science’ is a nonsense; theclimate change confidence-trick is being maintained, as all con-tricks must be,by incessant lies; and it is being used as a No-Problem-Reaction-Solution tojustify world government to ‘save the planet’ (see Agenda 21/Biodiversity).Britain’s Met Office (formerly Meteorological Office) has been one of the towncriers for human-caused climate change and yet its own monthly figures reveal nostatistically significant increase in the world’s temperature since 1997 andthey now predict this will continue for years (Fig 665). The Met Office saidthat it did not take enough account of ‘natural variability’. No, they did notbother to take account of anything that told another story to the one they weremade responsible for selling to the public. The Met temperature data wasrevealed by the London Mail on Sunday which has challenged the official storyand the paper rightly said that this amounted to an admission ‘that earlierforecasts – which have dictated years of Government policy and will cost tens ofbillions of pounds – were wrong.’ But what changed as a result of theserevelations? Nothing whatsoever because the Archontic agenda does not take nofor an answer unless we make it so. They know they are lying and they are notgoing to change course when they have a planet to bring to heel. The Mail onSunday article described how the manipulation of the climate change lie goesabout its business:> Surely the Met Office would trumpet this important news, as it has done when> publishing warnings of imminent temperature rises. But there was no fanfare.> Instead, it issued the revised forecast on the ‘research’ section of its> website – on Christmas Eve.

The new data undercut assertionsthat atmospheric carbon dioxide is causing a global warming crisis. Atmosphericcarbon dioxide levels rose 2.67 parts per million to 395 ppm, the second highestsince 1959, but global temperatures are the same today as they were in the 1990swhen atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were only 360 ppm. Atmospheric carbondioxide levels rose 10 percent between 1995 and 2012, but global temperaturesdid not rise at all. This follows the 30-year decline in temperatures betweenthe 1940s and 1970s in a period in which atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rosenearly 10 percent. But still the warming cult clings on to its insanity. TheReuters news agency even ran a story with the headline ‘“Missing” global heatmay hide in deep oceans’. So desperate are ‘researchers’ to account for the lackof warming that they said the heat might be ‘hiding’. Hiding? What is it doing,peering through the bushes or wearing a disguise? A snowman outfit might be best(Fig 666). Reuters reported:> The mystery of Earth’s missing heat may have been solved: it could lurk deep> in oceans, temporarily masking the climate-warming effects of greenhouse gas> emissions, researchers reported on Sunday. Climate scientists have long> wondered where this so-called missing heat was going, especially over the last> decade, when greenhouse emissions kept increasing but world air temperatures> did not rise correspondingly.How about that it was never there in the first place? Most of the funding forthe climate change studies comes from Archon bloodline sources and the datainvolved is provided by bloodline sources in government agencies. James Hansen,director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, is one of the majorfigures behind the climate change hoax and has been exposed for fixing data. Astudy called Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature, which supports the officialstory, gleaned its data from that provided by government-controlled NASA and theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This is funded by the ArchonticCharles G Koch Charitable Foundation and the Fund for Innovative Climate andEnergy Research, an organisation established by Bill Gates. All this crap aboutthe need to develop alternative power sources like wind power and the ‘greenjobs’ that this will create is just a deliberate diversion and a means throughwhich public money can be handed to cronies. The Obama administrationdistributed $9 billion in economic ‘stimulus’ funds to solar and wind projectsbetween 2009 and 2011 which created the grand total of 910 direct jobs (at acost of $1.9 million per job). Meanwhile the same people suppress and block thedevelopment of free-energy technology that taps in to the natural electrical,electromagnetic and vibrational energy fields all around us. By ‘free’ I mean interms of both the technology producing more energy than it takes to operate andat no cost once the technology is in place. This technology was discovered andoperated by scientific genius Nikola Tesla in the first half of the 20th centurybut covered up and suppressed by the same forces that now say that new energysources are needed to save the planet. It’s all a friggin’ hoax to give them theexcuse to transform human society à la The Hunger Games and, irony of ironies,to geoengineer the climate and the planetary atmosphere. Bill Gates even fundedan experiment (and experiment means that you do not know the outcome) in whichthousands of tonnes of sun-reflecting sulphur particles are planned to besprayed into the sky over New Mexico by two Harvard engineers using a balloonflying at 80,000 feet. The idea is to artificially cool the atmosphere to saveus from global warming when human-caused global warming is a fiction. Gates isall for geoengineering the climate and the Archon bloodlines are all forgeoengineering the climate, as we shall see. The same Gates-Archon synchronicitycan be found with vaccines, depopulation, GM crops in Africa and the cashlesssociety. The Archontic agenda and the Gates agenda move as if liberally smearedwith superglue and his taxexempt foundation is his vehicle on the basis thatmoney talks. Even leading environmentalists oppose what Gates is doing with thesulphur experiment. Doug Parr, the chief UK scientist for Greenpeace, describedit as ‘outlandish’ and ‘dangerous’. Funnily enough the putrid smell of sulphuris commonly reported by people during interactions and abductions by theArchontic entities in their various forms. Another ‘climate change’ proposal isto ‘fertilise the ocean with iron to spur blooms of carbonsucking plankton’which has the potential to destroy all marine life just as spraying sulphateinto the stratosphere can devastate weather patterns and the atmosphere ingeneral. Alan Robock, a meteorologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, saidthat his computer simulations suggested that sulphur in the atmosphere couldreduce rainfall on which billions of people depend for food production. Well,that’s good isn’t it? Think of the benefits for Agenda 21 and the populationcull. Robock’s view about the dangers of sulphur is widely supported by thosewho have researched the potential consequences. The US Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) warns about the connections between sulphur in the atmosphere andacid rain:> Acid rain causes acidification of lakes and streams and contributes to the> damage of trees at high elevations (for example, red spruce trees above 2,000> feet) and many sensitive forest soils. In addition, acid rain accelerates the> decay of building materials and paints, including irreplaceable buildings,> statues, and sculptures that are part of our nation’s cultural heritage. Prior> to falling to the earth, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) gases> and their particulate matter derivatives – sulfates and nitrates – contribute> to visibility degradation and harm public health.So what is the EPA doing about the Gates experiment? Nothing. The USEnvironmental Protection Agency wants to destroy the people, not the El-lite.The EPA is just another Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers forDisease Control (CDC) and serves the Archontic agenda with its tongue on 24 hourstand-by waiting for orders. These are some of the health consequences ofsulphur as reported by Paul Joseph Watson at prisonplanet.com: Neurologicaleffects and behavioural changes; disturbance of blood circulation; heart damage;effects on eyes and eyesight; reproductive failure; damage to immune systems;stomach and gastrointestinal disorder; damage to liver and kidney functions;hearing defects; disturbance of the hormonal metabolism; dermatological effects;suffocation and lung embolism. Is that enough for Mr Gates? Who are these peopleto impose their will on the world? He comes from a software company and she isthe wife of someone who comes from a software company and they think they can dowhat they bloody like to people and the planet. Oh, it’s the money? Gotcha.Money talks and so do Bill and Melinda Gates on the back of it.[../Images/00315.jpg]Figure 667: The ratio of greenhouse gases. What a joke it would be if theconsequences for humanity were not so serious.Some sanity if you please ...How many people know – clearly not most of the mainstream media – that carbondioxide is a very minor greenhouse gas that represents only 0.037 percent of theatmosphere and a fraction of greenhouse gases? Even then most of it is naturaland not generated by human activity. More than 96 percent of theessential-to-life greenhouse effect is caused by water vapour and clouds (Fig667). Small as the percentage of carbon dioxide may be we still would not behere if it didn’t exist and the same with the greenhouse effect itself; and yetboth are being demonised by the propaganda. The Archon-controlled US SupremeCourt ruled that carbon dioxide (which we produce when we breathe out) is an airpollutant subject to federal regulation under the Clean Air Act. Theimplications of that ruling for human freedom and a totalitarian dictatorshipare utterly immense. CO2 is pollutant when it is an essential element of lifeitself? It has even been proposed in Washington State by Representative EdOrcutt (he has very short hair) that there be a $25 ‘bike tax’ to acknowledgethe increased carbon dioxide that cyclists are breathing out because of theirincreased heart rate while pedalling. I so wish that was a joke, oh, so much,but unfortunately it isn’t. We are truly in the land of crazies except that,deep in the rabbit hole, they know it is crazy and only a means to an end. EvenDr Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, has rejected the global warmingorthodoxy. He said:> We should challenge them to admit that CO2 is the most important nutrient for> all life on earth and to admit that it is proven in lab and field experiments> that plants would grow much faster if CO2 levels were 4-5 times higher in the> atmosphere than they are today.> This is why greenhouse growers pipe the exhaust from their gas and wood> heaters back into the greenhouse to increase CO2 levels 3-5 times the level in> the atmosphere, resulting in 50-100% increase in growth of their crops.

Long live the humans.The climate is always changing over time and there can be periods when itchanges more quickly. This change is generated by cycles of solar activity –measured by the number of sunspots which are caused in periods of high cycles ofelectrical power, as I described earlier (Fig 668). Ever noticed that it getswarmer when the sun comes out? Scientists at the world’s most prestigiousphysics laboratory at CERN in Switzerland measured a near perfect correlationbetween climate change and the penetration of cosmic rays into the Earth’satmosphere (Fig 669). These findings were suppressed at first because theydidn’t support the songsheet, but they were released after the gag order wasexposed. Is it really a revelation that the Sun drives the Earth’s temperatureand not carbon dioxide? In recent decades this has also been increasingly doneby technological manipulation of the climate which I will be coming to. All thedire predictions from the global warming fanatics have proven to be wrong and astemperatures have failed to play ball with these crazies the data has beendoctored and manipulated to make it fit the premise of the Big Lie.[../Images/00224.jpg]Figure 668: Anyone think that the Sun might affect the temperature?[../Images/00130.jpg]Figure 669: The CERN findings confirm the bloody obvious – the clear connectionbetween cosmic rays and Earth temperature.If in doubt, scare them shitless (and lie)The New Scientist magazine was still saying in 2012 that ‘climate change isalready upon us, melting ice, killing forests and making floods and heatwavesmore intense’ while global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhousegases ‘continue to increase, promising far worse to come’. Thisscientifically-ridiculous article said that even if we stopped all emissionstomorrow ‘temperatures would keep rising for decades, with potentiallycatastrophic consequences ranging from famines to rapid sea-level rise’. Then wegot to the real point with ‘the hope is that by deliberately tinkering with ourplanet’s climate machine, we might be able to fix our gargantuan blunder, or atleast avoid some of the most serious consequences, or just buy ourselves a bitmore time to cut emissions’. Ahhh, we got there in the end, then: changing theclimate and indeed the very atmosphere itself. I’ll explain later why this ishappening and why Bill Gates and his sulphur are an example of something ofenormous significance. Al Gore went AWOL after emails came to light to revealthat the Climatic Research Unit at the UK’s University of East Anglia, a majorglobal source of ‘climate change data’, had been fixing the statistics to maketheir claims look real. Researchers asked for the original climate data on whichthe predictions were made to be released under the Freedom of Information Act,but the Climate Unit said that this data had been ‘lost’. Bloody liars. GerdLeipold, the International Executive Director of Greenpeace, admitted that apress release claiming that Arctic ice would disappear by 2030 could not besubstantiated. These global warmers think of a number and double it, then thinkof a climate disaster and multiply it a thousandfold. But it doesn’t matter. Itis not lying or anything. You see, Leipold said that he did not apologise for‘emotionalising issues’ as if making dire claims that cannot be substantiatedare somehow okay so long as you are emotional about it. Their computer models onwhich they base their baloney are rarely on the same planet (Fig 670). WhenArctic ice was reduced to the lowest it has been since satellite records beganin 1979 (oh, way back then), the warmers predicted that all ice would be goneduring the summer within five years. Of course, it never happened. Somethingsimilar occurred in 2012 and off they went again. ‘Scientists’ issued a pressrelease about ‘unprecedented Greenland ice sheet surface melt’, but they alsosaid, in the same release, that ‘melting events of this type occur about onceevery 150 years on average with the last one happening in 1889’. So whathappened to ‘unprecedented’? Carbon dioxide emissions were far less in 1889 thanthey are today and what caused the melt 150 years before that – turbo-chargedwater mills? NASA later said that the Greenland melt in 2012 had been caused toa large extent by a severe cyclone which had pushed large amounts of the icecover into warmer waters where it melted. NASA temperature records show that theArctic was much warmer in the 1930s than in the more than 80 years since then.Meanwhile, hardly mentioned by the climate cult and its mainstream media PRmachine like the BBC, the Antarctic ice sheet has reached almost record levelsfor either pole in the last few years. An alleged huge spike in globaltemperatures in modern times became known as the ‘hockey stick’ because the linein the temperature graph suddenly went skyward; but this has now been totallydiscredited (Fig 671). The graph deleted the so-called medieval warm period thebest part of a thousand years ago when temperatures were much higher than now.What caused that, turbo-charged hay carts? Journalist and writer ChristopherBooker, author of The Real Global Warming Disaster, described the ‘hockey stick’lie as ‘one of the most comprehensively discredited artefacts in the history ofscience’. Lord Christopher Monckton, a former policy advisor to British PrimeMinister, Margaret Thatcher, and a vociferous critic of the climate changepropaganda, wrote:[../Images/00038.jpg]Figure 670: The fact and the fantasy.[../Images/00080.jpg]Figure 671: The manufactured ‘hockey stick’.> Scores of scientific papers show that the medieval warm period was real,> global and up to 3C warmer than now.

So the UN> adjusted the maths and all but extinguished the sun’s role in today’s warming.Some of the emails exposed at the Climatic Research Unit were discussing howthey could rid the data of the medieval warm period because it blew the theorythat temperatures are unusually high. Another point is that after the warmperiod came the Little Ice Age when temperatures were so constantly low thatthey held ice fairs on the frozen River Thames every winter. Temperatures wereat their lowest in the late 17th century and gradually climbed, with ups anddowns, into the 20th century in line with changing solar activity (Figs 672 and673). The data manipulation involved ignoring the very existence of the medievalwarm period and then comparing temperatures today with the period of the LittleIce Age to make it seem that we were in a potential catastrophic period ofwarming. It is because the claims were based on manipulation and not the realitythat sea levels have not risen as predicted; icecaps have not melted aspredicted; glaciers have not melted as predicted; polar bear numbers are stableor growing and not falling as predicted. Christopher Booker said at the time ofthe Copenhagen UN Climate Change Conference in late 2009:[../Images/00378.jpg]Figure 672: The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. Try playing hockeywith that.[../Images/00402.jpg]Figure 673: Earth temperature and sunspots. The lowest point of sunspotactivity, known as the Maunder Minimum, brought the Little Ice Age.> As the world has already been through two of its coldest winters for decades,> with all the signs that we may now be entering a third, the scientific case> for CO2 threatening the world with warming has been crumbling away on an> astonishing scale.> Yet it is at just this point that the world’s politicians, led by Britain, the> EU and now President Obama, are poised to impose on us far and away the most> costly set of measures that any group of politicians has ever proposed in the> history of the world – measures so destructive that even if only half of them> were implemented, they would take us back to the dark ages.Now we are getting to the whole point of all this. You know when a course ofaction based on claims which have been demolished is continued regardless of theevidence that you are looking at an important pillar of the agenda. ‘Climatechange’ is less a pillar and more a foundation stone. So much is being justifiedby this fiction which is indeed leading us back into dark ages – into Agenda 21and The Hunger Games. It was all planned a long, long time ago and the Club ofRome, another Round Table satellite along with the Bilderberg Group, TrilateralCommission and others, was specifically established in 1968 to exploit thefictitious human-caused climate change and other environmental issues to justifyAgenda 21. Aurelio Peccei, a founder of the Club of Rome, wrote in theorganisation’s 1991 publication, The First Global Revolution: ‘In searching fora new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat ofglobal warming, water shortages, famine, and the like would fit the bill ... Allof these are caused by human intervention ... The real enemy, then, is humanityitself.’ Yes, and because humanity is ‘the enemy’ it must be culled and what isleft of it herded into fenced-off sectors where it can do no more harm. The‘real enemy, then, is humanity itself’ – is that is not an Archon talking? Thosewho have caused the environmental damage, fictitious in part but also very realin terms of pollution of water supplies, irradiating the atmosphere, destroyingthe rainforests and poisoning the land, are planning to head for the HungerGames ‘capitols’. It doesn’t seem to dawn on the unthinking, unquestioning,deeply naïve and uninformed Green fanatics that the people promoting and drivingthe climate change agenda – and profiting from it through carbon trading (see AlGore) and other means – are those behind the banks and corporations, includingthe oil cartel, that are dismantling the ecosystem. The Rockefeller family hasput multi-millions into the Green movement for goodness sake. The Club of Romeis pressing for a global carbon tax and a ‘new economic order’ in line with thebloodline agenda and look at some of the pump-primers of the Green movement –eugenicists Julian Huxley, first director-general of UNESCO, Prince Philip ofthe House of Windsor, and Prince Bernhard, the long-time chairman of theBilderberg Group. These characters could have cared less about the planet?Prince Philip doesn’t care about wildlife; he’s spent much of his time shootingit. Humanity is wildlife to him, too, as it is with all the others. Human-causedclimate change is a scientific insanity as so many scientists who once boughtthe manipulated consensus are now saying. James Lovelock who predicted horrificconsequences from climate change now admits that his views were alarmist. ‘Allright, I made a mistake’, he said. You can read the detailed background to theBig Lie in The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy. With the scientificconsensus now in free-fall some very strange people are left in the ‘for’ camp,real extremists like Professor Kari Norgaard of Oregon University who hascompared those challenging the official story on climate change to people whosupport racism and slavery (Fig 674). This intellectual giant decreed that theywere suffering from a mental disorder that had to be ‘treated’. She said thatwhat she called ‘cultural resistance [seeing climate change orthodoxy as thebollocks that it is] ... must be recognised and treated’ as an aberrantsociological behavior. The same Ms Norgaard wrote to Barack Obama tocongratulate him on appointing the eugenicist John P Holdren as his chiefscience advisor. Norgaard even described Holden as a ‘Nobel Peace Prize winner’which he isn’t, although his views on population culling are so extreme that Iam surprised the award has so far eluded him. Holden co-wrote the bookEcoscience, published in 1977, which called for mandatory sterilisation andabortions along with drugs in the water supply to stop pregnancies, as I saidearlier. Norgaard told Obama: ‘Policymakers should not wait for public opinionto take necessary action ... Public opinion does matter in a democracy, but thisis a time when following it would be a serious mistake.’ Or maybe Ms Norgaard isthe serious mistake. She reminds me of Caroline Lucas, the British Green PartyMember of Parliament, who said that climate change had to be treated as a‘national security issue’. A bloke called Ed Davey was made UK governmentClimate Change Secretary in early 2013 and immediately branded ‘climate changedeniers’ as ‘dogmatic and blinkered’ and pronounced that evidence forhuman-caused global warming ‘screams out from decade upon decade of research’.He told an event at the Archontic Royal Society that those questioning theclimate change orthodoxy ‘want us to take a huge gamble with the future of everyhuman being on the planet, every future human being, our children andgrandchildren, and every other living species’. Actually, it is a far biggergamble with all those things having Lib-Dem Davey as a government ministertalking claptrap like this: ‘Two hundred years of good science – teasing outuncertainties, considering risk – has laid the foundation of what we nowunderstand. It screams out from decade upon decade of research.’ How does heknow? His previous job was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for EmploymentRelations, Consumer and Postal Affairs. These people just drift bewilderedlybetween government departments where their civil servants tell them what tothink and say. Davey’s full title is Secretary of State for Energy and ClimateChange which today really means Secretary of State for Using Climate Change AsAn Excuse To Increase The Price of Energy. Contrast this Davey/Lucas nonsensewith the views of Dr Vincent Gray, a retired scientist who has spent more than20 years in climate science with no ties to selfinterested parties. He hasreviewed the IPCC reports and written books on the climate change delusion. Hesaid:[../Images/00185.jpg]Figure 674: Professor Kari Norgaard of Oregon University said that ‘climatechange deniers’ were suffering from a mental disorder that had to be‘treated’.Mmmmm.> The 1992 Rio Conference endorsed a legally binding definition of ‘Climate> Change’ that the climate is largely controlled by human-produced trace gases.> They wished to show that the globe is warming, but this cannot be done as it> is impossible to measure the average temperature of the earth ...> ...

They intimidated> editors of scientific journals to control the ‘peer review’ process in their> favour. They took control of many university departments, national science> organisations and media outlets. People who tell the truth are intimidated.This is what has really happened. There is a whole army of ‘green’,‘progressive’ and ‘activist’ organisations pushing the climate change officialline including the George Soros-funded MoveOn.org (heavily involved in the ArabSpring propaganda), Avaaz (co-founded by MoveOn.org) and the Rockefeller-funded350.org. Personally, I wouldn’t trust any of them as far as I could throw a bus.Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, who talks the most extraordinary rubbish,actually said in an interview that he didn’t know or couldn’t remember who fundshis climate change-extremist operation. You’ve got to laugh really, buteventually the name Rockefeller was squeezed out of him.So why the lie?The illusion of human-caused climate change is a crucial part of the plan todeindustrialise the world in preparation for Agenda 21 and this is a primereason behind the economic disaster that was coldly engineered over decadesleading up to the crash of 2008 and what has followed. The economic squeeze onthe population is being increased by substantially raising energy prices throughcarbon laws and this both fills the vaults of the Archontic power companies andfurther crushes the population financially (the ‘price shocks’ of Silent Weaponsfor Quiet Wars). We have seen this clearly in Australia under the liar that isformer Prime Minister Julia Gillard who came to power saying that she would notintroduce a carbon tax and then did just that – as she knew she would when shesaid that she wouldn’t. Gillard said: ‘There will be no carbon tax under thegovernment I lead.’ Wayne Swan, Australian deputy prime minister and treasurer,said: ‘Certainly we reject this hysterical allegation that we are moving towardsa carbon tax.’ These people are Archontic inverters and you have to reversewhatever they say. When Gillard claims to be a kind-hearted soul who cares aboutAustralia and its people then all you have to do is reverse the meaning to seewhat she is really saying. Gillard said that prices would not increase with thecarbon tax (based on what she knows is the lie of human-caused climate change)because it would be paid by the power companies; but everyone knew that priceswould soar – and they have. The Melbourne Herald reported how a family wascharged an extra $55 in funeral costs because of the carbon tax. ‘Even the deaddon’t escape the carbon tax’, the family were told. One of the relatives asked:> What carbon could possibly be used by putting a man in a grave? All they did> was put the dirt back in. How can they charge us a carbon tax for burying> someone?The answer is that they don’t need to answer. They are taxing people till thepips squeak at every opportunity to bring the masses to their knees financially.Within weeks of the carbon tax being introduced on July 1st, 2012 theconsequences began. A fruit packaging firm said that it would have to startsacking workers after receiving a post-tax power bill of more than $10,500 aboveaverage. Sports clubs reduced community programmes because of electricity billsand small businesses were saying they could not complete with the corporationsdue to the increase in power costs – exactly what the Archon bloodlines andtheir representatives in the Australian Government want. Food prices weresoaring, too, another goal of the El-lite, and this included school meals. Thecost of running Victoria’s public transport systems was predicted to increase byas much as $53 million because of the carbon tax and all following the lie thatit would not be introduced and the lie about human-caused climate change itself.A fossil-fuel tax to be introduced by the British Government in 2013 is alsodestined to make the cost of energy skyrocket and further devastate the economyand what they have done in Australia is planned for everywhere. Australia is oneof the most controlled countries on earth in terms of those considered ‘Western’in economy and government, and its population is one of the most spied-uponanywhere in the world. This is directly connected to the fact that Australia isalso one of the global centres of the conspiracy thanks to the British Empireand its satanic importance to the bloodlines comes from the residual energystill there from the land mass of Lemuria of which it was once a part. Australiahas had many prime ministers that were or are practicing Satanists, but it isfar from alone in that to say the least. Gillard and company came up with agreat idea to stop the price rises they said would not happen – but have – frombeing exposed. They have banned businesses from saying that price increases aredue to the carbon tax. These people really are straight out of Nazi Germany.What are you doing, Australia, allowing these little shits to dictate yourlives? Who the hell are they? The same goes for any of their successors – andfor the United States, Britain, Canada and everywhere else. The Australian DailyTelegraph reported that shops and restaurants could face fines of up to $1.1million if waiters or sales staff wrongly blame the carbon tax for price risesor exaggerate the impact. Dr Michael Schaper, deputy chairman of the AustralianCompetition and Consumer Commission, said that the law includes ‘... commentsmade by staff over the phone, on the shop floor or in meetings ... advertising,product labels, websites, invoices, contracts and contract negotiations’. Afitness club was fined $6,600 by the Australian Competition and ConsumerCommission for asking members to take advantage of renewing their membershipbefore fees were increased as a result of carbon taxation. Gillard’s governmentknew that carbon taxation would increase the price of almost everything – thoughthey lied to deny it – and these laws have been imposed to stop the truemagnitude of those price increases being recorded. They are being enforced byteams of ‘carbon cops’ walking the streets conducting random inspections ofbusinesses to ensure they are not making any reference to the tax which ismaking the rich richer and destroying jobs and livelihoods while making almosteverything more expensive; at the same time it is adding yet another layer tothe fascist ‘green police’ enforcement networks of Agenda 21. What has been donein Australia is so bad that Barack Obama called it ‘a model for the world’.Miranda Devine, columnist with The Daily Telegraph and Herald Sun, wrote:> It’s all very Orwellian: the tax whose name cannot be spoken. We are already> paying for the climate-change hysteria that has gripped Australia for a> decade. But no matter how Orwellian the tactics, no matter how many carbon> cops are sent into hairdressing salons to interrogate barbers on the precise> nature of their price rises, the truth remains: Australia has gone out on a> limb, imposing a carbon tax that will send businesses to the wall, cause undue> hardship to families, and tether Australians more tightly to government> handouts.All of these things are on the ‘must-do’ list for Agenda 21 which demands thedestruction of small and medium-sized businesses and even bigger ones to leave amonopoly for the Archontic corporations. The more people lose their incomes, themore who are dependent on the state and forced to do whatever the state demands(or think they are) the more will be herded into the nightmare world of Agenda21. The same is happening in Britain and across the planet where carbon taxationis being imposed to drive up the price of energy and everything that uses energyat a time of extreme economic downturn. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)was reported to be demanding that Americans pay another $1.40 per gallon of fuelto ‘protect the climate’ which would cost an estimated $500 billion – more thanthree percent of annual economic output at a time of severe (engineered)recession. This is another weapon being used to destroy the ability of people tofend for themselves so they can be forced into the rabbit-hutch prison camps ofAgenda 21. You can see now the reason for the engineered economic crash andsetting the precedent in Cyprus of stealing the peoples’ money from theirprivate bank accounts and why this is being sanctioned in other countries.Carbon trading or ‘credits’ are planned to be the foundation of the cashlessmoney system, too. People would be given a carbon allowance for energy in asystem run by the mega banks that have systematically crashed the global economy– Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and their like. Anything purchasedwould be priced according to its carbon significance. You can see now why theBig Lie of human-caused climate change is so crucial to everything. The energycredits would have to be used within a certain period or become invalid somaking it impossible for people to accrue personal wealth or a ‘nest egg’(except for the El-lite). This society would be directed by a technocracy ofappointed ‘experts’ and academics with little things like voting confined tohistory. I had finished this chapter when a bunch of climate crazies andpopulation cullers from the American Institute of Biological Sciences publisheda paper that confirmed yet again what ‘climate change’ is all about in a papercalled ‘Social Norms and Global Environmental Challenges’. The group includedrepresentatives from the main Agenda 21 subjects areas including behaviouralscientists, mathematicians and economists, biologists, and people-cullers suchas Paul Ehrlich and Gretchen C Daily, the long-term collaborators with Obamascience ‘czar’ and population extremist, John P Holdren. The ‘paper’ wasstraight from the pages of Agenda 21 with the usual justification of saving theplanet from the alleged horrors of climate change:> Substantial numbers of people will have to alter their existing behaviors to> address this new class of global environmental problems. Alternative> approaches are needed when education and persuasion alone are insufficient.> Policy instruments such as penalties, regulations, and incentives may> therefore be required to achieve significant behavior modification.They call basically for organisations run by scientists operating through theUnited Nations (pure Agenda 21) to oversee this global programme of socialengineering in just the way envisaged by Archontic writers like ZbigniewBrzezinski who predict the technetronic (post-industrial, post democratic)society. The pea-brain paper calls for ‘government policies intended to alterchoices and behaviors that include ‘active norm management, changing theconditions influencing behaviors, financial interventions, and regulatorymeasures’.What was that again? ‘Active norm management.’ I bet George Orwell is kickinghimself for not coming up with that one. What I am exposing here is not aconspiracy ‘theory’, it is very real and even more than that – it’s happeningwhile the world looks on."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00078.jpg]Stealing the WorldHe who is not contented with what he has would not be contented with what hewould like to have.SocratesThe poor get ever more desperate while the tiny El-lite grow ever moregrotesquely rich. The sectors and the Capitol are already here. It is just acase of completing the job – unless we intervene – and to do this they need tocontrol access to food, water and shelter and put people in such dire economicstraits that the only way they can get their minimal quota of food, water andshelter is to do whatever they are told.This includes submitting to human microchipping; mandatory sterilisation;compulsory vaccination of whatever chemical cocktail of deadly or mentally,emotionally, physically manipulating shite that the El-lite choose to put in thesyringe; living where you are told to live in the conditions that you are toldto live in; working where and when you are told to work; handing completecontrol of your children to the state – even handing them over so you don’t seethem again. How different is that to Greek parents selling or giving theirchildren away because they can no longer feed them? Those that Americans callthe middle class are being targeted with economic strife because they have beenthe bedrock of the US economy. They know that if the middle class collapses theneverything else will go with it except for those right at the top. Most peoplehave no idea of the shocking disparity already between the super-rich andeveryone else, but put these words into a search engine and you can see a videoreport on where we are in regard to this: ‘The Inequitable Distribution ofWealth in America Depicted’. It reveals how the middle class is disappearing andthat the richest one percent own 40 percent of America’s wealth while the bottom80 percent has only 7 percent between them all. The top one percent took 9percent of annual national income in 1976 but today it is 24 percent andgrowing. The top one percent own 50 percent of the stocks, bonds and mutualfunds while the bottom 50 percent own half a percent. A CEO earns closing in on400 times the salary of an average employee who has to work for a month to earnwhat a CEO earns in an hour. A Hunger Games society? We are heading there sofast (Fig 675). There is no limit to what the El-lite can impose once the masseshave no income, no access to food and water and the very basics of survival (Fig676). This is where we are going and this is why Dr Richard Day said in 1969:‘The supply and distribution of food will be monitored so that no one can givefood to a fugitive of the system.’ They want to control everything. The phrase‘Give me Liberty, or give me death’ comes to mind because I will leave thiscrazy world before I will take this crap. The United States Government, bankingsystem and military have served the bloodlines magnificently in previous stagesof the plan, but now another stage is well underway and the cookies are plannedto crumble into a different structure. Father Bush, Bill Clinton, Boy Bush andBarack Obama all know this and were put into power to be the enemy within interms of the American population. Follow their actions over the years, as I havein previous books, and you see that despite the speeches and rhetoric thedecisions and policy changes have led incessantly in the same direction ofAgenda 21, whether Republican or Democrat, in America’s one-party state. FatherBush signed the United States into Agenda 21 at the Earth Summit in 1992 andClinton, Boy Bush and Obama have all advanced its plans through PresidentialExecutive Orders in which the president imposes policy with simply a signatureand there is no debate on Capitol Hill – not that this would change anythingmost of the time. This is not only happening in the United States, either. It isbeing implemented in Britain, across Europe and the rest of the world.[../Images/00032.jpg]Figure 675: Where they want us all to be.[../Images/00025.jpg]Figure 676: The number of homeless and destitute is growing at a fantastic rateall over the world.Clearing the landThe division between the mega rich and the poverty stricken may be becoming evermore obvious and extreme as the masses are denied access to work and income inever greater numbers and the state hangs them out to dry in ‘austerityprogrammes’ (Fig 677). This also drives people out of their homes withforeclosures and a major demand on the Agenda 21 hit-list is the end of privateproperty (except for those in the Capitol). But the people still have to beremoved from the land and herded into the sector cities of high-rise,closely-packed ‘human settlement zones’ as demanded by Agenda 21. This ishappening on a gathering scale but you don’t hear about most of it because itgoes unreported by the mainstream propaganda media controlled by the sameArchontic network that is imposing Agenda 21. We have already reached the stagein this process in London where thousands of poor adults and children are beingcompulsorily removed from the capital – Capitol – and located 200 miles away.This has been described as social-cleansing, which it is ... Agenda 21social-cleansing. Councils have decided that government cutbacks in housingbenefits to the poor mean they will not be able to afford the rents and must bemoved out. One mother affected said something very telling from the perspectivethat I am describing here: ‘It seems like the government just wants London forthe rich. They want to move people on benefits to poor areas.’ This is preciselywhat they are doing in line with Agenda 21, and the UK government’s so-called‘bedroom tax’, when benefits are cut back if you have a spare bedroom, is partof the process of forcing people into a smaller and smaller living space underAgenda 21. I’ll come to that part of the plan later. Labour Party employmentspokesman Stephen Timms said: ‘It is becoming increasingly evident that haplessministers haven’t got the first idea what is going to happen when their changescome in or how much hardship will be caused.’ Oh but they do, they do, and theirhidden masters know even more. Herding the masses into high-rise, high-density‘human settlement zones’ and confiscating the land goes hand-in-glove with thecontrol of water and every aspect of the food chain. You want to eat? You wantyour children to eat? Then do as we say, go where we say, or go hungry. The landand resources are being hijacked around the world, most obviously in the Middleand Near East, with United States, Britain and NATO aircraft and troops bombingtarget populations into submission. Another method is to get countries intoterrible economic straits by manipulating them into un-repayable debt and thenoffering them a deal to hand over rights to land and resources as payment forthe debt of non-existent ‘credit’. This is what the so-called ‘Third World Debt’crisis was all about. I have explained the background at length in ... And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. In summary, the Archon bloodlines arranged for afantastic hike in oil prices in the 1970s via the corrupt and onboard fakeroyals of Saudi Arabia and others in the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC). This caused increases in prices for everything across theworld economy (see ‘price shocks’ again), loss of jobs and livelihoods. Edward‘Black Eyes’ Heath, the British Prime Minister, introduced a three-day workingweek to ‘conserve fuel’. It was just another manufactured crisis in the Archonassault on humanity. The public excuse that the OPEC countries gave for hikingthe price of oil so high was America’s support for Israel in the 1973Arab-Israeli war, but it was announced and agreed at the Bilderberg Groupmeeting in May, 1973, at the Swedish island resort of Saltsjöbaden which isowned by the Rothschild Zionist Wallenberg banking family known as the ‘SwedishRothschilds’. The conference was chaired by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands,the German former member of the Nazi SS. Walter Levy (Rothschild Zionist), aGerman-born American oil consultant, laid out the plan for a 400 percentincrease in oil prices and how the imminent flood of petrodollars would beprocessed. When Levy died, aged 86 in 1997, the Chicago Tribune said: ‘Mr Levywas respected for his integrity, rectitude and trust.’[../Images/00091.jpg]Figure 677: Rothschild Zionist placeman Obama and the devastation in his wake.Five months after the Bilderberg Group meeting came the Arab-Israeli warorchestrated through the ‘shuttle diplomacy’ of US Secretary of State HenryKissinger (German-born Rothschild Zionist) and this provided the excuse for thelong-planned oil price hike. A covert agreement was made with Saudi Arabia andOPEC that the subsequent flood of petrodollars would, to use Kissinger’sdescription, be ‘recycled’ through designated Western banks. This presented themwith extraordinary inflows of money and their agents were dispatched across the‘Third World’ to lend governments, often corrupt dictators, as much money asthey wanted at variable interest rates. These interest rates were low to startwith, but then, as planned, in came Ronald Reagan and Father George Bush in theUnited States and Margaret Thatcher in Britain. Their identical economicpolicies known as Reaganomics and Thatcherism triggered big rises in interestrates and now the trap was sprung. The target countries were faced with debtthey could not possibly repay, often because the ‘loans’ went largely into thepockets of corrupt El-ites in the way the lending banks intended. Catastropheand untold death and suffering followed for the people of those countries andalong came the Archontic corporations to buy up the land and resources at centson the dollar. Often even this was not needed because of a criminal operationcalled ‘debt-for-nature swaps’ and debt for land and resources swaps.‘Debt-for-nature’ was the idea of Thomas Lovejoy, one-time director of theconservation programme at the Prince Philip and Prince Bernhard World WildlifeFund (US). These various swaps forgive some debt (often very little) in returnfor land and resources. This land-for-debt swap structure started out as theWorld Conservation Bank (WCB) which was proposed by the Rothschilds andRockefellers at the Fourth World Wilderness Conference in Colorado in 1987. Thisinvolved deleting some Third World debt in return for handing over wildernessand ‘environmentally sensitive’ lands to the ‘bank’. The plan was supported byattendees Edmond de Rothschild, David Rockefeller and James Baker, Secretary ofState to Father George Bush. You know – all those guys who care about theenvironment and the oppressed and starving peoples of the world. It was simply aruse to seize control of great swathes of land for Agenda 21 which at that timehad not even been mentioned publicly. George W Hunt, an accountant andinvestment consultant, was an official host of the World Wilderness Conferenceand he was better informed than most because he had been researching the globalconspiracy. Hunt revealed that the World Conservation Bank was designed to stealland while claiming that it was being done to reduce debt and ‘help theenvironment’. He said:> ... the banker Edmond de Rothschild was at the meeting for six days. Edmond de> Rothschild was personally conducting the monetary matters and creation of this> World Conservation Bank, in the company of Michael Sweatman of the Royal Bank> of Canada. Those two were like Siamese twins, and that’s why I say that it> appears they were running at least the money side of this conference and I> would say the conference was primarily to get money. Also, David Rockefeller> (of Chase Manhattan Bank) was there and gave a speech on Sunday ...Hunt was warned by Rockefeller’s office that he had ‘better stay out ofpoliticking’ or ‘he’d regret it’ when he challenged the plan in a writtenprotest delivered through David Rockefeller’s bodyguard. The plan proposed thatland from the indebted countries be transferred to the ownership of theRothschild-Rockefeller World Conservation Bank and that any organisation thattook over the bank would inherit ownership of the land. A fact sheet from theSecretariat of the Wilderness Conference said:> ... plans for the WCB propose that it act as an intermediary between certain> developing countries and multilateral or private banks to transfer a specific> debt to the WCB, thus substituting an existing ‘doubtful debt’ in the bank’s> books for a new loan to the WCB. In return for having been relieved of its> debt obligation, the debtor country would transfer to the WCB natural resource> assets of ‘equivalent value’.The World Conservation Bank morphed into the Global Environment Facility (GEF)and this is doing precisely what Rothschild and Rockefeller proposed by stealingthe land for Agenda 21. The current chair of the Scientific Technical AdvisoryPanel for the Global Environment Facility is Thomas Lovejoy, originator ofdebt-for-nature swaps. Archon corporations are also land-grabbing throughout thedeveloping (inversion) world by buying and leasing farmland in Africa, SouthAmerica, Asia and Eastern Europe. About a third of farmland in the Ukraine isnow foreign-owned, about half in the Philippines and 100 percent in Liberia. Theland is then covered with mono-crops for export and control of the globalfood-chain continues apace. A report by the Fairtrade Foundation said that threecorporations now control more than 40 percent of global coffee sales; eightdictate the supply of cocoa and chocolate; seven control 85 percent of teaproduction; five account for 75 percent of the world banana trade, and thelargest six sugar traders control about two-thirds of the world market. Thereport said that smallholders are ‘seriously under threat’ and that themanipulations of the market were leaving them ‘condemned to poverty’. Fairtradesaid it was vital ‘to put the politics of food on the public agenda and findbetter solutions to the insanity of our broken food system’. But this is whatpeople miss – even most of those with good intentions. The system seems broken,but it’s not. It is meant to be this way. It only seems to be broken because ofits effects on people and planet and the belief that no one could be that evilto be doing this on purpose – but they could and they are.The land-grab comes homeVast numbers of people have been removed from the land in the name of protectingthe environment and the same is now happening in the developed (for now) world.The localised structure of Agenda 21 hides the global coordination and it isbeing covertly managed and advanced through the global secret society andsatanic networks and their agents in city and other local government; by paidmanipulators posing as local activists; and by naïve ‘Greens’ on whom a symphonyis being played while they think they are saving the world. I am so glad that Ispent some years in the 1980s in the Green Party because I saw how thismentality thinks and it has been so useful in understanding what is happeningnow, with ‘the environment’ at the very forefront of imposing a globalfascist/communist state. One of the ‘Greens’ that I met was a guy calledJonathan Porritt, another population extremist, who was a Green Party spokesmanand is now a patron of Population Matters, (formerly the Optimum PopulationTrust), president of a sustainable development charity and environmental advisorto Prince Charles. Porritt’s got the set. The coordination of Agenda 21 throughAmerica’s one-party state can be seen in the fact that President Father GeorgeBush (‘Republican’) signed up for Agenda 21; President Bill Clinton (Democrat)expanded its reach by establishing The President’s Counsel for ‘SustainableDevelopment’ by another no-debate Executive Order; and alleged president, Barack‘where’s the birth certificate?’ Obama employed the Executive Order ruse tointroduce the ‘White House Rural Council’ in 2011 (Fig 678). These are theagencies represented on the Obama ‘Rural Council’:[../Images/00374.jpg]Figure 678: Obama’s ‘Rural Council’ is a vehicle to remove the masses from theland.> Secretary of Agriculture; Department of the Treasury; Department of Defense;> Department of Justice; Department of Interior; Department of Commerce;> Department of Labor; Department of Health and Human Services; Department of> Housing and Urban Development; Department of Transportation; Department of> Energy; Department of Education; Department of Veterans Affairs; Department of> Homeland Security; Environmental Protection Agency; Federal Communications> Commission; Mississippi Delta Regional Authority; Appalachian Regional> Commission; Corporation for National and Community Service; Office of> Management and Budget; Office of Science and Technology Policy; Office of> National Drug Control Policy; Council of Economic Advisers; Domestic Policy> Council; National Economic Council; Small Business Administration; Council on> Environmental Quality; White House Office of Public Engagement and> Intergovernmental Affairs; White House Office of Cabinet Affairs; and ‘such> other executive branch departments, agencies, and offices as the President or> the Secretary of Agriculture may, from time to time, designate’.The Department of Defense? On a ‘Rural Council’ supposedly dedicated to‘increasing the flow of capital to rural areas, job creation, and workforcedevelopment, expansion of telecommunications, renewable energy and new marketsfor rural communities, increased access to quality health care, education, andhousing, and particularly in persistent poverty counties and tribal areas’? Whatwe are looking at are all the agencies, bodies and law enforcement needed forthe imposition of Agenda 21. The code-speak comes in statements like the need to‘streamline and improve the effectiveness of Federal programs serving ruralAmerica ... through smarter government we can do even more to improve outcomesand lower costs for the American taxpayer’. The words ‘smart’ and ‘smarter’ areprogram-terms constantly used with regard to Agenda 21. Among the implicationsis that you are smart if you support what it proposes and stupid of you don’t.‘Smart-growth’ is another catch-phrase along with ‘high density urban mixed usedevelopment’ (Agenda 21 ‘human settlement zones’). The White House Rural Councilwebsite talks about conservation, the expansion of outdoor opportunities andeconomic growth when, through Archontic inversion, conservation meansconfiscation; the expansion of outdoor opportunities means people thrown ontothe street; and economic growth means economic annihilation. Obama’s ExecutiveOrder has been described as ‘the greatest threat to independent and familyfarming and ranching’ – and so it is. Another commentator said it was ‘a warcouncil and one which has declared its intention to mount an attack on propertyowners across the nation ... to remove as many as possible from valuedagricultural lands across the country’. Spot on. Remember that the end ofprivate property ownership (except for the El-lite) is a key goal of Agenda 21and was listed by Dr Richard Day in 1969. The United States Department ofAgriculture (USDA) is a major vehicle for the implementation of Agenda 21 bydriving people from the land: look how much of America the government alreadyclaims to own (Fig 679). David Ferrell, the department’s director of law andenforcement investigations, attended an International Network for EnvironmentalCompliance and Enforcement (INECE) where ‘environmental compliance andenforcement experts from over 50 countries gathered to identify new actions topromote enforcement cooperation to ... support the shift to sustainabledevelopment’. The Environmental Compliance and Enforcement website, clearlywritten by an android, says:[../Images/00424.jpg]Figure 679: Look at how much land the US government already owns (the darkareas), especially in the west, and this is only the Federal government and doesnot include all the state-owned land.> Agenda 21: An international mandate for building compliance and enforcement> capacity as an essential element of environmental management ...

The EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) is not there to protect the environment, but to hassleand terrorise people in rural communities to leave their homes and land byimposing draconian laws and making up others whenever they need them. Obamaissued a nodebate, swish-of-the-pen-law-of-the-land Executive Order on March 16,2012, headed ‘National Defense Resources Preparedness’ which allows thegovernment to ‘legally’ seize all land, farms (including all livestock andcrops), property, industry and business, food production and distribution,health resources, energy and water sources, and transportation, among much else.All this fascist ‘law’ (legal document) requires to be activated is a governmentclaim that it is necessary to ‘promote national defense’ which could apply toalmost anything. This is what they are planning to speed the introduction ofAgenda 21. As part of this the US Department of Agriculture has launched a‘census of agriculture’ to register and record in very fine detail assets of allAmerican farms. The accounts of EPA fascism are now legion and increasing by theday. It hides behind claims that it only exists to stop pollution of the air,water and environment in general, but its brief is to drive people off the landwith outrageous laws and regulations that are both outrageous in themselves andeven more so in their enforcement. One EPA Region 6 Administrator called AlArmendariz encapsulated the EPA’s approach and methods when he said:> The Romans used to conquer the villages in the Mediterranean. They’d go into a> little Turkish town somewhere, they’d find the first five guys they saw, and> they would crucify them. And then, you know, that town was really easy to> manage for the next few years.Armendariz was forced to apologise after his words were made public byRepublican Representative John Fleming who rightly said: ‘This is enviro-fascismat its worst, and if someone needs to be made an example of, it’s this EPAofficial who disregarded science and facts to randomly and negligently pursuethe Obama administration’s war on energy.’ It is in fact a war on freedom withenergy as just one weapon in the armoury. Armendariz was describing the brief ofthe EPA in imposing Agenda 21 and it has already driven streams of residents andfarmers from their land, destroyed their businesses and sent people to jail onextraordinary pretexts. The agency boasts on the ‘Compliance and Enforcement’section of its website about the scale of fines inflicted and ‘years ofincarceration’ it has secured for its targets. Christine Todd Whitman, theadministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Boy Bush, had the lawchanged to remove the requirement that the government agencies had to take thepoor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes toenvironmental legislation. This was all in preparation for Agenda 21. The sameChristine Todd Whitman repeatedly said after 9/11 that toxins in the Ground Zeroarea posed no threat to health – ‘The concentrations are such that they don’tpose a health hazard ... We’re going to make sure everybody is safe.’ Yes, sosafe that scores of rescue workers at the scene have since died or are dyinghorrible and painful deaths from the effects of what was breathed in (Figs 680and 681). These people don’t give a shit. They devastate farming communities byimposing the fine detail of fascist laws and yet when faced with a realenvironmental disaster like Fukushima they just increase the alleged ‘safelevels’ of radiation (see Whitman and 9/11) and say everything is fine. As Iwrite, the EPA is seeking to take control of all ditches, gullies and evenbriefly existing water sources (formed immediately after rain or melting snowfor example). They are doing this by defining them under the Clean Water Act as‘waterways’. Controlling their use would be fatal for small farmers and growers,but then that’s the idea. When I say the plan is to control all water, I meanall water; and control of gullies and ditches means control of whether a farmsurvives or not. Don’t touch that puddle, it’s government property. The Agenda21 plan for the takeover of all global water supplies is being coordinatedthrough organisations including the Global Water Partnership, World WaterCouncil and others under the heading of ‘integrated’ (centrally-controlled)water resources management (IWRM). People who are fined and jailed forcollecting rainwater are targets of this incessant demand for total control ofwater. Gary Harrington from Oregon was jailed for 30 days and fined $1,500 forcollecting rainwater and snow runoff on his own land while people in Marylandare being taxed for anything that stops rain going into the ground. The state ofOregon claims to own all water sources and more and more states are doing thesame. Officials use the term that all water is ‘publicly-owned’ which isOrwellian-speak for owned by those that own the state. Tom Paul, administratorof the Oregon Water Resources Department and described in one report of thestory as an ‘obedient water Nazi’, said: ‘Oregon law says that all of the waterin the state of Oregon is public water and if you want to use that water, eitherto divert it or to store it, you have to acquire a water right from the state ofOregon before doing that activity.’ Some politicians accused the Obamaadministration and its agencies of ‘ignoring law and rulemaking procedures inorder to tighten their regulatory grip over every water body in the country’.Yes, just as demanded by Agenda 21. Control the allocation of water and youcontrol the people who need water to survive. Rosa Koire, author of Behind theGreen Mask: U.N. Agenda 21, says that around a thousand dams have been destroyedso far in the United States to remove water sources on which farmers depended.This is not nationally reported, mostly not even locally reported, and withoutnational coverage the overall pattern cannot be seen except in books like thisone and through alternative radio shows.[../Images/00290.jpg]Figure 680: The first responders on 9/11 – now left to suffer and die.[../Images/00356.jpg]Figure 681: Christine Todd Whitman: ‘The concentrations are such that they don’tpose a health hazard ... We’re going to make sure everybody is safe.’ Wellthat’s okay, then.Zonal zoning zone zonesEvery effort and excuse possible is being used to clear the land for ‘wildlifezones’, ‘buffer zones’ and any other version of no-people zones; but when landis taken from the public and individuals at knockdown prices under compulsorypurchase, it is often being passed on to corporations for development to thedetriment and elimination of the wildlife and flora and fauna that the takeoverwas claimed to be protecting. Corporations are being given prime locations,parks and roads paid for by the people through taxation to turn them intomoney-making operations such as toll roads. Who controls the corporations? TheArchontic bloodlines. Farm prices are being suppressed to drive farmers andgrowers out of business and a continuing stream of new laws and regulations aredesigned to make small farming and growing impossible. Fauquier County, or moreaccurately Fuck-you County, in Virginia threatened Martha Boneta via ‘ZoningAdministrator’ Kimberly Johnson with thousands of dollars in fines for having abirthday party for a ten-year-old on her small farm without getting theirpermission. This sums up the world of Agenda 21 in a single sentence. A partyfor a friend’s daughter constituted an illegal ‘event’ in the minds of theseclinically insane people that are being specifically recruited by otherclinically-insane people. They also prosecuted her for selling produce directlyto the public without a licence. They pulled the common Agenda 21 trick ofchanging the regulations after she had already secured a county-approvedbusiness license for a ‘retail farm shop’ and with another swish of the pen whathad been legal becomes illegal. These people and their like around the worldhave no idea how truly evil, heartless and stupid they are because they arementally ill. The common theme of all of this is to make it impossible forindependent farmers and growers to survive. One of the supporters of MarthaBoneta said: ‘It is becoming very difficult for small and mid-size farmers tocompete and survive and thrive, in this kind of environment.’ Exactly, and thatis why it is being done. A bill to change the law and give more freedom tofarmers was introduced in response to Martha Boneta’s case, but what becameknown as the Boneta Bill was heavily defeated by the Agenda 21 groupies on aVirginia Senate committee. The US Department of Transportation said in 2011 thatit was proposing to require farmers to have a commercial driver’s license tooperate farming equipment – another calculated move to advance Agenda 21. Familyfarms survive by members of the family driving the tractors and other on-farmvehicles as they have for generations and they cannot afford to employprofessional drivers on the tight budgets they already have to live with.Millions of independent farmers and growers all over the world are being forcedfrom the land and out of business because prices and laws make it impossible tocontinue and the Archontic corporations move in to take over for Agenda 21.Meanwhile, the Archon agriculture giants and parasites like billionairefinancial speculator George Soros are buying up the land at a fantastic rate asit becomes vacant. Author Rosa Koire, whom I mentioned earlier, is a co-founderof the Santa Rosa Neighborhood Coalition, Democrats Against UN Agenda 21, andthe Post Sustainability Institute. She has described how Agenda 21 is removingpeople from their land by authorities refusing to pave rural roads andpulverising most of those that already are. She says that in Sonoma County(which includes Bohemian Grove) the authorities have announced that only 150 outof 1,380 miles of rural road are going to be left paved and the rest pulverisedto gravel. The excuse is a lack of money – another benefit of the engineeredeconomic crash. A resident of Blanding, Utah said that his family had beenhunting in the area since his dad was a kid but now ‘it seems like they haveclosed a thousand roads’. This is happening everywhere, often in contraventionof the law, but that means nothing any longer. The consequences are that peopleare not able to get to and from their rural homes, property prices collapse andthey are forced into the cities and kept under surveillance as per Agenda 21.Paved roads are among a long list of human activities that are considered‘unsustainable’ and must be eliminated. These include, but only include, the useof farmland and pastures, grazing animals, irrigation, golf courses, ski lodgesand the family unit. That is a diverse list to give a feel of the whole spectrumof human life that Agenda 21 is targeting. There are rural ghost towns acrossAmerica which once survived as food and drink stops for freeway traffic that arenow destroyed since the authorities removed the freeway exits on which theydepended. New exits have been introduced instead well away from ruralcommunities and are occupied by the corporations behind McDonalds, Burger Kingand all the other purveyors of body-mugging processed shite which a YaleUniversity and Germany study connected to a sharp increase in autoimmunediseases such as multiple sclerosis, alopecia, asthma and eczema. They get toput their poison factories wherever they like while officials are turning up inrural communities and offering insultingly low prices for their propertieslocated in designated no-people areas. If the homeowner or farmer or grower doesnot accept the price, or doesn’t want to leave at any price, they are taken tocourt to have their property seized and then sent the bill for legal and courtcosts. This process of the state stealing private property is called eminentdomain in the United States and compulsory purchase (mostly compulsory theft) inthe UK. All this is not going to happen – it is happening and the ignorant,gutless and testicle-free media stays silent about it.The plight of homeowners in the sparsely-populated Antelope Valley in a desertregion on the outskirts of Los Angeles County, California, is anotherin-your-face example of Agenda 21 terrorism to clear the land of people. Theoften colourful characters that lived here have been viciously targeted by‘Nuisance Abatement Teams’ which as usual in the United States are armed. Theirbrief is to police ‘zoning and code violations’. America is drowning inuniforms, laws, codes, regulations and ‘violations’ and it’s the same in Britainand other countries, too. It seems to me that most violations (‘the act ofviolating or the condition of being violated’) are the violations of the armedand uniformed goonatics whose numbers expand by the day as if multiplying in acell culture through the hours of darkness. Hey, there’s three of those luminousjackets this morning ... there was only one here yesterday ... and they all looklike identical twins, don’t they? What’s going on? Armed Nuisance AbatementTeams clearly from the cabbage patch have been targeting homeowners in theAntelope Valley for doing nothing more than quietly getting on with their lives.One of the few examples of this state terrorism to be reported was the case ofKim Fahey and his home known as ‘Phonehenge’ because it was built by Fahey ondesert land from old telegraph poles (Fig 682). The Nuisance Abatement goonaticscharged Fahey with twelve ‘misdemeanours’ and he was jailed and forced todemolish his home. Many others have lost their homes in the same way and thesewere people already living on next to nothing. Joey Gallow, a retired Armyveteran, was another target. Remember this, anyone in the military who thinksthey are serving their country and that their country cares for them. Gallowsaid that the government thugs first turned up to tell him to cut back bushesand he told them, okay, no problem. Then they told him to move a shed and getrid of his motor home, both of which he did. This was only leading in onedirection and eventually they told him he had to get off the property. They saidthat neighbours (the next house is half a mile away) had complained aboutunsightly structures. The thugs wouldn’t say who had complained, only that hehad to leave. Gallow said:[../Images/00264.jpg]Figure 682: Kim Fahey was harming no one, but the Archontic fascists wanted hisland.> I looked at them and said ‘for why? My closest neighbour is a half a mile> away, we are not living in Beverley Hills here, this is my home’. All of a> sudden I have got police at my front door with bullet proof vests, guns and> they surrounded the place. Everything I worked for was just melting away from> me. I don’t know where I am going to go, I really don’t.Welcome to the vicious and brutal world of Agenda 21 as they clear the land ofhumans. Mechanic Oscar Castaneda is another Antelope Valley resident ordered todestroy his home. Castaneda owned the property where the movies Kill Bill 1 and2 were shot. Castaneda and his wife grew their own food, took water from theirown well and produced their own power from solar panels. This was the very‘sustainable’ lifestyle that Agenda 21, if it was genuine, would be applauding;but it’s not genuine. It is an excuse for global control and so Castaneda andhis wife had to go. The goons visited multiple times and entered without awarrant, taking pictures and saying that he was in violation because of too manyvehicles (he’s a mechanic) and what they claimed was an ‘improper water tank’.They said that these were a danger to neighbours when there were no neighboursfor ten miles. It was yet another case of ...> ‘Officer Idiot and Officer Moron, Supervisor Tosspot has just been on the> phone – get out there and find a reason to get these people off their land..’> ‘Duh, er, duh, yessir, Sergeant Nobhead. Can we shoot ‘em?’> ‘Not this time boys.’> ‘Awwwww.’Oscar Castaneda was told that he could stay on his property only if he drillednew water holes and connected to the county power grid. What happened to‘sustainability’? The cost for this? Between $75,000 and $100,000 and thosebehind this state terrorism would have well known that. Mars Melnacov, areporter from LA Weekly, said: ‘They are picking on the people who are the mostdefenceless and have the least resources and also [are] unknowledgeable abouttheir rights.’ Other residents told of their own experiences of this stateharassment and intimidation:> • ‘They had black jackets on, side arms, Taser guns, M16s, paintball guns.’> • ‘I lost $2,500 of income because they said that my mobile homes were> illegal.’> • ‘This is intimidation, this is domestic terrorists, this is trespassing ...’> • ‘They said that we have to get rid of everything we have. They pointed to> the dirt and said “See that ground right there, we want your whole place to> look like that.’Republican Michael Antonovich, the senior member of the LA County Board ofSupervisors, was the man who established the fascist Nuisance Abatement Teams,but refuses to comment when questioned on their terrorist behaviour. Antonovichis in his 70s and yet still wants to use intimidation to make people homeless.What can you possibly make of a mind like that except that here is anotherexample of what happens when your empathy is deleted? These people think theycan get away with all this but one day the lights go out and come back on inanother reality. Only then do they realise that there is no escapingconsequences for actions because when this short experience is over they willgravitate to the frequencies that are in sync with their energy field. All thebest with that one. Some US states are hitting back against the tyranny andpassing laws to protect private property and banning or condemning Agenda 21.These include Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee and many more would follow if thepublic realised what is planned and what Agenda 21 really means.Weaponised weatherThe Army Corps of Engineers flooded great tracts of land owned by family farmersand growers when they said it was necessary to blow some levees in 2011 with theMissouri and Mississippi rivers said to be at dangerous levels. The farms weredestroyed, at least in the shorter-term, and three weeks later the farmers weresent letters offering to buy their land via ... the Army Corps of Engineers. Theblowing of the levees is an example of another weapon being used to destroysmall and independent farming, growing and rural communities in general (Figs683 and 684). Dr Richard Day, the Rockefeller insider and weather manipulationoperative during World War II, said in 1969: ‘The weather will be modified andused as a weapon of war to create drought or famine.’ Producing record-breakingsnow in the mountains and constant heavy rains to flood the Missouri andMississippi is easy for the technology at the Archon bloodlines’ disposal –especially HAARP, the weather-manipulating technology in Alaska that bounceshigh-power radio waves off the upper atmosphere and back to earth. I will talkabout this later on, but it’s real and happening on a gathering scale as moretechnology becomes available. Weather-modification has been going on since atleast the first half of the 20th century and has become a frontline weapon infaking the effects of ‘climate change’, imposing ‘natural disasters’ in pursuitof a specific outcome (such as destroying independent farmers and growers) andin warfare to a target country and bring it to its knees. A BBC radiodocumentary in 2001 revealed how the British Royal Air Force was engaged inrain-making cloud-seeding experiments in the skies over North Devon in 1952immediately before the area experienced 250 times the normal rainfall and 90million tonnes of water cascaded down a gorge to devastate the coastal villageof Lynmouth destroying buildings and killing 35 people (Fig 685). Survivors toldhow the smell of sulphur filled the air the afternoon of the flood. (Rememberthe Bill Gates sulphur ‘experiment’?) The RAF called the weather-changingexperiment ‘Operation Cumulus’ and it was also known by those involved as‘Operation Witch Doctor’. One resident, Dilys Singleton, lost six members of herfamily, including her grandmother who was identified by a wart on her backbecause she was found with no head, arms or legs. Did the RAF face anyconsequences for creating such horrors? No, the operation was classified andeven those documents eventually went missing. The truth had to be put togetherfrom RAF logbooks and personal testimony of what happened more than 60 yearsago. A US military operation began in Vietnam in 1967 called Project Popeyewhich extended the monsoon season for military objectives and such things havebecome commonplace today. Not only America but Russia, China and probably othershave also developed weather-changing technology. Authorities in Moscow announcedin 2013 that they were spending $4 million on weather manipulation to ensurecloudless skies on two national holidays using cloud dispersing and seedingmethods that go back to the Soviet era. A US Air Force document, AF 2025 FinalReport, says that weather modification ‘offers the war fighter a wide range ofpossible options to defeat or coerce an adversary’. These included theartificial creation floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes. It goes on:[../Images/00225.jpg]Figure 683: Family farms after the levees were blown.[../Images/00107.jpg]Figure 684: Independent farms are being targeted from every angle.[../Images/00282.jpg]Figure 685: Lynmouth after the cloud-seeding experiment.> US aerospace forces [will] ‘own the weather’ by capitalizing on emerging> technologies and focusing development of those technologies to warfighting> applications ...

All this collectively had a dramatic effect on foodproduction and farmer incomes. Thousands of record temperatures were matched orbroken in a single week in the United States at one point and this was happeningat a crucial time of the year for corn pollination. One report told how manyAmerican corn farmers were ‘on the brink of total disaster’ and financial ruin –exactly as planned. More than half of all American counties – 1,584 in 32 states– had been designated primary disaster areas by August 2012 and corn farmerswere reported to be abandoning areas of land bigger than Belgium and Luxembourg(Fig 687). But while the drought continued and groundwater supplies diminishedthe Archon energy corporations were still allowed to continue with their insanepolicy of ‘fracking’ which involves drilling and injecting fluid (water mixedwith sand and chemicals) at a high pressure to fracture shale rocks and releaseoil and natural gas. This is causing extreme environmental damage and pollutingdrinking water. The plan is to poison the population through drinking water andthis includes the pollution of groundwater with pesticides and other toxins.Fracking also diverts away tremendous volumes of water needed for producingfood. Each fracking operation consumes between one and eight million gallons ofwater mixed with some 40,000 gallons of around 600 chemicals that include lead,uranium, mercury, ethylene glycol, radium, methanol, hydrochloric acid andformaldehyde. This leaks into ground water sources and the fracturing alsoreleases methane which is 17 times higher than normal in drinking-water wellsnear fracking sites. Methane is a greenhouse gas – so much for being concernedabout global warming. The website dangersoffracking.com publishes the followingmaths: 500,000 active gas wells in the United States x 8 million gallons ofwater per fracking x 18 times that a well can be fracked = 72 trillion gallonsof water and 360 billion gallons of chemicals required for current gas wells inthe US alone and this is happening worldwide. All this was allowed to continueduring the drought and the reason why leads us to another equation: thebloodlines own the corporations x the bloodlines own the governments = we dowhat we fracking like; and: taking the water away from farmers and the public xcontrolling all water supplies and sources = if you want some water essential tolife you have to do whatever we say. The American government officially agreesthat fracking can cause earthquakes, so does the science community and even someof the companies involved, and this is on top of all the water use andcontamination, but sources close to British Energy and Climate Change SecretaryEd Davey – yes, Ed’s back – said that he was ‘quite excited’ about it happeningacross Britain. Fracking also releases into the atmosphere deadly radioactiveradon gas which mixes with fracking gases used in the home and workplaces and isthe biggest cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. Western and Chinese mining andother companies are forcing native peoples from their lands all over the worldthrough violence, intimidation and by draining their resources, especiallyaccess to water. This is happening even in Ecuador where President Rafael Correamay cultivate a man-of-thepeople, anti-global establishment image, but he isopening the country to mega-mining corporations and suppressing dissent withstate security forces.[../Images/00103.jpg]Figure 687: Livelihoods were destroyed and food prices soared.Starve them to submissionThe US Department of Agriculture forecast record-breaking price rises as aresult of the extreme weather – I would say engineered extreme weather. Cornstockpiles fell dramatically and the cost rose by more than half and with 75percent of American foodstuffs containing corn the food price increases becamewidespread. Food corporations such as Kraft, Tyson and Nestlé said they wouldpass on the increased costs to the public, but then they always do. GoodmanSachs, Barclays and other banks made a lot of money betting on the price of foodand Chris Mahoney, the trader’s director of agricultural products atagribusiness giant Glencore, who owns some £500 million in company shares, tolda conference call that the devastating drought would be ‘good for Glencore’ asit exploited soaring prices. These people have no heart and no soul.Spiritually, they are dead people walking. Remember what the Swiss clairvoyant,Anton Styger, said:> When I see people in business or politics who are particularly trapped by the> material world, for example, I notice that they no longer have any light> bodies at all. In many of these people, the point of light at the heart> chakra, which is otherwise always present, is no longer visible to me.> Instead, I see something like a layer of ‘shiny tar’ around them in which a> monstrous being in the shape of a lizard can be distinguished. When such> people speak on television, for example, I see a crocodile shape manifesting> itself around the person like in a concave mirror; I don’t see the light of> their throat and forehead chakra.The US weather disaster posed deadly potential consequences for the people ofimport-dependent countries across Asia, the Middle East, Africa and theCaribbean. Something like a third of the world’s staple grains are produced inthe American Midwest. The increased cost of animal feed increased the price ofmeat and milk. This is another major aspect of the Agenda 21 war on humanity –making food scarce and expensive to cause hunger and demanding obedience inreturn for a meagre supply of food. Famine in the West? Yes, this is preciselywhat they are planning. Farmers and growers independent of the Archoncorporations are being targeted all over the world in pursuit of Agenda 21 andthis is why in Britain the prices paid to farmers are being squeezed by theArchon supermarket chains which, together with other techniques, has driven tensof thousands from the land. The Cameron government announced as soon as it cameto power in 2010 that it proposed to sell off all the state forests into privatehands (read corporations). The public were taken aback at the plan which wasnever mentioned in Cameron’s election campaign. This, too, was to advance Agenda21, as Cameron, the conman, liar and cheat, well knew. There was no rhyme orreason to it except for Agenda 21 which has control of all forests on its listof global acquisitions. Cameron’s plan now will be to sell off the forestsone-by-one so that he only faces local opposition in each case instead of thewhole country. This sleazy man was trying to do what most political leaders doimmediately they come to power – get through highlyunpopular policiesimmediately in the honeymoon period. This time the plan failed in the face ofconcerted public opposition, but he’ll be seeking to sell those forests in anyway he can because it’s his job. ‘Green’ groups in the UK who can’t find amicrophone quick enough to spout on about ‘climate change’ played virtually nopart in this save-the-forests campaign because they are now tools of Agenda 21and often infiltrated to that very end. They are now the poodle not the guarddog with regards to environmental policy. Cameron’s plan for his ‘Big Society’is also code for Agenda 21 which includes compulsory ‘voluntary’ work. Isn’tthat an oxymoron? Yes he is, but somehow he became prime minister. The Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation has been funding the acquisition of farmland in Africain the name of helping local farmers. Ahhhh, how nice.You need that to survive? Well, you can’t have it thenAgenda 21 has gone so far in states like Michigan that the Department of NaturalResources (DNR) has decided that only certain species of pigs are allowed – theones in corporation factory farms – and any others must be destroyed or thefarmers will arrested and jailed. The same is happening in Canada, most notablywith rare breeds of sheep. These farmers, of course, are the family variety thatAgenda 21 seeks to destroy. One minute these farmers are going about theirbusiness quite legally and the next they are being threatened with arrest whiletheir pigs, sheep and livelihoods are deleted (Fig 688). There is nojustification for any of this. They just need an excuse to advance Agenda 21 andso they make one up. You can see why they have had to spend so longsystematically recruiting narcissistic, psychopathic sociopaths to do this dirtywork. How could you do this to decent people if you had any capacity forempathy? One farmer shot all his pigs including piglets when he knew thefascists from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources were on the way toarrest him if they were still alive. His lawyer, Joseph O’Leary, said:[../Images/00171.jpg]Figure 688: Any excuse and we’re coming for you.> It was very traumatic for him. These guys are farmers, and I know how much he> cared for the animals there, and the DNR treats these like they’re some kind> of a plant that needs to be exterminated rather than animals that people care> about.No empathy, no compassion – narcissistic, psychopathic sociopaths. A major partof this systematic cull of rare breeds is the same as the destruction of seeddiversity. Rare breeds that have not been genetically-modified cannot be ownedby the corporations. Montana Jones from the Wholearth Farmstudio in Canada hadher very rare Shropshire sheep slaughtered by the thugs of the government’s FoodInspection Agency (CFIA) on the unconfirmed allegation that they may have hadthe disease scrapie. Once they were dead it turned out that they didn’t. This isbecoming a common ruse to systematically destroy diversity. Montana revealed howfar the killing campaign has now gone:> In the past 15 years, 190 breeds of farm animals have gone extinct worldwide,> and there are currently 1,500 others at risk of being wiped out. Within the> last ten years alone, 60 breeds of cattle, goats, pigs, horses and poultry> have become extinct.To speed the destruction of small farms the Environmental Protection Agency hasimposed further rules, regulations and taxation on farting livestock becausemethane is a greenhouse gas. No, this is not the Twilight Zone. Well, it is, butnot officially. A large permit fee is payable for animals that emit 100 tons ofgreenhouse gases a year. How do they check? It seems like this would require arather large staff working in shifts 24 hours. This comedy club nonsense isaffecting the great majority of livestock operations in the United States, butthe difference is that those owned by the corporations can afford it and thesmaller farms cannot. Note, too, that the methane released through fracking isnever mentioned by these same people. The New York Farm Bureau estimated thatthe new permits would cost farmers in excess of $110 million a year. Politicalstrategist Mike Baker was correct in all but one sense when he said:> The Obama Administration and the EPA officials fail to understand how> important family farms are to our upstate rural communities. I don’t support> any tax that hurts farms and I am appalled with this permit requirement which> could shut down our agricultural sector, causing catastrophic consequences for> the American economy. I would advise Americans to buy skis because we are in> the precipice of a very slippery slope. The federal government will now begin> to dictate what farmers may own and what they must do on their own property.This is all quite so except that the government and leading EPA officialsprecisely understand how important family farms are to rural communities andthis is why they are targeting the farms to destroy those communities and getthem off the land for Agenda 21. Chicken farmers are also being pulled into thisfor the same reason with new rules adding to their costs. I am all forprotecting the environment, but this is not what all this is about. Farmers havebeen told to grow biofuel but suddenly the European Union changed its policy andcapped production to cause more financial damage to farming families.Grow your own and go to jailDestroying small farms and growers has another benefit for Agenda 21 and that isthe complete control of the food chain from production to plate. There you havethe reason why people are increasingly targeted in the United States and Canadafor growing food in their own gardens and community gardens (Fig 689). City ofToronto Parks Director Richard Ubbens ordered the destruction of a communitygarden growing free food for the hungry and gave no warning or time for peopleto remove the rare plant species or harvest the food. Hundreds had been helpedby this initiative at a time of great economic hardship, but Ubbens and hiscolleagues on the paid-by-the-people payroll clearly don’t give a shit.Unbelievable. The vandalism was done on the eve of a Harvest Party for what wasknown as the People’s Pea Garden to celebrate the sharing, the sense ofcommunity and free food. Ever more people are seeking out food banks and charityto feed themselves and their families and it is only the heartless,empathydeleted Archontic sociopaths that could sanction actions like these.What’s more, supermarkets in the UK alone are throwing away an estimated £10billion worth of perfectly edible food every year because it doesn’t conform tothe ‘right’ shape or type. Tristram Stuart, author of Waste: Uncovering theGlobal Food Scandal, said: ‘I spent many years visiting the skips ofsupermarkets and literally, you open up a skip and what you see is an array ofperfectly good vegetables and fruit that have been thrown away.’ The otheraspect of what happened in Toronto is that those who physically destroyed thegarden on behalf of the state on Richard Ubbens’ say-so are people also paid apittance and struggling to pay their bills. But they dare not refuse to do whatthey are told in fear of losing their jobs when there are few otheropportunities. This is the whole idea and the system not only divides the havesand have-nots, but crucially the have-nots and have-very-littles. This has tostop because if it doesn’t the have-littles will themselves eventually becomethe have-nothing-at-alls. Where we are now is not where it is meant to stay andwe either come together now or it is going to get a whole lot worse and thensome. The law of cause-and-effect – or what you give out you get back – willalso return to haunt the Richard Ubbens of this world, too, of which there areabsolute legions worldwide. A state agency in Utah has opened a website forpeople to ‘register’ their vegetable gardens – even if a ‘garden’ means they aregrowing a tomato in a pot. The state says it wants to know how much food ‘we’are growing. The ‘we’ was in reference to ‘it’ – the state considers that thefood grown in thousands of individual gardens on private property is a resourceof the state. The real reason for the register is to locate the food-growinggardens they need to target. Another of the countless and constantly increasingexamples of this is the case of Josée Landry and partner Michel Beauchamp inDrummondville, Montreal, Canada, who began to grow food in their front gardenfor health and financial reasons. They provided not-for-profit food to thecommunity and attracted worldwide attention on the Internet. The garden was notan eyesore, but very tidy. The local authorities employed the usual ‘complaintsfrom neighbours’ excuse – neighbours that are never named. Drummondville CEOClaude Proulx said it was a question of ‘uniformity of the urban fabric’. No, itis a question of what on earth goes on in Proulx’s head. The attack on theprivate growing of food is Agenda 21 and it is expanding rapidly. The couplewere threatened with fines of hundreds of dollars a day for not complying withthis lunacy while others have been threatened with jail for growing front yardtomatoes or they come home to find their garden destroyed by the City Hallvandals. Elizabeth Renter of Natural Society wrote: ‘It seems like every month afew more stories hit the social media grapevines where home owners are beingpunished for growing food.’ Farmers and growers are also being faced with foodsafety laws that are intentionally designed to make their survival impossible.This is what Dr Richard Day said would happen when he spoke to thepaediatricians in 1969: ‘Growing food would be banned by saying it isn’t safeand the state and corporations would control all food production.’ Mike Adams ofNaturalnews.com wrote:[../Images/00419.jpg]Figure 689: People are hungry and the authorities destroy sources of food.> Drummondville officials are moving forward with a new ordinance that will> completely restrict front yard gardens altogether, no matter their size, which> puts Beauchamp and his wife and many others out of the food self-sufficiency> business.

Similar cases of> home-grown food destruction have taken place in Georgia, Michigan, and New> Jersey.This is exactly in line with Agenda 21. Then the unelected dark suits of the EUproposed news laws in May 2013 to make it illegal to grow, reproduce or tradeany vegetable seeds not tested, approved and accepted by the new Orwellian ‘EUPlant Variety Agency’ which would charge a fee for each registration – morepaying for your own prison. The ‘Plant Reproductive Material Law’ would makehome gardening with non-regulated seeds a criminal act. Ben Gabel, vegetablebreeder and director of The Real Seed Catalogue, said that the law would‘immediately stop the professional development of vegetable varieties for homegardeners, organic growers, and smallscale market farmers’. He went on:> All this new law does is create a whole new raft of EU civil servants being> paid to move mountains of papers round all day, while killing off the seed> supply to home gardeners and interfering with the right of farmers to grow> what they want.> It also very worrying that they have given themselves the power to regulate> and licence any plant species of any sort at all in the future – not just> agricultural plants, but grasses, mosses, flowers, anything at all – without> having to bring it back to the Council for a vote.This is all connected to the plan to ban the population from growing their ownfood, destroy seed diversity and allow the Archon food and biotech corporation amonopoly on the global food supply – ‘Growing food would be banned by saying itisn’t safe and the state and corporations would control all food production.’The global fascist/communist structure would decide what you ate and if you ate;and what you ate would be full of chemical cocktails beyond anything consumedtoday to control the masses mentally, emotionally and bodily. The water supplywould also be drugged so that, in the words of Brave New World author, AldousHuxley, people ‘loved their servitude’. If you ate would depend if you were agood little mindless slave or not. No acquiescence, no food and no water – thesupply and distribution of food would be monitored so that no-one could givefood to a fugitive of the system, as Dr Day put it (Fig 690). But the power isstill with the people if only we would come together in mutual support and theinternational publicity and response to the Beauchamp story in Drummondville ledto the council relenting and even asking the couple to help draft a new lawrelating to gardens growing food. The bloodlines are terrified that the peoplewill unite – that’s why dividing and ruling us is the top priority.[../Images/00160.jpg]Figure 690: Whatever you do we’ll make it illegal.‘Human-settlement zones’So, as billions are moved from the land eventually, what will they find? This isthe other wing of the strategy, the high-rise, high-density cities where what isleft of the masses after the cull will live in microchipped, 24/7 surveillancein slavery to the El-lite living at a distance in the Capitols. Already buildingregulations are being changed to bring about the very high-density that Agenda21 describes. There are conferences bloody galore worldwide pressing for allthis. A bloke called Shobhakar Dhakal, Executive Director of the Tokyo-basedGlobal Carbon Project, spoke at the Planet Under Pressure Conference in Londonin 2012 to promote dense urban cities straight from the pages of Agenda 21justified by the threat of global warming. Yawn. ‘Re-engineering cities isurgently needed for global sustainability’, he said, when he surely meantsustainable control. Then like all of these full-of-bollocks academics, he comesout with a line that is utterly without meaning: ‘Our focus should be onenhancing the quality of urbanization – from urban space, infrastructure, formand function, to lifestyle, energy choices and efficiency.’ What the fuck doesthat mean in terms of what it will be like? Energy choices? Whose choices? Theyare already installing Smart Meters that allow everyone’s heating to be raisedand lowered from a central location. Oh their choices, okay, I am with you now.This is what ‘choice’ and ‘local consultation’ means in Agenda 21 – what theEl-lite want, the El-lite will have. Planet under Pressure chief scientistMichail Fragkias told MSNBC that the answer to population growth is densercities: ‘If cities can develop in height rather than in width that would be muchmore preferable and environmentally not as harmful.’ This is also straight fromthe pages of Agenda 21. The London conference was attended by Professor KariNorgaard of Oregon University who compared those challenging the official storyon climate change to supporting racism and slavery and said that such peoplewere suffering from a sickness that had to be ‘treated’; so you get a feel forwhere it was coming from. Yale University professor, Karen Seto, who spoke atthe conference, said the following to MSNBC in a stunning confirmation of whatthe game really is. Speaking of people packed in the cities, she said: ‘... wecertainly don’t want them strolling about the entire countryside. We want themto save land for nature by living closely [together]’ By ‘them’, she clearlydidn’t mean herself. The arrogance of these people is boundless. These were thebullet points in the Planet Under Pressure media release:> • Better land-use zoning and building standards that increase efficiency and> multiple uses [packing people together in the smallest space possible in> high-rise density surrounded by warehouses and factories where the slaves will> be forced to work]> • Reversing the trend to ever larger homes [Ah, there you go – except for> those in the Capitol, of course]> • Ending subsidies that promote low density and leapfrog development and> discourage compact development, or favour cars at the expense of public> transit [packing people together in the smallest space possible in high-rise> density surrounded by warehouses and factories where the slaves will be forced> to work and have no access to a car]> • Improving the quality of inner city schools and addressing other growing> urban challenges, such as growing income inequality, segregation and social> polarization, crime rates and heightened health threats including stress> [waffle and bollocks]> • Through social marketing, foster demand for efficient styles of living> [program people to want what we want][../Images/00153.jpg]Figure 691: Multi-billionaire Bloomberg approves of Agenda 21 micro-‘apartments’within the lines on the floor here.They’re not kidding either. The European Union has banned the building of newsingle family homes from 2020 and the then Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg(Rothschild Zionist), announced that the city was building a newdenselypopulated, pack-them and stack-them housing development made up of‘micro-units’ or ultra-tiny apartments in which swinging a cat would not be anoption. They were described as ‘bigger than a prison cell, but smaller than amobile home’. They are 30 feet by 10 and 1/40th the size of Bloomberg’s New Yorkhome, one of many including an estate in Bermuda (Fig 691). Bloomberg, abig-time insider, said that zone regulations would be waived to allow this tohappen and he referred to the little more than cupboards as ‘studio andone-bedroom apartments’ while not laughing once. Boston is doing somethingsimilar and others will follow. The ‘New Housing Marketplace Plan’ in New Yorkwith an initial 165,000 units eliminates the use of cars and insists that itmust be replaced by walking, cycling and mass transit systems. This is acontinuation of Bloomberg’s PLaNYC 2030 programme to ‘prepare the city for onemillion more residents’ (when they are forced off their land) which involves‘over 25 City agencies to work toward the vision of a greener, greater NewYork’. The plan is to cause so much economic upheaval and collapse that peoplewill be forced into these miniscule ‘homes’ because they have nowhere else to goexcept the street. All this is pure Agenda 21 and so were the words of DavidBragdon, director of the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability:> New Yorkers can be better served by adapting the city’s apartment models to> allow more efficient and sustainable homes. Today’s announcement is fulfilment> of the pledge in PlaNYC, the Mayor’s long-term sustainability strategy, to> update the City’s regulations to better accommodate the population and> demographics of the future.Did he mention that it was sustainable? The plan even has the development builtnext to a transit train system – exactly what is envisaged in Agenda 21 – and itis being done, so the story goes, to ‘reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 13percent below 2005 levels’. Bloomberg has been accused of systematically closingevery path to affordable housing available to homeless families. His policieshave thus been described as a failure. Oh, but they’re not if you know what theobjective is. When all paths to affordable housing are blocked you are left withtaking what is offered – cupboards 30 feet by ten. This is the man who said thathomeless people were staying longer in the city’s homeless shelters because theexperience was too ‘pleasurable’. The remark was described as ‘offensive andshocking’; but then he is. Bloomberg throws into sharp relief the ‘us and them’world of the sectors and Capitols that the bloodlines plan to impose. While themayor was revealing plans for micro-’apartments’, his own property portfolioruns to something like 13 homes and estates. Will he give up any of those, ordownsize, in the interests of saving the planet? Can pigs water ski? Or is thatnot sustainable? Bloomberg, the 7th richest man in the United States and 13th inthe world with a net worth of £27 billion, knows that human-caused climatechange is nonsense and that it’s only an excuse to enslave people. During histhree terms in office Bloomberg oversaw policies which left 50,000 people,including 21,000 children, in emergency shelters – a rise of more than 60percent since he took office. The gap between rich and poor in Manhattan is thesecond biggest in America; the poverty rate is the highest in a decade with onein three New York children below the poverty line; and there are as manyhomeless as there were during the Great Depression. But once you have them onthe floor and desperate you can give them a take-it-or-leave-it with your newcupboard ‘apartments’. Bloomberg also announced in August 2012, precisely inline with Agenda 21, that the New York Police and Microsoft were introducing theDomain Awareness System that will allow the police to monitor thousands ofsurveillance cameras and licence plate readers on police cars, bridges, tunnelsand streets and instantly access detailed information about anyone they target.Cheers Microsoft, nice one. Bill Gates must be beaming as they sell thetechnology to other police forces all over the world. New York City PoliceDepartment Commissioner Raymond W Kelly announced plans to install license platereader cameras ‘in every lane of traffic on all of the bridges and tunnels thatserve as entrances and exits to Manhattan’. No one will be able to drive into orout of Manhattan without potentially being recorded. New York has become underBloomberg one of the cities at the forefront of all aspects of Agenda 21including its increasingly brutal occupation force, or police ‘army’. Bloombergsaid: ‘I have my own army in the NYPD, which is the seventh largest army in theworld.’ Well actually it isn’t, but give them time. Notice that the NYPD is notdescribed as the police force of the people of New York, but as Bloomberg’spersonal ‘my own army’. Billions of federal dollars – taxpayers’ dollars andmore debt for taxpayers – are being handed to states and local authoritiesacross America to build the infrastructure to enslave those same taxpayers andtheir children and grandchildren. Research into the best building and urbandesigns to most enslave the population are going on at government agencies likethe Oak Ridge National Laboratory which announced in 2006 that the Fort Braggmilitary base in North Carolina would become a prototype for future cities with‘security measures’ embedded. Fort Bragg is a US psychological warfare centre.California schemingIf you are considered a ‘sustainable developer’ (building the infrastructure forAgenda 21) you are not subject to the planning laws like everyone else. Thefederal government which is already in catastrophic debt is throwing money atthese schemes via the Departments of Housing and Urban Development andTransportation and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Wall Street Journalreported in April 2012 that California was changing building regulations toensure that smaller houses were built with greater density. The paper said thatmetropolitan area governments are adopting plans to require most new housing tobe built at 20 or more to the acre. This is at least five times the traditionalquarter acre per house. ‘State and regional planners also seek to radicallyrestructure urban areas, forcing much of the new hyperdensity development intonarrowly confined corridors’, the report said. This is absolutely the plan inaction of Agenda 21. The mandatory density is 30 homes per acre in someCalifornia counties, including Los Angeles, and the move is once again promotedto reduce car use and CO2 emissions under the laws based on a lie like the 2006Global Warming Solutions Act and the 2008 Sustainable Communities and ClimateProtection Act. Wendell Cox, a transport consultant, said that this was aneffort to make the building of detached houses illegal (except in the Capitols).As I write, San Francisco is proposing to reduce the minimum size of livingspace to 150 square feet – a school bus is 250 square feet. The Royal Instituteof British Architects has called for minimum space regulations to stem theincessant reduction in the size of homes. It points out that the average size ofa newly built one-bed home is the size of a London tube carriage – just 46square metres. The British government’s ‘bedroom tax’ in which people lose apercentage of benefit payments for each unoccupied bedroom is also pressingpeople into living in a smaller and smaller space. Agenda 21 has been creepingup on the world for decades and now we need to face it. Watch also for thebuilding of new high-speed rail routes and the upgrading of current ones. Thisis already happening in the United States after decades of neglect and rundownand the British Government announced in 2012 a plan for what it called ‘thebiggest investment in railways since the Victorian era’. There has also been amassive expansion in high-speed rail links across Europe and I know for a factthat some of those publicly working for railway companies on continuingexpansion are actually employees of NATO. The trains that took the Hunger Gamescombatants from their sectors or districts to the Capitol in the movie areprecisely the mode of transport planned in Agenda 21. A key aspect of Agenda 21is to link the megacities with railways and to have trains as the main form oftransport for the slaves (when they are allowed to move). A prime promoter ofnew railway building is the Rockefeller-sponsored America 2050. Thehigh-density, high-rise units in ‘human settlement centres’ are also planned tobe built along railway tracks, current and new. How predictable it was then thata strategic plan for ‘high-speed rail’ in America announced by the ObamaAdministration in 2009 should include connecting the very areas of the countrydesignated as the eleven megaregions (Fig 692). Compare it with the earliermegaregions map (Fig 693 overleaf). They are mirrors of each other. Americanrailways were dying and largely forgotten in the age of the plane, but suddenlyall that changed when Obama entered the White House. Billions are now beingpoured into railway infrastructure to connect the megaregions and this isanother money-no-object operation.[../Images/00233.jpg]Figure 692: Massive increases in spending on new railways and the expansion ofcurrent lines.[../Images/00083.jpg]Figure 693: The high-speed rail programme fits perfectly with the map of theplanned megaregions.Programming the kidsThe timescale appears to be, if you look at names such as America 2050 that itwill be today’s children and grandchildren that will have to live in thefully-fledged Agenda 21 although all people alive today are going to experienceits gathering extremes. Many already are as we have seen. Children are the primetargets, however, and they are being programmed to accept their slavery as the‘norm’, as the way things are. Children are being targeted and terrified byclimate change propaganda, not least by the trendy celebrity pseudo-leftiessitting on their pots of gold. One example is film director Richard Curtis, whowrote Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Here is anotherbuy-the-official story merchant who circulated a climate change propaganda filmthat had children and celebrities exploding with blood splashing in alldirections when they didn’t accept climate change orthodoxy. It was rightlywithdrawn in the face of public disgust, but it was only an extreme example ofwhat is happening drip by drip all the time. Children are being conditioned tobelieve that the world will end unless we ‘do something’ and that means thetransformation of human existence envisioned by Agenda 21. Children and youngpeople today are the most mercilessly targeted with Agenda 21 programming sothat they will accept their lives as robotic slaves and the end of parenthood.The indoctrination is also designed to turn children against their parents for‘destroying the world that we have to live in’. The bloodline-created andcontrolled United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), first headed by eugenicist Julian Huxley, declared that 2005 to 2015is ‘The Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)’ to teach(indoctrinate) all 40 chapters of Agenda 21. I shall translate: The Decade ofProgramming Children to Accept Their Fate of Life-long Slavery and to ‘LoveTheir Servitude’. Here is a taste of the official propaganda:> The Decade of ESD is a far-reaching and complex undertaking ... that> potentially touches on every aspect of life. The basic vision ... is a world> where everyone ... learns the values, behavior, and lifestyles required for a> sustainable future and for positive societal transformation.This means ‘a world where everyone learns how to do what we tell them’. Now,here’s a stunner and a fundamental reason why education is being dumbed downever more obviously:> Generally, more highly educated people who have higher incomes can consume> more resources than poorly educated people who tend to have lower incomes. In> this case more education increases the threat to sustainability.The implications of that statement are colossal. Maintain the children in astate of ignorance and so produce uneducated adults who will unquestioninglyobey the state because they know no better. Mathematics is being especiallytargeted and they are even saying that the answers to mathematical questionsshould be arrived at through ‘consensus’. Okay, children, who agrees that 2 + 2= 4? Seven of you. Right, and 2 + 2 = 5? Ah, eleven. Well, 5 it is then. Now,who agrees that seven hands in the air equals seven and eleven hands in the aircomes to eleven? Oh, Peter you say that seven hands should equal 254 ... do wehave a consensus on that? Why is mathematics such a target? Silent Weapons forQuiet Wars talks about ‘Disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mentalactivities; providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics,logic, systems design and economics; and discouraging technical creativity’.This process has been going on for decades but it is nowhere near where theywant to take it. The school, college and university systems around the world areprogramming their laboratory specimens to see themselves and the world in theway that advances human enslavement and this is being done on a daily basis byteachers and academics who are themselves as programmed, if not more so, thanthose with whom they are sharing their programming. But, then, teach it the waywe tell you or you are out of the door. As Richard Day predicted from knowledgeof the agenda in 1969, children would spend ‘more time in schools, but pupilswouldn’t learn anything’. Ask most children anywhere today about climate changeand the overwhelming majority will repeat the official story. Ask them whatneeds to be done and it will be the same. ‘Environment and sustainability’ arethe buzz words infiltrating every aspect of education and government. Part ofthe reason for increasing university and college tuition fees to unrepayablelevels is to drive the poor and middle classes out of what passes for highereducation altogether.Children are the target of Agenda 21 in many other ways, too. One of its goalsis that children are to be raised by the state and not parents. This was thevision in Brave New World, published in 1932 and written by Fabian andeugenicist, Aldous Huxley, brother of UNESCO Julian. Brave New World described asociety in which parents had no contact with their children, indeed one in whichthere were no parents because children were produced in ‘World State hatcheries’according to genetic types which is similar to the Indian (Archon-Reptilian)caste system. Dr Richard Day talked about technology being used for reproductionwithout sex and families diminishing in importance. Look at how parental rightsand choice are being constantly eroded and those decisions taken by the state,often through the school system. Day said that schools would be the hub of thecommunity. I have highlighted in my books and on my website for years howchildren are being taken from loving parents by child protection services(inversion) and social services that increasingly justify the initials ‘SS’.Parents are losing their children to state adoption for refusing to have theirchildren vaccinated and their immune systems poleaxed; for refusing medicaltreatment for conditions such as cancer when they know that the chemotherapy andradiation will surely kill their children while making them suffer unspeakably;for having a different lifestyle or refusing to obey the dictates of these SSagents. I have detailed so many stories about the SS agencies stealing children,but here’s an example to give you the theme that is becoming more draconian incases and number by the week. An American mother gave birth in an ambulance onthe way to the Hershey Medical Center in Pennsylvania and when she arrived staffgave the baby an injection. The mother asked why this was happening and she wastold: It’s just to help’. To help what exactly was never revealed. Incredibly,after the injection had been given, the mother said that the nurse asked her ifshe was allergic to what the baby had been given, the drug oxytocin. The motherwas then told that her baby was first healthy, then ‘very sick’ and an hourlater that she was doing well and could go home. More hours passed and themother was told that the baby would have to be kept in hospital for 48 to 72hours and when she asked why the mother was told that there was nothing wrongwith the baby but ‘the law requires us to keep the baby for 48 hours’ (there isno such law in Pennsylvania). Later in the day a government social worker namedAngelica Lopez-Heagy came to the mother and said that she was underinvestigation. When she asked on what grounds, Lopez-Heagy said that it wasagainst the law to tell her the allegations. The mother said in that case shewould not answer questions. Lopez-Heagy replied: ‘Since you’re not going tocooperate, I’ll just go and call the police and we can take custody of thebaby.’ This use of fear and intimidation convinced the mother to answer thequestions and she realised that the allegations involved refusing to giveconsent for the baby’s medical treatment. Lopez-Heagy, who sounds such a lovelylady, indicated that the mother had refused to allow a ‘vitamin K shot’ for thebaby when the mother said she had never even been asked about it. Vitamin K isgiven to all new born babies as a matter of course on the basis that a Vitamin Kdeficiency that can lead to bruising and bleeding. It is my view that there ismore in ‘Vitamin K’ than we are being told and that includes at leastpreservatives that attack a far from developed immune system. Access to everybaby at birth and the bloodlines are going to miss an opportunity like that?Next step in this disgusting saga was that the mother was asked for permissionto give her baby an injection for Hepatitis B. The mother said that she wouldonly agree if she could see test results to confirm that she needed it. She wastold that they had forgotten to test earlier in the day, but they had to do itnow without testing. She was also told that she had to sign a ‘safety plan’ forher baby and when she refused to bow to this intimidation, and said that shewanted her husband and attorney to read the plan first, the social worker calledthe police and, without a court order, they took custody of the baby through thelie that she was suffering from injury or illness. Once the social worker hadcontrol of the baby she consented to the injection for Hepatitis B. The idiotpolice then threw the mother out of the hospital because she had refused to signa safety plan. When her husband arrived, both were escorted from the hospitalgrounds. The mother was told that she could return every three hours to nursethe baby and this meant that she and her husband had to spend the night sleepingin a car outside – when she had given birth only hours before. Remember the nameof the hospital if you live in the area – the Hershey Medical Center inPennsylvania. But this is far closer to the norm (and getting closer) thanpeople imagine.The mother was given her baby back eventually and the Home School Legal DefenseAssociation is taking the case to court, but most parents do not have theirchildren returned by these SS fascists. They are given to foster homes andadopted and often the parents are never allowed to see them again. Can youimagine how painful that must be? I have had experience of many heart-breakingcases like this and come across the cold, heartless and callous social workers,police officers and courts that enforce this Nazism. But this is only the startif we continue to stand aside and let this happen. The Scottish government tookthe state kidnapping of children to even greater depths in 2013 when itannounced plans to appoint a ‘state guardian’ for every child from birth. Theseindividuals will be appointed by the heads of the state health boards for thefirst five years of a child’s life when responsibility will be transferred tocouncils. Their job will be to oversee the parents on behalf of the state,simple as that, and if they don’t bring up the child as the state demands thenthey are going to be in trouble and very possibly childless. Aileen Campbell,the truly idiotic Scottish Children’s Minister, said that a specific individualwill have the responsibility of overseeing the wellbeing of specific childrenand this will ‘make sure there is someone having an overview of what ishappening to that child, to make sure that early indicators of anything thatwould pose a threat or risk to that child are flagged up’. I propose that aPeople’s guardian be appointed to oversee every politician so that earlyindicators of anything that would pose a threat or risk to the People and theirmost basic freedoms – like Aileen Campbell – are flagged up. Stuart Waiton, asociology and criminology lecturer at Scotland’s University of Abertay Dundee,was right when he said:> Essentially, the idea of a specific person looking after the interests of a> child coming with the name of ‘father’ or ‘mother’ has been lost from Scottish> society – or at least lost within the corridors of power. Increasingly,> decisions about our children’s wellbeing are being taken out of our hands. Not> just education, but sex, health, lifestyle, even political life is taught to> children by people outside the home.> In Dundee, where I live, I hear of cases where children are instructed to tell> their parents that the school doesn’t approve of the contents of the> parent-provided lunchbox. Elsewhere, we hear of teachers reporting parents to> social services for allowing their children to ‘risk’ cycling to school. And> just about everywhere we have children being encouraged to tell their own> parents off for smoking or drinking at home.> The recognition of the importance of privacy, of the authority of parents and> the protection of this privacy and authority by society is declining fast.

This is why nobody is attacking this new bill in defence of privacy> and the autonomous family.This is all absolutely in line with the long-planned goals of the Archonticsocial engineers. The constant erosion of parental rights is only theTotalitarian Tiptoe to no rights at all when the state will bring up allchildren and eventually give ‘birth’ to them technologically. Financialincentives are given to these organisations to meet government targets foradoption when every case should be taken on its merits not as another inflow ofcapital.The man who introduced this policy in Britain was hardly surprisingly theRothschild tea-maker, Tony Blair. Why would you want to give financialincentives for children to be adopted to meet targets, Mr Blair? Is theresomething we should know? More than ten thousand children a year are now removedfrom their parents by the state in Britain and the excuses are becomingincreasingly ludicrous and bizarre. But the parents have got little chance oncethe process starts and they become suffocated by the deeply corrupt and biasedsecret Family Court system which is stacked against them from the start with themedia barred from reporting these cases and exposing the child traffickingracket which is what much of it has become. This, too, is the TotalitarianTiptoe to Agenda 21. Almost everything is today as they close on their target."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00126.jpg]Genetic MutationStrong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discusspeople.SocratesThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and its like aroundthe world play the same role as the Environmental Protection Agency (inversion).The FDA seeks to destroy small farmers and growers, especially those usingorganic and natural methods of production, because the idea is for the Archonticcorporations to be the only source of food and its content.More and more laws are being introduced to make it as difficult as possible toproduce your own food and share it with the community. This includes theEuropean Union banning the sale of things like homemade jam, marmalade orchutney in re-used jars. This has been done for centuries, but the bureaucratsthat allow the often lethal products of the corporations to circulateunchallenged say that re-used jars are dangerous to health. On that basis it isthe bureaucrats that should be banned, then. The US Department of Agricultureeven claims to own the name ‘organic’. Armed goons from the Food and DrugAdministration are now regularly raiding – often violently – farmers, growersand producers of raw milk. Anything nutritious is being labelled unsafe –exactly as Dr Richard Day said it would be. Producers of raw milk which is stillallowed to be sold in other parts of the world, including Britain, are subjectto intimidation and violent suppression in the United States by FDA thugs andthose from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) who, like the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, are simply vehicles for the food, drug and land-grabbingcorporations to destroy the opposition and impose Agenda 21 (Fig 694). Producersof organic food and dietary supplements and those with non-drug-based treatmentsfor cancer and other disease are the constant targets of these corporationMafias masquerading as government agencies. Nutritious food and drink is beingso brutally and constantly suppressed because they want us to consume theirchemical-antibiotic-growth-hormone-infested-genetically-modified-health-and-wellbeing-catastrophesfor their dire effect on people mentally, emotionally and ‘physically’. Geneticmanipulation of human DNA through genetically-modified food affects the waypeople receive and transmit information and interact with reality while thechemical cocktails can make people weaker, less sharpminded and emotionallyimbalanced, depressed and subservient. We see chemicals and genetic modificationas something ‘physical’ (holographic) in Mind-Body reality, but in their basestate they are distorted (that word again) waveform information fields thatdistort the mental, emotional and holographic fields of Mind-Body. The AmericanAcademy of Environmental Medicine recommended that all doctors prescribenon-genetically modified food and that all patients should be told of known andpotential health consequences of GMO. Jeffrey M Smith, executive director of theInstitute for Responsible Technology, wrote:[../Images/00217.jpg]Figure 694: ‘Come on brave men, bring your guns – a raw milk producer is on theloose.’> GMOs ... appear to trigger the immune systems of both mice and rats as if they> were under attack.

But when scientists such as French toxicologist G.E. Seralini> re-analyzed Monsanto’s raw data, it actually showed that the rats fed GM corn> suffered from clear signs of toxicity – evidence that industry scientists> skillfully overlooked.The cause and effect between GMO and disease is confirmed by the fact that thereare countless examples of people and animals recovering – often dramatically –from their health conditions after removing GMO from their diet. Americancardiologist Dr William Davis told CBS News that modern wheat is a ‘perfect,chronic poison’ and he said that it contains a new protein called gliadin whichcauses people to gain weight. He said that when people have stopped eating wheatthey have lost sometimes massive amounts of weight and chronic health conditionshave disappeared:> If three people lost eight pounds, big deal. But we’re seeing hundreds of> thousands of people losing 30, 80, 150 pounds. Diabetics become no longer> diabetic; people with arthritis having dramatic relief. People losing leg> swelling, acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and on and on> every day.Danish pig farmer Ib Borup Perderson cured his animals of a whole range ofillness when he stopped feeding them a GMO diet. Perderson said that after hebegan using GMO the pigs developed chronic diarrhoea, birth defects,reproductive problems, reduced appetite, bloating, stomach ulcers and had weakerand smaller piglets with reduced litter sizes. There were noticeableimprovements in two days after he ditched the GMO and their restoration tohealth went on from there. The same has happened with people after their doctorsadvised them to stop eating GMO (increasingly not easy in America). Patientswith apparently long-term, even permanent conditions such as immune disorders,allergies, skin problems, arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, migraines andrestless leg syndrome saw their symptoms disappear as the GMO disappeared fromtheir diet. Put these words into a search engine for many examples: ‘DramaticHealth Recoveries Reported By Patients Who Took Their Doctor’s Advice andStopped Using GMO Foods’.[../Images/00136.jpg]Figure 695: The dark areas are countries that have fallen togenetically-modified crops and now they are setting their sights on Europe,Africa and the rest of the world.Genetically-modifying the worldMonsanto and Big Biotech control of government agencies has allowed theintroduction of genetically-modified crops and food without the need to provetheir safety (they can’t because they’re cumulatively lethal). Big Biotech hashad it a bit tougher in Europe with GMO because of public protests, but they areworking to open the door there, too, or rather the floodgates (Fig 695).European Union bureaucrats are definitely in the Monsanto camp and they will bewaiting for their opportunity to drop the current limits on GMO activity. TheBritish Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is campaigning for GMO crops to begrown in the UK using provable lies and misrepresentation and he’s supported bythe in-the-hip-pocket asset of the Rothschilds, banks and corporations,Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. The European Food Safety (Control)Authority has already produced ‘guidance’ on assessing the environmental risksof GMO which is paving the way for Monsanto to move in on Europe with itsFrankenstein food (Fig 696). WikiLeaks released American diplomatic cablesrevealing how the US Government, a Monsanto subsidiary, was seeking ways toretaliate against Europe for refusing to use GMO seeds. This included launchingtrade wars against countries that would not comply with Monsanto’s demands.Cables from 2007 reveal that Craig Stapleton, the US ambassador to France and abusiness partner of then US President Boy George Bush, wrote under hiscover-name ‘Country team Paris’ to outline plans to pressure Europe to acceptMonsanto GMO:[../Images/00411.jpg]Figure 696: Eat your greens now before they mutate.> Country team Paris recommends that we calibrate a target retaliation list that> causes some pain across the EU since this [resistance to GMO] is a collective> responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits.

Moving to retaliation will> make clear that the current path has real costs to EU interests and could help> strengthen European pro-biotech voices.Other US State Department cables expose US diplomats as working directly forMonsanto and Big Biotech. One said: ‘In response to recent urgent requests by[Spanish rural affairs ministry] state secretary Josep Puxeu and Monsanto, postrequests renewed US government support of Spain’s science-based agriculturalbiotechnology position through high-level US government intervention.’ Thecables show how the US and Spain have worked together to block the strengtheningof biotech laws within the EU. A cable from the US Embassy in Madrid said: ‘IfSpain falls, the rest of Europe will follow.’ Other cables revealed how Americandiplomats requested funding to send lobbyists for the biotech industry to meetpoliticians and agricultural officials in ‘target countries’. These includedcountries in Africa, Latin America and Europe. In a cable sent from the USSlovakian consulate in 2005, the State Department is told that the local post‘will continue its efforts to dispel myths about GMOs and advocate on behalf ofMonsanto’. But even this scale of bias and corruption is not enough forMonsanto, which has been called the most evil corporation in the world – a viewwith which I would not dream of disagreeing. A Scottish chap called Hugh Grantis Monsanto’s CEO and earns millions a year for his trouble. I guess that buys alot of pills to help him sleep at night, or at least if I was CEO of Monsantothey would be essential for me. If only these people realised that the energeticand so experiential consequences for actions in this life do not end when youleave this reality they might find a mirror and have a bloody good look.Monsanto sought to make additions to the 2012 Farm Bill and the 2013 AgricultureAppropriations Bill to prevent the government from stopping GMO or enforcingchecks on its safety. Mike Adams, who does a great job exposing the food andhealth conspiracy at Naturalnews.com, said: ‘America’s agricultural future couldliterally end up being controlled entirely by the biotech industry, which willhave full immunity from the law.’ This is the plan for every country andcommunity on Earth under Agenda 21. The rider to the Agriculture AppropriationsBill was included by Congressman John ‘Jack’ Kingston from Georgia who has beendescribed as one of Monsanto’s professional whores. Who am I to argue? Kingstonwas named 2011-2012 ‘Legislator of the Year’ by the Biotechnology IndustryOrganization (Monsanto, Dupont, et al) for helping ‘to protect funding forprograms essential to the survival of biotechnology companies across the UnitedStates’. Survival, my arse. Kingston’s contribution to the bill was to compelthe US Secretary of Agriculture to immediately grant temporary approval orderegulation of a GMO crop on request from Big Biotech even if that crop’ssafety is in question or under review. Additions to the 2012 Farm Bill hiddenaway as deeply as possible were aimed to delete what regulation there is onMonsanto and GMO and, as Mike Adams put it, allow Big Food to dictate what foodis grown and how it is grown. The so-called ‘Monsanto Protection Act’ was dulypassed.[../Images/00285.jpg]Figure 697: The population is a laboratory ‘experiment’ – except that theyalready know the outcome.The GMO nightmareClearly Monsanto, Big Biotech, Big Government and Big Media have no interest intelling the public the truth about GMO and the consequences for every man,woman, child, animal, insect and plant on the planet when they know that thetruth is horrific (Fig 967). The 2011 Global Citizens’ report, The GMO EmperorHas No Clothes, revealed the following:> • Contrary to the claim of feeding the world, genetic engineering has not> increased the yield of a single crop.> • Herbicide tolerant (Roundup Ready) crops were supposed to control weeds> while crops with the biological herbicide Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) were> intended to control pests ... but GMO crops have led to the emergence of> superweeds and super pests ... herbicide resistant crops such as Roundup Ready> cotton can create the risk of herbicide resistant ‘superweeds’ by transferring> the herbicide resistance to the weeds.> • Despite claims that genetically modified organisms will lower the levels of> chemicals (pesticides and herbicides) used, quite the opposite has occurred,> with 1.6 billion pounds of glyphosate (the active in ingredient in Roundup)> being applied to American soil in 2007 alone. This is of great concern both> because of the negative impacts of these chemicals on ecosystems and humans,> and because there is the danger that increased chemical use will cause pests> and weeds to develop resistance, requiring even more chemicals in order to> manage them.> • Monsanto has been claiming that through genetic engineering it can breed> crops for drought tolerance and other climate-resilient traits. This is a> false promise.> • Among the false claims made by Monsanto and the Biotechnology industry is> that GMO foods are safe. However, there are enough independent studies to show> that GMO foods can cause severe health damage.This is what Monsanto is producing, governments are allowing and Bill Gates isfunding and promoting. A study by the National Council for Scientific andTechnical Research in Buenos Aires, Argentina, found that glyphosate can causebirth defects in unborn children. Molecular biologist Jack Heinemann at theUniversity of Canterbury in Australia has warned after an extensive study thatGMO wheat has the potential to destroy the liver. He said:> What we found is that the molecules created in this wheat, intended to silence> [shut down] wheat genes, can match human genes, and through ingestion, these> molecules can enter human beings and potentially silence our genes. We found> over 770 pages of potential matches between these two genes in wheat and the> human genome. We found over a dozen matches that are extensive and identical,> and sufficient to cause silencing in experimental systems.> The findings are absolutely assured. There’s no doubt that these matches exist> ... from this information, we know that it’s plausible there will be an> adverse effect and therefore that’s why we’re calling for a particular battery> of experiments to be done before humans eat this wheat.This is not the result of idiotic incompetence, but calculated design. Childrenwho are born with such ‘silenced genes’ tend to die by the age of about fivewhile adults get more and more sick and tired until they are very sick indeed,says biochemist Professor Judy Carman, director at the Flinders University inAdelaide. I have been saying again and again through the years thatgenetically-modified food is designed to geneticallymodify us. Mother Jonesmagazine reported in 2012:> This year, an Austrian study connected exposure to Roundup UltraMax to DNA> damage. The scientists noted that they saw damage even when Roundup was> diluted 450 times more than its typical agricultural concentration.> In March, a study out of the University of Pittsburgh reported that tadpoles> exposed to Roundup changed shape due to their stress hormones responding to> Roundup as if to a predator – a study of particular note since Monsanto has> long claimed that Roundup only affects plants, not animals, as it targets an> enzyme present only in plants. And in April, scientists out of a Shanghai> medical school reported that glyphosate had neurodegenerative impacts> associated with conditions like Parkinson’s.Genetic Roulette is an excellent documentary that you can watch on YouTube andit is highly recommended. The film reveals that since the 1990s whengenetically-modified food began to impact upon the American diet the number ofAmericans with at least three chronic diseases has nearly doubled and thenation’s position in the world table for infant mortality has ‘plunged’. Cancer,heart disease, autism, obesity, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and food allergies havesoared in the same period while the fertility of the land is being devastated,genetic diversity destroyed, and between 60 and 100 percent of air samples takenby the US Geological Survey contain Monsanto’s lethal Roundup herbicide which isused in vast quantities in essential conjunction with GMO crops. As onecommentator put it: ‘When simply breathing makes you susceptible to glyphosateexposure, we know we are dealing with a problem of unprecedented scale.’ Peoplein cities far away from the crop fields have Roundup in their urine and it is inthe blood of pregnant women and unborn children. Glyphosate was discovered to be‘flowing freely into the groundwater in areas where it is being applied’ by astudy for the journal Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry and it has beenfound in all of the urine tested from non-agricultural workers in Berlin atlevels between five and twenty times the limit for drinking water. Studies havefound an increase of up to 70 times in the birth defects of children born toworkers on farms spraying Roundup or ‘glyphosate’. European tests have suggestedthat animals begin to suffer liver damage with .0001 parts per million (ppm) ofglyphosate in water. The US Environmental Protection [inversion] Agency allows.7ppm – 7,000 times higher. GMO corn contains 13ppm – 130,000 times higher thanEPA water ‘standards’. The Archontic US Environmental Protection (inversion)Agency agreed in 2013 to Monsanto’s request that its lethal Roundup (glyphosate)be legally allowed in food at levels a million times higher than those shown tocause cancer. A study by researchers at the University of Sherbrooke HospitalCentre in Quebec, Canada, found GMO toxins in the blood of all the pregnantwomen and their unborn children who were tested. We are now having pre-pubertylittle girls as young as eight getting ovarian cancer – almost unheard of beforeall this madness began. Monsanto’s Bt herbicide toxins have been shown to damagered mammalian blood cells among other things. These deliver oxygen to bodytissues. The world is insane, those that control it are insane, and all I haveto say to prove that obvious truth is ‘geneticallymodified organisms’. Never inknown human history has such a mass destruction of the genetic pool beenembarked upon, but here we are. It is insane that it is being done and it isinsane the number of people prepared by choice to stand for it and feedthemselves and their children Frankenstein food designed to damage their healthand end their lives long before this would naturally happen.Here are just a few examples of the magnitude of crazy. I am not even talkingyour average crazy. I mean full-blown clinical insanity where the patient shouldnever be left alone for their own sake and for the protection of everyone else.We are talking Hannibal Lecter on a really bad day. Genetically-modified cropsand animals intersplice the DNA genetic code between different animals and cropsand even between animals and crops with some human genes thrown in. This rewiresthe natural order and generates new diseases and susceptibility to diseaseswhich the immune system cannot deal with. They are genetically combiningcabbages with scorpion venom, spiders with goats, fish with tomatoes and humangenes with rice. We also have cats geneticallyengineered to glow in the dark andbananas, potatoes, lettuce and carrots manipulated to produce vaccines andrelease them when eaten (Fig 698). Have a banana – take your shot. This isanother way of imposing enforced mass medication by eventually producing onlymedicated food. One of the biggest of so many health dangers from all this isinflammation in various forms which can lead to a stream of diseases includingkidney and heart disease, disorders of the digestive and immune systems, cancer,diabetes and Alzheimer’s. This does not even begin to be a complete list. Allthis has been allowed by the Big Biotech-controlled US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) which is officially an agency of government protecting thepopulation from Big Biotech. This is what people need to understand – thecorporations control all the agencies of government that are officially there topolice them. The crazies that Australians allow to control their country havegiven permission for ‘trials’ (foot in the door to mass introduction) ofgenetically-modified wheat with major consequences for human health without anytests to establish its short-term and long-term effects. The CommonwealthScientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia has kindlyand sanely produced a form of wheat – with manipulated proteins that suppressesenzymes – which scientists believe could have deadly consequences for the liver.Already there are clear genetic changes taking place within children with someas young as six starting puberty and, according to German researchers, the onsetof puberty is falling by four to five months every decade. GMO along with foodand drink additives etc., etc. are combining to change the human geneticstructure. At the same time tens of millions of genetically-modified insects arebeing released without any checks whatsoever into the consequences of suchmadness. This has once again been allowed because of the biotech industry’scontrol of the political and agency decision-making processes, including theWorld Health Organization. Dr Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch UK, said:‘The public will be shocked to learn that GM insects can be released into theenvironment without any proper oversight. Conflicts-of-interest should beremoved from all decision-making processes to ensure the public have a propersay about these plans.’ If you have got this far in the book I doubt anythingwould shock you anymore. The next generation of GMOs is now appearing under thename biopharmaceutical or ‘pharm crops’. These are genetically-manipulated toproduce pharmaceutical and industrial chemicals including human and animalvaccines, growth hormones, blood clotting agents, human antibodies,contraceptives and drugs that induce abortion. Cross contamination with cropsfor consumption has already happened and led to a pathetic $500,000 fine forbiotech company, ProdiGene. The effect of growing this stuff on soil andessential insects is unknown, but the signs are not good given that theProdiGene incident involved crops for human consumption being contaminated bysimply being planted where biopharmaceutical crops had been.Genetically-modified corn has been manipulated to produce its own insecticidewhich punches holes in the stomachs and intestines of predators and when this isconsumed the insecticide can breach the walls of the human intestine and releaseundigested food into the body (Fig 699). The immune system understandably treatsthis as a threat and produces an immune response to deal with it. From thispoint the immune system is programmed to see the food involved as a danger andattacks whenever it is eaten. This is why there has been such a catastrophicincrease in food allergies among consumers of GMO. The same immune response hasalso been linked to autism and premature aging among much else, includingcancer. Monsanto GMO crops are designed to work with Monsanto Roundup herbicidewhich kills weeds by sucking out their nutrients. But it does the same to thecrops and the animals that eat the crops and the humans who eat the crops andanimals. GMO ‘agriculture’ also removes the nutrients from the soil. You can seethe pattern. This is all planned and connects with the Codex Alimentarius lawsto drastically reduce the allowed doses of dietary supplements to below thenutrient levels needed for survival let alone health. This is the masspopulation cull in action once again. Get those who are asleep directly throughGMO contamination and nutrient-free food and stop the awakening from overcomingthat through a high-enough dosage of nutrient supplements. This is also beingdone by literally policing what children eat and ensuring that they only eatshite. The United States Department of Agriculture and the (Orwellian) ‘Divisionof Child Development and Early Education’ at the Department of Health and HumanServices come into play here, because they have the power to dictate whatchildren have for lunch. A state employee (numbskull) at West Hoke Elementary inRaeford, North Carolina, decided, for example, that the lunch that a preschoolchild brought from home was not nutritious enough. It consisted of a turkey andcheese sandwich, a banana, potato chips and apple juice. The Goebbels-wannabemade the child instead eat ‘real food’ – chicken nuggets. As one commentator putit:[../Images/00417.jpg]Figure 698: Call the cat will you? I can’t see a thing.[../Images/00379.jpg]Figure 699: ‘Eat your corn and one day you will be like me.’> Since when are industrially processed chicken nuggets (aka ‘pink goo’) fried> in genetically modified, rancid vegetable oils and nuked in a microwave> healthier than a turkey and cheese sandwich and a banana brought from home?> School cafeterias don’t even qualify as real kitchens in most cases as> cafeteria workers only have access to giant microwaves that quickly heat up> the overly processed, factory fat laden, genetically modified, agricultural> dumping ground food they serve. The sad truth is that only the cheapest, most> nutritionless, most highly processed garbage food makes the cut for the school> lunch program.Children across the world are being daily abused in mind and body throughmultiple methods and yet most parents are so solidly comatose they can’t evensee that never mind do anything about it. Reuters reported how a team ofmulti-country researchers led by Rob Moodie from the University of Melbourne inAustralia revealed in the British medical journal The Lancet that ‘through theaggressive marketing of ultraprocessed food and drink, multinational companieswere now major drivers of the world’s growing epidemic of chronic diseases suchas heart disease, cancer and diabetes’. The researchers said that industrydocuments proved that companies are seeking ‘to shape health legislation andavoid regulation’. Analysis of published research uncovered ‘systematic bias’from industry funding: ‘Articles sponsored exclusively by food and drinkscompanies were between four and eight times more likely to have conclusions thatfavoured the companies than those not sponsored by them.’Genetically-modified sterilityMonsanto Roundup also causes birth defects, and animals subjected to Rounduphave many pregnancies end prematurely and/or become infertile. In the sameperiod since GMO became widely used in the United States there has been anincredible increase in infertility confirmed by the corresponding increase infertility clinics. Male sperm counts are plummeting and just by coincidence theArchon Cabal have a plan for mass depopulation. A California biotech companycalled Epicyte patented a gene in 2001 that if ingested in any form would makemen and women sterile and infertile. The gene causes the immune system of men toproduce antibodies to kill their own sperm and the sterility that follows isirreversible. When sperm enters women who have consumed the Epicyte gene theyproduce antibodies to the sperm and become infertile. Epicyte scientists tookantibodies from infertile women, isolated the genes responsible for attackingsperm, and genetically-engineered them into corn seeds. Epicyte president MitchHein said: ‘We have a hothouse filled with corn plants that make anti-spermantibodies.’ Mr Heinous said it was a possible solution to overpopulation and hewent on:[../Images/00309.jpg]Figure 700: It kills animals but your kids will be fine.> Essentially, the antibodies are attracted to surface receptors on the sperm.> They latch on and make each sperm so heavy it cannot move forward. It just> shakes about as if it was doing the lambada.Population cullers like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and theRockefeller Foundation must be drooling. Now the good news: Monsanto and Dupontsubsequently formed a joint venture which bought the Epicyte company to‘commercialise’ the Epicyte gene. Rima E Laibow, Medical Director of the NaturalSolutions Foundation, said:> Do you want to know if the food that you’re eating contains the Epicyte gene?> Sure you do. How about the food that your children are eating, or your> grandchildren? Sure you do. But the FDA, the Fraud and Death Administration,> has made sure that under current laws it is illegal for you to have that> information.GMO tested on hamsters, rats and gerbils for three generations has producedstunted babies with under sized internal organs who, if not sterile, have babieswith a 500 percent higher risk of early death (Fig 700).What’s happening to the bees?Terrence Ingram, a beekeeper in Illinois, can testify to what happens when youget in Monsanto’s way and their government agencies show up. Ingram compiled 15years of research to show that Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide poison is killingbees. The number of bee colonies have been falling dramatically in recent yearsand officials say they have no idea why this is so. The implications areenormous because of the role of bees in pollination. Bees pollinate around athird of the crops grown worldwide. It has been officially estimated that if thebees were gone the United States could lose crops worth $15 billion, but thenthat is what the bloodlines want: to make food scarce and control easier (Fig701). They are purposely deleting food sources through chemical andweather-manipulation among other means like destroying soil fertility and seeddiversity. Beekeepers lost 31 percent of their colonies in the months acrosslate 2012 and early 2013 according to research led by Dennis vanEngelstorp, anentomologist at the University of Maryland. He said: ‘We’re getting closer andcloser to the point where we don’t have enough bees in this country to meetpollination demands.’ This is precisely the idea. Terrence Ingram arrived homeone day to find that his beehives had been removed and apparently destroyed bythe US Department of Agriculture which claimed that they were infected with adisease known as foulbrood. Ingram says that this is nonsense and the departmentannounced three weeks later that their ‘evidence’ had disappeared. The theft bythe state included the queen bee and hive that Ingram had been using for hisresearch on the effects of Roundup. He says that he had enough evidence to showthat Roundup is causing the mass bee deaths and Colony Collapse Disorder whichhas destroyed an estimated onethird of honey bees since 2006. Ingram says:[../Images/00169.jpg]Figure 701: Bees have a crucial role in pollinating crops.> [Colony Collapse Disorder] is a calamity that is affecting honeybee colonies> across the nation. In fact, I had one queen, which had survived three summers> of spraying and three winters. I was planning to raise daughters from that> queen to see if she may have had some genetic resistance to Roundup. But she> and her hive were taken during the theft. I don’t even know where the bees and> my equipment are. They ruined 15 years of my research.Ingram said that other beekeepers were fearful that the same would happen tothem in the wake of what is a war on producers of anything that is eitherthreatening to expose or compete with Archon corporations. Meanwhile, Monsantohas acquired Beeologics, one of the leading companies researching into the causeof Colony Collapse Disorder, but I’m sure it was only done in the spirit ofpublic duty to find out what is causing the mayhem in the bee population. BigBiotech insecticides have also been connected to widespread deaths of birds, butwith the corporations involved controlling government agencies little or nothingis done. William Engdahl wrote on the Globalresearch.ca website:> If governments in the EU, USA and other countries fail to impose a total ban> on certain chemical insecticides, not only could bees become a thing of the> past. The human species could face staggering new challenges merely to> survive. The immediate threat comes from the widespread proliferation of> commercial insecticides containing the highly-toxic chemical with the> improbable name, neonicotinoids. Neonicotinoids are a group of insecticides> chemically similar to nicotine. They act on the central nervous system of> insects. But also on bees and small song birds.

But countries like Britain tried to block the banand government scientist Ian Boyd said: ‘Decisions on the use of neonicotinoidsmust be based on sound scientific evidence.’ He was talking about evidence toimpose the ban, not ‘sound scientific evidence’ before something is actuallyunleashed on the world. The EU agreed to impose retrictions on neonicotinoids(though not necessarily permanently) from December, 2013. Bees are disappearingat a ridiculous and highly-dangerous rate and these chemical poisons damage thebrains of bees; but there is no evidence to justify taking the cautiousapproach. It is another form of insanity. Sydney Cameron, an entomologist at theUniversity of Illinois, led a threeyear study of eight species in the UnitedStates which found they had declined by up to 96 percent and the locations wherethey were found reduced by between 23 and 87 percent. Bees are in seriousdecline elsewhere in the world with 25 bee species now extinct in the UnitedKingdom and the rest reduced by up to 70 percent since the 1970s. Bees areanother casualty of the lunatic pesticide aircraft-spraying in the United Statesusing the excuse of eradicating mosquitoes which are said to carry the West Nilevirus. They either introduce a virus, take advantage of one that has occurrednaturally, or simply lie, and so justify the spraying of land and civilian areaswith deadly poisons which kill bees, bats, fish, many other animals and insects,and potentially humans (Fig 702). Chemicals in the sprays are known brainpoisons that have also been linked to liver and kidney damage and cancer.Pathetic government officials parrot the usual mantra that the spraying is nothreat to human health while producing no evidence whatsoever to support thisclaim when all the evidence is the other way. The children of these professionalliars are often subject to the same dangers as the rest of the population, buttheir parents in government are too stupid to care. These are also the sameofficials who say that the mass die-off of bees is ‘a mystery’. On top of allthis there is no evidence that spraying is effective in stopping the West Nilevirus. New York, controlled for so long by Mayor Michael Bloomberg (RothschildZionist), sprays the population with pesticides and uses West Nile virus as oneof the excuses. A spokesman for the city’s health department said that theyspray ‘very low level pesticides’ and ‘when properly used this product poses nosignificant risks to human health’. Definition of ‘significant risks’ in thesecases: ‘We haven’t got a clue what the risks could be’. Definition of ‘properlyused’: ‘Don’t open the tin’.Drink your milk – it’s good for youMonsanto contaminates cow genes with the deadly e-coli bacteria because thisproduces a hormone to increase milk yields by speeding up the metabolism. Thisso-called ‘crack for cows’, or bovine growth hormone, is injected into the cowto generate a list of health consequences both for the cows and anyone drinkingtheir milk. These include the udder infection mastitis and the production ofmore pus – yes, pus – which is mixed with the milk along with still moreantibiotics used to treat the increased infections. Bovine growth hormone alsoincreases the content in milk of a hormone called IGF-1 (Insulinlike growthfactor 1). Those with high concentrations of IGF-1 are more likely to developcancer – four times the average rate in the case of prostate cancer whilepre-menopausal women are seven times more likely to develop breast cancer. Ratesof breast cancer in the United States have leaped since the introduction of GMO.Almost all infant food formulas in the US use milk from cows treated with bovinegrowth hormone and derivatives of GMO corn, plus genetically-modified soy. TheUS government provides free formula to some two million babies, but only thegenetically-modified variety. It is eugenics under any other name. Alleged‘scientists’ in New Zealand cloned a cow to produce milk especially for babiesand in doing so managed to have it born without a tail. Okay, you have messedwith a cow’s genetics and it’s born with no tail, which is clearly in theoriginal genetic blueprint of the cow. But, hey, what do you think you are,intelligent? No, no. ‘Researchers’ at AgResearch and the University Waikato inNew Zealand said that the missing tail was ‘unlikely’ to have been caused bytheir genetic modification. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the mentality that hasbeen unleashed on your world and that of your kids and it is deciding what youeat and drink. Major meat producing companies are now using Zilmax, a drugproduced by Merck, to make cattle produce more muscle in the last weeks of theirlives. Zilmax is actually a new name for the human drug Zilpaterol which proveduseless for treating asthma and was banned for humans by the World Anti-DopingAgency. Merck just changed the name and sold it to meat producers so now peoplecan get the banned asthma drug in their dinner. How nice. Corn is such a majortarget of Big Biotech because it is in almost everything, including theappalling high-fructose corn syrup, the sugar replacement now used in everythingfrom bread to soup (Fig 703). It has been linked with obesity, cardiovasculardisease, diabetes, and liver disease. GMO now accounts for 70 percent of corn(maize) grown in the United States and 94 percent of soybeans, and GMO can alsobe found in between 70 and 75 percent of processed foods in the US. This, andmore, is what they want to impose on the entire world. They want everythinggenetically-modified. They have already tried to replace grass on golf coursesand school playing fields with GMO varieties and they want it in city parks.Genetically-modified trees are being introduced with the excuse of serving thepaper industry and they have been described as ‘the greatest threat to nativeforests since the chain saw’. The entire biology of the planet is beingrewritten. Mayor Michael Bloomberg (Rothschild Zionist), a major Archontic frontman, oversaw the use of Monsanto’s GMO-essential Roundup herbicide in New Yorkstreets and parks. Mother Jones magazine revealed in 2012 that Roundup was beingsprayed in the city some 500 times a year and how many other towns and citiesworldwide are doing the same. No wonder it can be found in the urine ofcity-dwellers. Roundup is being used on private gardens, roadsides, railways,streets, lawns and in schools. Monsanto said the latter was being done ‘toprotect schools’ when it is poisoning children who attend the schools. AnotherMonsanto herbicide, trademark name ‘Lasso’ and containing the toxin alachlor, isstill being used in the United States despite being banned in the European Unionafter a French farmer won a court case against Monsanto for suffering permanentbrain damage, loss of memory, headaches and impaired speech following theaccidental inhalation of the product. Not only does the US EnvironmentalProtection Agency still sanction its use but it only classifies alachlor astoxicity class III or ‘slightly toxic’. This is yet another example of therebeing one law for Big Biotech, which controls the EPA, and another for everyoneelse. The same applies to Big Food. An example is the intense lobbying by KraftFoods and Kemin Food Technologies that reversed a decision by the US Departmentof Agriculture (USDA) to ban three toxic meat preservatives, sodium benzoate,sodium propionate and benzoic acid which can be used to disguise low qualitymeat and poultry. The decision to lift the ban came after Kraft presented theresults of new trials funded by ... Kraft.[../Images/00101.jpg]Figure 703: GMO poses no threat to health – if you don’t eat it or go anywherenear it, or, preferably, live on another planet.The French detectionThere is now gathering scientific exposure of the lethal nature of GMO fromthose who refuse to stay quiet any longer. A peer-reviewed study by a researchteam at the University of Caen in France has revealed how it causes cancer,organ damage and premature death. It was the first study – note the first – toinvestigate the long-term effects of GMO and Monsanto’s Roundup and theresearchers found that rats exposed to even the smallest amounts ofRoundup-resistant GMO maize developed cancer and severe liver and kidney damagein a matter of months. There was a 200 to 300 percent increase in big tumoursand some were colossal (Fig 704). Half the male rats and 70 percent of femalesdied prematurely while this was the case for only 30 and 20 percent among thosein a control group that were not fed GMO poisons. Even rats given water over twoyears containing Roundup at levels permitted in human drinking water diedsignificantly earlier than rats fed on a standard diet. The Caen researchersestablished that the lowest doses of Roundup in drinking water, comfortablywithin the official limits for human consumption, caused severe healthconsequences. As I have been saying for 30 years and more – ignore the official‘safe limits’ because they are simply defined at a level that allows thecorporations to do whatever they want. They are nothing to do with safety. Thisis true of pesticides, fluoride, radiation, the lot of them. Dr MichaelAntoniou, a molecular biologist at King’s College, London, and a member of anindependent scientific council which supported the French study, said:[../Images/00280.jpg]Figure 704: Horrible cancers in mice fed a GMO diet.> This research shows an extraordinary number of tumours developing earlier and> more aggressively – particularly in female animals. I am shocked by the> extreme negative health impacts.Russia immediately announced that it was banning the import of productscontaining GMO corn, and Jose Bove, the French vice-chairman of the EuropeanParliament’s commission for agriculture, demanded an immediate ban on allgrowing and importation of GMO crops in the EU. He said:> This study finally shows we are right and that it is urgent to quickly review> all GMO evaluation processes. National and European food security agencies> must carry out new studies financed by public funding to guarantee healthy> food for European consumers.Genetically-modified crops are widely grown in North America, Brazil and Chinabut there is still great resistance in Europe. Have no doubt, however, that GMOwill be illegally infiltrating the European diet, too, on a scale that wouldlikely shock people. Given the colossal evidence already for the effect of GMOon human health it is challenging the imagination to breaking point to conceivethat Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, head of the Archonic ‘food’ giant Nestlé, actuallysaid: ‘After 15 years of eating GM food products in the USA not one single caseof illness has occurred from eating them to date.’ Extraordinary.Brabeck-Letmathe was supporting the lifting of restrictions on GMO in Europe andyou can see why when he is a big-time insider who is also on the Board ofDirectors of Credit Suisse Group, L’Oréal, and ExxonMobil, and both a member ofthe European Round Table of Industrialists and the Foundation Board of the WorldEconomic Forum. A Monsanto spokesman said of the French GMO cancer study: ‘Wewill review it thoroughly, as we do all studies that relate to our products andtechnologies.’ What a load of tosh. They did not ‘review it’, but launched acampaign to trash it. The Archontic media began running stories like ‘expertscast doubt on the findings’ No, Monsanto and GMO front people try to cast doubton the obvious truth. The two previous ‘studies’ which cleared Roundup ofdamaging health were both funded by ... Monsanto. When you heard that scientistshave said this or that always look at where they work and who funds them.Mainstream ‘science’ is full of corrupt people who will say anything for moneyand the same with politics. The soulless, heartless, bought-and-paid-for USCongress, despite this mountain of evidence, approved the ‘Monsanto ProtectionAct’ which prevents the courts from ordering the immediate suspension ofplanting and sale of GMO crops no matter what the consumer health concerns. Whocares about the health of the population when Monsanto comes to call? SenatorRoy Blunt from Missouri outrageously worked with Monsanto to draft the languagein the bill and although it provisionally lasts for only six months theprecedent is set. There is some better news elsewhere, however, in that Peru hasintroduced a ten year ban on GMO and Hungary, where genetically-modified seedsare banned, ordered that a thousand acres of unlawful GMO maize be destroyed.[../Images/00156.jpg]Figure 705: Superweeds.Superweeds 10 Roundup 0Monsanto-produced superweeds are devastating farming in the United States andaround the world exactly as planned (Fig 705). This forces people off the landand takes the world closer to the global famine that the bloodlines are workingtowards. Superweeds are those that have mutated thanks to the widespread use ofherbicides and pesticides to resist their impact. Ken Smith, a weed scientist atthe University of Arkansas, said: ‘I’ve never seen anything that had this majoran impact on our agriculture in a short period of time.’ Monsanto GMO crops havea gene that allows them to survive copious amounts of Monsanto Roundup, theworld biggest-selling herbicide, and these crops are known as ‘Roundup Ready’.They account for 94 percent of soybeans and more than 70 percent of corn andcotton grown in the United States and now here’s the punch line: superweeds havedeveloped a resistance to Roundup. Some five million hectares of the UnitedStates and closing on 130 million hectares worldwide are now covered insuperweeds. The response from the biotech crazies is to spray more powerfulherbicides and spray more often. Enjoy your dinner. This has been a trap fromthe start. Get them dependent on GMO crops which are themselves dependent onMonsanto herbicides in the knowledge that what is now happening was certain tohappen. Farmers go out of business; massive food shortages and hunger ensue; youclear the land; and you control and cull the population. These dominoentrapments are in place right across human society. Dow Chemicals have nowdeveloped GMO corn that is resistant to an ingredient found in Agent Orangewhich Dow and Monsanto supplied for the US military to kill foliage and biblicalnumbers of people during the Vietnam War. Agent Orange contaminated some tenmillion Vietnamese and 400,000 died with 500,000 suffering birth defects. Allthis continues more than 50 years after this lethal poison was unleashed onVietnam. As one article put it:> The Vietnamese exposed to the chemical suffer from cancer, liver damage,> pulmonary and heart diseases, defects to reproductive capacity and skin and> nervous disorders. Their children and grandchildren have severe physical> deformities, mental and physical disabilities, diseases and shortened life> spans.

The rivers and underground> water in some areas have also been contaminated. Erosion and desertification> will change the environment, causing dislocation of crop and animal life.Now this beyond evil Archontic biotech cartel propose to spray crops with AgentOrange chemicals which would be consumed by people in the food – and what wouldit do to wildlife? Figure 706 sums it up, really. One of the key people torebuild Monsanto’s image after the Agent Orange debacle and another involvingthe subsequently-banned PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) was Mitt Romney, the 2012presidential candidate and another jump-when-you-are-told-to Archon asset.[../Images/00085.jpg]Figure 706: There is no contradiction in this for those who are clinicallyinsane.It’s all been long planned ...Genetically-modified food began in earnest in the decades that followed DNAdiscoveries between the 1950s and 1970s which allowed scientists to gene-splicebetween species and re-wire the genetic code. The key moment came in 1980 whenthe US Supreme Court (a cabal-controlled dial-a-verdict operation) ruled inDiamond v. Chakrabarty that genetically-altered life forms can be patented. Itwas a game-changing decision that gave corporations the right to patent lifeitself so long as they had tinkered with it to some extent. Patenting life formswas unthinkable before the 20th century and indeed Article One of the USConstitution specifically excluded, for moral reasons, the patenting of ‘life’.In the 1930s plant breeders were allowed to patent seed varieties, but not tohave rights to subsequent seeds that were produced from them by the growers.Then in 1980, the bloodlines challenged these restrictions via General Electricand one of its employees, an Indian-born ‘scientist’, Dr Ananda Chakrabarty (Fig707). He developed a geneticallyengineered microbe to ‘eat’ oil slicks, which inthe end proved unusable, but that wasn’t the point. It provided a test case tobreak the blockade on the ownership of life forms. The ‘slick-eater’ was refuseda patent by the US Patent Office, but Chakrabarty made history when the USSupreme Court awarded him, by just one vote, the first patent for a life form.With that judgement the floodgates swung open. Patents followed for animals,human genes and body parts during the Reagan-Bush years with the corporationsinsisting that if they own a gene in the animal or plant, they own the animaland plant. Dan Quayle, the vicepresident to Father George Bush, announced a newdo-what-you-like policy on GMO in 1992 demanded by market-leader Monsanto whichopened the door to the Devil. Quayle justified the proposals on the grounds thatthe GMO industry would increase its worth from $4 billion a year to $50 billionby 2000 ‘if we resist the spread of unnecessary regulation’. Money was thestated reason for what was to destroy the health of a nation, but a masspeople-cull was the real motivation. An idiot and gofer like Quayle may or maynot have been too far down the food chain to realise that, but that is what allthis is really about. The revolving door between corporations like the biotechgiant Monsanto and the agencies that are supposed to police them is legendary(see Human Race Get Off Your Knees in which I provide a long list of examples).Hillary Clinton was a counsel for Monsanto when she worked for the at least thenoutrageously corrupt Rose Law firm in Arkansas, and former Monsantoattorney-turned Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas hears cases before theSupreme Court that relate directly to his former employer Monsanto (Fig 708).The most blatant example of what I would call a criminal conflict of interest isMichael R Taylor who worked for a law firm representing Monsanto and wasresponsible for introducing the corporation’s ‘food and drug law’ practices.Taylor was also Monsanto’s vice president for public policy. Intertwined withhis Monsanto roles he has been a major player in the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) and the Department of Agriculture which are officiallyregulating Monsanto and the rest of the biotech industry. Taylor has beenattorney and executive assistant to the commissioner at the FDA; administratorof the Food Safety and Inspection Service for the Department of Agriculture;senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner and then deputy commissioner for Foods atthe FDA (Fig 709). One side of the revolving door he is the poacher and theother side he is the gamekeeper; or rather isn’t. Taylor’s wife, Christine LewisTaylor, was a long-time employee of the Food and Drug Administration andpromotes the idea that nutrients should be defined as toxins to justify limitson their dosages – Agenda 21. Ms Taylor also led the delegation to the UnitedNations-sponsored Codex Alimentarius Committee on Nutrition Labelling and wasassigned by the FDA to the World Health Organization to work on ‘determiningdietary supplement safety’. What this arrogant pair have done to human health ona gargantuan scale does not bear thinking about. He manipulates the introductionof Monsanto death food and she works to ensure that dietary supplements are notpowerful enough to compensate for the lack of natural nutrients. Monsanto’sMichael Taylor was in charge of FDA labelling policy when the decision was madeto treat Monsanto GMO crops as essentially the same as non-GMO – thus notrequiring independent checks on the safety of GMO or labelling to inform peoplewhat they were buying. The FDA said: ‘We know of no information showing that thefoods created from these new methods differ in any meaningful or uniform way.’It was a big lie, a statement of sheer lunacy and mendacity, and people likeFDA/Monsanto double agent Michael Taylor knew that. A lawsuit later brought tolight 44,000 internal FDA documents which revealed that GMO can produceallergies, toxins, new diseases, antibiotic-resistant diseases, nutritionalproblems and cancer-causing agents. They also confirmed that scientists andexperts at the FDA had said that GM food was different from that producednormally and therefore had different risks. The effect on human health inGMO-soaked America has since proved potentially genocidal. One of the key peopleresponsible for taking that line was, yes, Michael Taylor, who was a partner ofthe King and Spalding law firm acting for Monsanto when he drafted a proposalfor both the company and the International Food Bio-Technology Council (IFBC) onhow GMO should be regulated. Michael Hansen, a Senior Staff Scientist at theConsumers Union, said:[../Images/00332.jpg]Figure 707: Dr Ananda Chakrabarty was used, and allowed himself to be used, toset the precedent for the ownership of life.[../Images/00355.jpg]Figure 708: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a former Monsanto attorney.[../Images/00275.jpg]Figure 709: Michael Taylor, the very personification of conflict of interest.> If you look at the proposal that was drafted for IFBC that was Michael> Taylor’s with the one that was published [by the FDA], it was very, very> similar – so if he didn’t write it, it looks like somebody took what he wrote> and changed it slightly for the policy.James Maryanski, Biotechnology Coordinator at the FDA from 1985 to 2006, saysthat Michael Taylor was the force behind the FDA policy which included howgenetic engineering and bovine growth hormones would be dealt with. All thismust have cost the lives of multiple millions of people and animals since thenand caused suffering to untold numbers who have had their health devastated byGMO. Taylor at the FDA ensured that Monsanto’s genetically-engineered bovinegrowth hormone (rbGH/rbST) could be injected into cows to increase milkproduction without any labelling for people to make a choice. He even wrote apaper saying that if producers of milk without the growth hormone labelled theirmilk as such they should be mandated to include a disclaimer from the FDA sayingthat there was no difference between milk with bovine growth hormone and milkwithout it. Taylor has been described as possibly being responsible for ‘morefood-related illnesses and deaths than anyone in history’. This man should be injail but instead he was appointed by Obama to be his ‘food safety czar’ incharge of all United States food safety policy at the FDA and senior ‘advisor’to the commissioner of the FDA. Taylor’s policy is Monsanto’s policy and therecan be no greater confirmation that corporations control governments thanTaylor’s career with Monsanto and government agencies which are officially thereto protect the public from Monsanto. This is why Big Biotech is gettingvirtually all that it wants from the FDA while organic farmers and growers andsmall farms in general are being destroyed by a mass of new and draconian lawson the grounds of ‘food safety’ imposed by FDA SWAT teams made up of goons withguns in their hands and air in their heads. Food fascism isn’t coming – it’shere. Monsanto is responsible, thanks to Taylor and the FDA, for ensuring itsown GMO poisons are safe and not the government ‘public protection’ agencies.Michael Taylor is behind the Food Safety Modernization Act which is claimed tobe making American food the safest in the world (no, it doesn’t ban GMO), butthe whole deal is aimed at (a) making life even tougher for small farmers andgrowers with 1200 pages of new regulations and (b) to kill all the nutrients andgood bacteria in food in the name of killing bad bacteria. The bill is going topush a lot of independents and organic farmers over the edge and out of businesswhich is exactly what Monsanto operative Taylor is seeking to do.No, it can’t be ... Bill’s back – againNot content with imposing GMO on Americans, Michael Taylor wants everyone toenjoy the benefits of death by food. He was a senior fellow at the think-tankResources for the Future where he published two reports on aid for Africanagriculture (so beloved of the outrageous Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation).Both of Taylor’s reports were bankrolled by the Rockefeller Foundation. Two ofthe major funders of Resources for the Future reported in fiscal year 2010 werethe Environmental Protection Agency (see FDA, same deal) and the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation. Researcher Isabella Kenfield said in an article atCounterpunch.org:> The ‘penultimate draft’ of Taylor’s 2002 paper was reviewed by Dr. Robert> Horsch, a Monsanto executive for more than 25 years, who left in 2006 to work> at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It states, ‘The ultimate concern of> this report is how innovative seed technology derived from patented tools of> biotechnology can be developed and disseminated for the benefit of small-scale> and subsistence African farmers.’Decoded: How we can help Monsanto do to Africa what is has already done toAmerica. The big sell is that without GMO the world and especially in thepoorest countries will not to be able to feed themselves when the opposite isthe case. GMO requires incredible amounts of herbicides and pesticides whichdestroy the fertility of the land and cumulatively poison the public. Insectsand fungus mutate to overcome the poisons and so more powerful toxins are beingintroduced. One of the project funders working with Monsanto is ... the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation. Microsoft generates the billions and some of this isused to fund facet after facet of the global agenda that I have been exposingfor nearly a quarter of a century. The Gates Foundation and the RockefellerFoundation launched an organisation called AGRA to ‘build a sustainable futurefor Africa’. Here we go. They want to increase yields (better introduce GMOthen?) and make a better life for African farmers. Among their compassionate,loving, caring, empathetic partners in this death sentence are Monsanto,Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Procter and Gamble, Merck, Mosaic,Pfizer, Sumitomo Chemical and Yara. Yep, these biotech and pharmaceuticalcorporations are the champions of the poor, needy and downtrodden and, ofcourse, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is spending billions onvaccination programmes in Africa and other parts of the world with the productsof these same people. Who is this Bill Gates and his missus? Why do they supportverbally and with great sums of money all these pillars of the global conspiracyand Agenda 21? The Community Alliance for Global Justice pointed out that‘Monsanto has a history of blatant disregard for the interests and well-being ofsmall farmers around the world... [This] casts serious doubt on the [Gates]foundation’s heavy funding of agricultural development in Africa ... ‘Gates owns500,000 shares in Monsanto worth tens of millions of dollars and has filmedcommercials promoting Monsanto’s GMOs as the ‘solution’ to world hunger (Fig710). These claims continue despite a farmer committing suicide in India aboutevery half an hour because of failing GMO crops and the impossible cost ofbuying Monsanto products essential to GMO. But never mind – think of all theland that will be cleared of people (Fig 711). Monsanto GMOs are made to workonly with Monsanto herbicide Roundup (glyphosate) and are said to be ‘Roundupready’. This gives Monsanto control of both the crops and the poisons requiredto be used with the crops and how are small farmers supposed to cope with thosecosts? The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science andTechnology for Development which involves some 900 scientists researching worldhunger, concluded in the 2009 report ‘Failure to Yield’ that GMO crops don’tproduce increased yields in the longer term and yet cost far more to grow andpose fundamental dangers to the environment and health. No matter, Bill Gatesand Big Biotech, supported by the governments and the mainstream media, say thatthey do because it suits their agenda. The Gates’ Foundation also has a milkdeal going with Monsanto while the government-corporation alliance makes war onraw milk producers. Gate’s real game with regard to Africa was revealed in July2012 when it was announced that his Foundation was donating £6.4 million (morethan $10 million at the time) to a British company to develop GMO crops forsub-Saharan Africa. This is what all the ‘we want to help African farmers’propaganda is all about. Professor Giles Oldroyd from the Gates-funded JohnInnes Centre said the project was vital for poorer producers and could have a‘huge impact’ on global agriculture: ‘We believe ... we can ... deliver muchhigher yields to farmers in Africa and allow them to grow enough food forthemselves.’ Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before, mate. Is it ‘vital forpoorer farmers’? Nonsense – the opposite.[../Images/00067.jpg]Figure 710: Gates and me should stop meeting like this. People will talk.[../Images/00059.jpg]Figure 711: GMO has brought catastrophe for Indian farmers.Reality checkI’ll just drop in here a reminder of the Monsanto mentality that we are dealingwith, you know the one that talks about GMOs being safe and only wanting toexpand them into Africa and across the world because it cares about feeding thehungry. Monsanto bought the company in the 1930s that invented the now-bannedpolychlorinated biphenyls, a group of 209 different chemicals known as PCBs thatkilled or devastated the health of everything with which they came intosignificant contact. They were used for cooling, insulating, and lubricatingelectrical equipment and many other uses. Monsanto, being Monsanto, beganpouring this deadly substance into creeks and open-pit landfills, including acreek in a poor area of Anniston, Alabama where children swam and locals caughtfish. An investigation by the Anniston Star also revealed that Monsanto dumped40 to 50 tons of mercury into storm sewers. Monsanto managers discovered in 1966that fish in a creek were dying in seconds, spurting blood and shedding theirskin ‘as if dunked into boiling water’. They decided that it was in the bestinterests of Monsanto to say nothing to the public and those who swam in thecreek and ate the fish caught there. Three years later they found fish inanother creek with 7,500 times the legal PCB levels (which would have been fartoo high anyway when the safe limit was zero). Once again Monsanto decided‘there is little object in going to expensive extremes in limiting discharges’.So families went about their lives without knowing that the water, soil and airin their neighbourhoods were contaminated with lethal poison. Sylvester Harris,63, a local undertaker, said he always thought that he was burying too manyyoung children – ‘I knew something was wrong around here.’ Monsanto told SierraMagazine in the 1990s that they had ‘never concealed any hazard of PCBs’ whenthat is exactly what they were doing. Remember this when they say that GMOs aresafe and essential to feeding the world. They lie by reflex action because theyare an expression of the inversion and deceit that is Archontic evil. The wordevil is most appropriate because it is the inversion of the word live. Monsantowas later exposed in 1969 for instructing ‘a committee the company formed toaddress controversies about PCBs’ that it had only two objectives: To ‘permitcontinued sales and profits’ and to ‘protect [the] image of . . . thecorporation’. Crikey, what a challenge. An internal memo said: ‘We can’t affordto lose one dollar of business.’ Monsanto then covertly decided that any writteneffluent level reports on PCBs would be kept confidential by the technical staffand would not be available to the public until or unless Monsanto decided torelease it. This policy of silence continued for decades and goodness knows howmany people died or suffered debilitating illness as a result. Then in 1993 alocal angler caught deformed largemouth bass and the alarm was raised althoughnot by Monsanto. It had taken 27 years for the truth to come out after Monsantorealised what its pollution was doing to people and wildlife. Resident DavidBaker said:> Today, parts of Anniston are so contaminated that residents have been told not> to grow vegetables in the soil, kick up dirt, eat food, chew gum or smoke> cigarettes while working in their yards. ‘Our children have to play in the> streets, on the sidewalks, because they can’t play in the grass because it’s> contaminated. We have to wear masks if we cut our grass. Where else in the> United States of America are people doing that?Dr David Carpenter, a professor of environmental health at the State Universityof New York in Albany, said: ‘In my judgment, there’s no question this is themost contaminated site in the US.’ Monsanto was fined $700 million in 2002 afterthey were found guilty of ‘negligence, wantonness, suppression of truth,nuisance, trespass, and outrage’ ... and behaviour ‘so outrageous in characterand extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency so as to beregarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in civilized society’. Even thenMonsanto would not admit to any wrongdoing. The Archontic General Electric alsodumped an estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson River from 1946until 1977 when they were banned. The quote from the Monsanto court case shouldbe printed on every Monsanto product and added as a rider to every companystatement of any kind whatsoever: ’So outrageous in character and extreme indegree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency so as to be regarded asatrocious and utterly intolerable in civilized society.’These are the peopletelling you that GMOs are safe and that all restrictions on them should belifted worldwide and this is the company so promoted by Bill Gates who owns500,000 of their shares. This is the same Bill Gates promoting Agenda 21education, vaccines across the world, the cashless society, geoengineering, andthe climate change hoax. The World Economic Forum held every year in Davos,Switzerland, is a more open version of the Bilderberg Group and attended bypretty much the same crowd including Konrad Otto-Zimmermann of the InternationalCouncil of Local Environmental Initiatives. This is the main coordinator ofAgenda 21. The Forum produced a report entitled Realizing a New Vision forAgriculture — A Roadmap for Stakeholders. I would have thought that, in theinterests of accuracy, the report should have been called Realizing a New Visionfor the Exploitation, Devastation and Colonisation of Africa by Using the Excuseof Caring Compassionately About Poor African Farmers — A Roadmap forStakeholders to Make a Killing and Grab the Land for Agenda 21. I know it’s notsnappy and catchy, but it has the benefit of telling the truth and maybe I couldpersuade Bill Gates to write the foreword. I need say no more than list the‘stakeholders’ in this outrage: Archer Daniels Midland, BASF, Bunge, Cargill,Coca-Cola Company, DuPont, General Mills, Kraft Foods, Metro, Monsanto, Nestlé,PepsiCo, SABMiller, Syngenta, Unilever, Walmart Stores and Yara International.Ahh, big old softies and compassionate kind hearts right down to theirbutter-wouldn’t-melts. The conference included representatives from Cargillwhich was sued by the International Labor Right Fund along with Nestlé andArcher Daniels Midland for alleged involvement in the trafficking, torture andforced labour of Mali children working as slaves on farms in the Ivory Coast.The suit said that children were forced to work twelve to fourteen hours a daywith no pay, little food and sleep, and endured frequent beatings. ‘Rock star’Bono is another Monsanto (remember Anniston) supporter who helps them with hisalleged credibility as a campaigner for justice in Africa although thisstreet-cred is now dissolving like snow in the sunlight after his years of mateycosiness with the very people who are bent on destroying Africa in a frenzy ofre-colonisation through land acquisition (Agenda 21). This is what Monsanto andtheir like are doing including Cargill Inc., the biggest privately-ownedcorporation in the United States in terms of revenue. This Internet commentatorhad Bono well sussed:> I am seriously about to destroy my U2 albums because this guy has turned into> a complete ass. He’s now supporting Monsanto, okay?

Look atIndia you idiots. Do you want to do that to Africa? Monsanto and Gates talkabout a new ‘Green Revolution’ in Africa when the last one in Asia was a humandisaster. Africa’s ‘Green Revolution’, so supported by Gates and theRockefellers, stresses the need for commercial farming and world markets;imported seed; and pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers. Throw in GMO for goodmeasure because that is lurking in the background all the time. Monsanto andGates are part of a global web of bloodline organisations working together underthe coordination of the Rothschild-created-and-controlled World Bank which, withits Rothschild controlled-and-created side-kick, the International Monetary Fund(IMF), has caused death and destruction across the poorest regions of the worldand opened the door for acquisition by the Archon corporations. A World Bankconference to discuss African agriculture in January 2011 was hosted by RobertZoellick (Rothschild Zionist), the bank’s president at the time, and part of theneocon group behind Boy Bush which orchestrated the invasions of Afghanistan andIraq. Zoellick is a former vicechairman of the Rothschild Zionist Goldman Sachswhich is to banking what Monsanto is to biotech. They are to Africa what Pol Potwas to human life.[../Images/00422.jpg]Figure 713: Exactly.Don’t let them chooseMonsanto, Big Biotech and Big Food have spent tens of millions to preventAmericans even knowing which foods are GMO and which are not in a campaign toblock the mandatory labelling of GMO products. There can be only one reason forthis and that is the knowledge of how many people would reject GMO if they weregiven the choice (Fig 713). GMO food is a continuation of the Archon geneticmanipulation of the human body and this is why they don’t want labelling oreventually any alternative. The modified DNA in what is consumed is transferredto human DNA and that is what they are desperate for us not to realise andtherefore avoid those consequences. When the state of Vermont was about vote formandatory labelling of GMO products in 2012 the bully-boys at Monsantothreatened to sue and the legislators backed off despite four separate opinionpolls recording that more than 90 percent of Vermont residents wanted the law togo through. Welcome to Agenda 21 when corporations completely rule your lifeunless we stand up and refuse to take this. The Archon corporations dideverything they could to block the right of people to know what is in their foodbecause they are anti-choice and anti-life. Think about what that says aboutwhere we are. Corporations spends millions to deny people the ability to knowwhat is in the food they are eating, when that food has beengenetically-modified in ways that make it impossible to know what the fullconsequences are going to be for human health, but clearly we already knowenough to see that it is potentially genocidal in its scale. The appallingAmerican giant retailer Walmart announced in 2012 that it would sell MonsantoGMO products without allowing their customers to make a free choice throughlabelling even though the crops they are selling include chemicals inside thecorn. Who shops most at Walmart? Poor people. Walmart representative Dianna Geetold the Chicago Tribune: ‘After closely looking at both sides of the debate andcollaborating with a number of respected food safety experts, we see noscientifically validated safety reasons to implement restrictions on thisproduct.’ Total claptrap. It is not being labelled because the Archon bloodlineswant people to consume geneticallymanipulated food that will genetically-modifythem and ultimately kill them. End of story. The public vote in California onNovember 6th 2012 was on the following proposition, known as Proposition 37,which called for:> • Labelling of all raw or processed food from plants or animals if genetically> manipulated in specified ways.> • Ban the labelling of such foods – wait for it – as ‘natural’ as they> currently do.Nothing is shocking to me anymore, but that gets close. Monsanto also had to bestopped through a lawsuit from calling lethal Roundup ‘biodegradable’, claimingthat it was ‘safer than table salt’, ‘practically nontoxic’ and could be ‘usedwhere kids and pets play’. The Archontic mind has no shame. Even if Proposition37 had been passed it would have exempted small amounts of genetically-modifiedmaterial from animals fed or injected with GMO so long as they were notgenetically-engineered themselves. Monsanto and the other corporate opponents ofProposition 37 had to pull a campaign television advertisement because ofblatant misrepresentation. You mean Monsanto didn’t tell the truth? Theydescribed one of their opinion-for-sale contributors as ‘Dr. Henry I. Miller MD,Stanford University, founding director FDA Office of Technology’, when he wasactually a ‘research fellow’ (which means nothing in effect) of the HooverInstitution (see some of my other books) and only has an office on the Stanfordcampus. This is the same Henry Miller who has been a ‘scientist’ advocate forBig Tobacco, Big Oil and Big Biotech and has called for the use of the deadlypesticide DDT which is so bad it has even been banned in the United States since1972. Miller has said that ‘lowlevel’ radiation from catastrophes like Fukushimacould be good for you. If he had not been born Monsanto would have had toconstruct him. Funders of the Hoover Institution have included the agribusinessgiant Archer Daniels Midland, JPMorgan, Exxon, Proctor and Gamble and otherbastions of truth, justice and the best interests of the people. Campaignorganisations against Proposition 37, funded by the likes of Monsanto, brokefelony law by misusing a government seal of the Food and Drug Administrationalongside a made-up quote which said: ‘The US Food and Drug Administration saysthat labeling policy like Prop 37 would be “inherently misleading”’. But a fakequote isn’t? The consequences for the misuse of a government seal for whichothers have faced big fines and even jail sentences was, of course, zilch.Anyway, all this skulduggery, misrepresentation and the five-to-one financialadvantage of $9 million plays $46 million led to Proposition 37 being rejectedby 6,442,371 votes to 6,088,714 although there were questions asked about thefairness of the voting system. It is testament to the current mental state of somuch of the human race that officially 6,442,371 adults in California votedagainst knowing what they are eating. I will just sit quietly for a moment,breathe deeply and I will be back with you shortly (Fig 714). It was also notedthat US ‘organic food’ giant Whole Foods took a long time to come out againstProposition 37 and never contributed a cent to the ‘no’ campaign despite highprofits. This is the same Whole Foods that has been exposed for selling productswith GMO ingredients while staff and advertising say otherwise. Their claim tosell ‘Nothing Artificial Ever’ is simply not true with products containing GMOfor sale on the shelves. Whole Foods said it was company policy not to donate to‘political’ campaigns (wanting your food labelled is political?), but at thesame time Whole Foods executives have given financial support to theMonsanto-promoting Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and others. Whole Foods was stungby the public reaction to it selling GMO-contaminated food and its failure togive serious support to Prop 37 and the company announced in 2013 that it wouldrequire GMO labelling on products sold in its stores by 2018 which is aridiculously long lag time. The term ‘organic’ does not ensure that the food isorganic, only that it is claimed to be, which can sometimes be quite anotherstory. Mike Adams at Naturalnews.com ran an excellent article headed ‘“Organic”from China exposed: The shocking truth about “organic” foods grown in theworld’s worst environmental cesspool.’ The thrust of the article is obvious –‘organic products’ from polluted regions of China has to be a contradiction interms with rivers that are deadly to bathe in and one in four Chinese peopledying from cancer . This is an 80 percent increase in the 30 years of industrial‘boom’ based on slave labour and virtually non-existent environmental laws. Ifever there was a landscape that said ‘Archon’ it is China (Fig 715). Adams alsorevealed that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) sets ‘organic standards’with no limits on levels of contamination by mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic,aluminium and synthetic chemicals which are allowed in foods, superfoods andsupplements certified organic. He wrote:[../Images/00292.jpg]Figure 714: One of those who voted against Proposition 37.> At this point, you’re probably shaking your head in disbelief and thinking,> ‘No, that can’t be true. Organic standards must check for heavy metals and> chemical contamination, right?’ No! ‘Organic’ certifies a process of how food> is grown or produced. It certifies that the farmer doesn’t add pesticides,> herbicides, petroleum-based fertilizer, metals or synthetic chemicals to the> crop (among other things), and it certifies that the soil must be free from> such things for a certain number of years before organic certification is> approved.[../Images/00034.jpg]Figure 715: China – perfect environment for growing healthy food.> But organic certification does nothing to address environmental sources of> pollution such as ... contaminated irrigation water, and fallout from> industrial or chemical factories that might be nearby. A certified organic> farmer can use polluted water on their crops and still have the crops labeled> ‘organic.’ For this reason: the environment in which organic foods are> produced is critical to the cleanliness of the final product.> Organic farming in a clean environment produces clean, organic foods. But> organic farming in a polluted environment produces contaminated organic foods.> And China is one of the most polluted chemical cesspools on the planet.This does not mean that all organic food is contaminated in this way, absolutelynot, and it cannot lawfully contain pesticides, herbicides and other toxins fromthe production process (except from China clearly) which is a major improvementon nonorganic industrial foodstuffs. But the point is that the USDA regulationsallow it to be legally contaminated by external pollutants which ‘organic food’from China is pretty much bound to be. Mike Adams says that ‘the vast majorityof superfood powders sold in North America use raw materials purchased in bulkfrom China’ while nutritional supplements, herbs and vitamins are often madeusing materials from China. The Archontic networks don’t want people eatingclean organic food and they seek to block that in every way they can. Peopleshould also appreciate that just because a company claims to sell organic and be‘green’ does not mean it isn’t just as corrupt and lacking integrity as oneselling shite and sludge. These companies source from China despite thecontamination because it is much cheaper. They are just as money-driven as therest of the food and ‘earth’ industry and by going to China purely for cheapnessthey are driving genuine organic producers in the US, Europe and elsewhere outof business. By the way, talking of China, a common ingredient of bread calledL-cysteine, which is also found pizza dough and pastries, is largely sourcedfrom human hair swept up off the floors of Chinese hair salons. Fancy asandwich? Far more non-organic food is being imported from China than widelybelieved and this has been frequently found to contain ‘unapproved chemicals,dyes, pesticides and outright fraud (fake food)’, according to Mark A Kastel,Senior Farm Policy Analyst at The Cornucopia Institute, in evidence to a USHouse Committee. Kastel said: ‘We don’t trust, for good reason, the Chinese tosupply ingredients for our dog and cat food. Why should we trust Chineseexporters for the food that we are feeding our children and families?’ Humanityis being systematically and cumulatively poisoned through the food supply.Media madnessAnother aspect of the population cull is to deny people alternatives toArchontic food and medicine until they are too weak to resist the takeover. Younow regularly see attacks by ‘scientific studies’ on organic food – includingthe breathtaking one in 2012 when ‘scientists’ announced through a compliant andunquestioning media that eating organic food is basically no healthier thaneating food infested with pesticides, herbicides and all the other toxins (Fig716). Or, at least, that is the way the media presented the findings worldwide.No food is without contamination today, but if you stay away from Chinesesources the idea that industrially-produced food is no different to organic iscertifiable surely? Plus, in terms of nutrition, organic corn has been found tohave 7 times more manganese, 56 times more magnesium and 437 times more calciumthan GMO. Harry Wallop, a ‘journalist’ on the London Daily Telegraph, reportedthe ridiculous ‘no difference’ propaganda with glee and confessed that he hadlong lied to his wife that the local store had run out of organic milk tojustify him bringing home non-organic. Wally, sorry Wallop, ended his article bysaying: ‘Tomorrow, the baby is going to get an extra dollop of pesticide-sprayedcarrots.’ I know, you lose the will to live; but this is the mentality that sooften stands between what goes on the world and what these people tell us isgoing on. The ‘findings’ that equated food with poisons with food with far lessor no poisons came from the Stanford Center for Health Policy, a subsidiary ofStanford’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies which isfinancially supported by, among others, agricultural giant Cargill and the Bill& Melinda Gates Foundation, which is closely connected to Cargill and Monsanto.Other donors include Goldman Sachs, BP, Google and a stream of other bloodlinecorporations and foundations. The ‘study’ must have been completely independentthen. Cargill are among the corporations promoting genetically-modified food andopposing efforts to have it labelled as such. One of the lead ‘researchers’ inthis outrageous misrepresentation of organic food was Dr Ingram Olkin whocollaborated with the tobacco industry to misdirect people into believing thatsmoking was not a danger to health. The Stanford ‘research’ (bollocks) wassystematically used by the global media to attack the truth that organic foodwithout pesticides is healthier than food full of poisons and to mock andridicule those who wish to eat healthier food. It was quite obviously allcoordinated. Wallop on the Telegraph in the UK had a mirror image in RogerCohen, a columnist with The New York Times. He attacked what he termed ‘theorganic fable’ and described organics as an ‘ideology’ and akin to apseudoscientific cult. Cohen also either lied, or was not intelligent enough toread the report he promotes, when he said the study had found that ‘organic foodwas not less likely to be contaminated by dangerous bacteria like E.coli.’ Itactually said that organic meats had significantly lower levels ofantibiotic-resistant bacteria. But the real reason for this coordinated attackon organics and those that choose to eat healthier food was encapsulated in thissingle paragraph in Cohen’s article:[../Images/00276.jpg]Figure 716: This is no worse for health than eating food without the toxic crap.It must be true, special interest groups and idiot journalists say so. I blamethe food additives.> To feed a planet of 9 billion people, we are going to need high yields not low> yields; we are going to need genetically modified crops; we are going to need> pesticides and fertilizers and other elements of the industrialized food> processes that have led mankind to be better fed and live longer than at any> time in history.Was that written in The New York Times or Monsanto News? My goodness, it is soblatant. The claim that the world can only be fed with genetically-modified foodis not only a lie, it is the very opposite of the truth. GMO is leading theworld down the road to starvation by destroying the soil and the diversity ofseed varieties, and with the socalled terminator seeds that are useless afterone planting. What happens when only a few GMO varieties are left and somethinghappens to destroy them or their production? Mass global starvation. Monsanto’sRoundup/glyphosate, so essential to GMO, has also been identified as a cause forthe dramatic decline in vital soil bacteria which threatens the very fertilityof the land and its ability to produce food. Anyone think, in the face of thetidal wave of evidence, that this is not the idea? Naturalnews.com awarded Cohenits Idiot of the Year Award which is a major feat given the competition. Thewebsite’s Mike Adams wrote:> With this editorial, the New York Times is saying that all consumers who buy> organic products have a mental disorder. It’s probably only a matter of time> before people who buy organics are ‘detained’ at psychiatric hospitals for 72> hours of ‘observation’ during which you will be forcefed chemical medications.> They’re already doing this to U.S. veterans who question the political> leadership of America, by the way.> According to Roger Cohen of the New York Times, only the people who eat> pesticides and GMOs have brains that work correctly.

It’s ‘scientific’ to want to> eat poison! All you morons who want clean food are delusional, Cohen insists!It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.Stealing the seeds and owning your bodyAnother ‘front’ in the assault on food freedom is to dramatically reduce theamount of seed varieties available and patent those that remain. Bloodlinecorporations have been patenting seed varieties that cannot be used withoutpaying them a royalty and Monsanto has been patenting natural varieties of seedsthat they have had nothing to do with them. Staggering, but true. It isoutrageous, of course, and beyond belief that this is allowed, but when theauthorities are in your back pocket anything goes. Monsanto is one of the mostimportant corporations in the bloodline stable and is another that gives evil abad name. It illegally introduced GM crops to Brazil and has spent the last wellover a decade illegally charging farmers a two percent production tax, plusother royalties on seeds that they insist must only be used for a singleplanting and then repurchased. Jane Berwanger, a lawyer representing theBrazilian farmers, said: ‘The law gives producers the right to multiply theseeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay (again).Producers are in effect paying a private tax on production.’ Monsanto lost thecase, but has appealed. The company has introduced what are known as ‘terminatorseeds’ or ‘suicide seeds’ which can only be used for one planting and then haveto be bought again. These are replacing the system used by farmers for thousandsof years of using seeds from one season to produce the seeds for the next. GMTerminator seeds are destroying small family farming because once a farmerbreaks the natural cycle by using them the price is increased until it isunaffordable. Bloomberg reported in 2009 alone that Monsanto, the world’sbiggest seed-maker, was increasing the price of new genetically-modified seedsby a massive 42 percent. This is doing what? Driving people off the land and thenumber of suicides by farmers when they face ruin in countries like India isabsolutely shocking. Some 250,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide, mainlyin the GMO cotton belt, because of the devastating debt the Monsanto and the GMOsystem left them with. More land for the corporations to pick off. Monsanto,with great support from Bill Gates and company, are seeking to expand the reachof this people-destroyer across the developing (or rather not) countries of theworld. The plan is to own and control everything worldwide including the humanbeing which, in their context, comes under the heading of a ‘resource’.Corporations are now claiming that in law any genetic engineering means thatthey own that body-type be they animals or humans. Andrew Kimbrell, executivedirector of the Center for Food Safety, said: ‘It actually means givingcorporations, incredibly, the power to own and control species of the earth.’Think about this, too. If they claim, as they do, that they own any life-formthat has been subject to their genetic tinkering then that means they own theright to reproduce them. I know it is insane, but these people are insane andthey are running our world. The plan has been to delete as many varieties offood as possible and patent what is left so that they literally own the foodchain and the rights to production and distribution, and the same with water.Did you know that already 97 percent of vegetable varieties grown at the startof the 20th century are now no more? Or that of the 5,000 varieties of potatoonce grown worldwide there are now only four grown on any scale? This is their‘biodiversity’ is it? You will find a similar trend with every other foodstuffthat comes from the soil. This monoculture puts the very existence of food indanger because if something comes to destroy the few varieties left, that’s it(Fig 717). This is what happened in Ireland in the 19th century when potatoblight struck the few varieties in use and million people died of starvation.The use of pesticides and herbicides have also produced ‘super bugs’ that havemutated to survive or even feed off that which formally killed them. I waspredicting this in my days in the Green Party because it was so obvious and nowit’s happening. What is their solution? To spray more and more powerful poisonson food and take the mutation process to an even higher level of resistance.What then? A report by the California Policy Seminar, a joint program of theuniversity and state government, said:[../Images/00316.jpg]Figure 717: Monoculture Earth – courtesy of the Archons’ monomind.> As a result of these practices worldwide, the number of resistant pests is> growing exponentially, the authors point out. According to recent biological> research, the number of insects and mites that have become resistant to> chemicals since 1950 is up 10-fold, from less than 50 species to more than> 450.You will see, until we stop it, the continuing attacks on small farmers andgrowers and the right to privately grow food in any circumstance and the excusesand covert manipulation to drive people from the land and seize control of allfood, water and resources. It is called Agenda 21 with pseudonyms likesustainable development and biodiversity. Billionaire financier and bloodlineinsider George Soros (Rothschild Zionist) has been buying farmland and grainstorage companies with a vengeance in the United States and Australia through acompany called Gavilon. This is all connected to food control and removingpeople from the land.What it’s all aboutThe organic-inorganic-genetic-mutation manipulation has a much greaterperspective, however. The Archons were described by the Gnostic texts asinorganic and what we call robotic and computer-like. What we are seeing is theArchons and their bloodlines destroying the organic and genetic variety of theEarth and making it ever more like their own mono-reality. I hear people ask whythese El-lite families would destroy the planet that they and their successorshave to live on, but it is not like that. They are servants of the hiddenArchontic Control System which is seeking to make the Earth habitable for themby changing the nature of its frequency, environment and atmosphere. ArchonMonsanto and other expressions of Big Biotech are taking vibrant, living seedvarieties out of circulation and replacing them with a next to dead GMOmonoculture for this reason. The destruction of the rain forests is all tiedinto this. Look at what the El-lite have done to a once living Earth with theirchemical factories, nuclear power stations, road systems and sprawling cities ofconcrete and tarmac. The beautiful Earth is being turned into the land of theArchons. I said earlier that the Matrix – the reality that we think is real – isa bad copy or download of the original universe; but bad copy as it is it was abad copy of how the universe is meant to be. There were still lots of goodthings about it and there was still beauty, life and energetic vibrancy. Oncethe Matrix copy had hacked into human collective perception the process began ofchanging the copy of the universe into a version of the Archon reality – one inwhich they could operate openly both vibrationally and atmospherically. Thisprocess is now reaching an ever more advanced stage and that is why we have GMOand geoengineering of the planet’s atmosphere which I will be addressing. Thehijacking of Saturn and its artificial rings are another example of the copybeing further distorted to serve the Archon grand design. GMO is targeting RNAwhich writes the human body program – change RNA and you change DNA – and alsogoing directly to DNA in league with all the technological toxins which bombardthe body from all directions from food and drink to sugar to vaccines. Thesetoxins and elements of GMO are designed to get into the body under the radar ofthe immune system which doesn’t recognise them and they can mutate theRNA/DNA/genetic information fields by attaching rogue information to them. Wemay see on one side the genetic structure and on the other food additives,vaccines, drugs, sugar and GMO, but in their base state they are all informationfields and one impacts upon the other. The potential for this to completelytransform the human species if you know what you are doing is limitless. It canswitch genes on and off, and therefore what they do goes on and off; it canimplant and manipulate information to program how long someone will live and howlong future generations of that genetic line will life; it can program whatdiseases people will or will not get and when; it can activate or silence brainfunctions and emotional response. This is what is happening as they work towardsthe fully-controlled, fullyautomated, genetically-designed super slaves. This ishappening in the realms of the biological disciplines known as epigenetics andphylogenetics.It is my view that the energetic distortion from which the Demiurge/Archonsmanifest is being impregnated into the human body energy field through thedistortions that we call food additives, vaccines, GMO and radiation. They areall expressions of the prime distortion – the Archons – and it allows forgreater possession and influence of the human species for those locked away inBody-Mind. This is one prime reason why we live in an environment today awashwith toxins wherever you look and whatever you eat, drink, breathe and touch."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00069.jpg]Mass ToxicityWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.Oscar WildeAnother frontline in the war on human health and perception is to poison usthrough food, drink and the water supply. This is already well advanced with allthe chemical cocktails that we call ‘food’ today and the acidic, body-rotting,sugar-sodden sodas and other drinks. These are distorting thereceiver-transmission systems to lock people away in the perception box orbubble while adding to genetic mutation and the mass cull.The term ‘poison’ is no exaggeration when we are talking about non-organic food.Chemical infested food is the norm today – check almost any label in asupermarket. We have the rapid growth in genetically-modified food; crops aresoaked with pesticides and herbicides and the residues remain in the food wheneaten; animals are given antibiotics and growth hormones which are consumed bythe public and the latter is one reason for the explosion in obesity; poisonsare added to drinking water; we breathe toxic chemical ‘air’ in the industrialregions and centres of population; vaccinations inject chemical poisons thatattack and undermine for life the immune systems of children. Put the words‘This is What Your Tap Water Looks Like’ into a search engine and, well, seewhat your tap water looks like (Fig 718). It’s horrible. Humanity is beingsystematically poisoned for goodness sake and it is in our face as well as ourmouth; but despite this obvious fact I still hear people say that there is nodifference between eating food that is full of toxins and food that is not. Howthey remember to breathe is a mystery to me.[../Images/00313.jpg]Figure 718: What a filter takes out of ‘drinking’ water.‘Aaaaaah, I am getting light-headed, I’m going blue, I’m passing out, I’m goingto die, what can I doooooo?’Breathe, mate, you’ve forgotten to breathe. Now put down thatchemically-flavoured, shite-ridden fluoridated water, sorry Diet Coke, and justkeep telling yourself: ‘I have to breathe or I die, I have to breathe or I die’.You’ll get the hang of it eventually. Most people are suffering from very highlevels of toxicity because of what they eat, drink and come into contact with.It is a sobering thought that the HAARP technology in Alaska, which bouncesradiation off the upper atmosphere and back to earth, is capable of producingenergy fields that amplify poisons and chemicals in the body to the point wherethey can be made instantly lethal by activating a process called ‘cyclotronresonance’ through which electromagnetic fields can increase the strength ofchemicals by a thousand times. What was that I said about a population cull? Anindication of where ‘food’ is going under Agenda 21 came at the Euroscience OpenForum in Dublin, Ireland in 2012. Bill Yosses, the White House executive pastrychef (see Deputy Clerk of the Closet), said that the food of the future would beentirely made from chemical concoctions. A food ‘expert’ called Herve This (yes,that’s his name, though it should surely be Serve This) is from the Frenchresearch organisation AgroParisTech. He told Ireland’s RTE News that eating realfood was like living in the Middle Ages. Exactly which asylum planet Mr This orThat hails from isn’t entirely clear, but given his aversion to ‘real food’ hislocation is perhaps in the region of the star system known as the Great Horse,the inspiration in Greek mythology for Findus ‘Beef’ Lasagne. This ‘joke’relates to the horsemeat widely discovered in British ‘beef’ products in early2013. I just wanted to lighten the atmosphere. British people need cheering upat the moment because as a result of their unintended horsemeat diet they arewalking around with a long face. A friend was advised by his doctor to watchwhat he ate and immediately bought a ticket to the Horse of the Year Show.Anyway, back to Mr This. He said:> So you have no vegetables, no fruit, no meat, no fish, nothing except> compounds. And you have to create a shape, a color, a taste, a freshness, a> pungency, an astringency, everything.Nothing new there, then.Sugar, sugar ...Here is a staggering statistic: in 1822 the average intake of added sugar nowcontained in a can of cola was consumed every five days (Fig 719). The figuretoday is ... every seven hours. Then people ask why the cases of diabetes andobesity are absolutely soaring (Fig 720). How do the authorities deal with that?They blame only the consumer and allow Coca Cola and MacDonald’s to sponsor theOlympic Games to associate their names and images with lean, fit young people.Biological scientist Dr Hans-Peter Kubis led a study at Bangor University inWales into the health consequences of soft drinks. His verdict: ‘Having seen allthe medical evidence, I don’t touch soft drinks now ... I think drinks withadded sugar are, frankly, evil.’ The study, published in the European Journal ofNutrition, found that soft drinks change metabolism and cause muscles to usesugar for energy instead of burning fat. This makes people rapidly gain weightand increases the risk of type 2 diabetes (Fig 721). A report released in 2013suggested that around 1 in 20 Britons have diabetes with cases rising by a thirdin six years. This is explained in part by the cumulative effect now kicking in.The journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention published researchthat two carbonated drinks a week appears to double the risk of pancreaticcancer and an Israeli study suggested that soft drinks with high levels of fruitjuice may cause severe long-term liver damage. Two drinks a day increased therisk by five times. Many studies have connected soft drinks to changes inbehaviour. A team at London’s University College Health Behaviour ResearchCentre tested 346 children and found that these chemical cocktails made themwant to drink more often even when they were not thirsty and the preference wasfor more sugary drinks. The researchers said they were concerned that thiscraving could stay with children for life by giving them ‘increased preferencefor sweet things’ (sugar addiction), and research at Oregon University suggestedthat children given sugary drinks tended to avoid eating raw vegetables andinstead chose food high in calories. This was not the case with the controlgroup in the research who drank water. Circulation, the journal of the AmericanHeart Association, published an investigation which tracked the health of 42,000men over 22 years. The conclusion was that men who drink a standard can of softdrink every day have a 20 percent greater risk of heart disease compared withthose who don’t. The consumption of soft drinks has doubled since 1985 despitethe evidence mounting all the time about their serious potential healthconsequences and the obesity epidemic which began in the United States (alaboratory for the Archontic networks) is now spreading worldwide (Figs 722 and723). Obese people cannot possibly be as potentially sharp-thinking and healthyas they ought to be when carrying those extremes of weight around and all thetoxicity and sugar-poison that goes with it. Nor can a body that is toxic andgenetically distorted receive and transmit information with anything like therange and breadth that it potentially could. This is the idea and onegeneration’s obesity is the next generation’s greater susceptibility to obesity.Once again they are mutating human genetics by what they produce for people toeat and drink and who produces it? The Archon corporations.[../Images/00279.jpg]Figure 719: ‘I’d like to teach the world to sing – never drink a coke.’[../Images/00347.jpg]Figure 720: Fast Food Man.[../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 721: What chance have they got when they start out like this?[../Images/00029.jpg]Figure 722: It is hardly rocket science ...[../Images/00341.jpg]Figure 723: ... to see the connection.If you try to avoid sugar by going for sugar substitutes or ‘zero sugar’ drinksthe result can be just as bad – or worse. This is the catch them which-way trapthat is sprung right across human society. Aspartame, the sugar substitute andbrainsuppressant, is in food and drink galore, especially those called ‘diet’ or‘sugar free’. It is also promoted under names such as NutraSweet, Equal,Spoonful and Equal-Measure. Aspartame was manipulated onto the market by 9/11 USDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld when he was head of Searle Pharmaceuticals inthe 1980s. Searle was rightly having problems getting approval from the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) for the public use of aspartame in the light of testsand studies that cast doubt on its safety and Rumsfeld was appointed by Searleto use his contacts in the Reagan-Bush administration to remove those blocks andunleash aspartame on the unsuspecting population. It worked. The head of the FDAwas replaced and the new one pushed through approval for aspartame. Searle wasthen sold, with the rights to aspartame, to ... Monsanto. Rumsfeld is believedto have made at least $12 million from the sale. Aspartame rights have sincebeen sold on to companies like Ajinomoto in Japan who renamed it AminoSweet.Ahhh, sounds lovely. Aspartame is actually horrendous and is sourced in morethan 75 percent of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA,according to health campaigner Dr Joseph Mercola. These include, but onlyinclude: headaches/migraines, dizziness, seizures, nausea, numbness, musclespasms, weight gain, rashes, depression, fatigue, irritability, acceleratedheart rate, heart palpitations, insomnia, vision problems, hearing loss,breathing difficulties, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, loss of taste,tinnitus, vertigo, memory loss, and joint pain. Chronic illnesses connected withaspartame include: brain tumours, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, chronic fatiguesyndrome, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, mental retardation, lymphoma, birthdefects, fibromyalgia, and diabetes (Fig 724). A study of 77,218 women and47,810 men which analysed data over 22 years concluded that a single diet(aspartame) soda per day increased the chances of leukaemia in men and women by42 percent and multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk in men by 102percent and 31 percent respectively. Aspartame is also produced withgenetically-modified bacteria and it is only one of a now fantastic array ofchemicals and potions that are added to processed food which suppress anddistort people mentally, emotionally and ‘physically’. Yet it is used inchildren’s medicines and the GMO-supporting Coca-Cola Company Beverage Institutefor Health & Wellness (Oh my god they are joking) claims aspartame is safe foruse by nearly all populations, except for those born with the genetic disorderphenylketonuria despite all the evidence to the contrary. Another one to avoidbig time is monosodium glutamate, or MSG, a so-called flavour enhancer that likeaspartame is an excitotoxin. This means they overstimulate the receptors throughwhich brain cells communicate and they become depleted and exhausted and dievery quickly. The regions of the brain most affected are the hypothalamus andtemporal lobes which relate to behaviour, emotions, sleep cycles and of courseour recurring theme, the immune system. Aspartame and MSG have been described asthe two leading causes of central nervous system damage in the United States,but the branch of Monsanto known as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)considers aspartame to be ‘safe and suitable’. The US International Dairy FoodsAssociation and the National Milk Producers Federation has petitioned the FDA toallow aspartame and other artificial sweeteners to be added to milk and otherdairy products without a label. The petition requests a change to regulations onmilk, cream and 17 other dairy products including yogurt, sweetened condensedmilk, sour cream and others to allow the adding of ‘safe and suitablesweetener’. They say that this will promote healthy eating and lower obesityespecially for children. Calm, Dave, calm.[../Images/00318.jpg]Figure 724: Drink your brain suppressant, dear, they say aspartame is good forthe complexion.Then there is the exotoxin marketed as ‘neotame’. This is merely a modified(even worse) version of aspartame and began life in the same place – Monsanto.Neotame is an even more potent chemical sugar substitute and also a ‘flavourenhancer’ (brain manipulator) which was approved by the corrupt FDA in 2002 andis now sold all over the world including Europe. The FDA decreed that eventhough it is even more toxic than aspartame it does not have to appear on USfood labels, including those for organic products when with its very presencethey would cease to be ‘organic’. This outrageous and criminal decision was madeby the FDA to the benefit of Neotame producer NutraSweet, a former division ofMonsanto, and it is an example of the next stage of this systematic poisoning ofthe human race which is to allow additives in food products without appearing onthe label to give the buyer a choice. This was another aspect of the GMOprecedent and the FDA is trying to overcome the greater public awareness that ismaking more people read the ingredients before they buy. Neotame appears onproducts in the European Union as E961 and its International Numbering System(INS) is food additive code 961. Some good advice that I saw on the Internet:Whenever you see the terms ‘sugar-free’ or ‘fat-free’ think of the words‘chemical shit-storm’. Neotame is also being fed to cattle under the name‘Sweetos’ and this is another gateway to the human organism. TheNaturalsociety.com website revealed that US farmers are feeding their cattlewith the cheapest of cheap processed foods that include cakes, chocolate andsweets or candies. The cows get fatter and so more valuable by filling them withsugar and additives. The following cocktail of shite is then passed on to theperson eating the meat ... genetically-modified, mercury-polluted highfructosecorn syrup; fake taste additive monosodium glutamate; hydrogenated oils;pesticides, herbicides and insecticides; and artificial flavourings, colouringand sweeteners – like (genetically-modified) aspartame and neotame. The Americandiet that has destroyed the health of Americans and caused epidemic obesity,cancer and diabetes is now being fed to cattle to be eaten by Americans andcause still further ill health and obesity. As someone said: ‘Whoever snuck the“s” into “fast” food was a clever bastard.’ With the public ‘protection’agencies like the FDA owned by the corporations that they should be protectingus from, the checks and balances are minimal, just as they are with Big Pharmawhich owns the health ‘protection’ agencies such as the Centers for DiseaseControl and, once again, the FDA (Fig 725). The same situation applies in Europeand elsewhere. The appalling state of mainstream food is having so many knock-oneffects mentally, emotionally and ‘physically’. There was a major scandal in theUK in early 2013 when horsemeat was found in a wide range of foods labelled‘beef’, as I mentioned, and Oceana, the non-profit ocean protection group, foundthat 59 percent of tuna tested wasn’t tuna and 87 percent of snapper wasn’tsnapper. In the case of ‘white tuna’, 84 percent was actually a fish calledescolar which can cause ‘prolonged, uncontrollable, oily anal leakage’.Apparently they call it Obama Speech Syndrome. People have no idea what is inthe food they eat and the modern human food chain is absolutely shocking. TheMcDonald’s McRib sandwich in the United States contains azodicarbonamide, aflour-bleaching agent most commonly used in foamed plastics such as in gym matsand shoe soles. Mango Mantra Light Smoothie from Jamba Juice was found tocontain 85 grams of sugar – well over twice the amount of added daily sugarrecommended by the American Heart Association and that will almost certainly betoo high, anyway. The Subway Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki Sandwich includes 520grams more salt than recommended in a day for children, African-Americans andthose with high blood pressure. It also contains the entire recommended dailyintake of sugar. Why does America and increasingly Europe have an obesityproblem, any idea? It’s a mystery to me (Fig 726). But these people get awaywith this slow-burn assassination of human health while the truly organicgrowers and health stores are targeted by the corporation-controlled government‘protection’ agencies.[../Images/00243.jpg]Figure 725: The government ‘protection agencies’ in all their forms.Rat poison in the water supply. Yep, good thinkingFluoride is a toxic waste product from the aluminium industry and yet it isadded to most drinking water in the United States. This process of poisoning thewater supply (hasn’t it already suffered enough?) continues to expand inBritain, mainland Europe and other countries like Australia (of course). Even iffluoride did as claimed help teeth (it doesn’t) we should be given a choiceabout whether we use it or not; but by adding it to water supplies that choiceis limited to seeking out supplies of bottled water or fluorideremoving filtersystems. Most people won’t do that and the Archon networks know it. Fluorideconsists of more than 100 industrial chemicals and heavy metals – much of whichcomes from China and outfits like the Fluoride Chemicals (Yunnan) company. Thisis the company’s published summary of the uses for sodium fluoride which isadded to public drinking water:[../Images/00339.jpg]Figure 726: ‘Mmmmm ... poison ... lovely.’> It is used in the manufacture of effervescing steel, and the smelting and> refining of light metals. It is also used in fluorination of drinking water,> as a wood preservative, an adhesive preservative ... an insecticide, a> protective coating for metals, a pickle for steels and other metals, a flux> for soldering and welding, as well as a flux and pacifier for ceramic, glass> and porcelain enamel.Shanghai Polymet Commodities Ltd describes its fluoride chemicals like this:[../Images/00208.jpg]Figure 727: Drink yourself stupid.> Property: Colorless, transparent and smoky liquid with penetrating odor;> highly acidic; soluble in water and volatile; with disinfecting action;> corrosive to glass, ceramics, lead and other metals; highly corrosive to human> skin and harmful to people’s respiratory organs; keep it in a container made> of plastics.Fluoride, an ingredient in rat poison, was added to drinking water in Naziconcentration camps to make the inmates docile. It suppresses brain activity –the same as aspartame and other food and drink additives (Fig 727). Anyone see apattern here? Even mainstream scientific studies are supporting this conclusion.A Harvard study lead by Anna L Choi produced results which ‘support thepossibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on children’sneurodevelopment.’ They found that ‘children in high fluoride areas hadsignificantly lower IQ than those who lived in low fluoride areas’ and thatfluoride can easily cross the placenta to the foetus and ‘may possibly lead todamage of a permanent nature’. Fluoridated water mixed with baby formula resultsin the child consuming 100 to 200 times more fluoride than found in breast milk.Dumb them down from the earliest age to turn out the dumb adult slaves of thefuture. Is it any wonder that researcher and geneticist Dr Gerald Crabtree atStanford University believes humans are losing cognitive capabilities andbecoming more emotionally unstable? Studies have found that women who avoidedfluoride had considerably fewer cases of anaemia, premature births, and babieswith low-birth-weight than women consuming fluoride. This poison was also foundto reduce red blood cells, block the production of vitamin B12 and folic acidactivity among many other adverse effects. Even the disgusting EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) has said that ‘it’s apparent that fluorides have theability to interfere with the functions of the brain’ and get this one ... cancause increased risk of tooth and bone damage. The lie about protecting teethhas been the entire justification for this mass poisoning and it was sold andpromoted into use by infamous El-lite propagandist Edward Bernays (RothschildZionist), the ‘Father of Public Relations’ and ‘The Original Spin Doctor’, whosaid that he could get anyone to do anything by manipulating their perceptions.The EPA is not banning fluoride from drinking water despite all the evidence orsending its armed SWAT teams to the water companies, suppliers and governmentdepartments that are responsible for all this. No, they are too busy terrorisingfamily farmers, growers and producers of raw milk. Oh yes, and ignoring theirown scientists about the dangers of fluoride and firing many of them when theyspeak out. These have included Dr William Marcus, chief toxicologist for theEPA’s Office of Drinking Water, who is refusing to stay silent. The claimwithout any credible evidence is that fluoride prevents tooth decay, but theexperience for many (supported by scientific studies) is the opposite with teethbeing destroyed by fluorosis (Fig 728). Sodium fluoride has also been connectedwith cancer, DNA/genetic damage and Alzheimer’s disease. Does anyone stillbelieve that brain-damaging chemicals in food, drinks and water and the soaringcases of dementia are not connected? The US Food and Drug Administration orderedthat a warning be placed on all fluoride toothpaste which says:[../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 728: Fluoride is so great for protecting teeth.> WARNING: Keep out of reach of children under 6 years of age. If you> accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional help or> contact a poison control center immediately.The fluoride content of some children’s toothpastes could kill a young child ifit was swallowed in one go and fluoride is also added to some baby formulas.Babies and toddlers are particularly in the gun-sights of the Archoncorporations because they can suppress them for life by distorting the way theydevelop from the earliest age. The Cornucopia Institute is a Wisconsin-basednon-profit farm policy research group campaigning for economic justice for thefamily-scale farming which exposed transnational corporations for puttingsynthetic preservatives into supposedly organic baby formula. The disinformationhas reached such ludicrous levels with regard to fluoride that a website calledHealth Day (‘news for healthier living’) ran an article by an Alan Mozes warningpeople that their children could be at risk from bottled water – because it doesnot contain fluoride. Mozes said that while most bottled water manufacturersdeclared that their products were 100 percent ‘pure’, ‘clean’ or ‘natural’, fewbrands contained one ingredient that most Americans take for granted: fluoride.He then goes on to say that fluoride added to drinking water is ‘a salt formedfrom the combination of fluorine and soil and rock minerals ...’ What utterbaloney. It is a waste product of the aluminium industry, much of it from China,and contains a list of other chemicals that cumulatively poison drinking water.Mozes quotes Dr Burton Edelstein, President of the Children’s Dental HealthProject in Washington DC, and a professor of dentistry and health policy andmanagement at Columbia University, as saying that tooth decay among children is‘alarming’. This is linked by implication to people drinking bottled waterwithout fluoride when the real reason is the explosion of sugarsoaked shit thatkids are given to eat and drink courtesy of ignorant parents and heartless,soulless corporations. The UK National Health Service (inversion) even says thatis good not to rinse away the fluoride residue:> A pea sized amount of toothpaste should be used for adults and children over> three and a smear of toothpaste should be used for babies and children under> three. The mouth should not be rinsed out after brushing. Spitting out> toothpaste and not rinsing, helps to leave a coating of fluoride on the> surface of the teeth which helps to prevent tooth decay.Yes, and a pea-sized amount of brain activity should be used wheneverrecommending this. I was in a ‘health’ store in Britain called Holland andBarrett (I am not proud of it, I was looking for fluoride-free toothpaste) andthere on the shelf was ‘natural’ toothpaste – with added fluoride. Read theingredient labels when you buy salt, too, because that is also increasinglybeing contaminated with fluoride. Fortunately, we are seeing more cases ofcommunities winning campaigns to stop the fluoridisation of their drinking waterand the Fluoride Action Network is a good starting point if you want to do thesame. A quick aside ... Holland and Barrett is owned by the Father GeorgeBush-connected Carlyle Group, the US private equity firm which had the bin Ladenfamily among its clients at the time of 9/11. The Carlyle Group also owns thechemists Boots and Alliance Pharmacies in the UK and General Nutrition Centers(GNC) in the United States. Covering all bases, then. Bloodline corporations andinvestors have been buying up health stores around the world to ensure that theyare soon no longer health stores except in name to prevent access to effectivesupplements and healthy food that would overcome the consequences of the crapthat we are otherwise offered as ‘nutrition’. Health stores are bought by thecorporations to end their contribution to health and the genuine ones thatremain are targeted by the authorities and their goonatics. It is the sameprinciple as the attacks on raw milk producers and organic growers in the UnitedStates – destroy the public’s access to healthy sources of food and sustenanceso they can only eat your poison. There is also pressure to allow mind-alteringlithium to be added to drinking water to make people docile and ‘stabilisemood’. Two of the frontline advocates are Dr Jacob Appel (Rothschild Zionist) atMount Sinai Hospital in New York (the same place that the ‘prophet’ Dr RichardDay came from) and Dr Gerhard Schauzer (Rothschild Zionist) at the University ofCalifornia. Dr Appel said that exposure to lithium would make the brain ‘morehappy’ – make people love their servitude, as Aldous Huxley put it. Mount SinaiHospital comes up a lot and one of its former employees is the current presidentof the American Psychiatric Association, the seriously Big Pharma-connectedJeffrey Lieberman (Rothschild Zionist) who has a stream of financial and‘advisory’ ties to the pharmaceutical cartel. One other point about fluoride:Even if you live in an area without fluoride in the water supply or have thebest of water filters you are still consuming it in your food through thefluoridated water used to irrigate the crops (including ‘organic’) and in thefood factories. Plants are mostly water. It is the same with drinking beer, wineand soft drinks produced with fluoridated water and another source of fluoridepoisoning are the fluoroquinolone antibiotics which interfere with DNAreplication.Poisons from the sky[../Images/00207.jpg]Figure 729: Poisoned from the sky.[../Images/00319.jpg]Figure 730: Chemtrails are just a conspiracy theory ... it’s not reallyhappening.Another constant form of mass poisoning is the chemical trails sprayed fromaircraft into the sky all over the world (Fig 729). People in North Americabegan to notice in the late 1990s how the sky was being crisscrossed by whitestreaks that appeared at first to be the contrails or condensation trailspouring from the back of aircraft; but it soon became clear that these were notcontrails. Instead of dispersing very quickly as contrails do they remained forhours expanding and filling the sky and they became known as chemtrails. I haveoften watched aircraft systematically flying to and fro across the same areauntil a once clear blue sky was like a patchwork of white lines which expandeduntil the whole sky became like a cloudy day (Fig 730). Reports began to come infrom across the world as this phenomenon increased and I have seen it in everycountry I have visited. There have even been some mainstream media reports andquestions in parliaments without any credible answer (Fig 731). The cloudsproduced by chemtrails eventually fall to the earth to pollute rivers, land,people, plants and forests with what analysis has shown are metals such asaluminium, barium, radioactive thorium and highly toxic pathogens includingMycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain). Dr Garth Nicholson from the Instituteof Molecular Medicine in California found this in 45 percent of former US troopssuffering from the debilitating disease called Gulf War Syndrome and chemtrailsprovide a mass-delivery system for engineered disease and other atmosphericthreats to health. Metals like aluminium and barium have been found to beaccumulating in water and soil worldwide with very high levels in the areas mosttargeted with chemtrails. Aluminium in snow on Mount Shasta in NorthernCalifornia was found to have soared from seven parts per billion to 61,000 partsper billion (Fig 732). The effect on plant growth and soil quality is also beingrecorded (Fig 733). People have complained of respiratory and flu-like illness,mental confusion and depression when their skies have been targeted. Barium inthe atmosphere weakens muscles, including those of the heart, and thorium isknown to cause leukaemia and other cancers. A few mainstream media organisationshave covered the connection between chemtrail spraying and the ill health thatimmediately follows in the same area, but as usual it is the alternative mediathat has taken up the story and made the public aware of what is happening.Aluminium has been connected to osteoporosis and Alzheimer’s disease, and bothaluminium and barium suppress the human immune system by deactivating T-cellreceptors and preventing them from resisting disease. The immune system is aprime target of the mass cull. I have long been convinced that chemtrailscontain a form of nanotechnology which is so microscopic that it’s well beyondthe realm of the human eye. Nanoparticles are now used in thousands of productsincluding food, clothing, medicine, shampoo, toothpaste and sunscreen. They havethe potential for human and environmental mutation and yet they are scarcelyregulated. Dr Russell Blaylock, an American neurosurgeon and expert inneurotoxins, has connected nanoparticles of aluminium in chemtrails to thecorresponding increase in degenerative diseases of the brain like Alzheimer’sand Parkinson’s. Blaylock points out that nanoparticles of aluminium can quicklyenter the brain after being breathed in as chemtrails fall to the ground.Aluminium containers for things like acidic sodas are another form of cumulativealuminium intake. Even small amounts of water-soluble barium can cause breathingdifficulties, increased blood pressure, heart rhythm changes, stomachirritation, muscle weakness, changes in nerve reflexes, swelling of brains andliver tissue, kidney and heart damage. But surely the government would notpoison its own population? Chemical and Biological Warfare Program, Public Law95-79 [P L 95-79], Title 50, Chapter 32[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos952139], Section 1520: ‘The use of humansubjects will be allowed for the testing of chemical and biological agents bythe U.S. Department of Defense, accounting to Congressional committees withrespect to the experiments and studies’. Public Law 95-79, Title VIII, Sec. 808,July 30, 1977, 91 Stat. 334: ‘The Secretary of Defense [may] conduct tests andexperiments involving the use of chemical and biological [warfare] agents oncivilian populations [within the United States]’. These are only two examples ofwhat is said on record but most of what is done is ‘off the books’. At the sametime that chemtrails appeared so did a terrible illness known as Morgellonsdisease. This produces coloured fibres which can be pulled through the skin onlyfor them to be replaced by others. I say this is nanotechnology in thechemtrails and it is also infiltrating the natural world. Symptoms of Morgellonsdisease include crawling, stinging and biting sensations of the skin; skinlesions that will not heal; extreme fatigue; severe mental confusion; short-termmemory loss; joint pain; a sharp decline in vision; itching so bad that somevictims consider suicide; and serious neurological disorders (Fig 734). GMO hasalso been identified as a possible cause of Morgellons with DNA of both fungusand bacterium used extensively in GMOs found in the fibres of Morgellonsdisease. Dr Rima Laibow, medical director for the Natural Solutions Foundation,said:[../Images/00353.jpg]Figure 731: Now you see them; now you don’t.[../Images/00186.jpg]Figure 732: The scale of chemtrail activity worldwide is fantastic.[../Images/00244.jpg]Figure 733: Chemtrail technology?[../Images/00109.jpg]Figure 734: Chemtrails (with their nano-technology I’m sure) and Morgellonsdisease came together.> ... GM technology apparently has, like Professor Frankenstein found, a way to> animate the non-living. These fibers twist and twine, grow and divide. In> short, living beneath the skin of people, they form parasitic lesions out of> what should be nonliving material but which, through the horror of genetic> modification, has taken on the characteristics of a living thing ...This is another form of Archontic possession. Sunlight is vital to human healthand also carries information, but the amount of sunlight measured at the Earth’ssurface has been falling since the 1950’s and even more so since 1990. This hasbecome known as ‘global dimming’ and it is absolutely connected togeoengineering. The worldwide average decrease in direct sunlight reaching theground was about five percent between 1960 and 1990 and up to 17 percent since1990 in the period that chemtrails began and have incessantly expanded. This hasmultiple implications for human health, awareness, food production and the‘natural’ world in general. The chemtrail programme will be fiercelycompartmentalised so that only the deep insiders know what is really happening.Pilots and others involved will be told a cover story that it is to block outthe sun to prevent global warming when they are really spraying poisons on theirown families and the food and water that they will have to consume (Fig 735).American scientists even went public in 2012 with a study based on transporting‘sun-dimming particles’ eleven miles above the Earth every year in a strategycalled ‘solar radiation management’. They estimated that using planes andairships to do this would cost $5 billion a year, but they said that this wouldbe cheaper than ... giant guns or rockets or a pipeline into the stratosphere.Wake me up, mother. If anyone thinks that governments and military would notintentionally poison the population, well they have been doing it for decadeafter decade as revelations and reports long after the events have proved timeand again. It has happened many times in the UK and other countries andcertainly it has happened ongoing in the United States. Tenacious investigationby sociologist Lisa Martino-Taylor revealed in 2012 how the US military hadsprayed zinc cadmium sulfide on the population in St Louis to study thesubsequent health effects in the 1950s and 60s. The focus of the spraying waspoor and low-income families in line with the ‘values’ of eugenics and Agenda21. The potential consequences of breathing in zinc cadmium sulfide includekidney disease and cancer, and an estimated 70 percent of those targeted werechildren under 12. Senate hearings in 1977 were told that biological agents werepurposely released in similar experiments in a list of cities between 1949 and1969 including San Francisco, Washington DC, Minneapolis and St Louis. Bacteriahave been released in subway systems in New York and Chicago to test theireffect and the US government had to issue a belated apology for purposelyinfecting people in Guatemala with a sexuality-transmitted disease. The list isendless and the ones we don’t know about will be at least thousands of timesgreater than those that we do. Governments and Big Pharma are controlled by thesame network that controls the military and so each serves the interests of theother. None of them could give a damn about human health and suffering becausethey have closed hearts and Archontic minds.[../Images/00180.jpg]Figure 735: ‘Don’t worry lads, the stuff you’re dumping is to stop globalwarming. Your kids will be fine.’[../Images/00209.jpg]Figure 736: The effect of fluoride on the pineal gland.Vibrational ‘poison’We see chemicals and poisons in the holographic realm as substances, but intheir base state they are deeply distorted waveform information fields that havethe potential to deeply distort the human energy field through their interactionin the act of eating and drinking and, in the case of poisoned air, breathing.Is that Diet Coke guy still breathing, by the way? Oh, he’s working on it. Good.He says he’ll start when he’s finished his chemically-flavoured fake strawberrymoose? Right, not so good. Distortions in the human energy field caused bydistortions in the chemical fields play through to the holographic realm in theform of mental and emotional imbalance and distress and countless ‘physical’effects. The Archons and their bloodline hybrids also need to entrap people inthe low-vibrational frequency band of the Saturn-Moon Matrix and stop themgetting ‘out there’ into Consciousness where they could see what the game isfrom an expanded state of perception. How significant, therefore, that fluoridecalcifies the pineal gland, a part of the so-called ‘Third Eye’ which allows usto perceive beyond the five senses. Dr Jennifer Luke at Britain’s University ofSurrey found the adult pineal gland accumulates more fluoride than any othersoft tissue and can be enveloped with deposits of calcite micro crystals withthe hardness of teeth. Fluoride is magnetically attracted to the pineal glandand forms calcium phosphate crystals (Fig 736). This can reach advanced stageswhich destabilise the sense of direction and makes people disorientated,forgetful and even zombie-like. Mess up the pineal gland and the crazies hit thejackpot. It’s no surprise then that the pineal gland is under attack from alldirections from fluoride in drinking water and toothpaste to a whole gamut ofelectromagnetic forces. The pineal is a major gland of the endocrine system andworks with the pituitary gland, also in the brain, to form the ‘Third Eye’. TheControl System wants none of that because the very foundation of itsmanipulation of perception and so behaviour is to isolate human awareness infive-sense reality. The pine cone-shaped pineal gland, often called ‘the seat ofthe soul’, can connect us with higher dimensions of infinite reality because itis a prime receiver-transmitter. The wider the frequency band that it canconnect with the wider our range of spiritual and intuitive awareness. TheControl System’s aim is to close this doorway to the infinite forever. Those inthe shadows driving the direction of human society had precisely this in mindwhen they manipulated this waste product from the aluminium industry intodrinking water and toothpaste through the outrageous lie that is was good forteeth. Another of the pineal gland’s contributions to expanded awareness is thatit secretes dimethyltryptamine or DMT which opens the mind to the greaterconsciousness. Psychoactive potions such as ayahuasca and magic mushroomscontain DMT and the consequences for human perception of a dysfunctional pinealgland are obvious. It slams the door on expanded perception. There are otherwidespread consequences for pineal gland dysfunction and these include a seriousthreat to health and even life itself. The pineal communicates with thepituitary and other glands of the endocrine system – the main ones are thehypothalamus, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenals and reproductive glands. The heart,too, has a crucially important glandular function. This system of glandsinfluences almost every cell, organ and body process and regulates mood, growth,tissue, metabolism, sexual function and reproduction through the secretion ofchemical messengers that we call hormones. The endocrine glands are designed towork in harmony with the nervous system. They also interact directly with thechakra vortex system that connects the holographic self with deeper levels ofenergetic being. Malfunctioning endocrine glands become malfunctioning chakrasand vice-versa and fundamentally impacts upon the constant target of the Archons– the immune system. The chakra connection also takes us ‘out there’ in terms ofinformation, sight and perception.What a coincidence then that the chemical bisphenol-A or BPA which seeps out ofcountless plastic containers of ‘natural water’ and foodstuffs belongs to abroad group of substances known as ‘endocrine disruptors’. BPA is a chemicalcompound found in polycarbonate plastics and resins that line food and drinkcontainers and can be found in plastic baby bottles, teething rings, baby toysand canned foods. BPA chemicals are known as EDC’s which is short for ... herewe go yet again: endocrine disrupting chemicals. The US Environmental Protection(inversion) Agency has always said that low levels of BPA are harmless to humanswhich means that they are not. Research published in Environmental HealthPerspectives suggested that even at lower than official ‘safe’ levels there canbe long lasting health effects and another study conducted at Duke Universityand published in the journal Proceedings of The National Academy Sciencesdiscovered that BPA could damage the development of the central nervous system.Dr Wolfgang Liedtke, an associate professor of medicine and neurology at DukeUniversity, said: ‘Our study found that BPA may impair the development of thecentral nervous system, and raises the question as to whether exposure couldpredispose animals and humans to neurodevelopmental disorders.’ Virtually allfood is now wrapped in plastic and its contents like BPA are released into food.Supermarkets like Britain’s Tesco label food ‘organic’ but wrap it in plasticwhich means that it can’t be organic because the plastic seeps into the food andliquid. One research study by the US Centers for Disease Control found that 90percent of those tested had BPA in their urine and when I last went to that pageon the CDC website it was no longer available. BPA and its family of endocrinedisruptors (including disruption of the pineal gland) seriously distort hormonalbalance and open people to wide range of physical and emotional consequences.They have also been shown to trigger early puberty in mice, sex changes in fishand have been linked to breast cancer in women, brain damage in children, andsexual dysfunction in men. BPA mimics the female hormone oestrogen and one studyfound that more than 300 of the 450 plastic containers tested were leachinghormone-like compounds. Even the World Health Organization has warned thatchemicals in a long list of common household items threaten human health throughcancer, asthma, reduced fertility and even birth defects. Researchers at DukeUniversity in North Carolina have discovered that babies exposed to BPA beforebirth could suffer suppressed central nervous system development that could leadto underdevelopment of the brain. British scientists are warning that popularhair dyes used by millions of women contain a number of chemicals linked tocancer and they say that home hair colouring kits and dyes used at moreexpensive hair salons have the potential to combine with airborne pollutants,including tobacco smoke, ‘to form one of the most powerful cancer-causingcompounds known to man’. Researchers from the School of Public Health at theUniversity of California, Berkeley, tested 32 popular lipstick and lip glossproducts and found many of them to be ‘loaded with cadmium, chromium, aluminiumand at least five other metals’.

Another theme that can be seen again and again is the distortion of thehuman receiver-transmitter and decoding processes. The pineal gland has beenshown to be fundamentally affected by solar activity in the form ofelectromagnetic fields which also affect us mentally, emotionally and‘physically’. This confirms that the pineal gland can be suppressed by thetechnologically-generated electromagnetic soup that urban dwellers, andincreasingly people much further afield, have to live in today. It is to thisthat we shall now turn."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00092.jpg]‘Smart’ EverythingMost people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions, theirlives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.Oscar WildeWireless systems communicating between chips embedded in people and technologysuch as domestic appliances is the very foundation of Agenda 21. The plan is forhumans that survive the cull to become nothing more than terminals on a globalwireless Internet.Countless wireless networks are now in operation with many more to come if wecontinue to allow this to happen. These are not individual networks as they areportrayed. They are different facets in the same seamless whole – a globalwireless control system (Fig 737). This is why the Archontic FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) has proposed a free wireless Internet systemthat would be available to everyone anywhere in the United States. The FCC saidthat this ‘super-Wi-Fi’ would exploit a portion of the wireless spectrumcurrently used by television broadcasts and be significantly more powerful [moreradioactive] than the current Wi-Fi spectrum. This would make it possible forthe signal to travel greater distances and pass through buildings and otherobstacles. Google and Microsoft have supported the idea so it must be bad forpeople. They said that free national Internet access would make possible anation of smart networked devices – ‘millions of devices that will compose thecoming Internet of things’ which just happens to be the Archon agenda that Ihave been exposing all these years. I’ll come to the ‘Internet of things’shortly. Governments are not spending large sums to expand the reach of thewireless Internet to help people. This is not their job. They are doing itbecause the wireless Internet is a major part of the planned wireless global webof interconnected information and surveillance sources that includes wirelesscommunications and surveillance in the street through a technology calledIntellistreets, of which more later. This web is designed to broadcast withinthe frequency band of human brain and electromagnetic activity to plant thoughtsand perceptions and read intentions. At the core of this is the Smart Grid whichis already impacting on many lives through the imposition of Smart Meters andinvolves major bloodline companies such as IBM, GE, Siemens and Accenture, theworld’s biggest management and consulting firm. Watch for the term ‘smart’because this is code for different aspects and expressions of the planned-to-beunified Smart Grid ... so we have Smart Phones, Smart Cities, Smart Televisions,Smart Pills and the economic version ‘Smart Growth’. The European Commission hasproposed new technologies at border crossings and the plan is called ‘SmartBorders’. This is more perception manipulation with ‘smart’ (Intelligence;acumen) being mindassociated with seeing the construction of a global electronicprison as the sensible thing to do. Once again Smart Meters are being justifiedby ‘climate change’ and energy saving when the real reason is mass control. Theclimate change lie is the foundation on which Agenda 21 stands or falls and itis clear why no level of evidence and direct experience which demolishes theofficial story is ever enough for a re-think and change of direction. Let us getthe Orwellian language out of the way first before we cut to the chase. SmartMeters are described as ‘an intelligent digitised energy-network deliveringelectricity in an optimum way from source to consumption’. Okay, many thanks,you can go now, much appreciated. Right, so what are they, really? Smart Metersare part of an emerging Smart Grid of wireless communication from centralisedcontrol centres to and from every home and business. It is planned that everyoneon the planet will eventually be connected to the Smart Grid wireless field (Fig738). How will they do this for all the people living in rural areas, isolatedhomes, and the billions scattered across rural lands all over the world? Theywouldn’t be there anymore. Those that were not culled would be packed togetherin the densely populated megacities where everyone will be subject to thewireless mind control and surveillance of the Smart Grid. Origin Energy,Australia’s biggest power supplier, has a privacy/consent form on its websitelisting the organisations with which a Smart Meter customer must agree to sharetheir private data:[../Images/00265.jpg]Figure 737: The ‘Smart’ world of 24/7 mind control.[../Images/00010.jpg]Figure 738: Smart Meters are an essential part of the web of wireless perceptioncontrol.> • Government authorities> • Electricity installers> • Mail houses> • Data processing analysts> • IT service providers> • Smart energy technology providers> • Debt collection agencies> • Credit reporting agenciesOrigen Energy said that ‘the additional information requested about eachhousehold adds to the richness of the Origin Smart experience’. This ‘richness’also includes the authorities and bloodline energy companies having the power toturn down your heating whenever they choose once the Smart Meter system isinstalled and even turn off your fridge eventually. The real reason for SmartMeters is hidden behind bullshit such as ‘increased use of digital informationand controls technology to improve reliability, security and efficiency of theelectric grid’ and ‘integration of “smart” appliances and consumer devices’. Thelatter means that all domestic appliances are planned to be microchipped toreceive and communicate information to and from the centralised control centres.All this will allow Big Brother to know every time you open your fridge door,wash, go to bed or use your computer and how many people are in your home andwhere they are. Now you can see the significance of the Apple-connected chipcompany ARM producing ‘low-powered, less expensive chips for use in domesticappliances, even doorbells’ and why former CIA Director David Petraeus said:> ... items of interest will be located, identified, monitored and remotely> controlled through technologies such as radio-frequency identification> [microchips], sensor networks, tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters –> all connected to the next-generation Internet using abundant, low-cost, and> high-power computing that would ‘transform’ the art of spying and allow people> to be monitored automatically without planting bugs or direct infiltration.Petraeus referred to new technologies which add processors and web connectionsto home appliances like fridges, ovens and lighting systems, the plan known asthe ‘Internet of Things’. This is the system that Google and Microsoft saidcould be made possible by free and more powerful Wi-Fi throughout the UnitedStates. An enormous amount of information can be gleaned from detailed access toenergy consumption. Research has already established that the energy consumptionpatterns of a flat screen television can be used to establish what programme youare watching and Petraeus confirmed that people could be watched through their‘Smart’ televisions – Orwell’s ‘Telescreens’ – and they don’t seem to care thatwe know anymore. Google has a project called appropriately Google X to developthe technology for the Brave New World. The Irish Times reported:> Google X is a clandestine lab where ideas involving robots and lifts to outer> space are being explored and developed.

Smart Meters are, bydefinition, surveillance devices which violate Federal and State wiretappinglaws by recording and storing databases of private personal activities andbehaviours without the consent or knowledge of those people who are monitored.It is possible with analysis of certain Smart Meter data for unauthorised anddistant parties to determine medical conditions, sexual activities, the locationof people within the home, vacancy patterns and the personal information andhabits of the occupants. People are already being raided when energy use hasincreased significantly and criminal activity is suspected. Once police havegained access to homes this way and found their suspicions to be unfounded theyhave charged people with other unconnected offences during the search of theproperty. The Foundation for Information Policy Research in the UK ischallenging Smart Meters on the basis that they are so easy to hack. RossAnderson, the Foundation’s chairman and a computer science professor, said thatthe government’s own listening station GCHQ had told him they were concernedabout the potential for external manipulation of the Smart Meter system. Onecommentator said that we won’t have to worry about getting bombed if we go towar because the enemy only has to hack us and turn off the power. A ‘Whitehallsource’ quoted by the London Daily Mail said: ‘This is a bonkers policy that hasto be stopped before it gets out of hand ... it is being sold as aconsumerfriendly device to help you save power but in the wrong hands, it willbe a total disaster.’ It is already in the wrong hands – the Archontic Cabalbehind it all. Nick Pickles from Big Brother Watch said:> We are witnessing a massive intrusion into what goes on in millions of homes.> This comes when there is increasing surveillance of our society. Smart meters> are a step towards our homes becoming the next line of attack for state> snoopers.Anna Fielder from Privacy International said: ‘This could mean risks of identitytheft, real time surveillance, unwanted publicity, profiling or targeting forcommercial purposes and also potential discriminatory practices by powercompanies targeting tariffs to maximise profits.’ The European Data ProtectionSupervisor Peter Hustinx has warned that Smart Meters are a threat to privacyand wants this to be addressed before it is too late. The UK Department ofEnergy, a ‘government’ department owned by the power companies, replied to thiscommon sense by saying that meters will ‘help put people in control of theirenergy use and eliminate the cause of a huge number of complaints – inaccuratebills’. Another liar or out-of-the-loop idiot, take your pick. As if all this ishappening worldwide to eliminate inaccurate bills and as for giving peoplecontrol over their energy use, the very opposite is true. Claims that SmartMeters will reduce energy bills have also proved bogus. The experience for manyis that bills soar and we are paying for the installation through taxation andgovernment borrowing – paying to build our own prison as usual and there arealso plans to introduce Smart Water Meters when the whole thing will berepeated. A number of Smart Meters have caught fire and set homes ablaze. Sowhat is it all about? Agenda 21. There are also the health consequences ofliving in the electromagnetic fields generated by the meters in the ExtremelyLow Frequency or ELF range. The American Academy of Environmental Medicine said:> The Board of AAEM ... opposes the installation of smart meters in homes and> schools based on scientific assessment of the current medical literature> [which] raises credible questions about genetic and cellular effects, hormonal> effects, male fertility, blood/brain barrier damage and increased risk of> certain types of cancers from RF or ELF levels similar to those emitted from> smart meters. The Board ... finds it unacceptable from a public health> standpoint to implement this technology until these serious medical concerns> are resolved. We consider a moratorium on installation of wireless smart> meters to be an issue of the highest importance.[../Images/00106.jpg]Figure 739: Wireless radiation has countless effects on mind, emotions andhealth.People have complained after Smart Meters have been installed of severemigraines, fatigue, weakness, inability to make decisions, hair loss, musclepain and pain around the heart, breathlessness, sexual problems and a decreasein lactation in nursing mothers (Fig 739). Olle Johansson from the Department ofNeuroscience at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, wrote this to theCalifornia Public Utilities Commission:> Many smart meters are close to beds, kitchens, playrooms and similar> locations. These wireless systems are never off, and the exposure is not> voluntary ...

We have to go beyondcomplaining and develop networks, peaceful techniques and numbers that cannot beignored. If we don’t stop this, the consequences are unthinkable andunspeakable. Smart Grid wireless information fields transmitting informationfrom homes and businesses is horrific enough, but information can come the otherway within the frequency range of human brain activity and implant perceptionsof life, the world and reality. Leave your home to get away from this? Thiswould mean walking in the streets where the Intellistreets technology will bebroadcasting the same information and it would be happening at every workplaceand centre for ‘education’ (programming). Get out of the city? There will be nogetting out of a city under Agenda 21. Get on a train and go to another city?The wireless perception control will continue on the train, too, and that’s evenif you get have permission to travel (Fig 740).[../Images/00204.jpg]Figure 740: Big Brother goes wireless.Red flags and big flashing lightsYou know when something is vital to Agenda 21 when it is forced upon thepopulation in every country no matter how vehemently people complain. Thoserefusing the meters are being told that their electricity will be cut off andthis intimidation needs to be resisted en masse. Smart Meters and Smart Gridsare such a key pillar in the entire Agenda 21 structure that advocates talkabout the need for ‘identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessarybarriers to adoption of Smart Grid technologies, practices and services’.Residents all over the world have discovered what that means as widespreadopposition to the system has been ignored by those in power. Hired thugsemployed by the corporate thugs continue to ignore people who refuse the metersand climb over fences and cut locks on gates to gain access. Mona Orkoulas, areal estate worker living near Las Vegas, Nevada, came home to find that NVEnergy had installed a Smart Meter on the outside of her bedroom wall withoutpermission or prior notice. She quickly began to experience a faster heart rateand higher blood pressure when she woke in the mornings along with headaches andfatigue. There was also a low grinding noise coming from the meter making itdifficult for her to sleep. She was to find that she was far from alone in thesymptoms she was having among people with Smart Meters in the homes andbusinesses. Her doctor wrote this letter to NV Energy:> Neurological and cardiological findings may be associated with pulsed EMF...> EEG, ECG, MRI and sleep study changes may be associated in some hypersensitive> individuals to pulsed EMF. If multiple Smart meters are in use in her area,> the possibility of constructive and destructive interference between the> various EMF signals is a distinct possibility whose effects may be potentially> more dangerous. I recommend that this patient be allowed to have NVE reinstall> an analogue meter at her house.The company refused to do so and after months and six attempts to have themremove the meter she employed an electrician to install an analogue meter.Recordings of electricity usage on both meters were photographed to ensure thatshe paid all that was required. Nevada is supposed to have an opt-out policy forSmart Meters, but that is not the way it works. Three armed men arrived atMona’s property and removed both the meters to leave her with no electricity.She asked them why they had come with guns and one said ‘this is procedureMa’am’. Procedure is a good word to describe the workings of what pass for‘mind’ with these software programs. A procedure is something that is constantlyrepeated and in the heads of these people is a computer disk spinning aroundjust repeating the same behaviour, attitudes and responses. The same disk, ordata stick, is installed in politicians, scientists, doctors, media people (Iwon’t say ‘journalists’), corporation executives, police and military, adinfinitum. It turned out that Nevada does not have a Smart Meter opt-out, butonly a ‘delay list’. If they can sneak onto your property while you are out andinstall a meter then your choice is accepting this or having no electricity.This is what humanity has descended to – sneaking onto property to installtechnology that will seriously affect the health of people and their childrenand delete their privacy. The world is insane, but so insane it thinks it isintelligent. Mothers in the Chicago suburban city of Naperville were arrested bylocal police in front of their families when they tried to stop two goons frominstalling these Orwellian and health-dismantling meters (Fig 741). When we seeenforcement like this of something that people in very large numbers don’t wantyou can be sure that it is Agenda 21 and the Archons are not taking no for ananswer unless we make them by coming together in mass refusal.[../Images/00228.jpg]Figure 741: Naperville families protest at enforced Smart Meters.Light bulb insanityThe gathering imposition of ‘green’ fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) around theworld is all connected to this system of delivering perception programming tothe masses through the Smart Grid (Fig 742). Here again we have something thatis ridiculous both in light efficiently and health consequences which is notonly being encouraged but imposed by law (Figs 743 and 744). Green? The UKHealth Protection Agency list of must-do’s when one of these bulbs breaksincludes everything short of abandoning the building. The bulbs contain lethalmercury, or quicksilver as it is also called. A report in The Ellsworth Americandescribed what happened when a bulb broke in the home of Brandy Bridges fromProspect, Maine. A specialist from the Maine Department of EnvironmentalProtection recorded mercury levels in her daughter’s bedroom that were six timesthe State’s ‘safe’ limit for mercury contamination (and official ‘safe’ limitsare never safe in the first place). Brandy Bridges ended up paying a privateclean-up firm $2,000 to decontaminate the room as a result of one ‘green’ lightbulb releasing its contents. The German Federal Environment Agency found thatthey release toxic vapour when they break that is up to 20 times higher than thealleged safe limit for an indoor area. These are the same bulbs that the UKGovernment’s Environment Department says are safe (Fig 745). ‘Energy efficientlight bulbs are not a danger to the public’, some told-what-to-say goferannounced. Well, actually they are, as is the UK Environment Department come tothat. Its website gives this helpful advice: ‘Although they contain mercury,limited at 5 mg per lamp, it cannot escape from a lamp that is intact.’ So bulbsdon’t break, then? Oh, but if they do ‘the very small amount contained in anenergy efficient bulb is unlikely to cause harm’. Try telling that to BrandyBridges, the UK Health Protection Agency and the millions who have sufferedhealth problems of various kinds because of them. Only an idiot, or one with avery malevolent intent, would legislate to force people and businesses to putmega-billions of these health destroyers in virtually every room worldwide, butthat is what is happening in country after country. Mercury is so toxic (more sothan arsenic and lead) that it has been banned from many devices such asthermometers and vehicle and thermostat switches. Children and the unborn areespecially at risk from mercury (you know, the stuff they use in tooth fillingsand vaccines). Serious health effects of mercury contamination includeAlzheimer’s disease, depression, loss of memory, inability to control musclesand movements (known as ‘motor function’) and kidney failure. A study by Germanyscientists led by Peter Braun at the Berlin’s Alab Laboratory revealed that the‘green’ bulbs emit cancer-causing agents (great for culling the population).Braun said: ‘For such carcinogenic substances it is important they are kept asfar away as possible from the human environment.’ But they are being forced uponpeople to be used throughout the human environment. The report by the Germanscientists said that the bulbs should not be left on for extended periods,especially near the head, because they emit chemicals including phenol,naphthalene and styrene. Andreas Kirchner of the Federation of German Engineerssaid that electrical smog develops around these lamps and Abraham Haim, aprofessor of biology at Haifa University in Israel, said that the bluer lightfrom CFLs closely mimicked daylight and disrupted the production of the hormonemelatonin. I will explain the consequences of that later, but Haim said thatthis could result in more breast cancer if the bulbs are used late at night.Skin specialists have warned that CFLs can make skin conditions worsen and theMigraine Action Association has linked them to headaches. These lights arebeloved of the Green movement despite their horrendous health and environmentconsequences because most Greens are so deeply uniformed and self-righteous thatthey cannot see how they are being manipulated. I stayed at a ‘green’ hotel inCopenhagen, Denmark, once where everything was straight from theprotect-the-environment textbook and so every light was a CFL. Had I not knownthe consequences and wanted to read in bed a light would have been inches frommy head which scientists who have studied the subject strongly warn against. TheGreen movement has so lost the plot it’s ridiculous.[../Images/00255.jpg]Figure 742: Fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs) – useless light and terribleconsequences.[../Images/00012.jpg]Figure 743: Madness, sheer bloody madness.[../Images/00406.jpg]Figure 744: Safe bulbs are being banned by law because the fluorescent varietyare designed to be part of the Smart Meter control grid.[../Images/00423.jpg]Figure 745: ‘It didn’t use to be like this – dustpan and brush and it was jobdone. Still, you can’t stop progress.’The bulbs are officially labelled hazardous household waste when it comes totheir disposal, but billions of them are going to end up in land-fill tips wheretheir mercury will be released and enter the water supply. This must be alreadyhappening on a significant scale. Given that an estimated 5.5 million lightbulbs are bought in the United States every day with some four billion in use atany one time just think of the implications of the US government ban onincandescent bulbs which have served us perfectly well for so long and only the‘green’ variety remain. One compact fluorescent bulb can pollute 6,000 gallonsof water beyond ‘safe’ mercury levels and so ensuring mercury-contaminated fishand other wildlife as well as people. Where is the Environmental ProtectionAgency when you need them? Oh, at Monsanto with their tongues in theready-position? Thanks. The European Union has been phasing out incandescentlight bulbs since 2009 by banning their production and distribution and anever-growing list of other countries are doing the same, including the UnitedStates, Canada, Australia and Russia. More than 80 million fluorescent tubes areestimated to end up in UK landfill sites alone every year which means some fourtonnes of mercury. This is in only one country of 60 million people in a worldof more than seven billion. Mercury from tooth fillings, light bulbs and othersources are part of the programme to poison the population with a view to themass cull and to stop the sharp and efficient functioning of brain and body. Thebrain suppressant fluoride is added to public drinking water for the samereason. Interestingly, fluoride and fluorescent, as in ‘green’ light bulbs, havea common ‘ancestor’ in the highly-damaging element called Fluorine (alsoFluorspar). This is derived from the mineral fluorite (from the Latin root fluo,meaning ‘to flow’). Both of its offspring, fluoride and fluorescent light bulbs,distort brain function. The ‘green’ bulbs operate like the rest of the SmartGrid on multiple levels. Scientific tests and studies have confirmed that theygive off toxic chemicals but they also transmit electromagnetic distortion whichdelivers mercury and other toxins in the form of frequency. This is what ismissed with damaging technology and toxins – they are distorted frequencies. Apoison like mercury that we see holographically is only a decoded version of adeeply distorted information field and this information is being broadcast bythe light bulbs all the time they are switched on. This distorted information isdelivered in the form of radiation and the waveform and electromagnetic levelsof toxins, and in the case of mercury photons are being released in theultraviolet (UV) range. People are reporting illnesses and a bright red rashappearing on their face when they use them. A study by researchers from StonyBrook University in New York discovered that exposure to these CFL light bulbshad the same effect on skill cells as ultraviolet radiation and you can see why.Professor Miriam Rafailovich from Stony Brook said:> Our study revealed that the response of healthy skin cells to UV emitted from> CFL bulbs is consistent with damage from ultraviolet radiation ... Skin cell> damage was further enhanced when low dosages of TiO2 nanoparticles were> introduced to the skin cells prior to exposure.> Despite their large energy savings, consumers should be careful when using> compact fluorescent light bulbs ... Our research shows that it is best to> avoid using them at close distances and that they are safest when placed> behind an additional glass cover.The UV radiation is fading paintings such as watercolours and also textileswhich are having to be protected by acrylic sheets. The flicker of fluorescentlights can affect people consciously and subconsciously and also photography andvideo recording. The vibrational/electrical impact is confirmed by many reportsof televisions switching channels when infra-red sensors are activated onremote-control receivers. Other reported health effects of ‘green’ lightinginclude: Mild to severe headaches (migraines); skin irritation, redness, burningsensations and/or itchiness; tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and earaches;numbness and tingling sensations; neurological impairment; neurodegenerativediseases; sterility; autism; tiredness, weakness and fatigue; difficultysleeping/restlessness; chest pains/heart problems; poor memory andconcentration; irritability; feelings of stress and anxiety; depression and moodswings; vision problems; difficulty breathing; extreme dizziness, nausea,flu-like symptoms, insomnia, muscle and joint pain; and pain and pressure in theeyes. Smart Meters transmit wireless information in electromagnetic pulses tothe electricity supplier and this is what triggers ill health (Fig 746).Electromagnetic/radioactive distortion of the human energy field is why there isa far greater prevalence of cancers among people living near or under powerlines and close to nuclear power stations. Dermatologist Dr John Hawk told theBBC that fluorescent lights seem to have some sort of ionising characteristicwhich affects the air around them. He said that probably tens of thousands ofpeople in Britain have ailments that flare up just by being close to them andshould use incandescent lighting. But they can’t, can they, when the alternativeis banned? Fluorescent bulbs have nothing going for them whatsoever from thepublic’s point of view. Their light is seriously inferior to incandescent bulbsand even the claim that they save energy is very questionable to say the least.If you switch them on and off too often they can quickly wear out, sometimesfaster than those they are replacing. ‘Green’ light bulbs and Smart Meters arebad in every way for the public, but that means they are good in every way forthose at war with the public. They contain and emit toxins, poison the watersupply and so people, fish and animals and generate a distorted energeticenvironment in every room which can be passed on to the human electromagneticfield and on again to the body itself. But there is another bonus, too – themost important one from the bloodline point of view.[../Images/00266.jpg]Figure 746: Hellooooooooooooo ....The light in your headElectricity and electromagnetic fields carry information and the SmartMeters/Smart Grids are designed to broadcast perception-manipulating thoughtsand beliefs through the wireless radiation fields. The ‘green’ light bulbs arean essential part of this system because they are information transmitters. Thisis why the authorities are seeking to ban the alternatives despite the 100percent downside of fluorescent bulbs and why Smart Meters are being forced onpeople, sometimes at gunpoint. Half a century ago Dr Robert Beck, an expert innuclear engineering, co-authored a scientific research paper with Dr Michael APersinger of Laurentian University in Canada, an expert in Extremely LowFrequency (ELF) radiation. The paper explored the potential for mind controlthrough the medium of electromagnetic fields. The connection is actually obviousbecause the human Body-Mind consists of electromagnetic or ‘auric’ fields and ifyou can hack into those fields you can feed them information that filtersthrough to the conscious mind to become what the person believes are their ownthoughts, perceptions and decisions. Dr Beck told a Psychotronics Associationconference in 1979 that people exposed to certain ELF field patterns hadexperienced sensations of uneasiness, depression and foreboding. He said that hehad studied the signal broadcast into the United States by the Soviet Union inthe 1970s which became known as the Woodpecker signal because it sounded likerepetitive tapping. The lack of ‘sides’ in the global Archontic network wasconfirmed yet again when despite the fake ‘Cold War’ the Americans sold Moscow a40-tonne ‘supermagnet’ in 1977 knowing full well what it would be used for andeven sent US scientists to install it. This allowed the Soviets to broadcast theperceptionmanipulating Woodpecker signal into the United States as part of longterm experiments to develop the Smart Grid. Lieutenant Colonel John B Alexanderwrote an article about Woodpecker in Military Review, the official publicationof the US Army Command and General Staff College. He said:> [Soviet Union] mind-altering techniques, designed to impact on an opponent are> welladvanced. The procedures employed include manipulation of human behaviour> through the use of psychological weapons effecting sight, sound, smell,> temperature, electromagnetic energy, or sensory deprivation ...> ... Soviet researchers, studying controlled behaviour, have also examined the> effects of electromagnetic radiation on humans and have applied these> techniques against the US Embassy in Moscow ...> ... Researchers suggest that certain low-frequency (ELF) emissions possesses> psychoactive characteristics. These transmissions can be used to induce> depression or irritability in a target population. The application of> large-scale ELF behaviour modification could have horrendous impact.ELF frequencies can create a global reality bubble because incoming ELFfrequencies are absorbed by the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere and this bothstops them getting through to us from space, or from Earth and out into space –so having the potential to create a reality bubble between the Earth andionosphere. This is what is happening. The NASA website explains:> As radio waves enter Earth’s atmosphere from space some of the waves are> absorbed by the electrons in the ionosphere while others pass through and are> detectable to ground-based observers. The frequency of each of these waves is> what determines whether or not it is absorbed or able to pass through the> atmosphere.> Low frequency radio waves do not travel very far through the atmosphere and> are absorbed rather quickly. Higher frequency waves are able to pass through> the atmosphere entirely and reach the ground. This process also works in> reverse for radio waves produced on the earth. The high frequency waves pass> through the ionosphere and escape into space while the low frequency waves> reflect off the ionosphere and essentially ‘skip’ around the earth.All these sources of radiation that I am describing, and others that I will cometo shortly, are adding to the reality and frequency bubble between the Earth andthe ionosphere which is creating a sort of sub-reality; a bubble within abubble. This is designed to be filled with frequencies and information withinthe range of human thought activity to impose mass perception control directlyand through a maze of inter-connected technologies including microchips. Metalsin chemtrails are involved in this, too, and they are geoengineering theatmosphere to become a highly-charged, electrically-conductive plasma toincrease the effectiveness of radio waves and other delivery systems to thehuman mind and emotions. All of which brings us back to Dr Robert Beck. He toldthe conference in 1979 that he had established how the Woodpecker signal wasbeing broadcast into American homes. Beck said that it was acting ‘likegangbusters ... right in the window of human psychoactivity’. The signal was‘permeating power grids in the United States, it was being picked up by powerlines, re-radiated’ and was then ’was coming into homes on the light circuits...’ Beck was speaking (a) nearly 35 years ago, so imagine how the technologyhas advanced since then; and (b) he was referring to an electrical system thatwas not specifically built for this purpose. The Smart Grid is designedprecisely for this purpose – to be a conduit for electrical and electromagneticinformation within the frequency band of human perception activity (Fig 747).This includes the ‘green’ light bulbs which are really information transmitters.Money is no object to their installation worldwide because it never is when theagenda demands something. Obama’s designed-to-fail ‘stimulus package’ in 2009gave billions for Smart Meters and the aim was for 50 million to have beeninstalled by 2012. The European Union wants 80 percent of homes connected tothis mind-control and surveillance system by 2020 and the EU requires this to bemandatory. The programme was instigated in Britain by then Energy Secretary EdMiliband (Rothschild Zionist), now leader of the opposition Labour Party, andhas been expanded by the Conservatives of Prime Minister David Cameron(Rothschild Zionist) in Britain’s one-party state. Smart Meters have alreadybeen installed in around 400,000 UK homes so far. The Associated Press reportedin July 2011 about a year-long ‘experiment’ to suspend the national electricitygrid in the United States which has always operated on the same frequency acrossthe country to ensure that one side of the country can be fed to the other ifnecessary. The AP report revealed that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionplanned to make different parts of the grid run at different frequencies and soit would no longer be a grid at all. Demetrios Matsakis, head of the timeservice department at the US Naval Observatory, said: ‘A lot of people are goingto have things break and they’re not going to know why.’ The Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission said that this nonsense was to make the grid (what grid bythen?) operate more efficiently. It is another step on the dark, dark road to anelectromagnetically-based global mind control system. Opposition is growing toSmart Meters as the truth about their consequences for health, privacy andpocket begin to circulate ever more widely. America’s biggest utility PacificGas and Electric Company responded to this by spying on protest groups whichwere described as ‘slackers’ and ‘insurgents’. William Devereaux, seniordirector of the company’s Smart Meter program until 2010, appeared at public andgovernment events to assure everyone that Smart Meters were safe and would notspy on people (he lied in other words); but privately he was posing as ‘RalphFlorea’, an ‘anti- Smart Meter protester’, to infiltrate and spy on genuineprotest groups. This was revealed in an investigation by the California PublicUtilities Commission. Pacific Gas and Electric Company filed a request to stopthe Commission from revealing the names of other executives involved. These arethe people who are telling you that Smart Meters are safe, won’t delete yourprivacy and won’t start a blaze in your pocket or your home. They are liars.Does anyone think for a moment that corporations seek to employ people who tellthe truth when that truth is bad for the agenda of the corporation and the forcethat ultimately controls them? I was sent a copy of a United States Patent fromApril, 1976 for the ‘apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and alteringbrain waves’. It described how brain activity could be manipulated and monitoredfrom a distance using electromagnetic fields. The following was included in thesummary:[../Images/00068.jpg]Figure 747: If you broadcast frequencies within the operational band of thebrain you can access and influence thought processes.> ... high frequency transmitters are operated to radiate electromagnetic energy> of different frequencies through antennas which are capable of scanning the> entire brain of the test subject or any desired region thereof. The signals of> different frequencies penetrate the skull of the subject and impinge upon the> brain where they mix to yield an interference wave modulated by radiations> from the brain’s natural electrical activity.[Modulate means ‘to vary the amplitude, frequency, or some other characteristicof a signal or power source’. In this case they tune their signals to thetarget’s brain frequency patterns.]> The modulated interference wave is re-transmitted by the brain and received by> an antenna at a remote station where it is demodulated, and processed to> provide a profile of the subject’s brain waves.> In addition to passively monitoring his brain waves, the subject’s> neurological processes may be affected by transmitting to his brain, through a> transmitter, compensating signals. The latter signals can be derived from the> received and processed brain waves.It goes on to emphasise the ability to manipulate brain wave activity(perception) by transmitting electromagnetic signals. This is what the ‘Smart’agenda is all about and there is so much more to this. Remember the above patentwas from 1976 – what must be possible today?The global web of mind controlSmart Meters and associated technology are not planned to operate in isolation.They are part of an electromagnetic radiation web to create a global ‘bubble’encircling the Earth’s atmosphere – especially the lower levels in which humanslive. You cannot appreciate the full significance of Smart Meters until youconnect them with other sources of radiation and mind control including thewireless Internet, cell phones, Intellistreets, telecommunications antennae andtechnology such as cell phone receiver-transmitters, and other sources such asthose known as GWEN, TETRA and HAARP (Fig 748). These are all planned to work asone unit in a global grid of mass mind and perception control from which therewould be no ‘physical’ escape. GWEN in the United States and TETRA in the UnitedKingdom (and wider afield) are wireless communication systems and I will come toHAARP in the next chapter. The communication towers of the Ground Wave EmergencyNetwork (GWEN) have been expanding across the United States spaced 200 milesapart since the early 1980s and overseen by the US Air Force. We are told thatthey are a back-up system for times of emergency should there be a nuclear waror other disaster that affects other forms of communication. This ‘explanation’is laughable. GWEN transmissions are specifically designed to hug and penetratethe ground where humans are and not to radiate into the higher atmosphere. GWENand these electromagnetic mind-control systems are planned to communicate withhuman microchips as well as the overall human mind. People subjected toelectromagnetic fields are much easier to mind control, a fact well established,and this is another tick for the system. Robert Becker, twice nominated for aNobel Prize for his expertise on the biological effects of electromagnetism,said that GWEN is a superb system, in combination with cyclotron resonance, forproducing behavioural alterations in the civilian population. Cyclotronresonance involves ‘exciting charged particles’ (you charge them for a ticketand then tell them they’ve won the prize). Becker said that the average strengthof the steady geomagnetic field varies from place to place across the UnitedStates and if you want to resonate a specific ion in a specific locality youwould require a specific frequency for that location. ‘The spacing of GWENtransmitters 200 miles apart across the United States would allow such specificfrequencies to be “tailored” to the geomagnetic-field strength in each GWENarea’ he said. These people are clearly not messing about. ELF/microwavetransmission towers of many and various kinds are being erected in countriesacross the world (Fig 749). Researcher David Jones wrote at RiseEarth.com:[../Images/00066.jpg]Figure 748: Receiver-transmitters are everywhere in the urban environment andincreasingly much further afield as the grid is constructed.> These mind control technologies have been in place for a long time.

TETRA is similar to the PCS/Digital, or Personal Communication Systemsused in the United States and is the communications network for the police andother emergency services introduced at great cost by the government of TonyBlair when what already existed was perfectly good enough (Fig 750). Policeofficers, firefighters and other government employees are zapped by theseelectromagnetic radiation fields, or ‘EMFs’, all day. They are justpeople-fodder like the TSA operatives in the US who are being cumulativelyirradiated by the leaking full-body scanners at airports. Motorola, the Americantelecommunications giant with close connections to the US National SecurityAgency (NSA), makes an important component of the TETRA system and the BritishGovernment awarded the TETRA contract to a consortium including British Telecombefore it was sold to O2 and its subsidiary mmO2. Concerns were expressed in aninternal European Union document that Motorola had been central to deciding theTETRA European standard to ensure that the US government could eavesdrop onTETRA communications. TETRA receives and transmits on frequencies within theband of human brain activity and as was said of the Soviet Woodpecker signal ...it was acting ‘like gangbusters ... right in the window of humanpsychoactivity’. Members of the emergency services are at great risk from TETRA.They are dosed with microwave radiation every time they use the equipment (asare those close to them, by the way). People living near TETRA masts haveconsistently reported illness, headaches, depression and all the commonconsequences of contact with powerful electromagnetic radiation fields. The‘green’ light bulbs trigger similar complaints and some people working in officeblocks deluged with electromagnetic fields suffer the same health effects.The global scale and coordination of what I am describing is fantastic, butdon’t worry because it’s all a coincidence. CNN told me."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00382.jpg]Changing the AtmosphereI cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think.SocratesAnother source of global electromagnetic radiation and perceptions of realitydelivered to the human mind is the High Frequency Active Auroral ResearchProgram (HAARP) based in Alaska with connecting centres being added around theworld.I have described HAARP at length in Remember Who You Are in the chapter ‘At Warwith the World’, but in summary it directs high-power radio waves (radiation)into the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere which deflects them back to earth(Fig 751). Construction of the HAARP facility on an Air Force-owned site nearGakona in Alaska began in 1993 and has been handled by a series of Archoncorporations and military operations over the years. HAARP is jointly funded bythe US Air Force, US Navy, University of Alaska and the satanic Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency (DARPA), the technology development arm of the USDepartment of Defense. The whole project is run for and by the military in itswar on human health and perception. The cover story is that HAARP is a researchproject to study the ionosphere which is like saying that a nuclear weapon is aresearch project to study loud noises. HAARP is actually a weapon of war used toartificially trigger earthquakes, manipulate the weather and target humanity inmyriad of ways mentally, emotionally and physically. Russia has the SuraIonospheric Heating Facility near the town of Vasilsursk and there are othersuch facilities around the world which, in the no-border realms of the Archonnetworks, will be working together to impose human enslavement and depopulation.The technology is based on the work of the incredible Serbian-born andCroatia-raised inventor, engineer and technological genius, Nikola Tesla(1856-1943). He once said: ‘The day science begins to study non-physicalphenomena it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previouscenturies of its existence.’ Tesla has been written out of mainstream historydespite discovering alternating current (AC) electricity which gave us theelectrical systems that we have today (Fig 752). Thomas Edison is awarded thecredit for electricity and electric light when Tesla beat him to it and eventhen Edison’s light was not invented by him but a minion on the payroll.Guglielmo Marconi, who worked for Tesla for nine months, is similarly creditedwith discovering radio communications, but the US Supreme Court ruled thatMarconi stole 14 of Tesla’s patents while claiming the data to be his own. Teslacould see the potential of his discoveries to track and locate objects (radar)and for X-raying the earth to see what lies within (a capability of HAARP).Bernard Eastlund, who secured the HAARP patents on behalf of ARCO PowerTechnologies Incorporated (APTI), a subsidiary of oil giant Atlantic Richfield,mentions Tesla in his HAARP submissions and what Tesla could do in the firsthalf of the 20th century HAARP can do today and more. So what could Tesla do?Well, he manipulated the weather, including lightning strikes above hislaboratory, and he could make the ground shake violently (Fig 753). On oneoccasion thousands of windows in the area were broken before he could turn offhis machine. His artificially-generated lighting storms unintentionally startedhundreds of forest fires and blew out electrical grids in two states. Tesla toldThe New York Times in 1940 that he had developed ‘an entirely new principle ofphysics’ which ‘no one ever dreamed about’. He called this the ‘teleforce’ anddescribed it as an invisible beam that could generate an invisible ‘Chinese Wallof Defence’ and ‘melt’ aircraft motors at a distance of 250 miles. The teleforcebeam was only one-hundred-millionth of a square centimetre in diameter, he said.Tesla was tapping into the natural electrical/electromagnetic forces andfocussing their power through technology. He said that he could produce 100million volts of pressure with currents up to 100 billion watts and if the radiofrequency was resonating at two Megahertz the energy released would be theequivalent of ten megatons of TNT. Tesla said that he had the technology to‘split the Earth like an apple’. New York American published an article in 1935with the headline ‘Tesla’s Controlled Earthquakes’ in which he said that histechnology’s ‘rhythmical vibrations pass through the Earth with almost no lossof energy ... [and it] becomes possible to convey mechanical effects to thegreatest terrestrial distances and produce all kinds of unique effects’.[../Images/00138.jpg]Figure 751: The potential for manipulation and destruction of the HAARPtechnology can hardly be overstressed.[../Images/00416.jpg]Figure 752: Nikola Tesla.[../Images/00053.jpg]Figure 753: Tesla designed technology that generated lightning strikes at willand made the ground shake violently.Earthquake? Press here ...Tesla could see the military potential of his inventions and acknowledged thathis teleforce could be used with devastating effect in war. This was not hisintention and he preferred to use his knowledge to provide everyone with freeenergy by harnessing naturally-occurring electrical and electromagnetic fields.This immediately had the Archon networks turn against him with a vengeance. Freeenergy, along with interest-free money, is their worst nightmare because of itsdevastating effect on both their income and control. Have any of these Greenfanatics pressing for Agenda 21 to ‘save the planet’ ever to stopped to ask whythe rich and famous families behind Agenda 21 are the same families that havesuppressed free energy for everyone without generating any CO2? No, they haven’tbecause 99 percent of them will (a) have no idea that these families are behindGreen fascism and Agenda 21; (b) have no idea that such pollution-free energy ispossible whenever we choose to tap into it; and (c) will never have heard ofNikola Tesla who built the Wardenclyffe Tower, better known as the Tesla Tower,to demonstrate the potential to transmit energy without wires (Fig 754).Wireless technology is not good if it is within the frequency of human physical,mental and emotional activity but it is possible to safely exploit its potentialfor free energy at other frequencies. The tower was demolished in 1917 after theRothschild-controlled JP Morgan and others had withdrawn funding, and Tesla diedin poverty in a New York hotel room after his inventions had been hijacked,stolen and suppressed. Now Tesla’s work has re-manifested as HAARP whichconsists of some 180 antennas located in around 33 acres in Alaska (Fig 755).HAARP can focus incredibly powerful electromagnetic radio waves on a tiny pointin the ionosphere either continuously or in a pulsing form. This causes theionosphere to heat, bulge and resonate in sympathy with the beam and thisredirects the beam back to earth with immensely more power than the originalHAARP transmission. The interaction between the HAARP radio beam and theionosphere can deliver more than 3.6 billion watts. HAARP can broadcast on thesame wavelength generated by earthquakes and so cause them by directing thatfrequency at a specific target. The earth then becomes ‘entrained’ orsynchronised to the beam and starts to resonate in sympathy. Strange lights andrainbow colours have been seen in the sky in recent years before earthquakeshappen and the atmosphere heats up before these engineered quakes because thisis what HAARP does – heats the ionosphere and then transfers this to thereflected beam directed at the earth. There were concentric heat rings above theseabed location of the Japanese ‘tsunami’ earthquake in 2011 and a rapid heatingof the ionosphere directly over the epicentre. This was confirmed by datareleased by Dimitar Ouzounov and his team at the NASA Goddard Space FlightCenter in Maryland and published in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) magazine, Technology Review, which reported how ‘infrared emissions abovethe epicenter increased dramatically in the days before the devastatingearthquake in Japan’ (Fig 756). The reported magnitude 9.03 quake was the mostpowerful to strike Japan and one of the five most powerful in the world sincerecords began in 1900. The resulting tsunami killed 15,880 people with 6,135injured and 2,694 people missing presumed dead. 129,225 buildings collapsed and254,204 were severely damaged (Fig 757). I will come to the reason for thisHAARP-generated horror shortly and few by this stage in the book will surelyquestion that the Archontic mentality would have any emotional consequences forcausing such colossal death and destruction. It is after all their calling card.Nor was the Japanese quake a one-off. The French DEMETER spacecraft (the namestands for Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from EarthquakeRegions) is being used to investigate ionosphere disturbances caused by seismicand volcanic activity. The Earth is affected by changes in the ionosphere andthe ionosphere is affected by activity on the ground. HAARP hacks into thisrelationship to do its dastardly deeds. DEMETER recorded a significant increasein ultra-low frequency radio signals before the magnitude 7 Haiti earthquake inJanuary 2010 which I said at the time was engineered to allow the takeover ofHaiti and its resources on land and offshore (see Remember Who You Are). Thishas since happened while virtually nothing has been done for the homeless anddestitute people. DEMETER recorded ‘a significant increase in ultra-lowfrequency radio signals’ and it just so happens that this is what HAARP isgenerating. Another scientist pointed out that ‘one hour before an earthquake inJapan and the one in Chile in 2002 there were more electrons coming through theionosphere – this is a very strange phenomenon’. Scientists have no idea wherethe heating comes from and can only speculate. Try HAARP.[../Images/00376.jpg]Figure 754: Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower.[../Images/00249.jpg]Figure 755: The HAARP antennas in Alaska.[../Images/00239.jpg]Figure 756: Infrared emissions above the quake epicentre in Japan increaseddramatically in the days leading up to the disaster.[../Images/00028.jpg]Figure 757: The quake-generated tsunami produced extraordinary devastation.Owning the weatherThe Archon networks use HAARP energy in another way to change weather systemsand engineer hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or torrential rain and you canmaintain the weather system for as long as you continue the same energeticmanipulation (Fig 758). The dances and rituals of Native Americans and othertribal peoples could generate an electromagnetic field that caused rain cloudsto form – the so-called ‘rain dances’. There are even companies advertising‘weather made to order’ and there have been international treaties banningweather manipulation. These include the United Nations Convention on theProhibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental ModificationTechniques (ENMOD). Why would they have treaties banning the manipulation of theweather if it was not possible? Dr Richard Day, the Rockefeller insider whopredicted in 1969 that the weather would be modified and used as a weapon of warto create drought or famine, was involved in weather modification during WorldWar II. What is the Bill Gates lunacy of releasing sulphur into the atmosphereif not an attempt to change weather patterns? Remember the killer floods atLynmouth in North Devon when the Royal Air Force did something similar withsulphur in 1952. William S Cohen (Rothschild Zionist), US Secretary of Defensefrom 1997 to 2001, said that forces were ‘engaging even in an eco-type terrorismwhereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes and volcanoes remotelythrough the use of electromagnetic waves’, but what he didn’t say is that his‘side’ had this capability. Record snow storms to melt into the flooding of theMissouri and Mississippi in 2011 that allowed the Archontics to acquire the landof family farms? Piece of cake. Hurricanes or whole forests of tornadoes in theMidwest of America in 2011 which killed hundreds and targeted rural communities?Ditto. Record droughts in the United States in 2012 to again damage or destroyindependent farmers and growers? Ditto. The constant torrential rain which didthe same to farmers in Britain in 2012? Ditto. Devastating and record-breakingfloods in Pakistan, a country the Archon families want to destabilise andtakeover? Ditto. Whenever you like, mate, just give us a call. Three hundredtornadoes struck the Midwest and North East United States in three days in April2011 causing 300 deaths with 118 tornadoes in 24 hours at one stage. This is notnatural; it is HAARP targeting the lands and communities that the Archonnetworks want to seize under Agenda 21. One UK newspaper report about foodprices and shortages said in 2012: ‘This combination of freak weather [in theUS, UK and Russia] has led to one of the worst global harvests in years.’ Yes,all planned and all thanks to HAARP and other weather manipulating technologies.Earthquake creation and weather manipulation is not possible? One governmentinsider said that HAARP could deliver enough power to make the Earth flip over.This brings into perspective my view that the great cataclysmic events in thesolar system were artificially generated by destabilising the balance ofelectromagnetic fields holding planets and dwarf stars in their orbits (rememberthe enormous electromagnetic vehicles observed by Norman Bergrun). Patents andassociated documents say that HAARP has the capability to:[../Images/00418.jpg]Figure 758: Hurricanes on demand.> • Deliver unprecedented amounts of energy at specific locations in the> atmosphere that are far more precise than a nuclear weapon.> • Interfere with global communications systems while HAARP communications> remain unaffected.> • Block incoming missiles.> • Manipulate weather.> • Manipulate the atmosphere by changing the molecular composition of an> atmospheric region.> • Create nuclear-sized explosions without radiation using electromagnetic> pulses.> • Allow for over-the-horizon radar.[../Images/00166.jpg]Figure 759: HAARP has so many uses.In other words, it makes nuclear weapons obsolete. HAARP could easily explainthe strange mass deaths of birds, animals and fish which have inexplicably diedin large numbers, including birds in flight (Fig 759). It could explain howaircraft have simply fallen out of the sky without any reports of difficultiesor technical malfunction (Tesla said that his teleforce could melt aircraftengines from 250 miles away and there would be no limit today because of theionosphere reflection). HAARP can X-ray the earth to locate oil and otherresources and with Archon corporations given access to this information theirrivals have no chance of competing. This means that the Archon networks knowwhat lies beneath countries while governments often do not. Countries like Haitican be targeted with earthquakes to allow their takeover to secure resourcesthat only the Archon bloodlines know are there. After the engineered earthquakein Haiti which allowed the United States and United Nations to move in we hadprecious metals worth potentially over $20 billion ‘discovered’. Geologists havelocated at least a million ounces of gold, between 20 million and 30 millionounces of silver and copious amounts of copper. HAARP X-rays can also locateanyone hiding underground, as well as underground military facilities andstockpiles of hidden weapons – but they couldn’t find Osama bin Laden in a cavein Afghanistan or confirm that Iraq did not have a cache of ‘weapons of massdestruction’?? HAARP is subject to no oversight by anyone and it is a law untoitself. Only a few people worldwide will have even heard of it and the same goesfor politicians. When they do raise concerns they are treated with contempt bythe military. The European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Securityand Disarmament investigated HAARP in the early 1990s and requested theappearance of NATO and United States representatives to discuss its potentialeffect. They simply refused. The subsequent European Parliament report said:> ... [With its] far-reaching impact on the environment, HAARP is a matter of> global concern and we have to ask whether its advantages really outweigh the> risks ... The environmental impact and the ethical aspect must be closely> examined before any further research and testing takes place ... HAARP is a> project of which the public is almost completely unaware, and this needs to be> remedied.None of this has happened because the agenda demands that it does not happen.The military is funded by taxpayers but it can choose to ignore the politicalsystem that is supposed (supposed) to represent those taxpayers. Politicians areonly there to kid the people that they don’t live in a tyranny, but we do and itis run by the militarycorporate-Intelligence monster with the Archon bloodlinesat the helm and the Archons orchestrating from the shadows. The EuropeanParliament report also said: ‘HAARP could result in changes in weather patterns.It could also influence whole ecosystems, especially in the sensitive Antarcticregions.’ This is happening and when we experience HAARP-generated weather theeffect is blamed on ‘global warming’ or human-caused ‘climate change’. Twobirds, one stone. One long-term concern about HAARP and weather is that it hasthe ability to manipulate the jet streams which are narrow, fast flowing aircurrents and the major ones manifest as winds moving from west to east. Theirstability is crucial to stable weather patterns and they are caused by acombination of the Earth’s rotation and atmospheric heating that HAARP canclearly manipulate. Weather scientists at the London Met Office said that thecause of the summer of floods in Britain in 2012 was the strange behaviour ofthe jet streams which were preventing rain clouds from moving across and awayfrom the UK and instead held them there to continually deluge the country.Britain also faced extremely heavy out-of-season snow made worse by strong windsin the run up to Easter 2013 which continued for weeks. I was looking at the BBCwebsite one day amid all this and saw a headline indicating a video in which theMet Office was going to explain why it was happening. I had the term ‘jetstream’ in my mind already as I started the video and there was the chap withhis map explaining that the snow and bitter winds at the turn of ‘spring’ werecaused by the jet stream moving much further south than usual. But the same daya bloke called Professor Sir John Beddington, the outgoing government chiefclimate advisor, was telling the BBC that urgent action was needed to tackle‘global warming’ to stop extremes of weather like the snow. He said: ‘In a sensewe have moved from the idea of global warming to the idea of climate change, andthat is rather important – yes, indeed, temperatures are increasing but thething that is going to happen is that we are going to see much more variabilityin our weather.’ Where do I start? The reason that ‘we’ have moved from globalwarming to climate change is because global warming stopped and so was no longertenable. His comment that yes, indeed, temperatures are increasing is eitherintended to mislead or ignorance that defies the imagination given his job. Evenofficial figures agree that temperatures are about the same now as they were in1997. In terms of HAARP, we should also note that Norman Bergrun talked aboutthe weathermanipulation potential of his electromagnetic vehicles identified byhim around Saturn and by others elsewhere, including the Sun:> Quite conceivably, electromagnetic vehicles could be generators of tornadoes> and hurricanes. In certain instances, inexplicable, sudden, intense fires also> might be attributable to these space-craft. A likely simple example is> transformer fires at the top of power poles. A much more subtle possibility> might be electromagnetic alteration of human body tissues in as much as> electrical fields attendant with vehicles can extend over thousands of miles.> Of these possibilities, weather is the easiest with which to relate.One other point about HAARP. The technology has the potential to projectholographic images into the sky that look like the ‘real thing’ (which is alsoholographic). These images could relate to a fake alien invasion or projectreligious heroes to manipulate mass perception and behaviour. Both are includedin the brief of a US military operation called Project Blue Beam. I have giventhe background to this in other books or you can put those words into a searchengine to see what this is all about in more detail. There have been somereports of religious deities like Mother Mary appearing in the sky and thesecould well be practice runs to see how many believe them to be real – lots itseems (Fig 760). Put ‘Virgin Mary Appears in Africa Sky Bluebeam Warning’ into asearch engine. Laboratory Equipment magazine reported in March 2013 that USNaval Research Laboratory (NRL) research physicists and engineers from thePlasma Physics Division had successfully employed HAARP to produce a sustainedhigh-density plasma cloud in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Paul Bernhardt fromthe NRL Space Use and Plasma Section, said: ‘Previous artificial plasma densityclouds have lifetimes of only ten minutes or less ... This higher density plasma“ball” was sustained over one hour by the HAARP transmissions and wasextinguished only after termination of the HAARP radio beam.’ There is noquestion that HAARP can be used to simulate ‘natural’ phenomena to fool peopleon the ground. American aerospace executive Dr Carol Rosin worked in the 1970swith Dr Wernher von Braun, the German rocket scientist who was employed by NASAafter the Second World War. She revealed that when he knew he was dying ofcancer he told her of the plan to introduce a series of fake enemies to justifythe weaponisation of space (and a lot more than that if the full truth be told).He said that these enemies and dangers would be, in order: the Soviet Union;terrorists; Third World country ‘crazies’ – ‘countries of concern’ as they arecalled today; asteroids; and a threat of an ‘alien’ invasion. Von Braun told hernot to believe any of this when it happened because it would all be ‘a lie and ahoax’. The list has been ticked off one by one up to ‘countries of concern’ andin February 2013 we were told that a huge asteroid with the potential to causemass devastation had past the Earth by just 15,000 miles or ‘15 minutes’. On thesame day we were told that a meteorite had struck Russia injuring a thousandpeople (Fig 761). The media then ran stories about a team of astronomers inColombia claiming to have tracked the origin of the ‘meteorite’ to the ‘Apolloasteroid cluster’ from which have come more than 5,000 of the 9,700 near-Earth‘space rocks’ that have been discovered. The reports indicated that this wouldmean more were likely to threaten the Earth. We should question everything andwatch for the asteroid/meteorite hype and some phoney ‘alien’ invasion.[../Images/00096.jpg]Figure 760: ‘Mother Mary’ flies in.[../Images/00370.jpg]Figure 761: What was said to be the Russian meteorite.Irradiating the atmosphere and entraining your mindAnother role for HAARP is to deliver mind control programming en masse withinthe frequency band of human brain activity through Extremely Low Frequency orELF waves. Everything in this reality is a frequency, including thoughts,emotions and feelings. If you broadcast on those frequencies and entrain themwith the human energy fields you can trigger those thoughts, emotions andfeelings. More than sixty years ago Dr Andrija Puharich, an American medical andparapsychological researcher, identified certain frequencies and theirpsyche/emotional consequence. He said that 10.80 Hertz produces ‘riotousbehaviour’ and 6.6 Hz makes people depressed while psychics operate at 8 Hz whenthey are ‘out there’. The US military among others have developed technology tobreak the enemy’s spirit by targeting them mentally and emotionally through suchfrequency technology. You want to start a riot as a Problem-Reaction-Solution orto undermine a country’s government? Broadcast frequencies at 10.80 Hz. You wantpeople depressed? 6.6 Hz. Dr Andrew Michrowski, a technologies specialist withthe Canadian Department of State, and president of the Planetary Association forClean Energy (PACE), said that virtually anything could be delivered externallyto the human mind to be processed as the person’s personal ‘words, phrases,images, sensations and emotions’. He’s right and this is why opening the limitedmind to limitless Consciousness is essential to block this infiltration ofperception. Awareness of it alone is enough to put up considerable barriersbecause it is no longer happening purely in the subconscious where people can belike a boxer in the ring with his hands by his sides. Make the conscious mindaware of something and the guard comes up by the very state of being aware. Bythe time you finish this book you are going to be far, far less open toperception manipulation just by reading the information and becoming aware ofwhat is happening. The United States, Russia, Britain and China have beenrunning extensive research programmes into mass mind control techniques – for atleast 70 years in the case of the first three. I have written extensively aboutmind control potential and techniques in other books such as The Biggest Secretand The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy. Mind control is simply anextreme form of perception deception and so at the core of the entireconspiracy. We are like electromagnetic ‘fish’ swimming in an electromagneticsea (Fig 762). What happens to the sea happens to the fish. How do you targetall fish at the same time? You target the sea. How do you target all humans atthe same time? You target the energetic sea. There are four major goals behindthe electromagnetic field conspiracy:[../Images/00187.jpg]Figure 762: Electromagnetic ‘fish’ in an electromagnetic sea.> • To demolish human health as part of the planned mass population cull and> this is being done in association with all the other methods I have described.> • To synchronise or ‘entrain’ brainwave activity with electromagnetic> communication fields so that thoughts and perceptions can be fed directly into> the human mind, individually and collectively.> • To create such an electromagnetic distortion of the human body and the> Earth’s energy ‘sea’ that we become isolated in five-sense reality,> disconnected from an influence from expanded states of awareness, and all> thought and perception is delivered by the overt and covert information> sources of the system.> • To change the Earth’s atmosphere and electromagnetic state to make it more> compatible with the Archon entities that are ultimately behind it all.

They include the wireless Internet;computers and wireless keyboards; Smart Meters; ‘green’ light bulbs; irradiatedfood; microwave ovens; power lines; full-body scanners, overuse of X-rays andCAT scanners; depleted uranium released from US and NATO weapons unleashed oncivilian and other targets; cell phones; iPads and electronic books; cell phonetowers; other communication towers such as GWEN and TETRA; remote controls ofall kinds, covertly through HAARP and so on. Radioactive pollution from depleteduranium weapons is causing terrible and widespread birth defects in the targetcountries and troops subjected to the consequences of their own weaponry willsuffer the same health consequences from the radiation that remains dangerousfor 4.5 billion years and moves on the wind systems all over the world. Thenthere is the unanswered question about the scale of radiation being directed atthe Earth from the satellite network. I cringe when I hear sports coaches andmanagers saying this player or that is ‘going for a scan’ to see the extent ofan injury. These famous sports people are going to reap the whirlwind of thislater in life if they are not careful. Published studies suggest that some25,000 Americans develop cancer every year from sources of medical radiation andit is responsible for damage to DNA (a constantly recurring consequence of thesystem’s attacks on the human mind and body). There is even a designated illnessknown as electromagnetic field intolerance or electromagnetic hypersensitivitycaused by all these sources of radiation. Dr Dominique Belpomme, a Frenchprofessor of oncology who has made a study with others of this problem, saidthat radiation has major effects on the brain including the breaching of theblood-brain barrier which ‘allows mercury, organochlorines and other pollutantsto enter the brain, where they cause various neurodegenerative diseases’. My ownbooks were eventually released with great reluctance in electronic form becauseso many read that way these days and the information must get out to as manypeople as possible; but my hope is that reading about electromagnetic pollutionhere will have people returning to paper books. Yes, it is more convenient tohave lots of books on one device, as it is convenient to have a phone in yourpocket or talk to people wherever you are, but what is more important,convenience or health? ‘Wireless’ is now the communication system of choice andthis is being brought about by the bloodline networks to incessantly irradiatethe atmosphere. When the agenda is involved the authorities push on regardlessof consequences for people and laws are passed to stop anyone blocking itsadvance. The 1999 Telecommunications Act introduced by the ClintonAdministration prevents local authorities from banning the location oftelecommunication and cell phone masts anywhere so long as they comply with theregulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FFC) which is controlledby the Archontics. They are systematically placed on or near schools, malls,colleges, office blocks, housing estates, on blocks of flats, cinemas, healthclinics and sports venues by councils and companies selling the space at theexpense of the health and lives of those whose best interests they claim toserve. The jails are full of people for crimes that don’t come even close tothis slow-burn mass murder. Many masts these days are hidden or disguised assomething else (Fig 763). The towers are far more powerful in their radiationtransmission than is needed for cell phone communications because they areactually part of a gathering radiation field designed for mass mind control.Together they create yet another grid or ‘bubble’ network (Fig 764).Firefighters in the United States have tried to have a section of theTelecommunications Act repealed to stop the towers being located on firestations, but to no avail. I often see the roofs of apartment blocks covered intelecommunication towers and this is highly dangerous for the residents withchildren especially at risk from the effects of radiation; but the evil behindthis couldn’t give a damn what effect it has on people and their children oranyone else so long as the effect is the one they desire. It is testament to howhigh in the governing structure the ignorance of what is really happening goeswhen you have government officials agreeing to the siting of communicationtowers on their own buildings and then happily working in them oblivious of thepotential consequences (until it is too late).[../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 763: Hiding the evidence.[../Images/00306.jpg]Figure 764: Creating the reality ‘bubble’.Get off the bloody phoneA YouTube film by television presenter James Russell entitled Resonance – Beingsof Frequency documents the dramatic transformation of the human electromagneticenvironment in a ridiculously short time. The human electromagnetic field isbeing bombarded by ever-increasing sources of technological electromagnetism andthe result is a disaster for ‘physical’, mental and emotional health. This isnot rocket science only an obvious, predictable cause and effect. Russell’s filmopens with a statistic to set the scene for the scale of change that has takenplace in little more than 25 years. In the mid-1980s less than three percent ofpeople were using cell phones. Now, especially in the so-called ‘developedworld’ (I beg to differ), the figure is far closer to 100 percent with billionsof phones in use. This is happening when people have no idea of the long-termconsequences (although surely a village idiot could have a good shot at it).Well, actually, it would be more accurate so say that the population, medical‘professionals’ and most personnel in the cell phone industry have no idea.Those truly behind all this know only too well what the consequences will be andfor many already are. After all, the consequences are what this is really about.Cell phones communicate in the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum –the same as microwave ovens that further irradiate already irradiated ‘food’ anddestroy nutrients to the point where it is no longer ‘food’ but only a substancethat stops you being hungry for a while. Would anyone think it was safe to put amicrowave oven to their head? This is in principle what people do when they holda cell phone to their ear and I even see everyone from supermarket staff to taxidrivers and business people with cell phone devices permanently attached totheir ear the entire working day. Such is the power of cognitive dissonance – astate of holding two or more conflicting beliefs at the same time and believingboth to be true. In this case I am putting microwaves to my brain and microwavesare extremely dangerous to my brain, but I won’t be harmed. In fact, look atthat statement in relation to my ‘coldly calculated’ theme with Archon networks.You want to create a mobile communications network which involves people puttingyour technology to their heads and you think that using one of the mostdangerous sections of the electromagnetic spectrum is the best way to do it. Cansome people be that stupid? Yes, of course, but the entire combination of globalgovernments, corporations, medicine, science and ‘safety’ regulators?? All ofthese professions do stupid, but are we saying that somewhere within thatentirety it wasn’t known what the potential consequences would be? No way. Therewas no need to use this microwave segment of the electromagnetic spectrum – itwas selected because research and experience had shown how destructive it was tohuman health. Barrie Trower, a retired British military intelligence scientist,has long experience in microwave warfare. I have quoted him in other books withregard to the effects of the TETRA system of communication for emergencyservices. He explained why the microwave frequencies were employed for cellphones:> During the 1950s and 1960s during the Cold War, it was realised by accident> that microwaves could be used as stealth weapons when the Russians beamed the> American embassy during the Cold War and it gave everybody working in the> embassy cancer, breast cancers, leukemias whatever, and it was realised then> that low level microwaves were the perfect stealth weapon to be used on> dissident groups around the world, because you could make dissident groups> sick, give them cancer, change their mental outlook on life without them even> knowing they were being radiated.> The electromagnetic spectrum is a band that goes from gamma rays and x-rays at> one end, the very high energy waves, and it comes down through visible light,> which is also some radiation, and then it goes through infrared microwaves, TV> and radio. Now the only ones which really affect us in the communications> industry are the microwaves, and microwaves have a special ability to> interfere with water, which is how microwave ovens work, and we are made of> water.> All of our chemical and electrical signals involve water in the body, somehow,> electrical communications in the body. So, the industry has picked the worst> possible part of the electromagnetic spectrum to give to young children and to> adults.This is by design and not through stupidity or coincidence. The point thatTrower makes about water is a telling one and there are many other calculatedand concerted attacks on the body’s biological water including food additivesand the incredibly high salt intake hidden within processed foods.The attack on human health through cell phones speaks for itself. When you put acell phone to your ear you immediately start to heat up that side of the brainand the longer the call continues the hotter it gets (Fig 765). Experiments ledby Dr Nora D Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in theUnited States, revealed that the brain is adversely affected at microwave levelswell below the official and as always stupid ‘safe limits’. Most parents are soignorant of the risks that the average age of children now being given cellphones is just eight years old. Yet children are far more in danger from cellphones than even adults because they have thinner skulls. ‘Safe’ limits oneverything from radiation to food additives are not set on the basis of safetyfor human health. They are set at a level that allows the corporate worldcontrolled by the same networks as the governments setting the limits to doalmost whatever they like. The corporations and their lobbyists tell governmentsthe limit they can live with and still peddle their wares and governments setthe limits just above that. If new technology is ready to be introduced thatwould breach the limits, well, that’s no problem. Governments raise the limit tomake it legal. A far more awake scientist says in James Russell’s film that ifyou want to make sure that no one ever breaks the speed limit then you set it at1,000 miles an hour. American singer and songwriter Sheryl Crow said that herbrain tumour was possibly caused by spending a lot of time on a cell phone overmany years with the tumour appearing on the side of the head where she mostlyheld the phone. Her doctors will not apparently even entertain the possibilityof a connection, but then they’re just bloody idiots who either don’t, or don’twant to, acknowledge the obvious potential correlation. I refer to cell phonesas the ‘silent holocaust’ because the cumulative effect on human health,especially among those who start young, is going to be catastrophic. Thebloodlines know this and it is part of their culling of the population. This andother reasons explain why reports and studies questioning the safety of cellphones and their towers are ignored no matter what their findings when thebreathtakingly obvious consequences of putting a microwave field next to thebrain for sometimes hours a day is clear for all (Conscious people) to see. Thealleged safety of mobile phones is measured by something called SAR (SpecificAbsorption Rate) which claims to identify how much electromagnetic energy isabsorbed by the human body in terms of the heating effect. The SAR limit isabsolute nonsense in terms of safety and yet many of the most popular mobilephones are right on the SAR maximum. This is clearly going to be cumulativelydeadly for large numbers of people for a reason I am about to explain. The SARlimit is set by using the ‘SAM phantom head’ (Fig 766). This is an artificial‘skull’ based on the average head characteristics of 10,000 people, but not justany people. This is important because the bigger and thicker the skull the moreprotection is given to the brain from mobile phone radiation. The SAM head isbased on ‘randomly’ selected (sure, okay) US military personnel who, as Russellpoints out in his film, will have rather bigger and thicker skulls than that ofan eight-year-old (Fig 767). The SAR ‘safety’ rating does not take this in toaccount and the brains of children using mobile phones are being subjected toradiation levels way beyond even the insane official SARS limit every time theyuse a phone. ‘Safety’ standards are overseen (it says here) by theindustry-biased International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection(ICNIRP), or, more appropriately in my view, ICTWERP. This organisation and theterms ‘useless’ and ‘irrelevant’ are interchangeable. It does not take intoaccount all the potential effects on the brain and human body of invasiveelectromagnetic fields and only concentrates on the heating effect. Even then itsupports limits that are demonstrably dangerous. Another mobile phone ‘safetyand protection’ organisation is the UK-based Mobile Telecommunications andHealth Research (MTHR). Putting the word ‘research’ in its name is a bit likethose brutal African tyrants and dictators who rule through violence and terrorand yet call themselves a ‘democratic front’. The name is for show and to give afalse perception of reality and it’s the same with the MTHR which is jointlyfunded by the cell phone industry and the UK government which are basically thesame thing. MTHR funded a notoriously-rigged ‘scientific’ study in 2007 designedfrom start to finish to cover up the obvious cause and effect between cell phonetechnology and damage to human health. So many ‘scientists’ are nothing of thesort. They are just souls for sale to anyone who wants to fund them on the basisthat the outcome of the research is agreed before it even begins. It is clearlyno coincidence that industry-funded ‘research’ into cell phone dangers tend tosay they are safe while genuinely independent studies say the opposite. TheMTHR-funded study concluded that the symptoms of people claiming to be affectedby phone masts and other electromagnetic technology were all in the mind. Oneresearcher said: ‘I’m pretty confident that it’s not the electromagnetic fieldcausing these symptoms.’ I’m more than pretty confident that she’s talkingcomplete bollocks.[../Images/00152.jpg]Figure 765: The heating effect on the right around the ear and forehead of a 15minute cell phone call.[../Images/00159.jpg]Figure 766: The ‘SAM phantom head’.[../Images/00408.jpg]Figure 767: The same phones tested as ‘safe’ (joke) on thick adult skulls areused by children with far thinner skulls.Closing the Third EyeWe are only now beginning to see the long-term effects of mobile phone usebecause cancers can take ten years or more to form and cell phone use onlyreally became widespread in the 1990s. Most alleged ‘studies’ don’t take thistimescale into account and so they must by definition reach flawed conclusions.Certainly the industry is aware of this because they have started to add someguidelines and warnings in the small print with future legal action in mind. DrLennart Hardell, professor in oncology and cancer epidemiology at the UniversityHospital in Orebro, Sweden, headed the most comprehensive research so far on theconnection between mobile phones and cancer. The study involved 2,000 peoplewith brain cancer and when their level of cell phone use was taken into accountit was clear that these phones significantly increase the risk of brain tumours.Using a mobile phone close to the brain is nothing more than slow-motionsuicide, but the health effects go much deeper even than this. Technologicalelectromagnetism once again targets the pineal gland in the centre of the brainand also our circadian rhythms, the natural daily cycles of the body in livingorganisms which regulate sleep patterns, hormone production, brain waveactivity, cell regeneration and the day-night cycle. Serious illness can ensueif these rhythms are significantly disrupted. Jet lag is an example of whathappens when circadian rhythms are scrambled. The pineal gland is little biggerthan a grain of rice but its importance to life, awareness, health and circadianpatterns is fundamental. Crucially, the pineal synthesises and secretes thehormone melatonin, but only when it’s dark. The pineal is extremelylight-sensitive and the less light there is the more it will produce melatoninwhich is vital to many functions including mopping up cancer cells during sleep.This is why it is important to sleep in a room that is as dark as you can makeit. Sleeping with the light on, even a night light, or in the light of a streetlamp outside, inhibits melatonin production and studies have revealed theincreased chance of cancer for those who work night shifts and sleep during theday when it is almost impossible to reproduce the darkness of night time. Nonight-time sleep, no significant melatonin. Night working also disruptscircadian rhythms in general for obvious reasons. The average woman with breastcancer has only one tenth of the melatonin for a woman of her age and men withprostate cancer have less than half the normal levels of melatonin. It is thesame story with autistic children. During the hours of darkness the brainrepairs cell damage and replaces the half a billion cells lost each day, andmelatonin is central to this. It is also an extremely powerful antioxidant thatdeals with millions of free radicals – electrons left over in the repair process– which attack healthy cells. Melatonin is a natural anti-cancer and anti-agingagent and when melatonin levels fall it can lead to immune deficiency, sleepdisturbance and heart problems among much else. Melatonin production is crucialto life and health, but even sleeping in the dark may not be sufficient if youare being influenced by electromagnetic fields generated by the gathering tidalwave of technological sources. The reason is this: To the pineal gland ‘light’or darkness are electromagnetic triggers. It is the frequency difference betweenlight and dark that activates the production or non-production of melatonin.‘Light’ and ‘dark’ are different states of electromagnetism and this is whatswitches melatonin secretion on and off and not what we perceive as the visualdifference between ‘light’ or ‘no light’. This is highly relevant becausetechnologically-produced electromagnetism can trick the pineal gland intobelieving it is still day time even in the dead of night and when this happensmelatonin production remains dormant. Research has confirmed that this is indeedthe case and it is the same with animals and insects. Electromagnetic fields canblock the production of melatonin. What is happening withtechnologicallygenerated electromagnetic fields is not a slight disturbance ofthe prevailing order, but something never seen in known human history. It is aninsane experiment with human life itself, but really it is not even anexperiment for those deep in the shadows. They set out to make this happen.Out of sync with SchumannThe Earth and the human Body-Mind are supposed to be in harmony through theircompatible frequencies. The planet’s electromagnetic resonance is known asSchumann Cavity Resonance after the man who discovered it, the German physicistWinfried Otto Schumann. The ‘cavity’ refers to the electromagnetic environmentbetween the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere. Schumannresonance occupies the extremely low frequency or ELF range between 6 and 8Hertz. This is the same as human brain activity and all biological systems ...and HAARP and the communication technology that I am describing. Scientists saythat Earth and brain come together at 7.83 Hz which is the frequency of Schumannresonance and human alpha waves broadcast by the brain in states of meditation,relaxation and creativity (Fig 768). These waves also regulate anxiety, stressand the immune system. All this must be so because every part of a hologram is asmaller version of the whole. The Earth is a mini-universe and the human body isa mini-Earth/universe. You would expect in that case for the planet and the bodyto be in resonant harmony and there are other reasons for this, too. Thefrequency of 7.83 Hz is the mutual resonance of biological life and for instancedolphins generate sound waves of 7.83 Hz. Dr Herbert König, Schumann’s successorat Munich University, established that the dominant brain wave in mammals isbetween 6 and 8 Hz. There is a prevailing frequency order that connects lifeinto one unified frequency field and communication is possible between speciesin the form of information fields or thought waves. The Archon Control Systemmanipulates through distorting the natural order by disturbing in multiple waysthrough the manipulation of the Earth’s electromagnetic field. SchumannResonance operates like a tuning fork to ‘entrain’ all biological life in acommon and harmonious oscillation. The entrainment of brain activity by externalstimulus is called the Frequency Following Response (FFR). The brain can beentrained by frequencies generated by technology, including music if the rhythmis constant and powerful enough. Entrainment then opens the door to access andinfluence human thought and perception. This is what is happening with thecurrent maze of electromagnetic receiver-transmitter technology infesting humansociety and increasing by the day. They are building a frequency prisonstep-by-step and crucial to hijacking the human mind is to disconnect the brainand body from their default setting – harmony with the planet’s electromagneticresonance. Studies highlighted in James Russell’s film confirm that thatSchumann resonance is being swamped by the electromagnetic fog or soup nowgenerated by technology. The human frequency starts to wander like a little boylost once this happens and a whole range of interconnected consequences canfollow on multiple levels of mind, body and emotion. Physicist Wolfgang Ludwigsaid: ‘Measuring Schumann resonance in or around a city has become impossible... electromagnetic pollution from cell phones has forced us to makemeasurements at sea.’ People have quickly shown physical, mental and emotionaleffects when they have been technologically disconnected from Schumann resonanceto test for consequences. As one media report said:[../Images/00084.jpg]Figure 768: The realm of Schumann Cavity Resonance.> Professor R. Wever from the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in> Erling-Andechs ... built an underground bunker which completely screened out> magnetic fields [Schumann resonance] and housed student volunteers for four> weeks in this hermetically-sealed environment.> Wever noted that the student’s circadian rhythms diverged and that they> suffered emotional distress and migraine headaches. Symptoms disappeared after> a brief exposure to 7.8 Hz. Similar complaints were reported by the first> astronauts and cosmonauts, who, out in space, were also deprived of Schumann> waves.French virologist Luc Montagnier was joint winner of the Nobel Prize forPhysiology or Medicine in 2008 for identifying the ‘HIV virus’, but even moreground-breaking was his ‘discovery’ that DNA communicates through extremely lowfrequency electromagnetic waves at a frequency of ... 7.83 Hz. I challenge thefact that he actually was the first to discover this connection because othersoutside the scientific mainstream were aware of this much earlier and Idiscussed this very phenomenon of DNA communication in my 2003 book, InfiniteLove is the Only Truth – Everything Else Is Illusion. This was years beforeMontagnier announced his findings and others had been aware of the process evenlonger before that. Montagnier was, however, the first mainstream scientist tomake these claims publicly and that is significant in itself given the concreteblock that is most of mainstream science. Montagnier’s findings were predictablydismissed by many of this ilk, but they remain true all the same. This meansthat technologically-generated electromagnetic fields can disrupt the frequencycommunications of DNA and so distort the human genetic structure and triggermutation and even block the continuation of human life replication. This isprecisely what the crazies are seeking to do.Where am I?Birds, insects, animals and humans have a compass that interacts with theEarth’s magnetic fields and central to this process is the cryptochrome moleculewhich again regulates circadian rhythms and the day-night melatonin cycle.Cryptochromes also allow a number of species, including humans, to sense andnavigate magnetic fields. This was confirmed by ground-breaking research withrobins by Thorsten Ritz, professor of physics and astronomy at the University ofCalifornia. Cryptochromes are the reason that birds and mammals like whales canmigrate long distances and then return without a map in sight. Cryptochromesalso give bees and other insects similar navigational gifts. We have had manyapparently inexplicable cases of whales and dolphins dying en masse afterbeaching themselves (Fig 769). It is clear to me from looking at the evidencethat this phenomenon is connected with electromagnetic disruption of theirnavigation systems. Physics professor Thorsten Ritz exposed birds to radiofrequency fields to test the effect on their navigational abilities. The resultsshowed that not only did the fields disrupt migration patterns but this happenedat very low intensities that were well below the official ‘safe’ public exposurelimits. This is the case with other animals and insects, too. A long list ofspecies dependent on their magnetic ‘compass’ have been in steep declineincluding birds, butterflies and, of course, bees. Colony collapse disorder isjust a fancy name for adult bees going away and not coming back and so leavingthe colony unable to function. We have discussed the Monsanto connection to thisbut there are likely to be other reasons including electromagnetic disturbances.Dr Jochen Kuhn of Koblenz-Landau University in Germany put a mobile ‘DECT’ phonewhich so many people have at home these days into four beehives. Another fourhives acted as the control group without a phone. A DECT phone is a mini versionof a mobile phone mast in the way it operates with the phone interacting withits ‘base station’. These masts are now everywhere in anything like an urbanenvironment and they are increasing all the time to reach ever more isolatedlocations. Dr Kuhn found that the bees in the four hives without the phonesreturned normally, but hardly any returned to the phone hives. Cryptochromes inhumans work in the same way as birds and insects. They allow for the instinctivenavigation of the planet’s electromagnetic field or what we call a ‘sense ofdirection’. When magnets have been attached to people’s heads in experimentsthis sense is distorted and the potential consequences are obvious as theelectromagnetic field becomes ever more distorted. The Russell film highlightsone small English village of only 18 houses located near a phone mast wherethere have been multiple cases of the same symptoms and diseases includingbreast and other cancers, fertility problems and severe headaches. Seventypercent of people in the village are estimated to have suffered from a range ofsimilar effects. Cancer clusters around phone masts in general are becoming evermore common, as is depression and other emotional imbalances. The same is trueof the debilitating illness known as electrosensitivity caused by the growingbarrage of electromagnetic fields. The symptoms include insomnia, vertigo,headache, seizures, endocrine dysfunction (often affecting the thyroid),internal bleeding and cancer. Some have to live in near isolation fromelectromagnetic technology because of the effect on their health. This ishappening without any credible official research into the consequences oftransforming the natural electromagnetic order in less than 25 years; and nor isthere any credible protection from those consequences.[../Images/00203.jpg]Figure 769: Whales and dolphins are dying en masse after beaching themselves.[../Images/00222.jpg]Figure 770: Radiation has increased by many millions of times in just 50 years.Electromagnetism has increased massively in such a short period. A document bythe former Radiological Protection Board said that the radiation environment hasincreased by many millions of times in just 50 years and that increase isgetting faster every day (Fig 770). Researchers are even struggling now to finda control population for scientific analysis to measure the effects accuratelybecause even if you don’t have a mobile phone or live near a mast you are stillbeing subjected to technological electromagnetism in some form. It is the silentkiller and the hidden manipulator of human perception. How could they haveproved that smoking causes cancer if everyone smoked? And remember that mobilephones only appeared in the 1980s and in any number in the 1990s. Where we areis not where they intend to stay. They want to push on and on with more phonesand masts every day, week and year. What I have been describing here is a majorpart of the planned mass cull of the global population which Control Systemdocuments demand is reduced from the current more than seven billion to anythingbetween one billion and half a billion. They are doing this withgeneticallymodified food, chemical additives in food and drink, fluoride indrinking water, chemtrail metals and poisons sprayed in the sky, vaccines,pharmaceutical drugs, removing sources of nutrition, euthanasia for the elderly(death panels and ‘pathways’), war, economic deprivation and hunger. The listgoes on and on and radiation is right up there. There are simple things thatpeople can do immediately to mitigate the effects and that includes ditching themobile phone and only using landlines – especially the socalled DECT phones athome that can easily be replaced by landlines. Anything wireless presents themost serious danger, including the wireless Internet and the wireless fieldsthat communicate with Smart Meters (which need to be vehemently resisted andrefused). If you don’t think you can live without a mobile then at least use itas sparingly as possible for only short conversations and save any long chatsfor landlines. When you do use a mobile never put it to your ear and only usethe speaker as far away as possible and research the best protection coversavailable. You can use earphones to keep incoming speaker chat private. Mostimportantly never, never, never let a mobile phone near a child. Any switched-onmobile is not good, but by far the greatest danger comes from putting them toyour ear. I have explained the dangers to people that I see with a mobile unitpermanently attached to their ear, but they just say that it’s a more efficientway to do their work. Will they be saying this when the work ends with thewords: ‘I am sorry to tell you that you have a brain tumour’? I have a mobilefor absolute emergencies when there is no other way to make contact with someonein the timescale necessary, but 99.999 percent of the time it is in a drawer andnot switched on.I only text when I do use it except for extremely rare calls ofno more than one or two a month at most which are always via the speaker andvery, very short. There is little that can’t wait for a landline. If you liveclose to a phone mast and you can move then do so; challenge the placing ofmasts on schools and other buildings, and those located near homes. Challengethe use of Wi-Fi in schools which is bathing children in technologicalelectromagnetism all day and only use the wired Internet whenever you can. Thereis much that can be done and your life and those of your loved ones could welldepend upon it. That is how serious this is.Making it like ‘home’ ...Michael Persinger, a neuroscientist at Laurentian University, said: ‘For thefirst time in our evolutionary history, we have generated an entire secondary,virtual, densely complex environment – an electromagnetic soup – thatessentially overlaps the human nervous system.’ Blake Levitt, author of a longlist of books and articles on the dangers of electromagnetic fields, also putthe situation into perspective in her study entitled The Environmental Effectsof Wireless Technologies and Other Sources of Nonionizing Radiation:> Our background ambient exposures to countless EMFs are increasing at an> alarming rate. This is especially true with the radiofrequency bands. In its> natural state, very little RF reaches the earth’s surface. In the last 50> years, for the first time in our evolutionary history, we have utterly infused> the earth’s surface with a blanket of artificial energy exposures with no> clear understanding of what the consequences may be.> The exposures contain propagation characteristics such as modulation, complex> pulse signalling, unusual waveforms such as sine and sawtooth shapes, and> power intensities that simply do not exist in nature. These are man-made> artefacts.Now we are getting to the meat and potatoes, or the nut roast if you prefer.Firstly the ‘blanket of artificial energy’ around the Earth is the reality‘bubble’ that I have talked about for many years. It is a developing sub-realityof manipulated perception within the overall Matrix of manipulated perception(Fig 771). This additional level of perception deception has been deemednecessary to meet the challenge of the vibrational (information) transformationthat I have called the Truth Vibrations – the awakening of humanity to its trueself and its true plight which is happening all over the world to ever largernumbers of people. The sub-reality is constructed with wireless informationfields and other radiation sources and designed to block or dilute the impact ofthe Truth Vibrations in awakening people to Consciousness beyond Mind-Body. Thestrategy is two-fold: Firstly create the low-vibrational wireless sub-realityand then, secondly, structure society to tune humans to that frequency band bymanipulating their DNA receiver-transmitters through genetically-modified food,chemical additives in food and drink, fear, worry, stress and entrainment totechnologically-generated electromagnetic fields. The idea is to symbolicallyentrain humanity with radio station 1 while the Truth Vibrations are operatingon radio station 2. It is clearly not working with increasing numbers of peopleacross the world as they awaken to a new sense of reality and are at lastbeginning to question their perceptions and see the truth; but so much moreneeds to be done and vast numbers are submitting to the impact of the ‘bubble’.[../Images/00023.jpg]Figure 771: The Archon-created reality bubble and the Truth Vibrations.Fukushima was no ‘accident’There is another reason for the ever-expanding sources of radiation. I have saidthat the Archons are energetic and electromagnetic in nature rather than‘physical’ form, although they can take form in many guises to confuse andmanipulate. Their problem is that their energy fields are not compatible withthe Earth atmosphere and magnetic field and this is one major reason why theycan only come and go and not stay for long. The unspoken element of Agenda 21 isto change the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field to make it more compatiblewith them and on both counts that means mass irradiation. This is also servingthe plan for a mass cull of the human population and they know that a percentagewill mutate to deal with a far more irradiated environment. These are the slavesthat they plan to serve them when the world of Agenda 21 is fully in place.People rightly ask why they would irradiate the atmosphere when their own hybridbloodlines have to live here, too; but (a) the bloodlines are as expendable asanyone else to the Archons, and (b) they are not the same genetically, thus notthe same electromagnetic fields, and so they may well not be affected in thesame way. Look at the longevity of many of them for a start. Two of the waysthat the Archons plan to dramatically increase radiation in the atmosphere isthrough nuclear war and nuclear power disasters. The nuclear power part of theplan has been brought into stark focus by what happened at Fukushima in Japan.Professor Hiroaki Koide, a master of nuclear engineering and a specialist inradiation safety and control, said that at least ten million people are stillliving in areas of high radiation levels that should have been abandoned. Morethan a third of Japanese children had abnormal thyroid growths by the summer of2012 and that is nothing approaching the true impact on human, animal, insectand environmental health. Mutations have already been found in butterflies andother insects which are showing up first because of their short life-cycles. Themassive release of radiation into air, land, sea and water supply began in March2011 and it is still going on hour after hour, day after day. A study in 2012published in Science of the Total Environment reported that the Fukushimaradioactive plume contaminated the entire Northern Hemisphere in a relativelyshort time after the reactor explosions never mind by what has happened since.Fish off the California coast have been discovered with high levels ofcontamination and radiation in air, rain, water and milk have revealed levelshundreds of times greater than normal in US government tests. What has been theresponse by these ‘protectors of the people’? To dramatically raise the official‘safety’ limits. Whenever the authorities give you a ‘safe’ limit for anythingyou can take it as read that it must be dangerous. Nuclear power researcher, thelate Rosalie Bertell, exposed the threat posed by radiation in her book, NoImmediate Danger: Prognosis for a Radioactive Earth. She said: ‘Should thepublic discover the true health cost(s) of nuclear pollution, a cry would risefrom all parts of the world and people would refuse to cooperate passively withtheir own death.’ Bertell also expressed the view that ‘our present path isheaded toward species death – whether fast with nuclear war or technologicaldisaster, or slow, by poison.’ I say that the plan is employ all of thosemethods to a common end. I met a lady in the early 1990s called Dr Kitty Little,an Oxford ‘don’ (a fellow or tutor at Oxford University), who worked for nineyears at the UK’s Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. I mentionedher earlier with regard to British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Lord VictorRothschild. She was very well versed with the inner workings and corruption ofBritish Intelligence and gave me the background to many things. Dr Little toldme all those years ago that the House of Rothschild was behind the introductionof nuclear power and if the Rothschilds are involved it is the global conspiracyat work. All nuclear power stations emit radiation no matter what theauthorities may claim and this has health consequences for those living nearby.The Sellafield (formerly Windscale) nuclear plant in Cumbria, north-westEngland, has been releasing radioactive water into the Irish Sea for decadeswhile protestations from the Irish government and people get nowhere. I detailedin Remember Who You Are the alarming examples and reports revealing how nuclearpower stations, working and offline, are leaking radiation and being allowed todo so by making the law and its enforcement increasingly lax. But, of course, itis when one of these disasters-waiting-to-happen goes tits-up that we see themost significant contribution of nuclear power to irradiating the atmosphere andthere is no better example than Fukushima.I had been logging for years every new contribution that I saw to thetechnologicallygenerated electromagnetic ‘sea’ in which most people now liveespecially in the towns and cities. So when Fukushima exploded in 2011 and beganto release astonishing quantities of ongoing radiation into the atmosphere andocean I had red flags waving immediately. This was surely too much of a gift tothe radiation agenda to have been an accident. I know it was officially causedby an earthquake and tsunami, but HAARP can trigger earthquakes and earthquakesunder the ocean cause tsunamis. Remember how Dimitar Ouzounov and his team atthe NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland revealed there were concentricheat rings above the seabed location of the quake and a rapid heating of theionosphere directly over the epicentre. The team said that infrared emissionsabove the epicentre increased dramatically in the days before it happened.Earthquakes and tsunamis can also be created by carefully placed nucleardevices. It would be unwise and ill-advised to underestimate how much accuracyis now available to these people when it comes to environmental manipulation.Anyone dismissing the idea of placing devices to cause a tsunami should be awarethat military files have revealed that the United States and New Zealand weretesting a ‘tsunami bomb’ off the New Zealand coast in the 1940s. The operationwas code-named Project Seal and came to light when New Zealand author andfilm-maker Ray Waru discovered the files in the national archives. He said thathe only came across them ‘because they were still vetting the report, so thereit was sitting on somebody’s desk’. The UK Daily Telegraph reported that thetests ‘showed that the weapon was feasible and a series of 10 large offshoreblasts could potentially create a 33-foot tsunami capable of inundating a smallcity’. Imagine what they can do today. In fact in the wake of Fukushima do weeven have to imagine? Ray Waru said: ‘If you put it in a James Bond movie itwould be viewed as fantasy but it was a real thing.’ This is an important point.People need to realise that the technology that we are allowed to see is nothinglike the cutting edge technology that is kept hidden from us. This allows theArchon networks to make something happen and keep their involvement secretbecause people believe that the technology is not available to do what has beendone. The James Bond books were written by Ian Fleming, a British NavalIntelligence operative and a serious insider. The official story of Fukushimahas more holes than a Swiss cheese and flooding and earthquake damage cannotexplain what happened. Fukushima Reactor number four exploded when it had beendefueled and shut down. How is that possible? The explosion in Reactor numberthree was caught on video and the smoke cloud looks remarkably like the cloudproduced by a small nuclear bomb (Figs 772 and 773). It just so happens that theFukushima site installed a new security system in the year before the disasterthat involved giant security cameras and sensors known as the Optical WatchLine, or ‘Owl’. Thoughts of Molech (Saturn) are probably not misplaced. Owl isdescribed as a ‘virtual security fence’ for military and civilian use whichincludes an ‘electro-optical radar system’ and ‘stereoscopic vision sensors’.When I say giant security cameras and sensors, I mean giant, and this at a timewhen technology is getting smaller and smaller by the year. The cameras insidethe reactors and around the site weighed more than 1,000 lbs and they hadanother interesting characteristic: they looked inside the casing almost exactlylike what is called a gun-type nuclear weapon (Fig 774). Is it anothercoincidence that the system was installed by Magna BSP, an Israeli securitycompany which is based in Dimona, Israel, the home of Israel’s extensive nuclearweapons production programme? Is it also by chance that all ‘security companies’in Israel are fronts for the Mossad, officially Israel’s Intelligence agency,but in truth a global enforcement arm of the Rothschilds? Or that theRothschilds have an agenda to irradiate the atmosphere? I came across a speechby an American nuclear engineer after I had gone public with my suggestion thatFukushima was not an accident, but a carefully-orchestrated devastating releaseof radioactivity under the cover of the tsunami. His name was Arnie Gundersenand his speech, at the Public Library in Boston, Massachusetts, was to issue awarning about the implications for container design resulting from the events atFukushima. He showed that explosions at Fukushima had produced waves moving atsome 1,000 miles an hour. This is substantially faster than the speed of soundand that should never been able to happen in a genuine nuclear explosion of thetype claimed at Fukushima. Gundersen said that hydrogen and oxygen should onlybe able to produce a subsonic ‘deflagration’ wave, but at Fukushima there hadbeen a beyond-the-speed of sound ‘detonation wave’. This should be impossible.He said:[../Images/00073.jpg]Figure 772: Fukushima Reactor 3.[../Images/00340.jpg]Figure 773: The explosion at Fukushima compared with the cloud produced by asmall nuclear weapon.[../Images/00360.jpg]Figure 774: The ‘security cameras’ in the Fukushima reactors alongside agun-type nuclear weapon.[../Images/00076.jpg]Figure 775: The radiation released by Fukushima has been catastrophic for humanhealth, animal life, sea life and the atmospheric balance in general.> No one knows why this happened.

Maybe the ramifications are that if you want your nuclear plantto remain intact, don’t have your security system installed by a company basedat the location of Israel’s nuclear weapons programme. Soon extraordinaryquantities of radiation had poured from Fukushima into the atmosphere and oceanand by the summer of 2011 figures were being quoted that the release was already50 times worse than that at Chernobyl in the Ukraine in 1986 (Fig 775). Japan isbasically fucked with radioactive contamination of its air, water supply andfood and the incineration of radioactive debris. The Japanese media is in effectbanned from highlighting or discussing the ongoing health effects on theJapanese population and so most of them are ignorant of the dangers andconsequences. High levels of radiation have been found in fish near the plantwith the levels not reducing and a report released in February 2013 byresearchers at Hopkins Marine Station at Stanford University said that bluefintuna caught just off the coast of California tested positive for Fukushimaradiation. The scale of sea and atmospheric radiation is far greater and ongoingthan ever being officially admitted. While this has been happening, the BritishGovernment has announced a tremendous expansion of nuclear power, and emailsleaked to the Guardian revealed how the British Government and nuclear powerinterests including Westinghouse, EDF Energy and Areva were conspiring tomislead the public and diffuse any effective campaign to stop nuclear power. Anofficial at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said of Fukushimain one email:> This has the potential to set the nuclear industry back globally. We need to> ensure the antinuclear chaps and chapesses do not gain ground on this. We need> to occupy the territory and hold it. We really need to show the safety of> nuclear.Notice the ‘We’ as in government and corporations together. This is the ‘We’that directs world events at the expense of the population, but there is noconspiracy to delude the people and impose a system of control upon them. That’sjust a nasty rumour. The radiation agenda goes back decades and now includes thesuicidal process of fracking which is releasing large concentrations of deadlyradioactive radon gas into the atmosphere and also contaminating fracking gasesused by the population for heat and cooking, thus contaminating homes andworkplaces. Radon is the biggest cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. We aregoing to see more nuclear ‘accidents’ for the same reason as the one atFukushima – irradiating the atmosphere. It is my view after 25 years ofresearching these subjects that the ultimate and real reason for nuclear powerstations all over the world with more coming on stream is to be a permanentsystem for the deliberate release of radiation to maintain the planetaryatmosphere in a highlyradioactive state which suits the Archontic entities. Weare a way from that yet, but this is where it is planned to lead and by then avery different and mutated human will be necessary to cope with that. This iswhy they are constantly seeking to make humans more like them and transhumanismis all part of this while the ‘climate change’ Big Lie gives them the excuse topush for nuclear power.More bubble-makingThe European Parliament report on HAARP revealed that nuclear weapons have beenexploded since the 1950s in the areas of charged plasma radiation between 4,800and 32,000 miles above the Earth known as the Van Allen Belts. This wasallegedly to investigate the effect of the electromagnetic pulse generated bynuclear explosions at these heights on radio communications and the operation ofradar. Sure it was. The report said that the effect of these American and Sovietexplosions was to create new magnetic radiation belts which covered nearly thewhole Earth and ‘electrons travelled along magnetic lines of force and createdan artificial Aurora Borealis above the North Pole’. The report continued:> These military tests are liable to disrupt the Van Allen belt for a long> period. The earth’s magnetic field could be disrupted over large areas, which> would obstruct radio communications. According to US scientists it could take> hundreds of years for the Van Allen belt to return to normal.The commencement of human nuclear activity coincided with dramatic rises incases of cancer worldwide. The EU report also pointed out that HAARP waspunching holes in the ionosphere with its radio beams. The ionosphere protectsus from incoming cosmic radiation. ‘The hope is that the holes will fill again’,the report said, ‘but our experience of change in the ozone layer points in theother direction ... This means substantial holes in the ionosphere that protectsus’. Those words were written in 1999 before HAARP was fullyoperational and sowhat must the ionosphere be like today? Dr Rosalie Bertell, an Americanscientist specialising in ionizing radiation, said that HAARP is ‘a giganticheater that can cause major disruptions in the ionosphere, creating not justholes, but long incisions in the protective layer that keeps deadly radiationfrom bombarding the planet’. Physicist Richard Williams, a consultant at theDavid Sarnoff laboratory in Princeton, said that HAARP is ‘an irresponsible actof global vandalism’. Who would be so crazy and cavalier with the atmospherethat sustains us? Anyone who is either insane or wants to change the atmosphere– or both. I have been warning for years about the electromagnetic ‘sea’ ofpollution and distortion within which billions live their lives and deep in theshadows the electromagnetic war on human ‘physical’, mental and emotional healthis very deliberate. The Archon families know full well the effect of what theyare doing because they have set out to ensure precisely that effect as part ofthe assimilation of the human population into the Orwellian nightmare. Many oftheir ignorant foot soldiers who ignorantly serve the Demiurge agenda have noclue what they are doing to the world, themselves and their own children, butignorance is no longer an excuse for criminal irresponsibility because the truthis out there. It is just that most people are looking the other way because theydon’t want to face it. They are going to realise eventually that ignorance isonly ‘bliss’ for a while. Then reality goes rat-a-tat-tat. That time is now andwe have seen nothing yet because of what has already gone before. The Archonsfeed off death and they are now attempting to destroy Planet Earth as we haveknown it and make this world like theirs (Fig 776). It will then not be a placefit for humans but it will be a place fit for them.[../Images/00295.jpg]Figure 776: We will make it like home.The suppression of knowledge about the true nature of reality and the human bodymeans that the clear and obvious link between cause and effect has been hiddenby sheer lack of understanding, not least among most doctors and scientists wholargely do not understand the human organism. They and most of the globalpopulation see the body as flesh and blood, solid and ‘physical’, but this isillusory in the sense that the body is a hologram and only appears to be ‘solid’because of the way we decode waveform and electromagnetic information fieldsinto holographic illusion. As I said earlier, I have shaken my head so manytimes when ‘experts’ have dismissed a connection between people living close topower lines or nuclear power stations and clusters of people with cancers wellbeyond the norm for the general population. Many of these ‘experts’ are justuniformed while others, even worse, are professional liars selling what passesfor their soul for the corporate shilling. Profits for the energy,communication, biotech and pharmaceutical corporations are far more importantfor the system’s programmed personnel than human health and suffering althoughdeeper in the rabbit hole this is about far more than money. The connectionbetween power lines, cell phone communication towers and the devastation ofhuman health is so simple and obvious it is pathetic. The lines and towers giveoff very powerful electromagnetic fields which disrupt and distort the humanelectromagnetic field. This, in turn, passes on the distortion to the bodyhologram because one is an expression of the other. Result: a far greater ratioof people with cancers, often leukaemia, and other ‘physical’, mental andemotional diseases. Blood flowing through arteries and veins is the holographicversion of the meridian lines of energy – what the Chinese and acupuncture call‘chi’ – and so when those flows of energy are damaged by powerfulelectromagnetic fields then so is the blood and leukaemia can follow.I am sure you can see what I mean when I say that because the foundation premisefrom which mainstream science views reality is utter bollocks everything thatflows from that must also reflect this foundation state of bollocks."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00357.jpg]Recruiting the CraziesTo find yourself, think for yourself.SocratesThe Hunger Games world of Agenda 21 clearly requires a Gestapo of uniforms andadministrators deficient of empathy, compassion and intelligence. They areessential to imposing the global tyranny and enforcing it indefinitely once itis in place. If you watch the movie Equilibrium, released in 2002 and availableon DVD, you will see a portrayal of the Agenda 21 society in which emotion isbanned and emotionless, viscous, violent and drugged-up uniforms enforce thewill of the El-lite (Fig 777).Agenda 21 was extremely well portrayed in Equilibrium and this is the societythat Aldous Huxley and George Orwell foresaw (or rather knew was coming fromtheir insider knowledge). It is a world of total control imposed by compulsoryand technologically-monitored drugs and by the 24/7 surveillance of everyaction, gesture and thought. This was once creeping up on us through theTotalitarian Tiptoe and I have been warning about this for nearly 25 years;today it has become the Totalitarian Sprint as the global tyranny crashes in atan ever quickening pace. This is because the more you centralise power the morepower you have at the centre to centralise even quicker. Figures issued by theBureau of Justice Statistics revealed that between 1992 and 2008 police numbersincreased by 25 percent in the United States – faster than the growth of thepopulation – and what will they be today when all the other new forms of ‘lawenforcement’ are taken into account? People are complaining in ever greaternumbers about what Orwell called ‘Big Brother’ as freedoms are deleted by theday, surveillance becomes ever more intrusive and ‘security’ is being used asthe fake excuse to lockdown the so-called free world which is fast closing incollectively on the dark days of Nazi Germany – or today’s China. Obama used thepublicity cover of Hurricane Sandy and its hit on New York in 2012 to quietlysign an Executive Order that created the Homeland Security Partnership Council,an amalgamation of government and private organisations, which will put thepresidential structure (executive dictatorship) power to delete the ‘freedoms’of the American people beyond Congressional oversight (Fig 778). We now havemobile phone app companies adding in the small print that you give thempermission to activate the microphone and camera on your phone to listen to yourconversations and take pictures. As Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.comexplained, you unknowingly give them permission (most people don’t read theterms and conditions) to ‘send SMS messages from your phone that cost you money,read your contacts, read your phone status and identity, get “full networkaccess” to your communications (in other words listen to your phone calls),modify or delete the contents of your USB storage, and disable your screen lock(the 4 digit code that password-protects your phone)’. Extraordinary, but thisis what has been happening while most people have been watching the TV and thefootball and pouring over the latest celebrity bullshit. Why would phonecorporations want to do this if they were not working in league with theOrwellian state? All this was predicted in my books from the early 1990s such asThe Robots’ Rebellion and ... And The Truth Shall Set You Free. The informationin those and other books has not proved to be so accurate by chance; it camefrom ‘following the clues’ in the way I have described which led me to books,articles, documents, people and personal experiences that connected the dots soI could see the picture – the Big (Brother) Picture. Most people laughed,scoffed and dismissed it all for many years but the passage of events has mademany re-think in the light of what they now see on the daily news and experiencein their daily lives. The mainstream media is not among them, of course, apartfrom a few individuals, because alleged ‘journalists’ are among the mostperception-programmed on earth. What must be billions now are feeling seriouslyuneasy with what is happening in the world and where it is going in the face ofwar and economic collapse; but it all looks so complex and bewildering that allmost people can say is that ‘the wars are about oil’ or ‘it’s the greedybankers’. Well, yes it is, but only on one level. It is about far, far more thanthat. Oil and greed are only subsidiary expressions of the Grand Design. Peoplecan’t see what is really going on because of the psychological state describedin Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars:[../Images/00202.jpg]Figure 777: Equilibrium was a portrayal of the world as the Archons want it tobe.[../Images/00149.jpg]Figure 778: Worship me or you die ... my masters said so.> The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that> they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.

Therefore, they do not know how> to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend> themselves against it.What I am doing in this book is dissolving that bind by connecting the dotsbetween apparently unconnected events, people, actions and situations, bothancient and modern. The dots do all connect and the mist suddenly morphs intoclarity and ‘Ahhaaah, so that’s the game’.Thugs for hireTake this Gestapo structure that is so crucial to the implementation of Agenda21. Most people will have surely noticed that the relationship betweengovernment officials and law enforcement and the people they officially serveand protect has dramatically changed in the last 25 years or so. Americancivil-rights attorney John Whitehead of The Rutherford Institute said that apolice friend told him: ‘Something has happened to the police John, the policehave changed.’ Yes, they have, and it has been done systematically. There arestill remnants of the old school police officers, government and councilofficials who do see their role as serving the public that pays their wages; butthese have largely been sifted out and discarded by retirement or by being sosick of what they are told to do that they leave voluntarily. Each time this hashappened the replacement has been selected mostly on the grounds of mentality(or lack of it) and emotional retardation and not on the ability to do the job.Agenda 21 cannot be imposed and enforced by decent people with compassion andempathy and so there has been a calculated campaign to remove them fromgovernment administration and law enforcement and replace them with the‘personality’ of choice for Agenda 21 – the narcissistic, psychopathic, thugsand bully boys and girls without the emotional development to have compassionand respect for their targets and without the intelligence to see that they areonly stooges building a prison for themselves and their own families as well aseveryone else. The Gestapo-like Transportation Security Administration (TSA) inthe United States has some decent people on its security staff because it isharder to find people of Agenda 21 ‘calibre’ than you would think, but there areso many at the TSA who have been specifically recruited for their narcissisticand psychopathic tendencies. Witness the TSA agent who walked through LosAngeles Airport after a shift banging his chest and screaming ‘I have thepower’. He was sacked when the incident was made public in the media, but wouldthe same have happened had it not been so widely reported? I think not. Crimesfor which the TSA ‘security’ employees have been convicted include: stealingitems from passengers’ luggage; drug trafficking; throwing coffee at a pilot whoasked them to stop swearing in front of passengers; pimping; possessing anddistributing child pornography (full-body scans or pat downs for your childrenanyone?); shooting out of a hotel window (a gun, not themselves) while pissed;and bribery. Not all TSA staff are like this by any means. I have met many overthe years who seemed very nice and pleasant, but the majority are recruited fortheir narcissistic character and believe they are above the laws imposed oneveryone else (Fig 779). The narcissists are so self-obsessed and mentallydeficient that they can’t see that they are only stooges of the same system thatthey enforce. They are seen as ‘the cattle’ every bit as much as the generalpopulation. TSA staff operate the full-body scanners that dose people withcumulatively deadly doses of radiation but increasing numbers are suffering fromcancer, strokes and other conditions because the scanners leak and they areabsorbing the radiation during every shift. They have soon realised what thesystem really thinks of them when this is reported and nothing happens. The samestory applies to police and the military which are only vehicles to impose thewill of the El-lite. All this ‘support our wonderful troops’ is justmanipulative crap to cover the fact that the El-lite doesn’t give a damn aboutwho is killed or maimed for life to advance their cause. Their approach is thatthere will always be some other idiot to take their place and the more dismalthe economic circumstances become the more killers and killed can be recruitedas their only way to earn a living. I have used the words narcissists andpsychopaths a time or two already and it is worth defining what I mean by that.I will also add another – sociopath. Psychopaths are defined as having ‘a lackof empathy and remorse and using aggression in a planned way to secure what theywant, whether it is status or money’. Blimey, bankers and politicians exactly.The term ‘narcissist’ comes from the Greek myth about Narcissus who fell in lovewith his own reflection in the water and died because he was so mesmerised thathe couldn’t leave. So you get the basic picture, but this is what the dictionarysays:[../Images/00399.jpg]Figure 779: ‘Yeah, basically our job is to keep the public in line while we dowhatever we fucking like.’> Narcissist: Inordinate fascination with oneself; excessive self-love; vanity.> Erotic gratification derived from admiration of one’s own physical or mental> attributes, being a normal condition at the infantile level of personality> development.> Psychopath: A person afflicted with a personality disorder characterised by a> tendency to commit anti-social and sometimes violent acts, and a failure to> feel guilt for such acts.> Sociopath: A person whose behaviour is anti-social and who lacks a sense of> moral responsibility or social conscience. An obvious self-focus in> interpersonal exchanges.Other traits that were listed in an Internet article that I saw include:> • Problems in sustaining satisfying relationships> • A lack of psychological awareness> • Difficulty with empathy> • Problems distinguishing the self from others (see narcissism and boundaries)> • Hypersensitivity to any insults or imagined insults (see criticism and> narcissists, narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury)> • Vulnerability to shame rather than guilt> • Haughty body language> • Flattery towards people who admire and affirm them (narcissistic supply)> • Detesting those who do not admire them (narcissistic abuse)> • Using other people without considering the cost of doing so> • Pretending to be more important than they really are> • Bragging (subtly but persistently) and exaggerating their achievements> • Claiming to be an ‘expert’ at many things> • Inability to view the world from the perspective of other people> • Denial of remorse and gratitudeI have had people exactly like that in my own life and these are the personalitytypes that have been specifically recruited for government and law enforcementin the last few decades to transform the relationship between people andauthority. One of the most significant traits of narcissists and psychopathswhen it comes to law enforcement is described in the list as ‘hypersensitivityto any insults or imagined insults’ and the term used for this is ‘narcissisticrage’. This can manifest as mild irritation or annoyance, a constant angertowards someone and even violent attacks on the perceived source of thechallenge to their omnipotence. There you have the reason why there are now somany people arrested, Tasered and beaten by police for even politely andpeacefully questioning their omnipotence. The uniforms go into narcissisticrage. Their official role is serving the public, but their real role is servingthe system. Here are two definitions of a psychopath and you’ll notice that, aswith narcissism, they match perfectly the character traits that I have beendescribing throughout this book in relation to the Archons and their bloodlines:> ... an individual who is incapable of feeling guilt, remorse or empathy for> their actions. They are generally cunning, manipulative and know the> difference between right and wrong but dismiss it as applying to them. They> are incapable of normal emotions such as love, generally react without> considering the consequences of their actions and show extreme egocentric and> narcissistic behaviour.> Cold heartedness, egocentricity, superficial charm, manipulativeness,> irresponsibility, impulsivity, criminality, antisocial behaviour, a lack of> remorse, a parasitic lifestyle.A whistle-blower working for the TSA told the Alex Jones radio show in the USthat psychopaths were being specifically recruited for the agency. The man, whoused the name ‘Rob’, said that people who appeared professional and capable ofdoing the job were ignored while those with criminal records, megalomania and‘power-trip behaviour’ were hired. He said: ‘If they have a background and it’ssomething like violence or abusing authority we put them right in, we put themguys on the floor first day.’ He said he was encouraged to recruit Iraq veteranssuffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and prisoners released fornon-violent drug offences. ‘Rob’ said that TSA employees were told to stick outtheir chests and ‘eyeball’ people. ‘It’s all about the power trip, it’s allabout having people bug their eyes out at the public and getting the publicconditioned to the fact that the police state is coming’, he said. TSA agentsalso have a policy of giving more invasive ‘pat downs’ as a punishment to peoplewho refuse the body scanners and also to make it so unpleasant that they will gothrough the scanners in future (Fig 780). Charlie Leocha, consumerrepresentative on the Department of Transport’s Advisory Committee for AviationConsumer Protections, said:[../Images/00220.jpg]Figure 780: ‘I just have to check if you have a bomb in your breasts; well, no,not really, my job is to humiliate you and take away your self-respect.’> When meeting with privacy officials at the Department of Homeland Security and> TSA ... I was told unofficially that there were two standards of pat-downs.> One for the normal situation where passengers are going through metal> detectors and a different pat-down for those who refuse to go through the> whole-body scanners. With this latest announcement, TSA admits that it has> been clandestinely punishing passengers for refusing to go through the> invasive whole-body scans with an even more intrusive aggressive pat-down and> that soon those more invasive pat-down will creep from airport to airport.This is happening as stated. Passengers have also been made to miss flights forhaving a ‘bad attitude’ to the TSA’s outrageous abuse of dignity under the guiseof security. The dilemma facing the Archon hybrids is that there are nothinglike enough of them to impose what they want to do. Their numbers are tinycompared with the human population and to overcome this they have to recruitfrom the target population for their government administrators, police,‘security’ and military. The trick is to recruit the ‘right’ ones and the morecontrol they have secured over the tiller of government the more their mostextreme choices can be hired who would not have got through the door before, orat least in the numbers that we see today. I have observed for 20 years how thedynamic between government and governed, uniform and public, was beingtransformed and I eventually saw how they were doing this. A major technique hasbeen the use of psychometric testing. This phrases questions to glean answersthat reveal your personality type and is used in job application forms toidentify the personalities that the system is looking for. I know from peoplewho have been psychometrically-tested that it can be extremely accurate. Manymore qualified, competent and intelligent people have been consistentlydiscarded in favour of those with the desired personality and in this way thementality of national government, local government and law enforcement has beentransformed. The mind-set has become one of us against them; tellers and told;enforcers and enforced; the system vs the people. Did the Nazis recruit thedecent, caring and honest Germans for their Gestapo or SS? Did the East Germansdo the same with their Stasi? The Shah of Iran with his SAVAK? Stalin with hissecret police? Of course not. And neither today are the police, security staffand military who are being tasked with enslaving the world, ironically includingthemselves and their own families. What use is compassion to a tyranny?Whistleblowers and leaked training films and lectures have confirmed that theserecruits are being programmed to see the public as the enemy and to enforcetyranny without a second thought. I was in New York for three days in 2011 atthe Occupy Wall Street protests to see for myself what was happening (Figs 781).I chatted with one or two of the army of police in military uniforms who werefriendly enough, but most of them were looking for a fight. I met an officiouswoman police officer who was five-foot nothing but acted like she owned theworld and gloried in her perceived power. ‘What I say goes!’ No, what you aretold to say goes. She is just another oil rag keeping the engine of tyranny niceand clean so it can eventually suck up her and her family and blow them out theexhaust pipe. Power? I love it. It is the lack of empathy and compassion whichcomes with narcissism that leads to people being arrested for feeding thehomeless and, as happened in Detroit, a paramedic disciplined for giving ablanket to a crippled man freezing in his underwear after being rescued from ahouse fire. The paramedic gave the man a blanket that had actually been donatedby a charity for that very purpose, but Chief Jerald James at the Detroit FireDepartment said that paramedics should not do this ‘without getting priorapproval from some proper authority’. We have allowed these pea-brains to takesuch a grip of society that their ‘proper authority’ demands to decide when thehungry and homeless can be fed by the open-hearted and when freezing anddistressed old people can be given a blanket. But these computer programs are sodetached from Consciousness that in their microscopic minds they will seenothing wrong with what they do. It’s the rules isn’t it? Well, enough said,then.[../Images/00317.jpg]Figure 781: ‘Now don’t you ever call us thugs again.’Arming the thugsThere have always been power crazy narcissists, psychopaths and sociopaths ingovernment, police and military but we are in a whole new era in terms of scale.It is this dramatic change in the dynamic of enforcer and enforced that has ledto the deluge of reports and YouTube videos of police brutality, arrogance andcorruption, and they have given these people Tasers that unleash 55,000 volts ofelectricity. A Taser in the hand of a psychopath? Good move; or at least goodmove if you want to impose Agenda 21 (Fig 782). The Taser was introduced as aweapon of last resort when officers or the public were considered to be indanger and only to be used by trained firearms officers, but, as I said at thetime, this was just another foot in the door, another Totalitarian Tiptoe, whichwould be extended to the whole of the police. This is now happening withpsychopathic, narcissistic morons and goons opening fire on anyone and everyonewho even dares to question what the brain-dead are ordering them to do (Fig783). Figures released in 2012 revealed that three people are shot by Tasers inBritain every day and they were used in situations a record nearly 4,500 timesin 2011 with spending on the weapon doubled. There are some 12,000 Tasers in useby British police but the authorities and the Police Federation, the police‘trade union’, wants them given to all police officers. This was always theintention. Kenneth Chamberlain Sr, a former US Marine, died in 2011 after heaccidently triggered a medical alert system installed at his home because of hisheart problems. The goonatics then arrived at his door, brain cell at the ready.Chamberlain told them what had happened and assured them that he was fine, butthey then summoned their single-cell neuron activity into one collective networkwith the power to make a toothbrush vibrate for all of 5 seconds. They forcedtheir way into Chamberlain’s home and shot him with the Taser and other‘non-lethal projectiles’. Well, not so non-lethal as it turned out because hehad to be rushed to hospital where he died. The single-cell goonatics hadunleashed 55,000 volts on a man with a serious heart condition. Police inGeorgia were called to deal with a drunk and disorderly incident and found theman in question already lying on the ground, but he was clearly so dangerousthat he had to be Tasered twice. He died moments later. Here is an extraordinaryheadline in the London Daily Mail which is no longer rare with regard to theuniformed idiocy that it reveals: ‘Blind stroke victim shot in the back with50,000-volt Taser by police who mistook his white stick for a Samurai sword’.Don’t ask. Chicago woman Tiffany Rent was Tasered with 55,000 volts ofelectricity by two police goonatics while days away from giving birth forrefusing to pay a parking fine. They must have felt in mortal danger, blesstheir hearts. Rent was then pulled from her car in front of her two children andthe children’s father suffered a dislocated elbow when he tried to intervene. Asuperintendent of the Chicago Police Department (clearly a magnet for idiots)said ‘you can’t always tell whether somebody is pregnant.’ What, at more thaneight months? I do admit that it would appear far easier to spot a moron inuniform in Chicago, but nevertheless, please. Tiffany Rent’s sister asked: ‘Howcould you be that cruel to a human being – a pregnant human being?’ Answer –they are employed to be that cruel; and when they do the job they were hired todo in the way they were hired to it they are protected from prosecution. This iswhy the system covers for so many of them. More than 500 people have officiallydied after being Tasered in the United States alone since 2001, but the truenumber will be much higher. Susan Lee, program director for America at AmnestyInternational, said in a news release:[../Images/00211.jpg]Figure 782: Give a psychopathic thug a Taser – you know it makes sense.[../Images/00115.jpg]Figure 783: The Land of the Free.> Of the hundreds who have died following police use of Tasers in the United> States, dozens and possibly scores of deaths can be traced to unnecessary> force being used. This is unacceptable, and stricter guidelines for their use> are now imperative.But that is not what will happen because it is not meant to happen. If anything,the rules will be made ever more lax in the way they have been since they wereintroduced. People dying from a Taser attack is a good thing from the Archonpoint of view because it makes the public so fear being Tasered that they willdo whatever they are told. I saw a newspaper article at the time of theirintroduction which said ‘I’ll do anything you say officer, just don’t use thatthing on me.’ This is the acquiescence through fear that they are seeking toimpose.Two track lawWe have a police officer in Britain who shot dead Jean Charles de Menezes, aninnocent Brazilian electrician falsely believed to be a terrorist, by firingeight bullets – seven in his head – at point black range while other officersheld him down. Not only did nothing happen to the officers, the one doing theshooting was promoted. Derrick Curtis Saunders, a police officer in Denver, wasfired for driving at 143 miles an hour while drunk on ‘five or six vodkas’. Hepleaded guilty after failing the breathalyser and served five days – that’s days– in jail. How long would a member have the public have got? Then Saunders wasgiven his police job back by the Civil Service Commission which ruled thatdriving at 143 mile an hour while completely pissed was not evidence of ‘willfuland wanton’ or ‘egregious misconduct’. The Commission also indicated that it waswrong to charge him with multiple offences – i.e. driving at 143 miles an hourand being pissed while doing so. Saunders is the same guy who was given only aminor category D reprimand after he pulled his gun on a McDonald’s worker in adrive-thru because his food was taking too long. But the authorities ask ‘What’sthe problem?’ This is just the type of person they want in uniform. Good job manand next time make it Burger King – I don’t like the manager. Another Britishpolice officer, a Mike Baillon, pulled over a 74-year-old for not wearing aseatbelt and then Baillon smashed the vehicle window hitting it 15 times withhis truncheon while his fellow officer jumped on the bonnet and kicked in thewindscreen. This was caught on camera and the incident is on YouTube with theheading ‘Police officer smashing pensioner’s car window with truncheon’. Notonly was Baillon not fired he later won considerable compensation after claimingthat he was forced out of his job by a bullying and harassment campaign bycolleagues at Gwent Police. An investigation by the Better GovernmentAssociation and NBC Chicago revealed that many police officers in suburban partsof the city have union contracts that allow them to work and drive while‘half-drunk’ and in at least two areas they can do this with blood alcohollevels that would see the public jailed. It is not only the bankers that operateto a different system of law, but also those who enforce the law on thepopulation. Simon Harwood, a British police thug, was cleared by a court of themanslaughter of London newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson despite being caught oncamera pushing him violently to the ground for absolutely no reason on to astone pavement. Tomlinson died minutes later. The jury was not allowed to knowthat Harwood had a history of thuggery and his employers, the MetropolitanPolice, even argued that this information should not be made available toTomlinson’s family because it was not relevant to a case in which Harwood wasbeing accused of thuggery. Unbelievable. Thug police pepper-sprayed peacefulprotestors in New York and at the University of California in full view ofcameras and substantial compensation had to be paid to the victims, but nocharges were issued against the yob police involved (Figs 784 and 785). A report(cover-up) by the local California District Attorney’s Office came to thislaughable conclusion:[../Images/00027.jpg]Figure 784: Another moron in uniform.[../Images/00262.jpg]Figure 785: And another ... looks intelligent doesn’t he?> Viewing the incident through the totality of the circumstances, there is> insufficient evidence to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the> use of force involved in the November 18, 2011, pepper spraying was unlawful> and therefore warrants the filing of criminal charges.Pepper-spraying peaceful protestors in full view of everyone leaves us in‘reasonable doubt’? There is a good test for whether we live in a fascist state:are those in authority and enforcement subject to the same laws and consequencesthat they impose on others? Okay, on that basis alone, we live in a state offascism. Anaheim, California, would appear to be a nest for these criminals inuniform. They shot dead an unarmed man posing no danger to anyone and the secondfatal shot to the head happened when he was on the ground after the first shot.Instead of getting medical help they were handcuffing and searching him as hedied. This is such a classic example of the robotic brutality of the headhuntednarcissists, psychopaths and sociopaths. When families and children gathered topeacefully protest at the killing the morons fired rubber bullets, pepper sprayand tear gas and unleashed dogs on women and their children. Local CBS reporterJay Jackson said that ‘at least four’ people told him that officers on the sceneoffered to buy cell phone video footage of what happened. The police then didwhat they always do in these circumstances – lied and lied and lied to demonisetheir victims. Fortunately video footage proved this to be the criminalmendacity that it was, and remember that these are the lying, brutal thugs thatclaim to be upholders of the law. This is planned to be the norm under Agenda21. Aaron Rosas was just 19 when Texas police officers shot him five times inthe dark without warning and then lied beyond belief to cover up what happened.His attorney said: ‘I don’t believe the sheriffs realise that when they engagein this kind of behaviour, they are not just destroying one life, but many ... Idon’t understand how they can lie about this.’ First of all many of them dorealise and don’t give a shit and they lie to save their own arses no matterwhat the consequences for their victims. Aaron Rosas and his mother faced bigmedical bills as a result of this state terror, but all the brain-donor buffoonscare about is getting away with a crime that would mean a long jail sentence foranyone without their ‘badge of [murder-sanctioning] office’. Cold-bloodedkillers in Saginaw County, Michigan – locally known as police officers – shot anunarmed homeless man in a blaze of 46 shots at close range as he was walkingaway from them. The man’s mother rightly called it a firing squad. The localpolice chief defended the action as usual and an apparently never ending‘investigation’ began into what was an open and shut case of murder. I saw thevideo and a man without a gun was walking away from six officers when theysuddenly opened fire, but ‘open and shut’ to the police is to blame the victimfor being in the way when the bullets were fired. Police officers in PimaCounty, Arizona, shot a 26-year-old former Marine 71 times in seven seconds infront of his wife after arriving in an armoured vehicle and bursting into theirhome without identifying themselves as police. Their four-year-old son was alsoin the house. Jose Guerena, who served two tours of duty in Iraq, was hit 60times. He had grabbed a rifle and told his wife and son to hide when the moronsburst in because he thought they were being burgled. He did not fire the weaponand the safety catch was still on when he was killed. The crazies said they werelooking for marihuana, but found nothing. A 61-year-old man, John Adams, wasshot dead by police in Tennessee when they stormed into the wrong house during adrug raid. Apparently a drug informant had given them the wrong address. Oh,just barge in with guns, then, drug informants can never be wrong. Don’t justcheck it out quietly first – send in the Goon Squad and bang, bang, bang, jobdone. Employ crazies and you get crazy. Police in Indiana said that a17-year-old boy in the back of a police car had somehow freed his hands thatwere in handcuffs behind his back and then ‘strangled himself’ with a seat belt.The following is a direct quote from a news report which starkly encapsulateshow the inmates in uniform are taking over the asylum: ‘A Houston police officershot and killed a one-armed, one-legged man in a wheelchair Saturday inside agroup home after police say the double amputee threatened the officer andaggressively waved a metal object that turned out to be a pen.’ Words have nomeaning. The officer’s name was Matthew Jacob Marin, who also shot dead anotherman in 2009 when he refused to put down a knife. Marin would not get even closeto being employed by a genuine police force in service to peace and people, buthis mentality is two-a-penny in this Orwellian world where law enforcement meansa finger on the trigger. It is no coincidence whatsoever that police brutalityand outright murder has increased dramatically since the Israeli-American dualcitizen Michael Chertoff, a director of Homeland Security during the Boy Bushadministration, insisted that US police were ‘trained’ by Israelis in crowdcontrol, counter-terrorism and intelligence gathering. This introduced themilitary policing methods and complete lack of compassion and empathy employedfor decades in Israel by one of the most brutal and murderous police andmilitary operations on Earth. The number of people who die in police custody isabsolutely shocking and that includes the UK.

Anotherastounding example of these moronic hired thugs at work was the case of LeilaTarantino who was pulled over by an officer with the Citrus County Sheriff’sDepartment in Florida for no legitimate reason and the officer goon immediatelypointed his gun at her while her kids looked on. She says she was held for twohours, stripped searched twice on the side of the road in full view of everyoneand even had a tampon forcibly removed. Her children saw all that, too. Fivemale officers and one female were involved and so often today the criminals arewearing the uniforms.Turning the screwPolice brutality throughout the world is exploding and it is all beingorchestrated under Agenda 21. We have children and their parents arrested forselling lemonade or even giving it away for free; people brutally attacked fordancing because it is construed as making a protest – oh my god, not a protest;we have people being shot dead because they were a ‘threat to the police’ whenwitnesses said that their arms were in the air; and Canadian police who raided aprivate home to dig up and seize 1,624 ‘marijuana’ plants in an open back gardenwhich turned to be ... daisies. Yes, daisies. Staff Sergeant Wes Houston toldreporters at the time: ‘This is a significant bust, given the size of thisoperation.’ He spoke while holding garbage bags that he thought were full ofmarihuana, but they were full of, well, daises. He later said that the raid wasordered on ‘the best information we had at the time’. They are a bunch of idiots(Fig 786). Increasingly the lawful right of people to film police operating inpublic is being denied quite illegally so that their behaviour is not recordedto expose them. The corruption is unbelievable because corruption, violence,idiocy and goonatics have a symbiotic relationship. Apple, the ‘we care’ companyestablished by ‘man of the people’ Steve Jobs (who once had high governmentsecurity clearance) has been granted a patent for technology to wirelesslydisable the camera on iPhones and send them into sleep mode in ‘sensitiveareas’. US Patent No. 8,254,902 refers to ‘Apparatus and methods for enforcementof policies upon a wireless device’. Video cameras and phone cameras have beencrucial to exposing police behaviour and their lies and brutality, and theauthorities want to stop this exposure. Los Angeles Police Department became thefirst in America to allow police to arrest people for taking photographs orvideos that are deemed ‘suspicious activity’. Who defines that? They do. A mancalled Sander Roscoe Wolff was confronted by eight police officers for takingshots in his front garden because a courthouse was in the background. LA SheriffLeroy Baca said: ‘While taking pictures in itself is not a crime, in ourheightened state of national security, a courthouse is a Homeland Security hardtarget, and as such, supplemental security precautions are in place.’ How aboutsome supplemental intelligence? Police Chief Jim McDonnell even said thatdetaining photographers for taking pictures ‘with no apparent esthetic value’was within Long Beach Police Department policy. So now the authorities arejudging your arrest or nonarrest based on the aesthetic value of your pictures.Think about the implications of that sentence alone for where we are now. Oneexample of dancing ‘terrorism’ did not even include the inkling of a protest. Itinvolved a couple in their fifties, George Hess and Caroline Stern, who werewaiting for a train in a New York subway station. The fact that New York is oneof the most extreme examples of police brutality and has the toughest laws tostop parents deciding on vaccinations and treatment for their own children, isin no way unconnected to the fact that the city’s long-time mayor until 2013 wasbillionaire insider Michael Bloomberg (Rothschild Zionist). The couple began todance to music from someone playing steel drums, but then the goonatics arrivedto do their duty and protect the public from spontaneous dancers in a virtuallyempty subway station. ‘What are you doing?’ one of them somehow found thevocabulary to ask. ‘We’re dancing’, they replied. ‘You can’t do that on theplatform’, one goonatic said, clearly missing the rather obvious fact that theyalready had been. The Keystone Cops demanded ID and when they could only producea credit card they were ordered to go with the morons in uniform. Mr Hess beganto record what was happening on a camera and a goonatic called for ‘back up’.Some of these new goonatics pulled him to the floor, handcuffed him and chargedhim with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct for ‘impeding the flow oftraffic’ in an almost empty station. The couple were held in custody for 23hours before the ‘charges’ were dropped. Mr Hess, a dentist, is suing the NewYork authorities for what happened, but they don’t really care. After all, it isthe taxpayers that they are brutally targeting who will pay the bills of the NewYork police for the costs of defending their behaviour. You take on the systemand you pay your own bills while the taxpayer foots the bill for the system todefend itself against the taxpayer; if the system comes for you then you payyour own costs and, through taxation, you also contribute to theirs. The scaleof the stitch-up is staggering and all encompassing.[../Images/00310.jpg]Figure 786: ‘Come on, men, there’s a child selling homemade lemonade and peoplefeeding the homeless.’The apparently trivial nature of responding like this to dancing and to kidshaving a lemonade stall in their front garden obscures a much deepersignificance. When I say that they want to control everything under Agenda 21, Imean precisely that ... every last fine detail of our lives, thoughts andperceptions. They want an emotionless, joyless population of robotic slaves asportrayed in the movie Equilibrium and Orwell’s 1984 (Fig 787). This does notallow dancing, laughing or spontaneous expressions of joy or spontaneousexpressions of anything. ‘Spontaneous’ is one of countless words that will bedeleted from the dictionary and verbal usage because it means: ‘Happening orarising without apparent external cause; selfgenerated; arising from a naturalinclination or impulse and not from external incitement or constraint;unconstrained and unstudied in manner or behaviour.’ Unconstrained is anotherword destined for the dustbin if we allow this to continue. The Archon mind doesnot understand ‘spontaneous’, except in the sense that they know it is dangerousfor their plan if humanity was unconstrained enough for spontaneity to flourish.Archons have no capacity to express spontaneity because they lack a creativeimagination or ‘intentionality’. Everything has to be meticulously planned andstructured. They cannot even comprehend spontaneity, but they are aware enoughof its potential to fear it. This is why spontaneity is being targeted fromevery angle including by goons on empty station platforms. Parents in Virginiahave been harassed by social workers and police for allowing their children toplay outside alone in a safe area at 4pm in the afternoon. They were playing ina field next to their home where they could be seen from the kitchen window andtwo of them were teenagers. Police talked to the children and then wrote areport about the children being allowed to play outside unsupervised. The motherwas also told by her neighbours that it wasn’t safe to play out anymore. LenoreSkenazy of the organisation Free-Range Kids says that she is constantly beingcontacted by parents harassed by police for allowing their children to playoutside. She said:[../Images/00426.jpg]Figure 787: ‘Ain’t it just great to be free?> What’s happening ... is parents who let their children play outside, walk to> school, or go to the grocery [store] for them often have neighbors who turn> them in, supposedly out of concern ... and what happens is Child Protective> Services [CPS] is obligated to come and check out whether or not these parents> are being negligent, or worse abusive.> What has happened is that the parents are found wrong by the police or CPS for> leaving their children in what CPS calls ‘a dangerous situation’, which I> would call a ‘normal, nice situation’. In fact, less dangerous than just> letting your kids sit inside all day getting fat and diabetic, you let your> kids run outside or have some independent adventures, that’s considered bad> parenting now.[../Images/00312.jpg]Figure 788: ‘Take them home, arrest their parents for neglect and give thesekids a computer game.’This is how far the social engineering has gone and if you want to read some ofthe craziest political correctness in relation to children, seefreerangekids.com. The American Academy of Pediatrics has even said that doctorsshould ‘actively discourage recreational trampoline use’ in case children suffer‘sprains, strains and contusions’ as the American Academy of Pediatrics hasclearly already suffered due to multiple blows to the head. It is called growingup you idiots and learning about the world, but that is not what the systemwants (Fig 788). The constant deluge of ‘new laws and regulations is designed tosuppress spontaneity (the free flow of human energy in its creative power) bylegislating for all human behaviour and dictating what can and cannot be done,and where, when and how it can be done – or not. The content of this book wouldbe lost on the station platform goonatics before the turn of the first page. Itwould be in another planetary system to their capacity to grasp the magnitude ofits implications, but then that is the very mentality the system is looking for.They want their uniforms to be arrogant, ignorant and mindless with no abilityto see what they are doing in terms even of the world that they and theirfamilies will have to live in. Children are being prepared to accept theOrwellian nightmare as ‘how things are’ by surveillance cameras in schools,electronic passes and finger-print scanning to take out library books or getschool meals. So many schools are now surrounded by fences that make many looklike prisons and this is appropriate given what is happening. In places such asLauderdale County, Mississippi, kids are being carted off to jail for dress code‘violations’ and ‘talking back’. Oh, you mustn’t ‘talk back’ only follow ordersfrom the academic Gestapo to prepare you for doing the same for the rest of yourlife. An investigation by the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Divisionfound that the county operates a brutal ‘school-to-prison pipeline,’ and saidthat the system ‘shocks the conscience’. The report revealed that students mostaffected by this situation are African-American children and children withdisabilities. The people and police behind this treatment of children are onceagain mentally deranged because balanced minds would not even consider suchbehaviour. Children and students at the John Jay High School and Anson JonesMiddle School in San Antonio, Texas are being told to wear microchipped trackingtags so the school can know where they are at all times. The official story saysthat this is being done for the safety of the students and to improveattendance. Maybe more kids would want to go to the schools if they were not runby idiots like these. School officials have treated protesting parents withcontempt and this is increasingly happening as the State seizes more and morecontrol over children and marginalises parents. Dr Richard Day said in 1969:‘Schools will become the hub of the community’. Put another way, schools wouldtake control of children from parents which is happening more all the time.Students that refuse to wear the Texas tracking chips are reported to be deniedaccess to some school functions as well as common areas like the cafeteria andlibrary. John Jay student Andrea Hernandez said that staff told her that shecan’t participate in school elections if she doesn’t comply with the trackingprogram (this is the plan for the population in general). These people areteaching children? They should be seeking psychiatric help. DeputySuperintendent Ray Galindo told Andrea’s parents:> We are simply asking your daughter to wear an ID badge as every other student> and adult on the Jay campus is asked to do ... I urge you to accept this> solution so that your child’s instructional program will not be affected. As> we discussed, there will be consequences for refusal to wear an ID card as we> begin to move forward with full implementation.This is precisely the sequence of events planned for the entire population –voluntary microchipping (as now) to compulsory microchipping or not be allowedaccess to anything. Mr Galindo urges parents to ‘accept this solution’ (do whatwe say = solution), while I urge Mr Galindo and his colleagues to either makethe decision to move forward beyond puberty and become a mature adult or find ajob that doesn’t involve either children and young people or the suppression ofbasic human freedoms on behalf of the state. The world would surely be a betterplace. What can you say about the scale of stupidity behind the school systemwhen the parents of a three-year-old deaf boy called Hunter Spanjer were told bytruly brainless officials of the Grand Island, Nebraska school district that hewould have to change the hand sign used for his name because it looked too muchlike a gun? The school officials look too much like complete idiots, so can wechange them as well? Seven-year-old Josh Welch was suspended by Park ElementarySchool in Baltimore for biting a pastry until it ‘looked like a gun’. Josh said:‘It was already a rectangle, and I just kept on biting it and biting it and toreoff the top and it kinda looked like a gun, but it wasn’t.’ He said that he wastrying to shape it into a mountain, but the teacher said it was a gun and was‘pretty mad’. Well, ain’t that the truth. The elementary minds at ParkElementary suspended Josh for two days and sent a letter to parents to say that‘one of our students used food to make an inappropriate gesture’. Josh’s fathersaid after the school contacted him that he would ‘almost call it insanity’. Oh,go ahead because that’s what it is. A school assistant principal even wrote toparents offering counselling to children who may have been upset by theincident: ‘... If your children express that they are troubled by today’sincident ... our school counsellor is available to meet with any students whohave the need to do so ...’ Counselling for children upset by their little matebiting a strawberry tart into a particular shape? These people are mentally illand they are ‘teaching’ children. What did the parents of these kids do aboutthis lunacy? Nothing.The idea is to prepare young people from the earliest age possible to acceptthat microchipping and total control and surveillance is perfectly natural andit’s happened everywhere. If you think it’s bad now, it’s nowhere near wherethey want it to go. Schools already have surveillance cameras and police on thepremises and now microchipped tracking tags. It’s a school. What a society thesechildren – all children – are going to have to live in, or die in, if parentsthe world over don’t detach their fingers from their arses."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00405.jpg]The Orwellian Global StateThe Divine Light is always in man, presenting itself to the senses and to thecomprehension, but man rejects it.Giordano BrunoLaws that prevent the military being used in domestic law enforcement are beingovercome by turning the police into the military. They now wear similar uniformsand protection gear and they are increasingly using the same weapons (Fig 789).I am old enough to remember when British police did not have guns and yet now itis almost commonplace. In terms of Tasers, it is.This is the Totalitarian Tiptoe to a combined world police and military forcethat is planned to impose the will of a world government and Agenda 21. ThePentagon 1033 program is transferring military hardware and weapons worthhundreds of millions of dollars every year for use by the police in domestic lawenforcement. The figure of $212 million in 2010 doubled to $500 million in 2011and orders increased by another 400 percent in 2012, according to data providedby the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency to the Internet news site, The Daily.The transfers include grenade launchers, M-16 assault rifles, armoured vehiclesand tanks, helicopters and military robots (Figs 790 and 791). The officialcover story is that this is necessary to help police ‘fight drugs and terrorism’(both of which are controlled by the very networks that are arranging for thetransfer of military equipment to the police – Problem-Reaction-Solution). Thisis nothing whatsoever to do with drugs or terrorism and everything to do withbuilding a centrally-commanded, centrally-armed military and policeinfrastructure to enforce total human enslavement under Agenda 21. The transferof military armoury to the police has been happening for decades, but it is nowgoing into overdrive. The Daily reported that more than 17,000 civilian agencieshave received military equipment worth billions so far and they often pay onlyfor the cost of delivery. Civilian law enforcement is being equipped withmilitary technology by using the absolutely colossal military ‘defence’ (attack)budget to build a civilian military operation called the police, SWAT teams,FBI, TSA, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms (ATF), Food and Drug Administration, Environmental ProtectionAgency and a long list of others. Obama said during his mendacious electioncampaign in 2008:[../Images/00323.jpg]Figure 789: The military police.[../Images/00358.jpg]Figure 790: Traffic patrol.[../Images/00352.jpg]Figure 791: Tampa police working under cover.> We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national> security objectives we’ve set. We’ve got to have a civilian national security> force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.The fraud knew exactly what he was talking about – the control system of Agenda21 – and we are now so clearly seeing it unfold. Obama groupies MSNBC posted anarticle in effect justifying the deployment to police forces of ‘a 10-officer16,000-pound armoured tank that takes bullets like Superman and drives 80 mph’.This ‘BearCat G3’ is alleged to be needed to protect the police and MSNBCreported that ‘the federal government buys dozens each year for local policedepartments’ (Fig 792). The fascist Gestapo known as ‘SWAT teams’ (people arejust flies) are the major recipients of this military equipment it would seem,with their shocking record of targeting the wrong houses and killing innocentpeople including children. These are the El-lite of goonatics and their armedraids on homes and businesses are absolutely soaring every year. And, hey, greatnews from MSNBC – ‘Thanks to the US government, most police departments now gettheir BearCats free’. Wow, great stuff. Have they ever thought of asking thereal reason why that is? Ooops, sorry. How silly of me. Lou Vallejo, sheriff ofGarfield County, Colorado, said: ‘In the world of law enforcement, we must alsobe prepared for the highly unlikely, but possible tragic event ... and there isno price tag you can put on the life of a police officer who is out thereprotecting you.’ And ‘how can you argue with that?’ the MSNBC article said.Well, I’ll give it a go for a start. This is not about protecting policeofficers who are seen as fodder by the system like everyone else. The game ismass human enslavement. This military weaponry including tanks is being giveneven to small county police forces in line with the local enforcement plans ofAgenda 21 which I have described. Local city, town and county authorities arebecoming tyrannies already, but the plan is to integrate them with the police,military and other government agencies into a seamless system of total controlright down to every local street. This is another Agenda 21 buzz-word:integration. I am waiting to hear the term ‘smart integration’ and then we’llhave the set. Police budgets are being run down in an attempt to force them intousing methods that they would not normally employ if they had the man power.Bill Partridge, chief of police in Oxford, Alabama, said that his use of the1033 program was to ‘save money, bottom line’. He said that his department doesa weekly or daily check to see what is available from the military. ‘If you’requick on the trigger on the Internet, usually you can get what you want’, hesaid. The British Ministry of Defence announced in 2012 that contracts are beingsigned for 30,000 assault rifles of the kind used by troops that can be deployedfor use by civilian police officers. Why? Er, to fight terrorists and criminalgangs. Bloody liars. Why is the Ministry of Defence with responsibility for themilitary getting involved with the domestic police force? The answer is obvious(Fig 793 and 794). Police budgets in Britain are also being squeezed because theplan is to force them to employ private security corporations like the ludicrousG4S with a view to them taking over all policing. This is already happening anddespite the G4S ‘security’ fiasco at the London Olympics the Scottish Governmentawarded the company a five-year, £13 million contract to use satellitetechnology to track criminals wearing ankle and wrist tags. The plan is also tohand government administration to private corporations.[../Images/00128.jpg]Figure 792: TWAT team vehicle. My goodness, my spelling is terrible.[../Images/00246.jpg]Figure 793: ‘So where did she say she last saw her cat?’[../Images/00017.jpg]Figure 794: Big guns compensating for their dicks.[../Images/00134.jpg]Figure 795: ‘Here’s looking at you kid ... and everyone else.’Eyes (and guns) in the skyIf people think that local police in tanks is overthe-top well try unmannedarmed drones patrolling the skies of America (and the rest of the worldeventually) with the technology that can see through the walls of your home (Fig795). DARPA, the Pentagon’s Archontic research and development agency, hasannounced the introduction of the world’s most powerful surveillance technologyso far with 1.8 gigapixels that can pick out details as small as six inches froma height of 20,000 feet and observe an area at any one time of ten square milesor 25 square kilometres. It is called ARGUS-IS or Wide Area Persistent Stare.Two drones equipped with ARGUS could maintain surveillance 24 hours a day on anarea as big as Manhattan. The US Government has announced that drone patrols areto begin in the sky over America and the latest Totalitarian Tiptoe is to armmany with rubber bullets and tear gas on the road to the military mass-killtechnology that is exterminating streams of innocent people in countries likeAfghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, the list just goes on expanding. Privatedefence (attack) contractors are spending millions to bribe Congress intoopening up airspace for drone flights. Documents released under the Freedom ofInformation Act confirmed that drones are to be used for the mass surveillanceof American people and this will add to the dangers faced by other aircraft inthe crowded skies of North America. Many drones have also crashed around theworld. The Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act waspassed on Capitol Hill in 2012 which authorises the deployment of 30,000 spydrones over the US. Police departments said in the documents that the drones cancarry infrared and zoomcameras for low light ‘dusk-dawn’ video. Some dronecameras can ‘recognize and track individuals based on attributes such as height,age, gender and skin color’. Government documents obtained by the ElectronicPrivacy Information Center revealed that the Predator B drone fleet have beenfitted with technology to track cell phone signals and identify people carryingguns legally and illegally. None of this is about ‘fighting terrorism’ butrather about enslaving the population. The first known arrest resulting fromdrone surveillance was a North Dakota farmer accused of not returning six cowsthat wandered onto his land. The Environmental Protection (farmer and growerdestroyer) Agency (EPA) is using drones to spy on farmers and when challenged aspokesman said: ‘Courts, including the Supreme Court [all Archon-controlled],have found similar types of flights to be legal (for example to take aerialphotographs of a chemical manufacturing facility) and EPA would use such flightsin appropriate instances to protect people and the environment from violationsof the Clean Water Act.’ People need urgently protecting from the violation andabomination that is the EPA.Brookings Institution senior fellow Peter Singer said that drones are not onlypicking up specific information at a scene, but the scene in general. ‘Basicallyit’s recording footage from a lot of different people that it didn’t have theirapproval to record footage’, he said. The California city of Lancaster, underMayor Rex Parris, got into the spirit with a Cessna plane flying to and fro witha camera constantly delivering pictures to the ground and able to zoom-in onanyone walking in the street from three miles away. Lancaster claims that it isstruggling for money yet spends $1.3 million a year on this. Money is never anobject when it comes to the Archon agenda. The Federal Aviation Administrationestimates that the 30,000 drones of all sizes will be flying over America by2032 operated by law enforcement, military, corporations and public ‘safety’agencies. Think about that. Relate the number of terrorist attacks that are notstaged (which leaves next to none) against the alleged need to have 30,000surveillance and kill drones in the skies over America along with the alreadyfantastic array of security checkpoints, data collection and cameras. It makesno sense whatsoever unless you can see – and my god is it really difficultanymore – that this is a network designed for mass human subjugation. The‘terrorists’ and criminals are not the target. Those in the gunsights are thegeneral population. There is even drone technology in development at theUniversity of Pennsylvania with the potential to snatch humans off the streetfrom the air as an eagle swoops for a fish. There are already more than 60 dronecommand centres in America with more to follow and a report by the CongressionalResearch Service warned that drones could end privacy in the United States. Youdon’t say. Britain has spent £2 billion buying and developing drones in the lastfive years and British military personnel have been involved in guiding US dronestrikes in Afghanistan and elsewhere with an American drone operation being setup at the RAF Waddington airbase in Lincolnshire to coordinate drone attacks inthe Middle East and Africa. The US-operated RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire isalso involved. Britain’s here-today-gone-tomorrow ‘police minister’, DamienGreen, said that flying drones in British skies that can spy on the populationshould be treated like ‘any other piece of police kit’. What an idiot. ChrisCole, the founder of the Drone Wars UK campaign, said: ‘At a time of toughspending cuts, it cannot be right that the UK is pouring billions of pounds intodeveloping new drones without proper parliamentary scrutiny or debate of theserious legal and ethical issues surrounding the use of this technology.’ It’snot right, mate, but it is the Archontic agenda and so cost is never an issue.The US Navy is now also developing submarine drones and in the pipeline aredrones that can make their own decisions on where to go and how to respond. I amnot kidding. Mark Maybury, chief scientist for the US Air Force, said of futuredrones: ‘Before they were blind, deaf and dumb – now we’re beginning to makethem see, hear and sense.’ If only they could do the same for people likeMaybury. Drones are even being promoted to the public as good for jobs and theeconomy – anything to hide the reason for their very existence which is humancontrol.Drone surveillance does not only take the form of large aircraft. Someweaponcarrying drones in development for the US military weigh five pounds orless. British police have introduced radio-controlled flying surveillancecameras, and the Pentagon has admitted that it has developed bug-sizedsurveillance technology known as the ‘microaviary’. This is surveillance andassassination technology disguised as flying insects or birds (Figs 796 and797). People have already reported seeing robotic-like dragonflies at politicalevents in Washington and New York, including anti-war rallies. Washington lawyerBernard Crane said: ‘I’d never seen anything like it in my life. They were largefor dragonflies. I thought, “Is that mechanical, or is that alive?”’ These madpeople are even adding microchips to live flying insects. I mean, where are thewhite coats when you need them? Catherine Crump, staff attorney for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union (ACLU), said that it was ‘simply not appropriate to useany force, lethal or non-lethal, on a drone’ because an officer controlling adrone from an Air Force base would not have the same perspective of a situationas a police officer on the ground. But, Catherine, they don’t give a shit.People are just apples in a barrel to them. Crump added that ‘the prospect ofpeople out in public being Tasered or targeted by force by flying drones whereno officer is physically present on the scene raises the prospect ofunconstitutional force being used on individuals’. The prospect? The AmericanConstitution was torched decades ago. Where have you been? One of the problemsis that so-called ‘civil liberties’ organisations are so uninformed about whatis happening and so irrelevant in their response. Liberty, the ‘civil rights’organisation in Britain headed by former government barrister Shami Chakrabarti,is a typical example (see Human Race Get off Your Knees). They are a waste ofspace and just another arm of the Establishment but these are the people thatthe mainstream media go running to for a quote on any freedom-related issue.They’re nice and safe, see. Crime is being ignored and encouraged as aProblem-Reaction-Solution to justify ever more intrusive and fascist policing.This is why so many crimes are not even investigated, never mind solved.Reducing budgets is designed to ensure that this policy increases and so is theconstant centralisation of police operations. Dr Richard Day in 1968: ‘Crimewill be used to manage society.’ Some current and former police chiefs andofficers can see the nonsense that is going on from a purely policing point ofview, but they are lone voices. Joseph McNamara, the former chief of police inKansas City, said that the militarisation of the police was counterproductive:[../Images/00147.jpg]Figure 796: Gives ‘being bugged’ a new meaning.[../Images/00099.jpg]Figure 797: Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s the super-prats.> It’s totally contrary to what we think is good policing, which is community> policing.

This includesexcruciatingly painful sound technology to disperse peaceful demonstrations andin 2012 the US National Guard bought half a million dollars’ worth of theseportable ‘LRAD acoustic systems’ for use throughout America in preparation forwhat they know is quickly approaching in terms of public response when acritical mass of people realise what is really happening and why.Disarming the enemy – the peopleAt the same time that these multi-levelled domestic police-military forces arebeing installed with high-tech weaponry the campaign to disarm the globalpopulation is being pursued like never before. It is clearly far easier toimpose a global military fascist/communist dictatorship when your targetpopulation is unarmed and this is what the ‘gun control’ frenzy is all about.They seek to justify this by stopping mass shootings and ‘preventing violentcrime’ when gunmen and criminals can get firearms whenever they want no matterwhat laws are in place. Britain has strict laws on gun ownership, but thatdoesn’t stop criminals getting them and mostly from gun supply networks thatinvariably connect with the Archon families. The experience of history showsthat the confiscation of weapons from the general population is the precursor tomass murder and control by the state. We have seen this in Nazi Germany, theSoviet Union, China, Uganda, Cambodia, Rwanda and elsewhere (Fig 798). It is anextraordinary fact that in the 20th century governments killed four times morecivilians than the combined total of those killed in all international anddomestic wars combined. Criminals and terrorists are as nothing compared withthe governments of the Archon network when you consider that an estimated 170million civilians were killed by governments in 20th century. The Nazis bannedJews in 1938 from ‘acquiring, possessing, and carrying firearms and ammunition,as well as truncheons or stabbing weapons’. What invariably follows such guncontrols can be seen in Figure 799. Today Rothschild Zionists want to disarmAmericans in the same way and the question will be asked why this is so afterthe Jews’ experience with the Nazis. The answer is very simple: there are Jewsand there are Rothschild Zionists and they are not necessarily the same thing.The Soviet and Chinese tyrannies did the same to their peoples before embarkingupon mass slaughter. Illegal gun ownership under Rothschild-puppet Stalincarried the death sentence and the population was at the mercy of a man who didnot even acknowledge the word’s existence. Tens of millions were murdered orstarved to death. Tyrants always seek to disarm the target population beforethey move in for their final takeover and today they are talking about disarmingthe world population in preparation for a global takeover. The United Nations(through which Agenda 21 is being coordinated) passed a global gun treaty in2013 to hand governments the control of all weapons. The Archon bloodlines ownthe UN and the arms trade through their ‘defence’ corporations and so this wasclearly not targeting them and it is instead an excuse to seize weapons from thegeneral population in readiness for the global takeover through binding worldregulations for small arms and conventional weapons. You see once again –binding world regulations or international law. These regulations are as alwaysworded in ways that allow almost limitless interpretation once passed into law.This has happened with ‘anti-terrorist’ laws which have been applied to thedomestic population without any connection to terrorism. The Second Amendment ofthe US Constitution gives citizens the right to bear arms, but that is of nointerest to these criminals. A series of Rothschild Zionists including LouisMichael Seidman, a leading voice in the Rothschild-created B’nai B’rith andprofessor of constitutional law at Georgetown University, are now calling forthe US Constitution to be scrapped. Tyranny cannot be imposed if theConstitution is adhered to. The plan was laid out in a briefing by the US StateDepartment in 1961 which detailed a Program for General and Complete Disarmamentin a Peaceful World that would be enforced by the United Nations. The UN would‘enforce the peace as the disarmament process proceeds’. The document didn’tactually envisage ‘a general and complete disarmament’ at all, because whileeveryone else would be banned from having weapons the ruling authorities wouldget to keep theirs:[../Images/00192.jpg]Figure 798: Gun control supporters.[../Images/00281.jpg]Figure 799: History’s perpetual lesson.> The manufacture of armaments would be prohibited except for those of agreed> types and quantities to be used by the UN Peace Force [inversion] and those> required to maintain internal order. All other armaments would be destroyed or> converted to peaceful purposes.This is once again Agenda 21. The 1961 document talks about destroying nationalsovereignty, dismantling national armies and global control being transferred tothe UN (world government) ruling through its enforcement agency, a world army.But there is no need to be concerned. There is no conspiracy. I read itsomewhere. One US administration after another through Reagan-Bush, Clinton, BoyBush and Obama have pressed for tighter gun laws to stop violence while theyhave been ordering the massbombing of civilians in country after country.Obama’s first-term Secretary of State, the satanic Hillary Clinton, said: ‘Wewill try as hard as we can to keep guns away from people who shouldn’t havethem.’ Well, that’s her for a start, then. Tony Blair used the excuse of theengineered mass killing of children at the school in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996to justify tighter gun laws in Britain when the killer, Thomas Hamilton, was asupplier of children for sex to the El-lite in Scotland, a world centre forEl-lite Satanism and paedophilia. They don’t call the biggest secret society onearth in terms of numbers the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for nothing. Oneofficial justification for gun bans in the United States is that illegal gunsare being exported over the border into Mexico to be used by drug gangs andcrime in states like Arizona, California and New Mexico. Government agenciesconspired to make this appear to be justified by supplying the Mexican gangswith arms through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in a projectknown as Project Gunrunner which included Operation Fast and Furious. There wasalso an earlier operation code named Operation Wide Receiver. Obama AttorneyGeneral Eric Holder was heavily involved in this covert gun-supply and he oncesaid: ‘We need to brainwash people to think about guns in a vastly differentway.’ Hillary Clinton has also been connected to all this by independentinvestigative journalists. Deputy Assistant ATF Director William McMahon, whooversaw the agency’s region involved in Fast and Furious, was exposed for doingthat job – or not – while also being paid a full-time salary as executivedirector of global security and investigations for JP Morgan in the Philippines.A major bank and the government employing the same guy? I can’t believe it,surely some mistake. Those at the top of the Fast and Furious food chain – Obamaand Attorney General Holder – were protected by the system while the lower rankstook the rap for it in a report by the Justice (inversion) Department’sinspector general Michael Horowitz who pinned the blame on the failure oflower-level officials to tell Holder what was going on. Why would they when theyknew that he knew? Order some more whitewash please, we’re almost out. Whathappened in Fast and Furious/Gunrunner only became known thanks to ATFwhistleblowers who supplied CBS with documents to prove that the ATF secretlyencouraged guns sales to suspected drug traffickers in an effort to justify newgun laws. Thousands of weapons were circulated to be used in violent crime inMexico and the United States in places like Phoenix, Arizona. The response tothese revelations was for ATF acting director Todd Jones to warn all staff thatthere would be consequences if it happened again. No, not the distribution ofAmerican weapons to Mexican drug gangs. That was fine until someone spoiled itby spilling the beans. The threat of consequences by Jones was aimed at anyoneelse who thought it was their public duty to reveal the ATF’s illegal activitieswithout asking him for permission first. The ludicrous Jones told ATF staff:‘Choices and consequences means simply that if you make poor choices, that ifyou don’t abide by the rules, that if you don’t respect the chain of command, ifyou don’t find the appropriate way to raise your concerns to your leadership,there will be consequences.’ A ‘poor choice’ in ‘free America’ is telling thetruth about the way your own government is arming drug gangs to justifydisarming the American population. This is why people like Todd Jones andsimilar characters are appointed to public office. Honest people need not apply.I mean, the guy was a US attorney for the District of Minnesota. Terrifying. Hiswarning to ATF employees was just one example of the vicious and vindictive warthat the Obama administration has waged against whistleblowers exposinggovernment corruption, and Obama’s spinners even used this fact to promote himfor a second term. One campaign document said: ‘The Obama administration hasprosecuted twice as many cases under the Espionage Act as all otheradministrations combined.’ When Obama was first trying to get elected in 2008 hedescribed whistle-blowing as ‘acts of courage and patriotism’ that should beencouraged rather than stifled as they had been during the Bush administration.Four years later one writer accurately observed: ‘President Obama ... has wagedthe most aggressive and vindictive assault on whistle-blowers of any presidentin American history, as even political magazines generally supportive of himhave recognized and condemned.’Staged mass murderI don’t have guns; I don’t want guns; I can’t remember ever shooting a gunexcept to win a coconut at the fair; there is nothing about guns that I like andI wish we had a world without them. To say the least I am not your typicalopponent of new gun legislation in America. I don’t quote the US Constitution insupport of what I say and have no desire to open carry, concealed carry or carryat all. BUT. If we are going to be mature and streetwise about current eventsthe most relevant question that needs to be asked is not about guns or no guns,gun laws or no guns laws, but this: why do those who control the Americangovernment want to disarm Americans now of the very weapons that would be in anyway effective in resisting a military coup by the fascist-controlled Americangovernment? And another: why at the same time that this is happening is militaryweaponry and technology, including tanks, being transferred in vast quantitiesby the Pentagon from the military to the American police? And two others: whyhas Homeland Security bought two billion rounds of ammunition (and rising) alongwith 7,000 fully-automatic assault rifles and 2,717 ‘Navistar Defense’ armouredvehicles all to be used within the United States, and why are there hundreds ofthousands of plastic coffins stored at locations around the country? See Figure800. All this in the very period that the hysteria has been engineered andgenerated to remove from Americans weapons with any chance of resisting apolice/military takeover by their own government which has long been planned anddetailed in my books. Answer those questions (and they all have the same answer)and you will be home and dry in terms of understanding what we are looking athere. I and others have been warning about this for a long time and it is theunfolding of a plan going back many decades (and centuries for the inner circle)to disarm Americans and then unleash the crazies in uniform on a helplesspopulation. The Problem-Reaction-Solution scenarios of mass shootings followedby demands for new gun laws has a considerable history and to anyone with a mindof their own a blatantly obvious goal – to disarm America (Fig 801). The namesare etched in the psyche of Americans and the wider world ... Columbine,Virginia Tech, Aurora, Wisconsin, Sandy Hook ... and more. They all follow afamiliar pattern of mostly young people embarking on mass killing sprees inplaces where the public would normally feel safe – schools, a university, achurch and a movie theatre. The idea is to implant a feeling of ‘this couldhappen to me’, or ‘this could happen to my kids’. The mind manipulation demandsthat people do not feel safe and the best way to achieve this is by targetinglocations where they normally would – so increasing the belief in ‘this couldhappen to me’ and ‘nowhere is safe anymore.’ The whole game is the manipulationof fear. Schools are the main target to play on the natural empathy that peoplehave with children and the relationship that parents have with their ownchildren. How many parents across America took their kids to school in the daysafter Sandy Hook with a knot in their stomach and a fear that the same couldhappen to them? People need to understand that the conspiracy is about themanipulation of perception because everything comes from that. What we believewe perceive and what we perceive we experience even if what we believe is nottrue which most of the time it isn’t. The brain is receiving something likeeleven million ‘impressions’ of reality every second and yet constructs what wethink we are seeing from just 40 of them. The aim of the conspiracy is tomanipulate human perception processes so that we decode and bring into apparentreality the 40 impressions a second that draw us into the trap. The shooting atthe movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, is great example of how these covert‘grab-their-guns’ mass shooting operations follow a clearly identifiableblueprint that the mainstream media refuse in their ignorance (mostly) andconscious connivance (the few) to highlight and expose. The common themes ofpsychiatry/psychology/mind control; the military; drugs; official stories thatmake no sense and contradict the accounts of witnesses; inexplicablecoincidences; and Satanic and occult ritual were there in abundance again inColorado on the opening night of the Batman movie Dark Knight Rises on July 20th2012. Twelve people died and 58 were wounded that night when a man dressed inblack and wearing a gas mask came in through an emergency exit that could onlybe opened from the inside, threw a tear gas canister and opened fire.[../Images/00094.jpg]Figure 800: So what are these for?[../Images/00086.jpg]Figure 801: Why they stage mass shootings.The mind-controlled assassinThe alleged ‘Batman’ killer, 24-year-old James Holmes, was a neuroscience PhDstudent at Colorado University who had a fascination with altered states ofconsciousness (Fig 802). Video footage has been uncovered of his presentation atMiramar College in San Diego in which he talked about ‘temporal illusions’ whichhe defined as ‘an illusion that allows you to change the past’. Holmes referredin the video presentation to a John Jacobson who he called his ‘mentor’.Jacobson is described as a ‘philosopher’ and researcher of cognitive sciences atthe San Diego University Salk Institute. He has said: ‘... it’s possible... forus to manipulate temporal order, we have loads of power over temporal order, ifevents happen in the order A/B, a good psychophysicist can have the subjectexperience it as B/A. This is routine.’ Jacobson trashed Holmes as a person anda student after the shooting. Holmes said that he was working on ‘subjectiveexperience, which is what takes place inside the mind as opposed to the externalworld’. Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen reports that in the two yearsbefore Holmes served as a research intern at the Salk Institute it was partneredwith the appalling Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), theresearch and developed arm of the Pentagon with major emphasis on mindmanipulation and control. Holmes’ father also had connections with DARPA. Madsensays that the Salk Institute-DARPA research project was part of the DARPA ‘PeakSoldier Performance Program’ which involves the development of ‘brainmachineinterfaces for battlefield use’ and ‘human-robotic bionics for legs, arms, andeyes’. Most people have no idea how easy it is to control someone’s mind throughdrugs and hypnotic suggestion using techniques way beyond anything that is seenor known about in mainstream psychiatry (Fig 803). Mind control is not only realit’s commonplace and used to manipulate the minds of many politicians as well assetting up patsies like James Holmes to do their deeds or to get the blame formassacres carried out by military-trained professional killers. Holmes wasclassic on-site mind-control material and a number of observers before and afterthe shootings have described how his eyes fluttered wildly and he repeatedlyblinked. His legal team said that he was mentally ill and asked the judge formore time to assess the nature of his illness. The key question is why he ismentally ill? Holmes, who is said to have called himself ‘The Joker’, was alsoreported to be hooked on the prescription painkiller Vicodin (also known asHydrocodone and Oxycotin), the potential effects of which include ‘alteredmental states’ and ‘unusual thoughts or behavior’. Hydrocodone and Oxycotin wereamong a cocktail of drugs that killed actor Heath Ledger who played ‘The Joker’in a previous Batman movie. For sure, something transformed Holmes’ personalityfrom the quiet, brilliant student of before into the drugged-up, messed-up,drop-out with the brightly-dyed orange hair and faraway eyes who claims toremember nothing about the shooting (Fig 804). I believe him. Then there was theshooting itself. The official story and witness accounts are seriously at oddsas with all staged massacres. Firstly, Holmes was supposed to have enteredthrough a fire escape door that can only be opened from the inside. At best thiswas ridiculously bad planning if the official baloney was true, but as usual inthese cases ‘he’ had an amazing piece of ‘luck’. A witness described how he sawa man with a goatee beard in the front row take a call on his cell phone andthen walk to the fire escape door, push it open, and hold it ajar with his foot.Witness Corbin Dates told CNN:[../Images/00163.jpg]Figure 802: James Holmes before he ‘went strange’.[../Images/00197.jpg]Figure 803: Mind-altering pharmaceutical drugs are a common theme with thoseblamed for mass shootings.[../Images/00070.jpg]Figure 804: James Holmes after his arrest. Anyone in there?> I was sitting in the second row, probably four seats away from the right aisle> where people usually enter from. Another guy walked in after me, sat in front> of me in the front row ... and I noticed he got a phone call.

One said: ‘From what we saw hewasn’t alone. He had someone with him because the second tear gas didn’t comefrom his side.’ Other witnesses said that the police told them they thoughtthere was more than one killer. Officers on the police communication systemreported a suspect in a blue shirt and another said that witnesses were givinghim conflicting descriptions of the gunman. Holmes did not act alone and did heeven act at all? How would anyone know when the gunman was wearing a mask – justas ‘Adam Lanza’ did at Sandy Hook? From my own reading of the evidence Holmesdid not do any shooting but was outside in the parking lot in a drugged andbewildered state so he could be arrested once the professionals had done theirdeed. Holmes was a top-of-the-class student with a highly successful academiccareer before he moved to Colorado University the year before the shooting.Friends and acquaintances from the period that preceded the move to Coloradosaid the media portrayal of him as a loner was very inaccurate. He was describedas a humorous man who got on with everybody and a recommendation by theUniversity of California at Riverside described him as ‘a very effective groupleader’ who ‘takes an active role in his education, and brings a great amount ofintellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom’. Things suddenly beganto rapidly deteriorate when he arrived in Colorado and he was apparently treatedby Dr Lynne Fenton, a psychiatrist at Colorado University, who is said tospecialise in schizophrenia and ‘threat assessment’. Fenton is the medicaldirector of Student Mental Health Services and her online resume says that shesees up to 15 students a week for medication and psychopathy and others in herprivate practice as a psychiatrist. She was also formerly head of physicalmedicine with the US Air Force in San Antonio, Texas (Fig 805). It took ninemonths for official confirmation that Holmes was in possession of theanti-depressant drugs sertraline, a generic version of Zoloft which isprescribed for depression, panic disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder; andClonazepam which has a similar list of claimed effects. Zoloft is the drug thatColumbine killer Eric Harris was taking and Clonazepam (brand name Klonopin) hasbeen called ‘the world’s deadliest pill’ because of its manipulation of brainfunction and high addiction potential. Many studies have connected Zoloft to athousand suicides along with ‘mania and aggression’. Holmes was one of only sixstudents every year accepted into an elite neuroscience programme, a NationalInstitutes of Health training course at the University of Colorado AnschutzMedical Campus in Denver. He was awarded an initial annual grant of more than$20,000 for his studies and turned down a higher grant and free studies at theUniversity of Illinois to go there. His area of research was all to do with themind, the illusion of time, and how the mind could have its sense of realitymanipulated. Ironically, it would strongly appear that exactly this happened tohim after he arrived in Colorado which, as I have detailed in my books over theyears, is one of the epicentres of mind control and Satanism in the UnitedStates. I spent years researching mind control in great detail and meetinghundreds of victims in the United States and worldwide. Many were connected tothe Colorado area, including Denver and Colorado Springs. Holmes is said to havegiven himself up to police without a fight in the theatre car park despite beingsupposedly heavily armed and killing all those people. He is claimed to haveboobytrapped his apartment with such skill and sophistication that it took theFBI two days to make it safe. A spokesman said that ‘the intricacy of thesebombs is something rarely seen outside a war zone’. Where did Holmes get theknowledge to do that with no record of such activity or experience? Policeclaimed that Holmes had set the booby traps to kill anyone who went there, butit was Holmes who told the police that it was dangerous to go to his home andwhy. None of the official story makes any sense because as usual it is a pack oflies.[../Images/00182.jpg]Figure 805: Dr Lynne Fenton. Such lovely eyes.A drug that has been highlighted for possible use on Holmes is Scopolamine, alsoknown as ‘The Devil’s Breath’. It can be added to drinks and food withoutdetection because it has no colour, taste or smell. Scopolamine makes people sodocile and pliable that they will do anything for you, even empty their own bankaccounts and hand you the money while appearing to function perfectly normallyto any onlooker. A drug dealer said of Scopolamine: ‘You own that person ...it’s like they are a child.’ The drug also has the added ‘bonus’ of blockingmemories even under hypnosis and would mean that Holmes would have no idea whathappened to him. Holmes was held at the Arapahoe County Detention Center wherean employee is quoted as saying: ‘He claims he doesn’t know why he’s in jail. Heasked: “Why am I here?”’ Sirhan Sirhan, the alleged killer of Bobby Kennedy in1968 who has been in jail ever since, says that he has no recollection to thisday of killing Kennedy. I have laid out the background in ... And The TruthShall Set You Free for how the assassination was the work of a security guardcalled Thane Eugene Cesar and Sirhan was just the mind-controlled fall guy inthe right place at the right time, or, for him, the other way round. This wouldexplain why 13 shots were fired while Sirhan’s gun could only hold eight (Fig806). We see a similar story in the mass shooting at the Sikh Temple inWisconsin in 2012 (Fig 807). US mind-control programmes are run by the militaryand one of the major centres is Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It just so happensthat the man blamed for the gun attack on the Sikh temple on August 5th 2012 was40-yearold Wade Michael Page who was formerly a ‘psychological operationsspecialist’ at ... Fort Bragg. People have no idea how deeply troops aresubjected to mind control techniques and drugs to manipulate their perceptionsand behaviour (Fig 808). Six people were killed at the temple before Pageallegedly shot himself in the head (so many ‘lone nut’ gunmen kill themselveseither in truth or by the guns of ‘law’ enforcement). Once again it was sold asa ‘lone nut’ shooting when witnesses have spoken of multiple gunmen acting inunison. The Guardian reported:[../Images/00380.jpg]Figure 806: The innocent Sirhan Sirhan, then and now.[../Images/00371.jpg]Figure 807: Wade Michael Page, but where are the other gunmen that witnessesdescribed? Having coffee in a military canteen, no doubt.> One of the wounded men said that an unknown number of gunmen walked into the> kitchen of the Sikh Temple and opened fire. The man who said his father had> been wounded reported that there had been multiple gunmen. Those who had been> inside the building at the time of the attack described it as a very> coordinated thing.[../Images/00097.jpg]Figure 808: Mind-altering drugs are widely given to troops.Another eyewitness told the Associated Press: ‘Between ten and ten-thirty, fourwhite males who were dressed darkly, dressed in all black clothing [as inColorado and Sandy Hook], came in and opened fire on our congregation.’ Thiscould have been confirmed by a surveillance camera inside the temple – but itwas turned off at the time. This is still another common theme as we saw in theOklahoma bombing, 9/11, the London bombings, the assassination of PrincessDiana, the cold-blooded murder by British police of a Brazilian electricianafter he was wrongly identified as a terrorist, and in Aurora and Sandy Hook.Where is the surveillance camera footage from the theatre and the school thatwould show us exactly what happened? Despite what the Sikh witnesses said aboutmultiple gunman the official story was repeated so many times right across themedia that it soon became the version that people believe unless they are awareenough to question what they are told. You can tell what the ‘solution’ isplanned to be in a Problem-Reaction-Solution scenario by the speed andcoordination with which a clear and dominant theme appears immediately afterthey happen. With 9/11 it was Osama bin Laden and with mass shootings it is theneed for more gun control. What is never stated is that Chicago’s stricter guncontrol laws have caused violent crime to soar and the same in Australia becausewhile not even nearly everyone is armed in the United States the criminals can’tbe sure when they invade a home or business who is and who isn’t. Once peopleare unable to own guns legally the criminals are suddenly far more confidentthat you will be helpless when they turn up with weapons that they andterrorists never have a problem securing no matter what the gun laws say. Theyare criminals and terrorists after all.Sandy Hook – what the fuck?Of all these staged mass shootings the one that allegedly took place at SandyHook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut is by far the most bizarre andthere is so much to research and uncover before the full truth of what reallyhappened can be known. The usual glaring contradictions and multiple holes inthe official story that you get with all these mass shootings have been joinedwith regard to Sandy Hook by the truly surreal. We have had a ‘bereaved parent’laughing and joking before moving across to the camera, hyperventilating tosimulate emotion, and then delivering his comments. We have had other interviewswith parents in which there was the same strange absence of genuine emotion anda bloke claiming to be a witness who was captured practicing his lines andclearly simulating emotion before speaking to the media. Some staff at theschool did not appear in official records as recipients of the essentialqualifications to do their jobs. At the time of writing we have littleverifiable evidence and background about the young guy called Adam Lanza who issaid to have shot his mother dead before killing 20 children and six staff atSandy Hook school (Fig 809). Everything has come from the authorities instatements which independent researchers have established again and again do notmake sense or check out. Even a CNN reporter said that they were having a hardtime finding any record of the recent existence of Adam Lanza with no schoolrecords, no friends that knew him or remember him in the past three years andhis own brother said he hadn’t seen him since 2010. ‘He’ was even said to havedestroyed his computer hard drive so that no information could be accessed. Howconvenient. Tom Heneghan, an American writer on intelligence matters, hasreported that Lanza’s mother, Nancy Champion Lanza, was a CIA analyst workingfor the Pentagon’s Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Departmentof Homeland Security. One of DARPA’s specialisations is mind control. The wholeevent was like some sci-fi movie and a lot of research is being done – and needsto be done – to uncover what will be the staggering scale of deceit involvedwith Sandy Hook. There is a tremendous amount of information including manyexcellent videos on the Internet if you want to research this further, but hereare just some of the anomalies and contradictions:[../Images/00145.jpg]Figure 809: The mystery ‘gunman’, Adam Lanza.> • There were media reports that a second gunman had been arrested and was in> custody (here we go again).> • There is video footage of a man being arrested in woods near the school and> the Newtown Bee newspaper reported that this was an off-duty tactical squad> police officer from another town.

Stops briefly to catch breath. The Sandy Hook‘incident’ is so awash with discrepancies, contradictions, blatant untruths andunanswered questions that it is hard to know where to start and one of thetechniques is to bombard people with endless conflicting information to createas much confusion as possible for the truth to be hidden. The reason for SandyHook, as with all the others, was to justify the disarming of Americans.The usual suspectsThe Rothschild Zionist lobby led by Senator Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein weredelivered by catapult to the nearest microphone immediately after Sandy Hook andwe were off with hysterical demands for gun control to ‘protect the public’ (Fig810). New York was the first to impose tougher gun laws in the immediateaftermath of Sandy Hook as you would expect from a city that was the fiefdom ofRothschild Zionist operative Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Author William Burroughs(1914-1997) said long before current events: ‘After a shooting spree, theyalways want to take the guns away from the people who didn’t do it ... I sure ashell wouldn’t want to live in a society where the only people allowed guns arethe police and the military.’ Obama was soon in Feinstein’s slipstream wipingaway non-existent fake tears so ineptly that it would make even the worst B-movie actor look like Marlon Brando (Fig 811). The mainstream media dutifullyreported how Obama ‘cried’. This is the same crowd screaming ‘we must protectthe children’ in the wake of Sandy Hook that so enthusiastically support thecold-blooded murder of children galore across Africa and the Middle and NearEast in drone attacks sanctioned by the signature of President Fake Tears.Feinstein pulled a new gun control bill from her filing cabinet – in the sectionmarked ‘waiting for an opportunity’ – and the media went to work campaigning formore gun controls through personifications of truth and intelligence like CIAintern Anderson Cooper and the clueless Piers Morgan at CNN. Morgan’s role wasto demonise those challenging gun control because they know where it is leadingwhile Cooper was deployed to demonise those questioning the official fairy taleof Sandy Hook – the job that Cooper and Morgan should be doing if they were realjournalists, but are patently not. There was no debate, no rationalconsideration of the issues, just the black and whiteness of textbookpropaganda: guns are bad, what the government says happened did happen, thegovernment was no threat to its own people, and anyone who says otherwise isobviously a terrorist, a hater of children or a conspiracy nut that caresnothing for the feelings of the bereaved. It is the same old story of every oneof these massing killings. New York Mayor and deep insider Michael Bloomberg(Rothschild Zionist) took a break after the Aurora incident from arranging forpeople to live in cupboards to say that police should go on strike until allguns were confiscated (except from them). Actually, police killings have beenfalling while civilian killings by police officers are rising. Maybe it is thepolice that should be disarmed on that basis. Bloomberg was just exploiting thetragedy to push the agenda of his masters – an unarmed population that could beeasily overpowered by an armed-to-the teeth military and police. Film-makerMichael Moore who made a fortune from films like Bowling for Columbine (disarmthe population) and Fahrenheit 911 (which basically supported the official storyof the attacks). He is wheeled out as the representative of the people aftereach staged shooting to call for precisely what Bloomberg demanded. This wasappropriate because both are pillars of the Establishment. The difference isthat Moore claims to be the opposite. He urges Obama to ‘be a leader’ and imposerestrictive gun controls. Moore told CNN after Aurora:[../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 810: I wanted this picture to be warm-hearted, fair, just, open andhonest; but I ended up with Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein. Damn.[../Images/00191.jpg]Figure 811: Mr Fake Tears. Another day; another Teleprompter; another ‘C’ movieperformance.> If people would just rise up and say ‘Damn it, this is not the America I’m> going to live in. This is too great of a country to let this happen again. I> am not going to let this happen again’.Nice one, Mikey. Get the people to demand their own prison. Good thinking. Thegreat man went on: ‘And I am not going to come on another one of these damn TVshows either, after the next one of these shootings ... I’m sick of this.’ Well,that’s good news at least. When asked about people concerned for their safetywhen not being armed in the face of armed criminals he said: ‘If you are worriedabout your safety, get a dog.’ This is the guy who supported Obama for presidentwhen anyone who had a modicum of understanding of how the system works wouldhave known that Obama was just another stooge-for-sale. Some people get wiserwith age, but Moore just seems to get more ridiculous. If he is such a ‘man ofthe people’ how come that every time he opens his mouth he seems to support theArchontic agenda, knowingly or unknowingly? Personally I would not trust Mooreas far as I could throw him which would not be any distance at all (Fig 812).MSNBC’s resident and idiot propagandist, Chris Matthews, even said that thosedefending gun rights were racist – ‘They don’t accept an African-Americanpresident or president of color who has some antecedence in Africa.’ Like I say,idiot. Diane Feinstein’s assignment for decades has been to produce thelegislation to disarm Americans and yet she continues to be protected by armedguards and Obama has signed into the law the right of presidents and theirspouses to have armed protection for the rest of their lives (Fig 813). The termoutrageous hypocrites will not suffice. And that’s the point of all this.Weapons are being taken away from the people, but not from the state and theagents of the state. In fact, the state has never been armed in all history likeit is today and this is becoming more extreme by the week. These liars aretrying to placate opposition to the further disarming of Americans by sayingthat they don’t want to take all guns away just the ones which in truth give thepublic any chance of effective resistance to the planned military coup. YetFeinstein told the CBS 60 Minutes programme as long ago as 1995: ‘If I couldhave got 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban,picking up every one of them ... “Mr and Mrs America, turn ‘em all in”, I wouldhave done it.’ The Feinstein bill gave such a wide definition for ‘assaultweapons’ that you could apply the term to almost any weapon. San Diego PoliceChief, William Lansdowne, who works with the International Association of Chiefsof Police, said that the implementation of new gun laws like those proposed byFeinstein will take guns off the streets of America within a generation – anoutcome he said that he supported. Lansdowne like all these insiders full wellknows what the plan is. White House spokesman Jay Carney said that Obama did notintend to ‘take away a gun from a single law-abiding American’, but that isexactly what is intended in stage after stage starting with so-called assaultweapons. This is what Obama, Feinstein and company were demanding after SandyHook despite a Department of Justice memo leaked to the US National RifleAssociation which said: ‘Assault weapons are not a major contributor to guncrime ... a complete elimination of assault weapons would not have a largeimpact on gun homicides.’ The memo, written by Greg Ridgeway, deputy director ofthe National Institute of Justice, a research, development and evaluation agencyof the Department of Justice, also said:[../Images/00175.jpg]Figure 812: Michael Moore ... ‘man of the people’ but voice of theEstablishment.[../Images/00123.jpg]Figure 813: They call it cognitive dissonance – the ability to think two totallycontradictory thoughts while believing both to be true.> Fatalities from mass shootings (those with 4 or more victims in a particular> place and time) account on average for 35 fatalities per year. Policies that> address the larger firearm homicide issue will have a far greater impact even> if they do not address the particular issues of mass shootings.We should let that figure sink in ... 35 fatalities on average a year from massshootings with four or more victims and even then the major ones like SandyHook, Aurora, Columbine, Wisconsin and so on are clearly staged by themilitary-Intelligence networks to justify ever more gun control. The number ofpeople killed on the roads of America: one every 13 minutes or 155 people a daymany of them children. New gun laws are not about protecting life, but advancingAgenda 21 and while they seek to ban assault weapons among the populationHomeland Security was buying 7,000 fully-automatic assault weapons, sorry‘personal defence weapons’ for use in domestic America. Obama said: ‘AK-47sbelong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals ... they belongon the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities.’ What he didn’t addto that sentence was ‘unless they are in the hands of law enforcement’. He musthave forgotten. The Obama administration of liars and crooks employ any scamthat will get them what they want including fake Twitter accounts specificallycreated to bombard politicians with demands for gun control that were exposed bybloggers and Texas Republican Representative Steve Stockman who received 16identical messages from 16 different addresses. Six were from real people andten were computergenerated. The majority of these accounts supporting Obama’sgun-control campaign were created less than 48 hours before the messages wentout. They don’t care about the will of the people, only their own and those theyanswer to. Then there are all the illinformed, arse-licking, self-promotingcelebrities that are wheeled out to manipulate public opinion. A video wasproduced with a stream of them calling for more gun laws after Sandy Hook butthen someone brilliantly intercut their comments with footage from their filmsand TV programmes in which they took part in violent and bloody gun scenes; butthe most extraordinary contribution came from a bloke called Chris Rock, anactor and alleged alternative comedian. He told a celebrity media event that hewas there to ‘support the president’ who was ... wait for it ... ‘like our boss’and the ‘dad of our country.’ He said:> I am just here to support the President of the United States. The President of> the United States is, you know, our boss. But he’s also, you know, the> president and the first lady are kind of like the mom and the dad of the> country and when your dad says something, you listen.Alternative comedian? Alternative to what? I am so sick of these air-headcelebrities who open their mouths while doing no research or engaging theirbrain. What makes a celebrity’s opinion about anything more worthy than anyoneelse’s? Research is what matters, insight is what matters, not whether you havea good voice or can deliver a line. You can understand why the manipulatorsexploit their ignorance when you can have Arnold Schwarzenegger voted Governorof California by simply having still more airheads standing behind him waving‘We love Arnie’ banners and chanting the same mantra. So many child-like peoplebought the gun control propaganda to call for new laws to advance their ownenslavement (Fig 814). Fortunately, at the time of writing, they have beenunable to impose the most extreme aspects of their gun control agenda, but theywill keep trying and more people will die in staged attacks as they seek tofurther manipulate public opinion.[../Images/00150.jpg]Figure 814: ‘Baaa, baaa, baaaa ...’Just a coincidence ...Another feature of these mass shootings are strange and inexplicable (well, notreally) ‘coincidences’. The audience in the Aurora theatre watched a trailer fora movie called Gangster Squad involving gunmen firing in a movie theatre beforethey experienced the real thing. Work out the statistical chances of that.Another ‘coincidence’ was that a Colorado university just 16 miles from Auroraheld an exercise on the same day to show medical students how to respond to agun attack in a theatre. The Denver Post reported:> Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine is in the middle of> holding specialized classes in disaster life support for 150 second-year> medical students. Along with response to natural disasters like hurricanes and> floods and terrorist attacks, one of the scenarios being used to train the> students is how to respond if a shooter fires at people in a movie theater and> also uses a bomb in the attack.The Rocky Vista Dean Bruce Durbin said: ‘The irony is amazing, just amazing.’ Heain’t kidding, but these things tend to happen with staged terrorist events.Mock drills involving gunmen at schools half an hour’s drive away were happeningat the same time as the Sandy Hook incident; exercises happening at the sametime and in the same airspace as the 9/11 attacks involving simulated hijacksand even included the scenario of a plane flown into a building; an mockemergency drill virtually the same as the real thing was happening at the sametime as the London bombings of 2005; a Danish police bomb exercise ended only 20minutes before the real one went off in the same vicinity in Oslo in 2011; aNATO terrorist exercise in Madrid concluded shortly before the train bombings in2004; and a drill was happening at the same time and in the same place that thebombs exploded at the Boston Marathon in 2013 (another blatantProblem-Reaction-Solution - see Postscript). The Dark Knight Rises Batman moviewas playing on its opening night at the theatre in Aurora and featured a shot ofa map on which the only words you can read are ‘Sandy Hook’ (Fig 815). SuzanneCollins, author of The Hunger Games trilogy, lives in Sandy Hook which is oneheck of coincidence given that Sandy Hook is a village within a country of morethan 300 million people. The bus that was bombed in London in 2005 carried anadvertisement for a horror movie called The Descent which pictured a womanscreaming in a tunnel alongside the words: ‘Outright terror, bold and brilliant’(Fig 816). The film won the Saturn Award for best horror film of the year. TheSandy Hook state of Connecticut is, like Colorado, a prime centre for secretsociety and satanic activity. Sandy Hook is only 25 miles from New Haven, a mostsinister place in terms of atmosphere, and home to Yale University and the Skulland Bones Society. We have the same familiar coincidence of the ‘drill’ themewith the Sandy Hook Elementary School. At the same time that the incident therewas happening there were two drills at schools nearby that involved the samescenario of gunmen on the rampage. One was at Bridgeport, Connecticut 18 milesaway, just down the coast from New Haven, and the other was 25 miles distant inPutnam County just over the border in New York State. Putnam County SheriffDonald B Smith said:[../Images/00300.jpg]Figure 815: What are the statistical chances of such a ‘coincidence’?[../Images/00065.jpg]Figure 816: Another amazing ‘coincidence’?> By grim coincidence, even as the terrible events were unfolding in Newtown on> Friday morning, the Putnam County Emergency Response Team (‘ERT’) happened to> be assembled for regular training in Carmel, and team members were at that> very moment engaged in a mock scenario of an active-shooter in a school.> The ERT is comprised of specially trained and heavily armed officers from the> Sheriff’s Office and the Carmel and Kent Police Departments. When news broke> of the Newtown shooting, the Putnam County ERT commander called Newtown Police> and offered to have the ERT respond to the Sandy Hook school, but that> response was not needed because Connecticut police had already secured the> scene.The fact is though that these ‘grim coincidences’ happen far too often to beexplained away by statistical chance. The Bridgeport drill was the same in bothtime and scenario as what is alleged to have happened at Sandy Hook and it wasrun by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) which I have been exposingsince the early 1990s as a major player in the planned fascist takeover of theUnited States. FEMA was not established to protect and help people at times ofneed and emergency and this is why its work has been roundly criticised andcondemned so often when these disasters occur. FEMA is not there to protect butto control and operate the holding camps (concentration camps) located aroundthe United States waiting for those who are due to disappear when the militaryare planned to make their move. If FEMA is involved in something it is theArchontic agenda, end of story, and FEMA was running the drill in Bridgeport 18miles from Sandy Hook in the same time period. If that is a coincidence then myname is Mary and I have decided to come out as a closet transvestite. Oooh,those knickers are tight. The drill was code named FEMA L-366 and like all ofthese dry runs they are operated for real. They have been happening around thecountry since the shooting at Columbine High School and are becoming morefrequent. They include having children bussed to ‘alternate locations’ duringterror drills and ‘undisclosed locations’ that even their parents are notallowed to know. The London Daily Mail featured one at Petersen AlternativeCenter for Education in Modesto, California, with the headline ‘Bodies litterCalifornia campus in mock massacre as staff and students prepare for anotherSandy Hook’. The drill used actors to play the part of two ‘troubled students’who went on the rampage at the school attacking other students and when 911 wascalled the local police and SWAT team arrived with guns at the ready. Fake bloodwas used to add to the realism and you can see from the pictures how authenticit would have appeared to anyone who was not in the loop (Figs 817 and 818). Isaw video of the drill on the Internet and anyone who didn’t know would havethought it was the real thing with gun shots, screaming and people running inall directions. There was even a loudspeaker announcement from the police thatsaid ‘this is a lockdown, this is not a drill, this is a lockdown’. There waspublic criticism for ‘pretending to kill kids’. This was a report of a ‘drill’at an early learning centre in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, designed to traumatisechildren and staff:[../Images/00366.jpg]Figure 817: It may look real, but they’re all actors.[../Images/00404.jpg]Figure 818: People run terrified for cover during these fake ‘drills’, but it isall a stage show.> About 50 teachers at a New Jersey school experienced a terrifying moment when> a shooting rampage turned out to be a drill, but the teachers didn’t know it.> It happened Aug. 28 at the Phillipsburg New Jersey Early Learning Center.> A man burst into the library and started shooting. But the gun didn’t have any> bullets, just blanks. Teachers took cover under child-sized tables, crying and> trembling. ‘People are crying. The girl next to me is trembling and shaking.> You heard people crying. You heard other people praying. It was pretty> dramatic,’ one teacher said.Remind you of anywhere? A third-grader from Sandy Hook speaking on televisionsaid: ‘When we were having a drill, we were hiding under, like ...’ and thenstopped. FEMA documents regarding these school exercise drills require keyparticipants to wear identification cards around their necks and there areexamples galore of this in pictures taken at the scene in Sandy Hook. Paul Vanceof the Connecticut State Police, who avoided any challenging questions aboutSandy Hook and warned that anyone ‘spreading rumours’ (questioning the officialstory) would be prosecuted, has taken part in many of these mock drills. He wasthe Prat-in-the-Hat who became the official face of Sandy Hook. I wouldpersonally not trust him or Connecticut Chief Medical Examiner Wayne Carver totell me the date in a calendar factory (Fig 819). Carver said that he hadexamined the bodies of the ‘deceased’ and yet could not answer basic questionsabout them from the media. A mother was shocked to see a photograph of herdaughter who was very much alive and living in Louisiana appear in the media asone of the Sandy Hook victims. As I said earlier, there are extraordinaryrevelations to come out about Sandy Hook. The police officer speakinganonymously on the radio show said of ‘Adam Lanza’ and the Sandy Hook incident:[../Images/00384.jpg]Figure 819: The Prat-in-the-Hat and the other guy.> And again it needs to be stressed no video or photographic evidence supporting> anything that would indicate this young person of that build that you> described carried this off on his own, nothing at all to support it in any way> and again, who were the three men who were detained ... who were those guys?> What sort of magical powers do they have to be detained and then just get to> disappear after one of the most heinous school massacres in US history?> We have not been told that any picture images or video footage was obtained of> the incident by law enforcement and to date I have not seen a single crime> scene photograph of the inside or the outside of that school. I think that is> very unusual with the amount of time that has now passed and if we go by the> official story about Lanza being a lone gunman and that is being treated as it> is clear cut and dry then why is the Connecticut state police saying that the> investigation could take months, how much more evidence is there?Why did the town clerk of Newtown specifically set out to deny the media accessto public record death certificates from the Sandy Hook incident and marriagecertificates of parents? The New York Post, Connecticut Post, Associated Press,Hartford Courant, and others requested this information but Town Clerk DebbieAurelia said she was working with State representatives and the leadership ofthe state association of town clerks to introduce new legislation that wouldallow only limited information and withhold the actual death and marriagecertificates. These are public record documents. What are they trying to hide?They claim to be ‘protecting the families’, but from what? Jim Smith, presidentof the Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information, said:> There isn’t anything in a death certificate that is going to hurt the deceased> ... it’s not like an autopsy report. It’s been public for centuries. It’s not> going to invade anyone’s privacy.Documents that have been publicly available for centuries and suddenly in thiscase they are denied. Why? Political representatives and Newtown officials alsosaid they were concerned about identity theft but that information is on thebirth certificates which they were not trying to block and what about theidentity theft potential of all the death certificates for everyone else inAmerica that are available on the public record? Why do they have no problemwith documents which prove that people were born but not that they areofficially dead. Vance-the-Hat had basically told the media that talking to thefamilies was out of bounds because the families had requested that. Then we hadthe statement by the Connecticut State Attorney in a court motion arguing fordocuments relating to the case to remain secret because there may be ‘otherpotential suspects’. Where did that come from when the lone nutter gunman (asusual) was the official story? It all stinks like a fish factory and I repeat:This is the event for which Jesse Ventura says there is no evidence ofgovernment involvement. God help us.Say they’re all crazyImmediately after the Wisconsin shooting the theme was ‘domestic terrorism’.This is the plan to label anyone who challenges the global conspiracy as adomestic terrorist. The FBI and the Department of Homeland (Fatherland) Securitysays that ‘extremist domestic organizations are just as dangerous as terrorismfrom foreign organizations’. Neither is as dangerous and deadly as ‘democratic’governments. ‘Domestic terrorism’, or alleged signs of it, are defined inever-wider terms and now include speaking out against government policies;protesting against anything; opposing war and mass murder through drone strikesand other means; using cash and not credit cards; challenging the evil andcorrupt banking system; using alternative local currencies; challenging the megacorporations; stockpiling food; having bumper stickers highlighting the loss offreedoms or supporting people who are oppressed; taking still or video pictures;opposing genetically-engineered crops and food; eating, producing or promotingorganic food; supporting small growers and farmers; and anything else that isnot good for the Archon agenda. Wisconsin ‘gunman’ Wade Page was portrayed as awhite supremacist and neo-Nazi and the idea is that you make this theallencompassing collective image of anyone challenging government or corporatedictatorships (except Michael Moore). The media predictably quoted theRothschild Zionist organisations especially created to sell a belief interrorism and domestic terrorism and to target anyone who gets too close to thetruth about the forces – many of them Rothschild Zionist in nature – that areleading the world into an Orwellian nightmare. These media ‘sources’ include theRothschild-established Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Southern Poverty LawCenter (SPLC) and SITE (Search for International Terrorist Entities). SITE isrun by Rothschild Zionist Rita Katz and was a source of the fake ‘Bin Laden’videos in the years after his death in 2001 from Marfan syndrome. Mark Potok,senior fellow of the Southern Poverty Law Center, ‘which monitors hate groups’so long as they are not based in Israel, said his organisation had been trackingPage for years, but then they track anyone who challenges the neo-Nazis behindIsrael and Rothschild Zionism – including myself (Fig 820). Potok, the SPLC(Spreading Propaganda for Low-life Clients) chief spokesman and director ofpublications and [dis]information, is given free rein on MSNBC and other mediato demonise anyone challenging government tyranny and the conspiracy to disarmAmericans, often through ‘interviews’ with MSNBC lightweights and governmentpropagandists like Chris ‘a thrill going up my leg’ Matthews. I am not sayingthat Wade Page was god’s gift to humanity, but compare what those blamed forthese shootings have done with what those in government doing the blaming andcondemning inflict upon the world every day. Did Wade Page order the deaths ofthousands of innocent people through drone bombing attacks in Pakistan andelsewhere? No, but Obama has. Did James Holmes lie to justify bombing wholetowns and cities of civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, ad infinitum? No, butObama, Bush, Blair and Cameron have and they can’t get to a microphone quickenough to condemn terrorists, domestic or otherwise. It is classic Orwell/Archoninversion. War is peace and the true terrorists are the peacemakers; themass-killers of civilians are the civilian protectors; and the Satanists are theGod-worshippers.[../Images/00432.jpg]Figure 820: Mark Potok from the very rich Southern Poverty Law Center.[../Images/00178.jpg]Figure 821: Brandon J Raub is arrested by the mob for expressing an opinion.The involuntary detention of a former US Marine in a psychiatric hospital in2012 for the crime of criticising the government on the Internet is a definingmoment in terms of how far we have now gone along the road to State fascism. Ifthis is not a wake-up call then it is hard to imagine what it would take forpeople to see the obvious and break free from denial. Brandon J Raub served inboth Iraq and Afghanistan, but as I have been trying to get across for so longto those in uniform the State machine that they serve does not give a damn aboutthem (Fig 821). They are just fodder to kill and be killed in service to thecause of human enslavement – including their own. They are ‘heroes andprotectors of freedom’ when they are fit enough the serve the agenda, but whenthey can’t through illness or injury they are treated with contemptuousdisinterest; while they support the State they are left alone, but when theychallenge the State they are condemned, called a ‘domestic terrorist’ and lockedaway in a psychiatric hospital. Henry Kissinger (Rothschild Zionist) describedAmerican troops as ‘dumb, stupid animals’ to be used to impose US foreign policyand in that sentence he revealed the true relationship between the cowards inthe suits and the shadows and those who unknowingly serve their cause inuniform. Kissinger was speaking privately, but his words later appeared in abook by Watergate journalist, Bob Woodward. It should have made him persona nongrata to those who scream about ‘supporting the troops’, but it hasn’t.Kissinger and company go on manipulating the wars for his ‘dumb, stupid animals’to blindly fight. What happened to 26-year-old Brandon J Raub has fundamentalimplications far beyond just the military. It affects and threatens everybody.This is not a one-off; it is a plan of operation. A judge ordered that Raub bereleased on appeal amid much public outrage at the way he was treated, but somany others remain in psychiatric wards as a way of taking them out ofcirculation and they do not have the publicity that the Raub case rightlyattracted. We have seen this technique of suppression many times before in humanhistory, most memorably in the Soviet Union where those who questioned,challenged and exposed the tyranny of the (Rothschild-created) Soviet State wereimprisoned in psychiatric hospitals to be silenced and mind-manipulated to‘revise’ their views. This is what they planned to do with Raub had they beenable to hold him for longer. He was taken into custody for what theArchon-controlled FBI called ‘ominous posts’ on Facebook which referred to an‘upcoming revolution’. Here is a sample of what he said:> This is the land where you can start from the bottom and get to the top. This> is the land where regardless of [your] race and ethnicity you can succeed and> build a better life for you and your family. This is the land where every race> coexists peacefully. This is the land where justice wins. This is the land> where liberty dwells. This is the land where freedom reigns. This is the land> where we help the poor, and people help each other. This is [the] land where> people beat racism.Many of those statements have not been true in relation to America for at leasta long time, probably ever, but you can see where he is coming from. He lovesAmerica and has a vision for what he would like it to be. It is an infinitelybetter vision than those who incarcerated him. ‘We must take our Republic back’,he said, and rightly so. Other posts questioned the role in America’s demise ofthe Federal Reserve, income tax, wars of acquisition, the destruction of freedomand politicians controlled by special interests ‘brainwashed through the Councilon Foreign Relations’. He also offered his opinion that 9/11 was an inside job,which anyone with a mind of their own can clearly see, and he posted a pictureof the hole in the Pentagon and asked ‘where’s the plane?’ I may not be comingfrom the stance of an American patriot, but I have said many times most of whatRaub said and far more in terms of challenging the tyranny of the global State.The Internet is awash with people with views and opinions like those and that isthe point of all this. Brandon Raub and his like are a means to an end, not theend in itself. Those exposing the coordinated hijacking of Planet Earth and thesubjugation of the human population have become far too effective in awakeningothers to their individual and collective plight. The ‘New Order’ is in dangerfrom this exposure and so it is time to destroy that challenge to itsomnipotence before the house of cards doth fall. Many of us involved in thisexposure have had to cope with being attacked financially, legally and verballyby often State-sponsored or self-obsessed idiots who do not have theintelligence to see that they and their children and grandchildren will have tolive in the nightmare world that we are seeking to prevent. Many won’t even carewhat happens to their children and grandchildren – it’s not their problem. Oh,but it is. Tyranny is not coming – it’s here, in the world they are living in,yet still they target those with the guts to put their head above the trenchwhile they hide deep in the shadows behind anonymous log-in names and fakepublic personas. Anyone who has ever tried to do anything worthwhile has alwaysfaced abuse from the blind, moronic and self-obsessed. The writer Jonathan Swiftsaid: ‘When a great genius appears in the world you may know him by this sign;that the dunces are all in confederacy against him’. For those who have giventheir lives to exposing the global conspiracy the abuse by idiots – not least inthe media – is an occupational hazard that you must either accept or step aside,but the treatment of Brandon Raub took us well beyond the realms of the merelymoronic and into a whole new stage of the global game. The goonatics are nowseeking to target the people and the information sources of the people withconcerted efforts, for example, to censor the Internet using ‘terrorism’ andcopyright as the excuse. So head up, chest out, strap in. It is a challenge thatwe must be big enough and immovable enough to meet and deal with. Brandon Raubwas questioned by secret service agents and the ludicrous FBI about his postsand then put before a judge who ordered his forced detention at the SalemVeterans Affairs hospital for a period of up to 30 days. His mother KathleenThomas said that her son was given a mental assessment for just 15 minutes ‘andbasically the evaluator said that he was not ready to go back into society andhe needed additional psychiatric treatment.’ Does anyone believe that the socialworker, psychiatrist and ‘Special Justice’ involved were not selected to givethe opinion and judgement that the authorities demanded? It happens all the timeand this is how they rig the system against their targets. The law allows forcommitment to a psychiatric hospital on the recommendation of a ‘mental healthprofessional’ (many of whom need serious help themselves) and so all you need isone of those ‘professionals’ to give the right recommendation and the law isactivated. Brandon Raub was represented by the Virginia-based civil libertiesgroup, the Rutherford Institute, and executive director John Whitehead describedthe farcical events at the hearing which ordered Raub be detained. He said thatthe initial order was rubber-stamped:> The special justice is very old. He had trouble hearing Brandon. He brought> into the courtroom a personal cassette player – we tried to listen to it and> you can hardly hear what’s being said. This is the so-called judge – he’s a> lawyer, not a real judge – it’s like what you would see in a bad movie.> There’s a system here that is corrupt. And this guy is caught in it. I’m> friends with the local police; I could call them right now and probably get> you committed if you were in Virginia. They can arrive at your door based on> somebody’s testimony or your Facebook page and take you away to a mental> hospital.Whitehead added – chillingly – that 20,000 people are committed under similarcircumstances in Virginia alone every year. ‘That means a lot of people aredisappearing under the pretext of mental illness’, he said. ‘People all over thecountry are just disappearing.’ What was it that Dr Richard Day said in 1969?‘There will be no “martyrs” and people will just disappear.’ Whitehead alsodescribed how Raub had called him from the hospital to say that a psychiatristhad told him that he was going to be brainwashed and have medication forced uponhim. This was revealed on this occasion because the case had a high profile butthis is happening secretly to thousands of people and increasingly because oftheir opinion that the government is corrupt, dangerous and was the force behind9/11. The authorities were in trouble once details of the Raub case began tocirculate on the Internet and it shows the power that we have if only we wouldget involved and use it. A second hearing, before Circuit Judge W Allan Sharret,ruled that the detention of Raub was illegal because incredibly no grounds forholding him were included in the detention order. John Whitehead called Sharret‘a rare gem’ in a corrupt judicial system. Watch your back, judge. Raub was alsohandcuffed and forcibly taken away in a police vehicle without being served witha warrant or read his rights. Police said that this was not necessary because hewasn’t being arrested or facing criminal charges, just held against his will.Definition of arrest: ‘To seize and hold under the authority of law’ and ‘theact of detaining in legal custody’. He was arrested. Another scam when peopleare targeted is to say that the authorities acted after ‘complaints from thepublic’. Of course, we are never told who made the complaints or allowed to seethem. Dee Rybiski, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Intimidation (FBI),said:> We received quite a few complaints about what were perceived as threatening> posts. Given the circumstances with the things that have gone on in the> country with some of these mass shootings, it would be horrible for law> enforcement not to pay attention to complaints.Yeah, sure, and bats can play Scrabble. A number of the comments highlighted bythe FBI were made on a closed page not available to the wider public and somewere made by Raub’s brother, not him. Raub said:> I’ve been very open with the things I’ve had to say on my wall on Facebook.> It’s interesting to me that the Government is watching Facebook in the first> place. That ought to raise some eyebrows and cause some good American citizens> some concern.The force that controls the FBI also controls Facebook. Raub was not accused ofanything or charged with anything but locked away on the say-so ofState-controlled police, a State-controlled ‘judge’ and a State-appointedpsychiatrist and the whole sequence was triggered by ‘complaints’ that we neversee. We are looking at the new norm here unless we meet this en masse. It isencouraging to see that many became involved on the Internet in challenging thisoutrage and the publicity for the case and the public response both highlightedhow deep we are in the foothills of full-blown fascism and how effective aconcerted public reaction can be. The Rutherford Institute’s John Whiteheadsaid:> For government officials to not only arrest Brandon Raub for doing nothing> more than exercising his First Amendment rights but to actually force him to> undergo psychological evaluations and detain him against his will goes against> every constitutional principle this country was founded upon.Ironically, they are proving that Raub’s views in his Facebook postings werecorrect. Whitehead rightly said that he found nothing alarming in Raub’spostings and the prime concern was that government officials are monitoringprivate Facebook pages and detaining people with whom they disagree:> This should be a wake-up call to Americans that the police state is here.> Brandon Raub is no different from the majority of Americans who use their> private Facebook pages to post a variety of content, ranging from song lyrics> and political hyperbole to trash talking their neighbours, friends and> government leaders.The treatment of Raub is part of a much bigger plan of operation and cannot beseen in its true context without the big picture. They are starting to play outin earnest a long-planned campaign of demonising those who have realised thatthe system is corrupt and evil and especially against those who are mosteffective in exposing that truth and the hidden networks behind it. They want tocrush all protest and dissent (Fig 822). Demos, a British ‘think-tank’ close togovernment, showed what is planned and how terrified the conspirators are ofexposure when it called for the authorities to infiltrate conspiracy websites inan effort to ‘increase trust in the government’. When passed through theOrwellian Translation Unit this means ‘keep from the public what would make themtotally lose trust in the government’. This approach has been pioneered byObama’s White House information ‘czar’ Cass Sunstein (Rothschild Zionist) whoalso called for conspiracy ‘theories’ to be taxed or banned. What has happenedto Brandon Raub fits this perfectly. Paint them as dangerous or mad, andpreferably dangerous and mad. The FBI says that it ‘expects to see a surge insovereign citizen members as the American economy continues to remain stagnant... and Internet sites influence others about the ideology’. One way of spottinga ‘domestic terrorist’ according to FBI documents is that someone is ‘overlyconcerned with their privacy’. Those of us who are known for circulating thisinformation will be dubbed inciters of violence and there will be calls to havesuch information banned. The mainstream media will play its part because that isits job. What other use does it have in its current state with a few exceptions?When you see some of the responses to the state kidnapping of Brandon Raub it isclear that many people will be cheering on the authorities as those seeking toprotect their freedoms are targeted. One chap using the log-in name ‘Adam’ madethis comment on Brandon Raub’s forced incarceration in a psychiatric hospitalfor merely expressing his views:[../Images/00320.jpg]Figure 822: ‘We support free speech – we just didn’t say where.’> If we did this more often maybe we could prevent a massacre once in a while.> He’s not under arrest and if he is sane and poses no threat then he’s free to> go. But the same people who are ‘furious’ about his detainment would be the> first ones to accuse the police of doing nothing had he done some harm. We> need more of this kind of preventative action. – Adam, USA, 21/8/2012 18:10Another giant intellect speaks. How’s the kids, Adam, alright? This mentality istoo ignorant to see that it itself is a far greater danger to the world thanBrandon J Raub will ever be."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00137.jpg]The Orwellian Global State (2)It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely satback and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.Leonardo Da VinciBritain and increasingly other countries are drowning in millions ofsurveillance cameras which have a strange habit of not working when it would bebad for the authorities. There are reported to be 11,000 cameras on the Londonunderground, but the relevant ones were not working when the police held down aninnocent Brazilian man and shot him in the head at point blank range seventimes. The same happened with the Oklahoma bombing, 9/11, the London bombings,ad infinitum. Cameras are only to keep the people in line, not the crazies (Fig823 and 824).New York’s Mayor Bloomberg said that he wanted surveillance cameras on everystreet in the city and every traffic light corner. The latter are being sold onthe premise of saving lives and anyone that resists them therefore doesn’t careabout human life; but if that was true then Bloomberg would be resisting them,surely. There will be plenty in Bloomberg’s New York Agenda 21 ‘apartment’blocks and that’s a certainty. US District Judge William Griesbach ruled in 2012that police can set up covert surveillance cameras on private property withoutjudicial approval or permission from the owner. The International CriminalPolice Organization (Interpol) wants to see cameras in every aircraft seat to‘identify terrorists and other dangers to passengers’, and the Baltimore Sunreported that city officials have sanctioned the recording of privateconversations on public transport ‘to investigate crimes, accidents and poorcustomer service’. The justification for this Orwellian tyranny: ‘We want tomake people feel safe.’ Well resign, then. Baltimore today and everywheretomorrow. Cameras are already installed in ATMs and they are being proposed forcigarette vending machines and supermarket check-outs, and technology now existsto film and record people in their own homes through the television via camerasand microphones installed in cable boxes in line with George Orwell’s concept ofthe ‘Telescreen’. The technology is justified on the grounds of analysing viewerresponses, behaviour and statements with regard to advertisements to target thathousehold with particular products; but the real reason is state surveillance inevery home. Australia is hardly a bastion of terrorism – except in government –but Australians are being subjected to gathering powers of surveillance andmonitoring every bit as intrusive as those in the United States and thisincludes the recording and retention of communications by Internet, phone andany other technological means. This is not about terrorism; it’s about control –total control (Fig 825). The same is happening all over because it is globallycoordinated with ‘anti-terror’ laws specifically worded to allow them to be usedagainst the population in general. The organisation Big Brother Watch revealedin 2012 that British local authorities had carried out 9,607 covert surveillanceoperations over three years to spy on the public under the Regulation ofInvestigatory Powers Act (RIPA) which was supposedly aimed at only serious crimeand terrorism. Some of the serious crime and terrorism involved included TVlicence evasion, trading standards offences, benefit fraud and fly-tipping, notclearing up dog shit, people breaching the smoking ban, garden centres sellingpot plants and people with unlicensed parrots. We have had local councils inBritain using ‘anti-terrorist’ legislation to follow parents and obtain detailsof their phone calls and texts to see if they really live in the catchment areathat qualifies their children to attend certain schools. These people are nuts,just programmed software. Among those misusing ‘terrorist’ laws has been thedepartment of government known as the BBC and peaceful activists returning fromsupporting Palestinians have been arrested and questioned at British airportsunder anti-terrorist legislation. Even the UK Information Commissioner haspublicly condemned the mandatory recording of people’s conversations in taxis.Christopher Graham condemned the use of audio recorders and CCTV cameras inlicensed taxi cabs in the city of Southampton as ‘disproportionate’. Bloodytotalitarian more like. The Electric Frontier Foundation says of Internet‘security:[../Images/00003.jpg]Figure 823: ‘Good jaaaab, Tony’ ... ‘You, too, Georgie.’[../Images/00013.jpg]Figure 824: We’re watching everyone and everything – except when the governmentkills people, plants a bomb or stages a mass shooting.[../Images/00427.jpg]Figure 825: ‘Every move you make, every step you take, we’ll be watching you...’> There are almost no restrictions on what can be collected and how it can be> used, provided a company can claim it was motivated by ‘cybersecurity> purposes’ That means a company like Google, Facebook, Twitter, or AT&T could> intercept your emails and text messages, send copies to one another and to the> government, and modify those communications or prevent them from reaching> their destination if it fits into their plan to stop cybersecurity threats.[../Images/00071.jpg]Figure 826: Regina Dugan – from DARPA to Google. A strange career move unlessyou know what is going on.But even worse than taxis, they are putting security cameras into school toiletsand changing rooms. By mid-2012 some 200 schools in the UK had done this using825 cameras and the plan is for many more to follow. Nick Pickles, director ofBig Brother Watch, said: ‘This research raises serious questions about theprivacy of schoolchildren across Britain, with some schools having one camerafor every five pupils and hundreds of schools using cameras in toilets andchanging rooms.’ This is all part of the process of preparing children to becomeadults that will unquestioningly accept total surveillance as the norm and, aswith full body scanners, it is also a free-for-all for paedophiles who suddenlydevelop a passion for working in ‘security’. There are now an estimated 110,000cameras in UK schools and they are even adding them to rubbish collectionvehicles in the English city of York. The surveillance that is actually going onis far in excess of even the extremes that are made public and its technologicalsophistication continues to expand through the Pentagon’s science anddevelopment arm, the sinister beyond sinister, Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency (DARPA). The closeness and connections between the Pentagon,Intelligence agencies and the giants of the Internet can be seen in the move byDARPA director Regina Dugan to become a senior executive with Google (Fig 826).Max Kelly, Chief Security Officer at Facebook, also left to join the evilNational Security Agency (NSA) and that is no surprise when the Internet giantsand the Intelligence networks are so fundamentally interconnected. It wasrevealed in 2012 that Internet and phone companies were installing ‘black boxes’to monitor UK phone calls, emails and social networking communications. This wasincluded in the government’s communications data bill proposed by the sameConservative Party of Rothschild Zionist David Cameron which promised to rollback the Big Brother state of Tony Blair but have taken it to even greaterextremes in Britain’s one-party politics. Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP whosaid that he opposed the plan, said: ‘The use of data mining and black boxes tomonitor everyone’s phone, email and web-based communications is a soberingthought that would give Britain the most intrusive surveillance regime in thewest.’ Surveillance record after surveillance record is being broken as Agenda21 speeds on and black boxes are also being built into new cars to track drivingactivity. General Keith Alexander, head of the corrupt and criminal US NationalSecurity Agency (NSA), has called for everyone to be given an Internet code thatcan track activity on the Web while DARPA, the Pentagon’s technologydevelopmentagency, has announced what it calls ‘Plan X’ to dominate cyberspace for‘security’ reasons and to attack the computer systems of military targets (readcomputer systems of people targets). The NSA is also establishing the Utah DataCenter, a multibillion dollar global surveillance operation (Fig 827). One newsreport said of its capability: ‘Flowing through its servers and routers andstored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication,including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Googlesearches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails – parking receipts,travel itineraries, bookstore purchases and other digital “pocket litter”.’ Thisis part of a programme known as Total Information Awareness and includes thepopulation being tracked by satellite. This information is made available tolocal law enforcement and civilian agencies. The NSA, headquartered in black boxand black-cube-like buildings at Fort Meade, Maryland, is the boss of the CIAand has had an almost limitless expansion of its budget since 9/11 (Fig 828).[../Images/00231.jpg]Figure 827: The Utah Data Center.[../Images/00155.jpg]Figure 828: The appropriately black headquarters of the US National SecurityAgency (NSA).The Rothschild-Rockefeller created-and-controlled United Nations produced a148-page UN report entitled ‘The Use of the Internet for Terrorist Purposes’ tojustify global Internet surveillance. This is why they released militarytechnology to allow the Internet to be established. The upside of this was thepotential for total surveillance and the downside, the free flow of information,is what they are now seeking to delete. The UN report demands surveillance ofinstant messaging, chatrooms and Skype, with detailed records retained, and‘registration for the use of Wi-Fi networks or cybercafes could provide animportant data source for criminal investigations’. It further calls for‘location data’ to be monitored and retained and the technology now exists thatpredicts future movements from this information. Among other new toys in the waron human freedom is a laser-scanner that can detect minute detail about you frommore than 160-feet away. This includes adrenaline levels, illegal substances andtraces of gun powder. The Picosecond Programmable Laser strikes the target withlasers that vibrate molecules which can then be read to establish whatsubstances a person has been exposed to. An Alabama company called IDair saysthat it has developed a system to scan and identify fingerprints from nearly 20feet away and UK police have been testing a new laser gun that can temporarilyblind people from 500 yards. The SMU 100 projects a three-metre ‘wall of light’and is aimed at use during protests and ‘riots’. (The London riots of 2011,which were allowed to happen as the police were ordered to stand aside, were aProblem-Reaction-Solution to justify upgrades in people control.) The SMU 100was officially developed to target pirates in Somalia but now we are seeing thereal reason – the domestic population. Paul Kerr managing director ofClyde-based Photonic Security Systems, which designed the weapon, said: ‘Thesystem would give police an intimidating visual deterrent ... If you can’t lookat something you can’t attack it.’ It can also be said of Kerr and his companythat if you have your eyes only on the bottom line you can’t see the world youare helping to build for your children and grandchildren. The European Union haslaunched a five-year ‘research’ programme (a will-do programme) called ProjectIndect, to develop computer software for the ...> ... construction of agents assigned to continuous and automatic monitoring of> public resources such as: websites, discussion forums, usenet groups, file> servers, p2p [peer-to-peer] networks as well as individual computer systems,> building an Internet-based intelligence gathering system, both active and> passive.Its goals include the ‘automatic detection of threats and abnormal behaviour orviolence’ and it is part of a massive expansion of EU surveillance and lawenforcement to impose a ‘common culture’ (centralised control) across the wholeof Europe. Stephen Booth, an analyst with Open Europe, said: ‘This is all prettyscary stuff in my book. These projects would involve a huge invasion ofprivacy.’ I have been warning about all this for nearly a quarter of a centuryamid so much dismissal and ridicule and now here we are. While the United Statesgovernment says there has to be surveillance and control of the Internet to stopcyber-attacks both the US and Israel have been exposed for creating and usingsome of the most destructive computer viruses and using them against countriesin the Middle East and elsewhere. These include the viruses known as Stuxnet andFlame.Every step you take ... we’ll be watching youWherever you walk or drive you are being increasingly monitored with facerecognition and number plate cameras that can immediately scan a stream of databases for your identity and background. Street cameras are being fitted withmicrophones to record conversations and with speakers to allow security guardsto give orders to people they have spotted on their surveillance screens. Putthe name ‘Intellistreets’ into YouTube and you’ll see what I mean. Most of thevideo promotes the energy-saving and advertising potential which are claimed forIntellistreets (‘Intelligence Streets’), but the real deal is the recording andbroadcasting network that operates through every lamp standard in every street(Fig 829). The promotional video’s throwaway closing line says that‘Intellistreets also enable a myriad of Homeland Security solutions’. Thank-you,we’ve got to the point at last and this network is planned to connect with theSmart Meter-Smart Grid technology in the home and workplace so that surveillanceand perception manipulation continues wherever you are. There is now mobile‘backscatter’ technology which is the same as the full-body airport scanners butemitting 50 times more radiation. They are mobile enough to be used from apolice or other law enforcement vehicle and they allow the authorities to X-rayyou in your car, home or business without your knowledge from unmarked vanstaking naked pictures of whoever they like while dosing the people in radiation.They can sit outside your home and see what is going on inside. Put the words‘Backscatter vans – Joseph Reiss’ into YouTube and you will see a marketing manpromoting this technology apparently oblivious of the consequences for thetargets and what this means for the world that his children and grandchildrenwill have to live in. It’s all about money and a jaaaab. There are surveillancecameras that monitor for ‘suspicious behaviour’ and body language, and recogniseindividual faces which are then scanned through the databases, and algorithmsthat can be integrated into cameras to detect if someone is drunk in a publicplace. Britain’s National Physical Laboratory, apparently in collaboration withthe Center for Advanced Software Technology, the BBC and BAE Systems, hasdeveloped surveillance cameras to identify people by the way they walk. An RTreport said:[../Images/00409.jpg]Figure 829: Intellistreets – surveillance technology on every lamp standard forwhen you are not being watched by your television or recorded by your car.> In each video frame, the system separates an individual’s silhouette from its> background.

A computer can then produce a list of all the other places that the> person has visited, and the occasions they have been there.‘Wireless solutions’ to security (control) are everywhere today. Intellistreetsare only one example. A promotional paper by the bloodline corporation Motorolais almost orgasmic in its delight that ‘wireless video solutions aretransforming police work before our very eyes’, by allowing 24/7 visuals oftheir communities: commercial districts, neighbourhoods, high-risk areas,crowded public events, dangerous intersections, public transit vehicles,municipal buildings and much more – even when they’re not physically on thescene. The paper says that the technology allows for ‘round-the-clock visualmonitoring [surveillance] of their communities from a centralized controlcenter’. Yes, in accordance with the demands of Agenda 21. Motorola goes onabout ‘public safety’ when it is all about public control. The paper quotes AldoPunzo, a technical manager with ISP Bettini Video, with regard to the policingof a small Italian town: ‘Their video surveillance system allows the two-manpolice force of Sergnano, Italy, to control 100 percent of the territory withoutmoving from the control room’. American author and campaigner Naomi Wolf wrotein the Guardian about a friend who was outraged that he and his girlfriend couldcomplete a ride at Disneyland and then be asked if he wanted a picture of him onthe ride by Disney staff who already had his credit details on the computer. Herealised that this could only have been done through face recognition technologyand he claimed that face shots at Disney were being shared with the military.Wolf said that News21 had confirmed that Disney was indeed doing this and thatIdentix, the face recognition contractor involved, had contracts with themilitary for face recognition technology. Wolf also noticed that strange-lookingcameras were being positioned around New York and she posted a picture askingfor anyone to tell her what they were. She wrote:> Commentators who had lived in China said that they were the same> camera/streetlight combinations that are mounted around public places in> China. These are enabled for facial recognition technology, which allows> police to watch video that is tagged to individuals, in real time. When too> many people congregate, they can be dispersed and intimidated simply by the> risk of being identified – before dissent can coalesce.> (Another of my Facebook commentators said that such lamppost cameras had been> installed in Michigan, and that they barked ‘Obey’, at pedestrians. This, too,> sounded highly implausible – until this week in Richmond, British Columbia,> near the Vancouver airport, when I was startled as the lamppost in the> intersection started talking to me – in this case, instructing me on how to> cross (as though I were blind or partially sighted).Then there is ‘Voice Grid Nation’. This is a system brought to the US by theRussian Speech Technology Center (known as SpeechPro in America) which usesadvanced algorithms to match people to their voices and allow ‘police, federalagencies and other law enforcement personnel to build up a huge databasecontaining up to several million voices’. The system is claimed to scan tenthousand voices in five seconds and take only three seconds to analyse thespeech. It is essential to Agenda 21 to introduce monitoring and controltechnology that is activated away from public sight or access because they knowthat the time is coming when enough people will see what is going on for thereto be a significant response. Motorola, which has close connections to the USNational Security Agency (NSA), says that the future will bring ‘further accessand integration [again] into interagency and departmental databases will enablethe software to search crowds for suspects, guns or other dangerous items ...additionally, links to private sector video will be more commonplace, greatlyenhancing the quality of data and making it easier to act upon.’ Cut through theOrwellian language and this means that your data will be shared by governmentagencies and private corporations to form one gigantic global database. A USTreasury document seen by Reuters revealed plans to allow all American spyagencies access to all financial data of people banking in the country justifiedby the yawn, yawn, excuse of stopping terrorism and crime. DNA databases arebeing set up all over the place which they want to eventually connect as oneglobal DNA data centre. People have their DNA taken in Britain merely for beingarrested and it is kept on file even if they are not subsequently charged orconvicted with an offence. The Council for Responsible Genetics, a US non-profitorganisation, has revealed that 98 percent of the around 4.3 million Americanbabies born each year have a blood sample taken from their heels before they area week old. The same happens in the UK and it’s called the blood spot test or,in the United States, newborn bloodspots (NBS). The Council for ResponsibleGenetics said this can be stored in state databases without the parents’permission or even knowledge. The same will be happening in Britain andelsewhere even if the authorities deny it. Police in the United States are evensetting up roadblocks to ask drivers to ‘volunteer’ DNA swabs and blood samples.The Archon families are desperate for a global DNA database because it tellsthem who has the bloodline and who doesn’t and allows them to ascertain theprecise frequency on which individuals are broadcasting. This, in turn, allowsthem to be precisely targeted by energetic technologies for mind manipulation orassassination. The plan is also for a global Biometric Database which willretain photographs, fingerprints and iris scanning details of everyone. Hundredsof millions of Indian nationals have already had this done and been issued witha 12-digit number that can identify them wherever they go. One-time CIA DirectorDavid Petraeus, former head of the mass-killing operation in Afghanistan who wasbriefly reassigned as CIA chief in 2012, said they will be keeping surveillanceon people in their own homes via the televisions and ‘app-controlled gadgets’connected to your computers. All this control, surveillance and data compilationis absolutely in line with the Archon software mind. Everything must be in itsplace, everything recorded and carefully filed. An insider who had seen formerBritish Prime Minister Edward ‘black eyes’ Heath killing children told me how hewould write down their names by hand in a ledger and take their height andweight before murdering them. These people are computer programs and they wantto make humanity the same. Look around and you can see how successful they havebeen.Insiders tell it like it isThomas Andrews Drake, a former senior executive at the US National SecurityAgency (NSA), proves the point about how decent people are being driven out ofintelligence and law enforcement by the goonatics. Drake is a decorated veteranof the US Air Force and Navy, a computer software expert and linguist, andhighly-skilled in eavesdropping methods and technology. All was fine until hechose to expose the NSA’s illegal surveillance programmes and he was chargedunder the Espionage Act in an effort to shut him up. This is what they do, amongmany other things, to anyone on the inside that seeks to tell the truth aboutwhat is going on. Are you listening, all those in Intelligence, the military andlaw enforcement worldwide? And all of you in government administration at alllevels who are not part of this, but serve it anyway? You are just worthlesspawns to them, but while you serve them like good little slaves all will befine. Choose to do what is right for your family and the world in general,however, and suddenly it is not so fine. You need to summon some backbone likeThomas Drake and others and help us to bring this tyranny to an end or it willbe to your eternal regret. Drake lost his career, but the espionage charges wereeventually dropped when the goons ran out of ideas for how to make themcredible. He said that he spoke out after discovering systematic fraud and abusethat violated the US Constitution and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Actwhich he said should have been the first commandment at the NSA – you don’tviolate the privacy of Americans without a warrant. Drake said that he found tohis horror and shock shortly after 9/11 that the NSA had entered into anagreement with the White House to become executive agent of a secretsurveillance programme for vast reams of data collected through multiplesources. Among these potential sources is the proposed Cyber IntelligenceSharing and Protection Act (CISPA) which would legalise the sharing of Internetinformation between the US government and certain technology and manufacturingcompanies and give legal backing to what Google, Facebook and others are alreadycovertly doing. Thomas Drake said that under section 215 of the Patriot Actthere is a secret executive interpretation which ‘essentially grants thegovernment pretty much unfettered access to subscriber information that’s heldby those companies’. He said that CISPA ‘would take that to the next level’ andmore and more access would be demanded under the excuse of ‘cybersecurity’.Drake is such a high-level source from within the NSA that his views on what ishappening need urgently to be heard and acted upon:> I believe, if you take what has been happening since post 9/11 ... you are> seeing the establishment of a surveillance society. You are seeing the> establishment of the surveillance network and I keep telling people – people> don’t realise the extent to which we are already surveyed in many, many> different ways, the extent to which vast amounts of our own transactional data> in all forms, all electronic forms, emails, your tweets, bank records and> everything else are all subject, or suspect okay, in terms of surveillance ...> ... It raises the spectre of ... a universal wiretap – a persistent universal> wiretap on every single person. Or if not, they can create one – what happens> if they don’t like you? What happens if you seek ill will against the> government? What happens if you say something that they consider disloyal?> That’s not the country that I took an oath to defend four times in my> government career and you also have the fear element. Fear in itself is> control, and what people will do when they are fearful is ... begin to censor> themselves.> So much of what is happening now, particularly my case, [it sends] an> extraordinarily chilling message that anybody – and I was a Senior Executive> in the government, had a very high position at NSA – it sends an> extraordinarily chilling message that if you speak out ... we are going to> hammer you and we are going to hammer you hard because look what we did to Mr> Drake. Now security has effectively become the state religion. You don’t> question it and if you question it then your loyalty is questioned.I think they call it fascism, or communism, depending on the name you prefer foryour tyranny of choice. William Binney, another former NSA operative, said in asworn statement to the United States District Court for the Northern District ofCalifornia, that the NSA ‘has the capability to do individualized searches,similar to Google, for particular electronic communications in real time throughsuch criteria as target addresses, locations, countries and phone numbers, aswell as watch-listed names, keywords, and phrases in email’. He said the agencyis employing some 20 data intercept centres to store an ‘unimaginable’ quantityof information. ‘The sheer size of that capacity indicates that the NSA is notfiltering personal electronic communications such as email before storage butis, in fact, storing all that they are collecting.’ Of course it is. The lawmeans nothing to these people. They are the law. NSA insiders like EdwardSnowden have famously exposed the fantastic scale of survellience on thedomestic population and leaders and politicians of so-called ‘allies’ like thecountries of the EU. Everything is being logged, recorded and filedtechnologically. If anyone challenges the State’s actions in the courts the caseends up eventually with the Archon-controlled Supreme Court which delivers theverdict that the crazies demand – it’s okay to do whatever they like. Doesanyone think that the Archon networks would not own the Supreme Court given thatit is the final arbiter in the legal process? The Supreme Court is not primarilyjudicial, but political, and the last resort for laws and actions rejected byevery other level of the system. Control this and you know you will get your wayin the end. The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and eight associatejustices nominated by the US President and confirmed by the Senate. They thenhave the job for life unless they retire, resign or are removed throughimpeachment. Five of them who are making decisions on the legality of governmentwiretapping and other surveillance are at the time of writing members of theFederalist Society. Stephen Lendman at Globalresearch.org said of thisorganisation and its representatives on the Supreme Court:> They’re ideological extremists. FS began 30 years ago at Harvard, Yale and> University of Chicago law schools. Initially it was a student organization. It> challenges orthodox liberalism. It corrupts itself in the process.> It advocates rolling back civil liberties. It wants New Deal social policies> ended. It supports imperial wars, corporatism, and police state harshness. It> wants reproductive choice, government regulations, labor rights, and> environmental protections ended. It spurns justice in defense of privilege. It> defiles constitutional protections doing so.This is the mentality that sits as the final arbiter of what is lawful or legalin America. Anyone challenging the tyranny of the state will get a fair hearingfrom these characters then. Elena Kagan (Rothschild Zionist), another SupremeCourt Justice, has said that she loves the Federalist Society. Kagan is one ofthree Rothschild Zionists on the Supreme Court which is colossally out of allproportion to Jewish people being less than two percent of the Americanpopulation. But then what’s new? The Supreme Court decreed with a 5-4 majoritydecided on ‘ideological grounds’ that the public does not have a right tochallenge the government wiretapping of international phone calls and emailsafter the American Civil Liberties Union represented groups and individualsclaiming that the wiretapping violated the US Constitution by allowing themonitoring of international communications of people not suspected of criminalor terrorist activities. It was a decision that the Nazis and Stalinists wouldhave applauded. The system controls the people through law and money and so ofcourse the Archon networks must ensure they can dictate both. The Britishgovernment is having ever more cases conducted by secret courts so it cansuppress revelations about its state murder and systemic corruption. Thiscontrol of the law and government removes virtually all checks and balances onunfettered fascism and total surveillance.[../Images/00127.jpg]Figure 830: The microchips they let you see are small enough, but the real dealis well beyond human sight in the realms of nanotechnology.Chips with everythingI have been warning about the human microchipping programme for nearly 20 yearsand we are getting closer every day to mass microchipping. This is not only forsurveillance and tagging, but also to manipulate people mentally, emotionallyand ‘physically’ from a distance through a chip embedded under the skin.Assassination on tap is another bonus of the chip and also mass murder giventhat chips have been shown to cause cancer in animals and signals to the chipcan trigger a whole range of other health effects. We have a guy causing ustrouble? Okay, activate the chip-kill programme. People who are already killingpeople with drone attacks without evidence, charge or trial wouldn’t do that?They’d love it. Humans and computers are being connected through chips to allowpeople to use thought to communicate with technology. Well, you see typing andclicking a mouse is soooo tough. This is possible because they are connectingtwo computers, one biological and the other technological, but they arecomputers all the same. This means that microchips – and we are talkingnano-chips as well as those we see – can be used to dictate thoughts, emotionsand bodily responses from afar (Fig 830). Television companies can add an extrachannel to your ‘package’ in seconds simply by sending a signal to the microchipon the card in your receiver box. This is the same principle that they want toapply to humans under Agenda 21 when people will be treated as nothing more thanbiological robots and slaves. The chip is being introduced through theTotalitarian Tiptoe. The process began with the voluntary chipping of domesticanimals and this is moving incessantly towards the compulsory chipping ofanimals. We now have microchips in clothing and other products, all the chippedtechnology like mobile phones and also the get-them-used-to-it ‘electronictattoo’ for ‘medical purposes’ which is only one step from a human chip (Fig831). Motorola announced in May 2013 that it was investigating the possibilityof using the electronic tattoo as an alternative to traditional passwords ‘tomake logging into online sites, or accessing mobile phones, more secure’. Oh howthoughtful, but what a bloody lie. They are not ‘looking into it’ – the wholething is a long-planned Totalitarian Tiptoe to full on microchipping. Motorolaare also talking about having people swallow ‘authentication pills’. Well ifthey will swallow Obama as a man of the people they will swallow anything. Now,who is Motorola’s senior vice president of advance research who introduced theelectronic tattoo at the conference in California? Surely not? It can’t be ...it is: Regina Dugan, the former head of DARPA, the Pentagon’s technology anddevelopment arm, and an executive with Google. The game is so obvious. Anotherchipping-by-stealth technique can be seen with the devices for under skininsertion in the name of ‘monitoring health’ and predicting a heart attack withfear of death as its big selling point. The fact that it is highly likely togive you many health problems including cancer doesn’t get a mention. A nationalID card is another Tiptoe and as I write Obama and familiar names such as JohnMcCain, Lindsey Graham and Charles Schumer are pressing for an American ID cardthat would be essential to buy a travel ticket, vote, buy a gun and buy or sellanything. Their excuse is illegal immigration and as always ‘terrorism’. What asurprise that at the very same time the UK government was ‘consideringproposals’ to introduce an ‘entitlement card’ (ID card) to restrict free healthcare for immigrants. The crooks and criminals say that to introduce this policythose who are entitled to free treatment (virtually everyone though it’s notfree but taxpayer funded) will have to carry a card to prove they qualify. It isa backdoor ID card planned to be replaced by a microchip. Labour Party PrimeMinister Tony Blair tried and failed to introduce a national ID card and now hispolitical ‘opponent’ David Cameron of the Conservative Party wants to do thesame with Blair giving him public support. This is how it works in the one-partystate. There are already non-compulsory human chipping schemes available for‘security’ and ‘protection’ of children and people with dementia and the plan isto make this compulsory in the way that all the other invasions of human privacyhave eventually been. Six thousand people in Sweden have accepted a mark ontheir right hands in ‘trials’ for a cashless society and other ‘trials’ arespringing up more and more. Children in Texas and elsewhere are being preparedto accept chipping with a scheme allegedly designed to prevent truancy (escapefrom jail). They are fitted with satellite tracking devices that look like cellphones and appointed a designated ‘mentor’ with whom they must ‘check in’several times a day. This has been done with the permission of the parents(idiots) in the ‘trial’, but the plan is to make this universal and compulsory.We now have pills with tiny microchips which are activated by stomach fluids andsend a message to a receiver in a patch on the arm which decodes the data andtransmits information to a mobile phone to tell the person and/or their doctorthat the next dose is due. These are called Smart Pills. Even waste bins are nowbeing introduced which are chipped and can only be opened by personalidentification (eventually planned to be the human microchip). This is theTotalitarian Tiptoe to compulsory drugs to suppress thought, emotion andpersonality which are monitored technologically to ensure they have been taken.See the ‘we’re showing you what we plan to do’ movie, Equilibrium. I mentionedearlier how film producer Aaron Russo had been told by Nick Rockefeller before9/11 about the ‘giant hoax’ that was coming in the form of a war on terrorismand the search for Bin Laden and he also described the plans for microchipping‘the serfs’, as he called them, that would allow the El-lite to rule the world.Rockefeller constantly stressed that ‘the people have to be ruled’ and he saidthe population had to be reduced by at least half. Rockefeller told Russo thatif he joined them his chip would be coded to avoid unnecessary inspection. NickRockefeller is now based in China with another architect of Agenda 21, MauriceStrong. They deserve each other. These are the same Rockefellers that Bill andMelinda Gates are working so closely with on GMO in Africa and no doubt so muchelse.[../Images/00369.jpg]Figure 831: The electronic tattoo.[../Images/00044.jpg]Figure 832: Him again ... butter wouldn’t melt (it would freeze).Pre-crime craziesThe scale and speed with which control-technology is being introduced is nowextraordinary and this is possible because everything has been in place foryears waiting to be rolled out when the time was right and an excuse (they aregetting ever more feeble) could be found to justify these steps on the road tototal global tyranny. We now even have ‘Human Monitoring and Authenticationusing Biodynamic Indicators and Behavioural Analysis’(HUMABIO) which involvesinstalling ‘sensing seats’ fitted to trucks to record the driver’scharacteristic seated posture ‘in an attempt to spot whether commercial vehicleshad been hijacked’. We have facial recognition cameras; number plate-scanners,iris scanners; fingerprint scanners; ‘palm vein scanners’ for children to payfor school meals; full body radiation scanners; and also even intention-scanningthrough a technology known as FAST, or Future Attribute Screening Technology.This is claimed by US Homeland Security to monitor heart rate, tone of voice, aperson’s ‘gaze’, body temperature and other factors to identify those they sayare intending to commit a crime. The techniques include subjecting people to liedetectors. The FAST technology is mobile and can be used almost anywhere tointroduce the reality of ‘pre-crime’ which featured in the Tom Cruisepre-emptiveprogramming movie, Minority Report. I have been writing for yearsabout the technology being developed for decades to read people’s thoughts andso taking us into the realm of Orwell’s ‘thought-crime’. Lie detectors, whichare being ever more widely used despite major concerns about their accuracy, arepussy-footing around compared with what is planned. Michael Chertoff (RothschildZionist), the former head of US Homeland Security, was on the TV networksimmediately after the Batman movie shooting in Colorado to call for pre-crimescreening of people. This was the same Chertoff, son of a Mossad agent, who didthe same after the fake ‘underpants bomber terrorism’ to promote full-bodyscanners in airports – scanners manufactured by one his clients. Chertoff saidof pre-crime surveillance: ‘We need to understand more about the signs that showsomebody is either becoming deranged or becoming a terrorist, because there’s acommonality we see again and again.’ If this guy is searching for derangedpeople he only has to look in the mirror (Fig 832). The ‘commonality’ is theArchon bloodlines, Satanism/Saturnism and Rothschild Zionism. Some people havethe whole set as Chertoff well knows. Another aspect of the pre-crime scam isthe ‘evil gene’. Media reports said that scientists had been asked to study theDNA of ‘Sandy Hook killer’ Adam Lanza for abnormalities that could explain why‘he’ did what he is claimed to have done. The suggestion is that people with anyidentified ‘evil gene’ could be ‘treated’. The Transportation SecurityAdministration (TSA) has now added the pre-crime ‘chat-down’ to the pat-down andfull-body radiation scanners. This involves asking passengers ‘casual questions’like ‘Are you travelling alone?’ and ‘Where did you stay while you were here?’and then detect behaviour like a lack of eye contact or fidgeting that couldindicate that they are a possible terrorist or criminal. The TSA now has morethan 3,000 people ‘looking for suspicious people’ at airports. More than 30genuine TSA officers at Boston Logan Airport reported that this was being usedto target specific racial groups in an effort to arrest them for other thanterrorist offences. Tampa Police Department in Florida used the 2012 RepublicanNational Convention as the excuse to install dozens of behavior recognitionsurveillance cameras and they announced that the cameras would stay – and beadded to – after the Convention ended (see Britain and the Olympics). Thecameras are programmed to identify behaviour not considered ‘normal’ and reportthis to police monitors. DARPA has said that it wants to know what makes peopleviolent (it is obviously an internal inquiry) and then implant false stories intheir minds to evoke peaceful thoughts. The fact that they know that such accessto the human mind is possible shows how far we have come in the world thatOrwell predicted. A company called Veritas announced that it was developing a‘mind-reading helmet’ for use by the military, law enforcement and the courts.It is claimed to read brain activity to establish if someone is telling thetruth (Fig 833). Eric Elbot, CEO of Veritas, said the device could certainly bea ‘potential tool for evil’ and it would be extremely dangerous if only thegovernment had them. What does he think governments are going to do then –insist that they are shared around because it would dangerous if only they hadthem? And where is Elbot pitching this device first of all? Yes, of course – tothe military. ‘Oh no, it’s not our fault it is being used as a tool of thefascist state – we didn’t make it for that. We developed it to read granny’smind to see if she wanted sugar in her tea, honest we did.’ Researchers from theUniversities of Oxford, California and Geneva say they have found a way to hackthe human brain through a headset costing less than $300. A group of computerscience students were shown images while wearing the headset of banks, creditcard numbers, bank pins and maps and they didn’t know their brains were beinghacked for information. The study found that the students’ brains could behacked to glean personal information including their address, bank and even in20 percent of cases their pin number. The researchers said that hackers (theauthorities) could gain access to your thoughts by manipulating the headsetsoftware. ‘The development of new attacks can be achieved with relative ease andis only limited by the attacker’s own creativity,’ they said. Imagine what thecovert technology can do.[../Images/00041.jpg]Figure 833: What do I think? Ask this machine.British police at a cycling road race at the London Olympics in 2012 had theirown version of pre-crime screening. This was administered by a gatheringelite-section of the police known as the BBI or ‘Bunch of Bloody Idiots’. Theyarrested a spectator with Parkinson’s disease for ... get this ... not smiling.Mark Worsfold, a 54-year-old martial-arts coach, said he was sitting quietlyminding his own business when he was suddenly pulled from a seven foot wall,thrown to the floor and handcuffed by the goonatics of the BBI, or ‘SurreyPolice’. Worsfold watched the cyclists pass through the legs and feet of otherspectators while he was held on the floor. He said that Surrey police questionedhim about his demeanour and why he was not ‘visibly enjoying the event’. Theysaid that this ‘caused concern’ and they arrested him for a possible ‘breach ofthe peace’ when the guy could not have been more peaceful. He was held for hoursand his wife only found out what had happened when he did not turn up for hisdaughter’s birthday party and she reported him missing. Another goonatic traitis seeking to justify extraordinary stupidity and often brutality on theoccasions that it comes to public attention. Surrey police said that ‘the manwas positioned close to a small group of protesters and based on his manner, hisstate of dress and his proximity to the course, officers made an arrest toprevent a possible breach of the peace’. There you go – a pre-crime detected bythe pre-pubescent. The chief superintendent said that the attack on a man withParkinson’s disease for the crime of not visibly enjoying himself was done ‘inthe interests of public safety’ and his officers had acted ‘quickly anddecisively based on the information available to them’. Imagine what thismentality will be like with pre-crime technology like FAST. ‘He’s not eatingthat burger quickly enough, he must thinking about terrorism – send the boysin.’ I have an exclusive picture of the Surrey police involved in the attack onMr Worsfold with their chief superintendent on the phone urgently protecting theworld from terrorists (Fig 834).[../Images/00291.jpg]Figure 834: ‘He’s watching comedy and he’s not laughing?’It’s all a mind gameThe reality of these things happening, in the sense of them actually being doneto you, is less important in their scheme of things than your fear of them beingdone. The Taser is not there primarily to be used but to make people do whateverthey are told through the fear of them being used. This is why people dying fromTaser attacks and videos of how painful they are serve the interests of thetyranny. The whole thrust of all that I have been describing in the last twochapters is to make the population choose to comply and conform through fear ofnot doing so and eventually because they cannot summon a thought that would evenconsider not obeying perceived authority. They want compliant, unquestioningpeople with no sense of self or personal dignity. Full-body scanners thatproduce naked photographs of adults and children have many aspects to them andone is humiliation. This also applies to the intrusive ‘pat-down’ which isdesigned to undermine a person’s sense of dignity and control of their own bodyand space. I have had my bollocks felt many times after refusing the radiationscanners and I just laugh at them because to me they are just bollocks beingpatted by a system with bollocks where others have brains. But not everyone islike that. Most feel violated and that’s the idea. This is why system-serving USSupreme Court Justices gave jail staff the right to strip and search everyonearrested or jailed for even trivial offences for which they are not guilty.Albert Florence, an African-American businessman, was arrested by a New Jerseystate trooper goon on no suspicion of any offence except for a nonpayment of afine which had actually been paid; but The Nation reported that he was stillforced to ‘strip, shower with a delousing agent, open his mouth for inspection,hold out his arms and lift his genitals, and turn around so the officer couldexamine his buttocks’. He was held for six days without charge and transferredto Essex County jail where he was strip-searched again ‘required to squat andcough, and undergo close examination of his ears, nose, mouth, scalp, armpits,inner thighs and other parts of his body’. The next day a judge ordered hisimmediate release and said he was appalled by what had happened. Florence suedthe two counties and joined in a class-action by others who suffered the sametreatment. Among them were people who had been strip-searched after not wearinga seatbelt, having a noisy muffler, an inoperative headlight, a bald tyre,having lights on high beams and a faulty windshield wiper, ignoring a stop sign,improperly backing up, crossing a double line, parking in a no-parking zone,improperly riding a bicycle and riding without an audible bell. A 12-year-oldgirl was strip-searched after being arrested for eating fries in a Metro stationand it happened to a woman charged with failing to appear in traffic court whenthe judge had given her the wrong date. The Nation reported that a Chicago womandoctor ‘suffered paranoia, suicidal feelings and depression and would notundress anywhere but in a closet’ after being strip-searched. It is, of course,all utterly outrageous and disgusting and would never be allowed in a civilisedcountry in which people were respected. But it isn’t and they aren’t. This ismodern-day America and increasingly the modern-day world. The Archontic SupremeCourt rejected the Albert Florence suit despite all of the above. Why?Humiliation at every opportunity is demanded by the agenda and the Supreme Courtis owned by those behind the agenda. Simple, really. Bernard Harcourt, a lawprofessor at the University of Chicago, called the decision ‘frightening ... thekind of logic that can turn a democracy into a police state’. It already is apolice state and the ‘logic’ is ‘what decision did you say you wanted againmaster?’ British children held in custody have been strip-searched nearly 44,000times in under two years and illicit items were found in just 275 cases with nodrugs or weapons among them. Once again the bias was against kids from black andminority ethnic backgrounds and physical force was used on 50 occasions.Carolyne Willow, a former national co-ordinator for the Children’s RightsAlliance for England, secured the figures through the Freedom of InformationAct. She called the practice ‘institutionalised child abuse’ which it is, and ismeant to be.Another reason for the full-body scanners – and this applies to all theseimpositions and technology – is to monitor how much people will take beforeresisting. They push the edge and see what resistance they get. If there isnone, or not enough to cause a problem, they push on to even greater extremes.Right, chaps, we are going to see if people will accept themselves and theirchildren being irradiated every time they want to fly and we will give them analternative of having themselves and their children sexually abused. We’ll callit a ‘pat-down’ and we know that the job is going to attract a lot ofpaedophiles and perverts, but, heck, if they will take this they will takeanything. They stood for it? They did? Okay, roll them out everywhere, alltransport centres, sports stadiums, make a list. Now, next we tell them that wehave intelligence to suggest that terrorists intend to bypass the full-bodyscanners by implanting devices inside people. We’ll call them ‘belly bombs’,yeah nice and short and good alliteration. We issue a statement saying that‘full body scanners currently being used in airports would not penetrate deepenough to detect such devices’. We say that we have to give them a fullblownX-ray in the interests of public safety. The ‘belly-bomb’ insanity is not ajoke, by the way, well, in the sense that I meant it to be. This is what theyannounced in 2011. How long before you have to have an operation underanaesthetic to check you out before you board a plane? Another psychologicaltechnique is to make life so unpleasant and disruptive that people will be opento anything that apparently makes it better; but the ‘making it better’ involvesintroducing what the plan was all along. The system is now proposing tointegrate bag and people checks by having passengers walk through 21-foot-longtunnels with their bags and both will be irradiated with a combination of whatwas formerly used on bags and passengers. It would be terrible for your healthbut think of the time you’ll save waiting in line.The End GameTens of thousands of troops (and probably the rest) are preparing to policedomestic America and martial law is planned whenever they can orchestrate abig-enough fake attack on US soil. The military has even asked for companies tosubmit proposals for new head protection gear for use in domestic situations, or‘Homeland Security’. US Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T Odierno wants therepeal of Posse Comitatus, the Act that prevents most military law enforcementin domestic America. He wrote in Foreign Affairs, the Council on ForeignRelations magazine, that the army should be used to meet ‘challenges in theUnited States itself’ with regard to ‘domestic terrorism’. Better have somedomestic terrorism to justify it then, eh? Anyone know any mind-controlledpeople with guns? Odierno wrote: ‘Where appropriate we will also dedicateactive-duty forces, especially those with niche skills and equipment, to providecivilian officials with a robust set of reliable and rapid response options’. Iwrote those words ... ‘Better have some domestic terrorism to justify it then,eh? ... Anyone know any mindcontrolled people with guns?’... before the BostonMarathon bombings (see Postscript) and in the wake of that attack changes weremade to a regulation in the US Code ‘Defense Support of Civilian Law EnforcementAgencies’ which gave the military the right to patrol the streets withoutpermission from a local or state civilian authority. The regulation reads:> Federal military commanders have the authority, in extraordinary emergency> circumstances where prior authorization by the President is impossible and> duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the situation, to> engage temporarily in activities that are necessary to quell large-scale,> unexpected civil disturbances.This is another Totalitarian Tiptoe. Bruce Afran, a civil liberties attorney andconstitutional law professor at Rutgers University, said it was ‘a wanton powergrab by the military’ and ‘quite shocking ... because it violates thelong-standing presumption that the military is under civilian control’. That wasnever true, but they are not even paying lip-service to it now. I have includedin other books the list of undebated Presidential Executive Orders that allow inthe event of martial law for the takeover of all finance; energy sources;property; transport including private vehicles; communications; food productionand distribution; education; healthcare; where people and their families liveand work, including the right to split families and relocate entire populations;and anything else they choose to dictate. Executive Orders run in total to some200,000 words and others continue to be added. Obama signed a new ExecutiveOrder in July 2012, the Assignment of National Security and EmergencyPreparedness Communications Functions, which further increased the power of theArchon networks to take over all communications ‘under all circumstances toensure national security, effectively manage emergencies, and improve nationalresilience’. Obama signed the order on a Friday evening when the press had leftto avoid questioning and as much publicity as possible. No wonder when it giveshim and any future president the legal right to shut down all communicationsystems including the Internet. One report rightly said that he had givenhimself the right to impose total silence except for the sound of his own voice.The Order claims these rights in the event of an emergency to ensure‘survivable, resilient, enduring and effective communications so that thegovernment can speak to the people’. So why does this require the silencing ofall other communications at the same time? The answer is that this is anotherkey part of the preparation for martial law and the military takeover ofAmerica. The same will be in preparation in Europe and elsewhere. There areconcentration camps across American with watchtowers and fences with barbed wireangled to keep people in, not out. These are waiting for those considereddissidents who challenge the fascists, and are operated under the authority ofthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) which is a military operation intruth specifically established in readiness for the fascist takeover by theArchon bloodlines and their lackeys. The US National Guard began advertising in2009 for ‘Internment/Resettlement Specialists’ for ‘civilian internee camps’ inthe United States; KBR (formerly Kellogg Brown and Root) was awarded a contractin 2006 to construct detention centres for large numbers of people to beinterned; and KBR’s parent company, the truly disgusting Dick Cheney-connectedHalliburton, began seeking sub-contractors in 2011 to staff and equip ‘emergencyenvironment’ camps in five regions of the United States. I have alreadymentioned that hundreds of thousands of plastic coffins are stockpiled acrossthe United States. Congress passed a bill in 2012 requiring FEMA to prepare forthe disposal of ‘mass fatalities’. What do all these happenings and provisionsremind you of? The demands of Agenda 21. There are even Executive Orders (11647and 11490) that authorise the establishment of Federal Regional Councils togovern ten Federal Regions which will absorb the 50 states and another that cansteal your bank accounts if you are dubbed a ‘sanctioned person’ by thegovernment. ‘Sanctioned person’ – how Orwellian is that?

The manual was dated 2006 and was part of a training course atthe US Army Military Police School at Fort McClelland in Alabama. It describeshow during civil unrest or martial law the military will be used to break up‘unauthorized gatherings’ and patrol ‘the disturbance area to prevent thecommission of lawless acts’. This would include presenting a show of force,establishing roadblocks and dispersing crowds. The prisoners taken would beprocessed in internment camps. Another leaked military document, FM 3-39.40Internment and Resettlement Operations, says that those interned would be‘re-educated’ to give them ‘an appreciation of US policies’. Civil DisturbanceOperations makes it clear that a ‘warning shot will not be fired’ before themilitary open fire on rioters and ‘dissidents’ and says that ‘restrictions onthe sale, transfer, and possession of sensitive material such as gasoline,firearms, ammunition and explosives will help control forces in minimizingcertain forms of violence and that consideration may be given to evacuatingsensitive items, such as weapons from stores’. This is what the campaign todisarm Americans is really all about. The Washington Post reported in 2008 onplans to deploy 20,000 troops in domestic America in preparation for ‘terroristattack’ and civil unrest. The Archon families and networks know that the plan isto make the economic situation so appalling that people will respond en masseout of desperation. The US Army War College Strategic Institute predicted in2008 that a ‘strategic shock’ (a series of crises and upheavals) could triggerwidespread civil unrest (they know that this ‘strategic shock’ is planned) andthe military would be needed to suppress ‘purposeful domestic resistance’. Thesame preparations in the UK were revealed to me in 2008 and the information isbeing confirmed by events. This all makes sense of reports over the years thatBritish and American troops have been asked if they would shoot their own peoplein their own country and those who say they would do this are deployed to theseunits preparing for the domestic frontline. There have also been countlessreports over the last 20 years of foreign troops, including Russian and Chinese,training on American soil to be used against the American population on thebasis that they would be far more likely to kill Americans without a problemthan would many American troops. Nobel Peace Prize nominee Jim Garrow, who runsan organisation rescuing Chinese baby girls from death or ‘gendercide’, has saidthat he was told by ‘one of America’s foremost military heroes’ that the Obamaadministration’s criteria for selecting new military leaders is whether theywill obey an order to fire on American citizens. He said:[../Images/00102.jpg]Figure 836: God bless America.> I have just been informed by a former senior military leader that Obama is> using a new ‘litmus test’ in determining who will stay and who must go in his> military leaders. Get ready to explode folks. The new litmus test of> leadership in the military is if they will fire on US citizens or not. Those> who will not are being removed.The plan for the shooting of civilians by their own military has been leaked ina number of official documents over the years and can be seen in the ‘nohesitation’ targets supplied at a cost of millions of dollars to US HomelandSecurity by a company called Law Enforcement Training, Inc. These targets depictchildren, mothers, pregnant women and old people pointing guns for conditioningpractice for troops to have no hesitation on opening fire on such people. Howsick can you get? Oh plenty more than that. The term ‘domestic terrorist’ cameout of nowhere a few years ago and the focus turned to where ‘anti-terrorist’legislation was always intended be – the people at home. Occupy protestors andAmericans who in any way question the system are now designated as ‘domesticterrorists’ by these mind-controlled robots when the real terrorists are in darksuits and uniforms (Fig 836). A report by the Associated Press revealed that USmilitary police officers in units of 500 are being trained to ‘assist localauthorities’. The report said: ‘The battalions will be capable of helpingcontrol civil disturbances, handling detainees, carrying out forensic work, andusing biometrics to identify suspects.’ The plan was said to relate only tooverseas countries, but that is not where it is meant to end. President Obamasigned Executive Order 13603 entitled ‘National Defense Resources Preparedness’which allows the government to seize and take over all forms of energy, watersupply, healthcare, food and transportation through its many and variousagencies of tyranny ‘in support of the defence of the country’. Remember thatthe President of the United States can already order the murder of any Americancitizen that he chooses at home or overseas without the need to produce anyevidence or have any political or judicial oversight whatsoever, not that thiswould be much good anyway with the Archon-owned Congress and legal system.Americans can also be indefinitely jailed without charge or trial so long as thePresident signs the paperwork. They can, in the words of Dr Richard Day in 1969‘just disappear’. Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George WashingtonUniversity Law School, said:> President Obama has just stated a policy that he can have any American citizen> killed without any charge, without any review, except his own. If he’s> satisfied that you are a terrorist, he says that he can kill you anywhere in> the world including in the United States.> Two of his aides just ... reaffirmed they believe that American citizens can> be killed on the order of the President anywhere including the United States.> You’ve now got a president who says that he can kill you on his own> discretion. He can jail you indefinitely on his own discretion.Among those pressing for America to be designated ‘part of the battlefield’ andso have ‘anti-terrorism’ laws apply to Americans at home are the usual grotesqueRothschild-Zionist arse-lickers like Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain whoalways turn up when the agenda needs support along with others like RothschildZionists Joe Lieberman and Charles Schumer who are simply there to serve theinterests of Rothschild Zionism and Israel (the Rothschilds). Graham said ofanti-terrorism legislation: ‘The Homeland is part of the battlefield and peoplecan be held without trial whether an American citizen or not.’ These people haveno brains and no souls. The most basic freedoms, rights and protections of thepublic are being deleted by the excuse of ‘fighting terrorism’, but when was thelast time there was a major terrorist attack that was not covertly carried outby those who then used it to delete fundamental freedoms? This excludes 9/11,the London bombings of 2005, the shoe bomber, the underpants bomber and a longlist of others. Even with the few attacks that are by nongovernment terrorists,horrific as they are, relatively few people are involved. Is there still anyonewho can’t see that after all that I have described in the last few chapters andthe scale of the surveillance, control and imposition that this is nothing to dowith stopping terrorism and everything to do with enslaving the population? Iguess there will still be some who can’t see the blindingly obvious, or don’thave the guts to allow themselves to see; but they are close to lost causes now.If they can’t see what is happening after reading all this they will never seeit, well, until it goes bang, bang, bang on their front door and by then it willbe way too late for them and their families. Meanwhile, the bogus ‘war onterror’ has killed and maimed multiple millions around the world, especially inthe bloodline target regions of Africa and the Near and Middle East. This masshuman slaughter has been ordered and carried out by the very people who sayfreedoms must be surrendered in the name of stopping terrorism when they are thebiggest terrorists on earth. This is another blatant example of Archon inversionwhen the killer becomes the cop simply through image-making, repetition andpropaganda. This mass killing frenzy feeds the Archons the energy of trauma,terror and death and allows the world to move incessantly into Agenda 21.But don’t worry. I’m just crazy, right?"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00387.jpg]Archon PlanetI have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we mustapply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.Leonardo da VinciI am about to address what we can do about all of this, but I will complete thisvast and unprecedented exposure of the world and reality by briefly describingwhat human ‘life’ would be like if we continue to allow the few to impose theirevil upon the rest of us. It would neither be ‘human’ as we perceive human, norwould it be anything approaching what could be considered ‘life’.People would merely exist, not live, in jam-packed, high-rise tiny boxes inmegacities within the human settlement zones of the megaregions of Agenda 21.The population would be a fraction of what it is today and humans would bedenied access to 95 percent of the world’s surface. Everyone would bemicrochipped and connected to a computer system which would dictate theirthoughts, emotions and health, or lack of it. Surveillance would be 24/7 throughmicrochips, wireless systems like Smart Grids, Intellistreets and their like inevery building, location and form of transport within and between the megacities(Fig 837). Every thought could be accessed and recorded in real time. Peoplewould be watched in their own home by cameras in the compulsory television –Orwell’s Telescreens. The switchover from analogue to digital television isconnected to this which is why it is being done in such a rush and includes allaspects of broadcasting – even car radios at great expense to the targetpopulation. It has also brought us Smart televisions. This transfer to digitalhas freed the Ultra-High Frequencies, or UHF, where a connection can be made tothe subconscious mind. The US Department of Defense is employing a technologycalled Silent Sound Spread Spectrum, also known as S-quad, or Squad, andcorporately marketed under names such as BrainSpeak, Silent Subliminals andSSSS. Silent Sound Spread Spectrum involves planting inaudible subliminalprogramming into the subconscious mind within the Ultra-High Frequency range.The ‘silent’ in the name comes from the fact that humans cannot hear sound atthese frequencies and the messages speak to the subconscious without anyevidence perceivable by the conscious mind. These messages can be deliveredthrough digital television and radio and also via the Gwen networks, HAARP andother communication networks. This has the potential to send the same message toan entire country and eventually the whole planet once the delivery networks arein place. The world’s first fully-integrated ‘Smart City’ is due to beoperational by around 2015 on an artificial island in South Korea. The city isbeing dubbed ‘Songo’ and would include all that I have described and more withthe residents monitored second by second in their homes and businesses andthrough video screens. Major Archon corporations such as Cisco are involved andone of its planners said that it would connect ‘all of the residences, schools,offices, everywhere, all of the buildings’. Another said that when theinfrastructure is in place it would set the standard for all future cities andmore than 100 other ‘Songos’ are underway worldwide.[../Images/00258.jpg]Figure 837: The world the Archons and their hybrids are introducing by the hour.Food and water would be at the behest of the authorities on an Archon planet andonly given to those who conform and obey. Even then it would be only just enoughto allow them to function and serve. All food and drink would be infested withGMO, vaccines and chemicals to block thoughts of resistance and stop peopleawakening to Consciousness. Everything would be aimed, as it is today only farmore so, at maintaining humanity in a spiritual coma. We see this in China (ablueprint for Agenda 21 in so many ways) in the treatment of the advocates ofFalun Gong which promotes meditation, truthfulness, compassion and forbearancewith exercises to calm the body and open the heart. The practice of Falun Gongwas viciously and brutally suppressed after more than 70 million became involvedby 1999 (Fig 838). It was branded a ‘heretical organisation’ and anyonepracticing these spiritual processes suffers unspeakable physical andpsychological torture because the opening of the heart to the greater self isthe greatest threat to the prevailing order and they know it. What has happenedwith Falun Gong is how all spiritual practices will be dealt with under Agenda21 if it reaches its most extreme form and those New Agers who think they canjust hide away in their denial of the ‘negative conspiracy’ better understandthat eventually it will knock on their door if they don’t wake up and get theirfingers out – the ‘Greens’ too. Do they want to wait until then or deal with itnow? The lunatic levels of control-freakery can be seen with the Chinese (Agenda21) ban on reincarnating without government permission. The State Administrationfor Religious Affairs said that the law was ‘an important move toinstitutionalise management of reincarnation’. The idea is to dilute theinfluence of Tibet’s exiled spiritual and political leader, the Dalai Lama,whose soul is said to be reborn to continue his work. I don’t believe that butmany do and the Chinese ban on reincarnation without their permission is toallow them to choose the next Dalai Lama to serve their interests. These peopleare demented because they are expressions of the demented Demiurge. There wouldbe no organic food, no private growing of food of any kind, no alternativemethods of healing and no health supplements in an Archon society. Anyone whocares to look would see that we are heading in this direction so fast.Compulsory drugs would also make people love their servitude, as Aldous Huxleyput it, with substances like lithium in the water. Huxley said in 1962:[../Images/00117.jpg]Figure 838: Falun Gong – a warning to head-in-the-sand, head-in-the-clouds NewAgers.> There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of> making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears,> so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire> societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from> them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any> desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by> pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.By the time Agenda 21 reached complete fruition the water supply would be like astocktake at a pharmacy and this is what the current mass-drugging of thepopulation is all about. Compulsory vaccinations would include ‘chemicallobotomies’ which again prevent even the mildest of rebellion by making theBody-Mind incapable of having such thoughts. The 1971 movie THX 1138, thedirecting debut of deep insider and Star Wars creator, George Lucas, portrayedprecisely this situation and so did Equilibrium in still more predictiveprogramming preparing the human collective mind to accept its fate. An Internetsynopsis of the Lucas film describes it as depicting ‘a dystopian future inwhich the populace is controlled through android police officers and mandatoryuse of drugs that suppress emotion, including sexual desire’. Sound familiar?The word ‘dystopian’ could not be more apt given that it means ‘a society in arepressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian’. No onewould be allowed to know what is in their food and water and there would be nofood labelling. When you have Monsanto securing the right not to have to labelGMO-contaminated food in the United States you can see that we are alreadymoving in that direction. Surveillance drones would patrol the skies as they arenow beginning to do with the ability to locate and assassinate anyone by lockinginto their microchip frequency code. The military and police would be one entityand make today’s goonatics seem like cissies in the vicious way they impose thewill of the tiny few upon the enslaved majority (see Equilibrium). They would beable to do what they liked to people with no laws or enforcement to stop them.There would be no jury trials, only state-decreed ‘justice’ in what are called‘star chambers’ – the star is Saturn – which would be held in secret with nodefence, right of appeal, juries or witnesses. We are already moving along thatroad with more cases being held without juries and the law shredded at will byArchontic judges and those that control them. The appalling British governmentminister Kenneth Clarke, also a minister in the cesspit known as the Thatcheradministration, even said that all ‘right-thinking citizens of Middle England’should support secret courts when they were voted into law in 2013.Unbelievable; but then not so when you understand the mentality of these people.Clarke said that it was ‘common sense’ to allow courts to examine ‘intelligence’information in private when the real reason for secret courts is to hidegovernment corruption and collusion in criminality and state-sponsored murder.More and bigger prisons are also being built – exactly as Dr Richard Day saidthey would in 1969 and the burgeoning private prison system has been given anincentive to hold people for as long as possible. The more they incarcerate andthe longer they do so the more the prison operators are paid. They are also notsubject to the same oversight as State prisons, not that this means muchanymore, and there are currently more than 130,000 people in US private prisonswith the number growing very rapidly. Two and a half million people were held inAmerican prisons by 2012 – more than any other country, including China – andmore than half of those people are there for offences not involving violence.The figure represents a quarter of the world’s prison population when Americahas only five percent of the world population. The cost of this massincarceration is nearly $230 billion a year and the evil and fascistthree-strikes laws when people have been jailed for life for three felonies ofany kind has seen people imprisoned for life for stealing socks worth £2.50. Theexcellent Matt Taibbi, a proper journalist, wrote in Rolling Stone magazine:> Despite the passage in late 2012 of a new state ballot initiative that> prevents California from ever again giving out life sentences to anyone whose> ‘third strike’ is not a serious crime, thousands of people – the overwhelming> majority of them poor and nonwhite – remain imprisoned for a variety of> offenses so absurd that any list of the unluckiest offenders reads like a> macabre joke, a surrealistic comedy routine.> Have you heard the one about the guy who got life for stealing a slice of> pizza?

How about the guy who got life for possessing 0.14 grams of meth?> That last offender was a criminal mastermind by Three Strikes standards, as> many others have been sentenced to life for holding even smaller amounts of> drugs, including one poor sap who got the max for 0.09 grams of black-tar> heroin.This is the world of Agenda 21. People would exist, not ‘live’, in cashlesspoverty under Agenda 21 while the few that controlled them lived in unimaginablehigh-tech luxury in the Capitols, as per Hunger Games. Children would be ownedby the state and brought up in the way that Aldous Huxley foresaw from hisinsider knowledge in Brave New World. They would be technologically bred ingenetic caste systems and the idea of biological parents would be a page fromhistory, symbolically, that is, because history would be deleted. Huxley wrote:> In brief, parents were the father and mother ... These are unpleasant facts, I> know it. But then most historical facts are unpleasant ... In those days ...> children were brought up by their parents and not in State Conditioning> Centres.Huxley described how these State Conditioning Centres programmed children toaccept whatever the State decreed and anyone not conforming would beelectroshocked until they did. He described babies crawling towards pictures offlowers and birds only to be shocked because the State didn’t want them to likenature. Children in Brave New World are also brainwashed even when they sleepwith subliminal messages. Huxley said that eventually the child’s mind becomes,through psychological suggestion, the State’s mind:> ... at last the child’s mind is these suggestions, and the sum of the> suggestions is the child’s mind. And not the child’s mind only. The adult’s> mind too – all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides –> made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are our suggestions> ... Suggestions from the State.Let’s be honest, how many people are like that even today? The constant erosionof parental rights to make decisions about their children are stepping-stones tothe world that Huxley describes and Agenda 21 demands. As a transition tochildren being produced technologically by the state, parents would requirestate permission to have children according to strict genetic criteria. Therewould be no cars in this Archon world and the only transport would be local railtransit systems connecting homes and work places and high-speed trains betweenmegaregions. You would need permission to travel on the latter and even then youwould be sitting in carriages amid wireless mind control fields and watched bythe uniformed thugs of the State (Fig 839). People would work where they weretold to work with no choice. Indeed the word ‘choice’ would be deleted from thevocabulary along with others like freedom, just as Orwell envisaged from hisinside knowledge. We can see a glimpse of that emerging world of robotic mindsand robotic people with the experience of those who work at Amazon’s giantdistribution warehouses. An article published in the UK Financial Times andDaily Mail under the headline ‘Amazon’s Human Robots’ described how staff walkedup to 15 miles a day around a soulless warehouse with their every move dictatedby mini computers issuing orders and checking how hard they work. The articlesaid:[../Images/00141.jpg]Figure 839: What pillocks they look. You are fucking insane – can’t you seethat? Clearly not.> ... hundreds of people in orange vests are pushing trolleys around a space the> size of nine football pitches, glancing at the screens of their hand-held> satnav computers for directions on where to walk next and what to pick up when> they get there.> They do not dawdle — the devices in their hands are also measuring their> productivity.

Before> they can go home at the end of their eight-hour shift, or go to the canteen> for their 30-minute break, they must walk through a set of airport-style> security scanners to prove they are not stealing anything.’Is this the future of the British workplace?’ the article asked. Well, yes itis, but not only in Britain – everywhere. We are now seeing workers enslaved bymajor corporations including Amazon and others like the British royal family (ofcourse) through the use of ‘zero hours contracts’ in which people have to reportfor work, but without a guarantee of the hours they will be employed each day(if any) or the pay they will receive. It is outright ‘Hunger Games’ slavery,nothing less. Remember from earlier how the German ARD television channelalleged in a documentary that Rothschild Zionist Amazon was using neo-Naziguards to control and intimidate more than 5,000 temporary staff from acrossEurope at German packing and distribution centres? The programme showedoperatives from HESS Security (believed to be named after Adolf Hitler’s deputy,Rudolf Hess) wearing black uniforms, boots and military haircuts employed topolice the workers at hostels and budget hotels and this, too, is the world theArchons have in mind for everyone. There would also likely be Orwell’s perpetualwar to maintain human divide and rule and justify fascist controls with peoplecompulsorily drafted into military service. There would be no alternative media,no alternative views, just the incessant propaganda of the State. Any hugging orother shows of affection would be banned (as it is already in some schools runby programmed lunatics) and expressions of individual emotion or individualityin general would be suppressed by law, drugs and microchips. The chips and otherforms of perception control would allow people to be made individually andcollectively excited (to support a State proposal) or pacified (to stop anychallenge to the State).The techno-humanThe plan is to replace humans as we know them with a cyborg human that is partbiological and part technological. This would make people even easier tocontrol, lock them even more deeply into the five senses and bring an end to anyvestige of the spiritual, Conscious, human. This is the so-called ‘post-humanrace’ that is being developed as slaves in the world of Agenda 21 which are ableto survive a much more irradiated atmosphere. This is a crucial aspect of Agenda21 and we have been bombarded with programming and symbolism on this subjectthrough movies such as the Terminator series with the already cyborg ArnoldSchwarzenegger and a long list of other films, television programmes, musicvideos, computer games, children’s books and toys, and stage performances (Fig840). There is a massive attempt to program people to accept this because it isso important to the plan. Mad professors at Harvard have even developed a‘cyborg skin’ (‘Smart Skin’) which meshes electronics with biological tissue,and organisations like Google are developing artificial brain technology thatcan learn and act without any human input. This is just the kind of power youshould give to machines over which eventually you will have no power, but thatis what the Archons want – a machine-controlled world, matching their ownmachine-like nature, and controlling machine-infiltrated humans. This is thereal reason for the Archontic transhumanist movement which is campaigning forhumans to be merged with technology. This would allow the machines to far moreeasily control part-machine humanity. DARPA has openly said that it is seekingto genetically and technologically ‘enhance’ troops (create fighting sub-humanrobots with no compassion, empathy or ability for free thought). This satanicorganisation is also funding a range of research programmes in the field of whatis termed ‘transhumanism’. The prefix ‘trans’ is usually taken to mean ‘across’,as in the Trans-Siberian railway; its Latin meaning is, yes, ‘across’, but also‘beyond’ and ‘on the opposite side’. I think that captures the truth behindtranshumanism perfectly. It means beyond human and on the opposite side tohuman. The UK Daily Mail reported in August 2012:[../Images/00271.jpg]Figure 840: Arnold Schwarzenegger on the right with mask on the left.> Tomorrow’s soldiers could be able to run at Olympic speeds and will be able to> go for days without food or sleep, if new research into gene manipulation is> successful.

The plans were revealed by> novelist Simon Conway, who was granted behind-the- scenes access to the> Pentagon’s high-tech Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency.Recruits to the DARPA world army would be specially bred for size and inabilityto think beyond responding to orders – human-machine cyborgs. I have no doubtthat these breeding programmes have already begun and the technology softwaresoldiers and a robot army of cyborgs and machines is certainly well underway andbeing produced (Figs 841 and 842). Put ‘DARPA robot army’ into a search engineand you’ll see how far this has gone. DARPA actually wants to createfully-fledged robot armies and one of its major partners is Boston Dynamics Incwhich has been contracted to produce humanoid robots with ‘two legs, a torso,two arms with hands, a sensor head and on board computing’ that can actintelligently without supervision to ‘conduct humanitarian, disaster relief andrelated operations’. Oh please. DARPA and the Pentagon don’t.do humanitarianrelief – they are more concerned with causing the devastation which thenrequires humanitarian relief. The deal is to produce a robot military that willalways follow orders and be both part-human and completely technological. DARPAhas already awarded contracts for robots that could search and detain‘uncooperative people’. The Pentagon said that its new robots would be able touse hand tools and drive vehicles. Put the words ‘Petman Tests Camo’ intoYouTube and see what they are now even putting on public display. The world ofthe Matrix movie series was controlled by machines which had developed a form ofintelligence and taken over from humans and we are seeing the emergence of thesame theme with the number of industrial and service robots within human societyabsolutely exploding by the year. If some way could be found to connect them toa sort of hive control system they could indeed take over under the dictates ofthe Archons who are, when compared with the true human, a form of energeticmachine. It so happens that DARPA-funded research has developed a techniquecalled ‘mind-meld’ which can connect brains into one multiple-functioning unitand transfer thoughts and perceptions between them. This also has the potentialto be downloaded into robot technology to give them artificial intelligence andthe US military is already talking of these robots being given the ability tomake their own decisions about who to kill and when. The whole thrust of wherethey are going is to allow them to wage war on humanity from a distance – theirunderground facilities and bases within mountains – and this is the reason fordrones and the robot armies. They would not reappear until humanity was defeatedand humans were tagged to be located anywhere and anytime and killed from afarby technology that seeks out their frequency. What chance will we have then?This is why we must respond en masse now in the little time we have before theline is finally crossed. Advocates of transhumanism want to see technological‘enhancements’ to human capabilities including super-human strength and mentalcapacities via technology (part-human-part-machine) and nanotechnology, drugsand genetic tinkering. The idea is to lock people into the Matrix morepowerfully than ever. The American physicist Michio Kaku has also been pushingthis transhumanist crap about merging people with machines on US television withyoung people as the target. We have even had Dr. Sergio Canavero of Italy’s‘Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group’ announce that they are on the verge ofbeing able to transplant a human head to create a ‘chimera’ (something made fromdifferent genetic tissue), an Archontic speciality. Where are the clowns whenyou need them? Oh, too busy announcing they can transplant a human head, gotcha.One aspect of transhumanism is ... ladies and gentlemen, I give you ...‘paradise engineering’. This can be translated more accurately as ‘love yourservitude’. Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics at Britain’s University ofReading, said: ‘If a machine is passing down signals that keep you completelyhappy, then why not be part of the Matrix?’ Warwick has made numerousappearances in the media after being microchipped and he promotes this and othertranshumanist ambitions as the means for human progress (Fig 843). If Warwick isan example, I will give it a miss, thanks. One of the names for this paradiseengineering is ‘abolitionism’ which is ironic in itself. The term was used forthe movement dedicated to abolishing slavery and here it is being employed todescribe a far greater slavery – the enslavement of mind and emotion within atechnologicallyengineered reality. British ‘philosopher’ David Pearce, one ofthe most prominent transhumanists, established the Abolitionist Society in 2002with Pablo Stafforini, Sean Henderson, and Jaime Savage, and also the WorldTranshumanist Association with ‘Oxford philosopher’ Nick Bostrom who otherwisetalks a lot of sense about the simulated nature of our reality. Whether theyknow what they are doing or are just naïve to the real outcome is open topersonal view. Pearce says of his vision:[../Images/00172.jpg]Figure 841: The robotarmy in production.[../Images/00250.jpg]Figure 842: ‘I’ve picked up his microchip ... behind the tree to the left.’> The metabolic pathways of pain and malaise evolved because they served the> fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment. They will be replaced by a> different sort of neural architecture – a motivational system based on> heritable gradients of bliss. States of sublime well-being are destined to> become the genetically pre- programmed norm of mental health.[../Images/00401.jpg]Figure 843: A microchip holding Kevin Warwick.Well, what a minefield in only three sentences. ‘Heritable gradients of bliss’and ‘states of sublime well-being’ to become the ‘genetically pre-programmednorm of mental health’. Like I say, love your servitude. These academic andphilosopher types can’t resist the jargon because they think it makes them soundclever. Well, it doesn’t from where I’m sitting. Heritable simply meanssomething that can be passed on from one generation to the next. So we aretalking genetically-programmed adoration of servitude. It reminds me of theexperiment by a CIA head-case called Ivor Browning. I don’t care if he’s got aBrowning or any other colour, personally. Is he one of the Gravy-Brownings?Anyway, what matters to me is that he wired a radio receiver to the pleasurecentre in the brain of a donkey and took complete control of the donkey’sbehaviour by stimulating, or not, the pleasure centre known as the hypothalamus.Browning made the donkey walk up a mountain and back again simply by stimulatingpleasure when it went in the desired direction and switching it off if itdeviated. The donkey was then immediately seeking the right course to make the‘pleasure’ kick in again. What is called pleasure can be a potent tool ofbehaviour modification and control, in fact one of the most powerful. Resistingthe addiction to simulated ‘pleasure’ in such circumstances is crucial topersonal freedom. These transhumanist, subhumanist chaps want to geneticallypre-program states of sublime well-being which is much the same as Browning didwith his donkey. Researchers at Brown University in the United States announcedin 2013 that they had created ‘the first wireless, implantable, rechargeable,long-term brain-computer interface’. They had been implanted into pigs andmonkeys and human ‘trials’ were about to start, but you can be sure thattechnology far in advance of this already exists in the secret projects aimed atmerging people and machines – people and Archons. This is the reality of what ishappening. Archon genetic engineering was designed to re-make humans asbiological robots and now this is the next stage to complete the transformationto full-blown technological robots hiding behind the cover story of human‘enhancement’, longevity (longer servitude), and disease-free ‘pleasure’. Who isgoing to control this programming? Who is going to control how it can be turnedon and off like Browning’s contraption? Yep, you got it.The World Wide MindAmong the other wants and desires of Archontic transhumanism are designerbabies; introducing the DNA of other species to create a transgenic(genetically-modified or GMO) human; and a brain-computer interface (alreadybeing developed) in which the human mind can be plugged into the Internet tosurf (serf), download, upload and merge into a hive-mind with the World Wide Weband all minds attached to it (Fig 844). Technologies such as Google Glass, anInternet-connectable computer that can be worn like spectacles, arestepping-stones to direct microchipped interconnection. One app producer claimedthat he could make it possible for pictures to be taken with Google Glass justby blinking and it also has the potential to operate as a face-recognitiondevice. Google Glass came from the Google X technology development arm, and nodoubt former DARPA director Regina Dugan to become a senior executive withGoogle will be very much involved in what her company produces. Google is thepredominant player in the transhumanist agenda and technology like Google Now isdesigned to track and manage every aspect of people’s lives with the ability toknow if you are walking, driving, or riding a bicycle, when you are at home andable to recognise your voice patterns which are an expression of your uniquevibrational signature. These stepping-stones are promoted as an ‘ain’t itgreat?’ new gadget when they are systematically taking people down a dark anddangerous road. The modern Pied Piper has ditched the pipe for a smartphone.Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt (Rothschild Zionist) said in 2013 thatthe company could produce artificial intelligence within five to ten years thatwould be indistinguishable from the human mind (the enslaved human mind thatis). Schmidt is obsessed with the transhumanist agenda and has describedconcepts like sending a robotic clone of himself to social events and swallowingnanotechnology to regulate his body. His desire for a society run by robots andtranshumanist technology is shared by so-called futurists such as Ray Kurzweil(Rothschild Zionist) who wants to see humans merged with machines and haveglobal society controlled by computer systems with an artificial intelligencethat surpasses that of the entire human race (the enslaved minds of the humanrace). Kurzweil is the director of engineering at ... Google. One of his tasksthere is to oversee the development of an artificial brain and I’m sure thatDARPA’s Regina Dugan is delighted to have him on board. We are now getting closeto the major reason why the Internet was created using military technology. Ifit didn’t suit the interests of the Archon bloodlines this would not havehappened. I have been saying for years that the World Wide Web was beingdeveloped as a technological collective mind and now they are talking aboutthat. I have also heard the question asked: Could the Internet ‘wake up’? Couldit reach a point where it transforms into a global technological mind thatbegins to dictate to humans rather than the other way around by transforminginto a form of technological consciousness? The answer to that is most certainly‘yes’ and I am sure that is the Archontic plan. Not only a plan either – it isalready happening as the Internet covertly re-wires the brain. NeuroscientistChristof Koch says that the complexity of the World Wide Web may have alreadysurpassed that of the human brain. He writes in his book, Consciousness:Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist:[../Images/00237.jpg]Figure 844: The Internet is planned to be an artificial collective mind.> Take the number of computers on the planet – several billion – and multiply by> the number of transistors in each machine – hundreds of millions – and you get> about a billion billion, written more elegantly as 10^18. That’s a thousand> times larger than the number of synapses in the human brain (about 10^15).This is again the scenario symbolised in the Matrix movies of machines takingover the world. To a large extent the Internet is already ‘awakening’ in someform of collective technolgical intelligence, or ‘AI’, and not just theInternet, either, but also the connected and associated communication andsurvellience systems in all their now endless forms. Once they reach the stagewhen they are communicating with each other as one global technological mindwhere does that leave humans then? In the world of The Matrix, that’s where. Thecorporations will claim ownership and copyright of the human bodies theygenetically-engineer or ‘enhance’ just as they do today withgenetically-engineered crops and animals. You want to plant patented seeds? Geta licence from Monsanto and pay a royalty. You want to have children? Get alicence from Monsanto or someone else and pay a royalty (until they are producedin laboratories). How much of this genetic engineering and microchipping isalready happening through consuming GMO food and breathing in nanoparticles fromchemtrails, etc., etc.? How much nanotechnology has already been insertedthrough vaccination programmes? A CIA scientist told me in 1997 that microchipswere even then already so small (’nanotechnology’ as we know it today) that theywere implanted with hypodermic needles during vaccinations. Transhumanists givethe impression that they are talking about technologically ‘upgrading’ all ofhumanity, but that is not the game at all. Those in the shadows want onlycertain genetic types ‘upgraded’ and the rest only to suffer the control aspectsof transhumanism rather than the super-strength, super-intelligence stuff theytalk about. Why would an El-ite that wants to have total power over the humanmasses give them ‘super strength and super intelligence’? Nor is it acoincidence that the first person to use the term transhumanism was theeugenicist Julian Huxley, brother of Aldous Huxley, or that transhumanism waslaunched in the 1950s by Julian Huxley and the Rockefeller Foundation. Huxleyonce said:> The lowest strata are reproducing too fast. Therefore ... they must not have> too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last> check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced> or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization.Now we are at the core of what transhumanism is really about – eugenics. This issuch a common theme with these people because like their Archon masters they areobsessed with genetics, both their own and those of the target population.Transhumanism calls its plan for human-technology hybrids the ‘singularity’ andpromises immortality and disease-free life. They are so comatose that they don’trealise that we already have immortality – it’s called Consciousness andAwareness. Another chap, Matthew Liao, an associate professor in the Centre forBioethics in the Department of Philosophy at New York University, wants to seehumans re-wired to stop humancaused climate change which isn’t happening. Amonghis ‘human engineering’ proposals are to use drugs to make peoplemeat-intolerant to drastically reduce the number of methane-farting cows thatare claimed to be a danger to the world; manipulating hormones and ‘screening’embryos to create smaller people (which will reduce the weight that cars have tocarry and so use less fuel); and using drugs to change personality; but none ofthese are even his most bizarre idea. Mr Liao, I give you the floor:> Human engineering could also be liberty enhancing. In response to climate> change, some people have proposed we adopt something akin to China’s one-child> policy. For example, a group of doctors in Britain has advocated a two-child> maximum. But suppose that the relevant issue is some kind of fixed allocation> of greenhouse gas emissions for each family.> If so, given fixed allocations of greenhouse gas emissions, human engineering> could give families the choice between having one large child, two> medium-sized children or three small children. Human engineering seems more> liberty enhancing than a policy that says you can have only one or two> children.Did I mention that the inmates have taken over the asylum? I must have done atsome point given all the evidence that I have presented. These are the peopledirecting and influencing our world. Takes deep breath, checks own sanity (no,it’s not me) ... What I have described in detailing the Archon agenda certainlyisn’t pretty, but as Morpheus said in the Matrix: ‘... all I am offering is thetruth ...’ and not what people would like to be the truth. If we don’tunderstand what is going on and what the game is then the plan will inevitablyplay out. Most of what I have described in the Archon society is clearly statedin Agenda 21 documents while some is unstated (but possible to research andobserve) to hide the truth from the Green fanatics and ill-informed public‘servants’ lower down the food chain whose families will be entrapped in theAgenda 21 nightmare like everyone else. It does not have to happen, but it willnot go away by us looking away. There is only temporary and illusory solace inbuckets of sand, or even whole deserts of it, because if we don’t face it nowwhen we still just have a chance, we will have to face it down the line when achallenge will be near-impossible. This is the world we are currently headingtowards. How do I know? Look around and you will see that the world is changingin precisely the form envisaged by Agenda 21 documents. If we do not have theguts, balls and unshakable commitment to put an end to what is planned then weare condemning ourselves and our children and grandchildren to experience it.Come on, we’re bigger than that."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00342.jpg]A World Without BollocksI love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress,and grow brave by reflection. ‘Tis the business of little minds to shrink, butthey whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, willpursue their principles unto death.Leonardo da VinciWhere do we go from here? Well, here are some of the quotes that I have beenusing of Leonardo da Vinci from more than 500 years ago: ‘You can have nodominion greater or less than over yourself’; ‘All our knowledge has its originsin our perceptions’; ‘You do ill if you praise, but worse if you censure, whatyou do not understand’; and ‘Learn to see. Realise that everything connects toeverything else.’This is the wisdom that will lead us out of the current abyss and bring an endto this Archontic silliness.Da Vinci also said: ‘Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication’; ‘Where thespirit does not work with the hand, there is no art’; ‘Where there is shouting,there is no true knowledge’ ‘The greatest deception men suffer is from their ownopinions’; ‘Blinding ignorance does mislead us. O! Wretched mortals, open youreyes!’From this expanded perspective all answers will come.We do not need solutions to the ills of the world. We need to remove the causeof the problem and that is ignorance and arrogance. These are inseparablepartners in the war on human awareness and innate intelligence. The stupidity ofignorance can only survive through the blindness of arrogance. They need eachother for their mutual prosperity (Figs 845 and 846). You see this withjournalists who dismiss any idea of a global conspiracy because (a) they areignorant of what is really happening in the world and (b) they are arrogantenough to believe that because they are ‘journalists’ they would know about itif it were true. I guess you could throw terminal naïvety into the mix also. Awonderful example came when Alice Walker, the brilliant American author, poetand activist, said some nice things about my work in 2013. Alice is the authorof the acclaimed The Color Purple, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction,and has lived an extraordinary life, battled against incredible odds and been amajor voice in the civil rights movement. She is a highly intelligent,insightful and gutsy woman who has earned the respect of everyone who knows herstory. But when she appeared on the BBC radio programme, Desert Island Discs, toselect the music that she would take to a mythical desert island, she suddenlybecame ‘weird’ and ‘bizarre’. The cause of this perceived shapeshift in thebewildered minds of the chattering classes was that the book she said she wouldtake to the island was Human Race Get off Your Knees. She chose a book by DavidIcke? What? The ‘Independent’ newspaper in London was immediately on the case:[../Images/00089.jpg]Figure 845: The human disease.[../Images/00254.jpg]Figure 846: Quite ...> Ms Walker may have won a Pulitzer Prize. Her best-known novel – The Color> Purple – may grace school syllabuses across the English-speaking world. But> such heights of achievement are, it seems, no guarantee of sense.Another ’Independent’ article by an alleged ‘journalist’ called Liam O’Brientook the same line against Alice Walker because she had committed the deadliestof sins to the arrogant and ignorant mind. She had gone beyond the walls of itsprogrammed myopia and, as an icon of the intellectual ‘left’, she had betrayedtheir cause and their selfperception (deception) of intellectual omnipotence.The Independent, like the UK Guardian, promotes itself as the voice of theintellectual left when they are both merely another cul-de-sac for the mind. TheIndependent is ‘independently’ dependent on The System for its perceptions andopinions just like all the rest. As Morpheus says in The Matrix: ‘You have tounderstand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged ... and many ofthem are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fightto protect it.’ It wasn’t only ‘journalists’ who responded this way to AliceWalker. Social media was awash with ‘What the fuck?’ These are a few typicalcomments: ‘Oh my god: Alice Walker just chose a David Icke book for her desertisland. 45 minutes of sensitivity and emotion overthrown in one sentence’; ‘Theysay you should never meet your heroes (you’ll be disappointed). You should alsonot listen to their Desert Island Discs, Alice Walker’; ‘Alice Walker thinksthat David Icke is like Malcolm X? What? I mean...what??’; ‘It’s not a spoof ora hijacked website?? Alice Walker really compares David Icke to Malcolm X???’And so it went on. If ever there was a microcosm of a macrocosm this was it. Theminds of these people have been hog-tied by the Matrix while believing they arerunning free in the Serengeti. They have confused firewalled perception andprogrammed myopia with freedom of thought. ‘I do have an open mind – so long aspeople say what I agree with.’ It is rightly said that everyone has a right totheir opinion and I could not agree more; but that does not mean that opinionsdeserve equal respect if they are based on no research whatsoever and are formedonly from the repetition of immovable belief. Alice Walker was a hero to thismentality until she stepped beyond its comfort zone (program). Two words wereall it took – David Icke – and instant dismissal and outrage followed. This wasnot even triggered from reading my books, but from reading their software withits long-downloaded ‘David Icke is a nutter’. ‘I do have an open mind – so longas my software agrees with what I think.’ This social media posting was justclassic: ‘Oh my god: Alice Walker just chose a David Icke book for her desertisland. 45 minutes of sensitivity and emotion overthrown in one sentence.’ Thesource had actually revealed the reason for the human plight in two sentences.Alice Walker took the trouble of reading a book before making her conclusions –that is how freedom of thought actually works, strangely enough. Why don’t theLiam O’Briens of the media and social media (the overwhelming majority) putaside their ignorance and arrogance long enough to find a touch, even a smear,of humility and inquisitive open-mindedness sufficient to ask the simple andobvious question: why would a highly intelligent woman like Alice Walker saysuch things? But that would mean walking headlong into extreme and unexploreddanger ... the danger that their belief systems might have to be reassessed.This is their worst nightmare – change the subject before I have to take to mybed (Fig 847). There is a saying which goes: ‘The one who follows the crowd willusually go no further than the crowd ... [but] ... those who walk alone arelikely to find themselves in places where no one has ever been before.’Following the crowd is how we got up this creek with the paddle missing and toremove the cause of the problem we need a mass awakening of Mind toConsciousness, limitation to All Possibility and software to everywhere. Thereare no limits to possibility, only to a sense of the possible. And we imposethat upon ourselves – thus we can also set ourselves free of such debilitatingrestriction. Da Vinci said: ‘The greatest deception men suffer is from their ownopinions.’ Yes and what are opinions? They are only the result of personalbackground, prejudice and access to perceived knowledge, and yet they seamlesslymorph into solidified ‘fact’. Most of science and almost all public perceptionof ‘fact’ is little more than opinion and assumption repeated into generalacceptance. There is no way we can head off what is Archontically-planned forhumanity unless the blinkers of belief are cast aside and the power ofinformation and insight dictates our sense of reality instead of programmedperception. We can’t change the world until we change ourselves because theworld is a collective expression of the human totality. You can have all theprotest marches and demonstrations that you like, but without an expansion ofawareness we will stay on the hamster wheel made possible only by programmedignorance.[../Images/00014.jpg]Figure 847: ‘The truth? Aaahhhhh ... get it out of here.’Twigs and ForestsI refer to what I call Twig People and Forest People. The vast majority arecurrently Twig People and the few – though fast growing in number – are ForestPeople. By that I mean this: Twig People are the victims of their own myopia andcannot see beyond their race, culture, religion, job, political preference,sexuality and societal programming. Forest People see all this as an irrelevantdiversion from the big picture of global control and abuse of all races,cultures, religions, jobs, political preferences, sexualities and societalprograms. They also see it as a diversion from the even greater truth that weare all ONE Awareness having different experiences for the biblicalthreescore-years-and-ten. This is Da Vinci’s point that humanity must learn tosee and realise that everything connects to everything else. To the Twig Peopletheir twigs are the only truth and the forest is a heresy. The forest isdangerous to all authority because by definition it means that people areconnecting the dots – the twigs – and seeing what they really are when connectedtogether. Once that picture comes into focus all aspects of authority and thebelief systems on which it stands come crashing down in an explosion oflife-changing insight. If you are a cog, but see yourself and the other cogs asindividuals doing your own thing, you will never see what is really going on.But once you see the machine then your perception is immediately transformed andthe true nature of your daily existence becomes blindingly obvious.‘Hey, we’re just cogs in the same machine.’‘Oh shut up, have you been on the oil again?’Cog and machine is only a different analogy for twig and forest – sheep andflock is another (Fig 848). I had an interesting chat when I was completing thisbook with my friend Mike Lambert about the known against the unknown. Society isdominated by a belief in the known. Education, science, medicine, politics andmedia are all founded on a belief in the known. The known is basically theholographic realm of what is called the physical world and the unknown is theunseen infinity of waveform information and pure consciousness from which theholographic illusion is decoded and made manifest. The known is the domain ofthe five senses – can I see it, hear it, touch it, taste it or smell it? Thesequestions therefore become the arbiters of perceived existence or non-existence.Education is about teaching the known to the next generation of programmed‘knowers’ while academics, scientists and doctors are looked upon in awe becausethey are perceived to know more than others about the known. But what is this‘known’?. It is what they believe is known, what they have been told is knownand nothing more. It was known that the Earth was flat and this ‘known’ waspreached and imposed upon generations galore in the great centres of alleged‘education’; but it was wrong all the same. The known is only ‘I believe it isknown’ but it is the very foundation of human society. Universities across theworld are acclaimed places of ‘learning’ but they are only teaching the known –the believed to be known – and, as Mike Lambert said, you can only truly learnby uncovering the unknown. Everything else is repeating. When your job, statusand even sense of self and security come from the known there is a built-inincentive to ignore or trash the unknown. The known fears the unknown as thetwigs fear the forest because the more the unknown reveals its secrets the morethe known loses its omnipotence and dominance of perception (Fig 849). How funnythis is when what is perceived as the known is only a decoded figment of theunknown’s imagination. The dream is the dreamer but can only see the dream. Theknown is the unknown but can only see the known. This ‘known’, the holographicillusion, is where people invent and worship their twigs while the realms ofwaveform and pure Consciousness are the forest that connects everything as One.The Control System demands for its very survival that the twig mentality beconstantly maintained and so ‘visionaries’ have always been sought out andtargeted by the authorities of the day. True visionaries are Forest People andso immensely threatening to the prevailing order which needs to lasso humanperception and tie it to the hologram. Most of even the alternative media can’tsee the forest for the twigs because on one side it takes the Bible as itsdictator of truth and possibility and on the other its Bible is mainstream‘science’. There is a growing alternative to the alternative which can seebeyond both, but still those perception systems dominate at present. I amdismissed by both of them because I challenge religion and science, which islittle more than another religion anyway – with honourable exceptions. I am finewith that because they are manifestations of the known, or the perception of theknown, and I want to explore way beyond that. If dismissal and ridicule by TwigPeople is a consequence then it’s well worth it and I don’t care what they sayabout me anyway (Fig 850).[../Images/00082.jpg]Figure 848: Replace the sheep with humans and it would be just the same.[../Images/00321.jpg]Figure 849: The maze knows best. The viewing deck is a heretic.Redefining ‘Normal’You can see the twig and forest deal in politics, too. The political twig ispower – or perceived power – and not what is most beneficial to the population(forest). This makes the battle for power and winning elections the focus ofvirtually all that happens in politics. Far from coming together to agree whatis best for the people they are supposed to represent, the goal is to underminetheir political opponents in every way possible so that they win or hang on to‘power’. This happens the world over as they argue over who holds the twig whilethe forest burns to oblivion. Politics and governments are also founded on abelief only in the perceived known. Decisions are made about ‘health’ care onthe basis that Big Pharma medicine is the only credible source of knowledge andthe same with mainstream ‘science’. The Big Pharma twigs are money and monopolyand so the interests of the patients (forest) are sacrificed (literally) to theinterests of the Archontic ‘gods’. The education system which underpins thewhole twig mentality is coming from the same direction. Another serious andhighly destructive ‘twig’ is an obsession with me, me, me. You see this withpoliticians, but in the wider sense this twig is self-interest, self-obsession,resentment and jealousy and the forest is the greater good. So many times I haveheard people say how much they support my work until there is something theywant or don’t like and then the greater good is suddenly a heap on the floor andme, me, me is the only show in town. In short, Twig People rule the world andForest People need to get themselves moving and fast. I spoke to a lady who hadbeen targeted by social services after an anonymous phone call alleging that shewas neglecting her children and was ‘a follower of David Icke’ (so she must bementally unstable). I hope no one is a ‘follower’ of me because that is not theidea at all, but the point is that posting my information on a social networkwas being equated with being mentally ill and unfit to look after her children.A social worker questioned her on these allegations – including what she thoughtof me – before accepting the fact during a home visit that the lady wascertainly not neglecting her children and was not mentally unstable. But this iswhat happens with Twig People. They so fail to understand the forest perspectivethat they have to perceive its proponents to be crazy to justify and protecttheir own belief system. If what a Forest Person says has any validity then twigbeliefs are seriously under threat. It’s much easier to dismiss the messenger asinsane, than to face their own insanity. And the extreme twig perspective is aform of insanity. One definition for the term insanity is ‘a mental illness ofsuch a severe nature that a person cannot distinguish fantasy from reality,cannot conduct her/his affairs due to psychosis, or is subject to uncontrollableimpulsive behaviour.’ Psychosis is defined as ‘a mental state caused bypsychiatric or organic illness, characterized by a loss of contact with realityand an inability to think rationally.’ Put that lot together and you have twigbelievers the world over. I mean, is it not a loss of contact with reality andan inability to think rationally to say that reality is not malleable while alsosaying that your knowledge of quantum physics is foggy? But with Twig Peopledominating global society they have hijacked the sense of what is ‘normal’ andthis has made society what it is today and has been since the Archontic hijack.Oh, yes, ‘normal’. This is very interesting and instructive. These are somedefinitions of ‘normal’:[../Images/00181.jpg]Figure 850: Saying it and meaning it gives you incredible power.[../Images/00392.jpg]Figure 851: Normal = sane – one of the most extreme of all inversions.> • Conforming with, adhering to, or constituting a norm, standard, pattern,> level, or type; typical.> • Relating to or characterized by average intelligence or development.> • Free from mental illness; sane.So ‘normal’ is conforming to a standard or typical pattern. But what dictatesand constitutes ‘standard and typical’? The perceptions and behaviour of themajority. Given that the majority are Twig People it is their perceptions andbehaviour that become the standard and typical ‘normal’. The term is also‘characterised by average intelligence or development’ and so to be aboveaverage intelligence makes you abnormal. And here is the punch line ... to benormal is to be ‘free from mental illness; sane’. Everything is inverted asusual. To be free from mental illness and sane is to conform with, adhere to, orconstitute a norm, standard, pattern, level or type; typical; and to relate orbe characterised by average intelligence or development. But how do they defineaverage intelligence or development? It is the average compared with all theothers who believe only in the perceived known. Those that see beyond the‘known’ are, by definition, too intelligent to be considered ‘normal’, but notnormal enough to be considered ‘free from mental illness; sane’. It’s hysterical(Fig 851). If you are born into a madhouse and you know nothing else thenmadness to you is normal. It is still crazy, but it’s normal crazy masqueradingas sanity. Welcome to Planet Earth, a standard, typical, normal, madhouse wherecivilians are bombed to protect them from violence, children starve in a worldof plenty, people borrow money that doesn’t exist and pay interest on it, foodis a form of poison and the inmates can’t see how comprehensively they are beingshafted because they are too busy following their football team, textingmeaningless bollocks and reading about which celebrity is shagging another. Tograsp what is really going on here we have to disconnect the terms ‘sane’ and‘normal’ because they are not at all interchangeable; and we have to realisethat what is termed ‘normal’ is an advanced form of insanity. Once people getthat, everything makes sense and falls into place. Don’t try to make sense ofthe world on the basis that the world is sane and therefore try to work out whyintelligent people would make decisions that cause daily death, destruction,suffering and deprivation. The people making those decisions are mad anddemented and that is why their actions are mad and demented. Those tracts of thepopulation that support those actions and can make rational sense of them are anextension of the same madness and dementia. There you go, it all makes sensenow, right? It is simple cause and effect. The world is mad because thoserunning the world and much of the population are in a state of madness. Thepoint is, though, that they don’t have to be.Open wideWhat I am calling madness is only extreme myopia and ignorance and both are thecreation of a closed and padlocked mind. Open your mind beyond myopia andignorance and the madness will take care of itself. Poof – gone. This process isfar simpler than people believe (what you believe you perceive and what youperceive you experience). It means only to open your sense of the possible toAll Possibility. This brings me to yet another inversion. Most people have abelief system and anything outside of that must prove itself (on their terms) tobe possible. In other words, All Possibility is constantly on trial with thebelief system as the judge. How about taking All Possibility as the norm andmaking anything that speaks of the impossible justify itself? ‘This isimpossible, that’s impossible.’ How do you know? ‘Er ...’ We should not confuse‘It’s never been done’ (how do you know?) with ‘It can’t be done’ (how do youknow?); and the same with ‘I have never seen it done’ (so?) or ‘I cannotconceive that it could be done’ (so?). These are not impossibilities, only asense of the impossible – a belief in the impossible. They said that sailingaround the world was impossible, flying was impossible and as for going intospace – you’re crazy, mate. Running a mile in four minutes was consideredimpossible until someone did it by a fraction and then many others followed inthe knowledge – the belief – that it could be done. Humanity’s sense of thepossible and obsession with the impossible are the greatest enslavers of realprogress. We live within an infinity of possibilities and yet all we need toknow to understand everything is found between the covers of some ancientreligious book? Or in the twigs, tomes and tedium of a ‘science’ which is akinto looking at a wheel nut to try to make sense of a car? What do I need tounderstand the car, Professor Dawkins? ‘You need a spanner the size of thatnut.’ Or, in the words of that superb piece of wisdom: ‘If your only tool is ahammer every problem looks like a nail.’ If your only perception is your beliefsystem every experience looks like it fits. The foundation of any challenge toArchontic control must be, has to be and cannot be anything else but the openingand awakening of Mind to Consciousness outside the Matrix. Without that weshould go home and do what we can to prepare for the inevitable extremes of thetyranny that is heading our way so quickly. People can stockpile all the weaponsthey like, organise all the protests they like and attack the Control System allthey like, but in the end it won’t matter. The Control System is what it is andwhat it is becoming because the mass of humanity is trapped in the perceptionsof mind and that is the home ground of the Archons. They are mind parasites,after all. But they cannot parasitize, manipulate and programme Consciousnessbecause it is way out of their range. Believers in religion, politics andmainstream science are all underpinning the Archontic agenda by falling fortheir game – their mind game. The character in the Matrix trilogy called theTrainman said of his domain:[../Images/00307.jpg]Figure 852: The Matrix may have you – but it is only a choice.> You don’t get it. I built this place. Down here I make the rules. Down here I> make the threats. Down here, I’m God.It was in these terms that the Gnostics described our world in relation to theDemiurge and the Archons. When you are entrapped in the five senses and theirassociated mind your perception of reality is what the Archons tell you it is.The perception deception can only happen in the realm of the mind and the‘physical’ senses (Fig 852). Once you open to All Possibility, when you see thatthe twigs are a forest, your point of attention – of perception – expands intothe realms of Consciousness. From there the forest is so easy to perceive andthe game so easy to understand, but without that understanding how can anyonemake an informed and effective judgement on how to respond to the globalsituation that we face?Who am I?Self-identity is the key to everything. You are the All That Is – the dazzlingdarkness of All-Knowing, All Possibility. But your attention is currentlyfocussed on a tiny range of frequency called visible light and that focus isgiven names and labels like Bill and Emma, Caucasian and Jew, rich and poor. Sowhich ‘you’ are you going to identify with? Do you self-identify with what youreally are or only what you are experiencing? Are you the twig or the forest?Bill and Emma, Caucasian and Jew, rich and poor are all figments of the illusionand if that is your only self-identity then the Matrix rules your perceptionbecause you have no other point of reference for what is happening to you andthe world. Where is your sense of self in Neil Hague’s image? The answer willdecide where you go from here and, collectively, where we all go (Fig 853). Yourlife this far has been dictated by who you thought you were. Change what youthink you are and you will change what you perceive and experience. Together wewill change what we all perceive and experience. There is no way out of where weare unless there is a transformation of our sense of self from the self-identitythat put us where we are (Fig 854). This is stating the obvious, but the obviouscan be an expert in camouflage and disguise, especially when your focus is onthe twigs and not the forest. Twig People perceive reality overwhelminglythrough the brain while Forest People infuse their perception with input fromthe heart. The more you move your point of attention to the heart the more ofthe forest you can see and so the more our suicidal society becomes self-evident. How interesting that the Archon hijack has turned the former heartsociety into one that views almost everything from the gut. Are you a TwigPerson or a Forest Person? Are you are a Brain Person or a Heart Person? Theseare two ways of asking the same question. The Archons have transformed a heartsociety into a gut society to make humanity easy to scam, manipulate andcontrol. In the spirit of removing the cause of the problem we have to change itback again. The heart and associated heart vortex, or chakra, are our primeconnection to the infinite forever. The brain is supposed to be its servant notits master, but the Archon hijack could not have got anywhere close to where itis without the brain usurping the pre-eminence of the heart. The quotes that Ihave used in this book from Leonardo (‘Bold Lion’) da Vinci (1452-1519) areexamples of heart intelligence – wisdom, knowing and insight beyond the realm ofthought. Heart intelligence is beyond time and space and so Da Vinci isconsidered centuries ahead of his ‘time’. He wasn’t. He was beyond time. This iswhy he could gather insight from the timeless and show it to the time-controlled(Fig 855). What he knew and his incredible insight, which was only confirmedhundreds of years later, is always there waiting to be tapped into – no matterwhat the ‘time’, ‘era’ or state of human ‘development’. It was there in theStone Age and it is today in the ‘modern’ Stone Age. Da Vinci knew how to make astream of different technologies which have been built in recent times and shownto work and have inspired others centuries after he died to develop what hecould imagine 500 years before. Da Vinci understood reality and therefore had anexpanded awareness of the possible. Others like Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), whofollowed Da Vinci in Italy, also had the insight that comes from going beyondtime and saw through the official version of reality (Fig 856). It was Bruno whosaid ‘the Divine Light is always in man, presenting itself to the senses and tothe comprehension, but man rejects it’ and ‘heroic love is the property of thosesuperior natures who are called insane, not because they do not know, butbecause they over-know’. The known fears the unknown. Da Vinci and Bruno wereaccessing the same Awareness as were others like K’inich Janaab’ Pakal, theMayan ruler behind the inscriptions in stone of astronomical and astrologicalcycles that were seriously misread by the ‘1212ers’; the Ancient Greekphilosopher Socrates, who challenged convention and authority and was sentencedto death for doing so; and Mahatma Gandhi. I feel a massive connection to whatthey represented. There is a theme through all of them of gaining insight bygoing beyond ‘time’ and/or of questioning the prevailing authority and theimposition of its will upon the population. Giordano Bruno was burnt at thestake for heresy and blasphemy by the Roman Inquisition in 1600 for holdingopinions contrary to the Catholic faith. Bruno told his judges: ‘Perchance youwho pronounce my sentence are in greater fear than I who receive it.’ Hisexecutioners were ordered to tie his tongue so that he could not address thecrowd before his death. Such is the terror of the illusory powerful in the faceof universal power – expanded awareness (Fig 857). Bruno’s crime was to say thatthere are multiple worlds and he described a view of the cosmos which, as withDa Vinci, the centuries have confirmed to be accurate. Bruno wrote in the 16thcentury: ‘In space there are countless constellations, suns and planets; we seeonly the suns because they give light; the planets remain invisible, for theyare small and dark. There are also numberless earths circling around their suns...’ The Church immediately reached for its knickers and gave them a twist.Ludicrous dogma must not be questioned for it threatens the power that isdependent upon the dogma. What Bruno, Da Vinci and all these people tapped intofor their insight may always have been there, but it can only be accessed byopening the mind and crucially the heart. This is the gift of heart intelligencewhile brain (‘intellectual’) intelligence comes from a computer-like assessmentand arrangement of incoming data and if the accepted data is nonsense then theassessment and arrangement of it must be likewise. Bollocks begets bollocks. Thebrain makes its assessments in the same reality as its source information. It isin the world and of it. The heart views everything from outside the illusion. Itis in this world, but not of it. As a result, Brain People see Heart People ascrazy and impossible to fathom and understand. I have been writing all theseyears in book after book about the true power of the heart and its central rolein unravelling the Matrix and now some mainstream scientists are beginning tosee its crucial importance and the real nature of the brain. There is an area ofresearch known as Neuroplasticity – the realisation that the brain is not fixed,but malleable and changeable. They are reassessing the former rigid belief thatthe brain is the driver of behaviour, thought, perception, emotion, disease andhealth. Dr Norman Doidge, author of The Brain That Changes Itself, said:[../Images/00403.jpg]Figure 853: Who do you think you are? The answer will change your life – or not(see colour section).[../Images/00177.jpg]Figure 854: The self-identity of enslavement and freedom.[../Images/00346.jpg]Figure 855: Leonardo da Vinci was beyond time and so beyond the limitations ofhis ‘time’ and any other.[../Images/00004.jpg]Figure 856: Giordano Bruno.[../Images/00383.jpg]Figure 857: Remember, remember ...> The idea that the brain is plastic in the sense of changeable, adaptable and> malleable is the single most important change in our understanding of the> human brain in four hundred years. Neuroplasticity is that property of the> brain that allows it to change its structure and its function; it’s a response> to sensing and perceiving the world, even to thinking and imagining. Human> thoughts and learning actually turn on certain genes in our nerve cells which> allow those cells to make new connections between them.The brain is not the source of anything. It is the conduit, the biologicalcomputer system, which responds to information stimuli and makes it conscious interms of fivesense perception and behaviour. Different areas of the brain becomeactivated, or ‘light up’, when energetic information is received that relates totheir specific role in decoding and communicating information to the holographicconscious mind. The information can come from the heart and the greaterConsciousness (what some call the soul), or it can come from direct Archonticpossession and the endless Archontic programs such as education, science,medicine, media, politics etc., etc., etc. Once you open yourself to heartintelligence – innate intelligence, universal intelligence – the ‘opposition’ isrouted and the heart and brain speak as one (Fig 858). The fact it is such a‘revelation’ that the brain is changeable and malleable shows how far off thepace mainstream ‘science’ is and has been. The brain is a hologram and its basestate is a 100 percent malleable waveform information field. When the fieldchanges, the ‘physical’ brain must change and it is at the waveform andelectromagnetic levels that Archontic possession takes place and the heart mostpowerfully interacts with the brain, although it does so electrically, too. Forthe most extreme possession to happen the heart’s influence must be seriouslycurtailed and that is why the Archons target the heart vortex in the way theyhave structured society and lock people into the emotional chakra in the gut.Positive feelings and perceptions like love and joy (high frequency) come fromthe heart while negative emotions like fear, anxiety, stress and depression (lowfrequency) come from the belly. The idea is to block the influence of the heartby giving people so many reasons to feel fear, anxiety, stress and depression.Stress causes heart disease because it stems the flow of energy through theheart chakra and causes it to form a chaotic field that becomes more intense thelonger the stress continues. This distortion is transferred through to theholographic heart and there you have the reason why in a fearful and stressedsociety that heart disease is a mass global killer. What is called ‘heartache’is when people feel the effect of the distorted heart-field. The effect ofsevere trauma, like losing a loved one, really can cause people to die of a‘broken heart’ because of this. Research by the Institute of HeartMath has shownthat the heart’s electromagnetic fields change in response to emotions and,given that the heart field can be measured several feet from the body, you canappreciate the fundamental effect – positive or negative – the nature of thatfield can have on mental, emotional and bodily health. The heart vortex and itsmassive electromagnetic field is where human perception has been mosteffectively hijacked and we need to reverse that. Nothing is more important thanthis for those who truly want to free themselves from Archontic tyranny. Ifpeople think they can meet this challenge with anger, hatred or violentrevolution they should feel free to waste their time. No shift from gut to heart= global tyranny. Shift from gut to heart = game over. It is possible tooverride and bypass the brain altogether and in fact this must be done to gobeyond ‘time and space’. I have been doing this since my experience in Peru andit gets more powerful and profound the more you do it. This is what Da Vinci,Bruno and the others were doing. Normally information enters what we call theconscious mind through the brain with all the potential interference, blocks andfilters caused by belief, emotion and other programming. But if you move yourpoint of attention from the body out into the infinity beyond the Matrix you canmake a direct connection between expanded insight and your own consciousawareness. The ‘cavalry’ hasn’t come to you – you have gone to the ‘cavalry’.With the insight absorbed by your expanded point of attention you can bring thatback to five-sense reality through the heart as intuitive knowing and not asmere thought which is routed through the brain (Fig 859). This is how we can tapinto infinite insight and inspired knowing and bring it through into thisreality in a pure and untarnished form. I spend very little of my day in this‘world’ any longer except to the extent that I need to function. When I amwriting books or delivering talks the only part of me in this reality is mybody.[../Images/00161.jpg]Figure 858: The power of the heart will change everything (see colour section).[../Images/00238.jpg]Figure 859: The brain bypass – Heart consciousness overriding thought (seecolour section).Live, love, laugh and be happyThere is a saying about laughing in the face of danger and we need to laugh inthe face of Archontic oppression. It may sound strange to say that, but then Iam, apparently. The world that we think we see is not the world that we live in.Humanity believes overwhelmingly in a world that is solid and that actions leadto change. Well, the world is not solid and actions don’t lead to change in thesense that they are the primary source of making the change. Actions areresponses to perceptions. The choice of behaviour is made by perception. Actionis not a choice, but a response to a choice made in the unseen levels ofawareness, or lack of it. To those that don’t understand this basic truth anychallenge to tyranny must be made through action. But if we focus only on actionand ignore perception our focus remains in the realm of the five senses wherewhat we call action takes place. I am not condemning action in and of itselfbecause this is how perception is transferred into holographic change. I amtaking action all the time – by writing this book, for example, and launchingthe television and radio station, The People’s Voice. But if actions are theoffspring of perception then it is perception that must first be addressed ifthe action is to be truly effective rather than merely an emotional reaction tofear, hatred, anger and resentment. Distorted perception leads inevitably todistorted action. We must ‘do something’ must become we must ‘be something’.From the being the doing will take care of itself. How many times have we seenviolent oppression met with violent reaction that leads to another form ofoppression? History is littered with such illusory ‘revolution’ and it must beso when Brain People are responding to the actions of Brain People. One lot ofBrain People might replace another lot of Brain People but the outcome mustalways be the same – a Brain Society. Round and round we go. The road may seemto go over the horizon, but it’s really a carousel and you’ll be back where youstarted pretty soon. What I am saying here was described by Da Vinci in terms of‘where the spirit does not work with the hand, there is no art’. Great art comesfrom the heart. Inspired artists are inspired heartists and the same with greatcomposers like Mozart. And art does not refer only to painting a canvas exceptin the widest sense. It is also painting words on a paper or computer screencanvas as books, poetry and lyrics. It is painting joy in your life and thelives of others. It is painting a new reality on the global canvas by turningthe urgings and longings of the heart into a new world of love, freedom andmutual respect. Isn’t that what we want? Then that is what we must be if we areto achieve this. The rest is detail. John Lennon sang this about revolution:‘... when you talk about destruction, don’t you know that you can count me out.’That goes for me, too. It may appeal to the ‘real man’ self-image of the JohnWayne testosterone junkies to say we must ‘fight’ the Control System and itspersonnel, but to me that is just more ignorance, more self-indulgence, moreBrain People wanting to mix it with Brain People. Humanity has tried that somany times and when the battles were over the Archons remained in controlworking through a new set of stooges. Another bonus for the Archons is all thelow-vibrational emotional energy that ‘fighting for good’ creates for those‘fighting for bad’.We have to stop feeding the beast and that means to stop reacting to thecalculated stimuli engineered by the beast to feed the beast. This is wherelive, love, laugh and be happy comes in. People find it so hard to love otherswith whom they have no connection and especially those they don’t like ordisagree with. But this is the real challenge that we need to meet becauseeverything will follow from that. This is the most profound of all Archonticdivide and rules and we must not fall for it any longer. Loving someone does notmean that you lay down and let them walk all over you and do whatever they wantno matter what the consequences for others. We love our children, but if weallow them to do what they like in the name of love we can create self-obsessedadults who will suffer the consequences through social exclusion their entirelives. So we may not always like what our children do and we may rightly say so,but we still love them. We need to be the same with the wider human family – allexpressions of the same Oneness or Isness – and with the loveless, heartlesspsychopaths that seek to enslave us. No one needs to be opened to love more thanthey do. Gandhi said: ‘Whenever you are confronted with an opponent conquer himwith love.’ If we challenge them with anger and hatred we are playing their gamewhile expressing a desire to change it. The whole point is to stop playing theirgame, not to play it from a different point of observation. The Archons andtheir hybrids want to us to hate each other, fight with each other and oppresseach other. They want us to ridicule or condemn those with a differentperception of reality – especially those who are exposing them to publicattention. The last thing they want is for humanity to become widely aware oftheir existence, intent and methods of manipulation. They want us to divide andfight along the manufactured fault lines of race, religion, culture, politics,jobs and income. They created the fault lines in the first place precisely forthis purpose. We have to stop walking constantly into the traps that are laidfor us and the biggest trap, on which all the others stand or fall, is to closeour hearts and forget that we are all the same Infinite Awareness havingdifferent experiences. The experiences are challenging, too, and incrediblyextreme when compared with reality beyond the Matrix. We need to give ourselvesa break and not be destructively self-judgemental and at war with ourselves.Self-loathing is the most devastating loathing of all. American author DannionBrinkley was rightly told during a famous near-death experience that anyone whocomes to this reality is a hero. Dannion wrote in his book, Saved by the Light:> ’You humans are truly the heroes’, a Being told me. ‘Those who go to earth are> heroes and heroines, because you are doing something that no other spiritual> beings have the courage to do’.Dannion was struck by lightning in 1975 and was clinically dead for 28 minutes.During this and subsequent near-death experiences he said he was told that humanevents are not cast in stone and can be changed, but first humanity needed torealise (remember) that ‘love is treating others the way they themselves want tobe treated’. When I speak of love I mean the unconditional variety, founded onintegrity, not the illusory ‘love’ that we call physical attraction. I have longsaid that the most important sentence in the Bible is ‘Do unto others as youwould have them do unto you’. This is the Golden Rule that can be foundthroughout human culture:> Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself. – Confucius in> China That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another. – Ancient> Egypt What you do not want to happen to you, do not do it yourself either. –> Ancient Greece Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful. –> Buddhism One should never do that to another which one regards as injurious to> one’s own self. – HinduismYou find the same theme everywhere and it also connects to the concept of karma,or cause and effect, in that what you do to others in this reality will reboundback to you, the nice and not so nice. Martin Luther King was describingsomething similar when he said that ‘the arc of the moral universe is long, butit bends towards justice’. So many ‘people’ have left the body at what we calldeath thinking they had ‘won’ the game only to find that in the greater schemeof things they had ‘lost’ comprehensively in the sense that what they thoughtwas best for them in the moment – me, me, me – looked very different when theveil was lifted. People might expect me to set out a whole plan and manifestohere for bringing down the Archontic system, but I don’t need to. The answersare simple and they lie in the heart. Effective action will follow – and onlyfollow – once we have freed ourselves from the perception deception. Thisrequires the open-minded pursuit of knowledge and the end of close-mindedignorance and the arrogance that protects belief from re-appraisal; it meanslifting the eyes from the twigs to see the forest; questioning the ‘known’ andexploring the ‘unknown’; remembering that we are Infinite Awareness and notlittle me; moving our attention and point of interaction from belly emotions tothe heart; loving, respecting and supporting each other; and doing unto othersas we would have done unto us. I do not have a banner and I am not screamingthrough a megaphone, but I have just described the ultimate revolution – therevolution of perception and self-identity. This is the foundation, inspirationand spirit from which any change must come. Without this there will be nochange, only a recycled ‘new’ as a projection of the old. We do not need loudvoices in pursuit of being heard. We need voices that refuse to be silenced. DaVinci said: ‘Where there is shouting, there is no true knowledge.’ I am notsaying that we should not speak with conviction, feeling and urgency, but notwith anger and hatred and a quest for revenge. That is the Archon way and itshould not be ours or we cannot claim to be different. Mahatma Gandhi was notloud and nor did he hate the oppressors that he set out to challenge, but he wasimmoveable and unbreakable. We need to be calm and let the deeper self be heardthrough the chatter, shouting and background noise. Once we connect through theheart and open-mindedness to expanded awareness in the silence beyond themadhouse we never need to ask again – what can I do? We instinctively know,individually and collectively, and the most effective action will intuitivelyflow.The end of the beginningI know it sounds trite to say laugh and be happy in the light of the dailychallenges and often horrors that humans endure and this is another reason whyit is vital that humanity awakens to its true identity as Infinite Awareness.For those suffering war, oppression, financial meltdown and hunger to the pointof starvation their lives will appear to be without hope and purpose. What isthe point of living just to suffer and see your loved ones suffer? Life is justto suffer and die? But why? I have explained the ‘why?’ at great length in thisbook and we need to put this ‘life’ in perspective before we are consumed by theconfusion and bewilderment that is systematically set before us. Whatever we arecurrently experiencing as what we believe to be ‘humans’ we remain and willalways be the Infinite Awareness of All Possibility. This is what we were beforewe came ‘here’; this is what we will be when we ‘leave’; and this is what we arein the Infinite NOW that we call today. Most people have just forgotten and beenencouraged since birth to forget. So we are All That Is, Has Been And Ever CanBe. As bottom lines go that is pretty fantastic don’t you think? The illusion isdesigned to keep us from this sparkling truth and move our attention into asingle experience within All Possibility to kid us that the experience is who weare. From that perspective life can seem a daily nightmare and that’s the idea.But when we self-identify with the true self we see that this world and all thatit entails is but a brief focus of Infinite attention, an infinitesimal fractionwithin the no-time of forever. It is hard to laugh at life when you are ladenwith the fear of the ‘present’ and the ‘future’ and the regret and resentment ofthe ‘past’. But when you know that you are the Eternal One having a shortexperience in a world that is completely bonkers smiles come easier to yourface. When people watch a zany sitcom with the characters doing crazy and stupidthings they tend to laugh at the lunacy before them. It is a good tool foremotional survival to view our reality from the same perspective because ithelps us to detach from much of its negative influence. It’s a madhouse whichthinks it is sane and if you look at it from this point of observation there isso much that we are supposed to take seriously that will constantly give you thegiggles. It does me, anyway. The Archons and their hybrids can cope withhostility and being disliked, but they cannot cope with not being takenseriously. It disarms their most essential weapon – fear. When we do not fearthem they have no power for our fear is their power. We need to open our eyes tothe beauty, love and reasons to be joyous that still exist in this world despiteeverything. Of course there will be sad times and challenging times and life isabout balance anyway; but that balance is way out of kilter in favour of thebelly emotions and the heart needs to dramatically redress that. The Archonscannot feed off joyous laughter and they cannot feed off love in itsunconditional sense. Fear is their food and it is time for them to startfasting. What is this fear, anyway? Is it the fear of death? There is no death,just a transfer of Infinite attention from this reality to another. GiordanoBruno could smile in the face the burning stake because he knew that. Is it thefear of condemnation and ridicule from the programmed ignorant for speaking outagainst programmed ignorance? Few people could have been ridiculed more than meand condemned, too. But I am still here and stronger than ever. Da Vinci wasdismissed and ridiculed; Bruno was ridiculed and condemned; so were Socrates andGandhi. But look what they achieved in their lives and since with wisdom thathas spanned the ages. Everyone who has taken the world forward in itsunderstanding of self and reality has been ridiculed and condemned by those whowish to maintain an ongoing state of ignorance and those who meekly follow withtheir lassoed minds. It goes with the territory, but so what? Voltaire said:‘Our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden pathalways throw stones at those who are showing a new road.’ Are we going to letour pursuit of the infinite be suppressed by the finite? Or our pursuit of thewise be suppressed by the unwise? Fuck that. No chance.I am sure that this book has been immensely challenging for many people on manylevels. There is the invitation to put aside all that they have ever thought andbelieved in and to let it justify itself anew, or even for the first time. Thereis the fact that all of us wish that what I have written and exposed – well, thenot so nice parts – did not have validity. It is far easier to dismiss somethingthat you don’t want to be true. There is the apparent magnitude of what needs tobe done and how we do it. But if we sit quietly and focus on the wisdom of theheart and set the mind free to explore pastures new, we can see through theperception deception and become aware of the true magnificence of who we are.When that breakthrough comes, and it can happen so fast when you snap the chainsof programmed belief, the world is a very different place and the answers arefar simpler than they seem to the frightened and bewildered five senses. Thereis so much that we have to do and it is all founded on opening the heart andmind, putting aside irrelevant divisions of race, religion, culture and incomebracket, and collectively ceasing to cooperate with our own enslavement.Billions can only be controlled by a tiny few because the billions acquiescethrough ignorance, fear and divide and rule. We need organised non-cooperationacross the world so that the Control System cannot function and this includesthe support of those in uniform who are awakening to the truth. They need tostop policing the people in the interests of the El-lite. If laws are not fair,just and equally applied then they must be subject to non-cooperation both bythe population and law enforcement. Otherwise, what happens? The Archontic fewpass laws through a rigged system for their own benefit and the uniforms enforcethem on a compliant people. This is a vicious cycle of constant and increasingcontrol that can only be broken by mass non-compliance. Awakening scientistsneed to speak out and expose the suppression of knowledge and the nonsense ofhuman-caused climate change; aware government insiders must expose the lies,deceit and the agenda masked by the engineered diversions and politicalrhetoric; and those claiming to be journalists should simply do their job. SouthAfrican peace activist Desmond Tutu said: ‘If you are neutral in situations ofinjustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor’. I wrote in Remember WhoYou Are, and spoke at the Wembley Arena event in 2012 about my concept of what Icall the non-comply dance where we turn protest into non-compliant celebrationsof life with music, dancing, joy, the exchange of information and immovabledetermination not to acquiesce and be intimidated into compliance and conformityto laws that are nothing more than prison bars to entrap the population in anOrwellian nightmare. If we don’t cease to comply with our own servitude then wewill commit ourselves – and our loved ones – into every aspect of the Archonticagenda that I have exposed. But it doesn’t have to be. We are the many and theyare the few and we still have a choice to stand in their way or stand aside.[../Images/00157.jpg]Figure 860: The power is with the oppressed majority and when we remember thatand come together in unity of purpose the Archontic thrones shall fall.There is much to be encouraged about and we have come such a long way in publicawareness since the day that I walked into Betty Shine’s front room and my lifechanged forever. For many of the long years that followed it seemed like ahopeless task, but something drove me on and the waters began to part. Slowly atfirst, then more quickly, and now the dam is becoming fit to burst. I don’tquote Winston Churchill very often, but one of his speeches is most appropriatetoday in a very different context. He said of the state of the war in 1942: ‘Nowthis is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is,perhaps, the end of the beginning.’ I would contend that this book and where weare now in the gathering awareness of the hidden truths are the end of thebeginning and the start of a whole new phase. Those working to expose theconspiracy in all its multiple forms would not have taken long to count in 1990when I sat amazed as Betty Shine told me what I was going to do. But look aroundtoday and there are millions playing their part in uncovering the lies andmanipulation and hundreds of millions worldwide who are seeing through thesmokescreens and illusions. The people are starting to stir and the lion ispreparing to roar. As the ‘little me-ers’ awaken the dominoes shall fall (Fig860). This number can only grow exponentially. It may be far from everybody’sdaily experience, but minds are opening and this is indeed the end of thebeginning of the human awakening (Fig 861). From here we need to expand accessto that awareness and turn the exponential curve to the sky, and we need to turnknowledge and good intention into mass cooperation with each other andnoncompliance with the system of control. It is said that knowledge is power,but only if we use it effectively. Knowledge is actually not power in itself –the use of knowledge is power and that is what we urgently need to do as we takethis forward. And what a prize awaits us when we succeed in dismantling theArchon structures of oppression. The words of Neo in The Matrix are very apt:[../Images/00050.jpg]Figure 861: Exactly.> I know you’re out there. I can feel you now. I know that you’re afraid ...> you’re afraid of us. You’re afraid of change. I don’t know the future. I> didn’t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you> how it’s going to begin ...> ... I’m going to show these people what you don’t want them to see. I’m going> to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without> borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible ...The reality the Archons hijacked was a paradise and when all the manipulations,engineered conflicts, systematic scarcity and suppression of knowledge are nomore what will therefore be left?Paradise.Isn’t that worth doing whatever it takes? Oh yes, oh yes. So what are we waitingfor? Let’s get on with it."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00420.jpg]On April 15th, 2013 we had the bombings at the Boston Marathon which killedthree people and injured more than 260. The attack was blamed on twoAmerica-based ethnic Chechens, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his 19-year-oldbrother Dzhokhar, but, as always, there is far more to know (Fig 1). The bombsare said to have been carried in backpacks and there were corporatemilitaryoperatives all over the scene before the bombs went off carrying backpacks. Thiscreates a situation akin to those street magicians who put a ball under one ofthree cups and then move them around and ask you to guess which cup covers theball. There were so many backpacks and so which ones contained the bombs? Whoknows? – and that’s the idea. In fact, who knows for sure that the bombs wereeven connected to backpacks? They may have been but the only reason that peoplethink this is the case is because the police have said so. Excuse me, but I gaveup believing anything the police say without confirming evidence a very longtime ago. But they showed us an exploded backpack? And? How simple is that? Itis so easy even for those who question official stories to be lulled into theacceptance of certain ‘facts’ when they are only ‘facts’ because they wereannounced by the authorities and repeated to death by the media until theybecome an ‘everyone knows that’. Two things that we actually do know aboutBoston are that corporate-military personnel can be seen in photographs allaround the finish line before the bombings and that there was a ‘practice’ drillgoing on yet again that mirrored what subsequently happened. The mainstreammedia ignored, even ridiculed the latter, while multiple witnesses confirmedthis was true (Fig 2). Athletics coach Ali Stevenson, who completed his run justbefore the first bomb went off at the finish line, told Local 15 TV:[../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 1: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev among the crowd at the Boston Marathon.> They kept making announcements on the loud speaker that it was just a drill> and there was nothing to worry about. It seemed like there was some sort of> threat, but they kept telling us it was just a drill.The evidence from the start clearly pointed to government-military involvementin the Boston attacks even before we got to the fine detail which takes muchlonger to expose and often, given the multi-layers of secrecy andcompartmentalisation, you never do uncover everything there is to know. Whatmakes the themes easier to spot, however, is that the foundation ‘blueprint’ ofstaged events like Boston is repeated time and again and this includes the‘drill’ that runs side-by-side with real events. The list of these is nowgetting ridiculous. There were mirror-drills happening in or near the samelocations as the real events in the case of ... 9/11, the 7/7 London bombings,the Oslo bombing, the Madrid train bombings, Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston, and soon. The drill is the excuse to have corporate-military personnel all over thescene or in the close vicinity and while most may genuinely think they aretaking part in a practice scenario the key players will know the real story andbe able to operate behind the cover of the drill. It also offers the opportunityto recruit people who think they are playing the part of fake bombers in thedrill to be caught on camera in the wrong place at the wrong time and be blamedfor a real bombing instigated by the Hidden Hand. Boston had all these elementsand potential possibilities. These are multiple images of corporate-militarypersonnel at the scene of the bombings before they happened and hurrying awayafterwards – one apparently now without a backpack (Figs 3 and 4). There weremany of these people at the scene in the same clothing, often with backpacks,and their uniform fits that of an organisation called Craft International. Thisspecialises in ‘military, law-enforcement and civilian training, as well asprivate security and protection’. Craft was established by former Navy SealChris Kyle who was described as a devout Christian while also claiming to be themost lethal sniper in American military history. I guess he must have missed thebit about thou shalt not kill and turning the other cheek. Kyle was shot deadwith his associate Chad Littlefield in February, 2013 apparently by ‘a troubledveteran whom they were trying to help’, according to a Craft Internationalstatement. It added that Kyle had ‘a profound effect on the lives of those hetouched’. Yes, I suppose with a record-breaking sniper that does tend to happen.Craft International is one of a series of private ‘security’ companies mostlyrun by former military personnel that are contracted (a few officially, manyunofficially) by the US government to carry out operations that can be done atarm’s length from official channels. The most notorious of these is Blackwaterwhich keeps changing its name to hide its history. It became Xe Services beforethe current cover name of Academi. Blackwater was founded in 1997 by ErikPrince, another former Seal, with the familiar brief of providing ‘trainingsupport to military and law enforcement organizations’ and it has operatedwidely in Afghanistan and Iraq where many have died controversially at itshands.[../Images/00396.jpg]Figure 2: Sniffer dogs at the marathon before the bombs went off.[../Images/00373.jpg]Figure 3: Corporate-military operatives with backpacks near the scene of thebombings before the devices went off.[../Images/00111.jpg]Figure 4: They hurry away afterwards. What were they doing there?[../Images/00168.jpg]Figure 5: The logo on the ‘men in black’ at the marathon and founder Chris Kylewith the same logo of his Craft International.So here you had personnel from Craft International, a ‘private’ military‘training and support’ organisation, on and around the finish line of the BostonMarathon before the bombs went off and the authorities have simply refused toanswer questions from the alternative media about what they were doing there orthe fact that a drill, including sniffer dogs, was happening at the time. Theydid not have to refuse to answer the same questions from the mainstream mediabecause they were never asked. The ‘men in black’ at the scene were at firstconnected to Navy Seals because of their badge, but this is also used by CraftInternational, no doubt because of its Navy Seal connections through the lateChris Kyle (Fig 5). Even what has been established this far should make anyonewith a mind to call their own start to doubt the official story given that theauthorities are lying about the drill and refusing to answer basic questionsabout what Craft International was doing at the scene (Fig 6). It isfundamentally significant that one of the brothers blamed for the attacks,Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had connections to US law enforcement and security agencieslike the FBI and CIA and he would certainly have been in a position to be set upin a ‘drill’ or agent provocateur ‘sting’. His mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, saidthat Tamerlan, her eldest son who was killed by the police, was under thecontrol of the FBI – an organisation notorious for covertly setting up targetsthrough its agents and informants to plan terrorist attacks and then eitherclaiming to have foiled them just in time or allowing them to go ahead when theycould have been stopped. This has prompted bizarre, though accurate, headlinessuch as: ‘The FBI again thwarts its own terror plot’. Examples of this FBI modusoperandi include the World Trade Center bombing of 1993; the Oklahoma bombing of1995; the ‘thwarted’ attack on Fort Dix personnel in 2007; the ‘thwarted’ bombattack in Portland, Oregon, in 2010; and the ‘thwarted’ attack on a bridge inOhio in 2012 (Fig 7). The FBI has admitted to ‘thwarting’ 17 ‘terrorist’ plotsthat they originally instigated. Robert Mueller, the head of the FBI at the timeof 9/11, continues to run the agency on behalf of those that control him and hehas overseen outrageous plots to set up their patsy targets. It is against thisbackground that we should consider the connections between the two allegedBoston bombers and the FBI. Their mother said of elder son, Tamerlan:[../Images/00388.jpg]Figure 6: Craft personnel at the marathon finish line immediately after thebombing.[../Images/00174.jpg]Figure 7: Strange but true.> My son, he was set up.

They used to come home; they used to come and talk to me; they used> to tell me that they are counselling …His father, Anzor Tsarnaev, said the FBI had watched his son closely and visitedhim at home:> Yes, I was there. It was in Cambridge [Massachusetts]. They said: ‘We know> what sites you are on, we know where you are calling, we know everything about> you. Everything.’ They said we are checking and watching – that’s what they> said.The Russian newspaper Izvestia claimed to be in possession of documents leakedfrom the Republic of Georgia Interior Ministry which revealed how TamerlanTsarnaev attended seminars in Georgia between January and July of 2012 arrangedby the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation. This was established in 1984 byCIA Director William Casey and remains extremely close to the CIA. The seminarsalso involved an organisation known to be associated with the JamestownFoundation called the Caucasus Fund which was founded after the Georgia-Russiaconflict in 2008 with the aim of recruiting intelligence operatives to work insouthern Russia. The Tsarnaev family is of Chechen origin and separatists inChechnya in the North Caucasus have fought an overt and covert war forindependence from Russia although this has diminished in the last few years (Fig8). The Jamestown Foundation brings us to major global conspiracy asset,Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former National Security Advisor to President Carter,co-founder with David Rockefeller of the Cabal’s Trilateral Commission, and, byhis own statements, the man who drew the Soviet Union into its disastrousinvasion of Afghanistan by arming and training Afghan terrorists to target theSoviet satellite regime then in power in the capital Kabul. These Brzezinskiterrorists became known as the Mujahedeen/Taliban and the US arranged for Osamabin Laden to be despatched to Afghanistan from Saudi Arabia to be the frontmanfor the resistance to the Soviet invasion before blaming him for 9/11 and usingthat to justify their own Afghan invasion. The Jamestown Foundation wasestablished to support Soviet dissidents and you would expect Brzezinski to beinvolved given his obsessive hatred of Russia. Brzezinski has served on theJamestown board of directors and anything that he is involved with is servingthe interests of the Cabal. The US industrial-militaryintelligence complex hasbeen covertly targeting Russia in the Caucasus as part of its plan to controlthe entire region known as Eurasia which connects Europe to China and Russia tothe Middle East. This includes support for groups seeking the separation ofChechnya from Russia and the propaganda against Iran is also part of thisEurasia agenda. The Russian (Zionist) Mafia is heavily represented in theCaucasus, too, as it is in the United States. Brzezinski has said that, ineffect, he who controls Eurasia controls the world and there are many forces andgroups at work here. Another significant US organisation in the region is theAmerican Committee for Peace in the Caucasus (ACPC), sponsored by the right-wingorganization Freedom House, whose board members have included Brzezinski, 9/11Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his more powerful ‘deputy’, PaulWolfowitz, among many other players in the global conspiracy. Freedom House iscurrently chaired by William Howard Taft IV, greatgrandson of President WilliamHoward Taft, and he served in both the Reagan and Boy Bush administrations aswell as being a permanent representative at NATO. The director of the JamestownFoundation seminars in the Caucasus in 2012, allegedly attended by TamerlanTsarnaev, was reportedly a former employee of Freedom House. George Soros, thefinancial manipulator, Brzezinski associate and Rothschild gofer, has long beenheavily involved in the Caucasus region with his front operations like the OpenSociety Institute and Central Eurasia Project which has sponsored events withthe Jamestown Foundation. US investigative journalist Wayne Madsen wrote:[../Images/00054.jpg]Figure 8: The North Caucasus including Russia-controlled Chechnya and Dagestan(where the Tsarnaev parents live) and the former Soviet Republic of Georgiawhere the Jamestown Foundation ran its ‘seminars’.> Upon becoming President in 2009, Barack Obama adopted [Senator John] McCain’s> proposal and authorized CIA support for North Caucasus secessionists and> terrorists with money laundered through the USAID, the National Endowment for> Democracy, Soros’s Open Society Institute, Freedom House, and the Jamestown> Foundation.> In January 2012, Obama appointed a Soros activist and neocon, Michael McFaul> of the rightwing Hoover Institution at Stanford University, as U.S. ambassador> to Moscow.

Agents interviewed him and members of his family, but an FBIstatement said no evidence was found against him of terrorist activity of anykind. Tsarnaev travelled to Chechnya’s Russian neighbour Dagestan on the CaspianSea in 2012 where members of his family now live and he was allowed to movearound freely before leaving which doesn’t fit with the Russian concern abouthis potential terrorist activities against them. In fact, very little fitsbecause there is a whole other story that we are not being told. US Secretary ofState John Kerry (Rothschild Zionist) stated that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been‘radicalised’ during a six-month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya in 2012 – thetime of the Jamestown seminars. It became ever clearer that the Tsarnaev family,both in Dagestan and America, has many connections to US intelligence and lawenforcement agencies and this is why the mother can be so adamant that her sonswere set up. Her words and manner reveal knowledge of how the game works.Despite this long backstory that the FBI has with the Tsarnaevs, a few daysafter the bombings an arrogant and yet still nervous-looking RichardDeslauriers, the FBI special agent in charge of the Boston Division, producedpictures of the brothers at a news conference and asked for the public’s help inidentifying them. He said:> Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbours, co-workers,> or family members of the suspects. Though it may be difficult, the nation is> counting on those with information to come forward.How crazy can you get when they had to know exactly who they were? But this wasnothing to do with identifying suspects. It was to introduce them to the publicconsciousness in preparation for the cover story that was about to be told. Withthis in mind, Deslauriers said at this same news conference:> For clarity, these images should be the only ones – the only ones – that the> public should view to assist us. Other photos [of the Craft International> agents] should not be deemed credible and unnecessarily divert the public’s> attention in the wrong direction and create undue work for vital law> enforcement resources.Here is our story and nothing is going to be allowed to question or contradictit. By dawn of the next morning Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been killed by police andhis brother was on the run. Then there was the alleged bombers’ uncle, RuslanTsarni (formerly Tsarnaev), who faced the media outside his home in Marylandimmediately after his nephews were named but not yet found and condemned them atthe top of his voice (Fig 9). I thought as I watched him that he was strangelyjumping the gun accepting their guilt from no more than a police report and thevehemence of his delivery led me to conclude that he knew far more than he wassaying and/or he wanted to distance himself as comprehensively as possible andprotect his own standing and reputation. He blamed a bloke from Armenia forbrainwashing Tamerlan into Islamic extremism and later blamed Tamerlan’s mother.What Ruslan Tsarni said, and the way that he said it, was key to confirming inthe public mind at that early stage that the two men the FBI had highlightedwere indeed the Boston bombers. So who is Ruslan Tsarni? Investigativejournalist Wayne Madsen mentioned the connections between USAID, the UnitedStates Agency for International Development which has been widely connected tothe CIA, and the American organisations manipulating events in the NorthCaucasus. The Kremlin demanded in 2012 that the American government close itsUSAID office in Moscow amid claims that it was plotting to create oppositiongroups in Russia to unseat President Putin, and the Bolivian President EvoMorales announced around the time of the Boston attack that he was expellingUSAID from his country for seeking to ‘conspire against’ the Bolivian people andgovernment. Uncle Ruslan, it turns out, was contracted as a ‘consultant’ toUSAID in the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan in the early 1990s and hascontinued to be connected to the US government agency. The Tsarnaev family livedclose to the Kazakhstan border at Tokmok in Kyrgyzstan before moving to theUnited States. According to Timur Toktonaliev, a Radio Free Europe and KyrgyzService correspondent, the Tsarnaevs were well known in Tokmok and lived nextdoor to organized crime boss Aziz Batukaev, himself an ethnic Chechen. You cansee in Figure 10 the significance of Kazakhstan to the ‘control Eurasia’ agendawhich includes the subjugation of the Caspian Sea countries with their massivereserves of oil and gas. This is another prime reason why they are desperate toattack Iran and look at the other associated countries that have already beeninvaded or are under attack … Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Anyway,back to Uncle Ruslan Tsarni. Daniel Hopsicker at MadCow Morning News wrote:[../Images/00173.jpg]Figure 9: Uncle Ruslan – so much more to know about him.[../Images/00257.jpg]Figure 10: The Eurasia wish list.> In between his stints with the obviously-conflicted US Agency, Ruslan Tsarni> worked for several Halliburton-controlled oil companies, as well as a Kazakh> man charged with a major banking scandal in Kazakhstan whose repercussions> earlier this year stretched all the way to London.Halliburton is an infamous company (see many of my other books) connected to BoyBush vice-president Dick Cheney and it works closely with the US military andintelligence agencies. Ruslan Tsarni is described as a lawyer and oil executive.It is worth reading an Internet article at MadCow Morning News headed ‘WasBoston Bombers “Uncle Ruslan” with the CIA?’ for some very interestingbackground to this man’s activities. Tsarni established a company in 1995 calledthe Congress of Chechen International Organizations which sent aid to Islamicterrorists in Chechnya and listed its address as the home of Graham Fuller, thevice-chairman of the CIA’s National Intelligence Council during the Reaganpresidency. Fuller had earlier been CIA National Intelligence Officer for theNear East and South Asia – the very region we are talking about – and was CIAstation chief in the Afghan capital Kabul. Fuller has confirmed this informationabout Ruslan Tsarni (Tsarnaev) and his company and that Uncle Ruslan was marriedto Fuller’s daughter, Samantha Ankara Fuller, a UK/US dual national who at thetime of her marriage to Tsarni was an investment adviser to Dresdner Bank and JP Morgan (Fig 11). They married in 1995, the year that Tsarni established theCongress of Chechen International Organizations at the address of the CIA’sGraham Fuller. Father Fuller is quoted by intelligence whistleblower SibelEdmonds as saying:[../Images/00365.jpg]Figure 11: The CIA’s Graham Fuller and his daughter who was married to thealleged Boston bombers’ uncle.> The policy of guiding the evolution of Islam and of helping them against our> adversaries worked marvellously well in Afghanistan against the Red Army. The> same doctrines can still be used to destabilize what remains of Russian power,> and especially to counter the Chinese influence in Central Asia.Sibel Edmonds, an Iranian-American former FBI translator and founder of theNational Security Whistleblowers Coalition, also said that Tamerlan Tsarnaevfitted precisely the profile of people the CIA seeks to recruit for operationsin the Caucasus and so did the way his mother described the approach by the FBIand his long-term ‘counselling’ by its agents. Tsarnaev was married to KatherineRussell, an American ‘Islam convert’ who is reported to be the granddaughter ofSkull and Bones Society member, Richard W Russell, and she was photographedlooking remarkably carefree in the days after her husband’s death. Theauthorities claimed to have found ‘Al-Qaeda’ material on her computer, but shedenied involvement in the bombings. This is the background information thatreveals the forces and networks operating behind the cover of the official andludicrous narrative of the Boston bombings. The US/Britain/NATO alliance isworking to destabilise the Russian-controlled countries of the Caucasus usingagents, informants and the very Islamic fanatics that it condemns elsewhere whenit suits them. The US and British governments say they must fight Islamicextremism in Afghanistan and elsewhere while arming, funding and training thevery same people in Syria, the Caucasus, Libya and other parts of Africa. Thoseinvolved are too stupid and mindless to see how they are being manipulated to acommon end which includes their own destruction. The aim is to have these idiotslook to US-controlled Saudi Arabia and Qatar for their leadership and guidance –the very two Islamic states at the forefront of supporting the US-controlledIslamic mercenaries in Libya and Syria with money and arms. Many in Libya haverealised that Qatar is just a puppet of the US and effigies of its Emir havebeen burned in Tripoli along with the Qatari flag since the fake ‘revolution’.Somehow caught up in all this on April 15th, 2013, and we may never know exactlyhow, were Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev at the Boston Marathon. If they weregenuine bombers the FBI knew enough about them to have stopped the attack and ifthey were patsies the FBI knew enough about them to have set them up. Despiteall the people with backpacks on view near the finish line – including all ofthose from Craft International – the authorities told people that all otherimages were not relevant. They were only interested in those of the Tsarnaevsbecause they were the names on the song sheet. The brothers’ parents said thatthe FBI had been watching Tamerlan Tsarnaev for up to five years and that heknew they were tracking him. So how could the bombing have been allowed tohappen if the official story is true? His parents said that the FBI had calledTamerlan after the bombings to accuse him of being involved. He had replied‘That’s your problem’, his father said. The brothers do not appear to have livedstrict Islamic lifestyles to say the least or to have been obsessed withreligion and we should remember that virtually everything ‘we know’ about themand what happened between the bombings and their death and capture was only whatthe authorities have told us. They said that Tamerlan died in a shoot-out withpolice and when his brother ran over him in a car trying to get away, but thatis not what a witness close to the scene said happened. The witness, referred toas Linda, was interviewed on WEEI 93.7 FM in Boston on April 19th. She said thatshe was at her boyfriend’s house at the location where Tamerlan is said to havedied. Linda said she heard gunfire getting louder and closer to the house: ‘Ijust started screaming because I knew something was wrong. We rushed to thefront of the house … where we saw the first suspect get hit by a police SUV andafter he was hit [he was] shot multiple times.’ She said that minutes later anambulance arrived to take the man away and ‘within moments we were surrounded bySWAT, Boston Police, Watertown Police, Cambridge Police … It’s been toughwatching the neighbours being pulled out of their houses at gun point and theSWAT …’ Linda was asked to confirm that the police vehicle hit Tamerlan Tsarnaevfirst and she replied ‘Correct’. She added: ‘I did not see him fire, I justremember seeing him get shot multiple times.’ Tamerlan Tsarnaev was dead andcould not speak for himself and we were left with the police to tell us what hadhappened as the search was launched for younger brother Dzhokhar. The onlynarrative about this came once again from the police and the idea is to get yourstory out first and make that the only one that most people ever hear. This iswhat happened with 9/11 and happens every time. We were told that Dzhokhar hadbeen captured in another shoot-out after being found hiding in a boat but itemerged that it could not have been a ‘shoot-out’ because officials later saidthat he didn’t have a gun and a police officer injured in the capture was thevictim of ‘friendly-fire’. The police said that Dzhokhar would possibly beunable to talk after ‘shooting himself in the throat’. If, as they said, he wastrying to commit suicide why would he shoot himself in the throat? If he wasn’t,why would he shoot himself in the throat? If he didn’t have a gun, how did heshoot himself at all? One minute he was in hospital with a throat wound thatwould likely mean he couldn’t speak and the next the police are telling us howhe was confirming their official story. It was laughable. Once a suspect istaken into custody this is usually the end of any alternative version of eventsanyway because of the sophistication of modern-day mind control which canconvince even the most innocent that they are guilty. There are so manyquestions that still have not been answered and they won’t be by the authoritiesbecause once their story is unleashed nothing is allowed to question orcontradict it; but it is obvious from the information that I have laid out herealone that a very different version of events is being hidden.Another strange ‘coincidence’ was that Sunil Tripathi, a 22-year-old formerBoston student named as a suspect on the 4chan imageboard website, was founddead in the Providence River a week after the bombings. He had been missingsince mid-March. Then, on May 22nd, an FBI agent shot dead 27-year-old IbragimTodashev during an interview in Florida in which he was being questioned abouthis friendship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The FBI said that Todashev became violentand attacked the agent with a knife. It was later admitted that there was noknife. His father, Abdul-Baki Todashev, showed the media images of his son inthe mortuary sent to him by a friend in the United States. Todashev had beenshot at least seven times and one of the bullet wounds was in the back of thehead. It was an execution by the state, nothing less. Todashev had reportedlyspoken with Tamerlan Tsarnaev a week before the bombings. What did he know thatthe authorities were desperate for the public not to know?This Problem-Reaction-Solution attack in Boston was immediately used to pressfor increased security at public events including a ban on backpacks. New YorkMayor Michael Bloomberg (Rothschild Zionist) exploited the Boston attack tojustify a massive increase in surveillance cameras. He said: ‘You’re never goingto know where all of our cameras are and that’s one of the ways you deterpeople; they just don’t know whether the person sitting next to you is justsomebody sitting there or a detective watching.’ The classic Big Brothersociety. They don’t mention that Boston has a network of surveillance camerasthat failed to stop the bombings. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said ofthose who want their privacy protected: ‘The privacy issue has really been takenoff the table … I don’t think people are concerned about it. I think peopleaccept it in a post-9/11 world.’ No, more like they are having it imposed uponthem no matter what they think. As Bloomberg said about introducing surveillancedrones: ‘Get used to it’. The arrogance of this tiny, tiny minority that I callRothschild Zionists knows no bounds. There was another great bonus for theglobal conspiracy with the Boston attack in that the search for DzhokharTsarnaev allowed them to get Americans used to the kind of martial law that isplanned for the whole country and to test public reaction to it with armedpolice/military swarming the area forcing their way into homes at gunpoint andordering people to stay indoors. The crowds chanting ‘USA, USA’ in response to apolice operation that had turned Boston into a city under military control wasnot encouraging to say the least and so many continue to live in child-likeselfdelusion in the face of what is happening. But there was much to make usoptimistic, too. These staged events are becoming so much more difficult to sellcompared with before as people in ever-increasing numbers get the message aboutProblem-Reaction-Solution, how it works and to what end. Boston was theirhardest sell yet because of this emerging awareness and it can only get evenharder from hereon as news of the global agenda expands further into publicconsciousness.The constant connection – Intelligence agencies and terrorismIt was no surprise to experienced researchers that those alleged to havemurdered British soldier Lee Rigby near his barracks in Woolwich, London, inMay, 2013 would appear to have been closely tracked by the British security andintelligence networks and, according to a long-time friend, one of them waspressured by MI5 to become a spy and informant. Michael Adebolajo and MichaelAdebowale, aged 28 and 22, are said to have struck off-duty Lee Rigby with a carand then attacked him with a cleaver. The images in Figure 12 were capturedafter the incident and many have pointed out the remarkable absence of blood onthe men’s clothes from such a gruesome attack. The two men did not try toescape, but just waited for the police to arrive while talking to people in thestreet. Adebolajo is seen to say:[../Images/00335.jpg]Figure 12:> The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying> daily by British soldiers, and this British soldier is one, is a eye for a eye> [sic] and a tooth for a tooth. By Allah, we swear by the Almighty Allah we> will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone.> So what if we want to live by the Sharia in Muslim lands. Why does that mean> you must follow us and chase us and call us extremists and kill us? Rather you> are extreme. You are the ones. When you drop a bomb, do you think it hits one> person or rather your bomb wipes out a whole family. This is the reality …A common theme among Adebolajo’s friends and associates is that he was apleasant, kind, friendly and happy-go-lucky person until a visit to Kenya in2010 when he was arrested, tortured and sexually abused by Kenyan troops.Adebolajo said the troops told him that the torture and abuse was being done atthe request of the British authorities. Ibrahim Hassan (also known as AbuNusaybah), a childhood friend of Adebolajo, said in a letter to the UKparliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee:> ... the first factor was the systematic torture and sexual abuse he was> subjected to by Kenyan troops which he believed was at the behest of British> Intelligence. Michael was told by his captors that this action by them was at> the behest of UK authorities. He could not forget or forgive them for this> connivance in this brutal treatment of him, when all he was trying to do was> build a new life for himself outside of the UK.Hassan said that he was ‘witness to the fact that the Michael I knew ceased toexist after his treatment in Kenya.’ What is being described here is the classicsoftening up and compartmentalisation of the mind associated with trauma-basedmind control which I have detailed extensively in my books. Ibrahim Hassan alsosaid that he was told by Adebolajo that when he returned from Kenya to the UK hewas subjected to further harassment and intimidation by the security services topressure him into working for them as an agent. Family members have said thesame. His brother-in-law Abu Zuybyr said the intelligence services harassedAdebolajo to spy on Muslim clerics and become an informer. ‘That is what[Adebolajo’s] family is saying: that the secret service pushed him over theedge.’ Then it emerged that Michael Adebolajo’s 26-year-old brother, Jeremiah,who uses the name Abul Jaleel, was being paid by MI6 to spy for them in theMiddle East while working as an English teacher in Saudi Arabia. He is said tohave been pressured by the security services to become their spy and toencourage Michael Adebolajo to do the same with regard to MI5. The depth ofdepravity that controls the intelligence services in Britain, America and allover the world is beyond belief and they have a policy of giving their Muslimtargets the choice of working for them as informants or being falsely accused ofterrorism. Once again we have a link in Woolwich between an act of violence andintelligence agencies, just as we have with Boston and so many others. IbrahimHassan sent his letter to the parliamentary committee via his lawyer because hewas arrested immediately after recording an interview with the BBC Newsnightprogramme in which he exposed the Adebolajo-MI5 connection. They could not gethim off the streets quick enough once he was exposing the MI5 background toMichael Adebolajo and at Hassan’s court hearing on May 26th, 2013 to extend histime in custody his barrister asked if MI5 had ordered his arrest. The policerefused to deny this. Moazzem Begg, chairman of the London-based human rightsorganisation, Cage Prisoners, said:> Is it a coincidence that Abu Nusaybah [Ibrahim Hassan] was arrested yesterday> at the BBC studios right after he gave an interview which described the MI5> harassment and torture in Kenya – which British Intelligence knew about and> quite possibly was complicit in – of Michael Adebolajo?With the circumstances before us that question answers itself. Throughout theworld the intelligence services are interweaved with terrorist organisations andthey created most of them. Michael Adebolajo, who comes from a staunch Christianfamily, converted to Islam in 2003 and is said to have been ‘radicalised’ byIslamic preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad who is reported to have links to BritishIntelligence. Bakri Muhammad was a member of theBritain-America-Israel-controlled Muslim Brotherhood and he established thesince-banned organisation in Britain called ‘Al Muhajiroun’. Michael Adebolajobecame a supporter and activist in this group and, according to insider sourceslike former US Justice Department prosecutor and terrorism expert John Loftus,Al Muhajiroun was closely associated with Britain’s MI6. Loftus told Fox News in2005:> ...back in the late 1990s, the leaders all worked for British intelligence in> Kosovo. Believe it or not, British intelligence actually hired some Al-Qaeda> guys to help defend the Muslim rights in Albania and in Kosovo. That’s when> Al-Muhajiroun got started.Bakri Muhammad ran the London-based international Islamist party Hizb ut-Tahrir(HuT) from 1986 to 1996 and this has been widely connected by researchers toMI6. It was banned for being a terrorist organisation in Britain in 2003 and inmany Muslim countries for plotting military coups against the incumbent regimes.HuT is reported to be linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, the front for MI6 andthe CIA used destabilise governments in the Middle East (see ‘Arab Spring’). DrReza Shihata, former Deputy Chief of Mission at the Egyptian Embassy inPakistan, said that he had uncovered links between the Brotherhood and the CIA.Former Justice Department prosecutor John Loftus also revealed that HaroonRashid Aswat, the alleged ‘mastermind’ (nonsense) behind the London bombings of2005, was a British Intelligence asset. Everywhere you look the same connectionsappear between terrorists and ‘security’ agencies. This explains the seriouslynon-Islamic lifestyles and backgrounds of supposedly radical Muslims. MohammedAtta, the ‘lead hijacker’ (nonsense) in the 9/11 attacks, was running drugs forthe CIA and Pakistan military intelligence through Venice airport in Floridawhere several of the fantasy ‘hijackers’ were said to have trained as pilots. Healso had a non-Muslim girlfriend who said that he had an endless supply ofcocaine and that his favourite food was pork chops. How very Islamic. MohammedAtta and other ‘hijackers’ visited Las Vegas at least six times where theydrank, gambled and enjoyed the company of lap dancers. Omar Bakri Muhammad,apparently a mentor to Woolwich suspect Michael Adebolajo, called the 9/11 fakehijackers ‘the magnificent 19’ which confirms that he was either clueless aboutwhat really happened that day or he was playing his part in promoting the coverstory. Bakri’s daughter works as a topless poledancer in London clubs and the‘Islamic extremist’, who now lives in Lebanon, is reported to have paid forbreast enlargements to launch her career. What a joke it all is. One-timeDirector General of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, a lady that a former associatehas told me a lot about, said the public had to spy on each other and be the‘eyes’ of the authorities in the aftermath of Woolwich –Problem-Reaction-Solution. The enemy was everywhere and further attacks wereinevitable unless the country became a ‘police state’, she said. But then thatis the whole idea. Rimington went on:> The community has the responsibility to act as the eyes and ears, as they did> during the war … where there were all these posters up saying the walls have> ears and the enemy is everywhere.> There have often been indications in the community, whether it’s Muslim or> anywhere else, that people are becoming extremists and spouting hate phrases.I had better report Blair, Bush, Obama and Cameron then for their mass murderextremism and their spouting of hate phrases about Hussein, Gaddafi, Assad andAhmadinejad. But, of course, when the state is the terrorist its terrorism isonly fighting terrorism. Inversion, inversion, inversion. Tony Blair said afterthe Woolwich attacks that ‘there is a problem within Islam’. Only a psychopathicnarcissist like Blair could have the nerve to say that while swimming in theblood of the millions whose death and suffering he sanctioned as British PrimeMinister.The veil is liftingPeople have been shocked during the production stage of this book at therevelations from intelligence insiders of the breathtaking scale of globalsurveillance by organisations like the US National Security Agency (NSA), butwhat whistleblowers like NSA contractor Edward Snowden and others have revealedabout the enormity of human surveillance worldwide was not a revelation to me.Research these subjects at any length and to any depth and you will know thatthere are two worlds, the seen and the unseen, operating in the same ‘space’while masquerading as one. First there is the world that humanity in generalexperiences as the seen. This is where governments are chosen by the ballot boxthrough something called ‘democracy’ and from this come laws and regulationsthat apply to everyone, including governments, intelligence agencies, lawenforcement, military, and so on. This world doesn’t really exist in any formexcept in theory and the structure of government and ‘democracy’ in all itsexpressions is there to control the population, not to hold itself to account.The ‘laws’ apply only to the ‘little people’, with increasingly rare exceptions,while the other world does as it likes.It is the realm of Satanism, secret societies, semi-secret groups, banks andcorporations that dictate public policy and the direction of human society byimposing the laws from the shadows which, in the world of the seen, appear onthe surface to be the work of politicians accountable to The People through opendebate and elections. In this realm of the unseen there are no laws or checksand balances on unfettered power. It is, after all, the realm created byunfettered power to infinitely expand unfettered power. In short, it doeswhatever it wants without challenge or accountability, except in the sense thatlower levels of the unseen are strictly accountable to those above them. Theunseen hierarchy is accountable only to itself and not at all to the hierarchyof the seen that we see as governments, intelligence agencies, law enforcementand military. Once you realise this there is nothing in theme that even aninsider like Edward Snowden can tell you that is not already obvious, a gimme.The fact that so many – not least in the media – have reacted with shock andoutrage shows just how firewalled the unseen is from the perceptions of theseen. I share the outrage, but not the shock.There is, however, much to be encouraged about, too. The very fact that theseinsiders are breaking ranks for a start and there are going to be many more asthey see that staying silent is not an option given the direction the world isbeing taken and to what end. The dot-connecting of the alternative media ishaving a powerful effect by showing those on the inside how what they know anddo connects with what others know and do to create a highly sinister pattern andpicture. It is pulling down the walls of compartmentalisation and that is whythe forces of suppression are now in such a panic.The dam is cracking and this is just the start."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00036.jpg]Alexander, Dr Eben: Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife(Piatkus, 2012).Allan, D S and Delair, J B: When the Earth Nearly Died When the Earth NearlyDied (Gateway Books, 1995).Atzmon, Gilad: The Wandering Who?
