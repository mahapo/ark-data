Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi illustrate the interplayof nature and nurture using cutting-edge genetic science and argue persuasivelythat adapting one’s lifestyle can maximize the potential to transcend theinherited susceptibilities handed down to us from our parents.”—James Gusella, Ph.D., director, Center for Human Genetic Research,Massachusetts General Hospital“Once thought to be the domain of genes, the control of health and behavior isnow dynamically linked to the environment and, more important, our perception ofthe environment. Super Genes, by Deepak Chopra and Rudy Tanzi, is aparadigm-shattering synthesis of epigenetic science that offers aneasy-to-understand explanation of the mechanisms by which consciousness andenvironment control our genetic activity. Drs. Chopra and Tanzi’s contributionis a valuable resource that empowers us to become the masters of our fate ratherthan the ‘victims’ of our heredity.”—Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D., epigenetic scientist and bestselling author of TheBiology of Belief, Spontaneous Evolution, and The Honeymoon Effect“The concept that biology is destiny is one of the most pathological and toxicexaggerations to emerge during the entire scientific era. This hard-corematerialistic view has been a kind of psychological enslavement that has pushedmany people into nihilism and despair. In Super Genes, Drs. Deepak Chopra andRudolph E. Tanzi discuss new evidence that our genes are not our masters, butthey respond in large measure to our choices and behaviors. The resulting viewhonors not just the body but the mind and spirit as well—a vision that is asbright and hopeful as the old view was morbid and depressing. Super Genes is animportant book. It will empower anyone who reads it, because it expands our viewof what it means to be human.”—Larry Dossey, M.D., author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of aGreater Consciousness and Why It Matters“Super Genes demolishes the myth that our genes determine our fate. DeepakChopra and Rudy Tanzi explain in breathtaking detail the magic of how our diet,our lifestyle, our thoughts, and even our gut bacteria or microbiome ‘talk’ toour genes, regulating which genes get turned on or off, or turned up or down,influencing every aspect of our health. This is essential reading for anyoneinterested in turning on their health, weight loss, happiness, and longevitygenes!”—Mark Hyman, M.D., director, Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine,and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller The Blood Sugar Solution“We used to think everything about us was either our genetics or ourenvironment. But in Super Genes, Deepak Chopra and Rudi Tanzi adeptly teach usthat it’s all about both—how tightly they are intertwined. And what we can doabout it.”—Eric Topol, M.D., author of The Patient Will See You Now, and professor ofgenomics, the Scripps Research Institute“I have always been far more interested in how we can all optimize our health,as opposed to simply preventing disease. Both are important, no doubt, butteaching people how they can be better—better, faster, stronger, happier—is somuch more inspiring. It is what I loved about Super Brain, the first book Deepakand Rudolph wrote, and they now have a muscular follow-up with Super Genes. Inmany ways, Super Genes is the prequel to Super Brain, because it peers down intothe very essence of who we are, what comprises us as human beings, and how muchof what we experience is preordained destiny vs. being in our own control. Theanswer to these questions will inspire you.“We cannot be content to simply blame our genes, but to realize that we cancontrol this blueprint for life and the way our body interprets it.“Flawlessly weaving together the complicated science of genetics with thetouching stories of very real people, my friends Deepak and Rudolph have writtena book that you won’t put down. You will find yourself scribbling furious notesand sharing your new wisdom with the people you love. First they gave us all theability to have Super Brains, and now they have done the same with our SuperGenes.”—Sanjay Gupta, M.D., neurosurgeon and author of Chasing Life, Cheating Death,and Monday Mornings“A groundbreaking and eye-opening account of recent discoveries in two newfields—epigenetics and microbiomics—weaved with practical insights to optimizeour own wellness and longevity. Rudy Tanzi and Deepak Chopra, renowned pioneersin their respective fields, have written one of the most important health booksof the year.”—Murali Doraiswamy, M.D., professor of psychiatry and medicine, Duke University“Super Genes will take you on an exciting journey of discovery about the waysgenetic expression can be modified by simple lifestyle changes and even by howyou use your mind. The essential message of this important book is that yourgenes alone do not determine your destiny. You can learn how to influence themto enjoy better health and optimum well-being. I recommend it.”—Andrew Weil, M.D., author of Healthy Aging and Spontaneous Happiness“Our genes are a predisposition, but they are not our fate. The biologicalmechanisms that affect our health and well-being are often extraordinarilydynamic—for better and for worse. When we eat well, move more, stress less, andlove more, our bodies often have a remarkable ability to transform and heal.Super Genes is a superb contribution to our growing knowledge that mind, brain,genome, and microbiome can act as a single system. Drs. Chopra and Tanzicontinue to make pioneering contributions that are bringing integrative medicineinto the mainstream. Highly recommended!”—Dean Ornish, M.D., founder and president, Preventive Medicine ResearchInstitute, and clinical professor of medicine, University of California, SanFrancisco“Chopra and Tanzi have written what will be a life-changing book for many. Itwill completely change your perspective on how our genes influence us and how wecan influence them. Well researched, elegant, and engaging, Super Genes furthersour understanding of the potential that lies inside all of us. This is amust-read.”—Steven R. Steinhubl, M.D., director, Digital Medicine, Scripps TranslationalScience Institute“This book brings you the sanest, most effective way to participate positivelyin the very evolution of our whole human species! Deepak and Rudy don’t justbring you the wonderful news that you are not a victim of your genes, but divestraight into putting you in charge of your own health through easy, simple,inexpensive changes in your lifestyle that will improve your genome as theybring you, and even your unborn descendants, vibrant good health!”—Elisabet Sahtouris, evolutionary biologist and futurist and author of Gaia’sDance: The Story of Earth & Us“Super Genes is a superb contribution to our growing knowledge that mind, brain,genome, and microbiome are a single system. Congratulations to both Rudy andDeepak.”—Keith L. Black, M.D., professor and chair, Department of Neurosurgery atCedars-Sinai Medical Center, and author of Brain Surgeon: A Doctor’s InspiringEncounters with Mortality and Miracles“Genetics is a two-way street.

Almost no one would say“my genes.” And with good reason—we’ve been taught that genes are fixed andunchangeable: What you were born with is what you will keep for life. If youhappen to be an identical twin, both of you will have to settle for identicalgenes, no matter how good or bad they are. The popular notion of fixed genes ispart of our day-to-day language. Why are some people gifted with more beauty andbrains than the norm? They have good genes. Why, on the other hand, does afamous Hollywood celebrity undergo a double mastectomy without any sign ofdisease? It’s the threat of bad genes, the inheritance of a strongpredisposition to the cancer that runs in her family. The public is frightened,and yet the media doesn’t really communicate how rare such a threat actually is.It’s time to explode such rigid notions. Your genes are fluid, dynamic, andresponsive to everything you think and do. The news everyone should hear is thatgene activity is largely under our control. That’s the breakthrough ideaemerging from the new genetics and also the basis for this book.A café jukebox may stand in the corner and never move, but it still playshundreds of songs. The music of your genes is similar, constantly producing avast array of chemicals that are encoded messages. We are just discovering howpowerful these messages are. By focusing on your own gene activity throughconscious choices, you canImprove your mood level, staving off anxiety and depressionResist yearly colds and fluReturn to normal sound sleepGain more energy and resist chronic stressBe rid of persistent aches and painsRelieve your body of a wide range of discomfortsSlow the aging process and potentially reverse itNormalize your metabolism—the best way to lose weight and keep it offDecrease your risk of cancerIt was long suspected that genes could be involved when bodily processes gowrong. We now know that genes are definitely involved in making them go right.The entire mind-body system is regulated by gene activity, often in surprisingways. The genes in your intestines, for example, are sending messages about allkinds of things that would apparently have nothing to do with a function asmundane as digestion. These messages concern your moods, the efficiency of yourimmune system, and your susceptibility to disorders closely related to digestion(e.g., diabetes and irritable bowel syndrome), but also those very distantlyrelated, such as hypertension, Alzheimer’s disease, and autoimmune disordersfrom allergies to chronic inflammation.Every cell in your body is talking to many other cells via genetic messages, andyou need to be part of the conversation. Your lifestyle leads to helpful orharmful genetic activity. In fact, the actions of your genes can potentially bealtered by any strong experience throughout your life. So identical twins,despite being born with the same genes, show extremely different gene expressionas adults. One twin may be obese, the other lean; one may be schizophrenic andthe other not; one may die long before the other. All of these differences areregulated by gene activity.One reason we called this book Super Genes is to raise the bar for what youexpect your genes to do for you. The mind-body connection isn’t like afootbridge connecting two banks of a river. It’s much more like a telephoneline—many telephones lines, in fact—teeming with messages. And each message—astiny as drinking orange juice in the morning, or eating an apple with the peelon, or lowering the noise level at work, or taking a walk before bedtime—isbeing received by the entire system. Every cell is eavesdropping on what youthink, say, and do.Optimizing your gene activity would be reason enough to throw away theself-defeating notion of good genes versus bad genes. But in reality, ourunderstanding of the human genome—the sum total of all your genes—has vastlyexpanded over the last two decades. After almost twenty years of research anddevelopment the Human Genome Project ended in 2003 with a complete map of the 3billion chemical base pairs—the alphabet of the code of life—strung along thedouble helix of DNA in every cell. Suddenly human existence is headed fortotally new destinations. It’s as if someone handed us a map of an undiscoveredcontinent. In a world where we think there’s little left to explore, the humangenome is a new frontier.Let us impress upon you how expanded the field of genetics really is today: Youpossess a super genome that extends almost infinitely beyond the old textbookideas of good and bad genes. This super genome is made up of three components:1. The roughly 23,000 genes you inherited from your parents, together with the97 percent of the DNA that is located between those genes on the strands of thedouble helix.2. The switching mechanism that resides in every strand of DNA, allowing it tobe turned on or off, up or down, the way a dimmer switch turns the lights up anddown. This mechanism is controlled principally by your epigenome, including thebuffer of proteins that encloses DNA like a sleeve. The epigenome is as dynamicand alive as you are, responding to experience in complex and fascinating ways.3. The genes contained in the microbes (tiny microscopic living organisms likebacteria) that inhabit your intestine, mouth, and skin, but primarily yourintestine. These “gut microbes” vastly outnumber your own cells. The bestestimate is that we harbor 100 trillion gut microbes, comprising between 500 and2,000 species of bacteria. They are not foreign invaders. We evolved with thesemicrobes over millions of years, and today you wouldn’t be able to healthilydigest your food, resist disease, or counter a host of chronic disorders fromdiabetes to cancer without them.All three components of the super genome are you. They are your building blocks,sending instructions throughout your body at this very minute. You cannot graspwho you are, in fact, without embracing your super genome. How super genes gottogether to form the mind-body system constitutes the most exciting explorationin present-day genetics. New findings are emerging in a flood of knowledge thataffects all of us. It’s changing the way we live, love, and understand our placein the universe.The new genetics can be simplified in a single phrase: we are learning how tomake our genes help us. Instead of allowing your bad genes to hurt you and yourgood genes to give you a break in life, which used to be the prevailing view,you should think of the super genome as a willing servant who can help youdirect the life you want to live. You were born to use your genes, not the otherway around. We aren’t indulging in wish fulfillment here—far from it. The newgenetics is all about how to alter gene activity in a positive direction.Super Genes gathers the most important findings we have today and then expandsupon them. We combine decades of experience as one of the world’s leadinggeneticists and one of the world’s most acclaimed leaders in mind-body medicineand spirituality. We may come from different worlds, and we spend our workingdays in divergent ways, Rudy doing cutting-edge research into the cause andpotential cure of Alzheimer’s disease, Deepak teaching about mind, body, andspirit to hundreds of audiences a year.However, we’re united in a passion for transformation, whether the roots ofchange are found in the brain or in the gene. Our previous book, Super Brain,used the best neuroscience to show how the brain can be healed and renewed,optimizing its daily function to create much better outcomes in people’s lives.Our new book deepens the story—you could call it a prequel to SuperBrain—because the brain depends on the DNA in every nerve cell to do the amazingthings it does every day. We are taking the same message—you are the user ofyour brain, not the other way around—and extending it to the genome. Lifestyleis the domain where transformation takes place, whether we’re talking aboutsuper brain or super genes. There is the possibility, through simple lifestylechanges, of ending up as a person who is activating an enormous amount ofuntapped potential.The most exciting news of all is that the conversation between body, mind, andgenes can be transformed. This transformation goes far beyond prevention, evenbeyond wellness, to a state we call radical well-being. This book explains everyaspect of radical well-being, showing how up-to-date science either totallysupports it or strongly suggests what we should be doing if we want the mostlife-supporting response from our genes.The terms good genes and bad genes are misleading because they feed into abigger misconception: biology as destiny. As we’ll explain, there are no goodversus bad genes. All genes are good. It is mutation—variations in the DNAsequence or structure—that can turn genes bad. Other mutations can also turngenes “good.” Disease-associated gene mutations that will actually destine aperson to acquire a disease with certainty in the span of a normal life spanamount to only 5 percent of all disease-associated mutations. This is aminuscule portion of the three million or so DNA variations in each person’ssuper genome. As long as you keep thinking in terms of good genes and bad genes,you’ve imprisoned yourself in bad, outmoded beliefs. Biology is being allowed todefine who you are. In modern society, where people have more freedom of choicethan ever before, it’s ironic that genetics became so deterministic. “My genesdid it” became the blanket answer to why someone overeats, suffers fromdepression, breaks the law, has a psychotic break, or even believes in God.If the new genetics is teaching us anything, it’s about nature cooperating withnurture. Your genes can predispose you to obesity or depression or type 2diabetes, but this is like saying that a piano predisposes you to play wrongnotes. The possibility exists, yet far more important is all the good music apiano—and a gene—are capable of.We offer you this book in the spirit of expanding your well-being, not becausethere are so many wrong notes to avoid, but because there’s so much beautifulmusic left to be composed. Super genes hold the key to personal transformation,which has suddenly become far more attainable—and desirable—than ever before."},{"pageContent":"WHY SUPER GENES?AN URGENT ANSWERThe purpose of this book is to raise everyday well-being to the level of radicalwell-being. Such a goal requires a journey of transformation through anunderstanding of our own genetics. This fascinating field of inquiry has led toa flood of exciting findings, and more appear every day. Human DNA has many moresecrets to reveal. Yet a tipping point has already been reached. It has becomeblindingly clear that the human body is not what it seems to be.Imagine you are standing in front of a mirror: what do you see? The obviousanswer is a living object, a moving machine of flesh and blood. This object isyour home base and protective shelter. It faithfully takes you where you want togo and does what you want to do. Without a physical body, life would have nofoundation. But what if everything you assumed about your body were an illusion?What if that thing you see in the mirror isn’t a thing at all?In reality, your body is like a river, constantly flowing and changing.Your body is like a cloud, a swirl of energy that is 99 percent empty space.Your body is like a brilliant idea in the cosmic mind, an idea that tookbillions of years of evolution to construct.These comparisons aren’t just images—they are realities pointing totransformation. Right now, the body as a physical thing fits in with everydayexperience. To paraphrase Shakespeare, if you cut yourself, do you not bleed?Yes, of course, because the physical side of life is totally necessary. But thephysical side comes second. Without those other possibilities—the body as idea,energy cloud, and constant change—your body would fly away, vanishing into arandom swirl of atoms.Once you see past the facade of that image in the mirror, the big story begins.Behind the mirror, so to speak, genetics has been unfolding the story of life instages, punctuated by the 1953 breakthrough that revealed DNA’s double helix, atwisted ladder with billions of chemical rungs. In the past ten years, however,the story has exploded, thanks to the discovery of how active our genes reallyare. Everywhere in the body, a cell puts the secret of life into practice:It knows what’s good for it and seizes upon the good.It knows what’s bad for it and avoids the bad.It sustains its survival from moment to moment with total focus.It monitors the well-being of every other cell.It adapts to reality without resistance or judgment.It draws upon the deepest resources of Nature’s intelligence.Can we, the summation of all those cells, say the same for ourselves? Do we eattoo much, overindulge in alcohol, put up with pummeling stress, and robourselves of sleep? No healthy cell would make such choices.So why the disconnect? Nature designed us to be as healthy as our cells. Thereis no reason not to be. Cells naturally make the right choices at every moment.How can we do the same?What’s so exciting about recent research is that gene activity can be greatlyimproved, and when this happens a state of radical well-being is possible. Whatmakes it radical is that it goes far beyond conventional prevention. The veryfoundation of chronic disease is being exposed by the new genetics. We areseeing how lifestyle choices made years ago profoundly affect how the bodyoperates today, for both good and ill. Your genes are eavesdropping on everychoice you make.We hold that radical well-being is an urgent need, and we believe wholeheartedlythat we can convince you of this. Unknown to the vast majority of people,there’s a hole in conventional well-being, a hole big enough that acceleratedaging, chronic disease, obesity, depression, and addiction have managed to slipthrough. All efforts to counter these threats have been only half successful atbest. A new model is needed. Here’s how one woman experienced this need.RUTH ANN’S STORYWhen Ruth Ann developed pain in both hips, she initially shrugged it off. Atfifty-nine, she prided herself on how well she was managing her body. She hadsuperb impulse control, eating the right foods without the snacking and guiltydashes to the fridge for ice cream at midnight that gradually put on pounds. Shedidn’t smoke and rarely drank. Her cupboard held a stock of vitamins andnutritional supplements. Her exercise routine went beyond the recommendedminimum of four or five periods of vigorous activity per week—she spent twohours at the gym every day. As a result, on the eve of turning sixty, Ruth Anncould show off a perfect figure, which had been her main focus all along.The arrival of pain in her hips two years earlier was annoying, but she didn’tlet it affect her exercise routine. Gradually the pain became chronic; it spikedwhenever she ran on the treadmill. Eventually she needed to lie down for an hourevery afternoon to allow the pain to subside. Ruth Ann went to her doctor.X-rays were taken, and the news was bad: She had degenerative osteoarthritis.Sooner or later, the doctor informed her, she was facing a hip replacement.The cause of arthritis, of which there are many types, is unknown, but Ruth Annhas her own explanation. “I shouldn’t have been such an exercise fanatic. Ipushed myself too hard, and now I’m paying the price.” She felt defeated. In hermind, she had been doing all the right things to postpone “turning into an oldlady.” This was her biggest fear. Now, as if tiny goblins were coming out of thecloset, the symptoms of accelerated aging were upon her. Her figure is that of athirty-year-old, but appearances deceive. She feels tired for no reason. Hersleep and appetite have turned irregular, with nights of severe insomnia thatcan go on for several weeks. Small stresses give rise to low-level anxiety. RuthAnn has never felt helpless before. Whenever she has a mental image of herselfas an “old lady,” she wishes she could run back to the gym and get on thetreadmill again.The bottom line is that Ruth Ann feels her body has betrayed her. Yet considerhow the situation looks from a cell’s point of view. A cell doesn’t push itselfbeyond its limits. It heeds the slightest sign of damage and rushes to repairit. A cell obeys the natural cycle of rest and activity. It follows the deepunderstanding of life embedded in its DNA. By conventional standards, Ruth Anndid all the right things, yet at a deeper level she was disconnected from herbody’s intelligence.We have so much that’s positive to tell you that we will state the negative sidejust once: The two major threats to well-being—illness and aging—are constantlypresent. Out of sight, without your knowing it, your present good health isbeing silently undermined. Abnormal processes are taking place in everyone’sbody at a microscopic level. Anomalies inside a cell that affect only a clusterof molecules or the shape of one enzyme are virtually undetectable. You can’tfeel them as an ache or pain or even as vague discomfort. Such abnormalities cantake years to develop into even minor symptoms. But the day will arrive when ourbody starts to tell us a story we don’t want to hear, just as Ruth Ann’s bodydid.This book tells you how to avert that day for years, or even decades, to come.The possibility of radical well-being is very real, and the most excitingdevelopments are merely a prelude to a revolution in self-care. Become a pioneerin that revolution. It’s the most significant step you can take in shaping thefuture you desire for body, mind, and spirit. Your genes play a part in all ofthese areas, as we’re about to show you.FROM GENES TO SUPER GENEThe threats that undermine your well-being are persistent. Even if you consideryourself safe right now, how secure is your future? Genes can help answer thatquestion. They can lead you to make life-supporting choices while correcting thewrong choices made in the past. The first step is to focus on the cell. Yourbody has approximately 50 trillion to 100 trillion cells (estimates varywidely). There is no process—from thinking a thought to having a baby, fromfending off invading bacteria to digesting a ham sandwich—that isn’t tied to aspecialized activity in your cells. A cell must look to its DNA to keep itperfectly functioning, because DNA, as the “brain” of the cell, is ultimately incharge of every process. In a healthy person, this activity occurs perfectlymore than 99.9 percent of the time. It’s the tiny exceptions, amounting to themerest fraction of 0.1 percent, that can cause trouble.The DNA that’s neatly tucked inside each cell is something magnificent, acomplex combination of chemicals and proteins that holds the entire past,present, and future of all life on our planet. Bacteria are essential to thebody, too, with trillions of them lining the gut and the surface of the skin.These form colonies known as the microbiome. It’s long been known that bacteriain the intestines make digestion possible. But recently the microbiome hasassumed much greater importance. For one thing, there’s the sheer number ofbacteria involved, which amount to something like 90 percent of the cells in thebody. Even more crucial, bacterial DNA became part of human DNA over the courseof billions of years. It is estimated that 90 percent of the genetic informationinside us is bacterial—our ancestors were microbes, and they are, in many ways,still present in the structure of our cells.In fact, your body may contain 100 trillion or more bacteria (a very roughestimate). In isolation, they would weigh somewhere between three and fivepounds in dry weight. If we keep score by the number of different genes youpossess, it would be about 23,000 genes inside your cells and 1 million genesfor all these various microbes. In a sense we are sophisticated hosts for themicro-organisms that colonize us. The implications for medicine and health arepotentially staggering and are just now being explored. One conclusion isinescapable: the human genome, having expanded tenfold, has become a supergenome. Because of the microbes now being wrapped into the story, Earth’s2.8-billion-year-old genetic legacy is present inside each of us, here and now.Much of the original stuff, genetically speaking, is still propagating insidethe cells of your body.The fact that DNA stores the entire history of life gives it tremendousresponsibility. One slip, and an entire species can be wiped out. Realizing thisfact, geneticists spent many decades thinking about DNA as a stable chemical,its biggest threat being the instability created when a mistake slips by thebody’s defenses. But now we realize that DNA is responsive to everything thathappens in our lives. This opens the door to many new possibilities that scienceis just now beginning to grasp.SASKIA’S STORYSome people find themselves apparently victimized by their genes; others arerescued by them. One woman experienced both. Saskia is in her late forties withadvanced breast cancer that has metastasized to other locations in her body,including her bones. In her most recent battle against the disease, Saskiabypassed chemotherapy in favor of immunotherapy, which aims at increasing thebody’s own immune response. She also decided to spend a week learning how totake care of herself through meditation, yoga, massage, and other complementarytherapies. (The program she attended was given at the Chopra Center. We mentionthis in the spirit of full disclosure, not to take credit for what occurrednext.)Saskia enjoyed the week and came away with a feeling that she could relate toher body in a better way. She appreciated how well she was treated, pointing inparticular to the loving attitude of the massage therapists. At the end of theweek she reported that her bone pain had gone away, and she went home feelingmuch better, emotionally and physically. She recently sent a follow-up e-maildescribing what happened next.> The day after I got home, I had another PET/CT scan. This one was four months> after the last.

One is the standard medicalresponse, which amounts to dismissal.Faced with Saskia’s experience, most oncologists would consider it merelyanother piece of anecdotal evidence that has little bearing on the overallstatistics relating to cancer treatment and survival. Cancer is a numbers game.What happens to thousands of patients tells the tale, not what happens to onepatient. The other attitude to Saskia’s experience is to explore how changes inher situation led to such a remarkable result. Let’s list all the changes sheexperienced that might influence gene expression:Improved attitude toward her disorderIncreased optimismDecreased bone painEmotional support from her husbandNew knowledge about the mind-body connectionNew lifestyle choices added to her daily routine: meditation, yoga, massageBenefits from therapeutic massage and other treatments at the centerThe list looks quite diverse, and only one or two items on it would be foundunder current standard cancer treatments. But there’s a common thread to everyitem. New messages were sent to and from her brain and her genes. If medicinecould decode these messages, we’d get much closer to solving the mystery ofhealing. It can be hard for any physician who is in the business of curing hispatients to admit that the only true healer is the body itself. And how the bodypushes atoms and molecules around to achieve healing—or not—remains a deepmystery.What will happen to Saskia in the coming months and years is unpredictable. Weare not promoting miracle cures in any way, shape, or form. We know full wellthat miracle isn’t a useful term for understanding how the body operates.If you could listen in on the stream of messages received at the genetic levelover the course of a single day, in all likelihood you’d hear the following:Keep doing what you’re doing.Reject or ignore change.Keep problems away from me. I don’t want to know about them.Make my life pleasant.Avoid difficulties and pain.You take care of it. I don’t want to.You aren’t aware that this is what you are telling your genes, over and over,because you don’t put these messages into words like a telegram. But yourintention is clear, and cells respond to what you want and do, not what you say.Each of us is incredibly fortunate that our bodies can run automatically withalmost total perfection for decades at a time. But unless we participate in ourown well-being, sending conscious messages to our genes, running on automaticisn’t good enough. Radical well-being requires conscious choices. When you makethe right choices, your genes will cooperate with whatever you want.This is the new story we want you to follow, and to turn into your own story.When you use your genes for transformation, they become super genes. To guideyou to the goal, the rest of the book is organized into three parts:The Science of Transformation: Here we give you the latest knowledge about thenew genetics and the revolution that is changing biology, evolution,inheritance, and the human body itself.Lifestyle Choices for Radical Well-Being: Here we provide a path for changethat’s both practical and, as much as possible, effortless.Guiding Your Own Evolution: Here we go to the source of all growth and change,which is consciousness. You cannot change what you aren’t aware of, and when youare totally aware, the promise of self-directed transformation comes true.There’s the map. Now we begin the journey. The map has marked out the territoryto be covered, but until you enter the territory, it won’t become real for you.What makes this journey unique is that every step has the power to change yourpersonal reality. Nothing could be more fascinating or more rewarding.Almost a thousand years before DNA revealed its first secret, the mystic Persianpoet Rumi took the same journey. He looked over his shoulder to tell us wherethe road leads:Motes of dust dancing in the lightThat’s our dance, too.We don’t listen inside to hear the music—No matter.The dance of life goes on,And in the joy of the sunIs hiding a God."},{"pageContent":"PART ONE[images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_002_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_002_r1.jpg]THE SCIENCE OF TRANSFORMATION"},{"pageContent":"Thanks to the genetic revolution happening all around us, a new and powerfulally has appeared to aid human happiness. The notion that DNA contains the codeof life isn’t new. But it’s very new to say that you can use your genes. DNAisn’t locked up like a frozen bank account you can’t draw on. As we mentionedearlier, the old belief that “biology is destiny” no longer has the iron grip itonce did. The science of transformation tells a new story, of endlesspossibilities arising from DNA. But to understand that story, we need to look atDNA in all its fantastic complexity.The evolution of all planetary life is condensed inside deoxyribose nucleicacid, to use DNA’s full name. A single strand of DNA is 3 meters long, yet itfits into a space of only 2 to 3 cubic microns in the cell’s nucleus (1 micron =1 millionth of a meter, or roughly 1 millionth of a yard). Only about 3 percentof your DNA is made up of genes, which provide the blueprints for proteins andribonucleic acid (RNA), the facsimile of DNA with which proteins are made orgene activity can be regulated. These, together with fat, water, and a huge hostof friendly microbes, make up your physical body. To a geneticist, you are ahighly complex colony built by DNA, and you are constantly being rebuilt.The body’s superstructure is constantly under revision based on how you liveyour life. What’s known as gene expression—the thousands of chemical productsproduced by genes—is highly malleable. This goes against what most people knowor believe. For instance, how many times have you heard these common phrases:“he’s a chip off the old block”; “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree”;“he’s just like his old man”? Just how true are the old adages? Are we reallyjust the repeat biology and continuing personality of our parents, with a fewvariations thrown in?The new genetics says no. Like your brain, which responds to every choice youmake, your genome is constantly responsive. While the genes your parents passedon to you won’t change into new genes—your unique blueprint stays the samethroughout your lifetime—gene activity changes fluidly and often very quickly.Genes are susceptible to adverse change that can occur as the result of diet,disease, stress, and other factors. That’s why everyday lifestyle choices haverepercussions down to the genetic level. It’s entirely through gene expressionthat the body’s intelligence acquires physical form. What’s even moreastonishing, as we will see, is that how you influence your body today may befelt in the well-being of your children and grandchildren far in the future.Besides DNA, your genome is made up of special proteins that support and“cushion” the DNA. DNA itself is composed of four chemical bases that pair up toform rungs on the double helix.[images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_003_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_003_r1.jpg]These four bases are adenine (abbreviated as A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), andguanine (G). The fact that an alphabet of only four letters is responsible forevery life form on Earth never ceases to astonish. Here’s how complexity arisesfrom simplicity: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Your unique genome carries3 billion of these bases from each parent. The 3 billion bases are divvied upinto 23 chromosomes, which are labeled from 1 to 22 plus the sex chromosomes, Xand Y. The mother always gives her baby an X chromosome. If the father gives a Ychromosome, the baby’s sex will be male; if an X chromosome, the sex will befemale. Since each of your parents gave you 23 chromosomes and 3 billion basesof DNA, your cells contain a total of 46 chromosomes and 6 billion bases. It’spossible to see already how Nature supplied itself with enough buildingmaterials to make a moth, a mouse, or a Mozart out of four letters.The completion of the epoch-making Human Genome Project in 2003, along withsubsequent studies, yielded some surprising, even baffling, results. Forexample, our genome contains roughly 23,000 genes, which is far fewer thananyone supposed. We consider Homo sapiens the most evolved life-form on Earth,but that’s not the same as having more genes—the genome of rice, which containsonly 12 pairs of chromosomes, has as many as 55,000 genes! How as a species dowe get away with fewer genes than a grain of rice? The answer has to do with howefficient our genes have become, and especially how many diverse proteins eachof our genes can make. Gene expression is the key.Compared with the genes in rice, each of our genes can make many differentversions of the same protein, each with a slightly different role in the body,whether it’s building a cell or regulating it. Thanks to the evolution of humanDNA, we get more biological function from fewer genes. Economy of scale,together with redundancy (providing backup so that survival doesn’t depend onone genetic system), is the rule in evolution. Our genes are still evolving toprovide more bang for the buck, so to speak. Moreover, the genes that are mostimportant for the survival of our species have backup copies just in case somebecome corrupted with harmful mutations. Talk about efficient and forwardthinking!BECOMING UNIQUEFrom just these basic facts, it becomes clear that your genetic makeup is uniquein two ways. First, you are unique in the genes you were born with, which no oneelse duplicates unless you are an identical twin. Second, you are unique in whatyour genes are doing right at this moment, because this activity is your story,the book of life that you are the author of. The outcome of ordinary lifestylechoices (Do I go to the gym or stay home? Do I gossip at work or stay out ofother people’s business? Do I donate money to charity or fatten my bank accountinstead?) depends on a single question: What am I asking my genes to do? Theback-and-forth between you and your genome is the determining factor in yourpresent and future.It doesn’t take the whole genome to make you unique, however. In the threebillion bases of DNA that each parent give you, there is a difference once everythousand bases compared with the vast majority of human DNA on the planet. Thismeans that each of your parents passed on roughly three million bases that areknown as DNA variants. A DNA variant can sometimes, but rarely, guarantee acertain disease within a normal life span or simply serve to increase one’s riskwithout guaranteeing the disease. For example, at one of the 3 billion steps ofthe double helix, you may have the base A while your sibling has a T. Thisdifference may result in your being predisposed to developing a disease likeAlzheimer’s or a particular form of cancer, whereas your sibling is not.Contrary to public perception, there is no such thing as a “disease gene.” Allgenes are “good” and provide a normal function needed by the body. It’s thevariants they harbor that can bring problems. On the positive side, somemutations increase resistance to disease. A few rare family strains, forexample, have given almost total immunity to heart disease. No matter how muchfatty food is in their diet, the cholesterol isn’t converted into blood fatsthat line the coronary arteries with plaque. Geneticists have sought out theseisolated populations to discover which variant might have gifted them withresistance to heart disease. By the same token, there are small, rarepopulations in which presenile Alzheimer’s disease affects almost the entirefamily line. They, too, must be studied in an attempt to discover if a geneticsignature is responsible for such a bad outcome.Rudy was fortunate to be intimately involved with the earliest pioneering eventsof the current genetics revolution. When he and his colleague Dr. James Gusellawere still in their early twenties, carrying out the first mapping of the humangenome at Massachusetts General Hospital, they became the first researchers inthe world to locate a disease-causing gene by tracking natural DNA variants inthe genome. In their landmark study, they were able to show that the gene forHuntington’s disease resides on chromosome 4. Huntington’s disease is a fataldisorder in which no clues about the cause were previously available.Some variants are common ones, being present in more than 10 percent of thehuman population, while others are rare, isolated mutations. A genetic variantcan predispose you to certain diseases or behaviors, which is why researchfocuses so intensely on the genetic contribution to Alzheimer’s or depression.Other variants do nothing at all, at least not so far in our evolution. Yourpersonal DNA “fingerprint” is based on the set of variants you inherited. Thesedetermine both the functioning and structure of the hundreds of thousands ofdifferent types of proteins in your body.The number of gene variants that give you a fixed characteristic like blue eyesor blond hair are known as fully penetrant gene variants, and they are in thevast minority, as few as 5 percent of the total. But, in the vast majority ofcases regarding health and personality, your genetic destiny is not set instone. Genes are only one component of the almost infinite interplay of DNA,behavior, and the environment.This fact was underlined by a 2015 study on autism published in the journalNature Medicine. Autism is a baffling disorder because there is no single kindof autism, but rather a wide spectrum of behavior, one that Rudy has worked onextensively over the course of his career. The mass media image of an autisticchild portrays a totally withdrawn state in which the child hardly reacts to anyoutside stimuli. Totally lost in himself, he may rock back and forth or“twiddle” with repeated, robotic gestures. Emotions are stunted or nonexistent.The parents are desperate to find a way to break through the shell.But in some families there are two autistic children, and more often than not,the parents say that their behavior is very different. The new study, whichlooked at the genes of autistic siblings, confirmed this impression. Researcherslooked at eighty-five families in which two children had been diagnosed withautism. It’s possible, through techniques known as genome-wide associationscreens and whole genome sequencing, to look at millions of DNA variants insomeone’s genome. The study targeted 100 specific variants that have beengenetically associated with a greater risk of being autistic. To everyone’ssurprise, only about 30 percent of the autistic siblings shared the samemutation in their DNA, while 70 percent did not. In the shared group, the twoautistic children behaved more or less alike. But in the unshared group, the 70percent, their behavior was as different as any two brothers or sisters. Whatthis suggests is that autism is unique because each person is unique. Even ifscientists examined the genome of thousands and thousands of autistic children,it would be extremely challenging to determine the biological basis of thedisease.Unfortunately, not being able to predict autism in advance brings us back to astate of uncertainty. The chances of having two autistic children in a family offour or more is remote, about 1 in 10,000. As reported in the New York Times, aCanadian couple who already had one severely autistic child and one child withno developmental problems went to the doctor’s with their wish to have a thirdchild. What was the risk that the new baby would be autistic? Hospitals examinethe genome of the oldest affected child to arrive at a prediction. In this case,the couple were told that the chances of having another autistic child wereslim, and in any event, if the child were autistic, it wouldn’t necessarily beto a severe degree.But, in reality, the new baby, which the couple decided to have, did developsevere autism. And the couple report that their two autistic children don’tbehave alike. One is outgoing enough to run up to strangers, while the otherholds back. One loves to play with computers; the other has no interest. Oneruns around, while the other prefers to sit in one place.This is the outcome of diversity. No matter how many genetic samples you takefrom a family line, the next baby to be born will be largely unpredictable, notjust in terms of the risk of autism but in general.While genes clearly determine some things, like the onset of some rare forms ofdisease, most of the time the gene variants that we inherit merely confer asusceptibility toward a disease. The same can be said about geneticpredisposition to certain behavior or personality types. The bottom line is thatwhat we do, what we experience, and how we view the world, along with what weare exposed to in our environment, strongly influence the actual outcome of thegenes we inherit. No one can put a precise number on how much influence you canexert on your gene expression. But there’s no longer any doubt that yourinfluence is important, because it’s in play all the time.It’s now possible to reconstruct the genome of Neanderthals from their remains,but no matter how minutely their genes are examined, the future evolution ofhumans isn’t observable. There is no gene for mathematics or science. If youcompared Mozart’s genes to an amateur violinist’s, you couldn’t detect which onewas the musical genius. Even the most basic predictions are turning out to befar from simple. A pregnant mother might want to know how tall her baby willgrow up to be. There isn’t a single gene for height. So far, it seems that morethan twenty genes are involved. Even if you could predict how these twenty geneswill express themselves, at best you would arrive at 50 percent of the answer.Environmental factors like diet, including both the mother’s diet and thebaby’s, will contribute the other half.Let’s be extremely generous and foresee that genetics, using some sort of supercomputer, might one day handle all the interlocking physical factors. With allthose data, predicting how tall a child will grow up to be would still remainuncertain, because unexpected events always arise. There is a condition known aspsychological dwarfism, for example, in which young children raised in anabusive family situation become stunted in their growth. The mind-bodyconnection has turned a psychological factor, heavily weighted with emotionaldamage, into physical expression. In short, DNA’s alphabet has immeasurable“words” to write, and what they will be is unknown.Sometimes you can witness in action how life experiences alter a person’s DNA.At the end of each chromosome is a section of DNA called a telomere, whichprotects the chromosome from unraveling, like the tip of a shoelace. As we age,our telomeres get shorter with every new division of a cell. After dozens ofdivisions, the protective telomeres become so short that the cell becomessenescent—that is, it stops being able to divide anymore. The death of the cellfollows, along with the absence of new cells to replace it.As it turns out, a person’s experiences also affect telomeres. Scientists atDuke University analyzed DNA samples first from five-year-olds and then againwhen the children were ten. The researchers knew that some of these childrenexperienced physical abuse, bullying, or violent domestic disputes. The ones whoexperienced the most negative and stressful experiences underwent the most rapiderosion of their telomeres. On the other hand, other research indicates thatexercise and meditation have been shown to increase the length of telomeres.The implications are profound. Longevity is not only influenced by the DNAvariants inherited in select genes from your parents. What happens to you todaywill perhaps show up tomorrow in the structure of your chromosomes.One of the most fascinating journeys in the new genetics revolves around lifeexperiences and our genes. Human existence is infinitely complex, which makes ita bewildering task to understand how genes react to daily life. Somehow they do,and we’ve made a start in revealing how they do it—that’s the subject of ournext chapter, which exposes many new possibilities and many mysteries at thesame time."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO CHANGE YOUR FUTURETHE ARRIVAL OF EPIGENETICSWhat enables genes to be just the opposite of fixed—fluid, malleable, andinterconnected—falls under a new field called epigenetics. The Greek word epimeans “upon,” so epigenetics is the study of what is on top of genetics.Physically, epi refers to the sheath of proteins and chemicals that cushion andmodify each strand of DNA. The entire amount of epigenetic modification of theDNA in your body is known as the epigenome. Research on the epigenome isprobably the most exciting part of genetics right now, because it is here thatgenes get switched on and off (like a light switch) and up and down (like athermostat). What if we can control these switches voluntarily? The prospectmakes any adventurous geneticist dizzy with the possibilities.In the 1950s, before it was suspected that the epigenome existed, an Englishbiologist named Conrad Waddington first proposed that human development fromembryo to senior citizen was not completely hardwired in DNA. It took decadesfor the notion of genetic “soft wiring” to catch on, for the now familiar reasonthat genes were thought to be fixed. But eventually it was impossible to ignorecertain anomalies. Identical twins are the classical example, because they areborn with identical genes. If DNA hardwires them, identical twins should bebiologically predestined to be exactly the same all their lives.But they aren’t. Identical twins with virtually the same genomic DNA can be verydifferent based on how they experience the world and how this translates intogene activity. If you know a set of twins, you’ve no doubt heard them expresshow different they feel from each other. It takes more than the same genome tocreate a person. Two identical buildings can be constructed with the sameblueprints but be very different places based on the activities inside.Schizophrenia, for example, is known to have a genetic component, yet if onetwin is schizophrenic, there is only a 50 percent chance that the other will be.This mystery requires further discussion, but you can see the dilemma posed for“biology as destiny.” Epigenetics was born when geneticists focused on thecontrols behind gene expression. It turns out that the flexibility of thesecontrols is one of the most precious of life’s gifts.While all the cells in your body have largely identical DNA sequences andgenetic blueprints, each of the two hundred or so different cell types possessesdifferent structures and roles. Under a microscope, a neuron looks so differentfrom a heart cell that you would hardly expect them to be operated by the sameDNA. Genes are programmed to create a variety of different cells from stemcells, which are the “baby” precursors to mature cells. Stem cells stored inyour bone marrow, for example, replace your blood cells as they die, which isevery few months. The brain has a lifetime supply of stem cells also, whichallows for the generation of new neurons at any stage of life—very good news foran aging population that wants to remain as vital and mentally alert aspossible.A complete understanding of “soft” inheritance is now unfolding, and every stepbrings new surprises. In a 2005 study, Dr. Michael Skinner showed that exposinga pregnant rat to chemicals that impair sexual function resulted in fertilityproblems in offspring onward down to her great-great-grandchildren.Surprisingly, the fertility issues were transmitted to the next generation as a“soft” inheritance by the male rats—via chemical tags (known as methyl groups)on the DNA—along with the DNA sequence of the parents. We know the transmissionwas not a “hard” inheritance because the actual DNA sequence of the transmittedgenes remained the same.[images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_004_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_004_r1.jpg]If DNA is the storehouse for billions of years of evolution, the epigenome isthe storehouse of short-term genetic activities, both very recent and extendingback one, two, or several generations. The fact that memory can be inheritedisn’t new in biology. The bones in the fins of ancestral fish are the same instructure as the bones in the paws of mammals and those in our own hands. Thiskind of memory is definitely hardwired, because evolution from species of fish,bears, raccoons, and Homo sapiens took millions of years to become fixed. What’snew with epigenetics is that the memory of personal experience—yours, yourfather’s, your great-grandmother’s—may be immediately passed on.This brings us to probably the single most important idea in the new geneticrevolution. The epigenome allows for genes to react to experience. They are notisolated but are open to the world just as much as you are. This offers thepossibility that how you react to your daily life, physically andpsychologically, can be passed on through soft inheritance. Simply put, when yousubject your genes to a healthy lifestyle, you are creating super genes. Such apossibility would have seemed like science fiction in previous eras, when it wasset in stone that only DNA is passed down from parents to offspring. But in alandmark study from 2003, scientists took two groups of mice developed with amutant gene that made them be born with both yellow fur and a voraciousappetite. They were thus genetically programmed to overeat to the point ofobesity.The researchers then fed one group of the mice a standard mouse diet, while theother group was given the same food with added nutritional supplements (folicacid, vitamin B12, choline, and the sugar beet product betaine). As it turnedout, the offspring of the mice given the supplements grew up with brown fur andnormal weight despite the mutant gene. Astonishingly, the mutant gene for yellowfur and voracious appetite was overridden by the diet of the mother. In supportof this finding, another study found that mice whose mothers received fewervitamins were more predisposed to obesity and other diseases. Thus a mother’snutritional state may have a more profound impact on her baby than waspreviously believed.The implications of these studies were revolutionary on several fronts. First,the epigenome is always interacting with daily life. What happens to you todayis being recorded at the epigenetic level and—if humans react in the same way asmice—is potentially passed on to future generations. Your own predispositionsmay not belong solely to you, then. They exist on a kind of genetic conveyorbelt on which each generation adds its own contribution.Another study, published in 2005, showed that pregnant women who witnessed the9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center passed on to their babies higher levelsof the stress hormone cortisol. Your mother’s or grandmother’s traumaticchildhood may have changed your own personality toward anxiety and depression.If the genome is the architect’s blueprint of life, the epigenome is theengineer, construction crew, and facilities manager all in one.A DUTCH MYSTERYWe’ve established how epigenetics delves into the changes in gene activitydriven by life experiences. Such changes require no alterations in the DNAsequence itself—that is, no mutations. Some kind of switching mechanism isinvolved instead, but it’s not a simple on or off. The switching mechanism forDNA turns out to be as complicated as human behavior. Think of a common behaviorlike losing your temper. Anger can flick on and off like switching the lights onand off, or it can simmer for a while. Anger can be hidden from view, disguisedby being in control of one’s emotions. Once it flares, anger can range from mildto explosive. Everyone accepts these distinctions, since by common experience weall know hotheads and cool customers. In ourselves we know how to swallow ouranger, yet at the same time we fight against it.Now translate this situation into genetic activity, and all the same variablesapply. Any activity of a gene can be hidden, or turned off. It can be partiallyor totally expressed, going up or down as if controlled by a thermostat. Andjust as anger is intertwined with every other emotion, so is every geneintertwined with every other gene. It’s looking truer and truer that anysubjective experience owes its complexity to a parallel complexity at themicroscopic level.Where does it leave us to know how much we don’t know? If emotions handle genesand genes handle emotions, the circularity might be endless. Having brought usto the control room where all the switching is done, epigenetics still hasn’tput the switches in our hands. Mastering the controls is everyone’s individualresponsibility. Otherwise, genetic changes can be quite drastic when no one isin control. Let’s explore a widely publicized and very puzzling example.Below is a chart of male height in Europe from 1820 to 2013, as compiled bycomputer science researcher Randy Olson. (There are other calculations thatdiffer from the one pictured here, but the overall pattern is the same.) Payparticular attention to where the timeline for the Netherlands goes, shown atthe top right.[images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_005_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_005_r1.jpg]Surprisingly, the Dutch are the tallest men in the world, with an average heightof 185 centimeters (about 6 feet 2 inches). There is reportedly a club inAmsterdam for men who are over 6 feet 10, which isn’t uncommon. A brief walkdown Amsterdam’s streets will bring into view both men and women of head-turningheight.This gain in height represents a recent trend, as the chart also shows. Therehave been steady gains in many countries since 1820, yet the Dutch stand outbecause they were the shortest Europeans back then. Examination of skeletons ingraves from 1850 indicate that Dutch men on average stood around 5 feet 5 inchesand women 5 feet 1 inch. (The second-tallest men in 2013, the Danes, were about6 centimeters [2.3 inches] taller than the Dutch in 1829 and now have fallenslightly behind.) What happened to cause such a dramatic growth spurt in such ashort period of time?Looking for an explanation, Olson consulted other statistics, which revealedthat as income went up and the Dutch became more prosperous, wealth was moreevenly spread out. Instead of the privileged few gaining all the money, almosteveryone did. This more equal distribution of wealth led to a better diet, whichis correlated with growing taller. But the same economic trend spread throughoutmost of Europe, so it doesn’t explain why the Dutch in particular grew so tall.To deepen the mystery, city dwellers in Holland actually decreased in statureduring parts of the nineteenth century as compared with the rural population.Living in a city, with its high infant mortality, communicable diseases, animpoverished underclass, and polluted air and water, led to a deficit in heightof one inch in men. At the same time, urban populations were steadily growingricher, so prosperity isn’t a perfect predictor of height.A clever possibility looks directly to genes. The sequence of the DNA in Dutchgenes is about the same as it was two hundred years ago. Until very recentlythere were no strong waves of immigration, and they wouldn’t alter Dutch genesunless there was intermarriage with the newcomers. But what if the reverse weretrue? It’s generally accepted, Olson points out, that our human ancestors weretall. Perhaps the Dutch used to be tall, hundreds of generations ago, but thenpoor diet caused them to shrink. In that case, a better diet might trigger theancestral genes, causing a growth spurt.That’s a tenuous possibility, yet any explanation must include genes, especiallythe epigenome. Since the epigenome is modified according to one’s pastexperiences, what could cause a sudden jump in height? As it happens, one of thebest proofs that epigenetics can in a sense record memories of past experiencesalso comes from Holland. The Dutch famine, also known as the Hongerwinter, or“hunger winter,” has probably taught us more about the effects of epigenetics inhumans than any other event. While the Germans were facing the beginnings ofdefeat in World War II in the extremely harsh winter of 1944, they enforced afood and supplies embargo on the Dutch and began systematically destroying thecountry’s transportation systems and farms. Drastic food shortages resulted, anda famine occurred over the winter of 1944–1945. Food stocks in the cities inwestern Holland quickly dwindled. The daily adult rations in Amsterdam droppedto below 1,000 calories by the end of November 1944 and to 580 calories by theend of February 1945—only one-quarter the calories needed for health andsurvival in an adult. The population subsisted mostly on hard bread, smallpotatoes, sugar, and very little, if any, protein.Millions of years of evolution have armed us with the ability to survive longperiods of malnutrition. The body slows down to conserve energy and resources.Blood pressure and heart rate are decreased, and we begin to live off our ownfat. Much of this ability is made possible by changes in the activities of ourgenes. In some cases, gene activities are turned up and down via epigenetics.The Dutch experience went even deeper, however, showing that DNA changes broughton in adult life can be inherited by the next generations. Studying the childrenborn to survivors of the Dutch famine revealed just this.Investigators from Harvard obtained the meticulously maintained health and birthrecords from that time, and as expected, babies born during the famine often hadsevere health issues. Infants in the womb in the third to ninth months ofpregnancy during the famine were born underweight. However, infants in the firsttrimester toward the end of the Hongerwinter—that is, on the cusp before foodsupplies returned—were actually born larger than average. The differing diets ofthe mothers created this effect.The bigger surprises, however, came in studying these offspring after theyreached adulthood. Compared with those born outside the famine, adults bornduring the famine were highly prone to obesity. In fact, there was a doubling ofobese individuals among those who were in the womb during the famine,particularly in the second and third trimesters. Some kind of epigenetic memoryseems to be at work. We will get to the exact mechanism in a moment.The Dutch famine studies are important because they opened everyone’s eyes tothe lifelong effects of prenatal experiences that cause changes in the genome.The beautiful and beloved actress Audrey Hepburn was a child in the Netherlandsduring the famine. As an adult she suffered from anemia and bouts of clinicaldepression. She was not alone. Babies who were in the womb during the faminewere also more prone to schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses. Althoughnot conclusive, some data indicate that when the famine babies had children oftheir own, the next generation was underweight. Like a conveyor belt, the genomekept passing along a severe food shortage from one generation to the next.THE CONVEYOR BELT OF EXPERIENCEThis new knowledge about inherited traits grew out of terrible suffering, but itsheds light on why better care of mothers during pregnancy is so critical. Butcontroversy surrounds the findings nevertheless. Can the conveyor belt reallycross the generation gap? In 2014, data coming from high-quality studies in miceprovided the first compelling evidence that transgenerational inheritance canoccur in mammals. A Cambridge University geneticist in England, AnneFerguson-Smith, published findings in the prestigious journal Science aftertesting the epigenetic implications of the Dutch famine in mice. “I decided itwas time I actually did some experiments on this myself,” she was quoted assaying, “rather than criticize people.”Heated criticism revolved around the key finding that a pregnant mother’s diethas a long-lasting impact on the health of her offspring late into their lives.To a strict Darwinian, at the moment the father’s sperm fertilizes the mother’segg, the fate of the genes is firmly established in the baby. Ferguson-Smith andher colleagues sought direct evidence by using a strain of mice that couldsurvive on an extremely low-calorie diet. As expected, the mice had extremelyunderweight offspring that were later prone to diabetes. The males in thislitter then fathered another generation, and the second generation of mice alsowent on to get diabetes even though they consumed a normal diet. These startlingfindings provided evidence that the genetic conveyor belt is real.The new paradigm opens enormous vistas. Pregnant mothers are already advised notto smoke or drink alcohol during pregnancy. Exposing the fetus to toxins raisesthe risk of birth defects. It’s good to heed the statistics about risks. Butwhat about enhancing a baby in the womb? You’ve probably read stories aboutpregnant mothers who play Mozart to their babies in the womb, and other reportsabout how a fetus in utero can be affected by stressful situations that themother-to-be undergoes. A major theme of this book is to give your genes thelifestyle with which they can optimally function. This would be doubly true ifyou are deciding the genetic inheritance of one, two, or more generations in thefuture. And what if the conveyor belt were loaded with such optimal experiencesthat children and grandchildren were given the best possible start in life by“soft” inheritance? To us, this is far more inspiring than schemes formanipulating the genome of embryos with the aim of a genetically “perfect” baby.The science of transformation doesn’t always have to mean implants and syringes.To bring about a generation of children with the best traits that can be passedon through soft inheritance, we must look deeper into the science behind whatthis means. To explain how an experience leads to genetic changes we need a newterm: epigenetic marks. Such marks are the fingerprints of change. They are keyfor solving the mystery of how any lifestyle change influences our genes, notjust a drastic change like the “hunger winter.” Epigenetic events can alsoprogram DNA by chemical modifications of the pillow-like proteins (calledhistones) that surround and cushion the DNA. These cushions also decide whatstretch of the DNA making up a gene is exposed to other proteins that turn thegene on and off, up and down in activity, and even what type of proteins or RNAthe gene will manufacture.[images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_006_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_006_r1.jpg]Imagine, then, that the body has begun to be food deprived and eventually beginsto starve. How does a pregnant mother’s body respond? We can observe it wastingaway, but invisibly her epigenome is creating genetic alterations. Thecushion-like proteins that surround the DNA start to interact differently withthe DNA, leaving epigenetic marks. The marks can be of various kinds, involvingspecific enzymes with names like methylase and histone deacetylases (HDACs).Even tiny bits of RNA (micro-RNAs) can do the job. You don’t need to rememberhow the chemistry of epigenetic programming works, but a growing body ofevidence indicates that diet, behavior, stress levels, and chemical pollutantscan all affect gene activity and thus one’s survival and well-being.*The epigenetic marks that are probably the most studied are those involving “DNAmethylation.” Wherever there are multiple C bases next to G bases in achromosome’s DNA sequence, there is an increased chance of methylation. If theseareas become overly tagged by methylation, gene activity can be turned off.Methyl marks offer a wide range of clues. For example, many allergies beginearly on in fetal development. If an expectant mother eats a diet rich in foodsthat tag DNA with methyl marks, it’s possible that allergies will more likelyarise in the child. This means that the same embryo gestating in two differentmothers can lead to two different babies despite having identical DNA. One studyshowed that simply by counting up the methylation marks on the genome of DNAfrom saliva, researchers can predict someone’s age to within five years. Themore marks, the older the person is, like reading tread wear on rubber tires.This implies that excessive methylation may be the cause of premature aging anddegenerative diseases among the elderly.Overfeeding mice just after birth has been shown to lead to an excess amount ofmethyl marks on specific genes that then predispose them to obesity. It isdifficult to extrapolate how these effects in mice play out in humans. But theDutch famine, and the experiments it led to, offers some stark testimony.A CLOUDY ANSWERBut what about the Dutch becoming the tallest men in the world? Sometimesanswering a question requires ruling out the false answers first. In this case,we know that no single gene for height is involved, because no such gene exists.If a pregnant woman wants a prediction about how tall her baby will grow up tobe, our current understanding of genetics can’t tell her. More than twenty geneshave been identified that contribute to the height of a child, and theirinteractions are too complex and slippery for making any accurate predictions.Even if this side of the story could be sorted out, there are environmentalfactors that by most estimates account for at least half of the final outcome.These factors include the mother’s diet as well as the baby’s, but alsointangibles like the behavior and lifestyle of the mother and the familyenvironment in which the child is raised. In North Korea and Guatemala, forexample, there is chronic malnutrition, and as a result, children grow upstunted. Poor medical care can have the same result, while better general healthmakes a population grow taller. But the Dutch aren’t markedly different in theseareas than the rest of Europe. As previously mentioned, over the last twohundred years, despite periods of declining diet, such as in Germany after WorldWar I, a better diet and greater prosperity have led to increased height in allEuropean countries.What other answers can be ruled out? No new genes entered the Dutch gene pool insufficient numbers to provide an answer. Even if new genes did mix with the old,there’s no evidence that the Dutch started marrying extremely tall newcomers.Nor will survival of the fittest tell the tale, because shorter Dutch men didn’tdie out after being defeated for food and water by taller men.However, mating habits could play a part. When the Chinese imperial court beganto favor lapdogs, the Pekingese breed emerged by design, beginning with theoriginal dogs from western China more than two thousand years ago. Ancient courtdocuments specify what the ideal Pekingese should look like, the model being aminiature lion. Breeders were instructed to develop a dog with a flat face,large glistening eyes, a mane, short legs, and very small size. In the mind’seye of a Chinese court lady, those qualities were lion-like. To arrive at theideal, dog breeders kept selecting the smallest pups in a litter and mating themto arrive at smaller dogs. In the same way, other aspects could be encouraged inthe breed.Human beings don’t mate by following a breeder’s chart, and historically almosteveryone got married, so specific traits weren’t weeded out, certainly notintentionally. But we do choose our mates consciously, following personalinclinations. If the Dutch came to admire height, and the tallest people wereattracted to other tall people, this sequence would produce taller offspringover time. Generally, genetic traits don’t favor extremes but return to themean. There have been humans as short as two feet and as tall as eight feet. Butthe overwhelming odds are that a baby will be born much closer to the average,growing up to be somewhere between five and six feet tall.Regression toward the mean, as statisticians call it, also explains why twoparents with high IQs can’t be guaranteed to produce a child with a high IQ. Thegenetic component of intelligence (which remains a controversial subject) favorsaverage intelligence, average height, average weight, and so on. Thus it wouldtake generations of Dutch people, a large majority marrying for height, toproduce a trend in the population. Once again, the story of inheritance is toocomplicated for one factor to suffice.So what now? Once you eliminate the false answers, a new kind of thinking startsto emerge. Dutch men grew taller, not by any simple cause and effect, butbecause of a cloud or fog of causes. Genes, epigenetics, behavior, diet, andvarious outside influences all played a part. This is true for all babies, so itmust be true for Dutch babies born over the span of two centuries. Out of thiscloud of causes, however, we can extract some positive conclusions:Many factors in the cloud of causes are under our control.Very few of the causes are deterministic. We are rarely puppets being controlledby our genes.The cloud of causes is highly adaptable to change.These are very important conclusions. A cloud changes shape when the windchanges, the temperature goes up and down, weather fronts move, and humidityrises and falls. At any given moment, the clouds you see floating overhead areresponding not simply to one of these influences, but to several or all of them.Trying to analyze one at a time isn’t valid and sometimes can’t be done. It’slike trying to predict what the temperature in your house will be if there werefive thermostats, each with its own setting for a single zone.Even under the worst conditions, like the terrible stresses of war, the humangenome can find an advantage. During the World War II food shortages in Holland,hospitals noticed an improvement in children hospitalized with the rareintestinal disorder celiac disease. The cause of the disorder was as yetunknown, although it had been hypothesized that diet, and specifically wheat,was involved. A Dutch pediatrician, Dr. Willem Dicke, investigated thisconnection. When the sick children had almost no bread, they recovered. When thefirst supplies of bread were allocated to sick children in hospitals, the celiacpatients relapsed. This occurrence proved the connection between celiac diseaseand wheat for the first time. It’s now known that celiac disease is anautoimmune disorder with a genetic predisposition that causes an allergicreaction to a gluten protein (gliadin) found in wheat. Similar gluten proteinsfound in other grains also create this reaction.Similarly, in countries like Holland and Belgium, where the diet was rich inbutter and cheese, the war caused a marked decrease in heart disease, which wasattributed to a sudden drop in daily calories and a drastic shortage of butter,milk, and cheese when these countries were occupied by the Nazis. Decades later,losing weight and drastically cutting back on daily fat intake became part ofheart-healthy programs for actually reversing heart disease.A cloud isn’t a very satisfying model for doing science, and it’s totallyinadequate for reaching results in medicine. Doctors are wedded to the linearmodel of cause and effect. Cause A leads to disorder B, for which the doctorprescribes drug C. But what if the cloud model is actually correct andinescapable? Nobody’s living room has five thermostats running independently,but we all have bodies with multiple clocks, biorhythms, and genetic schedules.For this reason, no two people are exactly matched for the day they lost theirfirst baby tooth, entered puberty, felt the first twinge of arthritis, or amyriad of other things that are timed individually. Everything about us moves ona sliding scale.The question arises, then: How does the human body manage to be so preciselyregulated that it synchronizes all its clocks down to the last molecules ofhormones, peptides, enzymes, proteins, and so forth? Like a cloud, we are pushedfrom all directions, but unlike a cloud, our bodies are miracles of complexitythat maintain an astonishing amount of control.Now that we have the complete DNA sequence of the human genome, it is mucheasier to find genes and mutations associated with the risk for disease.Thousands of disease-associated genes and mutations have been found fordisorders ranging from cancer to diabetes, from heart disease to thedegenerative brain diseases of old age. Rudy has found several genes andmutations that cause or affect one’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease (including thefirst such gene) as well as other insidious neurological disorders like Wilson’sdisease, a rare condition in which copper accumulates in the cells, leading toserious neurological, psychiatric, and other conditions. As increasing numbersof disease-causing genes have been elucidated, we have learned that roughly 5percent of disease mutations guarantee disease onset, while the vast majorityserve only to increase someone’s susceptibility, in concert with the environmentand aspects of the person’s lifestyle. The bottom line is that humans are abundle of complex traits for which direct genetic causes aren’t yet found andprobably won’t be found. A more realistic viewpoint of how common diseases areinherited would have DNA serving as the initial blueprint for a building thatwill be remodeled and repurposed over and over as needed.Some still believe that knowing what every gene does should be enough tounderstand all disease, and that when such links are validated, there’s thepromise that medical therapies to cure genetically linked diseases will follow.But there’s a reason why that step hasn’t occurred except for a tiny fraction ofdiseases. You can’t figure out what a gene is doing unless you know how it getsswitched on and off, up and down, and tweaked to make certain varieties ofproteins. No matter how perfect the circuitry for a computer is laid out, thecomputer is dead until it’s turned on. The same holds true for DNA. Thetriggering mechanism for genes was a mystery that opened the way for the presentgenetics revolution.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Note: To simplify the highly complex subject of genetic switches, we’vefocused on methyl marks, but switching also involves other chemical processes,such as acetylation, that we’re skipping over. The histone “pillows” are alsoinvolved in turning genes off and on or even changing how tightly the DNA helixis wound or folded. Both methylation and acetylation can modify histones and howthey bind to the DNA, thereby affecting the activities of genes in the region."},{"pageContent":"MAKING BETTER MEMORIESThe greatest achievement in Earth’s 2.8 billion years of evolution isn’t humanDNA or even the emergence of life from lifeless molecules swirling in steamingpools of chemical-rich water around the fissures of geysers. Evolution’sgreatest triumph is memory. Memory is what made life possible. This is clearenough. The antibodies in your immune system contain the memory of all thediseases confronted by the human race. A newborn baby fends off disease byrelying on the immune system of its mother, which it has borrowed. Soon thebaby’s own immunities will develop as the thymus gland, the repository of pastbattles against invading bacteria and viruses, starts to produce antibodies. Thethymus gland expands as it reaches full functioning during adolescence and thenshrinks as its task is completed around age twenty-one.If we focus just on this one process, the role of memory runs deep. The genes ofyour family line determine which antibodies will appear in you. That’s just atwig on the branch of human evolution; that branch leads back to the trunk ofthe tree, which contains the memory of how to make antibodies in the firstplace. The roots of the tree are DNA’s ability to remember experiences and toencode them for future generations. So the next time you don’t catch the coldthat is going around, you owe your immunity to the first molecule of DNA.Epigenetics suggests that our cells can in a sense “remember” everything we haveexperienced. But a suggestion isn’t proof. There’s a big difference betweenremembering your tenth birthday party and a geneticist examining the geneticmodifications that encode the memory. Imagine that you are a telegraph operatorfrom decades ago as streams of dots and dashes come across the wire. You canhold the code in your hands and count all the punches in the paper tape, but ifyou don’t know English, the messages are unreadable. In present-day genetics,the code is in our hands, but they’re in a language infinitely more difficultthan English, the very language of all human experiences.It’s a terrible fate to be at the mercy of your memories, but that’s thesituation almost everyone finds themselves in. Old fears, wounds, traumaticevents, and accidents litter the mind, roaming at will and distorting how weview the present. If you are an agoraphobic, with a fear of open or publicplaces, you can’t leave the house without suffering from anxiety. Your fear hasmade you a slave to memory. In small and large ways we are all enslaved byevents that are dead and gone. To be fully alive, you must learn to use yourmemories, not the other way around.FEAR AND THE ZAPPED COWSThis is a slightly uncomfortable exercise, but sit for a minute and let a badmemory return. It can be anything—the content doesn’t matter. Don’t reach for afreshly painful memory. Instead, go back to something that happened when youwere a small child. It could be falling off a swing or getting separated fromyour mother in the grocery store. What do you notice? First, that the memoryexists; second, that you can retrieve it. Depending on how deep the memory goes,you will also notice that it feels like real life repeating itself. The samepart of the visual cortex that sees a train wreck or a battle scene comes intoplay when a person visualizes the wreck or the battle by recalling it.Everything you are noticing is reflected in your epigenome. Let’s go a stepfurther. When the children of the Dutch famine became vulnerable to obesity,diabetes, and heart disease, those memories could be traced to their mothers’experience of near starvation. The children couldn’t see this experience intheir mind’s eye, and yet they inherited a molecular memory nonetheless. Astriking study published in the high-impact journal Nature Neuroscience in 2014added new evidence about memory’s effect on DNA, only in this case the driverwas not diet, but fear. In this study, scientists trained mice to fear the scentof the chemical acetophenone (which is pleasant, like orange blossoms andcherries) by giving them a mild electric shock whenever the smell wasintroduced.The shocks produced a stress reaction in the mice, which could be observed intheir nervous, shuddering behavior. After a while it wasn’t necessary to deliverthe shocks. Merely the smell of acetophenone was enough to produce the stressreaction. A maker of horror movies can do much the same thing by showing a darkroom with the sound of a creaking door. The heroine’s eyes dart in fear, andwhat’s happening in the audience? These harmless images and sounds produce theanticipation of something horrible about to happen. Evidence of the stressresponse will appear in most viewers.But the mouse study that associated a harmless odor with an electrical shockwent further. This acquired fear in adulthood was inherited by the mice’soffspring and even by the next generation. The children and grandchildren of thefear-conditioned mice had never experienced the fragrance of the acetophenonebefore, but they shuddered as soon as they smelled it, simply because theirparents were conditioned to associate the odor with pain. The researchers thenlooked at the gene that makes the protein receptor needed to smell the chemicaland found that it had been epigenetically modified by methylation.Folk wisdom has known about this phenomenon forever, as expressed in a piece ofcracker-barrel wisdom from Mark Twain: “If a cat sits on a hot stove, that catwon’t sit on a hot stove again. That cat won’t sit on a cold stove either.” Inthe same vein, the wisdom behind getting back on a horse after you fall off isbased on the instinctive knowledge that fear can make a lasting impressionunless you counter it as soon as possible. Of course, this type of conditioningis mediated by memories maintained by the neural networks in your brain. Thesame experiences can chemically modify your genome to create a parallel“molecular memory.”We’ve repeated several times that DNA is responsible for both stability andchange. Now we’ve arrived at a new wrinkle. How do our brain and genes determinethe difference between real danger (a hot stove) and imagined danger (a coldstove)? Animals apparently don’t, as proved by studies of cattle trained byelectric fences. The first step is to enclose cattle in a tight corral boundedby an electric fence that delivers a harmless shock if touched. The electricalcurrent runs through one thin wire.After only a day, and sometimes just an hour, the zapped cows have learned toavoid the fence. They can then be released into a grazing area that is fenced inby a single wire. Even though the cattle could easily break through thisbarrier, training them with an electrified wire keeps then inside. Thus the oldprinciple of physically hemming the cows in with barriers like rail fences isexchanged for a psychological barrier. It’s difficult for old ranchers to acceptthat a psychological fence can be more powerful than a physical one, but inexperiments in which hungry cows were separated from a bale of hay by a singlestrand of electric wire, they would not break through it to get at the food.Is this form of psychological training inheritable? So it appears, as evidencedonce again by cattle. To keep cattle from wandering down a road, ranchersinstall grids, usually steel railing, with gaps between the rails. Yet itappears that actual cattle grids aren’t necessary. They can be fooled by phonygrids, as described by Rupert Sheldrake, a British biologist famed foradventurous thought and investigation. (This trait has made him a groundbreakingthinker, an audacious rebel, an outlier from mainstream biology, or someone fartoo credulous about mysterious phenomena, depending on the view of him you take.We greatly appreciate his daring.) In a New Scientist article from 1988,Sheldrake writes:> Ranchers throughout the American West have found that they can save money on> cattle grids by using fake grids instead, consisting of stripes painted across> the road….Real cattle grids make it physically impossible for cattle to walk> across them. However, cattle do not usually try to cross them; they avoid> them. The illusory grids work just like real ones. When cattle approach them,> they “put on brakes with all four feet,” as one rancher expressed it to me.Although Sheldrake picked up on this phenomenon from American friends he wasvisiting in Nevada, the implications resonated with him. For decades Sheldrakehad been almost a lone voice proposing that memories can be passed down from onegeneration to the next. Undaunted by ridicule from orthodox geneticists—this waslong before the advent of epigenetics—he wrote farseeing books like A NewScience of Life (1981) and The Presence of the Past (1988) to amass the mountingevidence that inheritance across the generations was real. These are still amongthe most fascinating and eye-opening books on the subject of memory as the majorforce in evolution. As Sheldrake explains:> According to my hypothesis…organisms inherit habits from previous members of> their species. This collective memory, I suggest, is inherent in fields,> called morphic fields, and is transmitted through both time and space….From> this point of view, cattle confronted for the first time by grids, or by> things that look like grids, would tend to avoid them because of [inheritance]> from other cattle that had learnt by experience not to try to cross them.A skeptic would protest that other, more conventional explanations must be atwork. It could be that cows don’t inherit an avoidance of cattle grids butacquire it individually through painful exposure to real grids, or else theysomehow pick it up from more experienced members of the herd.Sheldrake responds:> This does not seem to be the case. Ranchers have told me that herds not> previously exposed to real cattle grids will avoid the fake ones. This has> also been found by researchers in the departments of animal science at> Colorado State University and Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University,> with whom I have been in correspondence. Ted Friend, of Texas A&M, has tested> the response of several hundred head of cattle to painted grids, and has found> that naïve animals avoid them just as much as those previously exposed to real> grids.Is this also a possibility among humans? Inheriting a behavioral trait mightexplain why Mohawk Indians have worked for generations on the construction ofNew York skyscrapers—they walk on the beams hundreds of feet in the air,apparently with no fear of falling. Did they inherit this trait? Does the samekind of inheritance account for why Russian chess players have won the worldchampionship many times over?Yet the effect of memory inherited across generations is soft enough that it canbe reversed, at least in animals. Writing about the cattle who shy away fromphony grids, Sheldrake says:> Nevertheless, the spell of a fake grid can be broken. If cows are driven> towards one under pressure, or if food is placed on the other side, a few will> jump it; but sometimes one will examine it closely and then simply walk> across. If one member of a herd does this, then the others soon follow.> Thereafter, the phony grid ceases to act as a barrier.At least some sheep and horses also show an innate aversion to crossing paintedgrids. By contrast, in perhaps the only experiment of this kind ever carried outwith pigs, the animals ran up to the painted grid, sniffed it, and started tolick it up. The Texas researchers had used a washable water-based paint with aflour-and-egg base.Noticing these aspects of memory comes easily. We are all expert time travelersin our minds. But as skillful as we are at storing a memory and recalling it, weare much worse at erasing bad memories. Memories are sticky. Years of therapycan fail to undo the power of old traumas. Drugs and alcohol only mask themtemporarily. Denial pushes a bad memory under the carpet, but there’s noguarantee that it will stay there.Genetics tells us that any past experience, good or bad, is sticky because ithas taken its place, using chemical bonds, deep inside the cell, in the nucleuswhere DNA resides. In a molecule of salt, atoms of sodium and chlorine aretightly bound together. A lot depends on their remaining stuck, because if youpoured out some salt and it separated into its components, the release ofchlorine gas would be poisonous. Likewise, it’s necessary for DNA’s bonds toremain secure or life would vanish into a cloud of atoms.Life is about the persistence of memory. Until recently, the only memoriesavailable to geneticists were the rungs that connect the double helix of DNA,and these were fixed in place long, long ago in evolutionary time. However,epigenetics now uses chemistry to create genetic memories of past experiences,which are much more recent and intimate than the 2.8-billion-year-old memoriesthat originally built the DNA molecule."},{"pageContent":"FROM ADAPTATION TO TRANSFORMATIONGenetics is well under way with its present revolution, but how does it impactyou in your daily life? Simply, through adaptation. Dinosaurs adjusted so wellto their environment that they dominated life on Earth as the major predator.They pushed the climate barrier, moving into colder zones that are now in theArctic (because of the shift of tectonic plates). In their diets, some dinosaurswere vegetarians and some carnivores. But superb as this adaptability was, acataclysmic event destroyed the dinosaurs. A giant meteor collision with Earth,thought to be in the region of present-day Yucatán in Mexico, created anovernight change in climate. Dust from the impact clouded the sun all over theglobe, the temperature dropped precipitously, and dinosaur DNA didn’t have timeto change.Or did it? Some present-day reptiles survive freezing climates by hibernatingthrough the winter, which allows snakes to live in New England, for example. Butadaptation takes a long time, eons even, only if a species has to wait forrandom mutations. Adaptation can occur much more quickly in an individualthrough gene expression.THE GOAT WHO WOULD BE HUMANIn 1942 a Dutch veterinarian and anatomist named E. J. Slijper reported on agoat born in the 1920s with no functional forelegs. The baby goat adapted to itsunfortunate condition by learning how to hop, kangaroo-like, on its hind legs.The goat survived a year before dying accidentally. When Slijper performed anautopsy, he found several surprises. The goat’s hind leg bones had elongated.Its spine was S shaped, like our human spine, and the bones were attached to themuscles in a way that looked more like those of a human than those of a goat.Two other human characteristics had started to form—a broader, thicker plate ofbone protecting the knee and a rounded inner cavity in the abdomen.It’s startling to think that in one year a new behavior, walking upright, couldmake it appear as if a goat were becoming human, or at least like an animal thatwalks on two legs, because all of these changes are associated with theevolution of bipedal motion. Gene activities had changed to remodel the goat’sanatomy. For a long time Slijper’s goat attracted no serious attention. In thestandard Darwinian view, how humans learned to walk on two legs was by randommutations that changed our carriage from the stooped posture of other primates,and that such mutations almost always occur one at a time. Even withoutSlijper’s observations, it’s quite challenging for evolutionists to explain howall the anatomical adjustments needed for human beings to walk upright couldcredibly occur one at a time. However, they all work together, and the goatproved that they could arise together, not as mutations but as adaptations. Canthe epigenome actually pass along a complete and interconnected set of changes?While the argument rages back and forth, there is no backing down from the speedof adaptations in human beings. The question of how much your lifestyle willaffect your children and grandchildren hasn’t been settled. But the changesoccurring in you are indisputable.This is why identical twins are not actually identical. Beginning at birth, theystart to live different lives and thus become different people, despite carryingvirtually duplicate genomes. Identical twins can be quite variable in theirsusceptibility to disease and in their behavior. Genetic studies of identicaltwins have traditionally been used to determine what is referred to as theheritability of disease. If one twin gets a certain disease, what are the oddsthat the other will get that disease within fifteen years or so? It’s a simplecalculation, actually. After studying hundreds of pairs of identical twins,researchers determined that the probability for Alzheimer’s disease occurring inboth twins is 79 percent if one of them is afflicted. This means that lifestyleaccounts for 21 percent of the probability of developing Alzheimer’s, even withidentical genomes.In contrast, for Parkinson’s disease, the heritability is only about 5 percent;therefore lifestyle would appear to play a hugely greater role. For hipfractures under the age of seventy, the heritability is 68 percent, but afterage seventy it goes down to 47 percent. For coronary artery disease, theinheritability is about 50 percent, no more than random chance. For variouscancers—colon, prostate, breast, and lung—the heritability in identical twinsranges from 25 percent to 40 percent, which is why the current view holds thatthe majority of cancers, perhaps a large majority, are preventable. Epigeneticchanges associated with cancer can be induced by factors like chronic exposureto asbestos, solvents, and cigarette smoke. Yet these cancer-causing epigeneticchanges could be offset with a healthy diet and exercise—it’s a highly promisingpossibility.CHANGE IS IN THE AIRPhysical changes don’t always need physical causes. Sometimes the stimulus cansimply be a word. If you meet someone new and fall in love, there’s a dramaticshift in brain activity—this has been thoroughly documented—and if the personyou’re smitten with says “I love you,” as opposed to “I’m seeing someone else,”the gene expression in the emotional center of your brain will be dramaticallyaltered. At the same time, chemical messages sent via the endocrine system willcreate an adaptation in your heart and other organs. To be accepted by a belovedcan make you lovesick; to be rejected makes you heartsick. There’s a unique geneexpression for both.There’s solid science behind these age-old experiences. In a 1991 study bymicrobiologists at the University of Alabama, mice were injected with a chemicalthat boosted their immune system. This chemical, known as poly I:C(polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid), causes greater activity in part of the immunesystem called natural killer cells. At the same time as the mice received thepoly I:C injection, the odor of camphor was released in the air. The mice werequickly trained to associate the two, and thereafter a tiny amount of poly I:Cwould be enough to stimulate the mice’s natural killer cells as long as thesmell of camphor was in the air.The mice’s bodies on their own manufactured the chemicals needed to stimulatetheir immune system. All they needed was a small trigger. This is an impressivefinding, because it shows that genes can adapt in a specific direction with verylittle motivation. The actual molecules of camphor passing from the nose to thebrain of a mouse have no effect on the immune system. It was the association ofthe camphor that created the effect. We’ve gone one step further than the zappedcattle, whose behavior was changed by remembering the pain of being shocked. Themice did no conscious learning. Their bodies adapted without the mind (such asit is) having to learn or even think.Human beings can think, of course, but our body is constantly being affectedwhen we aren’t aware of it. As far as smell is concerned, pheromones given offby the skin are connected to sexual attraction in mammals and seem to play apart in human attraction. In an experiment to test aromatherapy, researchersfound that people reliably report a positive mood change after smelling lemonoil as compared with no change after smelling lavender or odorless water. Thismood elevation happened whether the subjects had ever experienced aromatherapybefore. In fact, one group wasn’t told anything about the aromas or what toexpect, and their mood also improved upon smelling the lemon oil.Yet the power of expectation is undeniably strong. In the placebo effect, asubject is given an inert sugar pill and told that it’s a drug for relievingsymptoms like pain or nausea, and in 30 to 50 percent of people, the body stepsin and produces the chemicals needed to bring about the expected result. Asfamiliar as the placebo effect has become, it’s still remarkable that mere words(“This will help your nausea”) can trigger such a specific response in theconnection between brain and stomach. You can even give the subject a drug thatcauses nausea, and just by being told that it’s an anti-nausea pill, some peoplewill experience that their nausea goes away. To complete the picture, there’sthe nocebo effect, in which giving someone a harmless sugar pill and tellingthem that they won’t feel any benefit from it can even create negative effects.We seem to have wandered rather far from how adaptation failed the dinosaurs,but all of these findings are highly relevant. If a mere odor or the words “Thiswill make you feel better” can alter gene expression, and if a totally inertsubstance can create nausea or make it go away, the whole world of adaptation iswide open. Instead of being like Pavlov’s dogs, which salivated every time theyheard a bell associated with mealtime, humans insert anotherstep—interpretation.In a mouse trained to associate camphor with a stronger immune response, thereisn’t any interpretation. Stimulus leads to response. But all attempts to trainhuman behavior run at least a fifty-fifty chance of failing. Positive incentiveslike money, power, and pleasure affect everyone, but there’s always the personwho says no and walks away. Negative incentives like physical punishment,bullying, and extortion are very likely to make people do what their tormentorswant them to do, but there are always some who resist and don’t comply. Betweenthe stimulus and the response comes the conscious mind and its ability tointerpret the situation and respond accordingly.So what we have is a feedback loop that is at work in every experience. There’sa triggering event A, leading to mental interpretation B, resulting in responseC. This response is remembered by the mind, and the next time the same event Aarises, the response won’t be exactly the same. This feedback loop is like anever-ending conversation between mind, body, and the outside world. We adaptquickly and constantly.This result became even more fascinating when the experiments took the same odorof camphor and introduced it while the mice were injected with a drug thatlowered immune response. Once more, after a period of time it took only thecamphor smell to impair the mice’s immune response. In other words, the samestimulus (camphor) could induce a specific response and its exact opposite.ADAPT FIRST, MUTATE LATERIn spite of the growing base of evidence supporting epigenetics, someevolutionary biologists are certain to insist that the evolution of our speciesis entirely random and based solely on natural selection. To even imply thatthere may be some highly interactive epigenetic program driving the evolution ofour species will prompt many a staunch, card-carrying evolutionary biologist tofroth at the mouth and label you a “creationist” touting notions of “intelligentdesign.” We are certainly not suggesting “intelligent design.” However,considering the mounting evidence for the effects of epigenetics on overallhealth, it’s time to seriously consider what the new genetics is teaching usabout our own evolution.Current findings could make a life-or-death difference. For nearly three decadesat Ohio State University, Professor Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and her colleagueshave been examining the effects of chronic stress on the immune system. Thegeneral picture was already well known. If you are subjected to repeated stress,resistance to disease goes down. In addition, you run the risk of developingdisorders like heart disease and hypertension. But people are much less familiarwith the dangers of everyday stress, the kind we don’t like but feel we shouldput up with.Kiecolt-Glaser’s group looked at a stress that has become far more commonrecently, taking care of someone with Alzheimer’s disease. The baby boomgeneration is being sidelined more and more by taking on the responsibility foraging parents with Alzheimer’s, and because professional care is limited and tooexpensive, millions of grown children find themselves being the last resort forcaregiving. As much as we love our parents, round-the-clock caregiving imposesserious chronic stress, day in and day out.A genetic price is being paid. As a research website from Ohio State reported:“Earlier work by other researchers has shown that mothers caring for chronicallyill children developed changes in their chromosomes that effectively amounted toseveral years of additional aging among those caregivers.” When their attentionturned specifically to Alzheimer’s caregivers, it wasn’t surprising thatKiecolt-Glaser’s team found higher indications of depression and otherpsychological effects. But they also wanted to target the specific cells thatshowed evidence of genetic changes.They found them in the telomeres of immune cells. Telomeres, you recall, are thecaps that end a DNA sequence like the period at the end of a sentence. Telomeresfray as cells divide over and over, which gives a marker for aging. “We believethat the changes in these immune cells represent the whole cell population inthe body, suggesting that all the body’s cells have aged that same amount,” saysKiecolt-Glaser. She estimates that this accelerated aging deprives Alzheimer’scaregivers of four to eight years of life. In other words, the adaptability ofour bodies has serious limitations.Kiecolt-Glaser pointed out that there are ample existing data showing thatstressed caregivers die sooner than people not in that role. “Now we have a goodbiological reason for why this is the case,” she said. As Rudy was quick toappreciate while sequencing through entire genomes of over fifteen hundredAlzheimer’s patients and their healthy siblings, the genome is chock-full ofrepetitive sequences of A’s, C’s, T’s, and G’s. Some of these repeat sequencesin the DNA can bind certain proteins residing deeply inside the nucleus of thecell in order to control the activities of genes in their vicinity. Otherrepeats lie at the tips of chromosomes, and their length is controlled byproteins such as telomerase. The longer the chromosome tips stay stable (rebuiltby telomerase), the longer the cell survives.The fact is, over our lifetime we are adapting to our environment every day bymodifying our bodies, including at the level of our gene activities. Your nextmeal, your next mood, your next hour of exercise is modifying your body in anendless flow of change. Darwin explained how a species adapts to the environmentover eons of time, allowing for tens of millions of years during which dinosaursarose and then changed into birds. Flight feathers are a physical adaptation toenvironmental pressure and nothing more to a strict Darwinist. But in fact ourgenomes are adapting in real time at every moment of our lives in the form ofgene activity. Is it possible that these adaptations are a driving force all ontheir own?This is a hot-button issue right now. For the vast majority of evolutionarybiologists, putting adaptation before mutation is unacceptable. But there areexceptions. In a New Scientist article from January 2015 titled “Adapt First,Mutate Later,” reporter Colin Barras brings up Slijper’s goat in a new context.A primitive fish from Africa called the bichir has the ability to survive onland. As an adaptation, walking on land aids survival in the drought season byallowing the bichir to leave a dried-up pool to find fresh water as well as newsources of food and a wider territory to colonize. Other species have the sameadaptation. When a walking catfish from Southeast Asia (Clarias batrachus)escaped into the wild in Florida, it became highly invasive by traveling overland. The walking catfish doesn’t use two legs but wriggles along, propped up onits front or pectoral fins, which keep its head up. As long as they stay moist,these catfish can remain out of the water almost indefinitely.This adaptation to land travel reminded Emily Standen, an evolutionist at theUniversity of Ottawa, of how ancestral fish emerged from the oceans hundreds ofmillions of years ago. Recently a 360-million-year-old fossil has caused asensation by providing physical evidence of this epochal change in life onEarth. A newly discovered fossil fish named Tiktaalik roseae had a skeleton thatwas fishlike but with new features that were like tetrapods, or four-legged landdwellers. Standen specializes in the mechanics of evolving species, and shewondered whether these same adaptations could be sped up—and they could, quitedramatically.Standen and her team raised bichir fish on land, and being forced to wriggle ontheir fins more than they normally would in the wild, the fish changed theirbehavior, becoming more efficient walkers. They placed their fins closer totheir bodies and raised their heads up higher. Their skeletons also showeddevelopmental changes—the bones supporting the fins had changed shape inresponse to higher gravity (fish in water weigh less). Like Slijper’s goat, awhole group of necessary adaptations had formed. It will take time to see howfar this line of research will take us, but it already suggests exactly what thetitle of the New Scientist article says: “Adapt first, mutate later.”THE RUSSIAN DOLL PROBLEMThis revisionist thinking is a lot to take in, but we assure you that it is allleading to something great. Replacing the simple cause-and-effect model ofevolution for a cloud of vague influences is unsettling. The same holds true foryour body right this minute. On any given day it is bombarded withinfluences—through food, behavior, mental activity, the five senses, andeverything happening in the environment. Which one will be decisive? Genes canpredispose you to depression or type 2 diabetes or certain kinds of cancer, yetonly a percentage of people with such a predisposition are going to have thegene activated. Locating the specific factor, or factors, that will activate aspecific gene is like throwing a deck of cards in the air and plucking out theace of spades as they scatter.Scientists don’t like giving up straight-line cause and effect. Many hate thevery idea. So we are left with a model that looks like a traditional matryoshka,or Russian nesting doll, in which inside the biggest doll is a smaller one, theninside it a still smaller one, and so on, until an extremely tiny last doll.Nesting dolls are delightful, but what if you claimed that the biggest doll wasactually built by the one inside it, and that one by the next smallest, and soon?That’s essentially where genetics has led us. Sometimes the genetic picture isuncomplicated enough that no ambiguity arises. Imagine you see one whiteflamingo standing out among thousands of pink ones. What caused it to be white?A linear sequence of reasoning gives the answer. First comes a species, thegenus Phoenicopterus, which contains six species of flamingos divided betweenthe Americas and Africa. Each has a dominant gene that produces pink feathersgeneration after generation. But all genes can mutate or fail to appear, leadingat random to albinism in a single chick. The number of chicks born with whitefeathers can be statistically predicted, and there the story ends.We’re using Russian-doll reasoning here, going to smaller and smaller levels ofNature in search of causes. This is the reductionist method, which hastime-honored value in science. Chasing nature down to its smallest component isthe very business of science, whether it’s a physicist chasing down subatomicparticles or a geneticist chasing down methyl marks on a gene. But there’s aproblem here, and it’s quite crucial.Consider someone who has become obese, joining the current epidemic of obesitythat has swept through developed countries. There are many theories about why anindividual becomes obese. Stress, hormonal imbalance, bad eating habits fromchildhood, and the excess of refined sugar and starches in the modern diet haveall been suggested. Using Russian-doll reasoning, the eventual explanation wouldbe traced to the genetic level. Although there was once a committed search for“the obesity gene,” bolstered by statistical evidence showing that overweightruns in families, that project met with only limited success, identifying somegenes (e.g., the FTO gene) that carry DNA variants mildly predisposed toobesity. As with disorders like schizophrenia that have a genetic component, thegenetic influence at best provides a predisposition.Today, a smaller doll has been found in the form of epigenetics and the switchesit controls. Almost every factor that might contribute to obesity, whether it’stoo much stress, excess sugar, bad eating habits, or hormonal imbalance, wouldtheoretically be regulated by the epigenome, the switching station that turnsexperience into genetic alterations. But here the reductionist line of reasoninghits a wall. It is extremely difficult to tell which particular experiencecreates which mark on which gene, thereby shifting gene activity. Some peoplegrow obese with or without stress, with or without sugar, and so on. As aresult, it is impossible to predict with any accuracy how past or futureexperiences reliably alter your gene activity. The cloud of causes thatsurrounds why Dutch men suddenly grew so tall surrounds a great deal ofepigenetics. Something is creating methyl marks, but the mark is material innature while the something that caused it often is not. An environmental toxincan cause epigenetic changes, but so can a strong emotion, like fear, at leastin mice so far.If you look deeper, the basic assumption that a material cause of epigeneticmarks must be at work turns out to be wobbly. It is the entire range of lifeexperience, from physical interactions to emotional reactions, that govern thechemical modification of certain genes with methyl marks. A methyl mark, whichyou recall is the most studied method for the epigenome to modify a gene, isextremely small. Chemically, a methyl group is tiny, no more than a carbon atomlinked to three hydrogen atoms. Methylation marks only the C (cytosine) basepair, sticking to it like a remora, or sucker fish, to the belly of a shark—thecytosine molecule is forty times bigger. It’s been shown that when DNA ismodified with more methyl marks, some portion of it is switched off. So we seemto be at the smallest doll, the one that switches all the bigger ones. Ninetypercent of the modifications in DNA associated with disease are located inswitching areas of the gene. Moreover, epigenetics has a remarkable effect onprenatal development, personality and behavioral tics, and susceptibility todisease above and beyond the genes and mutations inherited from our parents.How your mother lived her life while carrying you in the womb may potentiallyaffect your own gene activities and your risk for disease decades later.Canadian researchers at the University of Lethbridge subjected adult rats tostressful conditions and then studied their offspring. The daughter rats ofstressed mothers had shorter pregnancies. Even the granddaughter rats, themothers of which were not stressed, had shorter pregnancies. The researchersproposed that this occurrence was due to epigenetics. More specifically, theystated that the epigenetic changes brought on by stress involve what are calledmicro-RNAs,* tiny segments of RNA made from the genome that then regulate geneactivity.Leaving aside potential abnormalities that medical research can focus on,switching is how all of us got here. It’s basic to the journey by which a singlefertilized cell in a mother’s womb grows into a fully formed healthy baby. Asthis first cell divides, every future cell contains the same DNA. But to developa baby, there have to be liver cells, heart cells, brain cells, and so on, alldifferent from one another. The epigenome and its marks regulate the difference.It was realized that a map of the epigenome was urgently needed in order tolocate how each type of cell is determined in the development of an embryo inthe womb. Four countries—the United States, France, Germany, and the UnitedKingdom—have funded the Human Epigenome Project, whose mission is to show whereall the relevant marks are, or in official language, to “identify, catalog, andinterpret genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of all human genes in all majortissues.”With the participation of over two hundred scientists, a milestone was marked inFebruary 2015 by the publication of twenty-four papers describing, out of themillions of switches involved, those that determine the development of over onehundred types of cells in our bodies. This effort involved thousands ofexperiments with adult tissue as well as fetal and stem cells. (In theory,counting all the spots on all the leopards in the world would be easier.) Thechemicals that regulate different kinds of cells were already known, andsometimes the switches for them aren’t close to the affected gene. In fact,switch A can be located at a considerable distance from gene B. In such casesthe researchers sometimes had to infer the switch’s role by looking at thechemical regulator. If it was present in a cell, they inferred that the switchwas turned on.PARENTS, BABIES, AND GENESArriving at this portion of the epigenome map was an exciting development.Switching key genes on and off potentially might be the best route to preventingand curing a host of diseases. As the researchers acknowledge, locating allthese switches gives them mountains of new data, but that’s only a beginning. Inthe activity of DNA, switches interact; they form circuits called networks; theycan even act on the genes from a distance. Unraveling all the circuitry doesn’tindicate why the activity arises, any more than mapping the location of everytelephone in a city tells you what people are saying to each other when theycall. Different regions of the genome can be turned on in parallel viaepigenetics owing to a three-dimensional reorganization of the genome (such asfolding the DNA strand into a loop) that brings those regions into closeproximity.There is also the effect that epigenetics has on a child’s early life afterleaving the womb. This period is like a pivot between the mother’s epigeneticinfluence and the experiences that belong to the infant. How important is theoverlap between the two? This question is central to medical issues surroundinginfants, and one of these is peanut allergies. As reported in the New York Timesin February 2015, about 2 percent of children in the United States are allergicto peanuts, a number that has quadrupled since 1997. No one can explain why, butthere’s been a sharp rise in all allergies in the past few decades, which alsoremains a mystery. This rise holds true across all Western countries.A child with a strong peanut allergy can potentially die from exposure to even asmall trace of peanuts in food. The standard recommendation has been that givingpeanut butter and other peanut-related foods to infants increases their risk fordeveloping the allergy. But a compelling 2014 study published in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine has turned conventional wisdom on its head. Feeding infantsfoods like peanut butter early in life “dramatically decreases the risk ofdevelopment of peanut allergy,” the study’s authors concluded. This washeartening news, since it indicated that a step in infant care could reduce oreven reverse a rising trend.The new study was based in London, where 530 infants considered at risk fordeveloping peanut allergy (for example, they might already be allergic to eggsor milk) were divided into two groups. Starting when the infants were betweenfour and eleven months old, one group was fed food containing peanuts, while theother had such foods withheld. By age five, the group exposed to peanuts had farless incidence of allergy, 1.9 percent as compared with 13.7 percent for thosewhose parents avoided feeding them peanut foods. In fact, it was speculated thathaving concerned parents keep peanuts away from their infant children might haveactually caused the dramatic rise in peanut allergies.For quite a while parents have been confused over the issue of allergies andnewborns, not just relating to peanuts. Before this new finding, the dataweren’t clear. As we’ve discussed, a newborn baby inherits its mother’s immunesystem, which serves as a bridge while the baby begins to develop its ownantibodies. The thymus gland, located in the chest roughly between the lungs andin front of the heart, is where the immune system’s T cells mature. When thebody is invaded by outside viruses, bacteria, or everyday substances likepollen, T cells are responsible for recognizing which invaders to repel. Anallergy is like a case of mistaken identity, in which an innocent substance isidentified as a foe, leading to an allergic reaction created by the body itself,not by the invader.The thymus is at its most active right after birth up through childhood; oncesomeone has developed a full complement of T cells, the organ atrophies afterpuberty. The issue with allergies centers on how much of our immunity isinherited genetically and how much is influenced by the environment after we’reborn. To explain the alarming rise in allergies in developed countries, it wouldseem that the more polluted the environment, the worse the problem should be.But after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the opening up of itssatellite countries, which generally have much higher pollution rates than theUnited States or Western Europe, investigators were stymied to find that highlypolluted areas in Eastern Europe showed lower allergy rates than in the West.Then it was thought that the reverse is true: Western countries are overly cleanand sanitized, depriving the immune system of exposure to substances that itneeds to adapt to. Therefore the peanut-allergy finding could be verysignificant. American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines issued in 2000recommended that infants up to age three shouldn’t eat foods with peanuts inthem if they were at risk for developing the allergy. By 2008 the academyacknowledged that there was no conclusive evidence that avoiding peanuts waseffective beyond the age of four to six months. But there was as yet no studyshowing that it was correct to stop avoiding peanuts at all. The first real cluecame in a 2008 survey published in the Journal of Allergy and ClinicalImmunology, which found that the number of children with peanut allergy inIsrael was one-tenth that of Jewish children in the United Kingdom. Thesignificant difference seemed to be that Israeli children consume peanut foodsin their first year, especially Bamba, a popular snack that combines puffed cornand peanut butter, while British children don’t if their parents are allergyconscious.The new study, however, doesn’t apply to other foods that children developallergies to. And two major questions remain to be answered: First, if thechildren who were fed peanut foods stop eating them, are they liable to developthe allergy? This question is being studied in a follow-up with the originalsubjects. Second, are the results applicable to kids at low risk for foodallergies? That’s unknown, but researchers tend to feel that eating peanut foodwill do them no harm. Asking anxious parents to change their habits, however,may be difficult, since standard care has made such an issue of avoiding the“wrong” foods.We’ve gone into some detail, not because we have the answer to allergies, but tomake it clear how uncertain environmental influences can be, even though it’sknown in a general way that epigenetic marks are sensitive to them. Themiraculous development of a human from embryo to infant, toddler, adolescent,and adult involves an intricate dance between genes and the environment. Inmammals, interactions between the newborn child and its parents can haveprofound effects on the child’s health decades later. Although many findings inthis area have emerged only from mouse and rat studies, there is increasingevidence that they may pertain to humans as well. For example, mounting evidenceshows that early-life abuse, neglect, and mistreatment lead to epigeneticeffects on gene activity that adversely affect physical and mental health laterin life.For good or ill, early events shaping the bonds between parent and child haveprofound effects on the child’s brain development and personality. But how dothese bonds get established? Increasingly, studies show that epigeneticmodifications of the child’s genes are largely responsible, guided by childhoodexperiences that begin with the earliest days of life. When a mother actsdetached from her child, there can be a dysfunctionalhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response associated with stress, impairedcognitive development, and the elevation of toxic cortisol, as measured in thechild’s saliva.Some abused children die young, and in these tragic cases their brains can bestudied at autopsy. Research of this type has shown clear evidence of epigeneticmodification (increased methylation) of the gene NR3C1, which results in nervecell death in the brain region known as the hippocampus, used for short-termmemory. In living children, the same gene modification can be found in thesaliva of emotionally, physically, and sexually abused kids. Such damage canlead to subsequent psychopathic behavior.These findings extend the long-held understanding that early abuse and neglecthave profound psychological effects. Now we can trace the damage to the cellularlevel. In the search for the biological changes that underlie these events,epigenetic pathways controlling gene expression in the brain are increasinglybeing implicated. By the same token, it may be possible in the future to testthe effectiveness of psychological or drug therapies by looking to see if theill effects in the epigenome have been reversed.Progress has already been made in animal trials. In 2004 a study at McGillUniversity conducted by neuroscientist Dr. Michael Meaney showed that baby ratswho were groomed (licked) often by their mothers had increased levels ofglucocorticoid receptors in the brain, resulting in a reduction in anxiety andaggressive behavior. How were these behavioral changes achieved? Again, byepigenetics. Mice who received affectionate nurturing and grooming by theirmothers underwent less modification of their glucocorticoid receptor genes bymethylation, resulting in decreased amounts of cortisol, thereby lowering theanxiety, aggression, and stress response.The most controversial area in epigenetics has to do with later generationsbeing affected by stress and abuse today. When male mice are separated fromtheir mothers after birth, they can suffer from anxiety and features ofdepression, like listlessness, that are then passed on to subsequentgenerations. The negative epigenetic changes are actually found in the mice’ssperm following the mice’s separation from their mothers—the sperm then servingas the vehicle for transmission to the offspring. Related studies have shownthat a whole host of effects, from poor diet and stress to exposure to toxins(for example, pesticides that lead to epigenetic modifications in the brains andsperm of mice), can then be transmitted to the next generation.A profound example of how we may be able to affect our own gene activity comesfrom a study straight out of science fiction. A Swiss-French team in Zurich wasinspired by an innovative game called Mindflex, which comes with a headset thatpicks up brain waves from the player’s forehead and earlobes. By focusing on alight foam ball, the player can lift it up or down on a column of air. The gameconsists of being able to move the ball through an obstacle course, usingthought alone.The researchers wondered if the same approach could alter gene activity. Theydevised an electroencephalograph (EEG) helmet that analyzed brain waves andcould then transmit them wirelessly via Bluetooth. As reported by Engineering &Technology (E&T) magazine in November 2014, the brain waves were turned into anelectromagnetic field inside a unit that powered an implant inside a cellculture. The implant was fitted with a light-emitting-diode (LED) lamp thatemitted infrared light. The light then triggered the production of a specificdesired protein in the cells. One of the lead researchers commented,“Controlling genes in this way is completely new and is unique in itssimplicity.”The researchers used infrared light because it doesn’t harm cells while yetpenetrating deep into the tissue. After remote brain transmissions worked ontissue samples, the team progressed to mice, where it was also successful.Various human test subjects were asked to wear the EEG helmet and to control theproduction of proteins in mice simply by using their thoughts. Out of threegroups, the first were made to concentrate their mind by playing Minecraft on acomputer. As reported in the E&T article: “This group only achieved limitedresults, as measured by the concentration of the protein in the bloodstream ofthe mice. The second group, in a state of meditation or complete relaxation,induced a much higher rate of protein expression. The third group, using themethod of biofeedback, was able to consciously turn off and on the LED lightimplanted in the body of a test mouse.”Beyond the amazing implications for the influence of thought directly on geneactivities, this approach could someday be applied to help patients withepilepsy by instantaneously delivering drugs or switching certain genes on oroff in sufferers via a brain implant at the very onset of a seizure. Just beforea seizure, the epileptic brain generates a particular type of electricalactivity that could be used to activate a light-activated genetic implant torapidly produce an antiseizure drug. A similar strategy could be employed totreat chronic pain by producing painkilling drugs in the brain as soon as thefirst signs of pain occur.All in all, our genome is a fantastically nimble assembly of DNA and proteinsthat is constantly being remodeled in terms of structure and gene activity—andmuch of this remodeling appears to be in response to how we live our lives. Butthe Russian-doll problem cannot be swept aside. It’s apparent now thatchemically induced switches are at the root of shifting gene activity. That muchis indisputable. A switch in gene activity in response to one’s lifestyle can bebrought on by a small methyl group stuck on a gene, leaving a telltale mark.Without this chemical modification of the gene, a stem cell might not developinto a particular brain cell instead of a liver or a heart cell. Indeed, itmight not even develop into anything at all but just keep dividing over and overagain, the way a cancerous tumor forms.Methyl marks are not only chemical modifications turning off gene activity butare also like musical notes representing the symphony of more complex geneinteractions. By reading the marks as a group, we can get a sense of networks ofactivity that correspond to how we (and perhaps our parents and grandparents)lived. It might be possible to read directly from the epigenome the specificexperiences involved, like living through a famine. Looking at the marks as thescore of a symphony makes sense because it takes a multitude of notes beforemusic can really be grasped. Looking at one bar of a symphony provides only asnapshot. Likewise, trying to find the smallest Russian doll doesn’t tell youthe whole genetic story.In genetics, the marks are being deciphered chemically, but the step ofconnecting them to what they mean in terms of experience faces major challenges.First, we can’t actually observe genetic changes in real time. Second, we can’tconnect experience A to genetic change B with any specificity, except in a fewcases. It should be possible to find epigenetic alterations from cigarettesmoking, for example, yet even then, as we say, not everyone suffers the samedamage from the effects of smoking. While we know how chemical marks on certaingenes can come about, we cannot say how a certain type of life experience (e.g.,prolonged famine) causes specific marks to appear on specific genes inexquisitely precise areas of the genome.Presently, the biggest challenge remains the missing connection between marksand meaning. When a violinist sees the marks that begin Beethoven’s FifthSymphony—the familiar ta-ta-ta-DUM—he goes into action, moving his arm up anddown across the strings of the violin. You can see his arm move, but behind thisaction lie many invisible elements. The violinist knows what the notes standfor, having learned to read music. They aren’t just random black-and-white markson a page. His mind turns the notes into highly coordinated actions betweenbrain, eye, arm, and fingers. Finally, and hardly ever mentioned because it’s soobvious, a human being, Ludwig van Beethoven, was inspired to write the symphonyand invented the four-note motif known to the whole world. Hundreds of bars ofmusic are based on this simple group of notes.Even with this knowledge, how does the chemical choreography of millions ofgenes and their chemically controlled on/off switches deliver the amazingability of a brain to think? No one knows. How did the brain somehow evolve overeons in response to programming by newly arising mutations? Darwinian geneticswould say that all these mutations occurred randomly. But how could this be thewhole story, considering that epigenetic modifications in response to how welive our lives may well determine where in the genome new mutations arise? Insuch cases even Darwin would have to admit that not all mutations occurrandomly.Of course, Darwin could have no idea about epigenetics in his lifetime. But whatif he did? Darwin might then tell us that our evolution involves the interplayof both epigenetic marks and new gene mutations. Darwin shocked hiscontemporaries by excluding God, or any mindful Creator, from his explanation ofhow modern humans came to be. Certainly, in the study of genetics, assuming somekind of higher intelligence behind the scenes doesn’t help us to understand howwe evolved. But we can now consider an inherent organizing principle in theevolutionary process that transcends the single-minded concept of randommutations and survival of the fittest. In constructing a new model of evolution,methyl marks on thousands of genes and their histone partners, working hand inhand with the genome, would be helping determine where new mutations will arise(also by influencing the three-dimensional structure of DNA). Then Darwin’snatural selection can take over to decide which new mutations persist. In thisintriguing albeit speculative scenario, we aren’t just blowing in the windwaiting for random mutations to arise. We are directly influencing the futureevolution of our genome based on the choices we make.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Note: The DNA between the genes used to be called “junk” DNA. However, we nowknow that the DNA between genes (or intergenic DNA) can be used to produce tinymolecules called micro-RNAs, which control gene activities throughout thegenome."},{"pageContent":"A NEW POWER PLAYER: THE MICROBIOMEGenetics is in the midst of a knowledge explosion. The data pouring in about thegenome and epigenome are piling up every day, not in gigabytes but in terabytes,meaning a trillion bytes of digital information, a thousand times larger than agigabyte. This mountain of data is difficult to fathom, much less analyze, andanother Himalayan range was added from a direction no one anticipated: microbes.In medical school, microbes are chiefly seen as invaders, the bacteria andviruses that cause disease when they break through the body’s immune defenses.Off to the side, as it were, friendly microbes were also pointed out, those thatlive in the intestinal tract, serving to digest the food we consume.A physician who specializes in gastrointestinal medicine becomes very familiarwith what can go wrong in the gut, but most people have very little awareness ofthe microbes that live side by side with our own cells. Antibiotics, whosepurpose is to kill disease-causing germs, also attack the friendly flora in thegut. Normally, these friendly flora restore themselves after a short period oncethe antibiotic is gone, and the most you’d notice is a bout of diarrhea. Whentravelers suffer intestinal upsets like “Delhi belly” in India or “Montezuma’srevenge” in Mexico, the cause is a change in the ecology of the intestine.Digestive microbes are different in different parts of the world. Unless youfeel pain, discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation, you’re not likely topay much attention to your digestion, certainly not at the microbial level.In the past few years, however, the whole population of microbes that inhabit ushas assumed enormous importance, almost out of the blue. We hinted at the reasonin passing when we mentioned that the body contains 100 trillion foreign ormicrobial cells. As we’ve already mentioned, this means that 90 percent of thebody’s cells are microbes, including a vast preponderance of its geneticmaterial. Your body contains about 23,000 human genes, in contrast to over 1million bacterial genes. In a word, we are a collection of bacterial colonieswith a few human cells hanging on! This realization dawned when it becamepossible to map entire genomes, including the genomes of the hundreds andthousands of possible microbial species that inhabit the body, chiefly in thegut but also on the skin, in the mouth, and in other locations.Before we can understand our own genes, it’s necessary to grasp the geneticimplications of the microbiome, the label given to the total ecology ofmicro-organisms, which outnumber our cells 10 to 1 (microbiota is also used as asynonym). These microbes didn’t just drop in for a visit when higher life-formsappeared. The symbiotic relationship between the cells of our body and trillionsof microbes spans vast periods of time, beginning with the first appearance ofmicrobes 3.5 billion years ago; the emergence of our hominid ancestors around2.5 million years ago represents the blink of an eye in the evolutionary marchof bacteria, which can create genes and even exchange them. Along the way, ourinteraction with these bacteria influenced the evolution of every organ,including the brain. It hasn’t been determined how many species of microbes arepresent in our body; the general estimates rise to more than a thousand—in anycase, a bewildering multitude. The impact of the microbiome is suggested by theways it’s been described: “the second human genome”; “a newly discovered organ”;“a bacterial inner rain forest.” In the gut, cells are shed in vast numbers:around 100 million to 300 million are shed by the colon per hour, a smallfraction of the 1 to 3 billion shed by the small intestine. Microbes establishthemselves in the biofilm coating the intestinal wall, but they are also shed inquantity—a stool sample contains about 40 percent microbes by weight.The term microbiome was introduced by a Nobel Prize–winning molecular biologistand past colleague of Rudy, Joshua Lederberg, but the notion of a microbiome wasfirst described by a U.S. Army surgeon in the nineteenth century, WilliamBeaumont (1785–1853), a pioneer in the physiology of digestion. He proclaimedthat anger hinders digestion. We have since learned that the vast array of gutbacteria directly affects the development of the brain and the central nervoussystem from the womb to death. In addition, your microbiome is adjusting yourimmune system every day.When the natural balance of the microbiome becomes disrupted and unbalanced, wecall it dysbiosis, yet only now is it being discovered that far from being justa digestive problem, dysbiosis is systemic in the damage it causes. The range ofdisorders linked to it is growing but is already startling in its numbers: linkshave been found to asthma, eczema, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, autism,Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, obesity, cardiovasculardisease, atherosclerosis, cancer, and malnutrition. Avenues for new treatmentsare leading down the same road—to the microbiome.Excitement over the microbiome has reached such a fever pitch that you’veprobably become aware of it through the media and through products calledprobiotics (the most widely advertised is active yogurt), which are advantageousin promoting the growth of healthy microbes in the intestinal tract. From agenetics viewpoint, the microbiome helps to educate the immune system and toprevent disease. Over the eons of evolution, microbial DNA hasn’t simply livedside by side with the DNA inside living creatures but has infiltrated it,becoming an integral part of human DNA today. A world of possible findings stemsfrom this interdependence, which has been continuing for millions of years inour species.The other important story, the connection between the microbiome and chronicdiseases, is likely to have a major impact on everyone’s life, and it could comequite quickly. There is a natural connection with disorders of the intestinaltract such as irritable bowel syndrome. Obesity is also a natural fit throughhow food gets digested and metabolized. Far more unexpected is the potentiallink between the microbiome and far-flung disorders like heart disease, type 1diabetes, cancer, and even mental illnesses like schizophrenia.It’s now known that gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds that interactwith brain cells and which can even control the expression of our own genesthrough epigenetics. Once it was realized that there is a strong gut-brainconnection, the barriers between our own cells and foreign cells began tocrumble. If a bacterium in your intestine can actually influence your mood orcontribute to mental illness, a totally new conception of the body looms on thehorizon, as we’ll explain. (We will discuss probiotics and other dietaryrecommendations in Part Two, “Lifestyle Choices.”)FROM MYSTERY TO CRAZEBecause hundreds of microbes inhabit your body, their genomes and the terabytesof data derived from them pose a huge mystery. To help make sense of it, we needsome general categories to wrap our minds around. Professor Rob Knight, anexpert in human microbes at the University of Colorado, introduces themicrobiome by saying, “The three pounds of microbes that you carry around withyou might be more important than every single gene you carry around in yourgenome.” By weight, the microbiome roughly equals the brain. Knight simplifiesthe teeming population of micro-organisms by clustering them in the primaryareas they occupy around the body, the chief ones being the intestines, skin,mouth, and vagina. These are like separate microbial—and genetic—landscapes, asdistinct in their ecology as the Arctic is distinct from the tropics. Behindthis simplified map lies Knight’s analysis of the microbiome of 250 healthyadult volunteers, and behind that the huge database of genome sequencing by the$173 million Human Microbiome Project funded by the federal government.One of the chief mysteries about the microbiome is that it varies so much fromperson to person. In a February 2014 TED talk that has accumulated over 300,000viewings, Knight tantalizes with some intriguing facts. Some people swear thatthey get bitten by mosquitoes much more than other people, while some claim theyare rarely bitten. The reason partly has to do with the different microbes ontheir skin and how much mosquitoes are attracted to them. Microbes in theintestine also seem to determine whether an over-the-counter pain medicationlike Tylenol (acetaminophen) might cause liver damage.Diversity makes it difficult to describe the population of a perfectly healthymicrobiome. On the negative side, modern guts may be severely compromised. In aninfluential 2014 paper, Stanford University microbiologists Erica and JustinSonnenburg sounded a message about the possible loss of gut microbes due tovarious factors. One is the Western diet low in vegetable fiber. Fiber is aprebiotic, a food that microbes need to feed on if they are to flourish (asopposed to a probiotic, which introduces new microbes into the digestive tract).The widespread use of antibiotics also has a destructive effect on a spectrum ofbacteria and viruses. Less tangible but suspicious is our modern stressfullifestyle, because stress hormones and emotions in general can cause shifts inthe microbiome. Like your gene activity, your microbiome is so dynamic that itshould be thought of as a verb, not a noun.The most disturbing suggestion by the Sonnenburgs is that modern Western dietsare crucial in the rise of chronic diseases and especially autoimmune disorderslike allergies. The microbiome helps regulate immunity, and it also produceschemical by-products during the digestive process that reduce inflammation. Moreand more evidence is mounting that links inflammation to a host of disorders,including heart disease, hypertension, and various cancers. Reducing thediversity of the gut’s ecology could be steadily ruining our health. TheSonnenburgs explicitly declare the risks: “It is possible that the Westernmicrobiota is actually dysbiotic [harmful to microbes] and predisposesindividuals to a variety of diseases.”As with many issues surrounding the microbiome, these risks are very difficultto validate with total certainty. There are only a few isolated populationsaround the world whose microbiome is free of damaging influences. Emily Eakin,writing for The New Yorker in December 2014, cites the Hadza tribe in Africa,who have been studied by Jeff Leach, an anthropologist who is collaborating withthe Sonnenburgs. Three hundred Hadza, who still live in hunter-gathererconditions in Tanzania, were Leach’s subjects for a year. “We need to go toplaces where people don’t have ready access to antibiotics, where people stilldrink water from the same sources that zebra, giraffes, and elephants drinkfrom, and who still live outside,” Leach told Eakin. These are the conditions inwhich the genes of Homo sapiens developed.Using stool samples, Leach found that “it looks like the Hadza have one of themost diverse gut ecosystems in the world of any population that’s been studied.”Yet a previous study of the Hadza by researchers from the Max Planck Institutefor Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany disclosed that while they harboredcertain gut bacteria never seen before, the Hadza lacked others that areassociated with good health in the Western microbiome. Leach believed enough inthe genetic superiority of the Hadza gut, however, that he transplanted a sampleof their microbiome into his intestinal tract.This leads to a craze that has gone viral despite the fact that so much of themicrobiome is up in the air. The way that Leach transplanted the Hadza’smicrobes was by using a turkey baster to inject their feces into his colon.However distasteful, even repellent, this sounds, there are YouTube videosinstructing how to do the same to yourself. The basis for this DIY procedure issimple logic. If a Western adult microbiome is compromised, that of a newbornbaby or healthy young child isn’t. Why not exchange one for the other?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stepped in to prevent fecalmicrobiota transplantation (FMT) by doctors until official trials are conductedalong the same lines as introducing a new drug. Such is the enthusiasm for FMTs,however, that the practice has gone underground, and there are no prohibitionson its use by doctors in other countries. The FDA’s ruling put an immediate stopto small-scale research that lacks the financing to pursue exorbitantlyexpensive trials lasting typically from seven to ten years. But the FDA, asEakin reports, was stung by the thousands of people who developed acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) through blood transfusions before it was knownthat blood was a means of transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Disease organisms like the virus that causes hepatitis A are harbored in thegut. (In the case of hepatitis A, infected fecal matter must enter the mouth ofsomeone who isn’t immune to the disease; this usually happens in unsanitaryconditions with food handlers.) This and other risks as yet unknown make the FDAruling appropriately cautious.Performing an FMT is like taking the donor’s entire microbiome without knowingwhat it contains. No one should take such a risk. But the underground fad forFMT, messy and off-putting as the whole procedure is, rests on the enormouspotential of the microbiome to reverse so many chronic illnesses. One strikingexample is Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that can be totallydebilitating. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, which can lead to severe weightloss, along with abdominal pain and fever. Victims of Crohn’s disease tend tolead miserable lives, held captive by their illness. Because the root cause isinflammation of an unexplained origin, there can be inflammatory problemsoutside the intestinal tract as well, such as skin rashes, red and swollen eyes,and even diabetes.Drug therapies are often ineffective in Crohn’s disease, and in severe cases themost damaged sections of intestine are surgically removed. But going back to the1950s, isolated physicians, generally considered renegades or worse, believedthat treating Crohn’s patients with fecal matter from healthy donors (takenunder sanitary conditions by pill or through the rectum) produced actual cures,often in a remarkably short period of time, meaning weeks and months. Nowtreating Crohn’s disease through FMT could go mainstream, and even the FDA madean exception for it in their ruling against the procedure.Even more startling is a condition that FMT seems to cure in a matter of hours,even when a patient is close to dying. The condition is a bacterial infection ofClostridium difficile, which arises in connection with strong doses ofantibiotics. Up to half a million people currently suffer from the infection,with more than ten thousand dying annually in severe cases. C. difficile resistsantibiotics and typically is found when a hospitalized patient being treatedwith a heavy course of antibiotics has had severe depletion of their microbiome.The conditions are then ripe for C. difficile, with the infection causingsymptoms similar to Crohn’s disease, including severe diarrhea.Ironically, the standard treatment for C. difficile is to give vancomycin, anantibiotic. Vancomycin can be totally ineffective if a new, resistant strain ofthe bacteria has emerged. But the medical literature contains scattered reportsof remarkable, almost instant recovery using FMT. Within hours, the newlyinserted microbes defeat and crowd out C. difficile, leading to a subsiding ofall symptoms. The FDA has also made an exception in this case. By extension, ifan FMT can heal two disorders that share the same symptom—highly destructiveinflammation—and if inflammation is potentially the villain in chronic diseasesof many types, why not take a chance and perform our own FMT, using thehealthiest stool you can convince someone to donate? This is the logic that madehome FMT go viral.No one has proved that taking such a step is either good science or effectivemedicine, and we are certainly not condoning it. (There are other, safer ways tooptimize your microbiome, as we’ll see.) But findings in animal trials indicatethat a true revolution may be brewing. In 2006 a team from Washington Universityin St. Louis apparently proved a strong connection between the microbiome andobesity. They took mice that had been genetically altered to be obese andtransferred some of their microbes to normal mice. Those mice became obese,which is the first time that a disorder has been transferred via the microbiome,at least in animals. But what’s truly startling is that the mice who grew fatafter receiving the microbes ate the same diet as mice without the transplant,and yet the untreated mice didn’t grow fat.How did the same caloric intake produce fat mice and normal mice at the sametime? It’s presumed that the inserted microbes were somehow more efficient atextracting nutrients from the food as it was being digested. This runs counterto a long-held belief that calories in equal calories out. In other words, if ameal contains a thousand calories, everyone’s body, given complete, healthydigestion, will extract a thousand calories of energy. Yet we all know peoplewho say, “I only have to look at a piece of chocolate cake to gain a pound.”Provocatively, this new study suggests that they have a point. Some microbiomesmay work better at nutrient extraction than others, with obese people extractingtoo much and skinny people extracting too little.Researchers in Amsterdam wanted to see if a fecal transplant of microbes fromlean people into fat people would be enough to cause them to lose weight. Sofar, it hasn’t been. The subjects showed improved insulin sensitivity (key towhether calories are properly metabolized instead of being stored as fat), butthey didn’t lose weight, and the benefit was gone after a year. It may be thatmore treatments are needed or that specific microbes need to be isolated from“lean” microbiomes. The whole genetic story has yet to be told, however, and itcould prove far more complicated.ENTERING A NEW ECOLOGYAs you can see, adjectives like foreign, alien, and invasive are not applicableto the microbes that have learned to cooperate with the human body over millionsof years. There are indications that a baby’s normal development may depend onthem. Going back to Professor Rob Knight’s simplified map, there are differentmicroecologies located in the mouth, intestines (feces), skin, and vagina.Before a baby is born, its body has no microbes; the gastrointestinal (GI) tractis actually sterile. As it passes through the vaginal canal, the baby receives afilmy coating of the mother’s microbiome from that area. Birth is just the firststep in exposing a baby to microbes, which it will take in from every direction:the mother’s breast, food, water, air, pets, and other people. The GI tractbegins to be colonized within hours after birth. Animal studies have shown thatwhen raised in a sanitized, microbe-free environment, animals develop a range ofabnormalities from immune deficiency and shrunken heart to improper switching inbrain cells, along with the expected digestive problems.Sometime in childhood the microbiome ceases to be in constant flux. Itstabilizes, although not in the same way for everyone. On Knight’s chart, theprogress of the early microbiome moves from the skin-vagina region at birth tothe intestinal-fecal region. This sequence is true for everyone, because a gutthat can digest food is universal. But there is evidence that the more exposureto microbes, the better, which is a kind of paradox. Children raised indeveloping countries exhibit much more diversity in their microbiome, furtheringthe probability that we live “too clean” in the developed West. But suchchildren also suffer from more childhood diseases, just as kids who are left inday care may, it seems, be less prone to allergies but also run the risk ofcatching more colds, earaches, flu, and other transmissible diseases.In epigenetics, as we’ve seen, the biggest problem is the absence ofstraight-line cause and effect. A doesn’t lead to B when a cloud of causespresses in on the mind-body system. With the microbiome, the big problem is howrapidly it changes. Genes are far more stuck, even taking the epigenome intoaccount, than the microbes that inhabit us. Imagine the ocean shoreline as wavesbeat against the land, constantly moving the sand. Tides and weather determinehow much sand is taken away or deposited. If the grains of sand were livingmicrobes, the tides and weather of the gut are constantly moving microbesaround, flushing some out and allowing others to enter.Using the word ecology may sound like a metaphor, but medicine is only beginningto understand that the intestinal tract, which is roughly twenty-five feet longand has a surface area comparable to a tennis court, is as complex and dynamicas the global ecology. It’s estimated that the microbiome has somewhere between40 and 150 times more genes than the body itself. As an example of whatsurprises lie in store for explorers of this ecology, let’s consider a disorderthat is now being strongly connected to microbes: obesity.The timeworn model of “calories in, calories out” puts the onus for obesity on aperson’s eating habits. If you eat too much, for whatever reason, your bodystores the excess calories as fat. Studies do in fact show that overeaters tendto underestimate how many calories they consume. But if overeating were the onlycause of obesity, it doesn’t explain why only 2 percent of dieters successfullytake off at least five pounds and keep it off for two years. What’s forcingtheir hand? One possibility is the stuckness of bad habits, which causes the oldeating patterns to creep back into a dieter’s life. But weight gain has beenassociated with a variety of influences. The following list isn’t meant to alarmor depress you, only to illustrate how complex the natural activity of eatinghas become.WHY PEOPLE GAIN WEIGHTThey overeat.They come from a family of overeaters, with a possible genetic connection.Their friends overeat.Their diets contain too much refined sugar, simple carbohydrates, and fat.They consume too few fresh fruits and vegetables and other sources of solublefiber.They eat processed, junk, and fast food that contains additives and artificialingredients, along with excessive salt and sugar.They develop a range of bad eating habits: watching TV while eating, eating toofast, snacking between meals, and so forth.Their lives are stressful.They are undergoing a personal crisis, such as being fired or getting a divorce.There is an imbalance between the two hormones (leptin and ghrelin) responsiblefor making someone feel hungry and full.Their brains show inflammation or damage to the hypothalamus, the center forregulating appetite.Their bodies exhibit signs of chronic inflammation.They’ve given up on losing weight after years of yo-yo dieting.They recently quit smoking and overeat to compensate.With so many factors at work, usually in concert, it becomes abundantly clearwhy obesity remains difficult to treat. One disorder overlaps the separatefields of nutrition, endocrinology, genetics, gastroenterology, psychiatry, andsociology, each having its own perspective. The cloud of causes looms heavily.Yet through all these complex influences one thread may be pulled out: themicrobiome, which primarily digests food but also exerts a major effect onhormones, immunity, stress response, and chronic inflammation. There is no otherfactor that encompasses so many bodily functions.The trail of clues leads from food to gut to the whole body. Someone who hasfollowed the trail is Dr. Paresh Dandona, a diabetes specialist at the StateUniversity of New York at Buffalo’s School of Medicine. Dandona had a major cluefall into his lap when curiosity led him to examine the food at McDonald’s. Ninevolunteers who were of normal weight consumed typical McDonald’s breakfast fare:an egg sandwich with cheese and ham, a sausage muffin sandwich, and two hashbrown patties, which totaled 910 calories. There are well-known reasons besidescalories why such a breakfast, high in fat and salt while containing almost nofiber, is unhealthy. Dandona added something quite unexpected. As reported inMother Jones magazine in April 2013:> Levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of systemic inflammation, shot up> “within literally minutes….I was shocked,” [Dandona] recalls, that “a simple> McDonald’s meal that seems harmless enough”—the sort of high-fat,> high-carbohydrate meal that 1 in 4 Americans eats regularly—would have such a> dramatic effect. And it lasted for [five] hours.Using a phrase like “harmless enough” reflects the somewhat laissez-faireattitude taken toward fast food by many Americans. (Besides causing an upsurgein inflammation, consuming a Big Mac rapidly injects fats into the bloodstreamthat can be observed as visible clouding in the serum [clear liquid] after thered corpuscles are centrifuged out.) Dandona’s research took a major turn, andhe made even more startling discoveries.Over the next decade Dandona examined various foods to see how they affected theimmune system, which is known to be compromised by chronic low-levelinflammation. Reporter Moises Velasquez-Manoff writes, “A fast-food breakfastinflamed, [Dandona] found, but a high-fiber breakfast with lots of fruit didnot. A breakthrough came in 2007 when he discovered that while sugar water, astand-in for soda, caused inflammation, orange juice—even though it containsplenty of sugar—didn’t.” Somehow fresh, unprocessed orange juice counteractedeven the 910-calorie McDonald’s breakfast splurge. Among the test subjects, thebreakfast caused inflammation and elevated blood sugar whether they accompaniedthe meal with sugar water or plain water. Yet neither effect showed up among thesubjects drinking orange juice.Velasquez-Manoff continues. “Orange juice is rich in antioxidants like vitaminC, beneficial flavonoids, and small amounts of fiber, all of which may bedirectly anti-inflammatory. But what caught Dandona’s attention was anothersubstance.” This was a molecule called endotoxin (literally “inner poison”) thatappeared in blood after eating the McDonald’s breakfast among the subjectsdrinking water and sugar water but not among the orange juice group. Endotoxinis produced by the outer membrane of bacteria, and its presence in thebloodstream signals the immune system to go into action, with resultinginflammation. Dandona suspected that the source of the endotoxin was themicrobiome. The endotoxin got into the bloodstream by being ushered therethrough the intestinal wall by the McDonald’s food. The orange juice somehowkept the endotoxin inside the gut, where it’s naturally found. (More research on“leaky gut syndrome” is deepening the connection to diet.)Orange juice isn’t a panacea or unique in its effect; there could be a widerange of foods that counteract chronic inflammation. In the face of anever-shifting microbial ecology, some constant influences may be enough tochange the course of a person’s well-being. But what’s needed is more than akitchen cupboard of beneficial foods, important as that is. (See this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page121], where we recommend the bestmicrobiome diet, as far as current research indicates.)FROM CLUES TO CASCADESDandona’s findings, among others, do more than reinforce the standardrecommendation that a balanced diet should contain soluble fiber from wholefruits and vegetables, along with whole grains. The prospect of reversingunhealthy inflammation is exciting. Advances come from unexpected places. It’sbeen observed that the inflammatory molecule endotoxin decreases in thebloodstream after someone undergoes gastric bypass surgery. Gastric bypass is aprocedure that reduces the stomach to a small pouch about the size of an egg.The small intestine is directly connected to this pouch, and as the result ofhaving a severely reduced stomach, patients eat less and therefore can losedramatic amounts of weight.That was the accepted explanation, except that the reduction of inflammationpoints to the microbiome. In a series of tests with rats and mice, a team fromMassachusetts General Hospital produced a remarkable result. They performedgastric bypass on the rodents, and afterward their microbiome completely resetitself. A surge of beneficial microbes not only reduced inflammation but leddirectly to weight loss. This cause-and-effect sequence was shown by taking themicrobes from these gastric-bypass animals and inserting them into theintestines of germ-free mice. The injected mice lost weight while still eatingtheir previous high-caloric diet. In fact, they lost weight while consuming morecalories than did a control group of mice that lost no weight. This result helpsto debunk the long-accepted belief that weight gain and weight loss are entirelyabout calories. It also points to another intriguing possibility. As part of themicrobial resetting, the gastric-bypass and injected mice were able tometabolize glucose, or blood sugar, in a normal, healthy fashion, which wasn’ttrue of the mice that lost weight by eating less. Considering how human dietersalmost always regain the weight they lose, it may be that the problem isn’tabout returning to the “wrong” diet, losing willpower, or secretly consuming toomany calories. It may be, as with these mice, that it takes a reset of metabolicprocesses controlled by the microbiome.We’ll go into this subject in depth in Part Two, which covers lifestyle changes,but it’s worthwhile to summarize the possibilities here.WHAT WOULD RESET YOUR MICROBIOME?Eating less fat, sugar, and refined carbohydratesAdding sufficient prebiotics on which bacteria feed: fiber from whole fruits,vegetables, and grainsAvoiding chemically processed foodsEliminating alcohol consumptionTaking a probiotic supplement (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page124])Eating probiotic foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and picklesReducing foods with inflammatory effectsFocusing on foods with anti-inflammatory effects, like freshly squeezed orangejuiceDiligent stress managementAttending to “inflamed” emotions like anger and hostilityWe want to emphasize that these are all possibilities rather than certainties.The microbiome reaches beyond digestion into every part of the body. Thereforeits effects are extremely complicated, and further research is continuallyneeded. What’s known so far, however, looks very promising.For example, much disease seems to be the result of a cascade of processes inthe body, meaning a chain of events that follow one upon the other, creatingmore problems as the cascade progresses. For example, mice raised without theirnormal complement of microbes can gorge on food without gaining weight, owing toinadequate digestion. But if put back in with other mice so that they acquire anormal microbe colony, the gorging mice run into trouble. The excess caloriesare now being digested and have to be stored as fat. Their livers become insulinresistant, and the animals become obese even on fewer calories.The same cascade can also be produced through endotoxin. Belgian researchers ledby Professor Patrice Cani gave mice small doses of endotoxin, which caused theirlivers to become insulin resistant. Obesity followed and then diabetes. Thissequence pointed to the possibility that leaks from the microbiome might be amajor factor in human obesity, exacerbated by overeating and eating the wrongfoods. “Then came the bombshell,” Velasquez-Manoff writes. “The mere addition ofsoluble plant fibers called oligosaccharides, found in things like bananas,garlic, and asparagus, prevented the entire cascade—no endotoxin, noinflammation, and no diabetes.” Cani had found a means of preventing the damageby something equivalent to Dandona’s orange juice: fiber. When certain solublefibers are intact when they reach the colon, where the bulk of digestivemicrobes live, the bacteria break the fiber down as food. Thus a prebiotic, anecessary precursor to a healthy microbiome, stopped the disease cascade in itstracks. Fiber is noncaloric, but as microbes break it down, beneficialsubstances are released, including acetic acid, butyric acid, B vitamins, andvitamin K. (Also worth recalling are the mouse trials at Washington University,in which transplanting microbes from obese mice caused normal mice to becomeobese without overeating.) Following is a summary list of the implications ofthis research into the gut-inflammation connection.THE GUT-INFLAMMATION CONNECTIONFatty, high-carbohydrate foods promote inflammatory substances in thebloodstream.Endotoxin and other harmful molecules released by certain bacteria can leakthrough the intestinal wall.If such leakage takes place, an immune response is triggered, and inflammationresults.Inflammation disturbs, among other things, blood sugar levels and the liver’sinsulin response.When that happens, obesity may occur even on a diet containing a normal amountof calories.Orange juice and soluble fiber shift the balance toward a beneficial microbiomeand counteract the cascade that follows from a “leaky gut.”Many researchers now feel that the gut-inflammation connection has uncovered amajor source of chronic disease, not just obesity. Links to diabetes,hypertension, heart disease, and cancer are being vigorously pursued. “If wetake care of our gut microbiota, it will take care of our health,” Cani says. “Ilike to finish my talks with one sentence: ‘In gut we trust.’ ”When you explore the fast-mounting studies on the microbiome, thegut-inflammation connection becomes even more important. Liping Zhao, a Chinesemicrobiologist, told his own story to the journal Science in June 2012, part ofa special issue devoted to the microbiome. In “My Microbiome and Me,” Zhaopresented himself as a human guinea pig who reversed his own obesity, high levelof “bad” cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure by switching to a diet strongin whole grains along with two foods taken to be beneficial in Chinese medicine,bitter melon and Chinese yam. Losing forty-four pounds in two years isimpressive, but Zhao had suspected a connection between obesity and inflammationin 2004. It seems highly significant that in his own case, one microbe,Faecalibacterium prausnitzii—a bacterium that has anti-inflammatoryproperties—flourished in his gut, increasing from an undetectable percentage to14.5 percent of Zhao’s total gut bacteria.The changes persuaded him to focus on the microbiome’s role in histransformation. Mouse trials followed, then human trials. One patient who wasmorbidly obese, weighing 385 pounds at age twenty-six, experienced many of thesame benefits as Zhao, shedding over 100 pounds in a year. Once more there was aspecific microbe involved. A single bacterium, Enterobacter cloacae, known tocreate inflammation, made up more than one-third of the patient’s microbiome. Inthis patient, on Zhao’s diet it dwindled to trace amounts, whileanti-inflammatory microbes increased.Targeting specific disease processes and “bad” microbes may not be necessary inreversing obesity. One study looked at four pairs of identical twins in whichone twin was lean and the other fat. Mice received gut microbes from one or theother twin, and the mice that received the microbes from the fat twin becameobese, with a thicker layer of fat. We’ll look at the implications of this keyfinding for your own diet in Part Two, on lifestyle.This book is about genes, not the microbiome, but it’s now impossible to discussgenes without it. Your microbiome is, in essence, your second genome. But unlikeyour own genome, your microbiome is contagious, because you can spread yourbacteria to others. And while this may sound a bit gross, the exchange ofbacteria between people through intimate contact can benefit the population.Some evolutionists have gone so far as to propose that human social behaviorbasically evolved to promote the sharing of microbes. Increasing resistance toinfections and dietary toxins could be a dominant factor. In vegetarian speciesof animals, the microbiome is primarily for digesting a plant diet, but raw meatfrom a lion kill, for example, is likely to be filled with parasites, diseaseorganisms, and toxins, so a carnivore’s microbiome protects the creature fromthese. Human evolution picked up from there to maximize our disease resistanceto its present level.THE GUT-BRAIN AXISWith a wealth of gut genomes so vastly outnumbering our own, the microbiomeexerts a powerful influence beyond digestion and metabolism. Most fascinating,perhaps, is the “gut brain.” Christine Tara Peterson, Ph.D., who has examinedthis area in depth (she is also associated with the Chopra Center, doingadvanced research on the microbiome), points out that the gut harbors 100million neurons, more than the spinal cord, and produces 95 percent of thebody’s serotonin, one of the most crucial neurotransmitters, whose levels areconnected, it’s long been thought, to depression.The brain’s main line of communication to every region of the body is via twelvecranial nerves. One is the vagus nerve, named for the Latin word for“wandering.” Its wanderings are extensive, beginning at the medulla oblongata inthe lower brain, passing down the neck, past the heart, and into the digestivetract. Around 80 percent of all the sensory information that reaches the brainis transmitted via the vagus nerve as it branches out. What’s intriguing for ourpurposes is that 90 percent of the traffic, Peterson says, is from gut to brain.“The microbiome,” she points out, “may be impacting mental states like anxietyor autism.”The clues are hard to follow, however, because few labs are set up to follow thetrail of molecular messages from the gut to the brain. But it’s accepted thatgut-brain access is a two-way street. The bacteria in your intestinal tractaffect the workings of your brain, having a potential to alter emotions, eventhe risk for neurological and psychiatric disease. In turn, your mood and stresslevel affect the bacteria that will live in your microbiome. What’s come tofruition is an idea proposed early on by the eminent psychologist William James,working with a physiologist, Carl Lange, in the 1880s. They held that emotionsarise because the brain is interpreting signals or reactions from the body. Inupdated form, this has turned into a feedback loop between brain and body usingchemical messages.Beginning as far back as 1974, studies of baby monkeys have shown thatseparation from their mothers at birth is more than psychologicallydistressing—it changes their gut microflora. In a related study in which babymice were separated from their mothers, they became more anxious compared withthose that stayed with their mothers. Yet when the intestinal tracts of thematernally separated mice were recolonized with bacteria from the mice thatstayed with their mothers, the anxiety of the separated mice dissipated. Theseresults apparently extend to humans as well. If the gut bacteria from humanpatients with irritable bowel syndrome are placed in the gut of mice, the micebecome socially inept and anxious. Emotional distress has long been associatedwith irritable bowel syndrome, and now it seems that the connection has amaterial basis, not simply a psychological one.In another study, a Dutch team has shown that if new mothers are stressed, theirstress actually changes the microbiome of their infants. It seems highlyplausible, then, that chronic social stress could be changing your intestinalbacteria, creating a destructive feedback loop between gut and brain that causesinflammation throughout the system, including the brain. It’s fair to say thatwhile modern medicine has focused for more a century on killing bacteria, we’renow learning to live healthier lives with them.Whether or not you find all this talk about gut bacteria distasteful, anyone canbe forgiven for feeling humbled by it. We humans are used to seeing ourselves asabove other creatures, certainly above micro-organisms that are the mostprimitive life-forms on Earth. These microbes have moved from parasites topartners. Theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman has rightly said, “All evolutionis co-evolution,” while the pioneering quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger oncedeclared, “No self is of itself alone…the ‘I’ is chained to ancestry by manyfactors.”But finding our evolution tied to microbes can be reframed so that it’s not atall humbling. Inside our bodies, through our own genome and the genomes ofmicrobes, is contained the entire history of life on Earth. Every person is abiological encyclopedia; every generation writes a new page or chapter. Sincethe body you see in the mirror is life itself, the need to preserve the ecologybecomes much more necessary, because the ecology is no longer “out there.” Whatyou eat for lunch today is on the same level as saving the rain forest orreducing greenhouse gases, a form of self-preservation that cannot be put off assomeone else’s problem. In that light, Part Two will describe how a radicalredefinition of the body leads to a new lifestyle and the fruit of thatlifestyle, radical well-being."},{"pageContent":"PART TWO[images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_007_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_007_r1.jpg]LIFESTYLE CHOICES FOR RADICAL WELL-BEINGDiet [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page119]Stress [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml#page145]Exercise [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c009_r1.xhtml#page159]Meditation [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#page171]Sleep [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml#page186]Emotions [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page201]"},{"pageContent":"What makes the new genetics astonishing is that it has caused us to realizesomething that’s easy to forget. Nothing is more remarkable than the human body.It changes dynamically with every experience, responding with perfect precisionto life’s challenges—if only we let it. Beyond normal health and vitality, yourbody is the platform for radical well-being. Every cell is prepared for thistransformation, powered by the super genome, but our mind hasn’t been. Now youhave the knowledge in hand, and we hope you’ve accepted a much more expandedview of possibilities.You need to awaken these possibilities. As long as people’s lifestyles had nogenetic consequences, the only proven approach to greater well-being wasstandard prevention. Now, with two major breakthroughs—epigenetics and themicrobiome—our genes can say yes to a broad range of positive changes. Any genehas the potential to become a super gene when it cooperates with our intentionsand desires. Personal evolution needs this cooperation, or we can’t moveforward.All well-being, whether radical or not, contains two simple steps.First, find out what’s good for you and what’s bad.Second, do what’s good for you while avoiding what’s bad.When it comes to the first step, a lack of knowledge—along with a host ofmistaken beliefs masked as knowledge—had to be overcome in the new genetics. Ifyou know, as we now do, that only 5 percent or less of disease-related genemutations are fully penetrant (deterministic), that leaves 95 percent open tochange in their activities.The second step is about implementing your knowledge, and here is where thebiggest challenges lie. Standard prevention, with its well-known risk factorsand familiar advice, has broadcast the same healthy message for more than fortyyears. Why, then, aren’t people healthier than ever? Cancer death rates havedecreased only marginally since the 1930s, despite some dramatic successes withearly detection. Smoking remains a problem for 25 percent of the population, andobesity rates keep rising. The devil, it turns out, isn’t in the details; it’sin the denial.Deepak attended a conference recently on the benefits of meditation in which thenews was remarkably promising. The speaker, a world-famous genetics researcher,was focusing on how meditation produced beneficial gene activity through theepigenome (we’ll talk more about the relationship between meditation and yourgenome later). When the period for questions came, someone in the audienceasked, “Given all of these fantastic findings, do you meditate?”“No,” the researcher replied.The questioner was shocked. “Why not?”“Because,” the speaker said, “I’m looking to develop a pill that will bring thesame results.”He got a laugh, but being humorous about your noncompliance leads to the sameoutcome as other kinds of denial. Motivating people to do what’s good for themand to avoid what’s bad must be the first order of business. We all contend withthe voice in our head that saysI’ll get around to it later.It’s too much trouble.I’m probably all right anyway.Would it really make that much difference?The “it” can be anything you know needs improvement—a better diet, regularexercise, stress reduction, and so on. Sometimes denial doesn’t need any voicemaking excuses. A kind of convenient amnesia sets in when we’re tempted by apiece of chocolate cake, which we’re not even hungry for, or by a favorite TVshow that makes us forget to take a walk after dinner.Let’s do a quick spot check on your present situation. Following is a quiz intwo parts—the first part is about doing what’s good for your genome, the secondabout avoiding what’s bad. We want you to self-assess as honestly as you can.Your answers will serve as a good preparation for the lifestyle choices outlinedin this section of the book.We begin with the lifestyle habits that send positive messages to your genome.QUIZ (PART 1): THE LIFE YOUR GENES WANTPUT A CHECK BESIDE EACH ITEM THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS (90 PERCENT OF THE TIME) TRUEABOUT YOU.___ I allow my life to unfold naturally, without a hectic schedule and constantdemands.___ I get sufficient sleep every night (at least 8 hours) and wake up feelingrefreshed.___ I follow a regular but not rigid daily routine.___ I pay attention to staying in balance with my diet, eating from all thehealthy food groups.___ I avoid toxic food, air, and water, including food loaded with artificialingredients.___ I don’t skip meals.___ I don’t snack.___ I take steps to minimize my stress and manage the stresses that areunavoidable.___ I give myself some time out every day to let my body reset itself.___ I meditate.___ I do yoga.___ I eat moderately and maintain a healthy weight.___ I avoid long periods of sitting, moving my body at least once an hour.___ I don’t smoke.___ I drink alcohol sparingly or not at all.___ I avoid red meat, and if I do eat it, I do so sparingly.___ I do my best to eat only organic foods.___ I am physically active.___ I understand the danger of chronic inflammation and take steps to avoid it.___ I place a high value on my own well-being and practice self-care every day.Score: _____­_____­ (0 to 20)Now assess the negative side, the lifestyle habits that send the wrong messagesto your genome.QUIZ (PART 2): THE LIFE YOUR GENES DON’T WANTPUT A CHECK BESIDE EACH ITEM THAT IS FAIRLY OFTEN (50 PERCENT OF THE TIME) TRUEABOUT YOU.___ I approach my day as an endless round of things I have to get done.___ I feel exhausted by the end of the day.___ I habitually drink to unwind.___ I am driven to be a success, even though it has personal costs.___ I get poor or erratic sleep. I wake up still feeling tired.___ I go to bed with my mind full of thoughts, often worrisome.___ I smoke.___ I allow my body to get pretty far out of balance before I tend to it.___ I don’t bother about food labels and the ingredients on the package.___ I complain about stress but do little to manage it.___ I am constantly busy and on the run, leaving no time for me to be quiet andcalm.___ My diet is careless.___ I snack, particularly late at night.___ My weight isn’t where it should be.___ I don’t pay attention to whether food is organic or not.___ I prefer red meat over chicken and fish.___ I sit for long periods of time (2 hours or more) without moving, either atwork, on the computer, or watching TV.___ I am considerably less active than I was ten years ago.___ I worry about aging but don’t follow any anti-aging regimen.___ I don’t think much about caring for myself.Score: _____­_____­ (0 to 20)Looking at your two scores, here’s a rough evaluation.Part 1: On the positive side, if you checked around 10 items, you are livinglike the average American. Prevention has made an impression on you, but theresults are hit or miss. A score less than 10 implies that you are runningconsiderable risk for problems down the line. A score over 15 is very goodnews—the super genome is already saying yes to your lifestyle.Part 2: The scoring here is about sending negative messages to your genome morethan half the time. If you score a 10, which is probably close to average forhow Americans live today, you probably enjoy good health but run the risk offuture problems. Even one bad habit has the potential to modify one or moregenes in undesirable ways. A score of less than 10 puts you in good shape formoving forward. A score of 12 or more implies that you should urgently considerhow to improve your well-being.RENÉE’S STORYWe’d love it if everyone got a 20 on the first quiz and a zero on the secondone. But being realistic, there’s always room for improvement. Even though thelifestyle habits we’ve listed are well known in standard prevention, what’s newis the precise and constant attention that the super genome is paying. Nothingescapes its attention. That’s great once you decide to make positive changes,not so great if you remain in the same groove. We can illustrate the situationcreated by the new genetics through one woman’s story.Renée, now in her early fifties, has been steadfast in doing what’s good forher. She eats a diet of whole foods from every group (fruits, vegetables,legumes, grains). She never eats fast or junk food and hasn’t touched alcohol inyears. Every day in summer she swims; when the weather gets cold she takes abrisk walk after dinner. Renée’s marriage is good, and she thoroughly enjoys herwork as an alternative therapist. Why, then, does she weigh over 225 pounds,having struggled with her weight since her early teens?Renée’s denial is one of timing. When food is in front of her, she has noimpulse control and digs in as if she has no weight problem. It’s when the mealis over, in all the hours between meals, that she suffers from the realizationthat her problem is real and not getting better.Hank would seem to be in a much better situation. He’s sixty-five and has nophysical problems other than the extra twenty pounds he associates with middleage. Since he has no aches or pains and rarely gets even a cold, he considershimself fortunate compared with many of his friends with their rash of hip andknee replacements. “I can still eat anything,” says Hank, who claims to have nodigestive problems, which fits in with his claim that he’s never had a headache,backache, or stomachache.His is a subtler form of denial than Renée’s. Hank denies that time will bringfuture problems. Because he feels good today, he ignores almost alldisease-prevention advice. He doesn’t exercise and sits for long hours a day atthe computer, virtually without moving. He eats a wide range of junk and fastfood, with frequent snacking. He has no idea what his blood pressure is, havingstayed away from doctors for decades. Is he going to be the exception to all therisks he’s running?On the spectrum of denial, most people fall somewhere between these twoextremes. Finding the motivation to do what’s good for them is hit or miss. Mostdays they might be careful about what they eat; a couple of hours a week theymay find the time for physical activity; sleep problems, if they exist, aregenerally sporadic. But from our perspective, this situation, which feels normalto millions of people, denies them the possibility of radical well-being. Let’ssee how that can change.LESSONS IN CHOICE MAKINGSee yourself sitting in your favorite restaurant, feeling relaxed and content.You’ve eaten just enough, but the waiter comes around with a familiartemptation: “Leave room for dessert?” You don’t give in immediately but ask tosee the dessert menu. “Coffee, after-dinner drinks?” he asks.“Let’s see,” you say, relenting a little bit more. As you glance over thedessert list, there’s a pause, which could last only a few seconds, and then youpivot into action. Nothing is more important than this pivot. It’s where youcall upon a certain aspect of yourself, the choice-making part. Do you give into temptation or not? Unless you fall into one extreme of total self-disciplineor the other of total lack of impulse control, there’s no predicting what youwill choose.Choice making is difficult, even when it comes to small daily decisions, and soinstead of getting better at it, approaching it as a skill, we behavehaphazardly. Between knowing what’s good for you and doing it there’s a gap. Inthis gap is where the skill of choice making is learned. Eating a rich dessertand having chocolate remorse afterward comes too late.Yet if you could make just one significant change a week, your progress towardradical well-being would be hugely accelerated. After a month you would feelsome real benefits; after a year the transformation would be complete. Reducedto a steady string of easy choices, the problem of noncompliance woulddisappear. You can even allow yourself to be in denial without feeling guilty,just as long as you alter one thing a week, whether it’s in your diet, yourdaily routine, or your physical activity. Just deciding to stand up and movearound every hour, which seems like a trivial choice, sends positive messages tothe super genome, enough to make a difference in gene activity.The goal of one positive change a week won’t be attainable, however, without aworkable strategy. If you try to change by making a resolution, you’ll fail.Millions of people make New Year’s resolutions, which constitute only one changein the coming year, and yet the vast majority, well over 80 percent according topolls, don’t follow through on their resolutions for more than a short time.Making promises to yourself, feeling guilty over your lapses, and feeling lonelyand self-pitying are all counterproductive. Someone addicted to alcohol or drugswakes up every morning with these feelings. Their past is littered with brokenpromises to themselves.In the welter of advice that repeats the same thing over and over—“Make goodchoices”—very little advice is given on how to do so. Let’s consider three basicprinciples we must deal with in making choices.1. There are easy choices and hard choices.Both kinds present themselves every day, but we usually don’t stand back and payattention to which is which. We carry on as usual, driven by habit, oldconditioning, and sheer unconsciousness. The hard choices, then, are those thattry to move the psychological machinery in a different direction. On thesurface, a choice may seem quite small, but big or small isn’t the issue. Theissue is how hard the choice is. To someone with a severe phobia of insects,picking up an ant or a dead cockroach constitutes a hard choice, and at times animpossible one. On the other hand, soldiers in battle routinely risk theirlives, rushing in under heavy fire to rescue a fallen comrade. The objectivefacts about a choice—whether you are risking a little or a lot, whether thechoice is easy for other people or not, whether it will bring pain orpleasure—is secondary and sometimes totally beside the point. What’s primary iswhether the choice feels hard or easy to you.2. Bad choices sometimes feel good.There’s no mystery here. If you want instant gratification, a shot of joy juicecan be had from ice cream at midnight or “eating the whole thing.” Guiltypleasures provide a double boost by offering gratification while briefly makingthe guilt go away. The downside, which isn’t news, is that the feel-good resultstarts being less effective, and after a while the guilt is so great thatnothing really feels good anymore.3. The gratification from good choices is usually delayed.This has become a classic psychological axiom, thanks to a famous test from thesixties and seventies known as the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment. In oneversion, young children were sat down with a piece of marshmallow candy in frontof them. “You can have the marshmallow now,” they were told, “but if you waitten minutes, you will get two marshmallows.” The researcher left the room, andthe children were observed through a two-way mirror. Some children immediatelyate the marshmallow or ate it after a brief struggle with themselves. Otherchildren waited, even when showing signs of struggle, for the delayedgratification.From this simple test, some psychologists believe, you can tell much about whatkind of adults these children will grow up to be. The instant gratifiers willbecome prone to impulsive decisions, regardless of the consequences. They maypossibly take more risks or ignore the risks in a given situation. Their abilityto plan for the future will be diminished. None of this is so surprising if youremember Aesop’s fable about the grasshopper and the ant. The real issue iswhether the bad habits of live-for-the-moment grasshoppers can be changed.Anyone should be able to see how these issues are at work in their own lives. Ifyou look back at the three people’s stories given as examples of denial, ithardly matters that Ruth Ann, Saskia, and Renée are very different asindividuals. The basic principles of choice making apply to all of us. Thequestion is how to use these basic principles of choice making for our ownadvantage. Following are what we believe are the most workable answers.1. THERE ARE EASY CHOICES AND HARD CHOICES.The answer to turning this principle to your advantage is to start yourtransformation with making small, easy good choices. As these good choicesaccumulate day by day, you will be sending new messages to your epigenome andmicrobiome, the two great centers of change in every cell. At the same time,each daily change, however small, is retraining your brain. It starts gettingused to a new normal. In contrast, hard choices make you run into a brick wall,because the brain can’t face a drastic new normal. The inertia of the past issimply too strong.That’s why going cold turkey on cigarette smoking is such an ineffectivestrategy in terms of long-lasting results. Studies have shown that people whosuccessfully quit smoking give up the habit many times. By cutting back alittle, a lot, or completely, they accumulate the experience of success. Thesuccess lasts only a short time in most cases because of the physical side oftobacco addiction. Yet with repetition, the body does adapt.Any significant change involves repetition. Developing new pathways in the brainis like digging a new river channel. Water will keep running down the oldchannel as long as it’s deeper than the new one. By repeating the change youwant to attain, you will be “digging” a shallow channel at first, but repetitiondeepens it. A physical metaphor can go only so far, however. Mental events aresometimes stronger than any physical history inside the brain. People addictedto alcohol and tobacco sometimes kick their habit overnight, once and for all.The percentage of such people may be tiny (and overnight success isn’t our aimin this book), but they remind us that the mind comes first in choice making,the body second.This would be an arguable point to many biologists, who firmly believe thatphysical processes tell the whole story. But there’s no need for argument,thanks to the intimate connection between mind and body. Every message you sendto your body elicits a response, and the response will influence your nextmessage. This circular dialogue, or feedback loop, is crucial. The choice tosend new messages affects the entire feedback system.2. BAD CHOICES SOMETIMES FEEL GOOD.The answer to using this principle to your advantage is to welcome gratificationinstead of judging it negatively. Are you shocked to hear that? To quote aphrase from the famous TV science fiction show Star Trek: The Next Generation,“Resistance is futile.” Impulses and cravings have power over us because theyhit in the moment. The brain opens a fast track to the desirable sensation, andthe power of the rational mind to override the impulse gets postponed. However,studies have shown that a short pause is often enough to remedy this imbalancebetween reason and sensation. If a group of people wait for five minutes beforeacting on a craving, most of them won’t give in. They find reasons not to, andthe reasons suffice because the moment of instant gratification has passed.(There are even food lockboxes that come with a time-delay mechanism. Let’s sayyou crave potato chips. When the craving strikes, you eat one chip and lock therest of the bag into the box. It keeps the potato chips out of reach for a settime, typically between five and ten minutes, after which the lock releases. Theidea sounds clever, but one wonders how many people are capable of eating justone potato chip when the craving arises, or who don’t have other salty snacksready and waiting in the cupboard.)Instead of trying to manipulate your cravings, let go of the struggle. Look forinstant gratification from better sources. The nutritionist’s advice to eat acarrot instead of half a pint of chocolate gelato isn’t realistic, but perhapstwo Oreos will do the trick, or half a cupcake. There are few strategies thatstop cravings and none that bring them to an end permanently, not by directassault. The best approach is to reset your microbiome by instituting easylifestyle changes and then rely on your body to return to a state in which ithas no cravings.There’s also a major emotional component to cravings and the need for instantgratification. Dealing with this component successfully involves expandedawareness. When you discover what you’re really hungry for, the answer will besomething deeper than peanut butter and jelly or pepperoni pizza. As we’lldiscuss later, in the section on emotions, being fulfilled is an internal statethat you can achieve if you know how to do so. Once you reach this state, theallure of external triggers will greatly diminish and then vanish. A craving foranything “out there” is best answered from “in here.”3. THE GRATIFICATION FROM GOOD CHOICES IS USUALLY DELAYED.The answer to working with this principle is that your microbiome can shortenthe delay in gratification that usually follows good choices. The microbiome isconstantly changing, and it responds quickly to diet, exercise, meditation, andstress reduction. As you continue to make small, easy good choices that also letyou feel good right away, the positive effect of these choices begins to build.Very soon, instead of seeking to feel better, you will instead be trying not tolose the good feeling you already have. In contrast, someone addicted to instantgratification through making bad choices receives short jolts of pleasure thatdecrease over time, and only by feeding the craving is there any pleasure atall. Distraction from pain becomes the whole game.By showing you how to work with the three big principles underlying choicemaking, we’ve put you in the position to create your own path to success. Beingcompletely unique, you shouldn’t be expected to follow a set regimen, whetherit’s the newest miracle diet, fat-burning gym routine, or power supplement.These methods all rely on the expectation that you will give up after a whileand move on to the next profitable fad. What works is not restless wanderingfrom one short-term solution to the next. Instead, you need to build a pyramidof easy choices that bring long-term results. The foundation of the pyramid ismade out of the choices you consider the easiest to make. You then build thepyramid upward, level by level, with harder choices that have become easy thanksto the foundation. The capstone is radical well-being, which looks high and faraway when you’re standing on the ground but is almost effortless to achieve ifyou know what you’re building and how to do it.MAKING IT REALLet’s give an example of pyramid building that actually comes from someone quiteclose to one of the authors. We’ll call him Rudy’s older cousin Vincent,although that’s not his real identity. Vincent has been a practicing physiciansince the early eighties and has earned a name for himself in internal medicine.As often happens with doctors, Vincent doesn’t practice what he preaches. Hisdaily routine involves long hours without physical activity and with muchexposure to the stress of hearing his patients’ distressed reaction to illness.He prides himself on handling this very well. Years of dedication and ambitionhave made him what he is today, but Vincent has paid the price.If he had come to himself as a patient, he’d be alarmed. Vincent carries fortypounds of excess weight. He drinks alcohol every day, sometimes to excess. Hecomplains of insomnia and feeling fatigued. Recently the situation couldn’t beignored any longer because he developed joint pain, particularly in his knees.Undergoing surgical replacement only partially relieved his knee pain. You mightthink that the accumulation of these negative effects would have set Vincent,given all his professional knowledge, on the road to change, but that’s not howhuman nature works. Having chosen denial as his chief tactic for dealing withhis problems, Vincent had little choice but to double up on his denial asmatters grew worse.Then he made a discovery that got his full attention: the microbiome. Buoyed bythe data, Vincent had found a way to bypass his denial while at the same timealtering his lifelong view that only drugs and surgery are “real” medicine. Thechanges he made in his daily routine were all easy for him:• Eating foods with soluble fiber like whole-grain bread, brown rice, bananas,oatmeal, and orange juice. This took care of his prebiotics, the food thatintestinal bacteria feed on.• Adding probiotic foods, which contain beneficial bacteria that would colonizein his intestines, primarily the colon. Active yogurt, sauerkraut, and picklesbelong in the probiotic camp.• Taking an aspirin a day for its anti-inflammatory effect.• Cutting back on excess alcohol while not giving up his five-o’clock cocktail.Vincent felt good about these easy changes, and he noticed results immediatelyin better sleep, pain reduction, and a general sense of feeling lighter.He became convinced, as more and more doctors are, that fighting inflammationwas the key. Now that he felt better, he regained his old optimism and hope.Getting rid of his problems seemed possible for the first time in years. Thenext stage of changes was made easy by his new attitude.• He gave up drinking altogether. This wasn’t a hard choice, because he wasfeeling so much better that he didn’t need alcohol—and its inflammatoryeffects—as self-medication. At the same time he gave up the occasional cigar heused to enjoy with colleagues. The toxicity of tobacco became all too obvious tohis palate and nose once they became sensitive again. Giving up smoking happenednaturally as one outcome of his improved diet.• He switched entirely to whole organic foods. There was no longer anyattraction to foods with additives and preservatives, which were also possiblyinflammatory.• He reduced his salt intake, a craving that snack and junk foods heavilyenforce. This was easy because his whole-foods diet had removed the desire tosnack.• After researching the possible benefits of taking a probiotic supplement, hechose one, with the intention of improving the kinds of bacteria that populatehis microbiome.Instead of suffering from a cascade of symptoms, many of them tied toinflammation and toxins leaking through the intestinal wall, Vincent wasexperiencing a cascade of recovery. Each easy step led to others that he wouldhave considered hard choices if they had existed on a laundry list of goodthings to do. Instead, his lifestyle evolved day by day, and each changenaturally led to the next.Presently Vincent finds himself poised to make changes that were practicallyinconceivable even two months ago. Never a believer in the mind-body connection,he’s now willing to take up meditation. The studies on the benefits ofmeditation have been around for decades, but only today does he make a personalconnection with them—he’s started thinking in terms of epigenetics and themicrobiome, which are both affected positively by meditation.After years of dependency on painkillers and drug treatment for his high bloodpressure, Vincent has decided to wean himself off both. The first to go were themeds for hypertension, because a whole-foods diet reset his microbiome, and thiswas enough to regularize his blood pressure. The theme of counteringinflammation, which was his original inspiration, has obviously paid off and maybe leading to long-term benefits that aren’t yet visible.Your personal story—and your path to well-being—won’t be the same as Vincent’s.It shouldn’t be. There is no one-size-fits-all, not when it comes to makingchoices that you can actually abide by. What will make your path similar toVincent’s is tending to the three issues in choice making. He applied the sameanswers being offered to you.To overcome the problem of hard choices, Vincent made only easy ones every stepof the way. Some of these would have seemed too hard at the outset, but theyweren’t once he had laid the proper foundation.To overcome the problem of instant gratification, he stopped resisting hisimpulses, which went a long way to ending his guilt and self-judgment. He gavealternative gratification a chance through foods he enjoyed, and he trusted thatalcohol and tobacco would fall away naturally, which they did after his chronicpain subsided.To overcome the problem of delayed results, he made choices in which the resultscame quickly, primarily by changing to a whole-foods diet. Staying on theprogram didn’t require patience and promises. You have to be patient if yourchoices don’t alter the situation in your body until years afterward, as is truefor anyone taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, for example—the heart attack theyare trying to prevent lies years in the future (not to mention that such drugsmay lower heart attack rates for a large enough sample of people but aren’tguaranteed to prevent any specific heart attack, meaning yours).You’ve probably noticed some areas that Vincent didn’t bring into his newchoices. The most obvious is exercise. He cherishes weekend golf games, whichfor now satisfy what he wants from exercise. But he also knows that golf isn’t acardiovascular activity, the kind of exercise that raises your heart rate andimproves oxygen consumption, with the attendant benefits to cardiovascularfunction and blood pressure. Excess weight and joint pain had prevented him fromdoing this kind of exercise for a long time, so for Vincent, cardiovascularexercise still falls into the category of hard choices—a category that’s alwaysup for revision if you approach it with the attitude of building a pyramid oneeasy choice at a time.Now you’re prepared to construct your own pyramid, with each stone being one newchoice per week that is easy to make. There are six categories of change thatwill have a meaningful effect on your epigenome, microbiome, and brain:DietStressExerciseMeditationSleepEmotionsFor each of these we’ll offer you a menu of choices. Each menu will be longenough to present choices that are easy for anyone to adopt. Once you havecircled your preferences in all six categories, you’ll be ready to implementthem with zero effort and every expectation of positive results. Pyramidbuilding is the key to successful change that is lasting and cumulative.Making changes one at a time selected from six different areas of your lifeincreases their effect on the entire mind-body system. We recommend keepingtrack of the effects of your lifestyle changes by using the following list:RESULTS TO LOOK FORPUT A CHECK BESIDE EACH RESULT THAT YOU BEGIN TO NOTICE AFTER ADOPTING A NEWLIFESTYLE CHANGE.___ Digestion improves.___ Upset stomach and/or heartburn decreases.___ Constipation or diarrhea is no longer a problem.___ Your body feels lighter.___ You feel a growing sense of inner peace and calm.___ Your thinking is sharper, more alert.___ You are losing weight without dieting.___ Signs of aging slow down.___ Signs of aging actually reverse—you feel younger.___ Life seems less stressful, and you can handle stress better.___ Moods even out, no longer going up and down.___ You have a sense of pleasant well-being.___ Minor aches and pains lessen or vanish.___ Hunger pangs lessen or vanish.___ A natural cycle of hunger and satiation returns.___ Headaches decrease or go away.___ Bad breath lessens or vanishes.___ Sleep becomes regular and uninterrupted.___ Allergies improve.___ Snacking is no longer a temptation.___ Excessive sugar is no longer a temptation.___ Cravings for addictive flavors (sweet, sour, salty) lessen.___ Alcohol consumption decreases.___ Tobacco consumption decreases.FOR YOUR DOCTOR TO VERIFY:___ Lower blood pressure___ Normal blood sugar levels___ Normal heart rate___ Improvement in anxiety or depression, if present___ Increase in HDLs (high-density lipoproteins, or good cholesterol)___ Reduction in LDLs (low-density lipoproteins, or bad cholesterol)___ Improved triglycerides (lowered risk of heart disease and stroke)___ Normal kidney function___ Better dental checkups (reduced plaques, cavities, gum inflammation)"},{"pageContent":"DIETGETTING RID OF INFLAMMATIONIt won’t come as a surprise by now that the biggest enemy in people’s diet isinflammation. Medical researchers have tracked its footprints all over the map,from chronic disease and obesity to leaky gut syndrome and mental illness. Thetypical American diet is very likely to increase inflammation, and therefore achange is called for. The change will be drastic for anyone who subsists on junkand fast food. Yet the overload of sugar that enters into almost any diet if youaren’t vigilant is also a prime suspect. Evolution didn’t prepare us to consumeover one hundred pounds of refined white sugar a year; it’s not clear we evolvedto consume it at all, along with the cheaper corn syrup that manufactured foodsincreasingly contain.Inflammation is necessary to the healing process, when the immune system rusheschemicals known as free radicals to flood the wounded or diseased area. Almostall the symptoms of flu, such as fever and aches and pains, are not from the fluvirus but from your body’s recovery efforts and the inflammation that comesalong with it. In this way, inflammation is our friend. Yet our friend can turnon us without our being aware.You can be in a state of chronic inflammation without knowing it, because unlikethe red, swollen areas that appear on your skin when it’s inflamed, the internalsigns of inflammation often go unnoticed. There is typically no feeling attachedwhen the immune system is mildly compromised, and some signs of inflammation,such as joint pain, could have other causes. Our approach is to make easychoices that have an anti-inflammatory effect. An anti-inflammatory diet willcause most people to notice benefits right away.Reading the menu: The menu of choices is divided into three parts, according tolevel of difficulty and proven effectiveness.PART 1: EASY CHOICESFirst are the choices that anyone can implement. If you begin to adopt them, youwill be laying the foundation of your pyramid. As tempting as it is to adoptmore than one easy choice at a time, resist the urge. Over the course of a year,you will be making fifty-two weekly changes in your lifestyle. There’s no needto pile up on yourself.PART 2: HARDER CHOICESThese are choices that you feel resistance about adopting, or which you know aretoo difficult to maintain without backsliding. That’s perfectly okay. Harderchoices can wait until you feel you have made all the easy choices you can. Forsome people the harder choices will actually be easy, because everyone has adifferent starting point. For most people, however, the harder choices are forhigher up on the pyramid. They need to feel easy before you tackle them;otherwise you risk making a change that you can’t continue.PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL CHOICESThese are steps that have strong advocacy and intriguing research behind them,but which definitely constitute a minority position for now. Dietary fads comeand go. Today’s research gets modified or overturned tomorrow. Before adoptingan experimental choice, read our caveats, pursue your own investigations, andmake an informed choice. In any case, none of these experimental choices shouldsubstitute for the choices in Parts 1 and 2.Remember that whatever choices you make are meant to be permanent. Since you aremaking only one change a week, you have seven days to see how it works out. Ifeverything goes smoothly, you’re ready to select a second change in thefollowing week. Don’t rush; don’t put pressure on yourself. The secret to thisstrategy is making sure that it progresses effortlessly.We think it’s prudent to make dietary changes first, because food has the mostdirect effect on the microbiome. Our advice is to spend the first month entirelyon dietary changes, but it’s up to you. Before making any change, be sure thatyou’ve read all six sections of the program.DIET: THE MENU OF CHOICESCIRCLE TWO TO FIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE EASY TO MAKE IN YOUR CURRENT DIET. THEHARDER CHOICES SHOULD FOLLOW AFTER YOU HAVE ADOPTED YOUR EASY CHOICES, ONE PERWEEK.PART 1: EASY CHOICES• Add prebiotics with soluble fiber to your breakfast (e.g., oatmeal, pulpyorange juice, bran cereal, bananas, a fruit smoothie made from unpeeled fruits).• Eat a side salad with lunch or dinner (preferably both).• Add anti-inflammatory foods to your diet (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page127]).• Consume probiotic foods once a day (e.g., active yogurt, kefir, pickles,sauerkraut, kimchi).• Switch to whole-grain bread and cereals.• Eat fatty fish at least twice a week (e.g., fresh salmon, mackerel, tuna, andcanned or fresh sardines).• Reduce alcohol to one beer or glass of wine a day, taken with a meal.• Take a daily probiotic supplement and a multivitamin pill. Also take half anadult aspirin or one baby aspirin—see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page125].• Reduce snacking by eating only one measured portion in a bowl—don’t eat fromthe bag.• Share dessert in a restaurant.PART 2: HARDER CHOICES• Switch to organic foods, including chicken and meat from animals not raised onhormones.• Limit or eliminate red meat from your diet; at least switch to organicalternatives, including chicken and meat from animals not raised on hormones.• Switch to “pastured” eggs high in omega-3 fatty acids (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page143]).• Become a vegetarian.• Cut out refined white sugar.• Drastically reduce packaged foods.• Eliminate alcohol.• Stop eating fast foods.• Stop buying processed foods.• Stop eating when you’re not hungry.PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL CHOICES• Adopt a gluten-free diet.• Become a vegan.• Eliminate wheat entirely.• Have only fruit and/or cheese instead of dessert.• Adopt a Mediterranean diet (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page129]).EXPLAINING THE CHOICESWe won’t need to explain every choice on the list individually, because there’sa shared goal behind everything: fighting inflammation. In the easy category,your goal is to find effortless ways to combat inflammation. Chief among theseis resetting your microbiome, where the digestive process starts the pathwaythat leads to inflammation. As we saw earlier, toxins produced by your gutmicrobes are safe as long as they remain in the digestive tract. But “leaky gutsyndrome,” which seems to be much more prevalent than previously expected, sendstoxins into the bloodstream, and from there, the body fights the toxins usinginflammation—a healthy response, but a dangerous one. Resetting your microbiomeis the best defense and the first step to keeping these toxins where theynaturally belong.Modern life exposes us to many influences that either harm the microbiome or aresuspected to harm it, including the widespread use of antibiotics, a high-fat,high-sugar diet, lack of fiber, air pollution, excessive stress, bad sleep, andvarious additives and hormones in the food we buy. The microbes that colonizethe gut are a direct cause of inflammation but also a protection against it whenthe microbiome is healthy.You aren’t aiming for a “perfect” microbiome, because no one can define such athing, not yet at least. With over one thousand species of bacteria to consider,and with the microbiome being in a constant state of flux, perfection may beunattainable, or even the wrong thing to pursue. It’s easier and more sensibleto change your diet away from inflammation. There’s no harm in doing so, anddoing so offers the promise of many benefits.Prebiotics come first. These are foods for the microbiome, chiefly from fiberthat our own bodies can’t digest. Evolution has led to a happy partnership inwhich bacteria consume the fuel they need without robbing our bodies of any, andvice versa. Prebiotic foods also buffer the body from inflammation by reducingendotoxin, a poison created by certain bacteria that is harmless inside the GItract but highly inflammatory if it leaks into the bloodstream and activates theimmune system. (See this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#page88]regarding the research that shows how a glass of freshly squeezed orange juicecompletely offsets the inflammatory effect of a high-fat McDonald’s breakfast.)Prebiotic foods aren’t scarce. We recommend a breakfast that’s rich in them,from bananas and pulpy orange juice to oatmeal, whole-grain breakfast cereal,and fruit smoothies made with unpeeled apple, various berries, and other fruits.You’ll find countless recipes online, and the smoothie can be made withvegetables instead of fruit if that’s what you prefer. Just be aware that greenvegetables, the main ingredient in veggie smoothies, are much lower in caloriesthan fruit. You don’t want to eat a breakfast that’s lower than 350 to 500calories if you want enough energy to get to lunch without hunger pains and withsufficient energy. A salad with lunch or dinner also serves as a good prebioticbuffer.Probiotics are foods that contain active bacteria. Active yogurt is the mostcommon one at the supermarket, but there’s also pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi (atraditional Korean fermented cabbage dish), and kefir (a fermented milk drinkthat tastes similar to yogurt). Including one of these foods during a meal helpsto reset your microbiome by introducing beneficial bacteria that will colonizethe walls of the intestine and hopefully reduce or drive out harmful bacteria.Because of the complexity of the microbiome and the huge differences from oneperson to another, there is no completely reliable prediction on the effects ofprobiotic foods. The best thing is to try them—all are completely harmless—andthen look for results.Probiotic supplements are a booming business that’s expected to risedramatically in the future. Health food stores offer a bewildering variety ofthese supplements, some in pill form to be taken on a full stomach, others inperishable form that must be refrigerated. There is no expert medical adviceabout the best probiotic supplements, for the same reason that crops uprepeatedly: the microbiome is too complex and is constantly shifting. It shouldalso be noted that a reliable supplement that contains 1 billion bacteria willenter a gut ecology of 100 trillion microbes. Outnumbered 100,000 to 1, thesupplement may have negligible impact.We prefer to be optimistic. Any opportunity to reset the microbiome to a stateof natural balance is worth taking. A supplement can’t substitute in anysignificant way for getting your probiotics through food, yet it’s an easychoice to take a supplement. Also, to augment the benefit, add a multivitaminand one baby aspirin, or half an adult aspirin, to your routine. The aspirin isa proven way to reduce the risk of heart attack and some kinds of cancer. (Besure to consult your doctor before combining aspirin with other drugs,particularly those that have anti-inflammatory or blood-thinning properties.)The multivitamin isn’t a must if you are eating a balanced diet, but as we age,the intestinal tract becomes less efficient at processing vitamins and minerals.Studies have shown that up to one-third of dementia cases are linked to mineraldeficiencies or poor diet.Dementia is a generic term that covers a host of disease conditions, includingAlzheimer’s disease, which Rudy studies, and there’s no accepted dietary regimenthat is guaranteed to be preventive. But research that focuses on how foodaffects brain cells has come up with a few general guidelines that are easy tofollow; most are directly in line with an anti-inflammation diet. Thepreventives areOmega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish (For those who are alarmed by heavymetals present in fish oil, an alternative source is organic flaxseed oil alongwith a handful of walnuts every day. If you do choose fish oil, usetriple-distilled oil to avoid heavy-metal contaminants.)Antioxidant micronutrients (blueberries, dark chocolate, green tea) to fightfree-radical damage in the brainB vitamins (not more than the recommended daily allowance)A Mediterranean diet (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page129])Keep in mind that these are provisional suggestions. Even a supplement likevitamin E, which has been promoted for decades for its antioxidant effects, hasrun into contrary research. The basic neuroscience revolves around the fact thatbrain tissue is quite vulnerable to free-radical damage, because the brain uses20 percent of the total oxygen consumed by the body. Free radicals are moleculeswith an extra oxygen atom that is quick to find another molecule to bind with.Although necessary for healing wounds as part of the whole inflammatoryresponse, free radicals in excess can damage healthy cells through unwantedchemical reactions; brain cells seem to be a prime target in cases of dementia.Reducing potential damage from overly active oxygenation is the common linkconnecting most of the preventives listed above, but totally validated proof islacking. Our position is that a balanced diet is the best way to protectyourself, but taking a supplement may be helpful, particularly if you are overage sixty-five. A common effect of aging is reduced kidney function, which oftenresults from low-level inflammation of the kidneys, or nephritis. Decreasedkidney function diminishes the body’s retention of the water-soluble vitamins Band C. Taking a multivitamin supplement, then, makes sense if you are older. Themain drawback for most people is that vitamins don’t usually have anydiscernible benefit that you can feel, and the damage that can be traced toinflammation, including excess free radicals, should be addressed directlythrough an anti-inflammatory dietary regimen.Anti-inflammatory foods have come into favor with increasing public interest andresearch studies. If you are primarily interested in seeing a list of specificanti-inflammatory foods, you can find a generally agreed-upon list atwww.health.com [http://www.health.com]. But it is much more effective tounderstand the whole issue of inflammation, because a holistic approach attacksthe problem from many angles instead of just one. The following foods are listedprimarily to reinforce your knowledge, not to tell you that only these “right”foods belong in your diet.FOODS THAT FIGHT INFLAMMATIONFatty fish (but see the caveat about heavy metals on this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page125])BerriesTree nutsSeedsWhole grainsDark leafy greensSoy (including soy milk and tofu)TempehMycoprotein (from mushrooms and other fungi)Low-fat dairy productsPeppers (e.g., bell peppers, various chilies—the hot taste isn’t an indicationof inflammatory effects in the body)TomatoesBeetsTart cherriesGinger and turmericGarlicOlive oilIn their online health publications, Harvard Medical School adds a few items tothe list:Cocoa and dark chocolateBasil and many other herbsBlack pepperAlcohol in moderation (but also see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page133])Other listings add the following:Cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, bok choy, broccoli, cauliflower)AvocadoHot sauceCurry powderCarrotsOrganic turkey breast (substitute for red meats)TurnipsZucchiniCucumberNeedless to say, these are all healthy whole foods, and making them a mainstayof our diet can only be beneficial. However, the science is still out on whetherall of these foods have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body, and also whateffect, if any, they have on the genome, epigenome, and microbiome. Still, thefact that your super genome responds to every experience strongly suggests thatwhat you eat has consequences at the genetic level. The fact that so manydiseases are connected to bad diet proves that there’s a genetic connection, soour best advice is that a good diet is one way to promote better geneticactivity.On the opposite side, there are also foods that increase inflammation, as listedby the same bulletin from Harvard Medical School.FOODS TO LIMIT OR AVOIDRed meatSaturated and trans fats (e.g., animal fats and the hydrogenated vegetable fatsfound in many processed foods)White breadWhite riceFrench friesSugary sodasTo these, other reliable sources addWhite sugar and corn syrup (frequently hidden in processed foods that aren’tprimarily sweet)Omega-6 fatty acids (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page140])Monosodium glutamate (MSG)Gluten (see this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page134])Our feeling is that an anti-inflammatory diet has to be better than aninflammatory one, because the foods that are proven risks—junk food, fast food,fatty and sugary foods—also lead to inflammation. The link between inflammationand chronic disease is too strong to ignore, and paying attention has manybenefits.The Mediterranean diet has a good reputation for being healthy. A 2014 studyconducted in Spain made headlines by proving with statistical accuracy thatsubjects who ate a Mediterranean diet lowered their risk of heart attackconsiderably. In fact, the results were so positive that the study was cutshort, since it became unethical to allow the other subjects to continue ontheir non-Mediterranean diet. There have been no similar studies of ananti-inflammation diet (in fact, the Spanish study was the first of its kind tobe conducted with such scientific rigor), but the overlap is significant. AMediterranean diet replaces red meat with fish, and butter with olive oil.Alternatively, for vegetarians like Rudy, noninflammatory protein can beobtained from other sources like tempeh, tofu, and mycoprotein (e.g., Quorn andGardein products). Whole fruits, vegetables, low-fat tree nuts (e.g., almondsand walnuts), and seeds (e.g., chia, hemp, sunflower, pumpkin, flax) are alsorecommended. When you add all of these up, you’ll see that some of the mostimportant anti-inflammation foods are there in the Mediterranean diet.Why, then, do we place the Mediterranean diet under experimental choices? Thereare several reasons. First is the permanence of such a change. Sticking with thediet comes easily if you are a native of the region and have been on it sincechildhood, but the Mediterranean diet is not so easy as a lifetime choice if youare used to the typical Western diet. Also, unless you live alone, there’s theissue of asking your family to make the change with you. But just as importantis the science. The kind of study that was conducted in Spain is about risks asthey pertain to large groups. It’s a numbers game. Going on the Mediterraneandiet doesn’t guarantee that any individual is protected, while our aim here, tofight inflammation, is completely about the individual. Still, the Mediterraneandiet comes close to being an anti-inflammation diet, so it’s very worthwhile totry, but only after you’ve made other, easier choices to see if you’veaccomplished the same goal.Switching to olive oil brings up the tangled issue of fats in the diet. Ourprimary advice is to avoid trans fats, chiefly hydrogenated oils found inpackaged foods and at some, but not all, fast-food chains. These oils are knownto have inflammatory effects. Limiting saturated fats in butter and cream andavoiding red meat also seem prudent.You need to have a healthy balance of blood lipids (fats), including cholesteroland triglycerides. Both are necessary for cell building and repair. Blood lipidsare processed by your liver after you ingest fat in your diet. This processingis quite complex, depending on diet, genes, weight, age, illness, and otherfactors. Problems can arise for anyone who is obese, whose liver is geneticallypredisposed to deliver too much cholesterol to the body, who suffers from ahormonal imbalance, or whose immune system has been activated by inflammation,among other factors. It’s not as simple as “ingest more cholesterol, and yourcholesterol levels will go up.” To further cloud the issue, the leading drugsfor lowering cholesterol, known as statins, do not seem to reduce the risk ofheart attacks, according to studies going back to 2010. This indicates what haslong been known, that heart attacks depend on more than just cholesterol.We feel that inflammation, which is strongly linked to heart disease, is thefirst culprit to go after. The damage it causes can be traced back to thegut-inflammation connection. With so many risk factors tied to inflammation, itseems better and easier to work on it as a whole rather than singling out “good”and “bad” fats. We aren’t endorsing saturated fats by any means. Polyunsaturatedcooking oil, and especially olive oil, remains the healthiest choice.Another issue is how much fat you should be eating. People find it quitedifficult to cut back their fat consumption all at once, even though extreme fatrestriction has long been part of the heart health program devised by Dr. DeanOrnish at the University of California, San Francisco. Ornish’s lifestyle-drivenapproach to heart disease led to extraordinary results. His program of diet,exercise, meditation, and stress reduction remains the only proven way toreverse the plaque that lines the coronary arteries in people at high risk forheart attacks. Ornish also pioneered in studies showing that his program createsbeneficial changes in the genome through epigenetic switching of hundreds, nowthousands, of genes, a process known as upregulation.To clear coronary arteries of plaque, as Ornish has accomplished, requires asevere cutback in fat intake, to as little as one tablespoon of added fat a day.The standard recommendation from the American Heart Association allows for fatto be 30 percent of one’s daily calorie intake—a huge difference. (Even reaching30 percent is difficult, considering that the average American diet, althougharound 34 percent fat, which doesn’t seem far off the mark, has actually addedan extra 340 calories a day over the past two decades. This amounts to apotential weight gain of over 30 pounds a year.)We support and acknowledge Dr. Ornish for his invaluable work, but severe fatrestriction leads to noncompliance. Cutting back to only a few tablespoons ofall fats and oils a day, or as little as one tablespoon if you are beingrigorous, simply taxes the average person too much. Low-fat diets for weightloss probably fail around 98 percent of the time, insofar as that’s the failurerate for all crash diets. Our approach of building a pyramid of easy choicesdoesn’t include severe fat restriction.Besides noncompliance, we have another good reason, we believe, for not puttinga strong emphasis on fats or on cutting back on calories as the road to weightloss. Animal studies strongly suggest that the microbiome may be the real key.As we alluded to earlier, simply by inserting microbes from obese mice intoother mice with the same genome leads to weight gain in the normal mice.Anecdotal evidence from self-experimenters like Dr. Zhao in China leads to thesame conclusion, as does the small study with identical twins in which one twinis obese and the other twin lean.Resetting the microbiome through an anti-inflammation diet is win-win. It willeither lead directly to weight loss or put you in a state of balance in whichmoderate calorie cutting becomes feasible without backsliding. We’ve summarizedour weight-loss strategy in the following list.BASIC STEPS FOR WEIGHT LOSS• Don’t follow a calorie-restricted diet. Leave calorie cutting for the end, notthe beginning, of your weight-loss regimen.• Focus on the easy steps for reducing inflammation first.• Put your attention on prebiotic and probiotic foods.• At the same time, make easy choices about increasing your physical activity.The most important step is to stop being sedentary and to move throughout theday.• Attend to good sleep, since bad sleep throws off the key hormones for hungerand satiation.• Make easy choices relating to emotions, since emotional eating is generally acomponent of weight gain.• After following the above steps for at least 3 to 4 months, assess if you arelosing weight. A loss of ½ pound per week would be considered a high benchmark.A loss of 2 pounds a month is still a success. If you’ve lost that much, keepdoing what you’re doing without cutting calories.• If you see no weight loss, consider cutting 200 calories from your dailyintake as long as that’s easy for you. Consider this a permanent choice like theother easy choices on the program.• If it’s not easy to cut calories, keep making other changes and check back onyour weight in 2 months. Reassess calorie cutting then.Alcohol has had its medical proponents for a long time, and the public tends toaccept that the French have lower heart attack rates because of the nationalhabit of wine drinking. In the list of anti-inflammatory foods, the HarvardMedical School online site includes a drink a day (although not defined, thispresumably means one beer or one glass of wine) because of a single beneficialeffect: it seems to lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a powerful signalof inflammation. More than one drink (the source of the alcohol doesn’t appearto matter) increases CRP, however. In general, alcohol has been classed asinflammatory. It is metabolized very quickly, like refined white sugar, and weconsider it in the same class as white sugar when it comes to potential damagethroughout the system.But we are also realists and realize that social drinking is deeply embedded inthe West and is increasingly catching on in Asia. People don’t like giving upsomething they enjoy. Therefore we offer an easy choice to limit yourself to onedrink a day, preferably as part of a complete meal so that the metabolic rush ofthe alcohol is tempered by other food. Our hope is that by adopting easy changesthat reset your microbiome and send positive messages to your epigenome andbrain, you will no longer want to drink. You’ll feel good enough without it, andyour sense of well-being will actually be lessened by not having any alcohol atall.Reducing gluten in your diet also falls under the experimental heading. Thenumber of people considered by mainstream medicine to suffer from a glutenallergy is tiny (the most common diagnosis is among those with celiac disease,which severely damages the intestines), but there’s a widespread belief,amounting to a crusade, that countless others are feeling the ill effects ofgluten. As anyone soon discovers when trying to eliminate gluten from theirdiet, it appears in many processed foods, not just in the usual source thatcomes to mind, which is wheat and wheat products.Symptoms of gluten sensitivity, often generalized as “wheat belly,” includebloating, diarrhea or constipation, distended abdomen, and abdominal pain. Thislist, which centers on digestion, has been extended by some advocates to othersymptoms elsewhere in the body, such as headache, generalized pain, and fatigue.Self-diagnosis is the most common route, because doctors look for specificallergic responses recognized as celiac disease or the most typical alternative,nonceliac gluten sensitivity. Medical training also pinpoints various disorders,like irritable bowel syndrome, that have much the same range of symptoms; orwheat allergy, which is sometimes present without sensitivity to other sourcesof gluten.Since we are asking you to make easy choices first and foremost, going on atotally gluten-free diet isn’t one of them. The list of foods you would have togive up is long (provided by www.healthline.com [http://www.healthline.com]):Bread, pasta, and baked goods made from wheat (or wheat bran, wheat germ, orwheat starch)CouscousCracked wheatDurumFarinaFarroFu (common in Asian foods)GliadinGraham flourKamutMatzoSemolinaWheat isn’t the only grain that contains gluten, so you’d also need to cut outBarleyBulgurOats (oats themselves don’t contain gluten but are often processed in plantsthat produce gluten-containing grains and therefore may be contaminated)RyeSeitanTriticale and mir (hybrids of wheat and rye)Veggie burgers (if not specified gluten free)Gluten may also show up as ingredients in barley malt, chicken broth, maltvinegar, some salad dressings, and soy sauce, as well as in many commonseasonings and spice mixes. A gluten-free diet requires total dedication. Forthe sake of completeness, we’ll list the grains that are permitted on such adiet.AmaranthArrowrootBuckwheatCassavaMilletQuinoaRiceSorghumSoyTapiocaOf course you also have the choice of limiting gluten-containing foods ratherthan eliminating them entirely. Both of us have been intrigued enough to tryeliminating gluten in our own diets, and we are very enthusiastic about theresults in increased energy, balanced appetite, and some weight loss. It shouldbe realized, however, that the scientific validation remains to be seen for“wheat belly” as a widespread ill and for wheat sensitivity as a problemaffecting millions of people.If you are still intrigued, go ahead and try an experiment for a week. A simplediet of rice instead of wheat is the foundation for billions of Asians. Youwould also cut out pasta and the vast majority of baked goods. But this isn’tonerous now that gluten-free sweets are on the market, and you don’t need toresort to them if you have nonprocessed sweets like flan or bake withgluten-free flour. The results of our experiment are likely to be quite good,since an Asian diet minus pasta, bread, cake, pie, and cookies is already quitehealthy, leaving aside the controversial issue of gluten sensitivity.Vegetarian diets have long been considered a healthy alternative. We have made apersonal choice to move toward a plant-based diet. Rudy has been vegetariansince his university days, but when faced with a busy schedule, he does consumesome dairy for the purpose of quick protein. In India, the Brahmin, or priest,caste traditionally subsists on a meat-free diet, and for many people excludingmeat is a humanitarian measure connected with the killing of animals. For mostpeople, however, vegetarianism represents a hard choice. Being naturally high infiber, a vegetarian diet is very likely to be anti-inflammatory and beneficialto the microbiome as well. Why, then, aren’t lifelong vegetarians free ofchronic disease? Actually, many are. The current data show that vegetarians areat lower risk forHeart diseaseColorectal, ovarian, and breast cancerDiabetesObesityHypertensionThese findings don’t sort out the anti-inflammation factor, so there’s no way ofknowing the status of vegetarians who also avoid refined sugar, alcohol, highstress, and a sedentary lifestyle. Until there’s a study on people who haveadopted a holistic lifestyle aimed at reducing inflammation, being a vegetarianstands as a very good choice if it’s easy for you, but it’s by no means apanacea.On a comparative scale, it’s much easier to follow a vegetarian diet than avegan diet. Like a vegetarian diet, a vegan diet is plant based and excludesmeat, but it also typically excludes all dairy products (milk, cream, yogurt,butter, cheese), along with eggs and all products that contain theseingredients. A strict vegan diet therefore involves a meticulous regimen forgetting adequate protein. Soy (in tofu or tempeh) is a complete protein and assuch is generally a major source of protein for many vegans, and also forvegetarians.Your body needs nine amino acids, the building blocks of protein, that it cannotproduce itself. It’s not necessary to have all of them at every meal, and forvegetarians, a diverse mixture of vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts will besufficient. However, there are some foods for vegetarians in addition to soythat contain all nine of these essential amino acids, including quinoa,buckwheat, hemp seed, chia, and the simple food combination of rice and beans.Rudy limits his soy intake to one meal a week so as not to overload onphytoestrogens—naturally occurring compounds in soy that are similar to humanestrogen. Although current research tends to show that males don’t suffer a riskof lower testosterone from phytoestrogens, Rudy has made this personal choice interms of his intake of hormones.Besides these protein sources, to make sure you’re getting adequate protein as avegan you would use combinations of foods that contain various amino acids, thebuilding blocks of protein, to get a full complement—that is, a completeprotein. (The usual route is to combine legumes, grains, potatoes, and evenmycoprotein, e.g., in Quorn products, in different combinations.) We have putvegetarianism under harder choices and vegan diet under experimental choices forthe above reasons. Having been a vegetarian since college, Rudy, along with hisentire family, fully enjoys this lifestyle choice.THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE CHANGESBoth the epigenome and the microbiome play crucial parts in how food affectsyour body at a much deeper level than was ever suspected. When nutritionistVictor Lindlahr titled his 1942 book You Are What You Eat, he did more than coina popular phrase; he foresaw by decades the research that would support thediet-gene connection. Now numerous studies exist, primarily with mice, showingthat diet is in fact the main factor influencing the composition of themicrobial genome we harbor in our gut. For example, switching suddenly from avegan to an animal-based diet changes the microbiome in just days. In a study atthe University of California, San Francisco, mice were fed either ahigh-animal-fat, high-sugar (junk food) diet or a low-fat, plant-based (vegan)diet. When the animals were then switched from the vegan to the junk food diet,the host of intestinal microbes (as assessed in their feces) changed withinthree days regardless of the genetics of the mice used. Diet mattered much morethan genes. This finding helps to explain why identical twins with identicalgenomes can have as many differences in their microbiome as two siblings whoaren’t twins and therefore have similar but not identical genomes.Diet also dramatically affects epigenetics, as we saw earlier in the example ofthe Dutch famine during World War II. In rural Gambia, for example, there is arainy (hungry) season, when nutrition is low in protein and energy, and a dry(harvest) season, when the diet is heavy in vegetables and high-energy foods.Children of 84 mothers conceived during the hungry season had lower birthweights and higher levels of epigenetic modifications (methylation) in theirgenome than those conceived by 83 mothers during the harvest season. (There werealso major differences in B vitamin and folic acid levels in maternal bloodsamples in the two seasons, which correlated with the epigenetic changes.)The children born to mothers who experienced an unhealthy diet during conceptionwere also more likely to go on to develop insulin resistance and type 2diabetes. Naturally, these facts underscore the need for all pregnant women tomaintain a healthy diet, but the larger point was expressed nearly two centuriesago when the noted French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin wrote:“Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es”—“Tell me what you eat, andI will tell you what you are.”MAKING THE SCIENCE WORKWhen people look for information about diets, three forces pull at them. Allthree are supposedly based on science, yet they contradict one another.First is the standard nutritional advice to eat a balanced diet. This advicechanges slowly. It is well established in nutritional studies. The problem isthat people don’t comply. In the face of solid science, the American dietcontinues to move in the wrong direction (i.e., high fat, high sugar, anoverload of calories, reliance on junk and fast foods).Second is cutting-edge research studies. These studies can be very intriguing,and the studies on inflammation and the diet represent a major breakthrough. Theproblem is lack of human trials on a wide basis, along with findings thatcontradict each other.Third is the latest fad diet for weight loss. These diets typically makeoverstated claims and seem to change every day, using “breakthrough” researchthat may be flimsy or badly skewed. Sometimes no real science exists in supportof the latest diet. Yet the public rushes to follow the latest fad until a newone is touted on the grapevine.We’ve taken a stand on some cutting-edge research despite the absence oflarge-scale human trials. Countering inflammation, as with the Mediterraneandiet, seems scientifically sound to us. In any event, an anti-inflammation dietoverlaps with standard nutrition in almost every area and thus provides a secondsource of scientific validation. However, there are areas of confusion in ananti-inflammation diet that should be faced honestly.Fatty acids are a prime example of such an area of confusion. There has beenrising awareness that the omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish are good foryou, and standard nutrition advises everyone to eat such fish once or twice aweek. Yet there’s another group of fatty acids, omega-6s, that complicate thestory. Your body needs both omega-3s and omega-6s, and because it can’t makethem, they must come through diet. What makes these substances special is thatunlike other fats, the omega group isn’t used primarily for energy, but forbiological processes, including the production of red blood cells.It seems to be crucial, according to various studies, to keep omega-6 levelsdown, because high levels are strongly linked to inflammation. Improvements inheart disease and rheumatoid arthritis have been shown by getting the balancebetween omega-3s and omega-6s back into the healthy range. All Western diets aretoo high in omega-6s because of the heavy use of polyunsaturated cooking oils.Yet these oils, made from vegetable sources—corn, soy, safflower, and so on—wereonce considered the healthiest ones, with risk factors for heart attack as theprimary support for this claim.Today the evidence has strongly moved in another direction. Studies ofindigenous peoples (who use few processed vegetable oils and eat no processedpackaged foods) indicate that the ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s in their diet isabout 4:1. In contrast, Western diets are fifteen to forty times too high inomega-6 foods, with an average ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s of 16:1. At suchhigh levels, the omega-6 fatty acids block the benefits of the omega-3s. Geneticstudies aren’t easy to come by in this area, but it’s speculated that we evolvedin hunter-gatherer societies to consume a diet even lower in omega-6s, with aratio of omega-6s to omega-3s closer to 2:1. In the body, getting closer to a1:1 ratio seems ideal, according to some experts.Among foods high in omega-6s, cooking oil leads the way, but there are others,as follows:MAIN SOURCES OF OMEGA-6 FATTY ACIDSProcessed vegetable oils—highest are sunflower, corn, soy, and cottonseedProcessed foods using soy oilGrain-fed beef“Factory-raised” chicken and porkNon-free-range eggsFatty cuts of conventionally raised meatsAs you can see, the polyunsaturated oils that are a major part of standarddisease prevention turn out to have a serious drawback in terms of inflammation.The only vegetable oil that is low in omega-6s and high in omega-3s is flaxseedoil. Safflower, canola, and olive oil aren’t particularly high in omega-3s butare the lowest in omega-6s among commonly sold vegetable oils, with olive oilthe best.Adding to the confusion, “bad” saturated fats like lard, butter, palm oil, andcoconut oil are low in omega-6s. This is one reason why standard nutritionaladvice has begun to recommend a balance of saturated and polyunsaturated fats.But the real culprit, it seems, isn’t so much the food we eat in its naturalstate but processed foods. Soy oil is cheap and readily available, lendingitself to use in hundreds of packaged foods. Beef raised in feedlots on grain toachieve maximum bulk in the shortest period of time are much higher in omega-6sthan grass-fed beef (not to mention the widespread use of antibiotics andhormones in the beef and dairy industry). Also high in omega-6s are pork andchicken produced on conventional grain feed in the “factory” system, along withfactory eggs.This is why one of the harder choices we present is switching to grass-fed beef,along with naturally fed (also called pastured) chickens and their eggs. “Freerange” isn’t always reliable, since the birds might still be receiving someconventional feed. What makes this choice hard is that it’s expensive, and mostof the sources aren’t supermarkets.We didn’t bring up the issue of omega-6 imbalance to alarm you, only toillustrate the complexity of how food interacts with the body. Rebalancing thefatty acids in your diet comes down to some easy steps, with a general emphasis,as mentioned previously, of moving toward a plant-based diet, as the authorshave chosen to do, even though it’s not strictly vegetarian:RESTORING FATTY ACID BALANCE• Cook with safflower and olive oil; canola oil isn’t as good but is acceptable.• Eat unsalted or low-salt tree nuts, including walnuts, almonds, pecans, andBrazil nuts. Limit the amount of fatty nuts, such as cashews and macadamias, aswell as peanuts.• Eat seeds, including unsalted chia, sunflower, pumpkin, hemp, and flaxseeds.• Eat fatty fish—no more than 6 ounces per week. If vegetarian, eat morelower-fat tree nuts, such as walnuts and almonds, and seeds.• Avoid packaged foods with soy oil high in the list of ingredients.• Don’t cook with soy, sunflower, or corn oil.• Cut back or eliminate conventionally raised beef, pork, and chicken.• With any meat and poultry, buy lean cuts and trim the fat from other cuts.There is indication that our diets shouldn’t just be lower in omega-6s but muchhigher in omega-3s. Therefore it’s a major challenge to turn the American dietaround. (Vegetarians who rely heavily on soy products like tofu and wholesoybeans would be even more challenged.) Should you make a major push towardomega-3 fatty acids? Some experts believe that these should actually outnumberomega-6s in the diet, but we think the jury is still out on this issue. Amongnative populations, the Inuit, with their traditional marine diet and highintake of fish, are the only ones who have reversed the ratio, with omega-3soutnumbering omega-6s by 4:1. The Inuit were held up in the early excitementover omega-3s as examples of people with a very low risk of heart disease. Butlater studies found that the evidence for this claim was fragile, and inaddition, the blood-thinning properties of omega-3 fatty acids may be why Inuithave higher than normal mortality from strokes. The larger point is that gettingexcited over “miracle” foods or nutrients and worried over forbidden ones is arecipe for confusion. The great strength of human digestion is its adaptability.We are the ultimate omnivores. But we are also the only creatures who modifytheir diet according to ideas in our head and the traditions we are born into.We respect innovative ideas and traditions, but they also can be excuses forresisting good science and pursuing fads. Taking the route of easy choices seemsbest. The story doesn’t end with diet, of course. There are five more areas oflifestyle that complement the ability of food to change your microbiome,epigenome, and brain activity. Sometimes they work through anti-inflammation,yet there are other mechanisms that bring major benefits, too. Easy choices withlife-changing results can come from many directions."},{"pageContent":"STRESSAN ENEMY IN HIDINGBeing told to reduce the stress in our lives is largely falling on deaf ears.Modern life is stress. There’s no escape from the external pressures(technically known as stressors) that make everyone’s existence too fast, tooexhausting, and too demanding. Asking people to have less stress is like askingfish to have less water. We can try to shrug off stress as normal because it’sso prevalent, but the body cannot. Even an experience that might seem totallypositive, like winning the lottery or going on vacation, can trigger the samestress hormones as negative events.Most people accept that stress is harmful, excepting highly competitive typeswho claim to thrive on stress. An adrenaline junkie might rush to free-climb arock face without ropes, skydive, or wrestle an alligator with the full backingof media coverage that extols the rush of a thrill-seeking life. But medicalscience disagrees. The surge of stress hormones—principally adrenaline andcortisol, which carries the stress response forward—can be interpreted as athrill. Hidden from sight is physiological reality. These hormones lead to acascade of reactions, including elevated heart rate and blood pressure that yourbody is meant to endure for only a brief period under acute conditions. Whenprolonged and repeated, the stress response starts to damage tissues and organsthroughout the body.The hidden danger is from chronic stress, which is so constant and low lyingthat we fool ourselves into believing we’ve adapted to it. The body tells adifferent story. Imagine the following image:A shell-shocked soldier has been brought home from the battlefront. He looksnumbed and dazed. He complains of exhaustion but cannot sleep. Sharp, suddennoises create a state of alarm. When he’s not agitated, he is mentally dull andquite often depressed.This is the classic picture of acute stress when it has been prolonged beyondthe ability of the body to recover properly. Shell shock was thought once to bea sign of weakness or cowardice, but now we know that its basis isphysiological. Despite the fact that our tolerance for stress, like thetolerance for pain, varies widely from person to person, all soldiers willsuccumb to shell shock if subjected to acute stress hour after hour, as happenedto combat troops under constant shelling in the trenches during World War I.Now imagine yourself sitting down to watch TV in the evening when suddenly thedog next door starts to bark. You attempt to put the noise out of your mind, butthe dog won’t stop. This doesn’t count as acute stress. You won’t jump up with aclassic fight-or-flight response. Even so, you are being subjected to the samethree factors that aggravate all stress.Repetition: The dog keeps barking and won’t stop.Unpredictability: The barking came out of nowhere, and you don’t know when itwill end.Lack of control: You have no way to directly stop the dog from barking.It’s these three factors that generally lie behind the problem of chronicstress. Of course, they affect a frontline combatant far more severely. Beingshelled repeatedly, at unpredictable times, and without being able to stop theenemy artillery, multiplies the actual danger a dozen times over as comparedwith that from a neighbor’s barking dog. The stress response exists to protectyou from danger, however, and despite the higher brain’s ability to tell thedifference between a barking dog and trench warfare, the lower brain is stuckmillions of years ago in evolutionary time. It signals stress hormones to besecreted by the endocrine system, not in a flood but on rheostat control, as itwere. The drip-drip of a low-level stress response is as destructive as Chinesewater torture, and for the same reason. Given enough tiny, harmless stresses,the path to total breakdown is open.Everyone’s goal should be to prevent the aggravating factors in stress. Weconsider this true stress management. In the menu of choices below, manystressors can’t be entirely eliminated; modern life simply doesn’t allow for it.But there are important ways to improve your body’s reactions by insertingbetter messages into the feedback loop. After discussing the choices and whatthey mean, we’ll revisit the science that applies to stress management.Reading the menu: As in every section on lifestyle, the menu of choices isdivided into three parts, according to level of difficulty and proveneffectiveness.Part 1: Easy choicesPart 2: Harder choicesPart 3: Experimental choicesPlease consult this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page120] in thediet section if you need a refresher on what the three levels of choice areabout. Remember, too, that whatever choices you make are meant to be permanent.The question immediately arises, should you double up on choices, one for dietand one for stress? We know that for some people there’s a sense of urgency tomake changes in more than one area, and if you see easy choices in two areas—notjust diet and stress but any two of the six lifestyle areas we cover—it’s yourchoice to adopt them at the same time. We don’t think it’s the best strategy,though. If you overlap two choices, it’s more likely that you will lapse.Permanent change depends on making things easy and absorbing any new change intoyour existing lifestyle. One at a time seems like enough. Remember, if youchange only one thing a week, that’s fifty-two changes a year, which representsan enormous shift.You’ll immediately notice that meditation is the first choice listed understress. There’s a complete section on meditation beginning on this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#page171], which is where the maindiscussion takes place. To us, meditation is the most important strategy forreducing the stress response and rebalancing the mind-body system. Keep this inmind even though there are many other easy choices here. In the list of harderchoices, we advise dealing with negative emotions. That discussion can be foundin the emotions section beginning on this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page201], but we consider it a mainsource of protection from stress, too.STRESS: THE MENU OF CHOICESCIRCLE TWO TO FIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE EASY TO MAKE IN YOUR CURRENT STRESSMANAGEMENT. THE HARDER CHOICES SHOULD FOLLOW AFTER YOU HAVE ADOPTED THE EASYCHOICES, ONE PER WEEK.PART 1: EASY CHOICES• Meditate every day (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#page171]).• Decrease background noise and distractions at work.• Avoid multitasking. Deal with one thing at a time.• Stop being the cause of someone else’s stress (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml#page151]).• Vary your daily activity, including time out and downtime (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml#page152]).• Leave work on time at least three times a week.• Stop unloading your stress on family and friends.• Avoid people who are sources of pressure and conflict.• Be in contact with people who are meaningful to you.• Decrease boring and repetitive work.• Reduce alcohol to one beer or glass of wine a day, taken with a meal.• Take up a hobby.• Retreat from stressful situations quickly.• Find a physical outlet to unwind from daily stress.PART 2: HARDER CHOICES• Seek the most meaningful work you can find.• Be a manager instead of a worker.• Seek job security over money.• Save for the future. Be fully insured.• Become more accepting.• As much as you can, stop resisting.• Stop taking on too much responsibility.• Stop bringing work home. Leave the office at the office.• Take more days off from work.• Eliminate boring, repetitive work.• Enjoy Nature every day.• Find a close confidant.• Find a mentor.• Adopt a vision of the future.• Become a healer of stress (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml#page157]).• Deal with your negative emotions—anger, fear, anxiety, self-judgment,depression (see this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page201]).PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL CHOICES• Become your own boss.• Work toward a secure sense of self and higher self-esteem.• Become someone’s close confidant.• Become a mentor.• Take a course in crisis management.• Deal with long-standing psychological issues through therapy.EXPLAINING THE CHOICESWe’ve already mentioned that learning to meditate, which is a prime strategy forstress management, will be dealt with in a section of its own. Otherwise, you’llnotice that we’ve focused on work and the workplace. We’ve done this for tworeasons. First, almost everyone has to work with other people in an atmospherewhere stress inevitably arises; second, the other main source of stress,relationships, would need a whole book of its own, given how different allfamilies are. Making changes at work will teach you how the general principlesapply, and any reduction in stress can’t help but have benefits at home.Staying with the workplace for now, everyday pressures fall into threecategories: time pressure, peer pressure, and the pressure to perform. It’s rarefor anyone to be without these pressures as long as work means deadlines,coworkers, and performance goals. So how do you adapt to these constants? Mostpeople are reactive. They pay little heed to their repetitive patterns ofbehavior; therefore, they are highly ineffective at dealing with stress.BAD WAYS TO COPE WITH STRESSHOW MANY OF THE FOLLOWING INEFFECTUAL WAYS DO YOU USE TO DEAL WITH DAILYPRESSURES AT WORK?I react emotionally and sometimes blow up.I complain about the pressure I’m under, mostly to people who aren’t causing it.I pass the stress down the line, unloading it on someone else.I turn my back on the people who cause me the most stress, blocking them out asmuch as I can.I put up with stress until I get a chance to unwind (e.g., going to the gym,cocktail hour).I put even more pressure on myself and others, on the theory that it makes mestronger and more competitive.These behaviors are generally unconscious, because when examined rationally,they don’t achieve what they set out to do—decrease the harmful effects ofstress. Stress is a feedback loop. The input is the stressor (e.g., a tightdeadline, an obnoxious boss, an unreachable sales goal); the output is yourresponse. You have a choice to intervene anywhere along the loop by changing theinput or the output. The more consciously you intervene, the higher your chancesof reducing the bad effects of stress.In our menu of easy choices, some are directed at input, some at output. Forexample, you can stop multitasking, which has been shown in brain studies todecrease performance and increase inattention. You can perhaps reduce externalnoise and distractions around you at work. Both changes are on the input side.On the output side, you can improve your response to stress—you can stop passingyour stress on to other people, for example, and walk away from stressfulsituations as soon as possible.Perhaps the most important easy change, however, is to stop being the cause ofstress for others. This involves more self-awareness than the other easychoices, and becoming more self-aware is the closest thing we know of that canbe called a panacea, or cure-all. Some of the bad ways to manage stress havealready been mentioned. Basically, they involve putting stress on others whenyou should be coping with it yourself. Many of us do this inadvertently bybottling it up inside, closing down the lines of communication that could solvethe problem. Going to the gym to unwind may be good for you, but it does nothingfor the atmosphere at work. A high-strung boss only makes for stressedemployees.You are the source of stress when you make a habit of complaining andcriticizing. Complainers also find it hard to praise and appreciate others. Youare creating stress when you indulge in perfectionism, never being satisfieduntil every t is crossed. Even normal office behavior like forming cliques andgossiping behind someone else’s back is, if we face reality, a source of stressthat can be emotionally devastating. It amounts at times to little more thanbullying, a source of stress that goes without saying. Hold your behavior up tothe mirror, then see this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml#page157]to find out how you can become a healer of stress instead. As you begin to seethe results of being more self-aware, you can turn to the harder choices on themenu, which mostly deal with deeper habits that aren’t easy to break.Time management can also reduce stress in ways most people don’t pay attentionto. Varying your activity throughout the day opens many possibilities. Officework is sedentary, and the human body is meant to move. Getting up from yourchair once an hour is enough to reverse some of the adverse effects of anonphysical job. Decades ago a Yale physiologist took student athletes and hadthem lie in bed without getting up for an extended period—staying in bed was thetraditional protocol for hospital patients recovering from surgery as well asnew mothers. After two weeks in bed, the athletes lost the equivalent of twoyears of training as their muscles wasted away. Unexpectedly, it wasn’t simplystaying in bed that caused the damage—gravity played a part. If the subjectsstood up during the day, even doing minimal activity, most of the muscle wastingdidn’t occur, which is one reason that postoperative and maternity care nowemphasize getting up and around as soon as possible.Besides standing up and moving around at least once an hour, you should makespace during the workday for downtime, when you simply relax, and inner time,when you either meditate or simply sit quietly with your eyes closed. Theseactivities allow the whole system to reset itself. In addition, you will feelmore centered psychologically. Taking a few simple steps, it turns out, countersthe tendency for repetitive work to dull the mind. It’s the kind of low-levelstress that often goes unnoticed.The harder choices are self-explanatory, except for one: becoming a managerinstead of a worker. According to an old punch line, the boss says, “I don’t getheart attacks. I give them.” There’s physiological truth in that. The moreindependent you are, the less you find yourself following orders from above, thelower your stress level. This finding is unrelated to how many hours you work.The higher up you rise on the corporate ladder, the more likely you will loveyour job but the more likely you will also take it home with you. People wholove their jobs typically report that they work eighty hours a week between theoffice and home.Only the CEO of a company reports to no one higher up (he loses sleep over whatthe shareholders are demanding), which brings up one of our experimentalchoices. These choices focus on getting more independence by starting your ownbusiness, which most of us see as the ideal. But independence means more thanbeing your own boss. Developing a long-range vision for your life offers a muchmore meaningful kind of independence. Working on your deep psychological issuesopens the possibility for psychological freedom, making you independent of yourpast and the scars you carry around with you. These are meaningful choices thatgo beyond the limited definition of stress management, yet it’s this kind ofchange that transforms someone’s life.THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE CHANGESStress was the first area where the mind-body connection could be proved,opening the door for the flood of research and validation that exists today. Themain reason for focusing on stress was probably simplicity. It’s exacting anddifficult work to extract a neurotransmitter like serotonin or dopamine frombrain tissue. You must work with samples from dead tissue instead of in realtime, and of course the subjects are rarely human. But stress hormones likecortisol and adrenaline rush into the bloodstream in real time and can besampled on the spot by drawing blood. In addition, the physical effects offight-or-flight are easily observed in ourselves.Significant findings fine-tuned what was happening, which is how stressresearchers were able to prove that unpredictability, repetition, and lack ofcontrol are the aggravating factors in stress. In a classic experiment, micewere placed in cages wired to administer mild electrical shocks. In itself, eachshock was harmless. But the experiments administered the shocks repeatedly atrandom intervals, and the mice had nowhere to escape. After only a few days, theanimals became dull and listless. Their immune response was severelycompromised, and some actually died from the “harmless” shocks. This experimentallowed for the understanding of how low-level chronic stress damages the body.It also dispelled the myth that succumbing to repeated stress was a sign ofweakness or some other character flaw—the physiology simply can’t help itself.In the era of epigenetics these findings have penetrated to the deepest level ofour physiology, with increasing hope that people can modify and improve theirstress response. Not only the food you eat but also your level of stress cancause epigenetic modifications and alter gene activities. In a study of theeffects of the Holocaust on gene activity, researchers at Mount Sinai’s IcahnSchool of Medicine in New York City took 80 children who had at least one parentwho was a Holocaust survivor and compared them with 15 “demographically similar”children whose parents didn’t go through the Holocaust. The results aredescribed in a moving first-person account by one child of a survivor, JosieGlausiusz, in a June 2014 issue of Nature.For two weeks in the spring of 1945, Glausiusz’s father, “his mother and threesurviving brothers had been packed onto a train along with 2,500 other prisonersof Bergen-Belsen, the concentration camp in Germany where my father had beenincarcerated since 6 December 1944,” she writes. “For 14 days, while the familysurvived on minuscule rations of scavenged raw potato peels and maize, the ‘LostTrain’ snaked haphazardly through Eastern Germany, blocked by the advances ofthe Russian and American armies, before halting in a forest near the smallGerman town of Tröbitz.”Unknown to the passengers trapped in boxcars, their German captors had decoupledthe locomotive and escaped during the night. Suddenly two Russian cavalrymenappeared on white horses and systematically broke the locks that held the campprisoners in.Having grown up on this harrowing tale, Glausiusz volunteered for the MountSinai study in 2012. It was led by Rachel Yehuda, a neuroscientist and thedirector of the school’s division on traumatic stress. The aim of the study was“to determine whether the risk of mental illness owing to trauma is biologicallypassed from one generation to the next. In particular, the researchers wanted tosee whether such risk could be inherited through epigenetic marks.”Reporting on what her participation entailed, Glausiusz writes, “During thecourse of the study, I completed an online questionnaire to assess my emotionalhealth as the daughter of Holocaust survivors and whether my parents hadpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A psychologist interviewed me about myparents’ war-time experiences and my own history of depression and anxiety. Isubmitted to blood and urine tests measuring the hormone cortisol, which enablesthe body to respond to stress, as well as the methylation of GR-1F, a promoterof a gene that encodes a glucocorticoid receptor, which binds cortisol and helpsshut down the stress response.”The findings turned out to be somewhat contradictory, depending on which parentsuffered from PTSD as a Holocaust survivor. To simplify, the key was determiningif epigenetic marks led to more or less cortisol circulating in the bloodstreamof their children. Children whose parents both had PTSD were found to have moregene activity leading to the production of the glucocorticoid receptor thathelps turn off the stress response by binding with cortisol (i.e., rendering itineffective). Turning on the gene turns off the stress.The results were mixed with a single parent who had PTSD. It appears “thatchildren of fathers with PTSD are ‘probably more prone to depression or chronicstress responses,’ Yehuda says. [But] the reverse seems to occur in theoffspring of mothers with PTSD.” These children showed lower cortisol levels.Why?One possible explanation: “Mothers who survived the Holocaust, [Yehuda] says,often feared separation from their children. ‘When you’ve been exposed to a lotof loss, and you’re very worried that you will keep losing loved ones, you mayliterally hang on too tight.’ Holocaust offspring, she says, often complain thattheir mothers were overattached to them.“Although she does not identify the mechanism behind these changes, Yehudathinks that epigenetic modifications might occur before conception in thefathers, but that in the mothers the changes occur either before conception orduring gestation.”We were reluctant to bring up such horrific experiences, except that thisHolocaust study marked a breakthrough. According to Yehuda, as far as her teamwas aware, “This is the first evidence in humans…of an epigenetic mark in anoffspring based on pre-conception exposure in a parent.” (A previous experimentin mice, already mentioned, had shown that whether a baby mouse had good or badmothering led to epigenetic marks that affected the stress response; nurturingbehavior by the good mothers reduced anxious behavior in their offspring alongwith lowered cortisol levels.) It’s also important to note that the study iscontroversial, largely because the biochemistry of gender differences iscomplex, and the differences found by Yehuda were small, or as she puts it,“nuanced.” It should also be noted that without being able to spot theepigenetics involved, psychiatry had long been aware, through various studies,that the effects of PTSD can be passed on to children of Holocaust survivors.MAKING THE SCIENCE WORKAn old joke says, “Gray hair is inherited. You get it from your children.” Thescience shows that it turns both ways. We may care a great deal more about howstress will get passed on in our families than at work. But the best approach inboth places is the same: become a healer of stress. Your behavior today islikely to have consequences far into the future.When you have an awareness that you aren’t just the victim of stress but apotential source, your behavior changes. Here are some positive choices torelieve the stress around you at work, and they can be applied to relationshipsand family as well.HOW TO BE A HEALER OF STRESSHOW MANY OF THE FOLLOWING POSITIVE BEHAVIORS DO YOU PRACTICE?Asking others how they feel and listening to the answer.Not insisting that you get your own way.Always showing respect for everyone. Never belittling or scapegoating.Never criticizing someone in public.Accepting input from as many people as possible.Praising and appreciating other people’s work.Being loyal in order to win loyalty.Not gossiping or backbiting.Waiting until you are calm before addressing a situation that makes you angry.Giving coworkers and employees enough space to make their own decisions.Being open to new ideas, no matter whom they come from.Not favoring a small circle to the exclusion of everyone else.Addressing tension as it arises instead of denying it or hoping it will solveitself.Not being a perfectionist who can never be satisfied.Treating both sexes equally.If you have already adopted most or all of the behaviors listed here,congratulations—you are already a healer of stress. Most of us, however, mustmake a conscious effort to change our ways, either in small or large part. Noneof us are being subjected to lab experiments on stress, yet in a very real wayour lives are the laboratories in which we confront a host of stresses. It’s upto us to become self-aware so that we understand the part we play in a world allbut overwhelmed by demands, pressure, and crises. The individual is the sourceof healing, a truth that never wears out with retelling."},{"pageContent":"EXERCISETURNING GOOD INTENTIONS INTO ACTIONThe secret to exercise can be told in a single phrase: keep going, don’t stop.It’s better to be active all your life at any level, including mild activity,than to play sports in high school and college, only to sit back as the yearsadvance. Consistency is the main goal, not breaking a sweat. But this takes aconscious choice, one you are willing to stick with. The good news is that themore you keep on moving your body, the more you’ll want to. Physical activitybecomes a habit you adapt to rather quickly, not to mention that it helps createnew pathways in the brain.Modern life has made exercise a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that weare no longer slaves to backbreaking physical labor; the curse is that theblessing has gone too far. Modern life for most people is physically too soft,yet despite the price our bodies pay, we seem to prefer it that way. Given achoice, most people chooseSitting still instead of moving aroundPleasurable distractions (TV, video games, the Internet) instead of playingsportsMental work instead of physical workLetting machines instead of muscles perform physical tasksLetting their children spend more time on the computer and less time playingoutsideThese are all modern choices, and the trend hasn’t stopped moving in theirdirection. As long as it does, the drawbacks of a sedentary life, such asincreased obesity and type 2 diabetes, will plague society, while the benefitsof exercise—in terms of cardiovascular health, avoidance of some types ofcancers, and improved mental status—will be missed opportunities. As of 2013,only 20 percent of American adults got the recommended amount of regularexercise, which is 2.5 hours of moderate aerobic exercise per week or half thattime spent in vigorous aerobic exercise. Someone between the ages of eighteenand twenty-four is twice as likely to exercise as someone over sixty-five—31percent versus 16 percent—even though it’s evident that the two groups thatbenefit the most from physical activity are the very young and the very old.For our ancestors, rest was a luxury; for most of us, finding the time to go tothe gym is the luxury. At the turn of the twentieth century, around 80 percentof the calories expended to run a farm still came from the farmer using hismuscles. This was true despite the invention of farm machinery and thewidespread use of horses to draw plows, harvesters, and wagons. Such a life,where physical activity was hard and constant, was how we evolved. Our bodiesare well adapted to much more activity than you’d suppose. There is evidencethat primitive hunter-gatherers had a life span as long as seventy years. Whatshortened their lives were external conditions—disease, childhood mortality,exposure to the elements—not the built-in frailty of the body.Because most of us don’t have to hunt, gather, till the soil, fork hay into thehayloft, or make our own bread—the list can be extended ad infinitum—there’salmost no essential physical work left. Therefore no matter how often we hearthe drumbeat of diet and exercise, good intentions outweigh action. It’s becausecompliance is so low that we put stress management above exercise in ourlifestyle list. More people are more likely to reduce the pressure in theirdaily lives than to get up out of their chairs and start moving.We are realists, and we know that scolding will never motivate people to changetheir ways. Guilt only leads to unused gym memberships. Neither will the balanceof pain and pleasure serve as motivation. Anyone who enjoys exercise is highlylikely to have been running, lifting weights, or playing sports since childhood.Their bodies are conditioned to it, and the feedback loop that leads to therunner’s high or to the “good tired” of a workout is a source of pleasure. Forsomeone who isn’t in the habit of exercising, though, the reverse is true.Exercise affects the body like physical labor, leading (at the beginning) tofatigue and sore muscles. The body of someone who doesn’t exercise is habituatedto sitting still, the ill effects of which are mostly long term. It can takeyears before the reality of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and excessive weightactually begins to dawn.Our goal, then, is to provide easy choices that can change the feedback loop,which means that a little activity leads to wanting more. In addition, therecommended changes must be maintained for a lifetime. Getting active in spurtswith long periods of no activity in between isn’t good for you. Adaptation comesnaturally when it’s regular and steady. Better to walk up a flight of stairsevery day than to shovel snow off the driveway six times a winter.Reading the menu: As in every section on lifestyle, the menu of choices isdivided into three parts, according to level of difficulty and proveneffectiveness.Part 1: Easy choicesPart 2: Harder choicesPart 3: Experimental choicesPlease consult this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page120] in thediet section if you need a refresher on what the three levels of choice areabout.

THE HARDER CHOICES SHOULD FOLLOW AFTER YOU HAVE ADOPTED THEEASY CHOICES, ONE PER WEEK.PART 1: EASY CHOICES• Get up and move around once an hour.• When taking an elevator, take the stairs to the second floor before pressingthe button.• Do your own housework instead of hiring a cleaner.• Take a brisk walk after dinner.• Choose the far corner of a parking lot (as long as it’s safe and well lit).• If you already walk your dog every day, make the walk longer and brisker.• If a destination is less than half a mile, walk instead of drive.• Buy an exercise step and use it for 15 minutes every day as you watch TV orlisten to music.• Go outside for 5 to 10 minutes three times a day.• Take up gardening, golf, or a similar activity that you actually enjoy.• Set aside 5 to 10 minutes a day for calisthenics.• Do more than half the chores around your house.• Work with light weights as you watch TV.PART 2: HARDER CHOICES• Acquire more-active friends and join them in their activities.• Devote half of your lunch hour to exercise.• If you take children to the park, play with them instead of watching.• When using an elevator, take the stairs to the third or fourth floor beforepressing the button.• Plan a shared exercise activity with your partner or spouse twice a week.• Buy an exercise step and use it for at least 30 minutes every day as you watchTV or listen to music.• Resume a sport you used to love.• Do 5 to 10 minutes of calisthenics twice a day.• Walk for a total of 3 hours a week.• Do all your own yard work.• Volunteer to help the needy with housecleaning, painting, and repairs.• Take hikes every weekend in good weather.• Use a trainer at the gym.PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL CHOICES• Join an exercise class.• Take up yoga (see this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c009_r1.xhtml#page165]).• Lead a hiking group.• Train for a competitive sport and keep at it.• Find a regular exercise buddy.• Take up tennis.EXPLAINING THE CHOICESThe easy choices on the menu are quite easy. They would have to accumulate quitea lot to equal the official recommendation of 2.5 hours of moderate aerobicactivity a week, combined with some additional time at weight training. Butthose recommendations might as well come from another planet if you lead aninactive life. The good news is this: Getting up out of your chair brings themost benefit. Moving away from a completely sedentary life is the major step inpreventing the bad effects of getting no exercise. The risk of disease risessharply as you age if you don’t move around. Drastic inactivity eventually leadsto a 30 percent higher mortality rate for men and double the mortality rate forwomen. The “new old age,” in which seniors remain active and vital well beyondsixty-five, reversed one of the unhealthiest trends in social life.The more activity you add, the better your body will respond. If you go fromjogging a mile to running a mile, the good effects will increase. What yourheart, brain, circulatory system, blood fats, and blood sugar need most is someactivity, after which you can think about adding more.In middle age, getting physical decreases the risk of chronic illness.Statistical measurement has proved the point over and over. Unlike other riskfactors, however, exercising is more than statistical. It improves everyindividual life, at every level of activity. In very old people, eighty andabove, weight training for a few minutes with minimal effort (using only afive-pound weight, for example) can double or triple muscle tone.Our focus isn’t on how much weight you can lift or how fast you can run. We wantto level the curve so that physical activity isn’t mostly for the young, with asharp falling off in middle and old age. Leveling the curve is much moreimportant than being really active in your youth and inactive in old age. Yourbody adapts to what you do all the time, not what you do every once in a while.This is also the secret for making exercise pleasurable—the feedback loopbetween muscles and brain gets enlivened the more you use it. Just like a bicepsor abdominal muscle that atrophies with disuse, the body’s feedback loops needto be utilized, and the more messages they transmit, the livelier they become.Of course, we hope that you will move on to the harder choices on the menu. Giveit time. If you spend two months taking the stairs to the second floor beforepushing the elevator button, the next step—walking to the third or fourthfloor—becomes effortless. But if you decide tomorrow to walk to the fourthfloor, you are likely to feel exhausted, and your body will get the message“This is work.” It’s not the right message, not if you intend to make taking thestairs a pleasurable choice.If we had to choose the single activity that does the most for body and mindtogether, it would be yoga. The correct term is Hatha Yoga, which is only onelimb of the ancient tradition of Yoga, which has eight limbs in all. The othershave to do with mind and behavior, but the body cannot be excluded in thepursuit of higher consciousness. In Sanskrit Yoga means “union” and is relatedto the English word yoke. As mysterious as the concept of enlightenment mayseem, Yoga makes sense in its goal of bringing the mind, body, and spirit intoharmony. Each position (or Asana pose) that’s taught in Yoga is about focusingthe mind to direct the flow of physical energy in the body.Not that the two are separate. When consciousness moves, so does the energy. Theteachings of Hatha Yoga can be quite subtle and even esoteric. The flow of lifeenergy (Prana) that is regulated by the breath can be trained in exquisitelyprecise ways. The flow of life energy connected directly by the mind (Shakti) iseven more precise and exact. It’s taught that a single syllable in a mantra, forexample, has influences that extend from mind and body throughout the entireenvironment.The topic is so fascinating that we are devoting a section to consciousness asthe pivot between everyday well-being and radical well-being. Hatha Yoga is astep in that direction. It improves body awareness, gets you back intophysicality, sharpens your focus, and tones your muscles at the same time.Ironically, the practice is taken up mostly by men in India and mostly by womenin this country. In India, the pursuit of higher consciousness is open toeveryone in theory, but in practice women have been excluded. In America, mentypically disdain yoga because it’s not weight training or aerobic. Bothattitudes are skewed and need to change.THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE CHANGESAt the moment, the epigenetics of exercise is so new that few studies exist, butthis hasn’t stopped genetics from making its biggest contribution. We now knowthat being holistic isn’t just someone’s personal preference—it’s necessary foreveryone. Because hundreds and sometimes thousands of gene activities arechanged through lifestyle choices, exercise can’t be isolated from diet or dietfrom stress. This shift has enormous implications.For example, health care providers used to minimize the health risks of leadinga sedentary life. If you asked a physician thirty years ago what was wrong withhaving no physical activity, almost the only thing he’d come up with is disuseatrophy—the wasting of muscle tissue when a muscle isn’t being used. Now werealize that a broad range of mind-body problems arise from a sedentarylifestyle, spanning heart disease, anxiety and depression, hypertension, anddiabetes. The affectionate image of a plump grandma sitting in her rocking chairhas become an image of bad health and decreased well-being.These ill effects can be gleaned by looking at statistics for the generalpopulation, but epigenetics will one day be able to fine-tune an individual’spersonal risk. Sometimes what’s true for a large number of people isn’t true foryou the individual. Across the population it’s a well-established fact, forinstance, that inactivity leads to obesity through the simple formula thatexpending fewer calories than you take in will develop body fat. But as we’veseen, the old belief “calories in, calories out” has been revised.To get at a possible genetic link between physical activity and body fat, astudy carried out at Lund University in Sweden investigated the effects ofphysical activity on epigenetic gene modifications in fat cells. The researchersfound that exercise led to epigenetic shifts in gene activity (via methyl marks)that affected fat storage in the body. They looked at the genomes of fat cellsin twenty-three healthy men aged thirty-five before and after attending aerobicsclasses for six months, roughly twice a week. They found that exercise led toepigenetic changes in seven thousand genes, many of which led to genome-widechanges in DNA methylation in fat cells, shifting activity to enhance fat cellmetabolism.Methylation can remove methyl groups if they are properly exposed by histones,which work hand in hand with DNA in epigenetic modification by either exposingit to epigenetic marks or burying it—in essence, the switch is either madeavailable or not. With exercise, methylation patterns change: some genes aresilenced by methyl marks and others are unsilenced by demethylation. These arecomplex changes, but in essence, switches are turned off (downregulated) forpro-inflammatory genes while anti-inflammatory genes are switched on(upregulated). No doubt the mounting evidence about lifestyle changes willexpand the anti-inflammation story across the entire mind-body system.Weight loss is a common goal when people begin to exercise, but exercise leadsto mixed results. The number of calories consumed through physical activityisn’t as great as people suppose. A slightly brisk walk burns 280 calories perhour. Hiking, gardening, dancing, and engaging in weight training burn around350 calories per hour. At 290 calories per hour, bicycling under 10 miles anhour burns off little more energy than walking. If your physical activity isvigorous—running, swimming, or aerobics—energy consumption increases to between475 and 550 calories per hour. But even playing a vigorous game of baseballburns off only 440 calories per hour. Considering that a medium-size blueberrymuffin contains 425 calories, there’s good reason why exercise alone isn’t thesolution to weight loss.However, if we take a holistic perspective, so much else changes when you becomephysically active that calories diminish in importance. In one study, overweightpeople were divided into three groups. The first group ran a mile, the secondgroup jogged a mile, and the third group walked a mile. At the end of the trialperiod, the group that lost the most weight was the one that walked. One reasonis metabolic. Once you break into a sweat, your body goes from aerobicmetabolism, which burns calories, to anaerobic metabolism, which doesn’t. Sothere are instances in which less pain means more gain. Keeping exercise lightbut constant seems to be the key. Yet even this bright note is offset by thefact that exercise, being physical work, can make you hungrier. In addition,heavier exercise builds muscle mass, which is heavier than body fat. We’veconsidered these variables and keep coming back to the basic principle that youshould make easy changes and keep on going, not stopping.Very little has been discovered about the epigenetic effect of trying to loseweight. On the one hand, it appears that adult obesity goes back to childhoodand adolescent experiences that extend into later years. Methylation may haveimprinted bad habits and overeating into a person’s gene activity. There is alsothe question of how much of an epigenetic influence gets passed on from obeseparents to their children. We’ve been citing the data from the Dutch famine ofWorld War II, but that evidence comes from extreme starvation, which then led togenetic modifications that apparently raised the risk of obesity in children,depending on whether their mothers were pregnant during famine times or times ofplenty. It’s quite another thing to sort out epigenetic marks according to whichcause is at work, since obese parents can easily pass on bad eating behavior aswell as epigenetic marks from their own experience before and during pregnancy.Just as significant may be a Spanish study that took 204 obese or overweightteenagers and put them on a ten-week weight-loss regimen. It’s well known thatbeing obese as an adolescent leads to higher risk for a range of diseases inadulthood, not just the risk for being an obese adult. The program in this studywas multifaceted. The teenagers were given personalized diet and exerciseprograms. They attended weekly meetings that gave them more nutritional andexercise information, along with psychological support.At the end of the ten weeks, the researchers selected out the subjects who wereconsidered either high or low responders to the program, depending on BMI (bodymass index, which looks at the percentage of fat in the body) and the amount ofweight lost. Looking at their epigenomes, some strong correlations were found.The high and low responders showed differences in methylation in ninety-sevendifferent sites along their DNA. As reported online at the epigenetics siteEpiBeat, there was a link to inflammation. “The involved genes belong tonetworks related to cancer, inflammatory response, cell cycle, immune celltrafficking, hematological system development and function.”In five sites the changes were so different that simply by examining the methylmarks there, one could predict who would be a low or high responder to aweight-loss program. The differences increased, the better someone responded tothe program. These results offer two possibilities. First, epigenetic profilingmay enable us to know in advance who will find it easy or hard to lose weight.Second, we may be able to pinpoint the gene activities that physical exercisepromotes.Making the gene connection more precise solves only part of the problem. It wasoriginally thought that methylation occurred in the womb and lasted for alifetime. Now it’s realized that epigenetic changes are dynamic, constant, andoften very rapid, taking place in twenty-four hours. Chemicals known asdemethylases can remove methyl marks, and they have been connected to a specificgene (for fat mass and obesity-related transcript). Variants of this one geneare more associated with risk for obesity than any other genes. As reported byepigenetic researchers at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, it’s thoughtthat the instructions encoded in FTO create a protein that acts as ademethylase. This protein may act to turn off or on the genes that createobesity, although the exact mechanism isn’t known, nor is it known why FTO isrelated to obesity. But the key finding is that regular exercise “largely erasesthe increased risk for obesity associated with the versions of the FTO gene. Noone then is doomed by their genes,” said team leader Molly Bray.When it comes to the microbiome, there’s been little study connecting itdirectly with exercise. One intriguing finding, however, comes from Ireland,where a team from the University College Cork compared forty professional rugbyplayers with a control group of healthy adult males. The athletes were atpre-season training camp, which is a controlled environment—they ate and playedtogether. The investigators looked at blood markers for inflammation that werealso connected to immunity and metabolism.It turns out that the athletes had a much more diverse microbiome. They werealso improved over the control group in regard to markers for inflammation,immune response, and metabolism. Although some of the improvement could havebeen through diet, this seems to be a significant finding, if a very generalone, about how gut microbes respond to exercise.Given the present state of the science, we feel that the best practical courseis to rely on demethylation through positive lifestyle choices—in other words,doing what you can today to regulate the genes that are beneficial, with a focuson lowering markers of inflammation. To date, there’s no way to target only thechanges related to body weight, but that’s not essential for most people whoaren’t significantly overweight. A general program of the kind we’rerecommending is the best medicine anyone has yet devised with good sciencebehind it."},{"pageContent":"MEDITATIONTHE CENTERPIECE OF YOUR WELL-BEING?The title of this section poses a question. Should you take up meditation as theprimary choice for improving your well-being? Its benefits are cumulative. Themore you do it, the better the results. But how many people begin to meditateand then stop after a while? In our experience, this has become a bigger problemthan convincing someone to start. The same frazzled pressures that motivatepeople to seek the quiet oasis of meditation also cause them to quit. Theexcuses are generally about not having enough time or simply forgetting tomeditate. Many look upon meditating as a kind of Band-Aid for patching up anespecially bad day. “I’m feeling good today. I don’t need to meditate” goesalong with the notion of meditation as a quick boost, like a protein shake.Our focus in this section will be on why meditation should be a lifelongpractice. We know this is a major lifestyle change. It represents a unique kindof commitment, and the inconvenience can be considerable. Stopping to meditatebreaks up the active routine of the day; it isolates you from contact with otherpeople; its benefits are largely invisible. For all that, devotion to meditationalso brings unique benefits.It’s a modern twist to look upon meditation for physical results, but studies onblood pressure, heart rate, and stress-related symptoms were the opening wedgethat brought meditation into public acceptance in the West. Having your doctorrecommend meditation bypassed the issue of whether you should “believe in it.”This was a huge divergence from the East, where meditation has traditionallybeen for enlightenment, a concept the West looked upon suspiciously as anunfathomable mystery and probably unattainable except by swamis, yogis, gurus,and mystics.The same fork in the road still exists. As a lifestyle choice, meditationappeals to people who want to see improvements in their health. As a spiritualchoice, meditation appeals to people who want to reach a higher state ofconsciousness. It’s this second group, we strongly suspect, who keep meditatingregularly for years and perhaps a lifetime. Their goal may be invisible, butit’s clear and creates long-term motivation. On the other hand, if you take upmeditation to feel better, there’s not a strong reason to do it on the days whenyou already feel good.MEDITATION AND SUCCESSOur way to get past this problem is simple: Make meditation the centerpiece ofyour total well-being. Adopt it, not because you are motivated to meditate, butbecause you will use it as a means to get something you want very badly. Only aneed that is tied to desire will be fulfilled. Desire is the most powerfulmotivator, but in most people’s lives there’s no need to meditate the waythere’s a need for food, shelter, companionship, money, and sex. One strongdesire, however, is general enough and long-lasting enough to fit the bill:success. If meditation can be linked to success, we feel that many more peoplewould stick with it.Making this connection requires a major shift, however. Both sides of themeditation divide—those who want better health and those who want higherconsciousness—focus on a goal that is very different from worldly success. Ifyou listed the most prominent traits of millionaires, entrepreneurs, and CEOs ofmajor corporations, their success wouldn’t be attributable to meditating. Butthe stereotype of the ambitious, competitive, and ruthless climber doesn’tsquare with reality.The bottom line is that success is a more potent word—and a strongermotivator—than prevention, wellness, and well-being. The attributes of highlysuccessful people can be linked with the benefits of meditation.ELEMENTS OF SUCCESSThe ability to make good decisionsA strong sense of selfBeing able to focus and concentrateNot being easily distractedImmune to the approval or disapproval of othersSufficient energy for long workdaysNot easily discouragedEmotional resilience, bouncing back after failure and setbacksIntuition and insight, being able to read a situation ahead of othersA stream of new ideas and solutionsA cool head in a crisisStrong coping skills in the face of high stressIf these aren’t yet considered the key traits associated with success, theyshould be. Each trait is strengthened through meditation. How many peoplerealize that they can make better decisions if they meditate, or keep a coolerhead in a crisis? The stereotype of the navel-gazing, self-absorbed meditator isjust as false as the ruthless climber clawing his way to success. The mainreason that meditation caught on for many people in the West was that doctorsand psychologists found a way around the image of the world-renouncing yogi witha long beard isolated in his Himalayan cave. But only recently has research inaltered gene activities proved that meditation creates thousands of changes withholistic implications for mind and body.That’s a great advance, but attitudes need to shift even more. When success isdefined by externals—money, possessions, status, and power—it’s granted to thefew, who usually begin from a privileged background. But what if success isdefined differently, as an inner state of fulfillment? If you turn within, youcan be successful at this very moment, because success is a creative process.You are engaged in it already, because true success is something we live. It’snot an end state we arrive at. This is the message Deepak has been spreading forthirty years and exemplifying in his own life. It’s the message he takes tobusiness schools every year, teaches to CEOs, and expands upon in books likethis one—and Rudy found that even before they met, he and Deepak had beenwalking the same path.Reading the menu: As in every section on lifestyle, the menu of choices isdivided into three parts, according to level of difficulty and proveneffectiveness.Part 1: Easy choicesPart 2: Harder choicesPart 3: Experimental choicesPlease consult this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page120] in thediet section if you need a refresher on what the three levels of choice areabout. You should make one change per week total, not one from each lifestylesection. Remember, too, that whatever choices you make are meant to bepermanent.MEDITATION: THE MENU OF CHOICESCIRCLE TWO TO FIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE EASY TO MAKE IN YOUR CURRENT LIFESTYLEIN REGARD TO MEDITATION. THE HARDER CHOICES SHOULD FOLLOW AFTER YOU HAVE ADOPTEDTHE EASY CHOICES, ONE PER WEEK.PART 1: EASY CHOICES• Take 10 minutes at lunchtime to sit alone with eyes closed.• Learn a simple breath meditation for use 10 minutes morning and evening (seethis page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#page176] for instructions).• Use a mindfulness technique several times a day (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#page176] for instructions).• Take up simple mantra meditation for 10 minutes twice a day (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#page176] for instructions).• Find a friend to meditate with.• Take inward time whenever you find it helpful, at least once a day.PART 2: HARDER CHOICES• Join an organized meditation course.• Increase your meditation to 20 minutes twice a day.• Make meditation a shared practice with your spouse or partner.• Add some simple yoga poses to precede your meditation.• Add 5 minutes of Pranayama (breath technique) before meditating (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#page177] for instructions).• Teach your children to meditate.PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL CHOICES• Investigate the spiritual traditions behind meditation.• Go on a meditation retreat.• Become a meditation teacher.• Explore taking meditation to the elderly.• Explore introducing meditation at a local school.EXPLAINING THE CHOICESThe easy choices on the menu are about finding minimal time during your day togo inward. The simplest means are a kind of pre-meditation, simply sitting witheyes closed or even defining “inner time” any way you want, just as long as youget to be alone with yourself, eliminating as much external noise anddistraction as possible. Of course, we hope you are ready for meditation itself,yet if this is going to be a permanent change, don’t rush into a commitment youcan’t keep. Fortunately, many people are surprised by how easily they take tomeditating and enjoy the opportunity for inner time every day.Breath meditation: This is a simple technique that takes advantage of themind-body connection. Your breath is a fundamental bodily rhythm that isconnected to heart rate, stress response, blood pressure, and many physiologicalrhythms. But it’s also connected to mood—notice what a relief it is to take deepbreaths when you are upset, and how ragged the breath becomes when you feelanxious or stressed. A breath meditation, then, helps restore the whole systemand brings deep relaxation without effort.The technique is simple. Sit with your eyes closed in a quiet place. Once youfeel settled, follow your breathing as it goes in and out. Don’t force yourbreathing into a rhythm or try to make it change. If your attention getsdistracted by stray thoughts or sensations, easily bring it back to your breath.Some people find it helpful to put their attention on the tip of the nose, wherethe sensation of inhaling and exhaling is easy to focus on. Continue to followyour breath for the period you’ve set aside as meditation time, but sit andrelax for a moment after you’re finished. Don’t jump up and become activeimmediately.Mantra meditation: One of the most intricate and subtle branches of the Indianspiritual tradition has to do with sound (Shubda). The specific mantras thatemerged from this tradition were valued for their vibrational effect, not theirmeaning. In the modern era there is no consensus about how thinking a specificword could affect the brain, and yet thousands of people have reported thatmeditating with a mantra brings a deeper, more profound experience.Sometimes mantras are personalized according to criteria that a teacher has beentrained in (such as a person’s age, date of birth, or various psychologicalpredispositions), but there are also mantras for general use. If you want to trymantra meditation, follow the same technique as for the breath meditation justgiven. As you breathe in and out, silently use the mantra So Hum. The usualmethod is to use So as you inhale and Hum as you exhale.Think each syllable slowly and quietly as you breathe. Don’t force the thought,and if you get distracted, easily return to the mantra. Some teaching makes thepoint that mantra meditation shouldn’t be tied to any rhythm, even the naturalrhythm of breathing. An alternative technique is proposed where you sit quietlyand think So Hum, then let go of the mantra and think it again only as it arisesin the mind. You gently remind yourself to say it regularly, not simply ignoringthe mantra. It’s a matter of easily giving it preference over other thoughts.Don’t set up a regular rhythm, however, and never try to drum the mantra intoyour head.Once you’ve meditated for a set period, it’s important to sit still—or betteryet lie down—and relax for a moment before returning to activity. Since mantrameditation takes many people so deep, it’s jarring to jump up immediatelywithout a period of letting your mind rise back up to the surface of everydaythoughts.Pranayama: Because breathing is so intimately connected to every activity in thebody, you might consider some ancient techniques from the Yoga tradition thatcenter on the breath. Although these can be quite intricate and time consumingwhen someone sets out to control or direct their breathing, there are also easyforms of Pranayama, as these techniques are called. The one we recommend is forrefining our breathing and adding to the relaxation and calming effect of yourmeditation.Sitting upright, you will be gently breathing out of your left nostril and rightnostril alternately. The rhythm is to inhale on the right side, then exhale onthe left before switching to inhale on the left and exhale on the right. A fewminutes’ practice makes this quite easy, actually.First hold your right hand up with your thumb against your right nostril and twomiddle fingers against the left nostril.Gently close the left nostril and inhale through the right. Now exhale throughthe left nostril by moving your fingers away and gently closing the rightnostril with your thumb.Don’t move your hand yet, and inhale through the left nostril. Then close thatnostril with your fingers and move away your thumb to open the rightnostril—exhale.It sounds tricky when written out this way, but you are essentially alternatingthe side you breathe on. You may find it easier to get the knack if you beginthe first couple of tries by exhaling and inhaling on the right, then switchyour hand position and exhale and inhale on the left.In any case, be easy with your Pranayama, doing it for five minutes beforestarting to meditate. Most people have a dominant nostril that changesthroughout the day. Sometimes you are breathing mostly on the right or the left,probably because one nostril is more open than the other. Pranayama is supposedto even out and refine the breath. This can feel odd at first, so if you findyourself growing short of breath or wanting to gasp, stop the practice, sitquietly, and resume normal breathing. Never force your breathing using thetechnique. Each exhale and inhale should be completely natural. Don’t try toinstill a regular rhythm or to make your breaths deeper or shallower. It takesmore discipline to adopt Pranayama than to adopt simple meditation, but thosewho master it report deeper experiences in their meditation.THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE CHANGESThe genome and epigenetics are beginning to reveal more about how meditationworks. In 2014 we tested the effects of intensive meditation by assessing theactivity of genes spanning the entire human genome. The study was conducted at aretreat at the Chopra Center located in Carlsbad, California, just outside SanDiego.Sixty-four healthy women from the community were invited to stay at the La CostaResort for one week—the Chopra Center has its facilities there—and were thenrandomly assigned either to a meditation retreat or to a relaxation retreatonly, excluding learning to meditate. Serving as controls for the study, therelaxation retreat group would basically spend the time just being on vacation.During the week, blood samples were collected from both groups and measured foraging-related biomarkers.In addition, any changes in psychological and spiritual well-being were alsoassessed, not only over the week but continuing up to ten months afterward. Byday five, both groups actually underwent significant improvements in theirmental health and beneficial changes in their gene activities, including loweractivity of genes involved in defensive stress and immune responses (you’llrecall that inflammation is a defensive response of the immune system). In thecontrol group, these beneficial changes could be attributed to something termedthe “vacation effect,” in which stress levels are minimized and the genes thatusually deal with stress and injury can “take a rest.” The body acts as if allis well and can turn all those stress response genes down.But other changes occurred in the meditation group that did not happen in thecontrols. For example, there was two- to threefold suppression of a geneactivity associated with viral infection and wound healing. There were alsobeneficial changes in the genes associated with risk for Alzheimer’s disease.These changes suggest that it would be more difficult for the meditators toexperience a viral infection while at the same time their systems were lessconcerned about the need to heal wounds or tend to injury.Perhaps the most astonishing result specifically found in the meditators was adramatic increase in the anti-aging activity of telomerase. The importance ofthis change is explained in the newest edition of Deepak’s book on the mind-bodyconnection, Quantum Healing. In 2008, the heart disease pioneer Dr. Dean Ornish,working in collaboration with Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn, made abreakthrough by showing that lifestyle changes improve gene expression. One ofthe most exciting changes had to do with the production of the enzyme telomerase(see this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c005_r1.xhtml#page60] for our initialdiscussion of telomerase). To recap briefly, each strand of DNA is capped at theend, like a period ending a sentence, by a structure known as a telomere. Withage, it appears that telomeres weaken, causing the genetic sequence to fray atthe ends.It is thought, with considerable supporting research, that increased telomerase,the enzyme that builds telomeres, might significantly retard aging. TheOrnish-Blackburn study discovered that telomerase did in fact increase insubjects following the positive lifestyle program Ornish recommends.The Chopra Center study amplified these findings by looking specifically at themental and spiritual component of a changed lifestyle. The Ornish program hasseveral components, including exercise, diet, and stress management. Under thecalm and introspective conditions experienced by newly instructed meditators,telomerase began increasing the longevity of chromosomes and the cells thatenclose them.As a baseline, reduced stress during a vacation induces beneficial patterns ofhealth. For those participants who were able to carry out deep and meaningfulmeditation, however, there were more benefits beyond the vacation effect,including anti-aging, a reduced propensity for viral infections, and thesuppression of genes mobilized for injury and wound repair. It’s just asimportant to note that the effects happened quickly, within a few days. Thisaccords with other findings about how rapidly the epigenome can change.The bottom line: you can’t be on a permanent vacation all year, but you canmeditate to achieve the same and more results.The next frontier. To follow up on such an intriguing study, we next created aresearch project exploring the possibility of inducing even deeper changes. Thepower of choice, we believe, has infinite potential. We call this project theSelf-Directed Biological Transformation Initiative (SBTI). We’ve gatheredtogether a consortium of top-tier scientists and clinicians from seven leadingresearch institutions: Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital,Scripps Clinic, University of California San Diego, University of CaliforniaBerkeley, Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, and Duke University. Aparticular focus is on the health benefits of traditional Ayurvedic practices.Over at least two millennia, Ayurveda has stressed the primary importance ofbalancing body, mind, and environment to maximize the body’s rejuvenatingpowers. The SBTI employs state-of-the-art scientific methods to test forbenefits in well-being from a multifaceted Ayurvedic approach that includesdiet, yoga, meditation, and massage. Instead of studying one possible result, weare taking a “whole systems” approach.Technology has now made this possible. Our controlled trial design useswearables—mobile health sensors—and calls upon a host of specialized areas ofexpertise that are expanding explosively today: genomics, cellular and molecularbiology, metabolomics, lipidomics, microbiomics, telomerase assays, inflammatorybiomarkers, and Alzheimer’s biomarkers. We don’t need to go into detail aboutthese technologies, each of which involves extensive specialized knowledge.(Also included are personal evaluations of psychological outcomes at the ChopraCenter.)Technicalities aside, it’s enough to say that to our knowledge, this is thefirst clinical study employing a whole-systems approach to lifestyle, andAyurveda in particular. While traditional medical research is attempting todevelop and validate new drugs targeted at specific diseases, we believe that ina parallel effort, it’s only prudent to pursue the lifestyle track, for all thereasons we’ve been developing in this book. To be fully real, radical well-beingmust step up and deliver valid data, as the SBTI is currently doing.Brain changes: If you step back a little, what we’re discovering is quiteamazing—literally the ability of the mind to transform the body, and to do itquickly, with minimal struggle. The mind can even lead to the generation of newbrain cells. Beginning in the 1970s, studies had shown that something ishappening in the brain during meditation. This parallels the subjectiveexperience of feeling calmer and more relaxed. But in the last decade, theresearch has begun to show that meditation can also produce long-term structuralchanges in the brain, especially in regions associated with memory. There is anincrease in a person’s sense of self and empathy toward others, along with areduction in stress levels. Increased brain activity starts to appear insubjects who practice mindfulness meditation for only eight weeks. A team led byHarvard-affiliated researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reported theseresults in the first study to document meditation-produced changes over time inthe brain’s gray matter.What makes this finding so important is that it links how people feel when theymeditate with their physiology—the kind of proof that neuroscience demands. Theold view was that meditators reported all kinds of mental and psychologicalbenefits when in fact all they were doing in meditation was entering a state ofdeep relaxation. In the Harvard study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanswere taken of the brains of sixteen participants two weeks prior to the studyand directly afterward. MRI images of the participants were also taken after thestudy was completed. It was already known that during meditation there is anincrease in alpha waves in the brain. Alpha waves are associated with deeprelaxation. These MRIs showed something more permanent: denser gray matter(i.e., more nerve cells and connections) in specific regions like thehippocampus, which is crucial for learning and memory, as well as in other areasassociated with self-awareness, compassion, and reflection.Another study compared long-term meditators with a control group and found thatthe meditators had larger gray matter volumes than nonmeditators in areas of thehigher brain (cortex) that are associated with emotional regulation and responsecontrol. A famous study of Tibetan Buddhist monks showed activity in the area ofthe brain associated with compassion.Loss of gray matter (brain cells) and their connections is a common part ofaging. Now it appears that this loss isn’t inescapable. Some older people appearto be genetically protected from the deterioration of memory and brain cells,but in general only 10 percent of people who believe they have superior memoriesactually do, according to the standards set for a study of such “super agers.”Still, there is much to learn from these people. Finding out what makes them sounusual is a promising line of research, with the main focus being on theirbrains as compared with those of younger controls and “normal” older people.MAKING THE SCIENCE WORKThe science is undeniable, but it takes more than science to motivate people, sowe return to the core issue of compliance. We believe that success builds onsuccess. You should look for positive changes in your outer life as well asinside. The science tells us that feelings are a reliable indicator that brainchanges are actually occurring. The positive input from feeling more successfuladds something new to the feedback loop between mind and body.As yet the link to outer success, which is often reported by meditators, awaitsscientific study. You will be striking out on your own. The point is to see ifyour outer life is beginning to show improvements that only meditation canexplain. No one can really judge this besides you yourself. You may even harbora not-so-secret belief that meditation makes someone weaker, less competitive,and less motivated. Quite the opposite is true.Here’s a checklist of the changes we have in mind. Within a week or two ofbeginning to meditate, check off any of the following results you are beginningto notice.WHAT MEDITATION IS DOING FOR MY SUCCESS__ I’m making better decisions.__ I feel calmer, less anxious about making a decision.__ My work is going more easily.__ I’m in my comfort zone more.__ I have a strong sense of self.__ My focus and concentration are improving.__ My mind has fewer distracting thoughts.__ I’m not so dependent on outside approval.__ I’m coming up with better ideas.__ I have more energy at work.__ I’m enthusiastic about what I do.__ I’m more optimistic.__ I bounce back better from negative events.__ I’m getting better at reading a situation.__ Working with others is getting smoother.__ I’m having more insights.__ Problems are less discouraging, more like opportunities.__ I’m coping with stress better.__ I’m handling difficult people better.__ I feel more fit.__ I feel better put together in general.__ My mood has generally improved.Studies like the ones conducted by Ornish-Blackburn and the Chopra Centerconfirm that there’s a biological basis for these benefits. They are based onmaking one of the harder choices: meditating for 20 minutes twice a day. Buteven if you decide to make an easier choice, such as taking 5 to 10 minutes outof your lunchtime to meditate, you will start to get the benefits of relaxingand rebalancing your system.One can also rely on the testimony of thousands of meditators over the years.It’s a major shift from the Western model of hard work and struggle to succeed.We understand that, but in our view, you owe it to yourself to take advantage ofsuch an important breakthrough."},{"pageContent":"SLEEPSTILL A MYSTERY, BUT TOTALLY NECESSARYNothing has changed in decades over the standard recommendation to get a goodnight’s sleep. Medical science still hasn’t determined exactly what sleep does,but waiting for the mystery to be solved is secondary. Primary is the fact thatgoing without sleep throws your entire system out of balance. Somethingseemingly far removed from sleep, such as obesity, is actually linked quiteclosely. It’s now known that the two hormones that regulate appetite, ghrelinand leptin, are thrown out of balance by lack of sleep. When the brain isn’treceiving normal signals about hunger, you wind up overeating. Just as crucial,your brain won’t know when you’ve had enough.In our parents’ generation, getting the recommended 8 hours of sleep every nightwas easier. Americans now get an average of 6.8 hours of sleep, edging under theminimum of 7 hours that’s considered healthy. Older adults sleep less, but it’snot because they need less. Current findings indicate that a tiny clump of braincells in the hypothalamus acts as a “sleep switch,” and these cells decrease aswe age. Previously the cause of insomnia in the elderly was unknown. Now itseems that brain changes are involved, which helps to explain whyseventy-year-olds on average sleep an hour less than twenty-year-olds.Our focus, then, is on insomnia rather than sleep itself. For most people, adiagnosable sleep disorder isn’t the problem. In the tradition of Ayurveda,insomnia is rooted in an imbalance of Vata, one of the three doshas, or basicphysiological forces. Vata, which is linked to biological motion, causes allmanner of restless, irregular behavior. When it is out of balance, people findit hard to keep to a routine in diet, digestion, sleep, and work. Mood swingsand anxiety are related to Vata. Without asking anyone to adopt an Ayurvedicperspective, we think it’s helpful to see that Vata links mind and body in avery realistic way. Appetite, mood, and energy levels are all thrown out ofbalance when sleep—a natural remedy for Vata imbalance—is deprived.Here’s a chart that shows you how sleep and Vata can go out of balance together.THE VATA-SLEEP CONNECTIONBoth are thrown off by the following:Anxiety, depressionOverexertionStaying up lateCold temperatureIrregular eating, poor nutritionEmotional upsetPhysical aches and painsExcitement, agitationStressWorryGriefHarsh surroundingsExcess noiseTaking advantage of the Vata-sleep connection, you should first recommit togetting a good night’s sleep. Letting a full 8 hours turn into 5 or 6 is aslippery slope. If you have a problem with insomnia, either finding it hard tofall asleep or waking up during the night, don’t turn to pills—sleep aids ofevery sort are not the equivalent of establishing a natural sleep rhythm.Instead, our menu of choices is about setting body and mind into the rightframework for the brain’s natural sleep switch to be activated.Reading the menu: As in every section on lifestyle, the menu of choices isdivided into three parts, according to level of difficulty and proveneffectiveness.Part 1: Easy choicesPart 2: Harder choicesPart 3: Experimental choicesPlease consult this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page120] in thediet section if you need a refresher on what the three levels of choice areabout. Ordinarily we say that you should make one change per week total, not onefrom each lifestyle section. But in the case of sleep, many of the changes areso simple that it’s fine to choose several and let them overlap. Still remember,though, that whatever choices you make are meant to be permanent.SLEEP: THE MENU OF CHOICESCIRCLE TWO TO FIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE EASY TO MAKE IN YOUR CURRENT SLEEPROUTINE. THE HARDER CHOICES SHOULD FOLLOW AFTER YOU HAVE ADOPTED THE EASYCHOICES.PART 1: EASY CHOICES• Make your bedroom as dark as possible. Blackout shades are best. If totaldarkness is impossible, wear a sleep mask.• Make your bedroom as quiet as possible. If you can’t achieve perfect silence,wear earplugs. These are also advisable if early-morning noises wake you up.• Make sure your bedroom is comfortably warm and draft free.• Take a warm bath before bedtime.• Drink a glass of warm almond milk before bedtime. (It’s rich in calcium andpromotes melatonin, a hormone that helps to regulate the sleep/wake cycle.)• Meditate for 10 minutes sitting upright in bed, then slide down into yoursleeping position.• Avoid reading or watching TV half an hour before bedtime.• Take a relaxing walk before you go to sleep.• Take an aspirin an hour before bedtime to settle minor aches and pains.• No caffeinated coffee or tea three hours before bedtime.• Use the evening hours after work as a time to relax.• Meditate in the evening after you come home from work.• Find ways to unwind from stress—see our section on stress (this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c008_r1.xhtml#page145]).PART 2: HARDER CHOICES• Be regular in your sleep routine, going to bed and getting up at the same timeevery day.• Remove the TV from your bedroom. Keep the bedroom a place for sleeping.• Attend to signs of anxiety, worry, and depression.• Don’t take work home with you.• Get a massage before bedtime from your spouse or partner.• No alcohol in the evening.• Buy a more comfortable mattress.PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL CHOICES• Experiment with herbs and herbal teas traditionally associated with goodsleep: chamomile, valerian, hops, passionflower, lavender, kava kava (note thatthese are not scientifically proven remedies).• Cognitive therapy (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml#page191])• Get tested at a sleep disorder clinic.• Sesame-oil massage (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c011_r1.xhtml#page191])• Ayurvedic herbal remedies for Vata imbalance (various over-the-counterformulations are available by mail or at health food stores)EXPLAINING THE CHOICESThe Vata connection links most of the choices to conventional insomnia advice inWestern medicine. Only a few things need further explanation. To begin with, theoverlooked things that keep many people awake are too much light in the bedroom,too much noise, and minor aches and pains that escape notice until you start togo to sleep. If you have the kind of sleeplessness that’s typified by waking upin the middle of the night or too early in the morning, attend to these threefactors as first-line remedies.The tendency to lose sleep as we age has a Vata link, since according toAyurveda, this dosha increases with age. It’s prudent not to take sleep forgranted even if you have always enjoyed good, sound sleep. Adopt ourrecommendations early and you will prevent future problems. Lack of sleep hasbeen associated with triggering Alzheimer’s—see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_bm_r1.xhtml#page288] for a fascinating discussion ofthe Alzheimer’s-sleep connection, which Rudy played a major part in solving.Lack of sleep is also associated with high blood pressure, which tends toincrease by the decade as we age.Massage is very relaxing, of course, and if you have a very cooperative spouseor partner, they might be coaxed into massaging your neck and shoulders for afew moments at bedtime. Ayurveda advises Abhyanga, a specific daily massage withsesame oil, to settle Vata. It’s a simple if slightly messy procedure. Warm afew tablespoons of pure sesame oil (found in health food stores, but not thedarker kind used in Asian cooking). Sitting down with a large towel on the floorto catch drips, lightly massage the oil into arms, legs, neck, and torso.It’s not necessary to apply more than the faintest film of oil, and the besttime is in the morning after you bathe or shower. Abhyanga is considered thesovereign remedy for Vata, and in addition is a good preventive for catchingVata-related diseases like cold and flu, but it requires a good deal ofcommitment as something you intend to keep up permanently.Cognitive therapy has sometimes been effective for those who have long-standinginsomnia. In such cases there’s almost always a psychological price to pay.Lying awake in bed is unpleasant and discouraging. Insomniacs grow increasinglyfrustrated. They hate the lack of energy and blurred thinking that lack of sleepbrings with it. Cognitive therapy seeks to reverse the negative thinking thathas built up as a result of so many negative associations with sleeplessness.Check and see if you find yourself fitting the following mental patterns andbehavior.Fearing the coming night, certain that you won’t fall asleep againDisliking your bed and bedroomWorrying that you aren’t sleeping at allTossing and turning in frustrationObsessing about not getting to sleepFeeling victimizedBlaming every woe on your insomniaStaying up too late because you know you’re not going to get to sleep anywayGetting up in the middle of the night to read or watch TVThese ingrained habits of mind and behavior make insomnia worse, so it’s worthexperimenting with a few cognitive steps you can take on your own, short ofseeking help from a therapist or a sleep-disorder clinic. First comes somepositive thinking that the latest science upholds.• Most insomnia is temporary and stress related. It goes away when daily lifegets less stressful.• Insomniacs do in fact get to sleep at some time during the night, even whenthey think they haven’t.• REM (rapid-eye-movement, or deep-dreaming) sleep is a state that can bereached fairly quickly, even in a short afternoon nap.• Contrary to previous beliefs, you can catch up on sleep deficit by sleeping inlonger on the weekends.• The brain can remain alert on short sleep for a few hours. With as little as 6hours of sleep, you can be normally alert and functioning for a while beforeimpairment starts to set in.Focus on these positive thoughts in order to remove some worries about yourinsomnia. Become realistic about the actual problems it’s causing; don’t pile onnew or imaginary ones. Make it your goal to stop fixating on lack of sleep,turning your energies to solving the problem. Second, to overcome a sense ofbeing victimized, write down a list of things you are going to do to solve theproblem, and then follow through with them. Third, don’t let your spouse orpartner contribute to the problem by keeping the light on after you want to goto sleep, snoring, or moving around too much in a crowded bed. If you can’tsleep separately for whatever reason, enlist your partner in helping you solvethis problem.If you take up insomnia as a challenge rather than an affliction, your frame ofmind will change. The solutions we’ve suggested are many, and countless peoplein your position have learned how to get a good night’s sleep. There’s no reasonwhy you can’t, too.THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE CHANGESScience’s inability to explain either the mechanisms or the purpose of sleep hasbeen reduced to a medical school punch line: “the only well-established functionof sleep is to cure sleeplessness.” To date, the research on sleep has beenfocused on the brain more than on the genome. We know that brain activitychanges during sleep, and some basic discoveries, such as the need for REMsleep, emerged decades ago. It’s also becoming clear that when normal sleepdeteriorates, it is a subtle sign that other things are going on. For example,some people who suffer from severe depression report that the first sign of anoncoming attack is that they no longer sleep well. By attending immediately totheir irregular sleep, they can sometimes prevent the attack from arriving.It has also become clear that sleep rhythms differ from person to person. Insleep research terminology there are “larks” (early risers) and “owls” (laterisers) whose sleep habits are set for life. How such habits get set isn’tknown, and this may be a fruitful area for epigenetics to explore, since it’sthrough epigenetic marks that genetic predisposition intersects with experience.Disrupting someone’s natural sleep rhythm is known to have widespreadimplications for the body. Workers on the night shift, for example, never fullyadapt to their unnatural schedule of waking and sleeping. About 8.6 millionAmericans work the night shift or rotate shifts, and they are at higher risk forcardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Since the same conditions areassociated with inflammation, there could be a strong link there.Society may also be paying a price by setting the school day too early. Teacherscomplain that middle school students are in such a drowsy state early in themorning that they are essentially sleeping through first and second periods.Adolescents need more sleep than adults, between 8 and 10 hours, but one studyfound that only 15 percent of teenagers get 8½ hours or more of sleep per night.Forty percent get 6 hours or less. The typical adolescent pattern of keepingirregular hours and staying up late leads to problems that are easilypreventable. The ideal time for an adolescent to go to sleep is 11 p.m. Thisimplies that school should start later. A national debate has started amongeducators around the subject. At least one school district experimented withstarting the school day an hour later and found that test scores rosesignificantly for middle school students.Science would benefit by knowing why we actually need to sleep. Does the brainhave to rest for a while? Is it resetting itself, or perhaps going into a modein which it heals potential damage or grows new cells? Evidence points in manydirections. Freud’s theory that dreams are disguised messages about the state ofa person’s unconscious doesn’t seem to be valid, according to modern psychiatricunderstanding (there are holdouts, of course). Current belief is that dreams andthe images they produce are essentially random. But this, too, is open toconjecture. Neuroscience can hardly improve on Shakespeare’s observation afterthe guilty Macbeth cannot fall asleep. “Innocent sleep. Sleep that soothes awayall our worries. Sleep that puts each day to rest. Sleep that relieves the wearylaborer and heals hurt minds. Sleep, the main course in life’s feast, and themost nourishing.”Any full understanding of sleep must have roots in how we evolved, however. Thatmuch is certain; therefore, genes are crucial in some way as yet unknown. Deepakcoauthored an article on sleep with an academic expert, Dr. Murali Doraiswamy,professor of psychiatry at Duke University. Because the genetic links betweenhuman and animal sleep are fascinating, we thought we’d give you some of thebasic insights, even though they don’t apply in any practical way to how you aresleeping.Their article notes that babies spend most of their days sleeping, but why? Whydo creative solutions sometimes arrive in our sleep or soon after waking? (“Aproblem difficult at night is often solved in the morning after the committee ofsleep has worked on it.”—John Steinbeck) Do plants go through rest cycles thatare the equivalent of sleep?Such puzzles have been made more topical by a recent study in mice that showedthat one of the roles of sleep may be to clear out the accumulated garbage fromthe brain. If this is the only explanation, however, then why do we need tospend one-third of our day unconscious—couldn’t evolution have developed asystem to clear out trash while we are awake (much like urination ordefecation)?Let’s take a look at some facts that may help us grapple with sleep’s mysteryand its insights. Sleep is a state in which the organism’s consciousness isreduced or absent, and it loses the ability to use all nonessential muscles (indeep sleep you are essentially paralyzed and cannot move your limbs). From birthto old age there are dramatic changes in the amount of time humans spend invarious sleep stages as well as in overall sleep. Babies sleep for 15 or morehours, which then steadily decreases to 10 to 11 hours for children andadolescents, 8 hours for adults, and 6 hours for the elderly (even though theyneed the same 8 hours as when they were younger).The amount of time spent in REM versus non-REM sleep also decreases throughlife. Premature babies spend almost all their sleep (some 75 percent) in REMsleep, whereas full-term babies typically spend about 8 hours nightly in REM,which drops to about 1 to 2 hours nightly in adults. During REM sleep the brainshows high activity (gamma waves) and high blood flow, sometimes even more thanwhile awake, and scientists believe this is when the brain rehearses andconsolidates actions and memories. One can only wonder what a newborn baby, whospends 8 hours in REM sleep, is dreaming about since it has had so little wakingexperience.Most animal species studied appear to sleep. Many primates, such as monkeys,sleep as much as we do, about 10 hours. Dolphins and some other marine creaturescan sleep with half their brain awake (unihemispherical sleep) to protectthemselves from predators—total sleep of both sides of the brain may lead todrowning. There is still debate about whether or not migrating birds may be ableto sleep even while flying (with one eye open, much the way humans can take acatnap while standing up). For whatever reason, at least in captivity,carnivores (such as lions) need more sleep than herbivores (such as elephantsand cows)—we don’t know if the same applies also to meat-eating versus veganhumans!All of this interesting stuff illustrates how sleep is programmed into our genesand behaviors. But sleep would seem to be a poor survival trait as far asevolution goes. Because sleep put our ancestors (and other living creatures) atrisk from predators, the benefits must outweigh the risks—that’s all thatscientists can manage to agree on. Unlike humans, some animals (e.g., newborndolphins) can survive sleep deprivation for a couple of weeks without apparentharm. However, in most species, after extended sleep deprivation, their bodytemperature and metabolism become unstable and they die. The longest period ahuman has survived sleep deprivation is believed to be about two weeks, but manyphysical and mental deficits occur long before that; driving ability issignificantly impaired after one night’s bad sleep.Finally, sleep is related to mood—strangely enough, sleep deprivation can makepeople happy and sometimes manic. Decades ago doctors took advantage of thisfact in trying to treat depression (a misguided strategy, now that we recognizethe link between depression and bad sleep). Numerous creative breakthroughs havebeen attributed to dreams, such as the tune for the Beatles song “Yesterday”(Paul McCartney), the structure of carbon and benzene (August Kekulé), and thesewing machine (Elias Howe). Indeed, the discovery of acetylcholine, a chemicalthat regulates many aspects of dream sleep, reportedly came to Otto Loewi indreams on two consecutive nights in 1921. On the first night, he woke up andscribbled down some notes in his diary that, alas, he couldn’t read in themorning. On the second night, he was lucky enough to write them more legibly.Loewi’s subsequent experiment based on his dreams won him a Nobel Prize. EvenRudy had dreams that helped him find one of the Alzheimer’s genes based onhistorical photographs adorning the walls of Massachusetts General Hospital nearhis lab.Common experience tells us to agree with Shakespeare’s simple conclusion thatsleep “knits up the raveled sleeve of care.” Without a fuller understanding ofconsciousness itself, however, all arguments are adrift in the same darkness weinhabit every time we fall asleep.MAKING THE SCIENCE REALWhen it comes to applying the science of sleep, at this point you may say, “Whatscience?” But there are certainly enough data on sleep deprivation to underscorethe need for a good night’s sleep at all ages, with deleterious consequences ifyou don’t get the proper sleep. Don’t fool yourself into believing that you havetrained yourself to do well on less than 7 hours of sleep a night—only afraction of the adult population falls into this category.And the genetic connection? We know that the daily, or circadian, rhythm ofsleep is maintained by “clock” genes that operate by sophisticated feedbackloops. An entire network of these clock genes displays rhythmic activity,although once again, how this activity occurs is unknown. Certain variants inclock genes have been associated with whether you are a morning or an eveningperson. Attempts to link sleep disturbances with neuropsychiatric disorders haveled so far to the identification of gene mutations in clock genes that areassociated with rare sleep disorders.Epigenetics has also been shown to regulate our circadian rhythms and may infact be closely linked to sleep disorders. Since disruptions of sleep rhythmshave been linked to numerous disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, obesity,heart disease, cancers, and autoimmune diseases, we must further explore theepigenetic link to sleep regulation.Progress is being made. A specific clock gene called CLK serves as masterregulator of our sleep cycle by epigenetically switching other circadian rhythm(sleep cycle) genes on and off. The fact is that hundreds of genes follow atwenty-four-hour cycle of variable activity, and many of these genes affect yoursleep cycle and thus your health. Since epigenetics has already been shown tomodify the activities of these sleep cycle genes, it follows that a variety oflifestyle changes that affect our epigenetics most likely influence our sleepcycle.It will be very important to understand which lifestyle activities, experiences,and exposures allow us to sleep regularly or cause sleep deprivation. At thevery least, stress must be involved in sleep deprivation. We’ve previouslydiscussed how stress is a major contributor to epigenetic changes leading todisease. But here we run into a chicken-and-egg question, because sleepdeprivation leads to stress and vice versa. More epigenetic findings are inorder.Our recommendations about curing insomnia are also useful if you already enjoynormal sleep, because they can improve its quality. The brain’s sleep switch isgeared to two activities that are the opposite of each other: arousal andrelaxation. Arousal keeps us awake, and it wakes us up if we’re asleep. If aloud bang in the middle of the night wakes you up, that’s an example of arousal;so is bright light striking your eyes or a dripping faucet.These external triggers can be managed with a little effort, but there’s thesubtle problem of internal arousal, which is more difficult to manage. Whenworry keeps you awake at night, that’s an example of internal arousal—the brainrefuses to relax, let go, and stop thinking. Some internal triggers arephysical, such as when pain wakes you up in the middle of the night, or the needto empty your bladder. We think that the Vata connection is useful here, becauseAyurveda takes for granted that body and mind work together, which is certainlytrue when it comes to sleep.In Western terms, arousal triggers send too many signals to the brain’s feedbackloop. Worry, anxiety, and depression are self-perpetuating. Unless a way isfound to break their repetitiveness, the same thoughts return obsessively, whichinterrupts the signal that the brain should be heeding, the signal to go tosleep. The Ayurvedic advice to avoid overstimulating your mind before bedtime issound advice for our physiology. Stimulus leads to arousal. It’s easy enough tomake your evenings more relaxing under normal circumstances, but anxiety anddepression pose their own special difficulties. This is especially true whensomeone has become so habituated to worry or negative thinking in general thatthe brain’s sleep switch has become sidelined, as it were.The opposite of arousal is relaxation, an activity that modern people reservefor the fringe of their day. They relax when there’s time left over from workinstead of making it a primary activity. What’s needed is a new model of how ahigh-functioning brain should operate. What can be done to counter the tendencyto seek more and more stimulation while drastically depriving ourselves ofrelaxation?The most credible version of the fully integrated brain is the one laid out by aHarvard-trained psychiatrist and neuroscientist, Dr. Daniel J. Siegel, now atthe UCLA School of Medicine, who has made a career of examining the neurobiologyof human moods and mental states. In our book Super Brain we enthusiasticallyendorsed Siegel’s basic insight that the brain needs a whole “menu” ofactivities during the day. Please see that discussion for a full discussion ofthis topic. Here we want to highlight three choices on the menu that too manypeople are deprived of: “in” time, downtime, and playtime.We alluded to spending “in time” every day in the section on meditation. As thename says, this is time you spend going inside and experiencing the mind at itscalmest and most peaceful, but also its deepest. “Downtime” is spent notthinking about work and duty, simply “vegging out” for a while. Lying on yourback in the grass staring at the clouds is the ideal kind of downtime.“Playtime” needs no explanation, but how many of us take a few moments to beplayful, to laugh and have fun, every day? Siegel’s research indicates thatadding these overlooked brain activities has enormous curative effects when apatient seeks psychotherapy. Their brains aren’t fully functioning because ofthe lack of certain activities that are totally necessary for a complete andfulfilling life, including normal moods and emotions.It’s only a matter of time before overstimulation is connected with epigeneticchanges and inflammation. Rather than waiting for science to catch up, look atyour daily life. If you are exhausted by the end of the day, if you are runragged with no time to relax, if you don’t laugh or feel the enjoyment of simplybeing here, these are signals that you should pay attention to. Sleep holds itsmysteries, but the benefits of relaxation and the risks of overstimulation arequite clear. As you tip the balance away from arousal, your brain will return toa natural state of balance, and the results can’t help but improve your sleep."},{"pageContent":"EMOTIONSHOW TO FIND DEEPER FULFILLMENTEmotions are a vast subject, but there’s one statement that holds true foreveryone. The most desirable emotional state is happiness. Even though happinessis a mental state, the body is deeply affected by our moods. Chemical messagestell every cell how you feel. In its own way a cell can be happy or sad,agitated or content, joyous or despairing. The super genome amply confirms thisfact. If your stomach has ever tightened from fear, the “gut brain” iseavesdropping on your emotion, and when depression afflicts several generationsin a family, epigenetic marks may be playing a key role. Most polls find thataround 80 percent of people describe themselves as happy, and yet other researchindicates that at best around 30 percent of people are actually thriving, whilerates of depression, anxiety, and stress continue to rise.It is highly unlikely that a “happiness gene” will ever be discovered. The newgenetics tells us that in complex diseases like cancer hundreds of separategenetic mutations are likely involved. Emotions are much more complex than anydisease. But we don’t need to discover the happiness gene. Instead, we shouldgive as much positive input to the super genome as possible, trusting it toproduce positive output. Science may take decades to correlate the complex geneactivity that produces happiness; in the meantime, the super genome connects allthe input that life brings us.Let’s contrast the kind of input that promotes beneficial gene activity with thekind that creates damage. Both lists contain items you are quite familiar withby now, but it’s good to see everything gathered together.POSITIVE INPUT TO THE SUPER GENOME12 THINGS THAT REINFORCE HAPPINESSMeditationLove and affectionSatisfying workCreative outletsHobbiesSuccessBeing appreciatedBeing of serviceHealthy food, water, and airSetting long-range goalsPhysical fitnessRegular routine free of stressIt’s hard to imagine that someone whose life contains these things on a dailybasis wouldn’t be happy. By the same token, the things that the super genomereads as negative must be avoided.NEGATIVE INPUT TO THE SUPER GENOME14 THINGS THAT DAMAGE HAPPINESSStressToxic relationshipsBoring, unsatisfying workBeing ignored and taken for grantedConstant distractions during the daySedentary habitsNegative beliefs, pessimismAlcohol, tobacco, and drugsEating when you’re already fullProcessed foods and fast foodPhysical illness, especially if painfulAnxiety and worryDepressionUnhappy friendsThe two sides of human experience constantly vie for our attention, and it mustbe admitted that for most people, the scars of negative experience are hard toheal. Adding positive input certainly helps—if you were unloved as a child,being loved as an adult makes a huge difference. But happiness will never bebioengineered. Until we reach Part III, on consciousness and the genome, themystery of emotions will remain a mystery. The lifestyle choices we offer areall worthwhile. Make no mistake about that. But the trail of clues leadsfarther.Reading the menu: As in every section on lifestyle, the menu of choices isdivided into three parts, according to level of difficulty and proveneffectiveness.Part 1: Easy choicesPart 2: Harder choicesPart 3: Experimental choicesPlease consult this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#page120] in thediet section if you need a refresher on what the three levels of choice areabout. You should make one change per week total, not one from each lifestylesection. Remember that whatever choices you make are meant to be permanent.EMOTIONS: THE MENU OF CHOICESCIRCLE TWO TO FIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE EASY TO MAKE IN YOUR CURRENT LIFESTYLEIN REGARD TO EMOTIONS. THE HARDER CHOICES SHOULD FOLLOW AFTER YOU HAVE ADOPTEDTHE EASY CHOICES.PART 1: EASY CHOICES• Write down five specific things that make you happy. On a daily basis,consciously do one of them.• Express gratitude for one thing a day.• Express appreciation for one person every day.• Spend more time with people who are happy and less time with people whoaren’t.• Set a “good news only” policy at mealtimes.• As you go to sleep at night, take a moment to mentally review the good thingsthat happened that day.• Fix a weekly date night with your spouse or partner.• Do one thing a week that brings someone else a moment of happiness.• Make leisure time creative; go beyond watching TV and surfing the Internet.PART 2: HARDER CHOICES• Set a worthy long-range goal and pursue it. Best is a lifelong goal (see thispage [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page207]).• Find something to be passionate about.• Cut back on exposure to bad news in the media—make do with one news program orreading one story online.• Use the positive and negative input charts (this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page202]) every day.• Whenever a situation makes you unhappy, walk away as soon as you practicallycan.• Don’t unload your negativity on others; seek sympathy and compassion instead.• Do one thing a day that brings someone else a moment of happiness.• Learn to deal with negativity after you calm down, not in the heated oranxious moment.PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL CHOICES• Write down your personal vision of a higher life.• Find one self-defeating habit and write down a plan to overcome it.• Explore the time in your past when you were happiest and learn from it.• Set out to improve your emotional intelligence (see this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page214]).EXPLAINING THE CHOICESWell-being depends upon happiness, yet most people don’t really make thisconnection. Instead they allow their emotional state to drift. Deepak wasrecently consulted by a woman in her late fifties who insisted that she led alifestyle carefully groomed to eliminate the wrong food. She exercisedregularly, and she was a high achiever who owned her own business and loved thework she did. So why was she afflicted with aches and pains, along with chronicinsomnia, exhaustion, and a faintly depressed mood all the time?It took half an hour to itemize all the particulars of her lifestyle, and thenDeepak asked a simple question, which revolved around the woman’s insomnia. Itwas obvious that getting only six hours of sleep at night was causing almost allof her problems.“What have you done to make your sleep better?” he asked.“Nothing, really,” she replied. The woman had already revealed that her husbandsnored, the dog greeted dawn by jumping on the bed, and the slightest noiseoutside woke her up. Deepak pointed out some simple remedies, but she was barelylistening.“Wait a second,” Deepak said. “Do you think it’s important to take care ofyourself?”She hung her head. “I know I’m not good about that.”“But you’re meticulous about so many things, like your diet.”She looked even guiltier. “I do that for my family. Without me, they’d eatanything.”Now the picture was clear. She was a person who burdened herself with everyone’swell-being but her own. Self-sacrifice was woven into her personal idea ofhappiness. The problem was that she had carried it too far. She forgot herselfalong the way and would carry any amount of stress because this fit herconception of being a good wife and mother.The solution in the short run was to get her to do something about her insomnia.The solution in the long term was harder, though. She had to retrain herself tobelieve that her own happiness mattered. She had allowed her emotional state todrift, and therefore she wasn’t really connected to any real state ofwell-being. Her good marriage and high achievement were being undermined, and sowere the positive lifestyle practices she attended to so carefully.All of us put up with significant pain in our lives without trying to makechanges. That’s why our easy choices are about turning your attention to whatmakes you happy, and actually thinking about specifics every day. You need toexperience what it’s like to appreciate another person, for example.Appreciation, like love, isn’t theoretical. The actual feeling must register inthe brain, and once it does, the mind-body feedback loop has something real toprocess.When you take a moment at night to revisit the good things that happened to youduring the day, you reinforce every positive experience. By consciouslyreminding yourself, you retrain your brain. A kind of filtering process istaking place. You select only the things you wish to reinforce, filtering outthe mundane, irrelevant, and negative things. Once this becomes a habit, youwill begin to experience a real shift in your personal reality. It will amazeyou how much has been overlooked or taken for granted. Life isn’t good byitself; you must respond to it as good.In the harder choices, we ask you to go deeper into what makes you happy on theinside. We all receive a barrage of media trying to convince us that consumerismleads to happiness, but very little messaging that points in the rightdirection, toward happiness as an inner state. This is another reason for makingconscious choices—no one will do it for you. Only you can wean yourself off thetwenty-four-hour news cycle, which inundates us with negativity. Only you canfind something to be passionate about.Unconsciously, you’ve cluttered your mind with years and years of experiencesthat deposit memories of tragedy, disaster, disappointment, and frustration. Inthe Vedic tradition (India’s ancient wisdom tradition) these memories reside inChit Akasha (literally, “mind space”), and it’s in your Chit (consciousness)where you build a self. There is no separate compartment for thoughts, memories,and experiences that are objective, impersonal, and therefore selfless. Like asand dune gathering a billion grains of sand, the winds of your life havedeposited particles of experience in Chit Akasha, where they’ve become part ofyou. A sand dune has no choice but to be a passive collector of any debris thatblows its way, but you can choose not to expose yourself to experiences thatconstitute negative input—refer back to the chart on this page[Chop_9780804140140_epub3_c012_r1.xhtml#page202].Worthy goals: On a day-to-day basis, the most valuable choice on the menu isprobably the recommendation to consult the lists of positive and negativeinputs. Reminding yourself to maximize the positive and minimize the negativegoes a long way. Yet we place a great deal of importance on being happy forlife, and that depends more than anything on setting a worthy goal that can befulfilled over a long time span. Momentary pleasure doesn’t have nearly theimpact of a goal that you spend years to achieve, with every step adding moremeaning and purpose to your existence.What is your worthy goal going to be? This is a unique and important decision.For some people, raising a child toward a fulfilled adulthood is deeplysatisfying, or developing a passion for charitable works. There are goals aslofty as reaching higher states of consciousness or as practical as building afamily-owned business. You don’t have to decide once and for all. Your goal canand should evolve. The key to finding a goal that will sustain you for a longtime is to be self-aware. Lasting happiness is tied to knowing who you are andwhat you are here to do.No one is capable of being all things. In India, the one pursuit that will allowyou to thrive in your life is known as Dharma. Dharma comes from a root wordthat means “to uphold.” If you are in your Dharma, the universe will uphold you,so it is believed. But each of us must test this theory out for ourselves.Modern people are fortunate to have the freedom to find their own Dharma; in theIndian tradition, the choice was basically limited to the work your father andmother did. But the principle remains the same: seek inner fulfillment and thepath will be smoothed. The opposite is to put so little value on our happinessthat you settle for lack of fulfillment. No one who settles can expect life tobring them much support; dissatisfaction only magnetizes more dissatisfaction toitself.Dharma can be broken down into smaller compartments. Let’s do that now. Thinkabout your worthy goal. For Deepak, it is service—call this an umbrella term, asingle word or phrase that embraces many smaller, specific things, such asgiving freely of your time, thinking of what others need, sympathizing withsomeone else’s problems, acting unselfishly, and so on. Rudy’s umbrella term ispositive transformation—with the goal of leaving this planet a healthier andhappier place than when he entered it. You can pick your own umbrella term.Among the possibilities that may inspire you are the following:Love and compassion for allBringing peace and reducing violenceImproving education to decrease ignorance and lack of knowledgePursuing creativityProtecting the weak and dispossessedPromoting culture and traditionExploration and discovery in an area rich for those thingsBeing of service without judgment against anyoneMost people can find a worthy goal within these categories. Choose a goalwithout worrying that it must be permanent. Sit quietly and center yourself.Take a deep breath, exhale. Another deep breath, exhale. Now a third breath,exhale.In your calm, centered state, think about the goal you want to achieve. Let’ssay that you want to be of service. Ask yourself the following questions:Am I already living my goal, even if it only occupies part of my time?Is this activity really enjoyable to me?Does it come easily and naturally?Does it energize me rather than take away my energy?Does it make me feel more like the person I want to be?Am I in the right situation to keep pursuing my goal?Do I have a sense that this activity is allowing me to grow?These seven questions are critical for finding your avenue of greatesthappiness, your Dharma. When you can answer yes to them, you are perfectly inyour avenue of success. There are other things to learn and more skills toperfect, but you have done something invaluable: You have made success a livingreality, an activity that will allow you to thrive today and tomorrow, not somedistant day in the future.THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE CHANGESThe new genetics comes at an opportune time, because from a psychologicalviewpoint, happiness is at a crossroads. As a science, psychology and psychiatryhave spent most of their history trying to heal mental disturbances; in otherwords, curing unhappiness. By now, though, most people have heard about thefield of positive psychology, a name that sounds quite optimistic. In reality,some of the most publicized findings in positive psychology are pessimistic.They include the following:• People are bad predictors of what will make them really happy. After gettingmore money, a bigger house, a new spouse, or a better job, they aren’t nearly ashappy as they wanted to be.• Happiness tends to be accidental and short term. An experience falls out ofthe sky that makes us happy for a while, only to vanish or feel stale andboring.• Permanent happiness is a fantasy. If you are very fortunate and almosteverything goes your way in life, you may achieve a kind of steady-statecontentment, but it will fall short of being happy all the time.• There is a set point for happiness inside each of us that we can change onlytemporarily. After any strong experience, whether positive or negative, wereturn within six months to our set point, and attempts to change it will mostlikely prove futile.These are discouraging conclusions, but fortunately they are all provisional.Human nature is too complex to be reduced to a few hard-and-fast principles. Thesaving grace of positive psychology is that it sets happiness as a normal goalthat we can train ourselves to reach. Despite your emotional set point, whichreturns you to your normal state of happiness or unhappiness, it’s estimatedthat 40 percent of a person’s happiness depends on the choices he or she makes.We believe this number is too low, because it doesn’t take into account the newunderstanding of epigenetics and how experience gets marked down in our genes,not to mention how the epigenomes of our parents and grandparents affect us.Even less understood is how the microbiome is related to happiness, but at leastwe know that the “gut brain” is constantly sending an enormous amount of inputto the brain itself.We’ve described how stress can lead to epigenetic modifications that aredetrimental. Fear can also cause epigenetic modifications to the genome. Anintense fear reaction, sometimes paralyzing, takes place when someone has aphobia. Whatever induces the state of panic—spiders, heights, open spaces, thenumber thirteen—isn’t germane. It’s the brain’s response that creates thephobia. Recent studies suggest that the phobic response can be addressed at thelevel of gene activities. Researchers in Australia have identified whichmammalian genes are modified when someone feels overwhelmed with fear. As withcomplex diseases like cancer, the picture is complex. In rats, nearly threedozen separate genes undergo epigenetic modifications in response toanxiety-provoking conditions. As a result of these studies and others like them,we now have a good idea of the genes that control the fear response in humans.Can these same genes be therapeutically targeted to alleviate phobias? Thefuture will tell.On the other side of the coin, positive emotions, especially love, can alsochange gene activity. In the animal kingdom, many species mate for life,including wolves, French angelfish, bald eagles, and even parasitic gut worms.One such creature is the tiny prairie vole. But when researchers investigated itclosely, they were surprised to find that when prairie voles mate, geneactivities change to trigger monogamous behavior.In species that favor monogamous behavior, including our own, couples are likelyto build homes together and share parental responsibilities. A specificneurochemical, oxytocin (popularly called the “love hormone”), has beenassociated with bringing on monogamy. As it turns out, when prairie voles mate,they turn up the activity of the gene that makes a protein in the brain thatinserts itself into the surface of the nerve cell and serves a receptor foroxytocin. Such receptors bind with neurochemicals so that they can elicit theireffect on the cell. In other words, even when oxytocin isn’t increased or lessis available, it is more likely to have an effect on nerve cell circuits nowthat more receptors exist to bind with it.The act of prairie vole mating accomplishes such changes by altering geneactivity. Further studies have shown that epigenetics are at play in maleprairie vole behavior. In these studies, genes for the oxytocin receptor, aswell as the genes for the receptor for another neurochemical called vasopressin,were turned on to make more receptors. Vasopressin is known to make male volesspend more time with their mates and more aggressively protect them from othermales. However, when the same genes were artificially turned up with drugs, thevoles didn’t undergo these genetic changes or become monogamous. The desiredresults could be obtained artificially only if the males and females wereallowed to spend six hours together in the same cage before the drug was given.The implications of this study are profound—instead of seeing brain chemistry asa one-way street, with a hormone like oxytocin dictating behavior, it turns outthat brain chemistry needs the right kind of behavior in place as well.Animals bond while human beings love. Different as those behaviors areemotionally, is the epigenome playing a critical role in both? In prairie voles,the oxytocin receptor gene was turned up by removing methyl marks from the gene.This leads to the desire for monogamy, and endocrinologists link it to feelingsof love between a human mother and her newborn baby. In stark contrast, oxytocinreceptor genes with too many methyl marks, which turn them off, is associated inhuman beings with autism. (In addition, specific mutations in the oxytocinreceptor gene have also been associated with autism.) All in all, epigeneticshas a profound effect on the oxytocin receptor, and if the prairie vole offersclues to human behavior, oxytocin helps us to become monogamous.Clearly lifetime coupling can’t be genetically induced by the act of making lovein humans. But is there a bond at the genetic level? Perhaps it requires firstgetting to know each other, as with the voles. Many neuroscientists alreadyaccept that oxytocin and vasopressin are necessary for people to bond with amate and feel love. Certain neurochemicals stimulate areas in the brain used forgetting pleasure as a reward, which creates a desire for more reward. Thismechanism is involved in the action of cocaine, which stimulates dopaminereceptors, potentially leading to a cocaine addiction.There are people who describe themselves as being addicted to love. Besides thedirect chemical effect of oxytocin, as pleasurable feelings are recalled anddesired through the oxytocin reward center, love can indeed become an addiction.But pleasure, in all its forms, can’t be equated with happiness. If you put foodin front of a hungry animal, it will eat, and brain scans will show that thepleasure center in the animal’s brain has been activated. In a human being,emotional responses complicate the issue. When cranky two-year-olds refuse toeat, they can be very obstinate about it. In restaurants some people areextremely picky about what they choose from the menu, and depending on our mood,we can refuse food out of grief, distraction, anger, worry, and frustration.Human reactions depend on chemical messages, but there are so many of these thatno one has found a simple chemical formula for happiness. We are the onlycreatures who respond to stimulus X with any response you can imagine. Brainchemicals serve the mind, not the other way around.MAKING THE SCIENCE REALHappiness is a very new branch of genetic research, and there are ethicalreasons why human subjects can’t be subjected to extreme emotional states. Ourmenu of choices is based on the best science available. Bringing positive inputinto our life is a major step and, fortunately, your mood is very likely to beimproved when you address all the other lifestyle choices. Indeed, if alifestyle change doesn’t make you feel happier, it won’t stick around for long.But we are brought back to the mystery of emotions and the fact that unlikeanimals, merely feeling pleasure isn’t enough to make us happy. What is enough?Twenty years ago there was a fad for a newly discovered kind of intelligence,measured not by IQ (Intelligence Quotient) but by EQ, for Emotional Quotient.The key finding was that a person’s IQ is separate from their ability to handleemotions intelligently. Although some best sellers emerged that urged theimportance of emotional intelligence, there’s no accepted standard for this. Themost commonly accepted test for emotional intelligence, given to 111 businessleaders, didn’t correlate at all with how their employees saw them. Thus thelink between EQ and superior leadership ability—or superiority in any field—isup in the air.We think a stronger argument can be made for emotional intelligence andhappiness. Consider the following desirable emotional traits:SEVEN HABITS OF HIGH-EQ PEOPLE1. They have good impulse control.2. They are comfortable with delayed gratification.3. They can see how someone else feels.4. They are open to their own emotions.5. They know how emotions work and where each one leads to.6. They successfully feel their way through life instead of thinking their waythough.7. They meet their needs by linking with someone who can actually fulfill them.All of these traits would allow you to process your experience in a happier way,and it’s the processing that counts. You can process any event—a new baby,winning the lottery, moving to a new house—as a source of happiness orunhappiness. Human emotions don’t follow rules, which is why we are bothcreative and unpredictable. But within each person, there must be a way tocomfortably relate to how you feel. To us, that’s the great benefit of emotionalintelligence.Let’s see how each desirable trait might apply in your own life.1. IMPULSE CONTROLConsumerism would collapse overnight if people didn’t act on impulse. Unthinkingchoices lead us to stop off at McDonald’s instead of eating a home-cooked mealthat we know in advance will be more satisfying and healthy. On impulse we eat,drink, and spend too much. Like anything else you train your brain to dorepeatedly, impulsiveness becomes a habit, and once entrenched, it’s very hardto supplant.The root of impulsive behavior is lack of control. Most impulsive lapses areharmless, because we all like to lose control once in a while. But beyond that,losing control means that your impulses control you. Past lessons are neverreally learned if you can’t apply them the next time you have an irresistibleurge. People with high EQs are the opposite. They learn from the past, and theprimary thing they learn is that impulsive behavior is mostly self-defeating.This is a lesson they actually feel. Their memories don’t go blank when it comesto how bad a hangover feels, or being overstuffed after a meal, or finding outthat a time-share was a worthless purchase. In fact, having an emotional memory,which most people avoid, is something they are proud of. The memory bank ofimpulsive people is filled with terrible decisions they prefer to forget; thememory bank of people with a high EQ is filled with good choices that reinforcethe next good choice.What to do: Delay your impulsive action by waiting five minutes. If you stillfeel impulsive, take a piece of paper and write down the pros and cons of yourimpulse. Be sure to include how it felt the morning after you indulged in yourlast impulsive behavior.2. DELAYED GRATIFICATIONOlder people are often heard decrying that the young want instant gratification,but the key is to know which pleasures should be delayed and which can beenjoyed right now. It’s gratifying to move out of your parents’ house, get yourown place, and support yourself. Going to law school or medical school delaysthis gratification for years and burdens you with considerable debt on top ofeverything. Society makes it easier to make such a choice because it holds outthe promise of prestige and higher income after you graduate.As we alluded to before, it’s largely the small choices where people find ithard to deny instant gratification. That’s why we find ourselvesEating between mealsOverindulging in alcoholic beveragesSnacking while we watch TVSitting at home instead of getting some exerciseStopping off for fast foodLoading up on sugarSpending hours online instead of relating to real peopleBlurting out things we later regretGoing on bad dates instead of waiting for someone better to come alongAs with impulse control, which is closely related, people with a high EQ don’tseize on instant gratification. They aren’t motivated by an intellectual notionthat this is good for them, or not entirely. They feel better when they postponetheir pleasure under the right circumstances. They are flexible enough to laydown no hard-and-fast rules. Being flexible comes with a high EQ. When facedwith a momentary temptation, they don’t say, “I’ll give in just this once. Whatcan it hurt?” which is naked rationalization. Instead they say to themselves,“Is this really the best I can do? Let’s wait and see.”What to do: Take a good look at your life and ask if you have been makingproblems by seeking instant gratification. Do you waste money on pointlesspurchases? Is your closet crammed with too many clothes? Is impulsive spendinglowering your bank account? Is your freezer full of food you never get to?If you see a problem, address it one activity at a time. When you are beingtempted by a new pair of shoes, for example, or an extravagant purchase like afull-scale home gym that will soon be gathering dust, write down somethingfurther off that would bring you even more pleasure. Instead of the shoes, youcan save for a vacation. Instead of the expensive gym, you can learn to playtennis and use public courts. Until the delayed gratification is brought tomind, it can’t compete with instant gratification.3. THE ABILITY TO EMPATHIZEIt comes naturally to see how someone else feels. We’ve all had this abilitysince infancy, when our feelings depended heavily—sometimes solely—on how ourmothers felt. Families are the schoolhouse for everyone’s emotional education,and of course some children are much more fortunate than others. They don’tlearn bad habits that must later be unlearned. If you can’t easily see howsomeone else feels and know why, somewhere along the way you blocked an abilityyou were born with. Either you had a teacher, like a closed-off father, whomotivated you in the wrong direction, or you made up your own mind that emotionsaren’t a positive aspect of life. In any case, you no longer empathize.People with a high EQ do. It gives good doctors a naturally comforting bedsidemanner. It makes people come around to a sales pitch, because they feel thattheir needs are being understood. At some level none of us can be fooled byinsincerity and hypocrisy; we have extremely sensitive emotional gauges. With ahigh EQ, you find it easy to read someone else, looking beyond their words tohow they actually feel.What to do: To empathize with someone else, you have to want to. With people welove, this is easy—when our children hurt, we hurt. Extending this response tosomeone we like is also fairly easy. Knowing that you have the seed of empathyinside, you can choose to let it flourish. Listen to a stranger or a coworker asif they were friends. Notice how well they respond, then check your ownresponse. If extending sympathy doesn’t feel good, there is resistance somewhereinside you. Perhaps you feel that other people’s problems impose a burden ofresponsibility on you. You might feel compelled to help or to worry about them.Emotional intelligence is about coming to terms with these obstacles and turningthem into virtues. It’s good to help others, but you don’t have to helpeverybody. It’s empathic to listen to another person’s story, but not over andover. Once you start to make these distinctions, you’ll find that empathy is awonderful gift, not something to shun or be anxious about. There’s a happymedium between the extremes of being too soft hearted and too hard hearted. Setout to find the balance that works for you.4. EMOTIONAL SELF-ACCEPTANCEBeing completely open to our own emotions is rare. Inside everyone is a desireto be seen in the best light, so we avoid exposing negative emotions, even toourselves. But there is another force inside that counters this desire, a voicethat reminds us of our guilt, shame, and bad deeds. Constantly telling yourselfhow good you are is just as far from reality as constantly telling yourself howbad you are. People with a high EQ have confronted the best and worst aboutthemselves. As a result, they find self-acceptance at a much deeper level thanmost people.Because we are so defensive about the parts of ourselves that provoke guilt andshame, finding self-acceptance isn’t easy or instantaneous. “Love yourself” isthe goal, not the first step. Even to say “I am worthy of love” can be quitedifficult for some people. They don’t have a foundation as well-loved children,which is how we adopt our ingrained sense of self. It’s helpful to realize twotruths. First, having an emotion you don’t like isn’t the same as acting on thatemotion. Nonetheless, guilt and shame don’t see any difference. They want topunish you just for having a thought. In reality, thoughts come and go; they aretransient visitors, not aspects of your core self.Second, you are not the same person that you were in the past. Guilt and shamedon’t believe this—they constantly reinforce the message that you haven’tchanged and will never change. In reality, you are constantly changing. The realissue is whether you want to reinforce who you are today or who you once were.People with high EQ find vitality in being themselves here and now. They don’thaul in withered selves from the past.What to do: Anytime you have a guilty or shameful thought from the past, stopand say to yourself, “I am not that person anymore.” If the feeling returns, saythe words again. Sometimes such recurrent thoughts are very stubborn. In thatcase, as soon as you can find a moment alone, sit with eyes closed, take a fewdeep breaths, and center yourself. We aren’t minimizing that wounds from thepast can have a powerful influence over the present. The key is to realize thefalseness of applying old hurts to new situations. With this conviction in mind,you can move toward self-acceptance day by day. Entering fully into the presentmoment is the best way to find self-acceptance, and vice versa. The more youaccept yourself, the richer the present moment will become. Make this truth workto your advantage.5. EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCESAll actions have consequences, including emotions. As far as your brain isconcerned, generating the neurochemicals that give you the feelings of anger,joy, fear, confidence, or any other feeling, is an action. Your whole bodyreacts to these chemical messages; therefore emotions can’t be seen as passive.Even a stoic who bottles up every unwanted emotion is doing something active. Inthis book we have been focusing on system-wide choices that bring benefits tomind and body together, using the super genome as their vehicle.Once you know that negative emotions are harmful to you, your viewpoint changes.It’s no longer a free ride to attack someone else, feel envy, act out of spite,and fantasize about revenge. Each of these emotions rebounds on you, right downto your genes. True well-being isn’t possible when negativity is undermining it.People with a high EQ have come to terms with this truth, even if they don’tknow about epigenetic modifications. Other people have certainly experienced howa parent’s anger or worry caused their children to suffer. On that basis alone,you can grasp that emotions always have consequences.What to do: You can’t stop our negative feelings from having an effect, both onyou and on your surroundings. When this fact sinks in, taking responsibility foryour emotions is the most important step. There is no longer a valid reason tovent your anger at others, to make them afraid of you, to intimidate, bully, ordominate out of selfish motives.No one is asking you to become saintly. Knowing that emotions have consequencesis meant to benefit you. Open your eyes and watch how someone’s anger or anxietychanges the atmosphere for the worse. Feel it in yourself. Then ask if this isthe effect you want to have. Emotions are alive. You have to negotiate withthem, and when an emotion sees a benefit in changing, it will—you will.6. FEELING YOUR WAYBecause so many people distrust their emotions and, particularly with men, tryto hide them, it’s a shock to hear that feeling your way through life worksbetter than thinking your way through life. In fact, this notion is so alienthat we feel the need to point out some strong psychological findings as supportfor it.First, researchers have discovered that emotions are part of every decision wemake. There is no such thing as a purely rational decision. When you try toeliminate feelings from the equation, you are repressing a natural aspect ofyourself. Do you spend more when you are in a good mood? You may not think so,but studies prove that good moods loosen up the pocketbook. Will you pay toomuch to feel more important, to look better in a salesman’s eyes? Many peoplewill.One of the most intriguing findings in this regard focused on an auction wheresubjects were asked to bid on a twenty-dollar bill. There was some confusion andlaughter over this game. It seems obvious that nobody would bid more than twentydollars for a twenty-dollar bill. But they did. Especially with males, winningthe auction and beating out the other guy were more important than rationality,and so the bidding went higher and higher until someone gave up. Of course, the“winner” had made a ridiculous purchase, but emotion was able to overridereason.People with a high EQ don’t shirk from the emotional component of decisionmaking. They are in touch with how they feel, and thus they tap into the deeperaspects of intuition and insight. Once you let your emotions comes to light, youdon’t have to act upon them (which is the chief fear of repressed people whocan’t bear the thought of letting their emotions get away from them). The nextstep is to realize that emotions possess intelligence, and beyond lies a deepertrust in intuition. Emotions unlock whole departments of consciousness that mostpeople are unaware of. For every “gut feeling” that turns out to be right, thereare countless other signals being sent to us every day that we need to feel, notanalyze.What to do: If you are already used to feeling your way through a situation,everything we’ve just said seems obvious, but that’s not true for someone whodistrusts emotion. Learning to be guided at the feeling level means taking onesmall step at a time. To get started, think about all those times when youpushed your gut feeling aside and went with your head, only to say later, “Iknew that would happen. Why didn’t I go with my feeling?” This isn’t arhetorical question. The reason you didn’t go with your gut feeling is that youhaven’t trained yourself to.The next time you’re conflicted between all the reasons to do something and thesimple fact that your emotions tell you not to, write down what each aspect ofyourself is saying. Then act, following your head or your gut. When thesituation resolves and you’ve found what the outcome is, go back and consultwhat you wrote down. This works best with people, because we all have someinteraction—going on a blind date, working for a new boss, talking to a carsalesman—in which feelings can’t be ignored and could make the differencebetween success and disappointment. If you note in writing what you felt, itbecomes much easier to trust your intuition the next time. Repetition is thekey, as well as looking with open eyes at how often your feelings turn out to beright.7. MEETING YOUR NEEDSWhen you have a need, who do you go to? Let’s be specific. You struck up thecourage to say something difficult, and the person you talked to shot you down.You are hurt and discouraged. The sting of their words rings in your ears. Whatyou need at that moment is solace and sympathy. If you go to a friend wholistens politely, murmurs a platitude or two, and quickly changes the subject,you’ve turned to the wrong person. You wouldn’t go to a donkey for milk, so whydid you do the equivalent in emotional terms?The answer is complicated, but it involves emotional intelligence. When theyhurt, most people are so desperate to unload their pain that they turn to thenext nearby person. If they happen to be married, they will almost certainlyturn to their spouse. But someone with a high EQ will know who is a sympatheticlistener and who isn’t. They will turn to the one and avoid the other.Consider a deeper need, the need for love. When this need is fulfilled inchildhood—a critical part of having emotional intelligence—being loved has comefrom the appropriate source, one’s parents. But parents can be withholding andunloving, which creates emotional confusion. You grow up not knowing who canactually give you the love you need, and then what happens? You experimentrather randomly, going from one person to the other without being able to seewho is capable of love. When you find someone who isn’t, who has a bit of loveto give, but not very much, you are likely to choose that person anyway. Acombination of insecurity, neediness, and emotional wounding leads you intorelationships that turn out to be frustrating, disappointing, and in the worstcases, toxic.Finding the right person to fulfill your needs is so basic for people with ahigh EQ that they are baffled when someone doesn’t. But the sad truth is thatwounded people mostly seek out other wounded people or even people who arelikely to hurt them. They are often made anxious by the behavior of someone whois emotionally healthy, because it threatens the isolated, closed-off emotionalexistence they are so accustomed to. Yet the effort must be made; otherwise, westumble through life feeling enormously unfulfilled.What to do: Most people find themselves somewhere between dating, courtship,marriage, and divorce. The gap between having a need and getting it fulfilled issomething they understand. In all relationships, you can’t ask someone else forsomething they don’t have to give. We find ourselves doing that anyway, askingfor sympathy from someone who is indifferent, for understanding from theself-centered, for love from the emotionally stunted, and worse.Yet the steps to solving this dilemma aren’t as difficult as you might suppose.When you feel a need, turn to the person who you are certain is able to fulfillit. Who is that person? You can only know if you’ve seen them respond in asimilar situation. Don’t guess. Don’t take a stab in the dark. People who arekind, loving, emotionally generous, and understanding don’t hide those traits.They live by them.You will soon find that most people want to be there for you. Who hasn’t found apleasant stranger on an airplane who winds up listening to our family situation,romance, work, and even our deep secrets? There’s an impulse to hold back,naturally, out of fear of rejection. But it’s not hard to first detect a sign ofopenness and then to take it one step at a time. A little openness leads tomore, and if you see that the other person has no more to give—no more time,advice, sympathy, or interest—you will take the hint.The only caveat is this: even someone who has love, sympathy, compassion, andunderstanding to give also has the right to say no. We realize how hard this isto accept. Rejection is the biggest reason that most people shy away fromencounters that contain any emotion. It’s easier to share your trouble with afamiliar friend or family member who sits there like a blank wall. Blankness isbetter than no. But needs are meant to be fulfilled, and you must develop thecourage to find the right people, even though you risk being sent away.The chances are that you won’t be, however. Not every need is for undying love.The most common need is to be listened to, followed closely by the need forsympathy and the need to be understood. Validation is the common thread. Onceyou’ve discovered that you can be validated—and deserve to be—you will bestronger inside. Then asking for love becomes much easier.Emotions evoke powerful responses, and all the needs we’ve talked about lead tochanges in the body. Science lags behind wisdom in this area. As a species we’vehad thousands of years to become wiser, an achievement not to be disparagedbecause everyone plays the fool at times. We look forward to the day whengenetics finds the magic combination of genetic modifications that lead towisdom. For now, the best guide is our emotions, which may keep ahead of scienceno matter how much genetics tries to catch up."},{"pageContent":"PART THREE[images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_008_r1.jpg][images/Chop_9780804140140_epub3_008_r1.jpg]GUIDING YOUR OWN EVOLUTION"},{"pageContent":"THE WISDOM OF THE BODYThe super genome has liberated our thinking about the body, so can it do thesame for the mind? Absolutely. No longer is the brain a castle in the air wherethe mind lives alone. Everything you think and feel is shared by the rest ofyour body. The brain doesn’t say something in English like “I’m bored” or “I’mdepressed.” Everything is chemical and genetic. The same language is understoodby every cell. Whatever happens in the brain is reflected in the exquisitelyintegrated activities of every cell.We are in the habit of believing that only the brain has awareness of you andyour surroundings. This belief has to change, because it can’t be denied thatthe whole body is intimately interconnected. Not just brain cells, but everycell’s knowledge has been honed for hundreds of millions of years. Of course, assoon as you say that a kidney cell is conscious, traditional biologists, who arewedded to the belief that biological interactions can only be random, will cry“foul!” If you go on to say that a gene or a microbe is as conscious as you are,many other scientists will be up in arms.But to be outraged by such notions isn’t good science. One of the most brilliantpioneers in quantum physics, Erwin Schrödinger, said, “Consciousness is asingular that has no plural…To divide or multiply consciousness is somethingmeaningless.” We are so used to separating mind and body that merging them intoone field of consciousness isn’t acceptable, but physics has known for over acentury that everything in the physical universe emerges from fields, whether itis the electromagnetic field from which light emerges, the gravitational fieldthat keeps your feet on the ground, or the quantum field, the ultimate source ofmatter and energy.Imagine right this minute that every cell is as conscious as a person. Thiswould demote the brain from its privileged position. We would have to abandonour belief that thinking is strictly mental, involving a stream of thoughts,images, and sensations inside the brain. But clearly there is a different kindof thinking—nonverbal, without visual images, possessing no voice—that silentlyupholds every cell. This cellular intelligence has been called the wisdom of thebody. To make a leap in your state of well-being, it is necessary to do onlythree things:Cooperate with your body’s wisdom.Don’t oppose your body’s wisdom.Increase your body’s wisdom.Even a few years ago this kind of language sounded like poetic license. Wisdomis a high-flown word we reserve for venerable sages and teachers. In modernlife, it’s not even a word we tend to use very often. But we aren’t dealing inmetaphors here. Wisdom is knowledge that comes only with experience, and yourcells have plenty of it. Every lifestyle choice we’ve recommended comes down toone thing: obeying and restoring the wisdom of the body. We’ve used thevocabulary of genetics so far. Let’s see if that vocabulary can be expanded toembrace the body’s wisdom as one thing—a field of consciousness—rather than bitsand pieces. This will set the stage for the most exciting possibility of all:influencing your own evolution and that of your children, perhaps even yourgrandchildren.WISE CELLS, WISE GENESCells are faced with many challenges. If you erase all of science’ssophisticated knowledge, a cell is like a water balloon that happens to bealive. But it can be endangered exactly like a water balloon. A puncture wouldlet out all the water inside; getting too hot would cause it to burst; too coldand it would develop ice crystals poking through the skin. A water balloon and acell both have to worry about staying intact in the face of a cruel,ever-changing environment. Over the eons, cells set out to solve this extremelytough challenge.Their solution is known as homeostasis, the ability to preserve a steady state“in here” no matter what’s happening “out there.” At first homeostasis wasprimitive. One-celled organisms evolved to have ion pumps (for chemicals likesodium, calcium, and potassium) on their outer membrane that could keep theright chemical and fluid balance inside them. The next step was to becomemobile, so that they could swim after food, escape predators, and head toward atemperature and light level that was best for their survival. The fact thatcells aren’t simply water balloons but incredibly complex life-forms is theresult of solving the whole problem of remaining balanced “in here.”Now jump ahead to the present moment. Your cells still “remember” how thesolution works, thanks to DNA. Genetic memory, working over vast periods oftime, ensures that no cell, however primitive, turns back into a water balloon.Having learned the trick of cell division, during which each strand of DNA makesa perfect duplicate of itself, life-forms marched forward. Memory wasevolution’s greatest invention—a totally invisible one—and once it appeared, ithad no reason to stop. Cells started remembering more and more things,developing more and more skills, as we do via our brain.At this moment, with the help of your genes, your cells remember how to keep youalive, an achievement science barely comprehends, because it takes so manydynamic, interlocked, perfectly synchronized events just to keep the chemicalbalance inside a heart, liver, and brain cell. Although programmed by the sameDNA, heart, liver, and brain cells perform dozens of tasks unique to themselves.In the new genetics, we have to think of the body as a community with 100trillion inhabitants (adding all of our body’s cells to the vast, teeming genesin the microbiome), each of whom has its own self-interest. A heart cell has toomuch to do on its own to step in for a liver cell, yet this game of “Me first”manages to be about sharing and cooperating as well, because if the heart cellgets tired of messages from the liver or brain and hangs up on the conversation,it dies.Homeostasis, which started out turning a water balloon into a cell, had tobecome a billion times more complicated as more cells were invited into thecommunity. Yet in essence, DNA kept repeating the same lesson: stay in balance,preserve a steady state “in here.” To show you how essential that is, considerprisoners who go on a hunger strike, as happened during “the Troubles” inNorthern Ireland when members of the IRA used such strikes as political protest.The body can remain in healthy balance for only three days drawing upon itsreserves of blood sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream and liver. Then it beginsto take sugar from your fat cells, and after three weeks or so, it turns to themuscles, which begin to waste away. Starvation mode sets in when the muscles areemaciated, and death becomes inevitable starting somewhere around 30 days,assuming that nothing but water is taken during that period. Mahatma Gandhi, whofasted to publicize the campaign for Indian independence, performed his longestfast for 21 days. The ten Irish Republican prisoners who attracted worldwidepublicity by hunger striking in 1981 survived between 46 and 73 days. (We aren’ttaking into account a person who is grossly obese and decides to stop eating;there are hospital records of survival for over a year without food when someonehas three hundred to four hundred pounds of fat and protein to draw upon.)Total fasting brings the progressive breakdown of homeostasis, which very soondisrupts normal functioning everywhere in the body and is eventually fatal. Andyet the survival period can be greatly extended simply by adding a small amountof sugar and salt to the water that is being drunk during the fast. Fasters whoadd a bit of honey to their water have gone up to five months before theystopped. It’s not just the calories that prolong life but maintaining the cells’ion (electrolyte) balance, the most basic factor that makes even the mostprimitive cell a living thing instead of a water balloon. (Note: We are notendorsing juice, honey, or sugar water fasting of any duration. The pros andcons of these regimens must be reserved for another time.)Notice how systematically the body reacts to total fasting, progressing from onestrategy to the next to remain in balance for as long as possible. The pointwe’re making is that the mechanism for the most basic survival has beenpreserved in your genetic makeup for over a billion years, while simultaneouslyyour super genome keeps up with everything you want to do today. Homeostasis isas complex as you are. This implies a much wider view of the mind-bodyconnection. As you think, feel, dream, imagine, remember, and learn from thepast while anticipating and planning for the future, your body must accommodateit all in the present while never sacrificing its self-interest, which is tosurvive, if not thrive, and remain healthy.A typical cell stores only enough oxygen and fuel to survive for a few seconds,so the fail-safe protections must come from elsewhere—in a word, cooperation. Acell “knows,” chemically speaking, that it will get oxygen and fuel from thebloodstream, so it doesn’t have to “think” about those things, devoting its“intelligence” to other processes. (We are using quotation marks here todifferentiate a cell’s naturally occurring intelligence from common usage, whichinvolves the volitional implementation of knowledge by the brain.)Unless homeostasis is disrupted and you begin to feel something out of theordinary (e.g., pain, dullness, fatigue, depression), the fail-safe mechanismsof the body remain out of sight. But we can relate them to our personalexperiences, and as we do, the mind-body connection transcends chemicals andbiological processes. Your cells are living the same experiences that you are,sharing the same purpose and meaning. As shown in the chart below, the inherentproperties of a single cell are astonishing.A CELL’S WISDOM: 9 ESSENTIALS FOR LIFEAwareness: Cells are acutely aware of their environment, meaning they areconstantly receiving and responding to biochemical cues. A single molecule isenough to make them change course. They adapt from moment to moment according tochanging circumstances. Not paying attention isn’t an option.Communication: A cell keeps in touch with other nearby cells and even some faraway. Biochemical and electrical messages are exchanged among cells to notifythe farthest outposts of any need or intention, however slight. Withdrawing orrefusing to communicate is not an option.Efficiency: Cells function with the least possible expenditure of energy. Theymust live in the present moment, but they are totally comfortable with that.Excessive consumption of food, air, or water is not an option. As they attemptto do the most with the least energy, they are constantly evolving to becomemore efficient.Bonding: Cells making up a tissue or organ are inseparable companions. Theyshare a common identity through their DNA, and even though heart, liver, kidney,and brain cells lead their own lives, they remain tied to their source no matterwhat they experience. Being an outcast is not an option. However, renegade cellscan create a cancerous tumor.Giving: The chemical exchange in the body is a constant give-and-take. Theheart’s gift is to pump blood to the other cells; the kidney’s gift is to purifythe blood for everyone else; the brain’s gift is to keep watch over the wholecommunity, and so on. A cell’s total commitment to giving makes receivingautomatic—it’s the other half of a natural cycle. Taking without giving back isnot an option.Creativity: As cells become more complex and efficient, they combine with eachother in creative ways. A person can digest food never eaten before, thinkthoughts never thought before, dance steps never seen before. These innovationsdepend on the cells being adapted to the new. Clinging to old behavior for noviable reason is not an option.Acceptance: Cells recognize one another as equally important. Every function inthe body is interdependent with every other. Nobody gets to be a control freak.Overstepping needs is not an option; otherwise an abnormality like cancer canresult.Being: Cells know how to be. They have found their place in the cosmos, obeyingthe universal cycle of rest and activity. This cycle expresses itself in manyways, such as fluctuating hormone levels, blood pressures, digestive rhythms,and the need for sleep. The off switch is just as important as the on. In thesilence of inactivity, the future of the body is incubating. Being obsessivelyactive and overbearing is not an option.Immortality: While cells will eventually die, they are immortal in the sensethat they use genes as well as epigenetics to pass on their knowledge,experience, and talents in stem cells long after they die. They withhold nothingfrom their offspring. This is a continuity of existence that is also a kind ofpractical immortality, submitting to death on the physical plane but defeatingit through the propagation of DNA. The generation gap is not an option.When any one of these nine essentials is disrupted, life itself is threatened.There’s no more glaring—or frightening—example than cancer. A cancer cell hasabandoned the essentials. Its actions make it virtually immortal on its own byendlessly dividing. It crowds out and kills neighboring cells. It has dismissedthe regulatory chemical signals from surrounding cells. Nothing matters but itsown self-interest; the natural balance of the cellular community has gonetragically awry.Oncology is actively deciphering the genetic triggers that are involved incancer. These are incredibly complex and interwoven. The diabolical truth isthat a malignant cell can draw upon the same “intelligence” as every other cell,but genetic mutation directs its activity into madness. Like a consummatecriminal, it wildly changes disguises to keep out of the clutches of the police,or in this case, the immune system. If cancer wasn’t such a dire threat, suchingenuity proves on yet another front that every possibility the human mind candevise has been anticipated by our cells.In the face of the incredible complexity posed by the super genome, somethingsimple and useful emerges: the nine essentials that cells preserve at all costsare the same essentials that make each of us human. The mind-body connection isso flexible that it can adapt, not just to adversity but also to perversity—theperversity of turning your back on what Nature has designed you to do, which isto remain in balance. When we submit our bodies to toxins, push them to thepoint of exhaustion, and ignore their signals of distress, we are flouting thewisdom inside every cell.On the other hand, we can align ourselves with the same wisdom, and when thishappens, the mind-body connection reaches its real potential.HOW TO LIVE THE 9 ESSENTIALS1. Have a higher purpose that goes beyond yourself.2. Value intimacy and communion—with Nature, other people, the whole of life.3. Keep yourself open to change. From moment to moment sense everything in yourenvironment.4. Nurture acceptance for all others as your equals, without judgment orprejudice.5. Relish your creativity. Seize on the renewed freshness of today, not clingingto the old and outworn.6. Feel how your being is cradled in the natural rhythms and patterns of theuniverse. Embrace the reality that you are safe and nurtured.7. Let the flow of life bring you what you need. The ideal of efficiency isallowing Nature to take care of you. Force, control, and struggle are not yourway.8. Feel a sense of bonding with your source, the immortality of life itself.9. Be generous. Commit yourself to giving as the reason for all abundance.These nine things fulfill the necessity of cooperating with your body’s wisdom,not opposing it, and doing what you can to improve it. We’ve crossed over fromlifestyle choices into making your life more meaningful, which is the wholepoint of well-being. You don’t simply want to feel better but to lay thefoundation for a fulfilled life.THE MIND FIELDWe strive to support our arguments with solid science, and seeing the body as afield of intelligence is no exception. When someone asks, “Where is the mindlocated?” most people will automatically point to their heads. Why? It maysimply be because so many sense organs are located there: eyes, ears, nose, andtongue. With so much information flowing into one part of the body, it couldmerely be habit that places the mind in our head. Mind and brain have taken upresidence together in a box called the skull. Is the brain actually so closed upin its box that it makes sense to speak of it as though it were a machine formaking mind, the way a laser printer makes documents? The new genetics makes usask some culturally radical questions, including the most radical of all: Is abrain even necessary for all forms of “awareness”?Evolutionarily, nervous systems are not always centralized. Some creatures, likejellyfish, have neuronal nets distributed throughout the body. While humans dopossess a central nervous system, we also have other, more distributed nervoussystems as well. We have a peripheral nervous system, which includes nerves thatgather information for the brain (e.g., the nerves in our sense organs) andnerves that send signals from the brain (e.g., telling our muscles what to do).After it was observed that the gastrointestinal tract can function quite wellwhen severed from the peripheral nervous system, it was concluded that thisconstitutes a weblike enteric (intestinal) nervous system.The deciding factor in calling the enteric nervous system a separate nervoussystem was the specialized ganglion cells that are located between muscle layersin the intestinal wall; these act like a local brain. If you sever the nervesthat contact them from the brain, these ganglion cells continue to instruct theintestine to move and absorb and secrete, working quite well and quiteautonomously as a self-contained functional unit.It turns out that the intestinal tract not only takes advice from the rest ofthe body. It harbors its own reactions. When bad news gives you a sinkingfeeling in the pit of your stomach, you are experiencing an emotion as surely asyou experience it in your head, and it usually precedes any thoughts you mighthave. Did the enteric nervous system create such a sensation on its own? That’sunclear, but it’s tempting to think so. Certainly many people trust their gutreactions over the confused and compromised responses that the brain is oftensaddled with when overthinking sets in.Findings about brain-like processes outside the skull have become common. Themuscles of your face are directly linked to your brain. While we assume that thebrain is telling the mouth and lips to smile when we’re feeling happy, thereverse is also true. Seeing a smile on someone else’s face can make you happy,and children are taught to smile as a way to break out of a sad mood. Whetherthis works or not varies from person to person, but it could be argued that theface is controlling the brain in those instances.It may be that other parts of the body override or rebel against the brain.Rudy, who plays basketball twice a week, has experienced a phenomenon known as“alligator arms.” When stressed, distracted, or anxious, the muscle memory ofthe arm and wrist freezes up, and the ball, shot with the brain’s bestintentions, can miss the basket by five feet.The conduction system of the heart, which organizes your heartbeat, can bethought of as the heart’s brain in the same way the ganglion cells in the gutare the brain of the intestines. The independence of the heart’s conductionsystem is shown when a transplanted heart keeps beating even though the nervesthat connected it to the donor’s central and peripheral nervous systems havebeen severed. The interaction between the heart’s independent processing and thebrain is complex and not fully understood.The immune system has been labeled a “floating brain.” In a very tangible way,thanks to what is called immune surveillance, your immune cells can “decide”whether an invading substance is friend or foe. If they decide wrong, youdevelop an allergy to harmless things—house dust, pollen, cat dander—that poseno danger and never needed to be repelled. Ask any allergy sufferer whethertheir allergy affects their thinking. The dullness, lack of energy, and depletedenthusiasm that many allergy sufferers experience leave little doubt about howthe immune system is part of a larger bodily intelligence.These findings are enough to establish that cultural assumptions about mind andbrain are full of gaps. The location of the mind is an open question, and anyattempt to isolate it physically in the skull runs into valid objections. Moreand more it looks as if every organ is the locale of its own version of mind.(You might imagine it like the United States, with a centralized federalgovernment, many state governments, and a myriad of local governments workingtogether and influencing one another.)Thinking is happening, in some guise or other, everywhere in your body all thetime. This emerging view has the potential to rock our accepted understanding ofmind itself. The brain looks more and more like an outcropping in a landscapethat is permeated with varied forms of intelligence. Let’s explore theimplications of this new model.In the old model, nerves were like the wiring that brings electricity to everypart of a house. But it’s not just the “wiring” of nerves that links brain tobody. Hormones and neurochemicals produced by all sorts of organs affect the waythe brain works and how you experience your mind. Consider the mood changesexperienced by many women around their menstrual period and menopause, or by menduring a midlife crisis. Other mental events are triggered in similar biologicalways. Ever feel sleepy after you’ve had too much to eat? Ever feel an adrenalinerush after public speaking or feel addled after you’re thrown accidentally fromyour bike? Hormones travel to the brain via the bloodstream, producing profoundeffects on the nature of “your mind.” A panicky thought created by adrenaline,secreted far away from the brain in the adrenal cortex, feels like “yourthought”—biology has mysteriously converted itself into mind.THE BRAIN OUTSIDE THE BRAINLooking at the brain itself reveals even greater complexity to the mind-brainrelationship. While people generally think of neurons as the particular braincells that produce the mind (acting together in almost infinitely complexnetworks), there are other cells in the brain without which the neurons couldnot do their jobs—the glial cells, for example, which outnumber neurons andperform many essential tasks: conveying nutrients and oxygen to neurons,creating the myelin sheaths around their long trunks (axons) to facilitatespeedy signal transmission, stabilizing connections between neurons, and servingas the immune system to protect cells against harmful microbes. In connectionwith Alzheimer’s disease, glial cells clean up debris from aging or injurednerve cells but can also turn against nerve cells and kill them. This “friendlyfire” can occur while trying to protect the brain from invaders like bacteria,viruses, and fungi.The cells that process mental events aren’t necessarily only “of the brain.”Neurons can also derive from other resident cells in the body, and some neuronsand many glial cells arrive in the brain via the circulatory system—they arelike nomads who eventually find a place to live permanently. Questions aboundabout how much this happens and in which different regions of the brain it istaking place. (The production of some brain cells might occur by circulatingstem cells that directly become neurons and glial cells, or by fusing withpreexisting cells.) All these issues are still being worked out by developmentalbiologists. It’s clear, however, that cells are trafficking between the body andthe brain all the time.So the boundaries between brain and nonbrain in the body are not clear cut. Thebrain is permeable to the rest of the body. To say the brain creates the mind isat best incomplete. It may be more accurate to say the brain provides access tothe mind. In a simple analogy, every automobile needs an engine in order to run.But an engine by itself goes nowhere. The functions that make a car a carrequire every part acting in concert. Likewise, the functions that our dynamicminds carry out are created by the body-brain complex, not by the brain alone.The brain has always been out of the box; it’s just been waiting for science tocatch up. Mainstream science is reluctant, if not dismissive, when faced withthe notion of mind outside the brain. Actually, getting your mind to moveoutside your head is relatively easy. If you burn your hand on the stove, yourattention immediately rushes there. The heartache of unrequited love takes one’sattention to the center of the chest. In various spiritual traditions, this kindof “moving mind” becomes a conscious skill. Here’s a common introductory exampleof “mind outside the box” from Zen Buddhist practice. Students who have taken ona disciplined daily Zen meditation—usually counting or following the breath—arethen advised to move their minds into the hara. The hara is the second chakra,or subtle energy center, located below the navel, just in front of the sacrum.One way to describe this “moving mind” exercise is to imagine that the mind islocated in a drop of honey in the center of the skull (where we usuallyexperience our mind anyway) and then to let the drop of honey slowly descenddown along the front of the spine until it finally reaches the hara.Succeeding in this exercise takes time and a great deal of practice. Initiallyit can feel as if there’s only a little movement, because your focus ofattention snaps back into your head like a rubber band. And so you begin again,letting the drop of honey slowly descend, bringing your mind with it. Why dothis? One reason is that when your mind moves from inside your skull into aposition in front of the sacrum, it can bring a jolt of energy, not unlike theway coffee suddenly energizes your mind a few minutes after downing your morningcup. What might otherwise have been sleepy Zen suddenly becomes awake Zen.More important, practitioners report that there is an exquisite sense ofstability in their mind when it’s brought to that location: thoughts still comeand go, but they take on a sense of waves rising and falling, or of cloudspassing overhead, rather than being like a restless monkey bouncing all over theroom. A mind running around in the space of uncontrolled thoughts makes ustired, but it also disguises the potential for having a silent, strong, stillmind.LOSING “MY” MINDNeuroscience is leery of subjective experiences, but the fact is thatpractitioners of Zen and other Eastern traditions routinely move their mind outof their head. The experience has been replicated for centuries; it isn’taccidental, haphazard, or hallucinatory. With enough practice, someone can movetheir mind into their little toe, shoulder, elbow, perhaps even across the room.The immediate answer of most neuroscientists is that such a subjective sense of“moving mind” either isn’t real or can be explained away as a kind ofneurological illusion, like the “phantom limbs” reported by patients after a legor arm has been amputated. The phantom limb seems to occupy the same space asthe real limb that was lost and even experiences pain.The best rejoinder to this claim is that a whole host of subjective experiencesin medicine are self-reported and cannot be measured without asking the patientwhat’s going on. Statements like “I feel a pain here,” “I’m depressed,” “I’mconfused,” and “I’ve lost my balance” can sometimes be traced to distorted brainactivity on an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scan, but only thepatient can relate what is actually happening. The brain scan can’t tell someonehe’s in pain when he says he isn’t. (When a bacterium avoids a toxin in a petridish or is attracted to food, can we claim to know that it isn’t feeling someprimitive form of repulsion or attraction?)There comes a time in all contemplative traditions when one’s sense of mind andof the ordinary self changes fundamentally, lasting for a moment or a lifetime.In Vedic and Buddhist traditions, these experiences are called Samadhi, in whicha connection is made with pure awareness at the deepest level. In Hebrewmystical practice this might be understood as D’vekut, in Christian practice“cleaving to God.” The ordinary thinking mind is left behind, and one arrives atconsciousness without content.Samadhi enters the shadow zone in which “my mind” dissolves into mind itself.Here, reality shifts dramatically. Instead of sitting inside the space of aroom, the person sits inside mental space (Chit Akasha in Sanskrit). The eventsthat take place are not strictly mental, however. On the inner voyage, time,space, matter, and energy emerge from silence much the way physics describescreation bubbling up from “quantum foam.” In our view, the inner experience ofmeditation, yoga, Zen Buddhism, and the like are not inferior to the datacollected on subjective states like pain, feeling happy, or falling in love.Brain scans offer a correlate with these experiences, but it takes a person tohave them.It makes people woozy, sometimes even apprehensive, to discover that there is noboundary between “me” and the whole world. What about the skin? It is portrayedin high school biology class as an impermeable barrier protecting you frominvaders assaulting the body from “out there.” But the metaphor of the skin asliving armor isn’t viable. Your skin is a community of your human cells andbacterial inhabitants. Pause and move your hand, observing how the wrist andfinger joints move under the skin. Why doesn’t the skin break down with all thismotion, the push and pull of your fingers closing and extending, your armbending and stretching? Because the bacteria lining the creases in your skindigest the cell membranes of dying skin cells and produce lanolin, whichlubricates the skin (as does the collagen connecting skin cells). How long would“you” and your genome last if your skin were cracking, open to infection justfrom typing on a laptop or waving good-bye to someone? Fortunately, we areliving communities thriving in harmonious interaction driven by the supergenome.The only reason we separate “in here” from “out there” may be biological ratherthan based on reality. Research is starting to account for the swing between theinner and outer world, a swing we all experience every day. Sometimes we directour attention to objects “out there,” sometimes to mental events “in here.” Onehypothesis now suggests specific neural activity within two complementarysignaling networks in the brain—one is active when you are dealing with theworld outside the body (called the task-positive network), while the other, the“default network” (or task-negative network), revs up when your focus is inward,as commonly happens in wakeful rest, introspection, or from lack of significantsensory input. Our brains are thought to alternate rapidly between these twonetworks, but when deep meditation is performed, they both activate together. Inmeditation, “inside” and “outside” are no longer opposite and contrary but areexperienced as a seamless whole. And gene activity is changing throughout thismagnificent process.THE FINAL FRONTIEROne last boundary keeps mind and body apart, a rigid belief in physicality. Theentire setup of the brain is physical. Every action a neuron takes is physical,and so are the coded sequences in DNA that create nerve cells. Thanks to the newgenetics, this coding has become far more transparent; with stunning advances intechnology, we can view the tiniest alterations in gene activity. Nowhere alongthe line, however, can you see DNA obey the mind. Thoughts are invisible, andscience is leery of anything that cannot be visibly detected and measured. Thevalidity of science is all about measurement, even if it takes an instrument aspowerful as an electron microscope to extend human sight.Yet we know that our minds are at work. The new genetics has helped the cause ofinvisibility, so to speak, by showing that subjective experiences in life canlead to epigenetic modifications that alter gene activity. In a way, the factthat our bodies change according to how we think and feel is so obvious itdoesn’t need science to prove it. The whole body responds when someone loses aspouse, a best friend, or a job, and in the wake of grief there can bedepression, greater susceptibility to disease, and even a risk of prematuredeath. Your super genome directly reacts to these life changes.All these changes are regulated by genes, and yet the lure of the physicalremains strong in mainstream science. A geneticist will first look at the chainof molecular alterations in DNA, finding more and more complex links, beforeanything as intangible as the emotion of grief is considered. This limitation isthe final frontier that must be crossed. How can that be accomplished?One angle is the concept of the field, which is basic in modern physics.Everything that happens physically at the level of atoms and molecules (whichare observable “things”) goes back to fluctuations in the field (which isinvisible and “no-thing”). You can see a compass needle point north, but youcan’t see the Earth’s electromagnetic field, which is causing the effect. Youcan see a leaf fall from a tree, but you can’t see gravity pulling it to theearth. Is something like this happening when genes become active?An intriguing experiment by British molecular biologists in 2009 mightilluminate this point. For decades we have known that DNA has the property ofrepairing itself, which it does by recognizing which parts of the double helixare incorrectly coded, broken, or mutated. When a cell divides and a strand ofDNA duplicates itself, recognition is also involved in reassembling the newstrand as each base pair finds its proper place. In their experiment, theBritish team placed separate strands of DNA in water and watched them begin toform round clumps (sphericals) of genetic material. A long sequence of 249chemical bases (called nucleotides) was marked with fluorescent dye to followhow it attached itself to other bits of DNA inside the clump.The results were astonishing and inexplicable. Exact matching sections of DNAwere about twice as likely to join together, recognizing each other even whenthey were separated in the water by distances that allowed no physical contact.To a cell biologist, this makes no sense, since it takes physical contact orchemical connections for anything to happen inside a cell. But in terms of thefield, the mystery has an explanation. Like a compass obeying the lines ofmagnetic force encompassing the planet, these strands of DNA could be obeying a“biofield” that keeps life intact.The research team dubbed the behavior of the DNA strands “telepathic” in theabsence of any physical connection that drew them together. The biofield,operating through infinitesimally tiny electric charges, might offer anexplanation less supernatural. But recognition is a trait we ascribe to themind. When you wait at the airport for a friend’s plane to land, you recognizewho she is out of a crowd of strangers, not by going one person at a time, butsimply by knowing who you’re looking for. In the same vein, but far moremysterious, an Antarctic penguin returning from the sea with food in its cropcan recognize which chick belongs to it, heading directly to the chick amongthousands of other penguin chicks.Something about recognition is basic and defies random choice. This is aproperty of the mind field that all of us depend on—at this moment you recognizewords on a page, not collections of alphabet letters that you sort through toobtain what they mean. Apparently DNA can do the same, because the 249nucleotides didn’t match up one by one; the entire sequence found its mirrorimage, defying randomness.GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THE FIELDThis telling experiment helps cross the final frontier, but it doesn’t get usentirely past physicality. To do that, we must accept that other, as yetindescribable and unmeasurable, factors are acting behind the scenes, organizingbits of matter into living creatures. In mystical traditions around the world,adepts have experienced this invisible agent.All that’s needed is to contact into your natural field of intelligence, presentfrom your brain down to every cell in your body. Fields are infinite, but youdon’t have to be. A small horseshoe magnet is an outcropping of the Earth’simmense magnetic field, and in turn, the Earth’s magnetic field is the tiniestspeck in the electromagnetic field of the universe. Yet every trait of thisinfinite field is present in a magnet. In the same way, you are an outcroppingof your mind as part of a larger mind field. This gives you an automaticconnection to it. When an experience of the mind field is clear, as in deepmeditation, perception changes. Some people who have entered this state ofconsciousness have reported the following experiences:They sensed infinity in all directions.Time and space stopped being absolutes—they were seen as purely mentalcreations.All separation ceased. Only wholeness was real.Every event was connected to every other, like waves rising and falling on anunbounded ocean.Life and death no longer represented a beginning or end. They were merged intothe continuum of existence.These realizations are available to everyone; you don’t have to attend a mysticsschool. There is nowhere to go, in fact, in pursuit of the mind field, becausewe are surrounded by it, down to our genes. It takes a special angle of visionto make the field show itself. In the Vedic tradition, a text called the ShivaSutras gives 108 ways to see beyond the mask of matter and discover what liesbeyond. One such technique is to see what lies beyond the sky. You can’t performsuch an act, not physically, but that’s not the point. In the attempt to seebeyond the sky, something else happens: the mind stops. Baffled by theimpossibility of the exercise, the normal stream of thought ceases. At thatinstant, the mind perceives only itself. No object obstructs pure awareness,and, aha! That’s what lies beyond the sky.A fish surrounded all of its life by water cannot know what water is actuallylike. But if it jumps out of the sea, there’s a contrast, and then wetness canbe experienced as the opposite of dryness. You can’t leap out of the mind field,but you can slow down your mind, and then there’s a similar contrast: you canexperience what stillness, silence, and the cessation of activity feel like.Even if you don’t practice meditation, which is where the great sages, saints,and mystics found their deep contact with the field, you can still get aglimpse. Sit quietly with your eyes closed, doing nothing. Notice the stream ofthoughts going through your mind. Each mental event is temporary. It comes,stays for an instant, and then departs. In between each mental event, noticethat there’s a brief gap. By diving into this gap, you can reach the mind fieldin its infinite extent. But you don’t have to try it this minute.Having glimpsed the gap between two thoughts, open your eyes. Consider whatyou’ve just experienced. Mental events rise—but from where? Mental events fadeaway—but where to? The mind field. We pay so much attention to our thoughts thatwe miss this simple point. Each thought is a transient event, while the mind ispermanent and unchanging. Did you feel how easy it is to notice this? For abrief moment you’ve become a Gyan Yogi, someone who is united with the mindfield. Or to be more precise, someone who knows they’re united with the mindfield, because there’s no such thing as losing contact with the field. We justforget about the field, being obsessed over the mind’s constant round ofthinking, feeling, sensing, and imagining.We aren’t criticizing the activity of the mind. Experiencing the mind field onlydeepens your appreciation of life. It engenders the wonder that caused thePersian poet Rumi to exclaim, “We come spinning out of nothingness scatteringstars like dust,” and on another occasion, “Look at these worlds spinning out ofnothingness /This is within your power.”Life evolves according to patterns everyone finds beautiful to behold. Evolutiongave rise to the human genome and the brain, the most complex structure in theknown universe. Can this mystery be solved by looking beyond the mask of matter?The body exhibits almost infinite “intelligence” in every cell. What we refer toas cellular “intelligence” is the cell’s natural ability to adapt, respond, andmake the right choices at every moment not only for itself, but in service toevery other cell, tissue, and organ in the body. Something caused this tohappen. In pursuit of that something, we need to address evolution itself, theforce that makes it possible for all of us to be here in the first place."},{"pageContent":"MAKING EVOLUTION MINDFULThe super genome has vastly expanded the idea of the responsive and adaptablecell. It opens the door for many other exciting prospects. A responsive andadaptable cell can modify its DNA as its environment poses new challenges andopportunities. It can receive and interpret messages from the brain and respondin kind. The cell therefore adapts to our life experiences, constantlyreorganizing and attaining balance to better serve itself and other cells in thebody. What we witness is a mind-body partnership. The human mind is conscious.It uses adaptation, feedback loops, creativity, and complexity in astonishingways—they are the prized possession of our evolutionary place in Nature. Cellsmirror the mind, giving physical expression to it.There’s only one problem with this picture, and it’s a big one. The theory ofevolution doesn’t consider that genes mirror consciousness. Introducing a termlike “the intelligent gene” would be anathema, even though most geneticistsdidn’t protest “the selfish gene.” To be selfish implies making choices to serveonly oneself, and it takes consciousness to do that. Our cells make choices allthe time. Imagine a steel pellet moving in a circle on a sheet of paper. Thepellet seems to be magically moving on its own, until you look under the paperand see that a magnet is actually controlling it. Something similar seems to behappening with the activity of cells in your body.Let’s say you were somehow able to observe heart cells individually, and for noapparent reason they start twitching like mad, only to slow down a minute later.They appear to undertake this action on their own, but if you step back, itturns out that the person who owns the heart ran up a flight of stairs. Theheart cell responded to instructions from the brain, and the brain was obeyingthe mind. That’s how the partnership works. What we deem intelligent is theperson, not his cells. Even brain cells come second in the partnership, becausemind is always first.Evolutionary theory finds itself in the reverse position, putting matter first.Mind, as far as conventional modern Darwinism is concerned, evolved from basiccellular activity that was mindless. Chemical interactions became more complex,as did the cell’s ability to adapt to its surroundings. Single cells started toclump together to form complex organisms. After hundreds of millions of years,the clumps became specialized, and the central player was a clump that evolvedinto nerve cells, primitive nervous systems, and finally primitive brains. Weknow all of this because, lucky humans, our clumped nerve cells stand at thepeak of brain evolution. The human brain made us conscious, aware, creative, andhighly intelligent.This book has proposed, to the contrary, that cells and genes participate in thesame mind field as the brain. This theory is acceptable to anyone who believes,as Darwinians do, that matter comes first. But our view has one big advantage.It opens up a new frontier in the mind-body partnership. Pandas will never stopeating bamboo shoots; tigers will always stalk deer; penguins will always walkacross the Antarctic ice fields to lay their eggs—at least for the foreseeablemillion years. It would take at least that long for a mutated gene to alter suchpowerful instinctive behavior.But human beings can change their diet, renounce violence, become vegetarians,and have babies in a warm hospital instead of the Antarctic. We are endlesslyadaptable. Therefore we’ve pushed evolution far beyond physical boundaries. Ourskin radiates heat in such quantity that spending a winter’s night outdoorswould be fatal to a naked human, yet we’ve sidestepped such a huge disadvantagethrough clothing, shelter, and fire. We’ve become evolutionary oddballs, withouta doubt. But our next advance may outstrip anything accepted in mainstreamDarwinism.Human beings could be the first creatures in the history of life on Earth toself-direct where their evolution is going. If so, the super genome becomes thekey to everyone’s future, starting with what each of us is thinking and doingright this minute.To get there, however, three major changes would need to be established in ourunderstanding of evolution, and each of them would topple a pillar of Darwiniantheory.First, evolution must be driven by more than random chance.Second, evolution has to drastically speed up, able to bring changes not inhundreds of thousands and millions of years, but in a single generation.Third, evolution must be self-organizing and thus mindful, allowing for theinfluence of choice making, learning, and experience.These are serious challenges to the status quo. Ordinarily the argument wouldtake place within the small circle of professional evolutionists. But the goalis so important to everyone’s life that we want to bring you into the privilegedcircle. As much as any famous geneticist deserves to talk about where humanevolution is headed, you also deserve to. Let’s examine the three changes toDarwinism that need to occur, not because we two authors say so, but becausethese are the very changes that may lie ahead, thanks to the new genetics.IS EVOLUTION JUST A LUCKY BREAK?We mentioned at the outset that the notion that all new mutations occur onlyrandomly belong among the discarded myths about genetics. At that point, thesound of many an angry evolutionary biologist hurling heavy objects across theroom could be heard in the background, because far and away the phenomenon ofsolely random mutations has been a primary tenet of Darwinism. To claimotherwise has been a standard line of attack among anti-evolutionists with areligious agenda, and it’s hard to remove that stain.In Darwinian theory, the mutations that drive evolution aren’t driven by lifeexperiences. According to Darwin, a giraffe didn’t acquire its long neck becauseit wanted to have one or needed one. The longer neck appeared accidentally oneday, and that lucky mutated giraffe then gained a survival advantage that wasnaturally selected to be passed on to subsequent generations. It’s obvious thata longer neck allows giraffes to reach leaves higher up on a tree, but Darwinismdoesn’t allow for any “why” to intrude. Classical evolutionary theory doesn’tallow you to say a long neck appeared “because” the animal needed to eat higherup on the tree; it would say the new mutation was random and persisted “because”it gave the animal this new ability to survive.Outside the field of evolution, we talk about “why” and “because” all the time.If a basketball player is three inches taller than everyone else on the courtand scores more rebounds, it’s because he’s got the advantage of height. So whycan’t we say the same about the giraffe? The reason has to do with how mutationsare passed along. That first lucky giraffe had to survive or else its newmutation goes nowhere. Next the mutated gene had to appear in the nextgeneration. If it still gave a survival advantage, the gene was now present inmore than one animal—this improved its fighting chances.But the odds were still hugely against it, because to be permanentlyestablished, the mutated gene had to find its way into the genome of everygiraffe; the short-necked ones had to be so disadvantaged that they disappearedfrom the gene pool. The process is a numbers game, pure statistics repeatedgeneration after generation. All that matters is the gene and how successfullyit gets passed on. Evolutionists may speculate, using common sense, that alonger neck allowed favored giraffes to get at leaves that shorter giraffescouldn’t reach, but that’s not all there is to the story, scientifically. Thehard data pertain to the persistence of a mutation over time.Thanks to modern gene theory, the statistics of survival have been honed to afine degree. Facing the iron wall of random mutations is daunting; you will findthe entire genetics establishment rejecting your contrary ideas. At least thatwas true in the past, up to the last decade. Now the iron wall has becomesomething else, a gap.A gap is friendlier than a wall, because it only needs a bridge, not a wreckingball. On one side of the gap we have the obvious fact that human beings areintelligent. On the other we have Darwinian theory, which considers intelligencea suspicious term. The term was corrupted by the intrusion of IntelligentDesign, a movement that attempted to use science to justify the Book of Genesis.That attempt was foiled by massive protest from the scientific community, and weconcur. So we don’t need to fight that same battle all over again. The rancorousdivide between reason and faith needs to be healed, because both deserve theirrightful place.The gap is starting to close as new findings put pressure on conventionalevolutionary theory. Random mutations aren’t the whole story, as the newgenetics is fast proving. (As the great Dutch-Jewish philosopher Spinoza said,“Nothing in Nature is random. A thing appears random only through theincompleteness of our knowledge.”) Natural selection isn’t the whole story,either. Unlike giraffes, microbes, and fruit flies, human beings don’t existsolely in the state of Nature. We exist in a culture that has deep influences onhow the super genome works. If a bad mouse mother can pass on her behavior toher offspring, human behavior could be doing the same, but on a much widerscale.If the gap between standard evolution and the new genetics can be closed, that’stremendous news for you and every other individual. It means that you areactually evolving in real time, and if that’s true, huge things follow.Can evolution remain intact while at the same time giving up on pure randomnessas absolute truth? Can mindful evolution move from Darwinian dogma toestablished fact? It has to, if the super genome is going to fulfill itsenormous promise.THE FALL OF RANDOMNESSThe evidence that gene mutations are not simply random is steadily mounting. Ina 2013 study published in the high-impact science journal Molecular Cell,researchers from Johns Hopkins University showed that when mutations aredeliberately introduced into yeast to impair their growth, new mutationsimmediately arise to bring growth back. These are called compensatory secondarymutations. They are anything but random. Compensatory mutations can also ariseif the solution in which the yeast is raised is depleted of necessary nutrients,creating a more stressful environment. Although yeast is a very basic organism,the lesson here is that when environmental challenges are evident, the genomecan quickly adapt and compensate with necessary (nonrandom) mutations forpurposes of survival. Epigenetic modifications of gene activity can be utilizedfor the same purpose.Another study, concerning E. coli bacteria and published in Nature, arrived at asimilar conclusion. Mutation rates were highly variable along different parts ofthe bacteria’s genome. Researchers detected a lower rate of mutation in geneswith high activity. Contrary to the idea that all mutations are random, themutation rate among genes appears to have been evolutionarily optimized toreduce the occurrence of harmful mutations in certain genes that are mostcritical for survival. By the same token, increased rates can be found wheremutation is most useful—for example, in immune genes that have to constantlyrearrange to make new antibodies as protection against invading pathogens. Whileit’s still not exactly clear how mutations are directed to some genes and not toothers when the environment is challenging, a leading hypothesis that’s beingexplored is that epigenetics plays a key role.Obviously Darwin, living in the nineteenth century, could not have known thatmutation rates vary widely along different spots in the genome. He did not evenknow about the genome. It’s getting less and less tenable in the twenty-firstcentury for strict Darwinians to abide by the dogma that mutations occur onlyrandomly and are later subjected to natural selection. The actual rate ofmutation at any spot in the genome is affected by multiple factors that vary forthe purposes of DNA protection or repair, or by epigenetic factors. This isn’t arandom process.Is there enough room in the new genetics to say that each person is evolving atthis very moment? Not yet. There are more hurdles to cross, beginning with thespeed of evolution, a crawl so slow that species often take millions of years toevolve.There is also fascinating evidence that cancer mutations are not entirelyrandom, as previously thought. Since the scientific details are rather dense,see the Appendixes, this page [Chop_9780804140140_epub3_bm_r1.xhtml#page282],for a technical discussion of this issue.SPEEDING UP THE CLOCKIn traditional Darwinism, a species must wait around for a gene mutation tooccur randomly. If it promotes survival, the mutation establishes a newbehavioral or structural feature in the carrier. It can then take millions ofyears to spread through the population of the species. But with epigenetics,these changes can happen in large swaths of the population in the very nextgeneration.Establishing exactly how long it takes for evolution to occur is arguable, andthe discussion can begin in many places. Let’s start with Darwin’s “specialdifficulty,” as he called it, a difficulty that would have far-reaching effects.The problem had to do with ants and honeybees. Darwin could not fathom howsterile female ants continue to show up generation after generation in thecolony even though they cannot reproduce. He noted how different the sterilefemales were in terms of behavior and body shape from the fertile females. Eventhough the sterile females obviously couldn’t propagate and therefore had zerochance to breed, how could their genes keep being passed on? Darwin didn’t knowabout genes, but his theory depended on survival, which isn’t possible if anentire class of ants is sterile.Finding the answer was impossible until the advent of epigenetics, long afterDarwin passed on. Epigenetics explains how chemical modifications of DNA canpermanently alter gene activity, turning it up or down. This process can happenafter the moment of birth, sidestepping the baffling issue of passing on newgenes—all that’s needed is to modify the existing ones. On his own, Darwin gotclose to the answer. He speculated that it could be found in the caste systemsof honeybees.Depending on the type of food the honeybee larvae eat, they can be candidatesfor queen or instead end up as sterile workers in the hive. The difference comesdown to a special food known as royal jelly, which contains nutrients thatfoster greater development of the ovaries. It’s been shown that the precisemechanism involves epigenetic alterations of select genes. While the queen bee’sdiet allows her to live for years and lay millions of eggs, the brief life of aworker bee is relegated to keeping house, taking care of the young, andforaging—basically doing whatever needs to be done for the good of the hive.A similar mechanism functions in an ant colony. Darwin ultimately went on topropose that in the case of ants, natural selection does not apply only to theindividual but also to the family and society. He was beginning to see how anentire colony could be viewed as a single evolving “super organism,” which ishow we see it today.Diet can further modify gene activity to program certain honeybees to emitpheromones instructing them either to take care of the young or to go out andbring back food. Gene activity can be modified by the action of enzymes known ashistone deacetylases (HDACs), which remove chemicals known as acetyl groups fromthe epigenetically modified genes. It turns out that royal jelly contains HDACinhibitors that secure a honeybee’s position as a possible future queen.Interestingly, while we were writing this book, the FDA approved the drugFarydak, the first epigenetic drug—a HDAC inhibitor for treating recurring formsof a specific cancer, multiple myeloma (MM). Farydak reverses epigenetic changesthat occur on certain genes, with the intention of preventing the spread of MMto other parts of the body.After 150 years, Darwin’s “special difficulty” has led to the realization thatepigenetics determines not only the fate of bee larvae, but also their laterbehavior. This genetic detour speeds up evolution for all practical purposes.Just as important, it makes evolution personal. In standard Darwinian theory,evolution is totally impersonal. To take hold, a new gene mutation must bepassed on within a large chunk of the population of plants or animals. Theflightless wings of a penguin, for example, allowed the whole species to survivethrough diving in the sea and swimming continuously after fish. But epigeneticschanges the life of the individual. In the case of the honeybee, the entire lifeof a single sterile female is determined by epigenetic modifications. Thisdifference may have explosive implications for human beings. We’ve been offeringthe mounting evidence that epigenetic switching is the key factor in lifestylechoices and well-being. But getting evolutionists to consider, much less agreewith, this new scheme meets with considerable resistance.There is presently a heated controversy over whether Homo sapiens hasgenetically advanced over our relatively brief life as a species. After leavingAfrica 200,000 years ago, our ancestors populated far-flung locales around theworld, and as they did, the facial features, skin, and skeletal structure ofeach major group became distinctive. An Asian face doesn’t resemble a Europeanface in key ways, just as African skin resembles the skin of neither one ofthose populations.As the noted biologist and writer H. Allen Orr explains, “Geneticists might findthat a variant of a given gene is found in 79 percent of Europeans but in only,say, 58 percent of East Asians. Only rarely do all Europeans carry a geneticvariant that does not appear in all East Asians. But across our vast genomes,these statistical differences add up, and geneticists have little difficultyconcluding that one person’s genome looks European and another person’s looksEast Asian.”It’s been argued that so much is different from genome to genome that the timeline must be sped up to account for it. Some evolutionists believe that up to 8percent of genetic changes occurred through natural selection in just the past20,000 to 30,000 years, a blink of an eye in evolutionary time when you considerthe rise of the horse, for example, from a small ancestor, Eohippus (Greek for“dawn horse”), which was only twice the size of a fox terrier and roamed NorthAmerica between 48 and 56 million years ago.In the midst of this controversy, where the data tend to be very “soft” and theconclusions speculative, it’s not even clear if our genome changed out ofadvantages in survival (getting more food) or mating. One camp suggests thatgenetic changes were not entirely due to random mutations and natural selectionbut were driven by culture. Because human beings live in collective communities,it is plausible, the argument goes, that traits that promoted community skillswere favored through breeding and therefore got passed down to the modern day.But exactly how a gene promotes a specific skill is questionable. It’sintriguing to follow the struggle that Yale physician and social scientistNicholas Christakis went through before publicly stating that “culture canchange our genes.”That’s the title of an online article from 2008 in which Christakis declares, “Ihave changed my mind about how people come literally to embody the social worldaround them.” As a social scientist, he had seen abundant evidence that people’sexperiences—of poverty, for example—shaped their memories and psychology. Butthat was the limit. As a doctor, “I thought that our genes were historicallyimmutable, and that it was not possible to imagine a conversation betweenculture and genetics. I thought that we as a species evolved over time framesfar too long to be influenced by human actions.”REAL-TIME EVOLUTIONWithout using epigenetics to describe why he changed his mind, Christakis givesa striking example of how culture talks to genes:> The best example so far is the evolution of lactose tolerance in adults. The> ability of adults to digest lactose (a sugar in milk) confers evolutionary> advantages only when a stable supply of milk is available, such as after> milk-producing animals (sheep, cattle, goats) have been domesticated. The> advantages are several, ranging from a source of valuable calories to a source> of necessary hydration during times of water shortage or spoilage. Amazingly,> just over the last 3 to 9 thousand years, there have been several adaptive> mutations in widely separated populations in Africa and Europe, all conferring> the ability to digest lactose….This trait is sufficiently advantageous that> those with the trait have notably many more descendants than those without.Three thousand to nine thousand years is race-car speed across evolutionaryepochs, but Christakis can no longer see any reason for doubt. “We are evolvingin real time,” he writes, “under the pressure of discernible social andhistorical forces.” These words don’t seem dramatic until you realize that“social and historical forces” are to some extent under human control. Afterall, we start wars, wipe out entire populations, enforce starvation, and, on thepositive side, bring relief to famines, cure epidemic diseases, and reformpoverty.The clincher for Christakis was a 2007 article by University of Wisconsinanthropologist John Hawks and his colleagues in the prestigious Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences offering evidence that human adaptation hasbeen accelerating over the last 40,000 years. A sped-up rate of “positiveselection,” the authors say, can be statistically proven by studying genomesaround the world, supporting “the extraordinarily rapid recent genetic evolutionof our species.” A panorama of possibilities suddenly opened up. Geneticvariants may have favored some people to survive epidemics like typhoid afterthe rise of cities and much closer contact with others.Once Christakis began thinking this way, he realized that culture isn’t speakinga soliloquy, and neither are genes—they have always been in a dialogue. “It ishard to know where this would stop. There may be genetic variants that favorsurvival in cities, that favor saving for retirement, that favor consumption ofalcohol, or that favor a preference for complicated social networks. There maybe genetic variants (based on altruistic genes that are a part of our hominidheritage) that favor living in a democratic society, others that favor livingamong computers….Maybe even the more complex world we live in nowadays really ismaking us smarter.”Real-time evolution is crucial to the super genome. We can be certain that it’shappening in the microbiome, because bacteria live very short lives and areprone to rapid mutations. But if radical well-being is to become a reality,real-time evolution must apply to the whole mind-body system. How would thatwork? Before Darwinism triumphed, there were other evolutionary theories, andone in particular that foresaw that creatures could evolve in a single lifetime.The French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was a supporter ofevolution decades before Darwin. He was a hero on the battlefield againstPrussia and a gaunt, determined figure in the laboratory. He eventually diedblind, impoverished, and publicly ridiculed; until very recently, hisevolutionary ideas remained an object of scorn, in fact, because they rancontrary to Darwin’s. Lamarck proposed that species evolve in accord with thebehaviors of the parents. For example, he claimed that if you read hundreds andhundreds of books and become learned, you would then have smart children.Obviously this is not the case. But in view of epigenetics, Lamarck’s ideas nowappear a little less absurd.He could be considered the father of “soft” inheritance, which lies at the coreof epigenetics—traits that get passed on to the next generation if the mother orfather has had a strong enough experience to create epigenetic marks (likeundergoing a famine or torture camp) or if the pregnant mother smokes or drinksto excess, or is exposed to environmental toxins. With the tremendous advancesin genetic analyses of genomes all the way from the human to the viral, we havevalidated not just Darwin’s theories of “hard” inheritance but also someLamarckian principles as well. Without being exactly right, he is no longerabsurd.A growing body of epigenetic data says that Lamarck was at least on the righttrack. Soft inheritance is a prime example of sped-up evolution. Yet it stillremains to be proven that lifestyle changes in the parents can be passed on tothe next generation. Are they strong enough, and do they persist long enough atthe epigenetic level? These are open questions at present. Lacking any knowledgeof genetics, Darwin could never even attempt to answer these questions. But somecombination of soft and hard inheritance one day will.BRINGING IN THE MINDWe began this chapter by saying that evolutionary theory needed to undergo threechanges for the super genome to fulfill its potential. We’ve covered the firsttwo, removing the barrier for random mutations and speeding up the rate ofevolutionary change. What remains is the third and potentially mostcontroversial point, bringing in a role for mind. Since the very word is soexplosive, we will substitute terms that describe how systems work when theybecome highly complex and evolved. There is no use butting heads witharch-materialists—many of them consider mind an offshoot of physical activity inthe brain, like the heat thrown off by a bonfire.We wrote an entire book, Super Brain, about the relation between mind and brain,strongly supporting the position that mind comes first, brain second. But a bookon genetics must stand on its own. There is no controversy, or little enough,that complex systems are self-organizing, using feedback loops as a form oflearning. Learning implies evolution, whether we call it mindful learning or thebehavior of a complex system. With that settled, let’s proceed.What would mindful evolution look like? It would have direction, meaning, andpurpose. The beauty of a brilliant bird of paradise in the New Guinea rainforest, the fearful symmetry of a tiger, the quivering gentleness of a deer—allsuch traits would be intentional. There would be a reason for them to existbeyond survival of the fittest.As with other aspects of the new genetics, the absurdity of such a notion hasgradually been softened. While it’s still a huge leap to claim that evolutionhas a purpose and a goal (technically known as teleology), it’s no longer viableto call evolution totally blind. The pivot occurred when the concept ofself-organization began to take hold over the past few decades. When you were ateenager, you probably had a typical teenager’s bedroom where the lack oforganization is total, with clothes strewn everywhere, an unmade bed, and so on.But as an adult you faced the need to organize your life, since the alternativeis chaos. Evolution was faced with the same dilemma, and becoming more organizedin order to avoid chaos brought the same solution.In 1947 a brilliant neuroscientist and psychiatrist, W. Ross Ashby, published apaper titled “Principle of the Self-Organizing System.” His definition of“organization” didn’t revolve around its usefulness, the way it’s useful to runan organized business instead of a disorganized one. Nor did Ashby judge beingorganized as good versus bad. He claimed instead that organization pertains tocertain conditions among the connected parts of an emerging system. This turnsout to have tremendous implications for how our genome organizes itself.In Ashby’s view, a self-organizing system is composed of parts that are joined,not separated. Most important, each part must affect the other parts. The waythat the parts regulate each other is the key. A stove isn’t self-regulating. Ifyou put on the teakettle and walk away, the temperature gets hotter and hotteruntil the water boils away and the kettle starts to melt and fuse with theburner. But a thermostat is self-regulating. You can set the desired temperatureand walk away, knowing that if the room gets too hot, the thermostat will turnoff the heat.You couldn’t survive if your body operated like a stovetop. Processes cannot beallowed to run away with themselves. An unchecked fever of even five degreesabove normal human body temperature threatens brain damage and eventually death.Growing too cold shuts down the metabolism and leads to hypothermia, which inextreme cases can also prove fatal. The self-regulation of a thermostat existseverywhere in the body, regulating not just temperature but dozens of processes.Because of self-regulation, you don’t grow and keep on growing; your heart ratedoesn’t speed up and keep on accelerating; the fight-or-flight response doesn’tmake you run away and keep on running.Every cell in your body developed through orderly, self-regulated steps,reaching amazing complexity in the fetal brain. In the span of nine months,beginning with a single fertilized egg, nerve cells begin to differentiate, atfirst in isolation but quickly forming a network. By the second trimester, newbrain cells are being formed at the fantastic rate of 250,000 per minute, andsome estimates raise this to 1 million new cells per minute just before birth.These cells aren’t simply globs of life bunched together. Each has a specifictask; each relates to other nerve cells around it; the entire brain knows whereevery one of its 100 billion cells belong.Connections, networks, and feedback loops are key to all self-organizingsystems. Billions of years ago, early bacteria may have started outindependently, but as they encountered one another in the soil, they began tointeract and form communities—eventually they totally depended on one another tosurvive and thrive. In our bodies, as we’ve seen, bacteria network with our owncells. They share much of our DNA and interact to form an immensely complex andsophisticated microbiome. Evolution has made our survival completely dependentupon them. If in the twentieth century we spent most of our time figuring outhow to fight microbes, in the twenty-first century we are focusing on how toharmoniously coexist with them. The super genome is the ultimate self-organizingsystem, because it reflects the entire history of life on Earth.DNA, it goes without saying, is incredibly orderly, putting billions of basepairs in order. This is more than ordinary chemical bonding, however. Inside acell, active self-organizing is going on. Specific chromosomes occupy specificpositions in the nucleus. Only 3 percent of the genome is actually made ofgenes, and the gene-poor regions are near the edge of the nucleus, where thereis the least ability for epigenetics to modify gene activity. In contrast, thegene-rich areas of the genome are in the center of the nucleus, where regulationof gene activity is most concentrated. Genes that are controlled by the sameproteins tend to cluster together in genomic “neighborhoods,” making it easierfor those proteins to find the genes they regulate all in one place. Everythingwe see in the genome says it is not laid out randomly, but logically. With thatsaid, it would be a mistake to then go to the other extreme and say it was“designed” this way. The design becomes apparent only after the fact. Thejourney there was carried out by the principles of self-organization.Self-organizing systems exist as their own reasons and cause—they constantlyre-create themselves with new interactions. This leads to new states of orderthat are never complete. For example, an atom is actually a sub-microscopicsystem that obeys rules of orderliness. Electrons are arranged so that an atomof oxygen is different from an atom of iron. But room has been left for change.Because the outer electrons in these atoms can bond, ferrous oxide—commonrust—is created. It, too, isn’t completely stable, leading to more changes. Rustis more complex than either oxygen or iron, its two components. Thus complexityfuels greater self-organization, and vice versa.This is the continuing miracle of evolution, that it defies chaos by making evergreater creative leaps. If you pile up sand on a beach, you get a sand dune.It’s massive but not complex; nothing holds it together as a system—onehurricane is enough to disintegrate the dune and make it disappear. But as cellsaccumulate in a fetus, they don’t simply pile up like grains of sand. They bond,interact, and organize. So a strong wind doesn’t cause the human body todisintegrate.But this is just the beginning of the story. Complexity and self-organization,proceeding hand in hand, learned how to create life, and life learned how tothink. Set aside for the moment that thinking, as most evolutionists see it,emerged only with the human brain. The entire march of events leading up to thebrain shows that new states of order are never complete. As the eminenttheoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman put it, “Evolution is not just ‘chancecaught on the wing.’ It is not just a tinkering of the ad hoc, of bricolage, ofa contraption. It is emergent order honored and honed by selection.”KEEPING IT TOGETHERThe chemical bond that joins oxygen and iron atoms to make rust is physical, butthe operation of your genome contains something that goes far beyond thephysical. The technical term for this invisible X factor is self-referral. Itmeans that a system keeps tabs on itself by constantly sending messages back andforth so that a circle of change is also a circle of stability.The key to self-referral is the feedback loop. When a gene makes a protein, youcan be sure that either directly or indirectly that protein will help regulatethe activity of the gene somewhere down the line. Simply put, if A produces B, Bmust in some way directly or indirectly govern A. Your own choices, physical ormental, come back to govern you. The scale can be very large or very small. Ifyou are single and decide to marry, this decision puts all your past memories ina new light, just as getting sick puts wellness in a new light and growing oldputs youth in a new light. Each phase of life moves forward while at the sametime gathering the past around it.Self-referral is also how your genes can respond with just what’s needed foryour life today while never losing sight of their programming from the past. Atthe same time, through mutations and epigenetic marks, the present has thecapacity to alter these instructions. This is the basis of self-referral at itsvery roots. Nothing is produced in the universe without coming back to somehowcontrol that which produced it. In spiritual terms, there is the principle ofmoral balance between good and evil (the law of Karma), stated in Christianityas “As you sow, so shall you reap.” In Newtonian physics, it’s the third law ofmotion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Oppositesshould pull a system apart, but they don’t, because the invisible element ofself-organization keeps them intact.Feedback mechanisms underlie the links between an organism and its environment.Allow us to explain this a bit technically, because feedback is such a strongelement of the argument. We now know that genes are resilient to forces andcounterforces. In evolution, new mutations occur when there is stress andchallenge in the environment. When challenging conditions arise, the DNA ofcertain genes becomes exposed so it can be switched on or off by epigenetics, orturned up or down in activity by specific proteins called transcription factors.This first involves changes in the actual folding and topography of the DNA.As a result, the exposed regions of DNA can be more prone to mutation. So inthis model, which is increasingly becoming more accepted, mutations do not occurin random spots in the genome. Changes in the environment lead to changes in howthe DNA is folded (not in the actual sequence of base pairs). This determineswhich gene regions are exposed to possible mutation. In other words, theenvironment, life exposures, stresses, and outside challenges affect how the DNAis folded in the nucleus, laying certain regions more exposed to mutation thanothers. In this case, mutations aren’t random but arise downstream ofenvironmental conditions. Even though some speculative thinking is involvedhere, the feedback between genes and outside conditions is key. It enables anorganism to adapt to the conditions that Nature brings. So reliable is thismechanism that it has sustained life from the first primordial micro-organismsonward.As every component of the genome emerged and interacted with other components,they regulated each other to assemble what appears to be a logical design. Butin actuality there was no preconceived design, either historically or in thefuture. Natural processes achieve their results in real time, throughself-interaction. Our minds struggle to grasp how this can happen. Leonardo daVinci marveled, “Human subtlety will never devise an invention more beautiful,more simple or more direct than does Nature, because in her inventions nothingis lacking, and nothing is superfluous.” In essence, Nature is all aboutfeedback loops. While our genes set the stage, we determine the character weplay on that stage and choose the characters with whom we will interact. And, inreturn, the set on the stage adapts to us. We are modifying our genes with ourwords, actions, and deeds all the time. This feedback system has been thecornerstone of evolution and always will be.MYSTERIOUS INHERITANCEAt a certain point, it seems totally arbitrary, conceited, and human-centric forhuman beings to claim the mind as our private domain. The notion that Naturemindlessly created our own mind doesn’t, at bottom, make much sense. Theingrained cleverness of evolution’s stratagems is astonishing, even in so-calledlower life-forms. For example, gene-based changes in survival can take place bysimple thievery. Take the case of the brilliant emerald-green sea slug Elysiachlorotica, which looks remarkably like a plant. When it’s time to eat, the slugswipes chloroplasts—cellular machines that can perform photosynthesis—fromnearby algae to produce food for itself, the way a plant does, making sugar fromwater, chlorophyll, and sunlight.This interesting case of chloroplast burglary has been known for decades, butmore recently it’s been discovered that the crafty sea slug can also steal wholegenes from the algae. These allow it to make its own food. Normally the stolenchloroplasts last only so long, but the genes the sea slug steals and binds ontoits genome keep them going strong, producing meals far longer. It’s astonishingthat an animal can feed itself like a plant through cross-species thievery ofgenes.Something similar pertains to our species, too. Scientists used to believe thatall the cells in our body contain identical genomes. But we are now finding thatmore than one genome can be found in the nucleus of a single human cell. Morespecifically, some people have been found with groups of cells that containmultiple gene mutations occurring nowhere else in their body. This can happenwhen the genomes of two different eggs fuse together into one egg. A pregnantmother can even gain new genomes in her cells from her child, who leaves fetalcells behind after birth. These cells can migrate to the mother’s organs, eventhe brain, and be absorbed. This event is known as mosaicism, and it looks to befar more common than ever imagined. In some cases, mosaicism is believed tocontribute to diseases like schizophrenia, but for the most part it isconsidered benign.Even among Darwinian strongholds, it’s become obvious that evolution is acomplex dance between hard and soft inheritance. For example, sexualreproduction in most species is hardwired. A male fruit fly automatically knowsthat in order to mate, it must find a suitable female, tap her with hisforelegs, sing specific songs, vibrate one wing, and lick her genitalia. No onehas to teach this to the fruit fly. Every gesture is genetically hardwired, andthe program is evolutionarily very old. But at some point long ago, thesebehaviors were not yet wired in; they had to evolve. Each choreographedcomponent of the mating ritual individually emerged in some ancestral fruit flymale and then began to spread. Eventually the new trait became so successfulthat mating couldn’t take place without it. At that point, we call the ingrainedbehavior “instinctive,” “hardwired,” or “genetically determined.”In other words, the behavior occurs with no thought necessary. It arises inresponse to a specific stimulus. A cockroach will automatically scurry away andhide when a light is switched on. A lizard will scamper off when a person’sshadow approaches. A squirrel will enlarge its tail to appear bigger when facingan attacker. These innate behaviors have become automatic to ensure survival.But it goes too far to claim, as evolutionary psychologists do, that humanbehavior is primarily a matter of survival.This claim is an attempt to make us seem hardwired like fruit flies,cockroaches, and squirrels. Certainly we’ve inherited mechanisms from ourmammalian ancestors that are innate—the fight-or-flight response is the mostobvious example. But we can override our ancestral inheritance at will, which iswhy, for example, firemen don’t run away from a blazing inferno but toward it,or why soldiers on the battlefield will rush in under heavy fire to save afallen comrade. Mind trumps instinct through choice and free will. In the sameway—and this is the idea that outrages mainstream geneticists—mind trumps genesas well.Is there a survival benefit to art, music, love, truth, philosophy, mathematics,compassion, charity, and almost every other trait that makes us fully human? Arethese traits acquired genetically? Elaborate scenarios are devised every day byevolutionary psychologists who insist that they can show why love, for example,is just a survival skill or a tactic that evolved to make mating more possible.Every other trait is “explained” in similar fashion for solely one purpose—topreserve at all cost Darwin’s original scheme.What’s anathema is any admission that Homo sapiens evolved using the mind,sidestepping genes altogether. Yet at a certain point it’s obvious that wepursue music because it’s beautiful, practice compassion because our hearts aretouched, and so on. In some way these behaviors are inherited, but no one knowshow. The existence of mind as a driving force is just as good an explanation asany, and often much better. It’s entirely possible that we “download” many ofthe cherished traits that make us human, not by evolving the tiny gestures thatgo into a fruit fly’s mating ritual, but by taking the whole thing at once.For example, one hears of a child prodigy who has never had a music lesson andyet instinctively knows how to play an instrument as a toddler. The greatArgentinean pianist Martha Argerich relates just such a tale.> I was at the kindergarten in a competitive program when I was two years and> eight months. I was much younger than the rest of the children. I had a little> friend who was always teasing me; he was five and was always telling me, “You> can’t do this, you can’t do that.” And I would always do whatever he said I> couldn’t.> > Once he got the idea of telling me I couldn’t play the piano. (Laughter)> That’s how it started. I still remember it. I immediately got up, went to the> piano, and started playing a tune that the teacher was playing all the time. I> played the tune by ear and perfectly. The teacher immediately called my mother> and they started making a fuss. And it was all because of this boy who said,> “You can’t play the piano.”It’s impossible to know whether Argerich simply inherited either the genes orthe epigenetic marks that were responsible for her amazing gift. There areinherited skills. Babies are born with the grasping reflex that allows them toclutch at the breast. They have a sense of balance, and some rudimentary butpowerful reflexes for survival. For example, experiments have been done withbabies only a few months old in which they are placed on a table while theirmothers, standing a few feet away, encourage them to come closer. When theinfants approach the edge of the table, they won’t go past it; they reflexivelyknow that going over the edge means that they will fall. (There is actually aglass extension to the table, so the experiment is perfectly safe.) Because theywant to be with their mothers, the babies start to cry in distress, but nomatter how coaxing the mother is, her offspring obeys its innate instinct.But music is a complex skill involving the higher brain, and unlike a simplereflex, much information must be learned, organized, and stored. How can it bethat music prodigies, of which there have been many, somehow inherit a complexmental skill? No one knows, but it argues powerfully for mind being crucial toevolution, since evolution is entirely about inheritance. To deepen our sense ofmystery, take the case of Jay Greenberg, a musical prodigy who ranks with thegreatest in history, such as Mozart. The first time Jay saw a child-size celloat age two, he took it and started playing. By age ten he entered the JuilliardSchool with the intention of being a composer, and by his mid-teens Sony hadreleased a CD of his Symphony No. 5, played by the London Symphony, and hisString Quintet, played by the Juilliard String Quartet.As for his working methods, Jay, like many other prodigies, says that he hearsthe music in his head and writes it down as dictation (Mozart also had thisability, although there is a process of refinement and creativity that goesalong with it); perhaps unique to Jay, he can see or hear simultaneous scores inhis head at the same time. “My unconscious directs my conscious mind at a mile aminute,” he told a 60 Minutes interviewer.Prodigies cause amazement, but the whole issue of instinct and genetic memory isan incredibly interesting evolutionary concept. A flatworm can be trained toavoid a light by subjecting it to electric shock whenever it sees it. If theflatworm is then cut in half and the end with the head grows a new tail, or thetail end grows a new head, both halves will continue to avoid the light. Howdoes a newly generated brain retain the same memories as the old one—is memoryin this case stored in the DNA of the worm? It’s an open question how our owninstinctive behaviors became encoded as memories in our DNA. We have yet todiscover how long it took for them to be automatically programmed in us.More interesting, we can ponder which of our behaviors not currently programmedor automatic in us right now might become so in the far future. We don’t know.But when identical stem cells can become any of two hundred differentspecialized cells in the body, it is epigenetics and coordinated gene activitiesthat are at play. The highly orchestrated symphonies of gene networks areinnate, and they give us the beginning of an answer about how complex skills canbe “downloaded” intact. We can’t even be sure that inheritance is the correctterm, given that musical and mathematical prodigies, like genius in general, arejust as likely to appear in families with no background in music, math, or highIQs.YOUR MIND, YOUR EVOLUTIONThe purpose of this chapter has been to open new possibilities for you as aperson who wants to gain control over your own well-being. We needed to discussevolution in detail so that you may realize how much control you actually have.Evolving in real time is possible. Let’s review why.Mutations aren’t always random but may also be induced by the environment andinteractions.Evolutionary change doesn’t need millions of years—it can occur in a singlegeneration (at least in mice and other species).Genes operate by feedback loops that constantly monitor for new messages,information, and changes in the environment.The brain constantly interacts with the genome, bringing in the vast potentialof the mind to affect every cell in the body.These four points are the takeaway from this chapter, and they pave the way forthe transformation that the super genome facilitates. They also pave the way fortransforming our whole notion of how evolution works. You don’t need to beconcerned with where genetics winds up a generation from now. At the presentmoment, you have enough knowledge to do something incredibly important—you cancooperate with Nature’s infinite creativity.Evolution, after all, is only a scientific word for the creativity andorganizing factors that drive the entire universe, but most especially life onEarth. The super genome records every creative leap that life has taken. Untilthe appearance of human beings, creatures lacked the self-awareness to examinetheir evolutionary state. A flatworm that is cut in half and forms a new braincontaining its old memories has no idea that this enigmatic event has occurred.But you can use your awareness to direct where your life is going. The supergenome will always respond, so even in the absence of rock-solid data, wepropose the following possibilities:Your intentions have a powerful effect on your genome.If you set a goal, your genes will self-organize around your desire and supportit.Creativity is your natural state—you only need to tap into it.You were put here to evolve, and the super genome was put here for the samepurpose.Keeping these conclusions in mind is important, because the environmentcontinues to press new challenges on our genes. Unlike our ancestors, who had tomeet pressures from weather and predators, many of these new stresses areunfortunately of our own making: global climate change, increasing pollution,artificially created GMO foods, antibiotic-resistant microbes, increasinglytoxic pesticides, and contaminated food and water supplies. We all need to beginarming our genomes to ensure the survival of our species. In other words, wearen’t only responsible for our personal health and longevity, which relates toone super genome. The real super genome is planetary, and how you evolve hasglobal implications. We don’t pose this as an anxiety-provoking responsibility,but a fascinating challenge. If and when humanity solves these new challenges,it will take a quantum leap in evolution, which is exactly how it has alwaysbeen and should be."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUETHE REAL YOUIf you’ve ever watched a television show on the Big Bang or a future mannedvoyage to Mars, you’ll recognize a standard moment. Someone stands outsidegazing at the night sky and murmurs about what a tiny speck the Earth is in thevastness of creation. We wish that for every moment like this, equal time shouldbe given to William Blake and what he once wrote: “To see a World in a grain ofsand, / And a Heaven in a wild flower, / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,/ And Eternity in an hour….” No one has summarized the story of genetics sosuccinctly or so beautifully.A microscopic speck of DNA is the closest we can come to seeing the worldcompressed into a grain of sand. It defies imagination how Nature devised such ascheme. But it did, and here you are, the expression of that world and themillions of years of evolution that has taken place there. DNA compresses life,time, and space into the same speck. If you reflect on it, this changeseverything you know about yourself. At this very moment, you merge with the flowof life as a whole.The real you isn’t bound by limitations, any more than DNA is. How old are you?At the everyday level, you’d count the candles on your last birthday cake. Butthis excludes the 90 to 100 trillion micro-organisms that are the largestbiological part of “you.” Single cells can only reproduce by division. Oneamoeba divides in two, but the two new amoebas aren’t its children. They arestill itself. In a very real sense, all the amoebas alive today are the firstamoeba with select changes in its genome. And, the same goes for all thetrillions of micro-organisms that occupy your body and are necessary for it tosurvive.Who’s the real you? It’s the identity you choose to take on. Once you startlooking at yourself this way, the individual gradually vanishes. An enlightenedIndian sage once told a disciple, “The difference between us can’t be seen onthe surface. We are two people sitting in a small room waiting for our dinner.But there is still a great difference, because when you look around, you see thewalls of this room. When I look around, I see infinity in all directions.” IfDNA could speak, it would say much the same thing. Time and space are unbounded,and so is the force of evolution that wears human DNA as its crown jewel.As “you” expand beyond, more and more boundaries can be shed as uselesslimitations. Since the entire mass of animal and plant life on Earth traces backto single-cell creatures, “you” are one enormous 3.5-billion-year-old being.Separation in space makes each of us think we are individuals. And we are. Butthe continuum of time at the cellular scale reveals an equal reality: we areunited as a single biological being. The human qualities of “you”—awareness,intelligence, creativity, the drive to get more out of life—have a universalsource. As we saw, the essentials of human life are present in every cell of thebody.“You” seem to inhabit your body as a life support system of considerablefragility. But even this limit is a matter of what you choose to identify with,the part or the whole. There is no atom in your body that did not derive fromsomething eaten, drunk, or breathed from the substance of the planet. Whether wetalk about the “you” that is sitting in a chair reading this sentence or the“you” that is a single enormous 3.5-billion-year-old being, neither lives on theplanet—they are the planet. Your living body is the self-organization of thesubstance of the Earth itself—minerals, water, and air—into zillions oflife-forms. Earth plays Scrabble, forming different words as the genetic lettersare recombined. Some words, like human, run away to live on their own,forgetting who owns the game.If “you” are a recreational pastime for the planet, what does it have in mindfor its next move? Games involve a lot of repetition, but there has to benovelty as well, with records to break and highest scores to shatter. “You” hasits choice of playing fields. At one level, the Mars probe named Curiosity canbe viewed as a separate human achievement, and a very complex one. It involvedskilled, clever engineers and scientists who figured out how to make a robot,propel it to another world, have it land, and then send information back to us.But there’s another way of looking at it. Just as reasonably, logically, andscientifically, our living planet is reaching out to touch its neighbor.The planet has been patient in this endeavor. While “you,” sharply focused onthe separate self, were busy discovering fire, inventing agriculture, writingsacred texts, making war, having sex, and other survival stratagems, Earth mayalready have dreamed of tapping Mars on the shoulder. (Rudy is on a task forcenow aimed at protecting the brains of astronauts from cosmic radiation en routeto Mars.) If this image strikes you as fanciful, look at the activity of yourbrain. You are conscious of having a purpose in mind when you walk, talk, work,and love. But it is undeniable that many brain activities are unconscious, whilethe activity of the brain as a whole is totally unknown. Whatever makes theEarth a totality makes your brain a totality. Therefore it isn’t fanciful tothink of the Earth as moving in a coherent, unified direction, just as yourbrain has from the moment you were born.Or to put it in a word, if you (as a person) have a purpose, then you (as lifeon Earth) have a purpose. Perhaps even Earth, as a collection of diversespecies, just as we are a collection of microbes and mammalian cells, has apurpose in the solar system, and the solar system in the galaxy, and onward tothe universe. Do we, as a species, serve a specific function on Earth, in itscapacity as a “being” in the universe? Perhaps we are the immune system of ourdear planet. Why? The only natural predator that can turn our planet into alifeless rock is a giant comet or asteroid. We are the only species on Earththat can predict such an event and have a chance to prevent it. And, like ourown immune system, we need it but can also be harmed by it when it goes out ofwhack—for example, in inflammation and autoimmune disease. These relationshipsfrom cells to human, to Earth and beyond, are seamless, even if it suits ourpride to stand above and perceive ourselves as entirely separate from oursurroundings.The super genome isn’t the end of the story. It’s a work in progress. But at thevery least it has stitched “you” and all of us into the tapestry of all life andthe universe. In an ideal world, this would be enough to save the planet. Inhealing the environment, “you” would be saving it from destruction. The signsaren’t very promising so far. We hope, by offering this book, that the supergenome will point more people in the right direction—taking responsibility forour genome and the planet. One thing is certain. Human evolution is mindful, andall that remains is to decide which way its mind will turn—hopefully, it will betoward the light."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXESWe’ve been describing some exciting science in general terms suitable for layreaders. But some readers will have a deeper interest in the underlyinggenetics. For them, here’s some in-depth information about mutations andepigenetic alterations, because the latter are so crucial in pointing the waytoward future breakthroughs. In particular, we want to address the commonconcern over whether “bad genes” destine a person to acquire specific diseases.The answer isn’t nearly so simple. But the best clues connecting complexdiseases to your genes are based on the science we’ve been covering. The threadconnecting epigenetics and inflammation appears to lead in many directions. Itcould be the most exciting medical development in decades. Like your genes,inflammation is double edged. Medical science is now unraveling how mechanismsthat benefit the body in so many crucial ways somehow can turn on the body andcreate enormous problems.These appendixes are devoted to exploring such mysteries."},{"pageContent":"GENETIC CLUES FOR COMPLEX DISEASESOne result of the advances in genetic technology brought on by the Human GenomeProject was next-generation sequencing, which can decipher huge stretches of thegenome in short order, so that we can now objectively scan the entire humangenome of a patient to find causative mutations underlying their particulardisorder. Then it was discovered, as we mentioned before, that for most commondiseases with a genetic component, only about 5 percent of the gene mutationsassociated with the disease are sufficient to cause it. These “fully penetrant”mutations, once inherited, guarantee the disease. (They are also calledMendelian gene mutations, after the famed pea-growing monk Gregor Mendel, thefather of genetics.)In fact, the first Alzheimer’s disease genes that Rudy and others discovered inthe late 1980s and 1990s contained such mutations. However, in 95 percent ofinherited diseases, variations in the DNA of numerous genes (variants) conspirewith one another to ultimately determine someone’s risk for disease, adding inlifestyle habits and experience. These variants in the DNA are classified asgenetic risk factors. While some increase risk, others can protect us fromdisease. In the majority of cases, however, the outcome depends on environmentalexposure and lifestyle.For a specific individual, discovering exactly how much contribution is beingmade genetically involves a huge amount of detective work, scouring multiplegene variations at once and comparing the results to the patient’s familyhistory, life experiences, and environmental exposures. So despite theconsiderable success among gene hunters like Rudy and his team, for manydisorders—for example, schizophrenia, obesity, bipolar disease, and breastcancer—the gene variants associated with the disease have to date accounted forless than 20 percent of the variance underlying risk.For most complex diseases, it is now realized, there’s an interplay of natureand nurture. In this interplay, the influence of epigenetic factors assumes amajor role. Epigenetics mechanisms have already been linked to many diseases,including the childhood disorders Rett syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, andAngelman syndrome. In some cases, gene activity is turned off directly bymethylation of the bases of DNA in the gene itself. In other cases, chemicalmodifications (methylation and acetylation) are made to the histone proteinsthat bind the DNA in order to silence the gene.But the picture has become still more complicated. Now that we can sequencewhole genomes, we are finding that each of us carries up to 300 mutations thatlead to the loss of function of specific genes as well as up to 100 variantsthat have been associated with risk for certain diseases. Moreover, somemutations and DNA variants influencing risk weren’t present in the genomes ofour parents but occurred anew in the sperm or egg. These are called de novo, ornovel, mutations. Novel mutations can occur in the sperm and the egg that joinedto form your embryo. Such mutations occur 1.2 times every 100,000,000 bases inthe two sets of 3 billion DNA bases you inherited from your parents.That means you harbor in your genome roughly 72 de novo mutations that yourparents don’t carry in their genomes. (The actual rate of de novo mutation isheavily dependent on the father’s age when the baby is conceived. Every sixteenyears after the age of thirty, the number of mutations in paternal spermdoubles, which has been shown to contribute to the risk for diseases such asautism.)In addition to single-base variants in your DNA, you carry large duplications,deletions, inversions, and rearrangements of up to millions of bases ofDNA—these are known as structural variants (SVs). Like the single-base variants(technically notated as SNV, for single-nucleotide variant), structural DNAdisruptions can either be inherited from your parents or occur as de novomutations. In Alzheimer’s disease, a duplication of the APP (amyloid precursorprotein) gene, the first Alzheimer’s gene to be discovered, inevitably leads toearly-onset (under age sixty) dementia.SVs and SNVs can both be found by next-generation DNA sequencing. But in anothertype of genetic analysis, gene expression (or gene activity) can be assessedacross the entire genome. This is called transcriptome analysis. When a genemakes a protein, it first makes an RNA transcript that will be used to guide thesynthesis of the protein. Transcriptome analysis can be used as part of testingfor epigenetic regulation of genes, since it provides information about geneactivity, not the sequence of the DNA.The point is that powerful tools are now available to unravel the complexity ofmost diseases that have a genetic component. One issue is that the way a complexdisease progresses is by a series of steps connected to one another. In everydaylife, when you catch a cold, you first notice a mild symptom like a scratchythroat, and unless you catch the cold at this very early stage (by taking zinctablets, for instance), you know from experience that a chain of symptoms willfollow. Something similar is involved in genetics. Genetic studies usingtranscriptome analysis and whole-genome sequencing together carry out “pathwayanalysis,” which looks at many genes involved with a disease at once. With thisinformation, the aim is to understand the pathological mechanisms by which thedisease is caused and progresses. Specific biological pathways—for example,inflammation or wound healing—influence the risk for disease. Pathway analysisalso elucidates other new genes of interest that might be involved in thedisease, based on the biological pathways implicated. For example, in Rudy’sstudies of Alzheimer’s disease, pathway analyses of the risk genes that he andothers discovered have implicated a major role for the immune system andinflammation. When it comes to human disease, whether it’s cancer, diabetes,heart disease, or Alzheimer’s, to name a few, inflammation is almost always thekiller that takes the patient out. If you wanted to name the epigenetic changethat plays the biggest role in modulating a biological process, it wouldprobably be inflammation.TYPE 2 DIABETESClose to 400 million people worldwide suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D), anumber that’s expected to grow to well over 500 million in the next twentyyears. In T2D patients, plasma glucose (or blood sugar) levels are elevated,often later in life as a consequence of both genetics and lifestyle choices,particularly diet. A major risk factor is obesity. One often sees clustering ofdiabetes in families, and while this would normally implicate gene mutationsthat run in the family, the family members also tend to eat together, sharingthe same diet and probably similar eating habits.Risk has become more precise but not necessarily simpler. In T2D, dozens ofgenes are already known to be associated with risk for adult onset. (Notsurprisingly, many of these genes have also been associated with obesity andaltered glucose levels.) However, most of the DNA variants in the implicatedgenes exert only small effects on lifelong risk for the disease. Lifestyle isprobably most of the story, which you now know means that epigenetics is atwork. Some of the strongest evidence for this comes from findings that aperson’s early diet and nutrition in childhood determine later life risk fordiabetes and heart disease. The Pima Indian population in Arizona is heavilyaffected by T2D and obesity. If a Pima mother was suffering from T2D whilepregnant, the children turn out to be highly prone to both T2D and obesity.The science tying epigenetics to complex disease is emerging at a frenetic pace.We now have gene chip technologies that can search through half a million sitesin the genome to find where methylation may be turning off the activity of anyof our 23,000 genes. These sites can be scanned for specific diseases likediabetes to ask exactly which genes are being switched. These epigenome-wideassociation studies, as they are called, are now being carried out around theworld for all the most common disorders. In the case of T2D, some of thegreatest epigenetic modifications were found around a gene called FTO, which hasbeen linked to obesity and body mass index, which measures the ratio of fat inoverall weight.Another factor contributing to risk for diabetes is birth weight. It turns outthat future risk for diabetes is highest in babies born with either low or highbirth weights. Epigenetic effects on the genome of low-birth-weight babies canbegin in the uterus. For high-birth-weight babies, the issue seems to beexposure to diabetes in the mother during pregnancy. All in all, the risk forT2D almost certainly involves a combination of genes, lifestyle, and epigeneticsin which all these factors interplay. The same model is likely to apply for mostcomplex diseases, from metabolic disorders to addictions and psychoses.ALZHEIMER’S DISEASEA field of study that has long been close to Rudy’s heart is Alzheimer’sdisease. In 2015 a comprehensive analysis of the role of epigenetics inAlzheimer’s was reported in the journal Nature, and the results were striking.Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used mice alteredwith a human gene that caused them to undergo nerve cell loss, orneurodegeneration. This kind of nerve cell death is similar to what happens inthe brain of a patient in the final stages of Alzheimer’s, which basically robsone of oneself.As nerve cells started to die in the brains of the mice, the investigatorslooked for accompanying changes in the epigenome. As rampant neurodegenerationtook over the brain, genes in two major categories were found to carryepigenetic marks. These included genes involved in neuroplasticity and therewiring of neural networks—crucial to the brain’s ability to renew itself—alongwith other genes involved with the brain’s immune system. The brain’s immunesystem uses inflammation to protect the brain, often at the expense of nervecells, which die in the wake of unbridled inflammation.In the latter case, cells known as microglia, which normally support and cleanup after nerve cells, sense the surrounding massacre and assume, mistakenly,that the brain is under attack by bacteria or viruses. Consequently, thehyped-up microglial cells start shooting free radicals (oxygen-based bullets) tokill the foreign invaders. In the process, they kill many more nerve cells as asort of collateral damage in battle.The MIT team then compared the epigenomic signature of the brains of the alteredmice to the autopsied brains of Alzheimer’s patients who had succumbed to thedisease. Uncanny matches were observed. (These findings were later extended toepigenetic marks in patients currently suffering from the disease.) Starting in2008, Rudy’s group and others were increasingly finding newAlzheimer’s-associated genes functioning as part of the brain’s immune system,carrying mutations that predispose to inflammation. When the results of Rudy’sAlzheimer’s Genome Project were combined with the MIT group’s data, the messagewas loud and clear: Alzheimer’s is essentially an immune disease driven by theinterplay of immune gene mutations and lifestyle, ultimately culminating inepigenetic alterations of those same immune genes.An entirely new paradigm for the cause and progression of Alzheimer’s diseasewas being born. Rudy’s team and others are still trying to figure out how to“chill out” the brain’s immune system as a way to prevent and treat the disease.The answers will undoubtedly lie in the way immune genes are orchestrated todeal with the onslaught of neurodegeneration in the brain.SLEEP AND ALZHEIMER’SWe’d like to address the intriguing trail of clues that solved one of the chiefmysteries behind Alzheimer’s disease. As it turns out, sleep was one of the mainclues. Disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle have been associated with numerousneurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. Science isarriving at a pretty good idea of how sleep is linked to Alzheimer’s. We nowknow that the disorder is initiated by the excessive accumulation in the brainof a small protein called beta-amyloid, written variously as β-amyloid andamyloid-β (Aβ), which was not always obvious. When Rudy was a student in themid-eighties, he and others in the field had maintained that Alzheimer’s isinitiated by brain amyloid deposits. In 1986, Rudy and others discovered thegene (APP) that makes Aβ (this also turned out to be the first Alzheimer’sgene), and twenty-eight years later he and his colleagues developed the firstmodel of Alzheimer’s pathology in a laboratory petri dish by growing brain nervecells in an artificial brain-like environment. In that study, Rudy andcolleagues Doo Yeon Kim, Se Hoon Choi, and Dora Kovacs were able for the firsttime to fully recapitulate the senile (amyloid) plaques and tangles inside thenerve cells that litter the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. The study earned theteam a highly prestigious Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award in 2015.The creation of “Alzheimer’s-in-a-dish,” as the New York Times dubbed it whenthey reported on the scientific paper in Nature announcing the achievement,settled a thirty-year debate.* That debate, in fact, had been the biggest in theAlzheimer’s field. The debate was over whether excessive amounts of amyloidsurrounding the outside of affected brain cells was the actual cause of formingtangles inside the cells, leading to their death. (Tangles are an abnormalaggregate of proteins inside a brain cell that serve as a critical marker forAlzheimer’s.) The new study provided the first convincing evidence thatβ-amyloid can trigger all the subsequent pathology leading to nerve cell deathand Alzheimer’s dementia.Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people, andsufferers frequently experience major sleep problems. While these sleepdisturbances were once dismissed as a simple consequence of the disease, we knowthey occur early on and may actually help cause Alzheimer’s. Considerableevidence indicates that the sleep/wake cycle is tightly linked to the productionof β-amyloid in the brains of humans and mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Asshown by Rudy’s colleague David Holtzman at Washington University in St. Louis,more amyloid is produced at higher levels in the brain when we are awake andnerve cells are more active. At night, particularly during deep sleep (slow-wavesleep), amyloid production is turned way down. Some other useful things happenin the brain during deep sleep. First, it is believed by some scientists thatduring deep sleep, short-term memories are consolidated into long-term memories,rather like downloading data from your thumb drive to your hard drive. Second,with regard to Alzheimer’s, not only is β-amyloid production turned down duringdeep sleep, but this is also the time when the brain literally cleans itselfout. It produces more fluid around brain cells, which serves to flush out thebulk of metabolites and protein debris like β-amyloid. This waste-clearancepathway is referred to as the brain’s glymphatic system, resembling what thebody’s lymphatic system does but employing the brain’s glial cells rather thanlymph cells. So not only do you get a break from β-amyloid formation as nervecell activity slows down during deep sleep, but you also clear it out of thebrain. Meanwhile, humans or mice that are sleep deprived—a major stressor—makemuch more β-amyloid and show evidence of elevated nerve cell injury and eventangle pathology. Given that β-amyloid and tangles drive nerve cell death inAlzheimer’s disease, there is now an added reason to get eight hours of sleepevery night and avoid the stress placed on your system by sleep deprivation.Good sleep is promising as one of the best ways to potentially lower your riskfor Alzheimer’s. It’s also possible that improving the quality and duration ofsleep in Alzheimer’s patients could help them. While we do not yet understandexactly how sleep cleans out the brain at the level of our genes, attending toyour own sleep helps reduce the anxiety provoked by this terrible disease.BREAST CANCERAnother disease with complex patterns for risk is breast cancer. Researchers atUniversity College London have revealed much of the epigenetic signature forbreast cancer by studying healthy women who later went on to get breast cancer,with or without the presence of a mutation in the BRCA1 (pronounced “bra-ca 1”)gene. BRCA1 mutations are responsible for about 10 percent of breast cancers,leaving the other 90 percent largely a mystery. The question is, how much“missing heritability” is epigenetic? It turned out that the epigeneticalterations involved were pretty similar in both groups of women; in otherwords, the alterations were independent of inheriting the BRCA1 gene mutation.If the disease’s epigenetic signature is known, it can eventually be used topredict who is on the way to getting breast cancer before it strikes, a majoradvance given that every year 250,000 women get the disease, and 40,000 die fromit.The fact that epigenetics has such an apparently strong effect on risk means wemust deeply consider lifestyle changes, beginning with diet. Among nutrients andsupplements that have been validated to help reduce the risk for breast cancerare aspirin, coffee, green tea, and vitamin D.In the case of aspirin, the best data come from a 30-year study that followed130,000 people. Those who regularly took aspirin (at least two 325-milligramaspirin tablets per week) had a decrease in gastrointestinal cancer of 20percent and a decrease in colorectal cancer of 25 percent. The results for thesespecific cancers don’t apply across the board to cancer in general, and it took16 years of taking aspirin for the benefit to appear. If people stopped takingaspirin for 3 or 4 years, their advantage disappeared. The reason aspirin worksagainst cancer, so far as is known, is connected to its anti-inflammatory effect(no surprise) and its apparent ability to decrease the formation of new cancercells.HEART DISEASEIn heart disease, we also know that gene mutations and lifestyle work togetherto determine risk, but as in diabetes and breast cancer, so do epigeneticmodifications (methylation) that silence certain genes. In one study it wasfound that levels of two blood fats (triglycerides and very-low-densitylipoprotein [VLDL] cholesterol) were tied to methylation of a gene calledcarnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A). This gene makes an enzyme needed tobreak down fats. When it is turned off by epigenetic mechanisms, instead offatty acids in the body being converted into energy, they stay around in thebloodstream, increasing the risk for heart disease. Methylation of the CPT1Agene is affected by diet, alcohol, and smoking.ALCOHOL AND GENESEven alcohol dependence is affected by epigenetic events. Alcoholism takes adevastating toll on the victims as well as their families, contributing to 1 in30 deaths worldwide. The best-known genes associated with alcohol dependence arealcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both make enzymesthat help break down alcohol in the body. But variations in these genes explainonly a minor degree of the inheritability of alcoholism. The “missingheritability” likely lies in epigenetic changes that are tied to the rewardcenters of the brain, the source of feeling good when you take a drink.Now we know that these reward centers actually undergo changes in gene activityfollowing the intake of alcohol. This means that different people will respondto alcohol consumption in different ways, depending on their gene activities. Inheavy drinkers, an amino acid called homocysteine may go up, ultimately leadingto methylation changes that silence specific genes. Such gene activities cantrigger a vicious circle in which the response to pleasure and pain is altered,leading to an increased craving for alcohol to deliver less and less pleasure.MENTAL ILLNESSEpigenetic modifications can also be tied to psychiatric disorders likeschizophrenia and bipolar disease. Finding the inherited gene mutations thatlead to these illnesses has so far met with only limited success. This impasseonce again leaves a potentially significant role for epigenetics in helping tofill in the missing heritability and the role of lifestyle. Increasing evidenceshows that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may not be guaranteed by, orsolely dependent on, gene mutations that are passed on from parent to child.Suspected culprits in someone’s lifestyle include diet, chemical toxins, andchild rearing that affects epigenetic modifications. A patient’s lifestyle candetermine epigenetic marks acquired since birth, but mouse studies would suggestthat other epigenetic marks may be inherited. These marks presumably would ariseas a result of the lifestyles of the parents or even grandparents. (Please notethat we aren’t suggesting blame. The epigenetics of mental illness are quitetentative and incomplete. No one has yet connected A to B for any lifestylechoice that may be implicated in mental disorders.)Epigenome-wide studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have revealedepigenetic marks on some predictable genes, such as those involved with makingcertain neurochemicals previously associated with psychosis. But others wereless predictable. For example, key genes required for immunity have turned up inboth schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting that the immune system maybe somehow related to a susceptibility to these disorders. Of course, here andin other epigenetic signatures associated with risk, cause and effect are anissue. How do we know whether the epigenetic marks occurred previous to onset(cause) or as a result of the disease (effect)? For now, it’s safe to say thatepigenomic tests for specific diseases will become invaluable in every aspect ofpreventing and treating complex diseases, from prevention to ultimate cure.In fact, we are tremendously optimistic about where genetics is leading, but weare realists, too. There remains a sharp divide between two domains, the visibleand the invisible. All of us live in both domains, a fact that can’t be ignored.Peering through a microscope, a cell biologist can witness myriad changes in howa cell is functioning, yet the most crucial component, the experience thatguides these changes, cannot be observed. The nonphysical is playing its partduring every second of a person’s life, and we believe it’s the prime reason whygenetics must look beyond materialism and random chance.The data will have to support such a radical change in perspective, but far moreimportant is to formulate the ideas that the data must fit—that’s our objectivein this book, and we’ve taken some giant steps in that direction. You now knowmore about the dynamic nature of your genome than geneticists knew even twentyor thirty years ago. What’s most crucial, however, is applying the knowledge tooptimize your genetic activity. Before we can do that, another big chunk ofgenetic information needs to be presented, and it comes from a very surprisingsource that no one ever anticipated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* The Alzheimer’s-in-a-dish study was made possible by a very forward-lookingfoundation, the Cure Alzheimer’s Fund."},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT PARADOX OF DNAEpigenetics is a complex subject, and in reading this book you’ve grasped themain concept: that gene expression is switched on and off and up and down basedon the choices you make every day and the resulting experiences that create whoyou are. This switching, which leads to trillions and trillions of possiblecombinations, is how everyday experience is transmitted to the cells of yourbody. But immediately a troubling problem arises. Why are some experiences sodamaging to the body? Why isn’t DNA designed to preserve life as its onlymission?This is the great paradox of DNA, and it forms the next link in our story. DNAmakes life possible, but at the same time it has the potential for ruinous,life-destroying actions. DNA is like a bomb that knows how to defuse itself andalso how to set off an explosion. Which one will it choose? Why should the codeof life be employed to create death? That’s the heart of the paradox. In all ofus there are genes for developing cancer (pre-oncogenes) and opposite genes forfighting cancer (tumor-suppressing genes). This seems inexplicable until yourealize that DNA reflects every aspect of existence.Instead of choosing sides, DNA joins all sides, encompassing all possibilities.A virus or bacterium that can make you sick has its own genetic signature, whichit does everything to keep intact, and so do the immune cells in your body thatwar against viruses and bacteria. When new cells are born, they inherit agenetic program for their death. In effect, DNA is staging a drama in which itplays the role of hero and villain, attacker and defender, keeper of life anddestroyer of life.The challenge is to make choices that activate the life-supporting side of DNA.By now you’ve seen that we’ve taken big steps in that direction. You’ve startedto view life from the perspective of a cell. A cell senses its environment andmakes adaptations that best serve its own survival. But it also does this usingthe least possible energy to maintain balance and serve its neighboring cellsand the whole body. Failure to do so can lead to cancer or other diseases thatcan potentially kill the host and the cell along with it. So every cellnaturally knows exactly what to do in all situations working in perfect harmonywith its genes. Our hope is that we can do the same as human beings.The latest research into a wide range of disorders, including heart disease,autism, schizophrenia, obesity, and Alzheimer’s, suggests that there areindicators for each disease that extend back decades in a person’s life, even toearly infancy. This came as a startling discovery, because it runs contrary toour conventional notion of how we get sick. We tend to believe that getting sickfollows the pattern of the common cold. You are sitting on a plane next tosomeone who is sneezing and coughing. Three days later you catch that person’scold. There is a simple cause-and-effect, along with a definite starting pointof infection.Many acute illnesses do in fact follow this pattern, but it turns out thatchronic disease doesn’t, and chronic disorders are the major causes of mortalityin modern society. How do you organize a prevention program for a disorderdecades before symptoms appear? A perplexing example of this dilemma actuallyshowed up in the Korean War, when autopsies were performed on the bodies ofyoung soldiers killed in battle. Males in their early twenties exhibited thefatty plaque in their coronary arteries that are the major cause of heartattacks. How did men so young have this much plaque, often enough to cause worryabout an impending heart attack? There was no medical answer, and even today,the genesis of arterial plaque remains to be explained. Just as baffling, whydidn’t these men suffer heart attacks at a young age, since the onset ofpremature heart attacks typically begins at forty? Even without satisfactoryanswers, here was an early clue, going back to the fifties, that chronic diseasepredates the arrival of symptoms by many years and has no definite beginningexcept at a microscopic level.But there’s also a very hopeful side to the mystery. These early indicators holdout the best chance for preventing and curing chronic illness, because wheneverthe body goes out of balance, the earlier it’s caught, the easier it is totreat. Millions of people follow this principle when they take zinc tablets atthe first sign of a cold or aspirin at the first hint of a headache. The sameprinciple can be pushed back even further, which is why vaccines are effective.They give the body an advance defense against polio, measles, or this year’s flubefore the disease has had a chance to develop.In effect, a vaccine is teaching the body’s intelligence something new. The bodylistens (i.e., the genes respond in a new way) and learns from the newexperience. “This is what measles looks like. Arm yourself.” There’s never goingto be a universal vaccine for all human ills (even current vaccines have theircritics and problems). Instead, we are proposing a new model for self-care; atthe heart of this model is a revolutionary way of relating to your genes.This shift in thinking agrees with every advanced trend in medicine, but thegeneral public hasn’t absorbed as yet how radical the change will be. A new erain well-being is at hand, looking to the body’s intelligence as our mostpowerful ally.To show why this approach is so urgently needed, let’s look at a dreaded diseasein order to make a much bigger and more optimistic point about well-being. Thedisease is lung cancer. The war against lung cancer poses a stark confrontationbetween smoking on one hand and prevention on the other. The battle lines couldhardly be clearer. Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer among both men andwomen, outstripping the next three cancers combined (breast, colon, andpancreatic). It surprises most people to discover that as far back as 1987, lungcancer surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths amongwomen.The disorder would be rare if it weren’t for tobacco. In 1900, before thegeneral spread of smoking, cases of lung cancer were so uncommon that a doctorin general practice might know of the disease only from textbooks. With thedramatic rise of smoking in modern times, tobacco-related lung cancer accountsfor 90 percent of cases, and when someone stops smoking, the risks decrease yearby year, although they never reach zero.Those are the statistics (as provided by the American Lung Association), andever since the Surgeon General forced tobacco companies to print a warning onevery pack of cigarettes in 1964, sensible prevention has been clear andundeniable. (The sad fact that more women today choose to take up smoking is whylung cancer has increased among women.)But here is where the dividing line between well-being and radical well-beingshows up. The fact is, not all smokers contract lung cancer. Why not? Thepathogens in tobacco smoke are almost guaranteed to damage lung tissue. A hostof respiratory problems, including emphysema and asthma, loom for activesmokers. Yet consider the statistics cited at http://lungcancer.about.com[http://lungcancer.about.com].In a 2006 European study, the risk of developing lung cancer was:0.2 percent for men who never smoked (0.4 percent for women)5.5 percent for male former smokers (2.6 percent for women)15.9 percent for current male smokers (9.5 percent for women)24.4 percent for male “heavy smokers” defined as smoking more than 5 cigarettesper day (18.5 percent for women)An earlier Canadian study quoted the lifetime risk for male smokers at 17.2percent (11.6 percent for women) versus only 1.3 percent in male nonsmokers (1.4percent in female nonsmokers).These percentages translate into a story line. If you don’t smoke, lung canceris very unlikely to strike you. If you take up smoking, the odds against youincrease in a straight line. However, even if you fall into the highest riskcategory of “heavy smokers,” 75 percent of the time you won’t contract lungcancer.We aren’t remotely suggesting that you take your chances and start smoking. Thestory line actually leads in a very different, and unexpected, direction. Why dosome smokers dodge the bullet? This is the million-dollar question thatstatistics do not readily address. What you and I and every other individualwant to know is how our situation will turn out. Lung cancer is only onehorrible example. The statistics around every disease point to some people whomanage to escape getting ill. “How do I become one of those people?” is thequestion that naturally arises.The answer is genetic, but it goes far beyond the cliché that some people havegood genes and some people have bad genes. Imagine tobacco smoke entering thelungs of two people. The toxic chemicals in the smoke are the same for both; theknown carcinogens are the same. When the smoke hits the outer lining of lungtissue, damage is bound to occur—but not necessarily in the same way or to thesame degree.Cells are very resilient, and they make choices all the time. Over millions ofyears of evolution, one choice stands out. Cells choose to fight back againstany threat to their survival. A major threat, and the one that applies totobacco smoke, is deleterious variants that arise in genes called pathogenicmutations. The toxins in tobacco smoke can cause a sudden mutation that leads toa distortion in how the cell operates. But DNA knows how to regulate and repairitself, and the norm is for damaging mutations to be destroyed. There’s a limitto a cell’s healing abilities, but the cell isn’t simply poisoned to death. Withenough exposure to the toxins in tobacco, some distortions will inevitably getby the cell’s defenses, and if enough damage occurs, and if the damage is of aprecise kind, disaster follows. The cell forgets how to divide normally. A cellthat goes on the path of rampant division, overwhelming adjacent cells in itsunregulated growth, has become cancerous.You can see where the story line has now taken us. Behind the statistics for thewhole population, the beginning of a malignancy is about single cells decidingwhat to do, guided by their DNA. Let’s press the investigation further. Whenthree out of four heavy smokers escape lung cancer (by no means are theyguaranteed to escape other serious illness), what choices did their cells make?For it’s those choices that actually rescued them.The best medical knowledge has this to say: Some people are better at fendingoff toxins than others. Some DNA is better at repairing itself and destroyingharmful mutations. Many factors are at work in how a cell heals, and its escapefrom danger is blurred into everything else that’s happening to it. When itcomes to a cell and how it escapes disease, there’s a lot of room foruncertainty. Knowing how a typical cell makes decisions doesn’t tell us how yourcells make decisions. Everyone’s cells are different, based on their specificcomponent of genes and the gene activities you impart to them with yourlifestyle. There’s also the whole issue of the paths your cells will make a day,a month, or ten years from now, because like people, cells can be fickle andchangeable, depending in part on the choices you make.We’ve been dwelling on a grim subject in order to shed light on somethingpositive, the enormous intelligence and resilience of the cell, meaning yourcells. Research has shown that thousands of potentially damaging abnormalitiesare detected and destroyed in our bodies every day. What makes the differencebetween well-being and radical well-being is learning to guide and influenceyour genes in a positive manner.We said that you are more than your genes, just as you are more than your brain.You are the user of your genes and your brain. The key is learning how to usethem so that they afford you optimal health and happiness. Everything you wantto be, every achievement you want to reach, every value you want to uphold mustpass through your brain and your genes in order to become real. So learning tocommunicate with your genes isn’t just a nice add-on. It’s essential. You arealready communicating with your genes, but most of the messages you’re sendingto them are unconscious. Repetition plays a large part. Reactions becomeautomatic and ingrained. This is a terrible waste of your potential to make freechoices.IS DEPRESSION GENETIC?Genetics would be much simpler if it traveled down a one-way street where gene Acould always be connected to disorder B. Linear cause-and-effect is simple andsatisfying. But genes operate on a two-way street, with messages constantlytraveling back and forth—or, to be more accurate, the road is a six-lanesuperhighway, loaded with messages coming from all directions.This realization is having a huge ripple effect throughout medicine and biology,overturning what we thought we knew about the brain, the life of a cell, andalmost every form of disease. To give a prime example, we’ll look at the presentsituation in depression, which directly or indirectly has touched almosteveryone’s life, either through their own suffering or that of a family memberor friend.About 20 percent of people will experience a severe depression sometime in theirlives. At the moment, there is a rash of depression among combat soldiers whoserved in Afghanistan (directly related to a sharp increase in suicides amongAfghanistan war veterans, suicide being generally linked to depression) andamong laid-off workers who are enduring long-term unemployment. In both cases,an outside event led to the depression, but we do not know why, in the sensethat only a certain percentage of people become depressed under the samestimulus (war and losing a job).The link between depression and genes has proved elusive. Nothing as simple as a“depression gene” exists. Early in 2013, the magazine Science News began anarticle on depression with a blanket judgment: “A massive effort to uncover thegenes involved in depression has largely failed.” This news sent shock wavesthrough the medical community, but its impact hasn’t really hit the public,which keeps funding the multibillion-dollar drug industry and its constantproduction of new—and supposedly better—antidepressants. Twenty-seven yearsafter Prozac came on the market in 1988, around one in five Americans takes apsychotropic (mind-altering) drug, despite the proven risk of side effects.Prozac, for example, has three common side effects (hives or skin rash,restlessness, and the inability to sit still); two less common ones (chills orfever and joint or muscle pain); and twenty-five rare ones (including anxiety,fatigue, and increased thirst), according to the website www.drugs.com[http://www.drugs.com].The connection to genes isn’t brought up when the physician is prescribing adrug to relieve a patient’s suffering. However, genes are the pivot between adrug that works and one that doesn’t. The model for depression that has beenaccepted for decades labels depression as a brain disorder. Yet brain disordersare rooted in genetics. The logic is deceptively simple. If you feel depressed,there is an imbalance in the brain chemicals responsible for moods (chiefly theneurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine). Thus in depression, the cellularmechanism that produces these chemicals must be impaired, which comes down toimpaired genes, since genes are the starting point for every process takingplace inside a cell.Why didn’t this simple logic turn out to be true? As prominent researchers nowconcede, the genes of depressed people are not damaged or distorted comparedwith the genes of people who aren’t depressed. What follows from this finding isthat other basic assumptions are wrong. The most popular antidepressantssupposedly worked by repairing chemical imbalances in the synapses—the gapsbetween two nerve endings—where the culprit was an imbalance of serotonin. Butserotonin is directly regulated by genes, and some key research indicates thateither drugs aimed at fixing the serotonin problem don’t work that way or therewasn’t a serotonin problem in the first place. The Science News report didn’tleave much wiggle room on this point: “By combing through the DNA of 34,549volunteers, an international team of 86 scientists hoped to uncover geneticinfluences that affect a person’s vulnerability to depression. But the analysisturned up nothing.” (The study being referenced was published in the January 3,2013, issue of Biological Psychiatry.)Nothing doesn’t mean something. If the chain of explanation running from genesto the synapses and finally to the pharmaceutical lab is broken, a host ofdoubts arises. Is depression a brain disease in the first place, or is it, aspsychiatry assumed before the arrival of modern drug treatment, a disorder ofthe mind? The latest theories haven’t gone back to square one. What we knowisn’t black and white. There are multiple variables in depression, which leadsto some fairly good conclusions:There are many kinds of depression. It isn’t a single disorder.Each depressed person displays their own mixture of possible causes for theirsymptoms.The mental component in depression includes upbringing, learned behavior, corebeliefs, and judgment about the self.The brain component includes wired-in neural pathways, with suggested weaknessesin certain areas of the brain whose cause isn’t understood.Depression can’t be isolated to one region of the brain. The interaction ofmultiple regions is involved.As you can see, these conclusions scuttle a simple cause-and-effect model. “Ifyou have a headache, take an aspirin” doesn’t translate into “If you feeldepressed, take an antidepressant.” The susceptibility to depression is ascomplex as gene expression itself. Why does depression run in families, as it’sknown to do? Again, there’s no simple answer. No gene or group of genes that youinherited seems to guarantee that you will become depressed. We are talkinginstead about genes that make you susceptible to the disorder. What triggersthese (unknown) genes remains a mystery. The same genetic predisposition couldbe hidden in one child who never becomes depressed when he grows up and inanother child who somehow gets triggered into depression. Do socialinteractions, for example, make someone feel helpless and hopeless? That’s howdepression feels, so perhaps (in the epigenome) enough bad memories of feelingleft out or ostracized from others lead to a tipping point and depressionemerges.In our opinion, depression isn’t a brain disorder looking for a magic bullet tosolve it, and the whole disease model must be drastically changed. Even as amedical diagnosis, it’s suspect. The big study about the failure to find thegenes responsible for depression ignored diagnoses of depression and went withsymptoms instead. Asking people about their symptoms resulted in a lower numberof those who would be considered depressed. Perhaps some people are in denial ordon’t know the difference between depression and ordinary sadness. But moreimportant, symptoms change over a lifetime, and there is a sliding scale foreach sufferer. Like emotion in general, depression comes and goes. It feelsdifferent one day than it does another.So will depression ever be curable? The situation is too cloudy for anyone tooffer either a pessimistic or optimistic prediction. Drug treatment remainshugely popular, no matter what the basic science says. In cases of mild tomoderate depression—the most common type—antidepressants sometimes don’t workbetter than 30 percent of the time, around the same as the placebo effect. Somesymptoms of severe depression remain intractable, and yet in other cases, thechronically depressed perform the best with drug treatment. Hope is alwaysbetter than giving up.Now that you understand the situation, with all its uncertainties, you are aheadof the curve, because the vast majority of doctors turn their back on theresearch and keep prescribing the same antidepressants. Millions of patientscontinue to take them, feeling that there is no other way. But there is.Depression doesn’t fit the old disease model, but it does fit the new modelwe’ve been describing. Depression involves lifestyle and environment. Genes playa part but so do behavior, beliefs, and how a person reacts to everydayexperiences. The epigenome is storing genetic reactions of personal experiencesand memories, leading to the constantly shifting activities of your genes."},{"pageContent":"EPIGENETICS AND CANCERLet’s expand on what is known about genes and cancer. Perhaps no disease reliesmore on genome-related risks than cancer. To explain why, we need to backtrack amoment. As mentioned earlier, while still a student at Harvard Medical School,Rudy was thrilled to participate in the first study to ever find the gene for adisorder of unknown cause (Huntington’s disease). Since those pioneering studiesusing genetic analyses in the early 1980s, the hope has been that all of themysteries of inherited disease could be solved by comparing the genome ofpatients versus that of their healthy counterparts. In that total of 6 billionletters, combining A, G, C, and T, inherited from our parents, only about 200million are used to make up the genes. The sparsely distributed genes are likewords in the story of life told by the genome. The remaining 5.8 billion lettersserve to arrange and punctuate those words, potentially creating many variationsof the same story. For the most part, after the Huntington’s disease genediscovery, from 1990 to 2010, geneticists spent most of their time looking fordisease mutations only in the DNA sequence of the genes, like typos in the wordsof the genome story. But epigenetics now tells us that much of the story is inthat intergenic DNA, the regions of the genome that we used to call “junk DNA”lying in between the genes. These regions determine how the story is read andwhich chapters matter most.In an editorial in Nature accompanying the first data to emerge from thecomprehensive catalog known as the Roadmap Epigenome Project, it was stated: “Inhuman diseases, the genome and epigenome operate together. Tackling diseaseusing information on the genome alone has been like trying to work with one handtied behind [one’s] back. The new trove of epigenomic data frees the other hand.It will not provide all the answers. But it could help researchers decide whichquestions to ask.” It turns out that most common diseases with a genetic basisare highly complex, and a large number of factors, ranging from genome mutationsinherited from our parents to epigenetic modifications brought on by lifeexperiences, conspire together to determine one’s risk for specific diseases.In the decades-long war on cancer, definite progress has certainly been made.But according to the American Cancer Society, as of 2015, over 1.6 millionAmericans are still diagnosed with cancer each year and nearly 700,000 succumbto cancers of all types. More than any other disease, cancer has led toincredible progress in understanding the genetic mutations responsible for thedisorder. And, the current belief is that the development of cancer is due tothe accumulation of gene mutations causing the cells to become cancerous andform tumors of various types. However, we now know that the risk for cancer isalso dependent on the way in which epigenetic modifications to the genome rendercertain regions more prone to newly occurring mutations. (To date, the greatestevidence for the role of epigenetics in disease comes from cancer studies, infact.) These mutations can be triggered by exposure to certain environmentaltoxins—for example, dioxin, a lethal family of chemicals found in pesticidemanufacture and waste incineration, for which there is no safe dosage. TheEnvironmental Protection Agency estimates that the damage being caused bydioxins outstrips that caused by DDT in the sixties. An environmental toxin canhave the ability to cause new epigenetic alterations. These can modify how thegenomic DNA in that region is folded, which in turn can potentially affect wherenew mutations are allowed to form.Thus tumor formation involves multiple steps including both genetic andepigenetic alterations in the genome. Unlike gene mutations, the epigeneticmodifications can be considered impermanent and even reversible. Some forms ofcancer are brought on by genes that are activated via a process calledhypomethylation (hypo is a Greek prefix meaning “under”). In this case themethyl marks on genes that silence their activity have somehow become removed.Without a suppressor to hold them back, the harmful genes are activated. Inother cases, the reverse happens. Turning off certain genes via methylation canlead to tumor formation or can involve the addition of acetyl chemical groups tothe histone proteins that wrap around the DNA.New drugs are now being developed that would offset these tumor-causingepigenetic alterations. For example, drugs known as DNA methyltransferaseinhibitors (DNMTIs) act as demethylating agents that can remove methyl marksfrom genes. Such drugs are already used successfully to treat forms of leukemia.Other drugs, called histone acetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, are also being used fortreatment of leukemia and lymphoma. Of course, these so-called epidrugs are notwithout problems, since they are terribly specific in their actions on thegenome. And while they are being used with some success in treating bloodcancers, they have not yet been very effective against solid tumors. While wehope for the best with this new class of epidrugs, we must also consider theneed for studies of lifestyle changes—for example, healthy diet, stressmanagement, exercise, weight control, and the like—that would achieve the sameoutcomes.IS CANCER RANDOM?Randomness is more than a theoretical issue—in our own lives cancer causes amajor portion of human suffering. Twenty years ago, in the 1990s, it was thoughtthat cancer was essentially random, putting almost everyone at equal risk.Genetics reinforced the public image of cancer as ruthlessly impersonal,striking any victim it chose. There were countering arguments. Those who thoughtthat cancer was caused by toxins pointed to tobacco and asbestos as primeexamples. Others who argued for viruses pointed to cervical cancer, which iscaused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It turned out that everyone had apiece of the puzzle, or as one leading cancer expert called it, each camp waslike one of the blind men holding on to a different part of the answer.The current view brings us back to our familiar image, the cloud of causes.Environmental toxins, viruses, and random mutations all play a role, and as withthe puzzle of why Dutch men suddenly became the tallest in the world, the cloudisn’t very satisfactory when trying to link cause and effect. The only realcertainty is that all roads lead eventually to the genome. Cancer of any kind isnow known to need a trigger inside the cell, in the form of a cancer gene(oncogene). There are many such genes, and in recent years they’ve beencataloged by a worldwide effort to formulate the Cancer Atlas, a completegenetic road map to the disease. Besides turning on an oncogene, cancer canbegin by turning off its opposite, the tumor suppression gene.Once one talks about switches being turned on and off, epigenetics enters theequation, and so do questions concerning randomness, because the event thattriggers the switch may not be random at all. Smoking cigarettes isn’t a randomevent. If you smoke, your risk of contracting lung cancer enters the realm ofhigh probability. But the epigenetic explanation for cancer offers as manyproblems as solutions. For one thing, the futile hope that cancer might involvea single gene, which perished three decades ago in the 1980s, has been repeatedin epigenetics—it turns out that while one gene mutation may lead to a certaintype of cancer, the disease seems to involve up to fifty or one hundred genes.Cancer genes can continue to mutate as the cancer spreads, making the malignancya fast-moving, extremely elusive target. Gene-targeted drugs have garneredheadlines by curing specific cancers like one form of childhood leukemia thatinvolves only a single gene.After two decades of searching for similar drugs to wipe out a variety ofcancers, however, success has been very limited. To make matters worse, drugsthat work brilliantly at wiping out all traces of malignancy often have atragically temporary effect. The patient returns after a few months with hiscancer returned. On the surface, it would seem that cancer’s secret weapon ishow quickly and randomly it can mutate, upholding the evolutionary dogma thatrandomness rules.But there are signs pointing in a new direction. Of all diseases, none more thancancer has been clearly linked to epigenetic aberrations.The epigenomes of specific types of cancer cells carry the same epigeneticfingerprint that matches the cell that started the cancer. This serves to revealthe tissue in which the cancer originated, no matter where in the body it isfound. Such information could be of immense use in the future for diagnosing andtreating different forms of cancer, because once it has spread, a tumor hasoften been extremely difficult to trace back to where it started. Furthercomplicating the problem is the cancer cell’s habit of continual mutation.Hopefully, by comparing the epigenomes of healthy and malignant cells, we canbetter understand how the risk for disease can be influenced by much more thanthe genomes provided to us by our parents.It turns out that carefully examining the epigenetic marks (methylation andacetylation) can actually be predictive of which kind of cancer will develop.This revelation turns out to be the opening wedge against random mutations. Asyou live your life, and your environment and experiences chemically govern yourgene activities—we’ve discussed this extensively already—specific new mutationscan arise that are the same for every cell in a particular type of tumor. Soepigenetic modifications lead to predictable new mutations. Something that’spredictable steps away from being purely random.This level of predictability doesn’t solve the entire mystery, however. Byanalogy, think of the weather. On a summer day in August, thunderstorms are verylikely to arise, and their timing can be predicted with a fair degree ofaccuracy—as the heat of the day builds up, a storm is more likely in theafternoon or evening than in the cool of the morning. But the exact movement ofair currents, moisture, and clouds is much less predictable, and if you want toknow the cause of a specific thunderstorm down to the last molecule of air, it’simpossible. In cancer, many mutations often occur simultaneously, and not alllead to bad results. Thousands of possibilities arise, with greatunpredictability. (Because something is unpredictable doesn’t make it random.The next thought you are going to have isn’t random, but it is unpredictable.Cancer research has yet to figure out if cancer is like that or not.)This realization created immense discouragement following hard on the triumphantfindings about the genetic causes of cancer. Oncologists began to mutter aboutcancer as a devious enemy whose arsenal of defenses kept increasing every time asolution seemed to be at hand (a good example of our point in the previouschapter that cancer unfortunately can draw upon the cell’s completeintelligence). Now hope is rising again, because the Cancer Atlas has beensorting out which mutations are the dangerous ones, but just as important—andperhaps the single best clue to curing the disease—it appears that cancerdevelops along some set pathways that are fairly small in number, perhaps only adozen for every kind of malignancy. In other words, there’s a pattern that goeseven further to undercut the orthodox view about random mutations.One promising finding is that certain tumors take many years, even decades, todevelop after the initial trigger starts a cell on an abnormal course. Thethought is that a specific sequence—the genetic pathway that an abnormal cellmust follow—involves a series of steps that must unfold in order. Here’s ananalogy: You’ve probably seen the little handheld games that involve steel BBsrolling around on a board with holes in it, the object of the game being to tiltthe board around until you manage to get all the BBs to fall through a hole. Theholes are tiny, so it’s not an easy challenge. Now imagine that a cancermutation is faced with a similar challenge. It must thread its way through asmall opening (a specific genetic modification out of myriad possibilities) inorder to move on to the next stage. Once that’s accomplished, the next smallopening presents itself in the form of a new mutation out of myriad choices, andso on.If a cancer is typically slow growing, as types of colon and prostate cancerare, it may take thirty or forty years for a cancer cell to follow the wholesequence. The hope is that if detection can be made as early aspossible—detecting the predictable fingerprint of epigenetic markings—cancerwill be conquered long before the first symptoms appear. This glimpse of lightat the end of the tunnel follows from the discovery that the exact genemutations of many types of tumors can now be predicted from the epigenomicsignature of the cell type from which that cancer most likely originated.We must then at least wonder, is it possible that when epigenetic mutationsarise in adults as a result of toxins, stress, trauma, diet, and the like,predictable new mutations will arise in certain cells? If the mutation occurs insperm and egg cells, could they be passed on to the next generation? We don’tyet know. But even the possibility would have made Darwin’s head spin and istoday leading to a major revision of his theory.If epigenetic alterations do lead to specific mutations beyond those that causetumors, then one’s life experiences and environment could, at leasttheoretically, lead to expanded predictability. There could be epigeneticsignatures of other chronic illnesses that appear long before the firstsymptoms. It would be even more amazing if prevention extended to unborngenerations that have been inheriting these marks in the womb. At the time thisbook was being written, such possibilities were only a very intriguing set ofconjectures. Yet it’s fascinating to think about what future studies in thisarea will reveal.ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS AND EPIGENETICSSo far we’ve been focusing on the genetic contributions to disease risk, butthere’s an elephant in the room—the impact of environmental toxins on our genesand epigenome. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found 148different environmental chemicals in the blood and urine of the U.S. population.Increasing evidence gives support to the notion that environmental pollutantslikely cause various diseases by inducing epigenetic changes in our genome, thusaltering the activities of specific genes. For example, arsenic in contaminatedwater dramatically affects methylation of the genome, leading to bladder tumors.Exposure to high levels of other heavy metals (nickel, mercury, chromium, lead,and cadmium) in food and water supplies can also cause changes in genemethylation, leading to various types of cancer, including lung and livercancers. The bottom line is that there are an estimated 13 million deaths ormore worldwide due to environmental pollutants, many of which have been linkedto epigenetic modifications of the genome.We are not alarmists, but it’s important to follow where the science leads.Perhaps no one has advanced our knowledge of this issue as much as Dr. MichaelSkinner, a developmental biologist at Washington State University. In one studySkinner exposed pregnant rats to a chemical known to interfere with embryonicdevelopment, a fungicide called vinclozolin used to keep mold off vineyardgrapes, along with other blights and rots on fruits and vegetables. Vinclozolinhad already been shown to decrease fertility in male mice. The disturbing thingthat Skinner found was that the progeny of the chemically treated mice, all theway down to the fourth or fifth generation, were also affected with low spermcounts. This result was successfully replicated fifteen times.The reason for the disruption of sperm production brought on by vinclozolinwasn’t mutations in the DNA, but epigenetic modifications in the exposed adultmice (via methyl marks), which were then passed on to the next generations.(This is different from what we normally hear about, when actual mutated genesfor disorders get passed on from parents to children, as in sickle cell anemia.)Thus another clue was being added to the existence of “transgenerationalgenetics.”Moreover, Skinner and his colleagues found that there was a specific pattern towhere the methyl marks were attached in the genome after exposing mice todifferent types of chemical toxins. Each toxin, whether it was insecticide orjet fuel, left its own distinctive pattern. In some cases, the shifts beingcaused in gene activity could then be inherited and predispose the offspring tospecific disorders. For example, the insecticide DDT, which has long been bannedin the United States because of its disastrous effects in the food chain ofanimals and birds, also has a specific epigenetic effect. Exposing mice to DDThas been shown to create a predisposition to obesity in later generations, alongwith obesity-associated diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.The range of detrimental epigenetic changes brought on by pesticides is wide.The pesticide methoxychlor, used to protect livestock from fleas, mosquitoes,and other insects, has been shown to cause testicular and ovarian dysfunction inmice. Another pesticide, dieldrin, has dramatic effects on epigeneticmodifications (acetylation) to histones leading in mice to nerve cell deathassociated with Parkinson’s disease. Skinner also showed in mouse studies thatthe common pollutant and carcinogen dioxin, a waste product of many industrialprocesses, causes epigenetic inheritance of prostate disease, kidney disease,and polycystic ovary disease.One of the most carefully studied environmental toxins that can cause abnormalepigenetic changes is bisphenol, or BPA. It has been widely used to make theplastics used in food and beverage containers, including baby bottles. BPA iswell known to cause epigenetic changes. We’ll cite just a sample of relevantstudies. Research at Tufts University showed that BPA can change gene activityin mammary glands of rats exposed to the chemical in the womb, rendering themmore vulnerable to breast cancer later in life. Previously BPA was demonstratedto leave male rats at higher risk for prostate cancer. In another set ofstudies, BPA produced epigenetic changes associated with changing the yellowcolor of a particular breed of mouse as well as increasing the risk for cancer.(Note: One way to avoid BPA exposure among infants is to use glass bottles andcontainers or look for the label “BPA free.”)Finally, diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was used from 1940 to 1960 to preventmiscarriages in pregnant women, has been shown to increase the risk for breastcancer. We now know that this risk is associated with epigenetic changes. Onemust wonder, then, whether these changes are passed down to the nextgenerations, along with the increased risk.Air pollution, especially from particulate matter in vehicular exhaust, alsocauses epigenetic changes that can lead to inflammation throughout the body.Benzene, which is found in gasoline and other oil-based fuels, leads to alteredDNA methylation associated with leukemia. In our water supply, chlorinationleads to by-products with names like trihalomethane, triethyltin, andchloroform, all of which can induce epigenetic changes in the genome. Many ofthese chemicals have been studied for detrimental effects on health. Rats withtriethyltin in their drinking water suffered increased incidence of braininflammation and swelling associated with increased methylation activities.Chloroform and the trihalomethane known as bromodichloromethane increasedmethylation in liver cells in a gene associated with liver disease.Even benign substances we don’t associate with such risks can have a hiddenstory in their production. Alarmingly, many Indian spices sourced from Indiahave been found to be contaminated with heavy metals. The cause is likely theproximity of spice farms to smelting and mining operations and the resulting useof contaminated irrigation water. In 2013 alone, the FDA denied import of morethan 850 spice shipments from around the world. To minimize such risks,U.S.-grown organic spices can be used safely, while care should be taken withthose derived from India and China. Buying from reputable sources with knownbrand names can help. But one must be especially careful with spices obtainedover the Internet or in unbranded, anonymous containers found, for example, insmall neighborhood shops. In many cases, some specialty stores can obtain spicesthat bypass FDA inspection. While only about 2 percent of imported spices arefound by the FDA to be contaminated, you significantly increase your odds ofobtaining them when you buy unbranded spices from anonymous overseas sources.Taken together, there is little doubt that a wide range of environmental toxinsand pollutants can alter our epigenome, resulting in increased susceptibility toa host of different cancers (breast, liver, ovary, lung) and other diseases,including schizophrenia, diabetes, and heart disease. Each person’s exposure isunique and different, which vastly complicates the problem. Some experts foreseethe day when we will visit the doctor to get complete scans of our epigeneticalterations in order to determine our future risk for disease. Will we beincreasingly using epigenetic-based drugs like HDAC inhibitors and RNA-basedtherapeutics to offset these risks and treat disease?These scenarios are beginning to turn into reality. In this book we’ve offeredan alternative you can pursue today, changing your lifestyle to mitigate risk,and perhaps in the future this approach, too, will be fine-tuned to specificepigenetic marks for disease. An even bigger question, based on studies like theones cited here, is whether the epigenetic changes in adults living today willbe inherited by the next generations tomorrow. Dr. Michael Skinner seems to havelittle doubt: “In essence, what your great-grandmother was exposed to couldcause disease in you and your grandchildren.”Along these lines, it will be critically important to continue to be aware ofhow epigenetic modifications arise in response to environmental toxins andpollutants. This is the only way we can move forward, for the good of our ownhealth and the health of generations as yet unborn."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe new genetics has been one of the most rewarding subjects the two authorshave ever written about, and because the ground being covered was vast, we havemany people to thank.
